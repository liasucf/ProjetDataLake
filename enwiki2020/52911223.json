She also is a part of The Global Strategy Network team with industry expert Richard Barrett and other individuals. Fatima is also a children's book writer, and a partner of the Women's Alliance for Security Leadership (WASL). ==Early life and education== Born to Ali Akilu (late Secretary of the defunct Northern region) and Hajia Astajam, Dr. Akilu was educated at the Beechwood Sacred Heart School, Tunbridge Wells. She holds a Ph.D. and MRes in Psychology from Reading University, United Kingdom and a B.A. in English and Psychology from Mount St. Mary's University (Los Angeles). ==Career== Fatima Akilu is a NHS trained forensic psychologist who specializes in the treatment of offenders with developmental and psychiatric disorders, she has over 20 years experience in the field of mental health and psychology. As a youth worker in London, Fatima counselled homeless young people, and while working at a psychiatric hospital in Washington she counselled John Hinckley Jr, the man who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan. She is also a university educator and an advocate for marginalized groups, working in the area of psychology and health for more than two decades. Working as an Adjunct Professor of General Psychology at SUNY Broome Community College (USA) for over 12 years, she has taught and authored several research papers relating to homelessness, ethnicity and their relationship with mental health. Previously Head of Communication for the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals, she was Chairman of the Editorial Board Leadership Newspapers. Akilu was former Director of Behavioral Analysis and Strategic Communication at the Office of the National Security Advisor in Nigeria, where she worked on the country's Countering Violent Extremism Programme between 2012 and 2015. The CVE programme is part of the government's long-term strategy to tackle Boko Haram; the terror group responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 people across Nigeria. Described as a sophisticated and research-based attempt to understand and address the causes and effects of the insurgency, Nigeria's CVE Programme is a multi-disciplinary intervention targeting ex Boko Haram members, youth, and other vulnerable groups through social programmes that provide them with positive alternatives to violent extremism. These programmes focused on the nexus between development and security at the community level. Akilu has worked with liberated wives of Boko Haram commanders, who pose a unique challenge since they often experienced respected and privileged positions within the insurgency society and often long to return. Akilu is currently the Executive Director of Neem Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation founded as a direct response to the problem of insecurity in Nigeria. ==Writing== Akilu is also a children's book writer, who has authored over 17 children's books. She has authored a series of eight books on the Millennium Development Goals for children to teach children about multiculturalism as well as worldwide development issues. She currently leads a campaign to have Nigerian children read 100 books a year. ==Published work== * Ngozi Comes to Town (Cassava Republic Press, 2008) * Timi's Dream Comes True (Cassava Republic Press, 2008) * Ketwa Plays the Drum (Cassava Republic Press, 2011) * Yinka Washes His Hand (Cassava Republic Press) * The Red Transistor Radio (Cassava Republic Press) * The Yellow Mosquito Net (Cassava Republic Press) * Preye and the Sea of Plastic (Cassava Republic Press) * Aliyah Learns a New Dance (Cassava Republic Press) * Zahra and Coco Alphabet (Mockingbird Publishers) * Ashraf: Flying Saucer (Mockingbird Publishers, 2011) ==Awards and recognition== * Zahra and Coco Alphabet, 2012 Winner of Moonbeam Children's Book Award's Gold prize in the Alphabet/ Counting Book category. * \u2018Preye and the Sea of Plastics\u2019 by Fatima Akilu and \u2018Mayowa and the Masquerade\u2019 by Lola Shoneyin: Joint Winners for the ANA/Atiku Abubakar Prize for Children's Literature. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Nigerian psychologists Category:Alumni of the University of Reading ",
