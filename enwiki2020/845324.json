    "text": "Station Road, Llanishen Llanishen (Welsh Llanisien llan church + Isien Saint Isan) is a district and community in the north of Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. The Cardiff community population taken at the 2011 census was 17,417. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000852 Llanishen is well known as the home of the 'Tax Offices', the tallest buildings in north Cardiff and a landmark for miles around. The office complex overlooks the 'Crystal and Fishguard estates', Parc T\u0177 Glas industrial estate, old village, leafy suburban roads and various parkland that constitute the district. Llanishen is also home to a fully featured Leisure Centre and the former Llanishen Reservoir \u2013 a local beauty spot that is connected to a green corridor which bisects the city from the rising hills in the north to Cardiff Bay in the south. St Isan's parish church ==History== Originally wooded farm land, in A.D. 535 two monks came eastwards from the small religious settlement of Llandaff, aiming to establish new settlements, or \"llans\", in the land below Caerphilly mountain. With fresh water from the Nant Fawr stream, one of the monks Isan founded his llan on the site of the modern day Oval Park. In 1089 in the Battle of the Heath, the Normans fought the Welsh Celts north of the settlement. The victorious Normans expanded Llanishen, starting work on a church to the north which was completed in the 12th century. Although Oliver Cromwell had ties with Llanishen and the neighbouring village of Llysfaen, the village remained undisturbed until 1871, when the Rhymney Railway was given permission to break the stranglehold of the Taff Vale Railway into Cardiff Docks. Building a line from Caerphilly to Crockherbtown Junction just north of Cardiff Queen Street, its tunnel to the north resulted in a number of accidental deaths, many of whom are buried in St Isans church. The railway and the development of Llanishen railway station allowed wealthy Cardiff business people to commute from the village to the centre of city easily, resulting in the expansion of the villages population by 20,000 between 1851 and 1871. In 1887, the two new reservoirs of Llanishen were built to allow distribution of water collected in the Brecon Beacons to the city. In 1922, after expansion north by the city and south by the village, Llanishen became a suburb of Cardiff. Llanishen Golf Club was established in 1905. Development of the village since has been through redevelopment of the former farming and military land into commercial usage and housing development. Thornhill was part of the Llanishen civil parish until November 2016 when a new community of Thornhill was created north of the Linear Park.Ruth Mosalski (23 March 2015) \"No longer will housebuyers be able to mock estate agents... Pontcanna is set to be one of four city 'areas' given official status\", Wales Online. Retrieved 16 January 2018. ==Commerce and Industry== ===Parc T\u0177 Glas Industrial Estate=== HM Government buildings, Phase 2 (left) and Gleider House \u2013 Phase 1 (right) and Ty Rhodfa in the foreground Parc T\u0177 Glas is home to the offices of the television station S4C and of the National Eisteddfod of Wales. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) occupies an 18-storey tower block (Phase 2) plus some of the 11-storey Gleider House (Phase 1) in a complex of HM Government offices, employing more than 2,700 staff on site in late 2007 (mainly Revenue division \u2014 including an enquiry centre, or IREC). In 2003, a retail complex of six stores was built; the current occupants are Marks and Spencer Simply Food, Boots, Laura Ashley, HomeSense, Starbucks, DW sports/MiFit, Pets at Home and Carphone Warehouse. The HM Government buildings are due to be vacated by HMRC at the end of 2020 and, with the exception of Ty Gleider, demolished to be replaced by family houses and apartments. ===ROF Cardiff=== The First World War, like in many locations, brought death to the young men of the village, but the Second World War brought greater effect. With the development of ROF Bridgend, a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Cardiff was opened in 1940 to take the explosives from Bridgend and produce tank, anti-tank and field guns. Air defences against paratroopers were placed in nearby fields, but this was strengthened in 1941 when the Royal Air Force established both a RAF Regiment base and a glider training facility. In 1943 the United States Army began using the facilities to hold troops and undertake local training, including basic flight in Tiger Cubs. The Americans left in June 1944 as the Allies prepared for D-Day. In 1987 ROF Cardiff became an Atomic Weapons Establishment. It closed down in February 1997. ROF Cardiff since closure has become the site of major housing development: George Wimpey called theirs 'Parklands', Barratt built 'Ty Glas Square' and Leadbitter built 'Llys Enfys', with Bellway and Persimmon/Charles Church creating even more housing between the AWE site and the HMRC building. The site will also host a new public open space, the final element to be constructed (2010), to include children's play area, sports pitch and community garden. Part of the George Wimpey development has been named 'Watkins Square' and the Barratt development 'Tasker Square' \u2013 after Wales' famous Victoria Cross winner Sir Tasker Watkins, who died during 2007. ===Other offices=== The Orchards complex The Orchards complex, formerly the site of the National Coal Board's regional office, housed the offices of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and the Welsh office of the Camelot Group, operators of the UK National Lottery.

Llanishen Reservoir forms the end of a Victorian water supply system stretching from the Brecon Beacons to Cardiff and has recently had its CADW listing confirmed. It had been under threat from an American-led commercial development for domestic housing, where the proposed houses would be built around a reduced lake. But the CADW designation plus the Site of Special Scientific Interest for grassland fungi on the embankments of the former reservoir, will make it very difficult for a developer to gain building permission. Locals are campaigning to make the area a registered village green. ===Cardiff Sailing Centre=== Cardiff Sailing Centre (Llanishen Sailing Centre) is a sailing school teaching sailing, windsurfing and powerboating. ===Llanishen Leisure Centre=== Llanishen Leisure Centre Llanishen Leisure Centre is situated in Llanishen and is the largest in the city.
