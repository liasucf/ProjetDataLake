    "text": "Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco (15 January 1955 - 14 December 1984) was a Spanish road racing cyclist. His son Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Sainz is also a road racing cyclist. Fern\u00e1ndez was born in Cuena, Cantabria. As an amateur, he won the Spanish mountain bike championships, and turned professional in 1978. During his career, he was nicknamed el Galleta (\"the Biscuit\"), because the town where he lived, Aguilar de Campoo, had several biscuit factories. Fern\u00e1ndez tested positive for the stimulant Methylphenidate (Ritalin) on stage 17 of the 1982 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. His best results came during the last two years of his career. He finished 10th overall in the 1982 Tour de France, and 3rd in his first appearance in the 1983 Giro d'Italia. He also finished 3rd in the 1983 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, improving to 2nd in 1984, only 6 seconds behind winner \u00c9ric Caritoux (the shortest winning margin in any of the Grand Tours). He and his wife died in a car accident in December 1984, just short of his 30th birthday. ==Major results== ;1975 : 1st Subida a Gorla ;1976 : 7th Overall Tour de l'Avenir ;1978 : 2nd Overall Vuelta a los Valles Mineros : 4th Overall Vuelta a Cantabria : 5th Subida a Arrate : 7th Overall Vuelta a Asturias : 8th Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme : 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1979 : 1st Overall Vuelta a Asturias : 3rd Clasica de Sabi\u00f1\u00e1nigo : 5th Overall Vuelta a la Comunidad Valenciana : 9th Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1980 : 1st Overall Tour of the Basque Country ::1st Stage 5b (ITT) : 1st Overall Vuelta a los Valles Mineros ::1st Stage 3a : 1st Stage 3 Vuelta a Cantabria : 1st Stage 4 Costa del Azahar : 6th Overall Deutschland Tour : 8th Overall Volta a Catalunya ;1981 : 1st Overall Vuelta a los Valles Mineros ::1st Stage 3a : 1st Overall Vuelta a la Comunidad Valenciana ::1st Stage 4b (ITT) : 2nd Overall Vuelta a La Rioja : 3rd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme ::1st Stage 2b (ITT) : 3rd Overall Escalada a Montjuich : 6th Overall Volta a Catalunya : 6th Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n : 6th Subida al Naranco : 10th Overall Vuelta a Andalucia ;1982 : 1st 20px Overall Volta a Catalunya ::1st Stage 7a : 1st Stages 3 & 4b Vuelta a Burgos : 1st Stage 1 Tour of the Basque Country : 1st Stage 3 (ITT) Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en : 3rd Overall Vuelta a Andalucia : 8th Overall Paris\u2013Nice : 10th Overall Tour de France ;1983 : 1st Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme ::1st Stage 2 : 1st Memorial Gastone Nencini : 1st Subida a Arrate : 3rd Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st Stages 6 & 17 : 3rd Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ::1st Stage 5 : 5th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 5th Subida al Naranco : 8th Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1984 : 1st Trofeo Masferrer : 2nd Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 2nd Overall Vuelta Asturias ::1st Stages 3 & 4 : 5th Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 5th Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme === Grand Tour general classification results timeline === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 1978 ! scope=\"col\" | 1979 ! scope=\"col\" | 1980 ! scope=\"col\" | 1981 ! scope=\"col\" | 1982 ! scope=\"col\" | 1983 ! scope=\"col\" | 1984 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey/alt=A gold jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a | 19 | 14 | \u2014 | DNF | 15 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |3 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |2 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |3 | 19 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France | \u2014 | \u2014 | 25 | 21 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" | 10 | \u2014 | \u2014 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1955 births Category:1984 deaths Category:People from Campoo Category:Cantabrian cyclists Category:Spanish male cyclists Category:Spanish Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Spanish Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners Category:Spanish sportspeople in doping cases Category:Road incident deaths in Spain Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists ",
