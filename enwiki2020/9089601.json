    "text": "Newcastle c. 1890 Henry Pelham Archibald Douglas Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (28 September 1864 \u2013 30 May 1928), was an English nobleman, styled Earl of Lincoln until 1879. ==Biography== Henry was educated at Eton College and then Magdalen College, Oxford. He held a number of local offices appropriate with his rank and station, such as High Steward of Retford, Master Forester of Dartmoor and Keeper of St Briavel's Castle. He had poor health and played only a small part in public life. As a staunch Anglo- Catholic he spoke on ecclesiastical issues in the House of Lords. One of his achievements was the restoration of the fortunes of his family estate. In 1879 a serious fire destroyed much of Clumber House; he had it magnificently rebuilt to designs by the younger Charles Barry. The duke was actively involved in the rebuilding process, and in particular in the design and building of the magnificent St Mary the Virgin Chapel in the grounds. He was also responsible for the establishment of the Clumber Choir School. His Thames Valley estate was at Forest Farm in Winkfield. Some of the 7th Duke's personal papers are now held at Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham. == Family == He was married to Kathleen Florence May Candy in 1889. == External links == * Biography of the 7th Duke, with links to online catalogues, from Manuscripts and Special Collections at The University of Nottingham Category:1864 births Category:1928 deaths Category:19th-century English nobility Category:20th-century English nobility Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford 007 Henry Category:English Anglo-Catholics Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from Bassetlaw District Category:People from Winkfield Category:Members of the London School Board Henry ",
