Freedom House stated that years of increasing state capture, abuse of power, authoritative and populist leadership had tipped country over the edge, and for the first time since 2003, Montenegro was no longer categorised as a democracy. The report emphasised the unequal electoral process, cases of political arrests, negative developments related to judicial independence, media freedoms, as well as a series of unresolved cases of corruption within the DPS-led government. ===Accusations of electoral fraud=== All 39 opposition MPs (out of 81 in total) started boycotting Parliament since the constitution of its current convocation in December 2016, due to claims of electoral fraud and that the elections were not held under fair conditions, at the 2016 parliamentary elections. They are demanding snap elections and reform of electoral laws. ===The \"Atlas\" and \"Envelope\" affairs=== In mid-January 2019, a video clip from 2016 surfaced in which businessman Du\u0161ko Kne\u017eevi\u0107, chairman of the Montenegro-based Atlas Group, appeared to hand the Mayor of Podgorica and high-ranked ruling party member, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, an envelope containing what Kne\u017eevi\u0107 later said was $97,000, to fund a Democratic Party of Socialists parliamentary election campaign.Objavljen snimak: Kne\u017eevi\u0107 uru\u010dio kovertu Stijepovi\u0107u, Antena M ====Anti-corruption protests==== Protests against corruption within Montenegrin DPS-lead government have started in February 2019 soon after the revelation of footage and documents that appear to implicate top officials in obtaining suspicious funds for the ruling party. ===Controversial religion law and protests=== As of late December 2019, the newly proclaimed religion law which de-jure transfers the ownership of church buildings and estates from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro to the Montenegrin state, sparked a series of massive protests followed with road blockages, which continued to 2020. ==See also== *Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107 *Government of Montenegro ==References== Category:Government of Montenegro Category:Cabinets established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in Montenegro ",
