Variety said it \"stirred up the best cinema biz of any German film in this country, coining plenty for its distributor.\" The movie had led to a number of imitators, including The Truth About Rosemarie. Producer Dieter Fritko announced he was making a film called The Truth About Rosemarie which would star Heinz Pohlmann, the Frankfurt salesman who spent a year in jail on suspicion of Rosemarie's murder. This prompted much controversy. According to Variety, SPIO, the leading German film industry organization, was criticized in the trades for not taking a definite stand against the film \"on the grounds of questionable taste\". The first distributor that was announced for the film withdrew due to the controversy. A new distributor was found, Emil Reinegger, of Union Film. SPIO eventually suggested that none of its members in the technical, export, distribution or theatre-operating branches have anything to do with the film. Reinegger complained that no one from SPIO had discussed the story with him and said that Pohlmann will only work on the film and not appear in it. The script was reportedly based on the 19 volume police record. Production took place in Munich. It was one of a series of sexually aggressive characters played by Belinda Lee in European films. == Censorship == When Love Now, Pay Later was first released in Italy in 1959 with the title L'Inferno addosso, the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities rated it as VM16: not suitable for children under 16.

Lee approaches the role of Rosemarie with all the style and subtley of a tiger shark after a swimmer with a free bleeding cut.\" ==References== ==External links== * *She Walks by Night (alternative title) at Letterbox DVD *Film page at BFI Category:1959 films Category:1959 drama films Category:German drama films Category:West German films Category:German-language films Category:Films about prostitution in Germany Category:Films based on actual events ",
