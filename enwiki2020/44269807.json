From an early age, Thomsen was interested in drawing but his parents first encouraged him to study philosophy. After he had graduated in 1866, he began studying art with Frederik Vermehren the same year. He then attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Wilhelm Marstrand, graduating in 1871. He completed his studies in Italy at the end of the 1870s together with Kristian Zahrtmann and August Jerndorff. Thomsen exhibited in Carlottenborg from 1869. His earlier works include the genre paintings Ved eksamensbordet (At the Examination Desk, 1874) and Moder og datter (Mother and Daughter, 1875). In 1888, his Middag i en pr\u00e6steg\u00e5rd efter en bispevisitats (Dinner in a Rectory after a Bishop's Visit) earned him several awards including the Neuhausen Prize and gold medals in Munich and Antwerp.
