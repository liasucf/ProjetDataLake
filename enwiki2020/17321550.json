Since April 2010 the company began expanding the Table Table brand further as it continued to enjoy the success of most profitable restaurant brand based on a number of sites. Although making one of the smallest profit for Whitbread, Table Table was on average the second best performing throughout 2009 based on a site average following Taybarns. Table Table has continued this success being the best performing restaurant brand within Whitbread in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The conversion of Brewers Fayres to Table Tables has now come to an end following a successful relaunch of the Brewers Fayre brand and both brands are now expanding in their own markets. All new Table Table restaurants are new build alongside new Premier Inns ==Future and trials== Despite the popularity of the brand, during summer\u2013autumn 2012, a number of Table Table pubs were converted back to Brewers Fayre such as The Brampton Hut and Howgate. From 2014 a number of selected Table Table pub restaurants, including the Hobbs Boat in Weston, the Liskeard Tavern in Liskeard, The Carclaze in St Austell, The Roundstone in Littlehampton and The Globe Inn located in Christchurch, have been converted to a new brand called Whitbread Inn, harking back to the company's past.
