It was released in May 1993 and it reached #4 on the Australian ARIA charts. It is included on his 1993 \"Flesh and Wood\" album, his 1996 \u201cBarnes Hits Anthology\u201d compilation, his 2001 \u201cRaw\u201d album and as a duet on his 2014 \u201c30:30 Hindsight\u201d album, with Tina Arena and Joe Bonamassa. ==Details== The song was the first time that Barnes had collaborated with former members of Cold Chisel since the band's demise. He said, \"When Ian Moss played guitar on it in the studio, it was all so Chisel-esque that it made the hairs stand up on the back of our necks when we played it back. You tend to forget how great a songwriter Don Walker is until you sing his songs.\" Don Walker had been the main songwriter in Cold Chisel, and Barnes had requested his contribution. Barnes said, \"Now, let me clarify that it wasn't exactly the first time. I had asked Don for help in the past but he hadn't responded.\" ==Lyrics== \"Stone Cold\" is a blues rock love song, which sees the singer returning home drunk (or 'stoned') to his lover, telling her he's \"stoned... stone cold in love with you\" ==Track listing== ; CD Single # Stone Cold 3:46 # Stone Cold (Live) 4:18 # Wheels in Motion 3:20 ; CD/ Cassette Maxi # Stone Cold # Stand Up (Live) # Stone Cold (Live) # Catch Your Shadow (Acoustic) # Stone Cold (Acoustic) # Working Class Man (Acoustic) ==Charts== In May 1993,\u201cStone Cold\u201d debuted at #28 in Australia, before peaking at #4, five weeks later. ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\" |- !scope=\"row\" |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Singles Chart | 22 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist Singles Chart | 2 |- |} ===Sales and certifications=== ==References== Category:Mushroom Records singles Category:1993 singles Category:1993 songs Category:Jimmy Barnes songs Category:Song recordings produced by Don Gehman Category:Songs written by Don Walker (musician) ",
