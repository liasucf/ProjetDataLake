Takashi soon gets into much trouble and starts to have a bad reputation because of Taro such as giving his childhood friend Kyoko an explosive bomb for her birthday (which Taro had switched with a Taro doll Takashi had meant to give Kyoko).

When they went back to the beginning of the hall, Takashi finds that Taro's room was hidden near the entrance of Taro's house.
