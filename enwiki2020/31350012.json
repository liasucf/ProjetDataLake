    "text": "Madonna of the Fish, known also as Madonna with the Fish is a painting by the High Renaissance master Raphael. Mary sits enthroned with the Jesus on her knee. On one side is St. Jerome kneeling by the Lion; he is holding a book. On the other side the archangel Raphael is presenting at the foot of the throne the young Tobias, whom he formerly guided to the River Tigris, and who bears the miraculous fish whose heart, liver and gall were to restore his father's sight, and drive the demons from his bride. Tobias with his fish was an early type of baptism. Raphael leading Tobias always expresses protection, and especially protection to the young. The picture is believed to have been painted around 1512-14 to commemorate the introduction of Book of Tobit to the canonical books of the Roman Catholic Church. St. Jerome translated the Book of Tobit into Latin, which explains his presence on the right of Mary.1912 review of Madonna and the Fish on It is currently held by the Museo del Prado, Madrid. ==Notes== Category:1506 paintings Category:Raphael Madonnas Category:Lions in art Raphael Category:Fish in art Category:Paintings of Raphael (archangel) category:Paintings depicting Tobias Category:Books in art ",
