    "text": "The Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction \\widehat{\\varepsilon} is a statistical method of adjusting for lack of sphericity in a repeated measures ANOVA. The correction functions as both an estimate of epsilon (sphericity) and a correction for lack of sphericity. The correction was proposed by Samuel Greenhouse and Seymour Geisser in 1959. The Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction is an estimate of sphericity (\\widehat{\\varepsilon}). If sphericity is met, then \\varepsilon = 1 . If sphericity is not met, then epsilon will be less than 1 (and the degrees of freedom will be overestimated and the F-value will be inflated). To correct for this inflation, multiply the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser estimate of epsilon to the degrees of freedom used to calculate the F critical value. An alternative correction that is believed to be less conservative is the Huynh\u2013Feldt correction (1976). As a general rule of thumb, the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction is the preferred correction method when the epsilon estimate is below 0.75. Otherwise, the Huynh\u2013Feldt correction is preferred. ==See also== * Mauchly's sphericity test * Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) ==References== Category:Estimation methods ",
