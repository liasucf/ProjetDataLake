Saar was born at the small borough of H\u00fcpassaare (now in Karjasoo, Suure-Jaani Parish), Viljandi County, Estonia, then part of the Livonian Governorate, Russian Empire, to Mihkel and Ann Saar (n\u00e9e Kimmel). His father was employed in the forestry business. He was the eldest of fours siblings; Anna (1885-1968), Hans (1895-1979) and Jaan (1897-1898). He received his education in the village school at Kaansoo and the Suure-Jaani Parish school. His music teacher in the Suure-Jaani parish school was Joosep Kapp, the father of Artur Kapp, another famous Estonian composer. Additionally, Saar's father was a talented organist, who gave him lessons at home. ==Adult life== In 1901, Saar left home to study music at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He graduated in 1908 but chose to continue his studies. After graduation in 1911, he became a music teacher in Tartu. Ten years later, in 1921, he moved to Tallinn, Estonia as a freelance composer and organist. He spent his summers in his native borough H\u00fcpassaare. In August 1915, he married Elise Paalmann. The couple would have two children; a daughter Heli (1917-1975) and a son, \u00dclo (1927-1945). The marriage would end in divorce when Elise moved to the United States in 1937, initially expecting Saar to join her. However, Saar decided that he didn't wish to leave Estonia.

Later in his life, Saar combined Estonian folk music with more contemporary sounds. He mixed vocals into his symphonies. In addition to composing, Saar also wrote lyrics to some of his songs.
