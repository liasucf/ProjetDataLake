The unique diamond design was named The Queen Sirikit Diamond consisting of 60 facets and a combination of the radiant and brilliant cut diamonds to bring out the maximum brightness and dispersion of light to the viewer. Several years after the Queen Sirikit Cut was introduced, Ho created another special diamond for the late King Bhumibol Adulydej on the occasion of his 68th birthday. Patents for both of the above mentioned diamond cuts are held by Ho. In 1995, the Golden Jubilee, the world\u2019s largest faceted diamond of 545.67 carats was purchased from De Beers by a group of Thai business people led by Henry Ho in 1995. It was arranged for the diamond to be given to King Bhumibol as a gift from the people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the King\u2019s ascent to the throne. The yellow- brown diamond was named the Golden Jubilee, blessed by Pope John Paul II and was received by the King\u2019s daughter, Princess Matia Chari Sirindhom on his behalf in 2000. The diamond is now on display in the Royal Museum at Pimammek Golden Temple Throne Hall in Bangkok as part of the crown jewels. Ho also served as the Honorary Consul-General of Bhutan to Thailand from 1995 to 2008. ==Recent activities== ===The Ruby Heart of Love - World Ruby Forum 2017=== The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) under the Ministry of Commerce collaborated with the Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences (AIGS) and the Association of Gemmology of France (AFG) to host the first ever World Ruby Forum 2017, an international academic conference aimed to establish ruby as Thailand\u2019s most important exported gem.
