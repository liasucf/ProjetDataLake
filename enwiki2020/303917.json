    "text": "Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury is the debut album by alternative hip hop crew The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, released in 1992. Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury found some critical acclaim, although the album leaned away from the then-rising G-Funk that came to be the dominant subgenre within West Coast hip hop. \"Television, the Drug of the Nation\" was released as a single. It was recorded previously by Michael Franti's first band, the Beatnigs. == Critical reception == In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that, although some of the ideas and metaphors are unconvincing, Michael Franti's \"intellectual grasp thrusts him immediately into pop's front rank\". He also praised DJ Rono Tse as \"a one-man hip hop band\" who, with the help of percussionist Mark Pistel, \"creates more music than he samples, stretching Bomb Squad parameters to carry the tracks whenever Franti falters.\" Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury finished number 19 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it number 14 in his own list. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Ned Raggett said that the group \"tackled every last big issue possible with one of 1992's most underrated efforts.\" He felt that, while its mix of \"Bomb Squad and industrial music approaches\" make it an appealing album, Franti's thematic breadth and \"rich voice\" are highlights. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1992/93) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian (ARIA Charts)||59 |} ==Samples== * \"Satanic Reverses\" ** Miles Davis - \"Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\" * \"Famous and Dandy\" ** Herbie Hancock - \"Watermelon Man\" * \"Television, the Drug of the Nation\" ** The Meters - \"Look-Ka-Py-Py\" * \"Language of Violence\" ** This Mortal Coil - \"Barramundi\" * \"The Winter of the Long Hot Summer\" ** This Mortal Coil - \"Waves Become Wings\" ** Wally Badarou - \"Ayers Rock Bubble Eyes\" * \"Everyday Life Has Become a Health Risk' ** Public Enemy - \"Terminator X to the Edge of Panic\" * \"California \u00dcber Alles\" ** \"California \u00dcber Alles\" by Dead Kennedys * \"Water Pistol Man\" ** Wally Badarou - \"Leaving this Place\" Rap Sample FAQ ==Personnel== *John Baker - Engineer *Kim Buie - Art Direction *The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy - Editing, Art Direction, Mixing *Michael Franti - Arranger, Programming, Vocals, Backing Vocals *Vivian Hall *Mark Heimback- Nielsen - Art Direction, Design *Charlie Hunter - Bass, Guitar, Vocals, Voices *Jeff Mann - Post Production Engineer *Mark Pistel - Arranger, Programming, Engineer, Mixing *Pete Scaturro - Engineer *Rono Tse - Percussion, Drums, Drums (Steel), Noise, Sheet Metal *Barbara Walker - Assistant Photographer *Howie Weinberg - Mastering *Simone White - Drums *Mat Callahan - Engineer *Jack Dangers - Mixing *Victor Hall - Art Direction, Photography *Jay Blakesberg - Photography *Sean Mathis - Assistant Photographer ==References== Category:The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy albums Category:1992 debut albums Category:4th & B'way Records albums ",
