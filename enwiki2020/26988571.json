    "text": "Ernst Hiemer (5 July 1900 in Gro\u00dfweingarten \u2013 29 July 1974 in Alt\u00f6tting) was a German writer, who worked closely with Julius Streicher, the founder of the anti-Semitic newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer. Hiemer's three main books were all published in the Second World War and had anti-Semitic themes. ==Biography== Hiemer began working with Julius Streicher in the 1920s, as a journalist for Streicher's weekly anti-Semitic newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer, for which he reported on trials of Jewish offenders.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience (Harvard University Press, 2003), p. 230. Using the knowledge and experience he had gained working as a teacher, Hiemer wrote two anti-Semitic books for children which were both published by Julius Streicher's St\u00fcrmer publishing house.Gregory Wegner, Anti-semitism and Schooling Under the Third Reich (Routledge, 2002), p. 158. The first of these was Der Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom), published in 1938. This was a collection of 17 short stories, illustrated by 'Fips' (Philipp Rupprecht). It was followed in 1940 by another collection, Der Pudelmopsdackelpinscher und andere besinnliche Erzahlungen (The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pinscher and other contemplative stories), which compared Jews to various forms of animals. These publications were amongst the most extreme anti-Semitic items produced for children under the Nazi regime, causing them to be the subject of negative comments from some Nazis. During this time, Hiemer was also the chief editor of Der St\u00fcrmer. In 1942, he published a collection of anti-Semitic proverbs entitled Der Jude im Sprichwort der V\u00f6lker. After the war, Hiemer was interned for three and a half years at Stalag XIII-D, and banned from teaching for life. He died on 29 July 1974 in Alt\u00f6tting, Bavaria. ==Bibliography== *Der Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom) (Nuremberg: St\u00fcrmerverlag, 1938). *Der Pudelmopsdackelpinscher (The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pinscher, 1940) (Nuremberg: Der St\u00fcrmer-Buchverlag) *Der Jude im Sprichwort der V\u00f6lker (Nuremberg, 1942) ==References== ==External links== *Excerpts from Der Pudelmopsdackelpinscher and Der Giftpilz at the German Propaganda Archive *Articles from Der St\u00fcrmer: 1935, 1942 and 1943 *Full text of Der Giftpilz in German and in English at the Internet Archive *Full text of Der Jude im Sprichwort der Voelker at the Internet Archive Category:1900 births Category:1974 deaths Category:German newspaper editors Category:Nazi propaganda Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:People from Roth (district) ",
