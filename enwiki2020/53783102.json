    "text": "Karl Mikhailovich Peterson (1828\u20131881) was a Russian mathematician, known by an earlier formulation of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations. == Life and work == Peterson was born in a peasant family. He studied at the Gymnasium of Riga and, after, in the university of Dorpat (now Tartu under Ferdinand Minding., pages 141\u20132. Nothing of his life is known about the ten years after his graduation. In unknown date he went to Moscow where he taught in the German Gymnasium Peter and Paul of this city from 1865., page 157. Peterson never had an academic position at university level, but he was one of the founders of the Moscow Mathematical Society with Nikolai Brashman and August Davidov. Peterson was a notable collaborator in the journal of the Society and he is considered the founder of the Moscow school of geometry., page 24. Peterson gave, in his graduation dissertation (1853, but not published until later), an earliest formulation of the fundamental equations of the surface theory,, page 335. now usually known as Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations, sometimes Peterson\u2013Codazzi equations. During his time in Moscow, Peterson published some important papers about differential geometry., pages 156\u20139. In 1879, the university of Odessa awarded him an honorary degree. == References == == Bibliography == * * * == External links == * * Category:19th-century Russian people Category:19th- century mathematicians Category:1828 births Category:1881 deaths Category:Scientists from Riga Category:University of Tartu alumni ",
