Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2017 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden stated \"Pianist Kenny Barron's star began to rise in the 1980 as he recorded more frequently as a leader. Uptown releases such as this one have been hard to find because of erratic distribution, but this trio date with bassist Rufus Reid and drummer Frederick Waites (in one of his last record dates prior to his death in 1989) is worth the effort to acquire it ... The pristine sound achieved by legendary engineer Rudy Van Gelder is an added bonus. Highly recommended\". == Track listing == All compositions by Kenny Barron except where noted. # \"New York Attitude\" - 5:58 # \"Embraceable You\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 5:49 # \"Joanne Julia\" - 5:39 # \"My One Sin (In Life)\" (Vittoria Mascheroni, Gian Testoni, Robert Mellin ) - 5:23 Bonus track on CD reissue # \"Bemsha Swing\" (Thelonious Monk, Denzil Best) - 6:50 # \"Autumn in New York\" (Vernon Duke) - 8:00 # \"Lemuria\" - 5:08 # \"You Don't Know What Love Is\" (Gene de Paul, Don Raye) - 6:24 Bonus track on CD reissue # \"Embraceable You\" [take 1] (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 7:49 Bonus track on CD reissue == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *Rufus Reid \u2013 bass *Frederick Waits - drums == References == Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1985 albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Uptown Records (jazz) albums ",
