It is represented in the Mississippi Army National Guard by the 1st Squadron, 98th Cavalry, an element of the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team. ==History== The 1st Squadron, 98th Cavalry of the Mississippi National Guard follows the lineage of the 1st Battalion, 198th Armor Regiment and A Troop, 98th Cavalry. An earlier unit to carry this unit designation was another Mississippi unit that later became the 2nd Squadron, 198th Armor in the Mississippi Delta and, later still, the 2nd Battalion, 198th Armor. The 1st Squadron traces its lineage back to the 750th Tank Battalion, which was constituted in the Mississippi Army National Guard and organized on 1 May 1959 by the redesignation of existing companies. Part of the 31st Infantry Division's headquarters at Greenville (previously organized on 22 May 1956) was redesignated as the 750th's Headquarters, Headquarters, and Service Company. Company C of the 134th Engineer Battalion at Leland, which had been organized on 22 May 1956, became Company A. Company B was redesignated from the 114th Field Artillery Battalion's Service Battery at Indianola, which had been organized on 10 April 1947. Company C was redesignated from Company E of the 155th Infantry at Cleveland. Company E was organized on 4 December 1929 and inducted into Federal service on 25 November 1940. It served with the 31st Division in World War II and was inactivated at Camp Stoneman on 12 December 1945. The company was reorganized and Federally recognized on 28 May 1947. It was ordered into active Federal service on 16 January 1951 during the Korean War, but remained stateside and was released from active service on 30 June 1954. The 750th was redesignated as the 1st Squadron, 98th Cavalry, on 1 May 1963, part of the 31st Division. On 15 February 1968, the regiment was reorganized to consist of Troop D, a non-divisional unit at Jackson. ==Distinctive Unit Insignia== * Description A Silver color metal and enamel device 1 3/8 inches (3.49 cm) in width overall consisting of a shield blazoned as follows: Per bend sinister Gules and Argent, between in dexter chief a lightning flash bendwise Or and in sinister base a griffin's head erased Vert, a sinister bend wavy Azure (Flag Blue).
