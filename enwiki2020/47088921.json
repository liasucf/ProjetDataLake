    "text": "Tim Hyde (1908\u20131967) was an Irish National Hunt racing jockey during the 1930s and 1940s. Hyde began his career in show jumping before becoming an amateur jockey in National Hunt racing. After turning professional he had immediate success, winning the Irish Grand National in 1938 on Clare County and the Grand National in 1939 on Workman. He then became the regular partner of Prince Regent who won the Irish Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. In 1951 he suffered a fall while showjumping, which left him partially paralysed for the rest of his life. Despite using a wheelchair, he trained horses for several years at Camas Park stables in Cashel, County Tipperary. His son, also named Tim, became a very successful bloodstock agent and breeder. His grandson and great-grandson are also named Tim, and have continued the family tradition of riding a winner. https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/racing/memorable-day- for-hyde-family-as-tim-continues-great-tradition-468520.html Hyde died in 1967. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Irish jockeys ",
