The site was vital to the development of the VVER design; every unit built was essentially a prototype of its design. On this site is built the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II. ==History== In 2002 Novovoronezh-3 was modernised and life extended, including new safety systems. In 2010 Novovoronezh-5 was shut down for modernization to extend its operating life for an additional 25 years, the first VVER-1000 to undergo such an operating life extension. The works include the modernization of management, protection and emergency systems, and improvement of security and radiation safety systems. As of 2018 unit 4 is undergoing modernisation work for a 15-year life extension, taking its operational life to 60 years. This involved annealing its reactor pressure vessel and using parts from the recently shutdown unit 3. == Reactor data == The Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant has five units: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
