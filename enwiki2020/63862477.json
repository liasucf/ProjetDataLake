    "text": "The gens Silvia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. According to legend, the Silvii were the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, Rome's mother city, and presumably came to Rome when that city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius in the seventh century BC. Notwithstanding their connection with Rome's foundation myths, the Silvii were plebeians, and hardly any members of this gens played a significant role in history.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 827 (\"Silvius\"). However, from inscriptions, several Silvii appear to have had distinguished military careers, and Silvius Silvanus was governor of Moesia Inferior in the time of Diocletian. ==Origin== Both Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus relate the tradition that the Silvii were descended from Silvius, the second king of Alba Longa, who was so called because he was born in the woods. His descendants took the \"cognomen\" Silvius, which was then passed down to his descendants until the time of Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus and Remus.Livy, i. 3.Dionysius, i. 70, 71.Cf. Plutarch, \"The Life of Romulus\", 3. Plutarch only alludes to the name, in mentioning \"Silvia\" as a name assigned to the mother of Romulus and Remus; but unlike Livy and Dionysius, he mentions his sources for the myths concerning their ancestry. When Alba was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, and its populus transferred to Rome, members of its leading families were enrolled in the Roman Senate, but the Silvii are not mentioned among them. Nowhere are Numitor's immediate successors named, nor is it stated whether they were descended from the Silvii; in the time of the war with Tullus Hostilius they were ruled by Gaius Cluilius, who died in the course of the war, and was replaced by a dictator, Mettius Fufetius. Unlike the Silvii, the Cluilii, presumably the royal house that succeeded them, are included in the list of Alban families accorded senatorial rank.Livy, i. 29, 30.Dionysius, iii. 29. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Silvii were Lucius, Gaius, and Quintus, which were among the most common names at all periods of Roman history. The inscriptions of this gens also afford examples of other common praenomina, including Marcus, Sextus, Publius, and Titus, as well as one instance of the rare praenomen Appius. ==Branches and cognomina== The nomenclature of Appius Silvius Junius Silanus would seem to indicate that he was a descendant of the noble house of the Junii Silani, though whether Silvius was his paternal nomen, or came in through his mother's side, is not readily apparent. ==Members== ===Silvian Dynasty=== * Silvius, the son, or brother, of Ascanius, was born in the woods, and raised by herdsmen in the mountains, according to Dionysius, who relates that he reigned for twenty-nine years. In Diodorus, he reigned for forty-nine years. In Ovid, his original name was Postumus, with Silvius being given him as an epithet. * Aeneas Silvius, the first to affix his father's name, Silvius to his own, to distinguish himself from his ancestor, reigned thirty-one years, according to Dionysius, and thirty in Diodorus; he is omitted by Ovid. * Latinus Silvius, established a number of colonies, later known as the Prisci Latini, or \"Old Latins\". Dionysius assigns him a reign of fifty-one years, Diodorus fifty. The latter adds that he was a martial king, who founded colonies to repopulate the region that he had destroyed by war. * Alba Silvius, reigned for thirty-nine years in Dionysius, thirty eight in Diodorus. He is omitted by Cassius Dio. * Atys (Silvius), called Capetus by Dionysius, Epitus by Diodorus, and Epytus by Ovid, reigned twenty-six years. * Capys Silvius, ruled over Alba for twenty- eight years. * Capetus (Silvius), called Calpetus by Diodorus, and in the Fasti, reigned thirteen years. He is omitted by Cassius Dio. * Tiberinus (Silvius), drowned in the river then known as the Albula, but subsequently called Tiber after him. Dionysius says that he reigned for eight years, and was slain in a battle near the Albula, his body being carried off by the river; Diodorus that he was swept away by the river while leading his army against the Etruscans. * Agrippa (Silvius), assigned a reign of forty-one years. In the Fasti, he is the father of Remulus, but in Metamorphoses, Ovid calls him \"Acrota\", and makes him the younger brother of Remulus, fierce, but less rash. * Romulus Silvius, struck by lightning. He is called Alladius by Dionysius, who makes him a terrible tyrant, contemptuous of the gods, who contrived to imitate thunder and lightning to intimidate his subjects; his death, after a reign of nineteen years, was thus an ironic punishment. Diodorus calls him Aramulius, and says that when thunder and lightning threatened the harvest, he bade his soldiers to beat upon their shields with their swords to drown out the noise, and thus he was struck down for his impiety. Ovid calls him Remulus, and mentions him rashly imitating lightning, but says nothing else of him except that he was killed by lightning, and succeeded by his younger brother. Cassius Dio relates his impiety, but says that he drowned when the Alban Lake overflowed. Both Dionysius and Diodorus mention that the ruins of his house could be seen beneath the waters of the Alban Lake. * Aventinus (Silvius), commemorated by a shrine on the Aventine Hill, reigned thirty-seven years. Diodorus relates that during a war, he and his army retreated to the Aventine as a redoubt. Cassius Dio states that he perished in war. Ovid describes the hill as his seat of power, and the site of his tomb\u2014perhaps implying that he was slain there, during the war alluded to by Diodorus and Cassius Dio. * Proca (Silvius), called Procas by Dionysius, and Palatinus by Ovid, ruled for twenty-three years, bequeathing his throne to his elder son, Numitor. Cassius Dio relates that in one account, Aventinus, not Proca, was the father of Numitor and Amulius. Ovid has Palatinus ruling from the Palatine Hill, as a parallel to his father, Aventinus. * Numitor (Silvius), the elder son of Proca, was deposed and exiled by his younger brother, his sons killed, and his daughter made a Vestal Virgin. * Amulius (Silvius), the younger son of Proca, deposed his brother, and attempted to extinguish his line; Dionysius relates that he ruled for forty-two years; Diodorus, forty-three. * Aegestus (Silvius), the son of Numitor, according to Dionysius and Cassius Dio, was ambushed and slain while on a hunt arranged by his uncle, Amulius. In Ovid, his name is Lausus. Livy does not name Numitor's sons, but refers to them in the plural. * Rhea Silvia, also called Ilia, the daughter of Numitor, was made a Vestal when her father was deposed; when violated, she gave birth to the twins Romulus and Remus, and named Mars as their father. Amulius threw her into prison, and ordered the boys thrown into the Tiber. * Antho (Silvia), the daughter of Amulius, pleaded with her father to spare the life of her cousin, Rhea Silvia. She is mentioned, but not named, by Dionysius, but named only in Plutarch.Livy, i. 3, 4.Dionysius, i. 70, 71, 76\u201379.Diodorus Siculus, vii. 5.Cassius Dio, i. 1\u20135.Plutarch, \"The Life of Romulus\", 3.Ovid, Fasti, iv. 19 ff., Metamorphoses, xiv. 609 ff. ===Historical Silvii=== * Silvia L. f.
