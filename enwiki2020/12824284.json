    "text": "William Ralston Murray Buchan (17 October 1914 \u2013 6 July 2003) was a Scottish professional football player and manager. He played for Celtic, Blackpool, Hull City, Gateshead, Coleraine and East Stirlingshire. Buchan signed professional forms with Celtic in 1933 and spent four years with the Glasgow club, winning the Scottish League Division One championship with them in 1935\u201336 and the Scottish Cup in 1937. In 1937, Buchan signed for Joe Smith's Blackpool for \u00a310,000,Buchan, Willie at TheCelticWiki then a record transfer fee involving a Scottish club, making his debut on 20 November 1937 in a 2\u20130 defeat at local rivals Preston North End. He scored his first goals for the club two games later, in a 2\u20132 draw at Middlesbrough on 4 December. He went on to score ten more goals in the 23 remaining games of the league season and, with his total twelve goals, finished joint-top scorer with Bobby Finan (see Blackpool F.C. season 1937\u201338). The following season, 1938\u201339, he finished joint-top scorer again, this time with new signing Jock Dodds, the pair scoring ten goals apiece. During the first of six seasons of inter-war football that followed, Buchan returned to Glasgow in an attempt to re-join Celtic, but the club showed little enthusiasm. He instead joined his local team, Stenhousemuir, as a guest player. When the club closed down for the duration of the war, Buchan returned to England to become a PT instructor in the Royal Air Force. Buchan made one appearance for Scotland in a wartime international. At the end of the war, Buchan returned to Blackpool. In Buchan's final season at the seaside, 1947\u201348, he made fourteen appearances in a start-stop season, his place in the line-up restricted due to the form of Stan Mortensen, Stanley Matthews and Ernie Taylor. His four goals game in two games: two in a 2\u20132 draw with Wolves on 6 September 1947, and two (one a penalty) in a 3\u20131 victory over Charlton Athletic at Bloomfield Road on 29 November. His final appearance for the club occurred on 1 May 1948, the final day of the league season, in a 7\u20130 demolition of Preston North End at Deepdale. Buchan joined Hull for the start of the 1948\u201349 campaign. In his only season with the club, he made forty league appearances, scoring twelve goals. In 1949, he joined Gateshead, with whom he made 88 league appearances and scored 16 goals. After a short spell as player-manager of Northern Irish club Coleraine, Buchan finished his career in his native Scotland with East Stirlingshire. Buchan died on 6 July 2003, aged 88. ==Honours== ;Celtic *Scottish League championship: 1935\u201336 *Scottish Cup winner: 1936\u201337 ;Hull City *Football League Third Division North championship: 1948\u201349 ==References== ;Specific ;General * * *Buchan's obituary (see 9 July) *Obituary in The Glasgow Herald, 10 July 2003 *Profile at SportHull.co.uk ==External links== *Pictures of Buchan Category:1914 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Scottish footballers Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Hull City A.F.C. players Category:Gateshead F.C. players Category:Coleraine F.C. players Category:East Stirlingshire F.C. players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Coleraine F.C. managers Category:People from Grangemouth Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Football League representative players Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Sportspeople from Falkirk (council area) Category:Scotland wartime international footballers ",
