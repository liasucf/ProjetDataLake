    "text": "CSU Ploie\u015fti was a Romanian professional basketball club, based in Ploie\u0219ti, Romania. The club competed in the Liga Na\u021bional\u0103, and was the most successful club of the 20th century, winning ten consecutive championships between 2004\u20132010 and 2012-2014 as well as six Romanian cups. In 2005, the team won the FIBA EuroCup Challenge. The club was known as CSU Asesoft for most of its existence for sponsorship reasons. ==History== Founded in 1998, Asesoft soon established itself as an emerging power with appearances in the Liga Na\u021bional\u0103 finals in 2001 and the semifinals in 2002 and 2003. Asesoft European debut came in the 2003\u201304 EuroChallenge. That season the team made history by beating Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti for its first Romanian League title. Asesoft then became the first and only Romanian team to win a European title, the 2005 FIBA EuroCup Challenge, edging Lokomotiv Kuban 74-75 in the title game at home with Vladimir Kuzmanovi\u0107 scoring 28 points, including game-winning free throws with 8 seconds left. Its first Eurocup experience came in 2007-08, when they beat Spirou Charleroi and eventual finalist CB Sant Josep, but did not get past the regular season. Back at home, however, Asesoft has been on a roll the entire decade, conquering seven straight Liga Na\u021bional\u0103 titles from 2004 until 2010. Last season in its Eurocup opener, Asesoft shocked Khimki Moscow 89-97 on the road, but finished the regular season with a 3-7 record. In the Liga Na\u021bional\u0103, the team won its third consecutive title after making full use of its home-court playoff advantage, winning the deciding Game 5`s of both the semifinal series against U Mobitelco Cluj, and in the finals against CSM Oradea. Back in the Eurocup, expect Asesoft to be even more competitive this season, especially in front of its fans.Asesoft in Europe; http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/, 23 October 2014 After the 2014\u201315 season, Asesoft Ploie\u0219ti was thrown back to the Romanian Second Division, because the team didn't have the finances to play in the highest league. However, the club did not play in the second league as the team disappeared. ==Trophies== ===Domestic competitions=== *Romanian League **Winners (11): 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 *Romanian Cup **Winners (6): 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 *Romanian Supercup **Winners (1): 2014 ===European competitions=== *EuroCup Challenge **Winners (1): 2004\u201305 ==Notable players== {| |- |valign=\"top\"| * Antonio Alexe * Virgil St\u0103nescu * Virgil C\u0103ru\u0163a\u015fu * C\u0103t\u0103lin Burlacu * Levente Szijarto * Vladimir Tica * Vladimir Kuzmanovi\u0107 * Vladimir Arnautovi\u0107 * Nikola Ili\u0107 * Bojan Obradovi\u0107 * Sa\u0161a Ocokolji\u0107 * Nikola Bulatovi\u0107 * Marius Runkauskas * Arvydas \u010cepulis |width=\"33\"| |valign=\"top\"| * Darius Hargrove * Chris Cooper * Jonte Flowers * Kevin Burleson * Reggie Elliot * Rashard Griffith * Dee Brown * Reggie Elliott * Alhaji Mohammed * Michalis Pelekanos * Gerald Lee * Ante Krapi\u0107 * Filip Adamovi\u0107 * Bozhidar Avramov |} ==External links== * Official website ==References== Category:Defunct basketball teams in Romania Category:Sport in Ploie\u0219ti Category:Basketball teams established in 1998 Category:Basketball teams disestablished in 2015 ",
