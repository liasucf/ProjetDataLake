    "text": "The Glacier Point Trailside Museum was one of the first projects in Yosemite National Park by Herbert Maier in what would become the National Park Service Rustic style. Located at Glacier Point, it was funded by Laura Spelman Rockefeller's estate as a project for the Yosemite Museum. It was the first \"trailside museum\" in the National Park system and was a prototype for enhanced visitor interpretation services in the parks. The museum is in reality a small stone shelter with arched openings on the north, east, and west sides. The roof is supported by log timbers. ==See also== *Architects of the National Park Service *National Register of Historic Places listings in Yosemite National Park *National Register of Historic Places listings in Mariposa County, California ==References== Category:Museums in Mariposa County, California Category:Natural history museums in California Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1924 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mariposa County, California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yosemite National Park Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Rustic architecture in California Category:Defunct museums in California Category:1924 establishments in California Category:National Park Service museums ",
