He studied at a Jesuit school in Bordeaux. From here, he moved to Paris, where after he became an atheist, he met Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, philosophers of the French age of Enlightenment. Protected by the Duke of Nivernais, he was appointed librarian of Philip, Duke of Parma.Elisabeth Badinter: Der Infant von Parma: Oder die Ohnmacht der Erziehung. C.H. Beck, M\u00fcnchen 2010, , p. 11. He worked in 1754 for the Journal des Savants. From November 1756 to March 1757 he worked for the '. This journal was published by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard, Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud (1721-1784), Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost and the lawyer Pierre-Jean-Baptiste Gerbier (1725-1788). He also wrote for the ' by Pierre Rousseau (1716-1785). During the French Revolution, he was sent to the National Convention as a member of Gironde, where he would address the issue of national education. He voted for the execution of Louis XVI. On 31 May 1793, the uprising of the Parisian sans-culottes, resulted in the arrest and execution of leading Girondins. Ultimately, this first attempt of the Jacobins to overthrow Robespierre and Jean-Paul Marat using the Parisian sans-culottes to overthrow the Girondins failed. It put an end to the reign of terror that ultimately took place with the popular uprising of 2 June 1793 and the adoption of the Constitution of 24 June 1793. Its peak was reached in June and in July 1794, also called \"Great Purge\", la grande terreur. Deleyre was able to elude arrest after 31 May. In addition to his works on philosophers, Deleyre contributed several articles, including \u00c9pingle and Fanatisme to the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and d'Alembert. In his Dictionnaire philosophique, Voltaire would make use of his article on fanaticism. == Main works == *1755: Analyse de la philosophie du chancelier Fran\u00e7ois Bacon ; *1758: Le G\u00e9nie de Montesquieu ; *1761: L'Esprit de Saint-\u00c9vremond ; *1761: Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages, ou Nouvelle collection de toutes les relations de voyages par mer et par terre, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9es:jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent dans les diff\u00e9rentes langues de toutes les nations connues ; (in collaboration with Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, \u00c9tienne-Maurice Chompr\u00e9 and Jacques-Nicolas Bellin, 1746\u20131789). *1777: Eloge de M.
