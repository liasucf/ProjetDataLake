Rawene started as a timber centre, with a mill and shipyardsMost shipbuilding in the Hokianga occurred at Kohukohu, New Zealand and Horeke established in the early 19th century. An attempted settlement by the first New Zealand Company in 1826 failed. Captain James Herd in 1822 had taken out the first shipment of kauri from the Hokianga in his ship Providence. In 1825 he returned as an agent for the Company, sailing the Rosanna in company with the Lambton, and 60 settlers between the two vessels. Starting at Stewart Island/Rakiura, Herd sailed up the east coast eventually rounding North Cape to enter Hokianga - his old stamping ground. Herd negotiated to buy a vast tract of land.The deed lies in National Archives in Wellington, with a photocopy held by the Hokianga Historical Society. The deal was contested but for decades Europeans referred to the town as \"Herd's Point\". Later it was called \"Hokianga Township\", and in 1884 it became \"Rawene\", possibly to identify the post office and telegraph. The post office had started operating by 1845 - one of eight in the country. Aperahama Taonui, chief of Te Popoto hap\u016b, allegedly operated a school at Rawene in the mid-19th century. James Reddy Clendon, previously the United States Consul to New Zealand, settled in Rawene in 1862 and served as the local magistrate under the Native Circuit Courts Act until 1867. His house still stands and is open to the public. By 1872 Rawene had two hotels and two stores. There was a Wesleyan church, and the Roman Catholics owned a section. Von Sturmer was the Postmaster, Customs Officer and Magistrate. During the Dog Tax War of 1898 the residents of Rawene left for Kohukohu or took refuge on a steamer after the tax rebels threatened to march on the town.Alfred Cooke Yarborough in Remember the Hokianga p 164 On 5 May 1898 120 men marched from Rawene to Waima to deal with the \"rebels\", but the dispute was settled without them. View of Rawene in 1918 A small cottage hospital was built on a hill overlooking the town in 1910. A new hospital was completed in 1928. Dr George McCall Smith headed the hospital from 1914 to 1948 and developed a unique health-system for the Hokianga. Dr Smith became a practitioner of \"painless childbirth\" in the early 1930s, using premedication with the barbiturate Nembutal combined with Hyoscine. This proved very popular and attracted women to Rawene from far afield. The annual average of thirty births per year now peaked at two hundred. In 1937 a \"Commission of Inquiry into Maternity Services\" investigated Smith's practice. Smith fronted up with case notes on his last two hundred patients, and his results could not be bettered anywhere.Parkes, pp 18-19 Parliament declared a special health area in the 1940s.Parliament gazetted the scheme on 1 September 1941 (NZ Gazette, 28 August 1941, p2702, but it lay in limbo until September 1945 before a \"trial period\" could begin. By 1947 the hospital boards in Northland were amalgamated but Hokianga retained its special area - it was finally official. This meant that all medical officers in the Hokianga were salaried, and all consultations, pharmaceuticals, investigations and hospital admissions were free. The whole scheme was funded through a per-capita grant.Parkes, pp 22-23 ==Education== Rawene School is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school has a roll of students as of A room for secondary students was added to Rawene Primary School in 1922. In 1947 a stand-alone Rawene District High School was built. It was extended in 1952, but was destroyed by fire in 1972. The Rawene Learning Centre is a campus of NorthTec polytechnic. ==Notable people== *Norm Maxwell, rugby union footballer and All Black. *Ron Guthrey, mayor of Christchurch (1968 to 1971). *Gordon Cochrane, WWII RNZAF bomber pilot. *Ren\u00e9 Shadbolt, nurse in Spanish Civil War, Hokianga hospital matron *George McCall Smith, doctor, medical superintendent, community leader ==References== ==External links== * *Rawene - Hokianga's Picturesque Port Town *rawene.nz * Category:Far North District Category:Hokianga Category:Populated places in the Northland Region ",
