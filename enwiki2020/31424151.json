Long Lake is now open, year-round, to watercraft with a 45 mph speed limit in open basins EXCEPT at night and in the morning, when the speed limit is 5 mph. (The 5 mph limit applies after 8 p.m. or official sunset, whichever comes first, to 11 a.m. in the morning.) * After sunset, all crafts must use proper running lights. * Crafts operating over 5 mph must be at least 200 feet off the shoreline. This must be observed because swimmers and nonmotorized craft tend to gather within the 200-foot safety zone. This rule also reduces the impact of wakes upon shore banks. * Crafts operating over 5 mph, including personal watercraft or \"jet skis,\" must also remain at least 100 feet away from all other craft and persons. * All watercraft must travel in a counter-clockwise direction. * Water skiing must be done in groups of at least three: a driver, an observer, and a skier. The observer is required to watch the skier at all times and to use a red or orange flag to signal when a skier is down in the water. All water skiers are required to wear an approved flotation device. * Personal flotation devices must be on-board all watercraft, with one device required for each person and easily accessible. Children 12 years old and younger must wear a personal flotation device at all times if traveling on a vessel that is shorter than 19 feet. * All personal watercraft (or \"jet ski\") operators must wear an approved flotation device. * It is illegal to operate any craft while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. ==Polar Bear Plunge== Each year on New Year's Day, Long Lake Park hosts the Polar Bear Plunge where hundreds ring in the new year by jumping into the lake.http://www.ci.lacey.wa.us/city-government/city-departments/parks-and- recreation/special-park-events/polar-bear-plunge (and quickly exiting) ==References== Category:Lakes of Washington (state) Category:Lakes of Thurston County, Washington Category:Tourist attractions in Thurston County, Washington ",
