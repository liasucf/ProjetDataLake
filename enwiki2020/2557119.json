    "text": "Arizona elegans is a species of medium-sized colubrid snake commonly referred to as the glossy snake or the faded snake,Schmidt, K.P., and D.D.Davis. 1941. Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 365 pp. (Arizona elegans, pp. 155-158, Figures 43. & 44\\. + Plate 17.) which is endemic to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It has several subspecies. Some have recommended that A. elegans occidentalis be granted full species status. == Subspecies == Subspecies of Arizona elegans include: * Arizona elegans arenicola Dixon, 1960 \u2014 Texas glossy snake * Arizona elegans candida Klauber, 1946 \u2014 Western Mojave glossy snake * Arizona elegans eburnata Klauber, 1946 \u2014 Desert glossy snake * Arizona elegans elegans Kennicott, 1859 \u2014 Kansas glossy snake * Arizona elegans expolita Klauber, 1946 \u2014 Chihuahua glossy snake * Arizona elegans noctivaga Klauber, 1946 \u2014 Arizona glossy snake * Arizona elegans occidentalis Blanchard, 1924 \u2014 California glossy snakeCaliforniaHerps.com: Arizona elegans occidentalis . accessed 8.28.2013 * Arizona elegans philipi Klauber, 1946 \u2014 Painted Desert glossy snake ==Description== The glossy snake and its many subspecies are all similar in appearance to gopher snakes. However, they are smaller than gopher snakes, with narrow, pointed heads, and a variety of skin patterns and colors. They appear \"washed-out\" or pale, hence the common name, \"faded snakes\".Conant, R. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. (paperback). (Arizona elegans, pp. 197-198 + Plate 27 + Map 145.) Most subspecies are ca. 75\u2013130 cm (ca. 30-50 inches) in total length. The maximum recorded total length for the species is 142 cm (56 in).Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (paperback). (Arizona elegans, pp. 182-183.) They are shades of tan, brown, and gray with spotted patterns on their smooth, glossy skin, and a white or cream-colored unmarked ventral surface. Coloration often varies in relation to the color of the soil in a snake's native habitat. ==Habitat== Range of Arizona elegans Habitat is normally semi-arid grasslands of the southwestern United States, from California in the west to Kansas in the east and as far south as Texas, and northern Mexico. ==Behavior and diet== They are nonvenomous, nocturnal predators of small lizards. They are also sometimes found in attics. ==Reproduction== Glossy snakes are oviparous. Adults breed in the late spring and early summer. Clutches average from 10 to 20 eggs. The eggs hatch in early summers and the newly hatched young are approximately in total length. ==References== ==Further reading== *Kennicott, R. in Baird, S.F. 1859.
