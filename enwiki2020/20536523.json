In its abbreviated second season, the series was switched to Thursday (by its sponsor) to fill the slot left by the cancelled 1920s situation comedy Margie starring Cynthia Pepper.1960-1961; 1961-1962 American network television schedules After The Law and Mr. Jones, Janet De Gore joined the revised cast of Walter Brennan's The Real McCoys, renamed The McCoys and switched from ABC to CBS. Conlan Carter took over the role of \"Doc\" on ABC's Combat! for which he secured an Emmy nomination in 1964. In 2000, James Whitmore said of the series, \"That thing arose out of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2026 This was right after the McCarthy thing was so hot in this country, and I thought it was time we did something about the right of people to disagree with one another in a reasonable fashion \u2026 That was the predication of that show, and I produced it \u2026 It was a wonderful experience.\" ABC had canceled the series after its first season, but thousands of angry letters from fans convinced them to bring the show back in 1962. Whitmore explained, \"We were taken off the air after one year, because I didn't want to do the commercials [for] Gleam Toothpaste. They wanted me as that character, that lawyer, to come on and say, 'You ought to use Gleam toothpaste,' and I didn't think I wanted to do that, so they dropped us. Procter and Gamble were our sponsors. Then, they had an astonishing hundreds of thousands of letters. It was engineered by some newspaper guys to get the show back on, and they brought it back on. I believe, if I'm not mistaken, the only time that had ever happened, with a TV show. I think it's happened since, but not at that point. We were brought back for one year.\"James Whitmore Interview 2000 ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (1960\u201361)=== ===Season 2 (1962)=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1960s American legal television series Category:1960 American television series debuts Category:1962 American television series endings Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:American drama television series Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Four Star Television Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:American television series revived after cancellation ",
