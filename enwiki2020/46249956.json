    "text": "Lactobacillus plantarum strain K21 is a gram-positive bacteria isolated from locally fermented vegetables. It has the ability to hydrolyze bile salt when it is provided as a supplement. K21 also reduces the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride, and inhibits the accumulation of lipid in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, it reduces the level of plasma leptin, mitigates liver damage and alleviates glucose intolerance. Finally K21 inhibits body weight gain and fat mass accumulation.WU, CC.; Weng, wl.; Lai, WL.; Tsai, HP.; Liu, WH.; Lee, MH.; Tsai, WC (February 2015). \"Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum Strain K21 on High-Fat Diet-Fed Obese Mice\".2015;2015:391767 ==References== Category:Lactobacillaceae ",
