With his hands he is connecting the wires from an electric battery, thereby making a magnet oscillate. At the foot of the statue sit the three Norns or goddesses of destiny in Norse mythology, Ur\u00f0r (the past) who is noting the past, and \u00d8rsted's name, on a tablet, Ver\u00f0andi (the present), who with her distaff is spinning the thread of fate, and Skuld (the future), who is silently awaiting the fullness of time with a rune stick in her hand. At the base of the statue sit the three Norse Norns or goddesses of fate Ur\u00f0r (the past), who is noting the past represented by \u00d8rsted's name on a tablet, Ver\u00f0andi (the present), who, with her distaff, is spinning the thread of fate, and Skuld (the future), who is silently awaiting the times that come with a runic stick in her hand. ==History== The H. C. \u00d8rsted Monument in 1876 The H. C. \u00d8rsted Monument photographed by Fritz Theodor Benzen in September 1902 The H. C. \u00d8rsted Monument photographed by Julius Aagaard The idea for the monument was conceived in early 1860 by Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann as mentioned by Hans Christian Andersen in Mit livs eventyr. A committee was set up but it would take 16 years before the monument was inaugurated. The committee consisted of the politician Frederik Ferdinand Tillisch, professor Johan Georg Forchhammer, Ole Berendt Suhr and Hans Christian Andersen. The committee had its first meeting on 2 October 1981. Jens Adolf Jerichau was given the task of designing the monument. Forchhammer died in 1865 and was replaced by J. C. Jacobsen in 1867. In 1873, they began to raise money for the bronze figures. They were cast in C. F. Holm's foundry at Gammel M\u00f8nt. It was erected on the former Holck's Bastion, when work on the park just started. The statue was finally inaugurated on 25 September 1876. ==See also== * List of public art in Copenhagen * List of public art in \u00d8rstedsparken ==References== ==External links== Category:Monuments and memorials in Copenhagen Category:Outdoor sculptures in Copenhagen Category:Statues in Copenhagen Category:Monuments and memorials to scientists ",
