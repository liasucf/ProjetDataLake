The election was won by William Sefton Moorhouse, who defeated former mayor Joseph Dransfield. ==Background== Prior conventions dictated that Wellington's mayors were chosen by the city councillors from amongst one of themselves. In December 1874 an election open to the voting public was held with the intention of ratepayers selecting who would occupy the office of mayor for the 1875 term. The election was held on 17 December and saw William Sefton Moorhouse defeat Joseph Dransfield by a 2 to 1 vote margin. ==Election results== The following table gives the election results: ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Mayoral elections in Wellington Category:1874 elections in New Zealand Category:Politics of the Wellington Region Category:1870s in Wellington ",
