It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Along with the adjacent cemetery, it is the only major surviving element of the Mount Salem community, which flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This building was constructed by the community in 1909\u201310, and was the third building on the site. All of them served as both a church and local school. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Logan County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Logan County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1910 Category:Buildings and structures in Logan County, Arkansas ",
