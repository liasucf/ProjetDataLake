After studies in Pavia and Berlin, he assumed a professorship in Perugia in 1900 and later in Genoa, which he left for Pavia in 1917 and finally Milan's Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in 1924. His principal works include the civil law textbook Istituzioni di diritto civile (1924), used by generations of Italian students, and Il contratto di lavoro nel diritto civile italiano (1901), which established the scientific discipline of labour law in Italy. ==References== * Category:Italian jurists Category:University of Pavia alumni Category:University of Perugia faculty Category:1873 births Category:1956 deaths Category:20th-century jurists ",
