    "text": "Analord is a series of eleven 12\" vinyl records released in 2005 by UK-based electronic music artist Richard D. James, primarily under the alias AFX. The series marked James's return to primarily analogue equipment following his computer-oriented programming work in the late 1990s. After their release, James \"distilled\" the 3\u00bd hour, 42-track series into the 10-track compilation album Chosen Lords (2006), effectively his first full-length release since the 2001 album Drukqs. On 24 December 2009, the Rephlex Records website began posting unreleased/bonus tracks for the Analord series in MP3 and WAV digital formats. In all, 21 bonus tracks were added to the series, totalling 62 tracks for a runtime of 4 hours and 36 minutes.Analord, www.discogs.com, Retrieved 2015-07-11 ==History== The first installment, Analord 10, went on sale through the Rephlex Records website on 15 December 2004, and was packaged in a faux- leather binder with sleeves for housing the rest of the series. It was later re-released as a picture disc. Both pressings of Analord 10 were marketed under James' primary alias Aphex Twin, although other Analord recordings were released under the AFX pseudonym.Aphex Twin Interview, www.clashmusic.com, Retrieved 2015-07-11A beginner's guide to the many sounds of Aphex Twin, www.avclub.com, Retrieved 2015-07-11 A condensed, album-length version of the series, Chosen Lords was released in 2006. ==Musical equipment used== James has programmed a variety of analogue equipment throughout his career. Instruments on Analord include drum machines such as the Roland TR-606, TR-808, and TR-909; sequencers such as the Roland MC-4; and various synthesizers and polysynths, including the Roland SH-101 and Roland TB-303, a Synton Fenix Modular ==Etymology== The name refers to the analogue and digital electronic music equipment James used to perform much of Analord, as well as being a double entendre. Since James has a penchant for anagrams, it is noteworthy that \"Analord\" is an anagram for \"A Roland\", perhaps referencing a well-known manufacturer of analogue synthesizers. It has also been speculated that the term \"Analord\" is a portmanteau of the words analogue and lord, referring to Richard James' previous analogue programming, and the talent and recognition he has in his industry. \"Analord\" is also the title of a Luke Vibert track from Lover's Acid on Planet Mu. ==Allusions== *Tracks on Analord 8, Analord 9, and Analord 11 are named after computer viruses and other malicious software, allegedly to prevent or discourage file sharing. *The images on both sides of Analord 11 feature the Michael Faraday Memorial in Elephant and Castle, London (which is near the disused bank Richard D. James owns). * Both sides of Analord 1 feature the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer as the label art. * Side B of \"Analord 04\" has an Halibut's eye as the label art, connecting with the track \"Halibut Acid\". ==Track listing== ===Analord 1=== Released 24 January 2005. ===Analord 2=== Released 24 January 2005. ===Analord 3=== Released 21 February 2005. ===Analord 4=== Released 21 February 2005. ===Analord 5=== Released 14 March 2005. ===Analord 6=== Released 11 April 2005. ===Analord 7=== Released 25 April 2005. ===Analord 8=== Released 9 May 2005. ===Analord 9=== Released 13 June 2005. ===Analord 10=== Released 15 December 2004, Re-released as a picture disc on 11 July 2005. ===Analord 11=== Released 13 June 2005. * Released on 24 December 2009, only available through download. ==References== ==External links== * Rephlex Analord webpage & Rephlex Analord 10 webpage * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Acid techno albums Category:2005 EPs Category:Aphex Twin albums Category:Rephlex Records EPs Category:EP series ",
