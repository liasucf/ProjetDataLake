The peninsula ends at Dennis Head, the site of an early Celtic fortress.Genuki website Later it served as a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War, and provided a lookout point for the Home Guard during the Second World War. The parish is divided by the tidal Gillan Creek. The hamlet and parish church are on the north side of the creek. On the south side are the hamlets of Carne, Flushing (not to be confused with the larger village of Flushing north of Falmouth) and Gillan, and further inland the small ancient settlements of Boden and Trewarnevas. The South West Coast Path runs along both shores of Gillan Creek and crosses it on stepping stones only passable at low tide. The path then rounds Dennis Head and leaves the parish on the south shore of the Helford River. St Anthony-in-Meneage lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). ==Parish church== The parish church is dedicated to St Anthony and is situated near the shore. It is medieval though parts are of different dates, a window in the chancel (Early English) is the earliest and the north aisle with an arcade of plain octagonal piers somewhat later. The tower was built in the 15th century of granite blocks at the west end. The font is ornamented with angels and a Latin inscription and is probably of the 15th century.Pevsner, N.

The Member of Parliament for West Cornwall, Arthur Pendarves Vivian MP bought the estate at an auction (reserve price \u00a324,000) in 1882, when the estate was described as having a \u2033fine residential mansion\u2033. Also included in the sale were the three farms of Halvose, Passage and Treath (about ) as well as some fishing and ferry rights on the River Hal. At the time of the auction the estate covered in the parishes of St Anthony, Manaccan and Constantine, and was originally developed by the Grylls family. The 1884 house was demolished in the 1950s and replaced by a smaller house.Matthew Beckett Bosahan ; England's Lost Country HousesOrdnance Survey One-inch Map of Great Britain; Truro and Falmouth, sheet 190. 1961Bosahan Lodge, Gate Piers, Gates and Flanking Walls; British Listed Buildings In 1909, The Gardeners' magazine described the garden which had been developed over the previous 25 years, as \u2033the most Cornish of all Cornish gardens\u2033.
