    "text": "In grammar, the instructive case is a grammatical case used in the Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish languages. == Finnish == In the Finnish language, the instructive case has the basic meaning of \"by means of\". It is a comparatively rarely used case, though it is found in some commonly used expressions, such as omin silmin \u2192 \"with one's own eyes\". In modern Finnish, many of its instrumental uses are being superseded by the adessive case, as in \"min\u00e4 matkustin junalla\" \u2192 \"I travelled by train.\" It is also used with Finnish verbal second infinitives to mean \"by ...ing\", e.g. \"lent\u00e4en\" \u2192 \"by flying\", \"by air\" (\"lent\u00e4\u00e4\" = \"to fly\"). == Estonian == In Estonian, the instructive case (Estonian: viisi\u00fctlev) also exists, but only in some words. (f.e: \"jalgsi\" - \"on foot\", from \"jalg\" - foot) == Turkish == In Turkish, the suffix -le is used for this purpose. Ex: Trenle geldim \"I came via train\". ==Further reading== * * Category:Grammatical cases ",
