He was President of the Nova Scotia Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Halifax Chamber of Commerce. He was also a Director of the Bank of Canada and the Industrial Development Bank. He was a member of the Board of Governors of Dalhousie University and chairman of its budget committee.

In the early 80s, Barrow and two other individuals were charged with criminal offences in relation to fund-raising activities on behalf of the Nova Scotia Liberal Association. In May 1983, following a jury trial in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Barrow was found guilty and fined $25,000. He appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, which dismissed the appeal in September 1984. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that the jury selection process had been contrary to the requirements of the Criminal Code. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial.R. v.
