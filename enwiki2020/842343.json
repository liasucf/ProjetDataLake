He previously played eight seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Phoenix Coyotes and Philadelphia Flyers. ==Playing career== Esche started his career with the Phoenix Coyotes, only to be traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in a deal involving Michal Handzu\u0161 and Brian Boucher. In 2004, he claimed the starting goaltending spot for the Flyers, and led them to the Eastern Conference Finals, only to fall in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning. While playing in Russia for Ak Bars Kazan, he posted a record of 22\u20135\u20132 with a 2.01 goals against average (GAA) and a .912 save percentage, along with four shutouts.

He played one game in the Olympic tournament, losing 5\u20134 to Russia. Esche played for the 2008 Team USA Hockey team in the World Championships which took place in Canada.

He also posted a 9\u20131 victory against Norway. ==Personal== Esche has two children with former wife Kelly. He hails from Whitesboro, New York.
