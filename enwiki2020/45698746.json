On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 27%, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Captive undermines committed performances from Kate Mara and David Oyelowo \u2013 and the real-life story they're dramatizing \u2013 with a thin script doubling as an ad for a self-help book.\" James Rocchi of The Wrap called it \"A Lifetime movie shoved into a cage and fattened with sermons and platitudes until it is ready to be served up cold and bland.\" But Linda Cook of the Quad City Times called it \"a top-notch, captivating film.\" Michael Foust of The Christian Post labeled it \"one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen\" and added it was \"not the typical Christian movie.\" Foust wrote, \"I suspect the movie ... succeeds because we can see a bit of ourselves in Smith or even Oyelowo, two broken people whose lives intersect on a tragic day in which the power of God's Word triumphed.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 36 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". ==Inaccuracies== In the film, Nichols is depicted shooting Judge Barnes from the front when in real life, Nichols snuck into the courtroom from the back and shot Barnes from behind. He is also shown killing Deputy Teasley inside the courthouse, when Nichols actually killed Teasley after he ran outside. Also, Nichols shot Teasley five times, while in the movie, he shoots him only twice. Nichols took four hostages before the killings but in the film, he doesn't take any hostages aside from Smith. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:2015 crime drama films Category:2015 crime thriller films Category:2010s prison films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American thriller drama films Category:Biographical films about criminals Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about domestic violence Category:Films about rape Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about Christianity Category:Films about religion Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films directed by Jerry Jameson Category:Films scored by Lorne Balfe Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films set in 2005 Category:Films set in the 21st century Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:Films about hostage takings Category:American prison drama films Category:Thriller films based on actual events Category:2015 drama films ",
