    "text": "Loveresse is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Loveresse is first mentioned in 1148 as de Loveresce though this document is probably a late 12th-century forgery. In 1225 it was mentioned as Loverasse. In the 12th century both Bellelay Abbey and the college of canons of Moutier-Grandval Abbey owned lands or rights in Loveresse. During the second half of the 13th century, Bellelay Abbey expanded their holdings in the village and became the main landowner there. In 1404 the Prince-Bishop of Basel granted extensive rights to Loveresse in a bid to attract settlers. The village church was part of the parish of Tavannes- Chaindon. When the parish converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, Loveresse also converted. It remained part of the parish until 1928 when it joined the Reconvilier parish. By the beginning of the Early Modern era, the village was owned by the provost of Moutier-Grandval. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Loveresse became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Loveresse was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. In the late 19th century, several watch manufactures established shops in Loveresse. However, none of them survived the worldwide Great Depression. In 1906 the Canton of Bern purchased the hospice in the Vall\u00e9e de Tavannes. It was converted into a girls' boarding school. In 1975 the building was converted into a clinic for the Bellelay region, and it was used in that capacity until 1987. After 1987 it was used as an agricultural training school, the Centre de formation et de vulgarisation agricole du Bernese Jura. ==Geography== Moron mountain and the surrounding villages, including Loveresse in the center under the cliff face.
