The base was established in 1967 on the site of a former French rubber plantation and was located approximately 6 km east of An L\u1ed9c in B\u00ecnh Long Province. The 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division comprising: *1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment *1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment *1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment was based at Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i from March 1968 until August 1969. The 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry was based at Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i in April 1969. In July 1969 the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment moved to Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i and would remain here until September 1969. The regiment would be based here again from December 1969 to July 1970, during which time it participated in the Cambodian Incursion. In February 1970 the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division comprising: *1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry *1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry *2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry *1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry *1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry moved to Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i and would stay here until August 1970. The 3rd Brigade would participate in the Cambodian Inursion. Other units stationed at Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i included: *Battery F, 16th Artillery (October 1969-January 1970) *1st Battalion, 21st Artillery (1967-1968) *6th Battalion, 27th Artillery (January 1968-March 1970) *1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry ** Bravo Troop ===1972-5=== The ARVN took over the base and at the start of the Battle of An L\u1ed9c in April 1972 it was defended by a battalion of the 7th Regiment, 5th Division and was also the base for the 9th Regiment. A combined 105mm and 155mm artillery battery was also based at Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i. On the evening of 7 April elements of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 9th Division overran Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i, the 7th Regiment was ordered to destroy their heavy equipment and fall back to An L\u1ed9c. Once captured the PAVN used Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i as a staging base for units coming in from Cambodia to join the siege of An L\u1ed9c and key members of COSVN were based there to oversee the battle. On 8 August the ARVN 18th Division launched an assault to retake Qu\u1ea7n L\u1ee3i but were stopped by the PAVN in the base's reinforced concrete bunkers. A further attack was launched on 9 August with limited gains and attacks on the base continued for the next 2 weeks eventually gaining one third of the base. The ARVN finally attacked the PAVN occupied bunkers with TOW missiles and M-202 rockets and this broke the PAVN defense forcing the remaining defenders to flee the base. ==Current use== The base is largely overgrown but a small area appears to remain in use by the PAVN. ==References== ==External links== *6/27th Artillery homepage *Modern photos and video of the area *Quan Loi base camp photo tour Category:Installations of the United States Army in South Vietnam Category:Installations of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Category:Military installations closed in the 1970s Category:Buildings and structures in B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Province ",
