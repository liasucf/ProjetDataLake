    "text": "\"Love in the Time of Hydra\" is the fourteenth episode of the second season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with Skye's new abilities, while Lance Hunter learns of a new S.H.I.E.L.D. faction, and Grant Ward reappears with the unpredictable Agent 33. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Brent Fletcher, and directed by Jesse Bochco. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki. Maya Stojan guest stars Agent 33, while recurring guest star Edward James Olmos is introduced. \"Love in the Time of Hydra\" originally aired on ABC on March 24, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 4.29 million viewers. ==Plot== Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent 33 was brainwashed by Hydra leader Daniel Whitehall, electrocuted while wearing a nanomask that disguised her as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Melinda May, and now permanently looks like May, but with a large scar and distorted voice. When Whitehall was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Phil Coulson, Agent 33 ran away with former Hydra agent and S.H.I.E.L.D. mole, but now free agent, Grant Ward. The two of them kidnap the inventor of the nanomask, who does his best to repair 33\u2019s, leaving her with the ability to either turn off the mask, or transform it into the appearance of anyone she sees, though turning it off means revealing the scar, and turning it on gives her May\u2019s voice. Using this technology, 33 and Ward infiltrate the US air force base of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot and break out former high ranking Hydra operative Sunil Bakshi, who had captured 33 for Whitehall originally. Agent Mack introduces Lance Hunter to the leaders of \u201cthe real S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d, an organization formed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who mistrusted former director Nick Fury\u2019s secrets, and who fear the potential harm caused by Coulson being resurrected by Fury using alien DNA, and Agent Skye having developed incredible abilities thanks to contact with an alien substance. They don\u2019t want Coulson, whose behaviour they call \u201ctroubling\u201d since his resurrection, to be in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hunter\u2019s ex-wife, Agent Bobbi Morse, agrees that Coulson \u201chas been compromised\u201d. Morse later attempts to apologize to Hunter for not telling him about the other S.H.I.E.L.D., as they had recently been rekindling their relationship, and then allows him to escape. Agent Anne Weaver calculates that it will take Hunter 12 hours to reach land from the aircraft carrier that serves as their base, and Morse says that it will take only 6 hours for her to take Coulson\u2019s base. Unaware of everything that is happening, Coulson takes Skye to a safe house after May admits that Skye should be removed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson gives Skye a pair of gloves designed by Agent Jemma Simmons that are intended to negate her abilities, which create earthquakes. Coulson explains to her that though she may have new powers, she is still the same person to him. He then returns to S.H.I.E.L.D., leaving Skye to adjust to her new status quo. In an end tag, 33 and Ward learn of her past, including that her name is Kara, before brainwashing Bakshi themselves. ==Production== ===Development=== In March 2015, Marvel announced that the fourteenth episode of the season would be titled \"Love in the Time of Hydra\", to be written by Brent Fletcher, with Jesse Bochco directing. ===Casting=== In March 2015, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, and Bobbi Morse, respectively.
