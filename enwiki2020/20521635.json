Ranavirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Iridoviridae. There are five other genera of viruses within the family Iridoviridae, but Ranavirus is the only one that includes viruses that are infectious to amphibians and reptiles. Additionally, it is one of the three genera within this family which infect teleost fishes, along with Lymphocystivirus and Megalocytivirus. The family Iridoviridae is one of the five families of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. ==Ecological impact== The Ranaviruses, like the Megalocytiviruses, are an emerging group of closely related dsDNA viruses which cause systemic infections in a wide variety of wild and cultured fresh and saltwater fishes. As with Megalocytiviruses, Ranavirus outbreaks are therefore of considerable economic importance in aquaculture, as epizootics can result in moderate fish loss or mass mortality events of cultured fishes. Unlike Megalocytiviruses, however, Ranavirus infections in amphibians have been implicated as a contributing factor in the global decline of amphibian populations. The impact of Ranaviruses on amphibian populations has been compared to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causative agent of chytridiomycosis. In the UK, the severity of disease outbreaks is thought to have increased due to climate change. ==Etymology== Rana is derived from the Latin for \"frog\", reflecting the first isolation of a Ranavirus in 1960s from the Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens). ==Evolution== VOA report about Ranavirus The ranaviruses appear to have evolved from a fish virus which subsequently infected amphibians and reptiles. ==Hosts== ===Anuran Hosts=== *Wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) *American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbieanus) *Pickerel Frog ===Urodelan Hosts=== ===Reptilian Hosts=== *Green pythons (Chondropython viridis) *Burmese star tortoises (Geochelone platynota) *Leopard tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) *Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) *Mountain lizard (Lacerta monticola) *Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) *Florida box turtles (Terrapene carolina bauri) *Western ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata) *Spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca)Blahak S., Uhlenbrok C. \"Ranavirus infections in European terrestrial tortoises in Germany\".

The genus Ranavirus is composed of 6 recognized viral species, 3 of which are known to infect amphibians (Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), Bohle iridovirus (BIV), and frog virus 3). ==Structure== Ranaviruses are large icosahedral DNA viruses measuring approximately 150 nm in diameter with a large single linear dsDNA genome of roughly 105 kbpWilliams T, Barbosa-Solomieu V, Chinchar GD (2005). \"A decade of advances in iridovirus research\" 173-148.

The main structural component of the protein capsid is the major capsid protein (MCP). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !!

Replication of FV3 occurs between 12 and 32 degrees Celsius. Ranaviruses enter the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Viral particles are uncoated and subsequently move into the cell nucleus, where viral DNA replication begins via a virally encoded DNA polymerase. Viral DNA then abandons the cell nucleus and begins the second stage of DNA replication in the cytoplasm, ultimately forming DNA concatemers. The viral DNA is then packaged via a headful mechanism into infectious virions.Chinchar VG, Essbauer S, He JG, Hyatt A, Miyazaki T, Seligy V, Williams T (2005). \"Family Iridoviridae\" pp. 145\u2013162 in Fauquet CM, Mayo MA, Maniloff J, Desselburger U, Ball LA (eds). Virus Taxonomy, Eighth report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Academic Press, San Diego, USA. The ranavirus genome, like other iridoviral genomes is circularly permuted and exhibits terminally redundant DNA. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !!

Ranaviruses are relatively stable in aquatic environments, persisting several weeks or longer outside a host organism. ==Epizoology== Amphibian mass mortality events due to Ranavirus have been reported in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Ranaviruses have been isolated from wild populations of amphibians in Australia, but have not been associated with mass mortality on that continent. ==Pathogenesis== Synthesis of viral proteins begins within hours of viral entry with necrosis or apoptosis occurring as early as a few hours post- infection. ==Gross pathology== Gross lesions associated with Ranavirus infection include erythema, generalized swelling, hemorrhage, limb swelling, and swollen and friable livers. ==See also== *Decline in amphibian populations ==References== ==External links== * ICTV Online (10th) Report: Iridoviridae * Viralzone: Ranavirus * Ranavirus Research Project * Viral Diseases of Amphibians * More information on Ranavirus and other pathogens impacting amphibian populations, including Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans can be found at the Southeast Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation disease task team web-page.
