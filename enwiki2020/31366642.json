Material from this album originally formed the basis of a CD-R, which was distributed by Akron/Family in the months prior to the release of their self-titled first album on Young God Records. The songs were later remastered by Doug Henderson at the Brooklyn-based studio Micro Moose, and sold in an elaborately packaged edition of 500 copies. ==Track listing== ;Disc 1: Trout #\"Dirt Road Cloud of Light\" \u2013 4:25 #\"Rainbow Trout\" \u2013 4:37 #\"No Dada for You Baba\" \u2013 4:14 #\"Song for Chris and Ed\" - 2:42 #\"Always Gone\" \u2013 3:58 #\"It's So Hard\" \u2013 3:20 #\"Sparks\" \u2013 3:32 #\"Meek Warrior\" \u2013 2:01 #\"Ground\" - 6:02 #\"Beard Rock\" - 1:35 #\"Responsible for the Weather\" - 4:29 #\"The Only Home\" - 1:36 #\"Noah\" - 3:28 #\"Dream Girl\" - 2:06 #\"Top of the Mountain\" - 5:52 #\"The Littlest Horse\" - 1:37 ;Disc 2: Sun #\"As It Was in the Beginning, Is Now\" - 3:14 #\"Sun Comes Up\" - 5:27 #\"Space/Love --> Space is Love\" - 5:52 #\"Lord Open My Heart\" - 3:04 #\"Sunspots\" - 3:50 #\"No Space in This Realm\" - 5:00 #\"Come to Terms (With What's Going On)\" - 5:21 #\"Blessing Force\" - 2:15 #\"Where the Grass Tells Me\" - 4:25 #\"If On the Path\" - 5:23 #\"What Point Was Come\" - 3:30 #\"Space/Love\" - 2:31 #\"I Once Was As It Was\" - 2:17 ;Disc 3: Sparrow #\"World of Difference\" - 2:37 #\"Death Sparrow Blues\" - 6:31 #\"I've Had Enough\" - 3:28 #\"Sofie\" - 5:27 #\"Finland, Masked in Lupins\" - 5:59 #\"Saddest Turtle\" - 0:42 #\"Don't Seem Right\" - 3:29 #\"Ali, Ali\" - 2:25 #\"Rinpoche Said\" - 3:27 #\"Ghost of Katie\" - 6:15 #\"And Everything\" - 3:12 #\"Sun Goes Down\" - 2:17 #\"On the Battlefield/Authentic Man\" - 9:39 == References == Category:2007 albums Category:Akron/Family albums Category:Albums produced by Doug Henderson (musician) ",
