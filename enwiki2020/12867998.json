    "text": "Georges Neveux (1900-1982) was a French dramatist and poet. Neveux's first notable work was the play Juliette ou la cl\u00e9 des songes (Juliet or the key to dreams), written in 1927 and produced in 1930. It became the basis of Theodor Schaefer's 1934 melodrama Julie aneb Snar (Julie or the Book of Dreams) for piano, jazz instruments, and small orchestra; for Bohuslav Martin\u016f's 1937 opera Julietta, and for the 1951 film Juliette, or Key of Dreams. During the 1930s, when he was general secretary of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he wrote little. In 1943 there appeared Le Voyage de Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (The Voyage of Theseus), which was also later adapted by Martin\u016f as an opera (Ariane, 1958). In 1945 he translated and adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Neveux also wrote numerous filmscripts, although he greatly preferred the theatre. As he said: 'the first because one must earn a living, the second because one must deserve to live'. In 1982 he was awarded the Grand Prix du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise . == Selected filmography== * The Devil's Holiday (1931) * Narcotics (1932) * The Decoy (1935) * The Devil in the Bottle (1935) * The Beautiful Adventure (1942) * Dr. Knock (1951) * The Lovers of Midnight (1953) * The Count of Monte Cristo (1954) * The Little Czar (1954) * The New Adventures of Vidocq (1971, TV series) ==Bibliography== *Germaine Bree, Georges Neveux: A Theatre of Adventure, in Yale French Studies, vol.
