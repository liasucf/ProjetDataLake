The earliest railways, beginning with the Tranent to Cockenzie Waggonway in 1722, had wooden rails, and several lines had been built by the time the first cast-iron rails were produced in 1767. Many of the later waggonways were built to the Scotch gauge of 4 ft 6 in (1,372 mm), and were subsequently converted to standard-gauge steam railways. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |- ! width=\"15%\"|Name of Line ! width=\"7%\"|Opened ! width=\"38%\"|Route ! width=\"28%\"|Notes |- | Alloa Waggonway | 1768 | Collyland & Alloa Pits to Alloa glassworks | |- | Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway | 1831 | Kilwinning collieries to Ardrossan Harbour | Merged with the Glasgow and South Western Railway |- | Auchincruive Waggonway | c.1784 | Newton-on-Ayr to Annbank | Abandoned |- | Bainsford waggonway | 1810 | Carron Works to the Forth & Clyde Canal at Burnhouse BasinFalkirk Herald 18 Oct 2014: Bainsford \u2013 Not \u2018Brian\u2019s Ford\u2019 or \u2018Bairn\u2019s Ford\u2019 | |- | Ballochney Railway | 1828 | Arden Colliery, Ballochney to Kipps (connection with Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway) | Merged into Monkland Railways |- | Brora colliery tramway | 1770 | Brora colliery to Brora Salt Works, Sutherland | |- | Calderbank | c.1797 | Calderbank Ironworks to Monkland Canal | |- | Carron Railway | c.1766 | Kinnaird & Carronhall collieries to Carron Works | |- | Craigie Waggonway | c.1855 | Craigie Pits to Ayr | Lifted after 1865 |- | Drumpeller Railway | 1847 | Bankhead collieries to Monkland Canal at Cuilhill Gullet | |- | Dundee and Newtyle Railway | 1831 | Newtyle to Dundee | Taken over by the Dundee and Perth Railway |- | Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway | 1831 | Dalkeith to Edinburgh (St Leonards) & Fisherrow Harbour, Musselburgh | Sold to the North British Railway |- | Edmonstone Railway (or Newton Railway) | 1818 | Newton Colliery to Little France, EdinburghHistory of the railways of Edinburgh: The Waggonways Arrive | |- | Elgin Wagonway | c.1773 | Berrylaw pits (west of Dunfermline) to the coast at Limekilns and Charlestown, Fife | Developed as the Dunfermline and Charlestown Railway |- | Fairlie Mains | 1818 | Peatland coalworks to Kilmarnock and Troon Railway at Drybridge | |- | Fordell Railway | c.1752 | Fordell Collieries to St Davids Harbour, Inverkeithing Bay | |- | Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway | 1831 | Gartsherrie (Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway junction) to Garnkirk and Glasgow | Merged into Monkland Railways |- | Govan Railway | 1775-78 | Govan Colliery to Wherry Wharf, Windmillcroft Quay, Glasgow | Extended as Polloc and Govan Railway |- | Halbeath Railway | 1783 | Halbeath Colliery to Inverkeithing Harbour | |- | Hurlet Waggonway | 1820 | Hurlet Coal & Limeworks to Glasgow, Paisley & Ardrossan Canal at Rosshall quay, Paisley | |- | Irvine Colliery | c.1836 | Irvine Colliery to Irvine Harbour | |- | Kilmarnock and Troon Railway | 1812 | Kilmarnock to Troon harbour | |- | Knightswood Waggonway | c.1750 | Woodside Colliery, Knightswood to River Clyde at Yoker | |- | Legbrannock Waggonway | 1800 | Legbrannock collieries to eastern end of Monkland Canal at Calderbank | |- | Marquis of Lothian's waggonway | 1832 | Coal pits at Arniston Engine to Dalhousie (connection with Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway ) | Sold to North British Railway |- | Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway | 1826 | Palacecraig & Kipps collieries to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Kirkintilloch, plus branches | |- | Newbigging Limeworks | c.1817 | Newbigging Limestone Mine to Carron Harbour, FifeShale Oil: Newbigging No.1 & 2 mines | |- | Newton-upon-Ayr | c.1775 | Newton-upon-Ayr pits to Ayr harbour | |- | Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway | 1837 | Newtyle (junction with Dundee and Newtyle Railway) to Coupar Angus | Taken over by the Scottish Midland Junction Railway |- | Newtyle and Glammis Railway | 1838 | Newtyle (junction with Dundee and Newtyle Railway) to Glamis | Taken over by the Scottish Midland Junction Railway |- | Omoa Waggonway | 1813 | Newarthill collieries to Omoa Ironworks, Cleland, North Lanarkshire | |- | Paisley and Renfrew Railway | 1837 | Paisley to Renfrew Wharf on the River Clyde | Sold to the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway in 1847 |- | Pinkie Railway (Hopes Railway) | 1815 | Pinkie Hill pits to Musselburgh & Fisherrow Harbour | |- | Polloc and Govan Railway | 1840 | Rutherglen to Broomielaw Harbour, Glasgow | |- | Ravenscraig and Jameston Railway | ?
