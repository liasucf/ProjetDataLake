Young commented at the time \"I think it's going to have a connection to that nostalgic feeling for 'Looney Tunes,' that old animated flavor where everything wasn't squeaky clean, you know? Daffy Duck would get his bill blasted off with double barrel shotguns... That's what I grew up watching, and being able to play around with that in this hyper-superhero intergalactic universe will be a lot of fun.\" \"Rocket Raccoon Spins Off 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' Into Solo Comic Series\", MTV News. 27 Feb 2014.
