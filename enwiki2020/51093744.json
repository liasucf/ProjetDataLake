    "text": "Phil Healy (born 19 November 1994) is an Irish athlete competing in sprinting events. Her sister Joan Healy is also a sprinter. She set an Irish 200m national record in July 2018. In the 2018 European Championships, she placed fourth with a time of 23.23. A video of Phil Healy winning the final leg of the 4 x 400 metre Irish University Championships in 2016 went viral around the world. Her winning run is often cited as one of the greatest athletics comebacks of all time. As she approaches the finishing line, having closed an 80-metre gap with the lead runners, the TV commentator is heard to shout \"UCC from the depths of hell are powering through\". ==International competitions== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=2|2013 |rowspan=2|European Junior Championships |rowspan=2|Rieti, Italy |4th |100 m |11.96 |- |14th (h) |200 m |24.44 |- |rowspan=2|2014 |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland |26th (h) |100 m |11.53 |- |10th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |43.84 |- |rowspan=4|2015 |rowspan=2|IAAF World Relays |rowspan=2|Nassau, Bahamas |17th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |45.38 |- |5th |4 \u00d7 200 m relay |1:36.90 |- |rowspan=2|European U23 Championships |rowspan=2|Tallinn, Estonia |12th (h) |100 m |11.81 |- |5th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |44.681 |- |rowspan=2|2016 |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Amsterdam, Netherlands |12th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |44.29 |- |15th (h) |4 \u00d7 400 m relay |3:34.02 |- |rowspan=3|2017 |rowspan=2|European Indoor Championships |rowspan=2|Belgrade, Serbia |14th (sf) |60 m |7.40 |- |26th (h) |400 m |54.80 |- |Universiade |Taipei, Taiwan |7th |200 m |23.81 |- |rowspan=4|2018 |World Indoor Championships |Birmingham, United Kingdom |12th (sf) |400 m |53.26 |- |rowspan=3|European Championships |rowspan=3|Berlin, Germany |20th (sf) |100 m |11.46 |- |11th (sf) |200 m |23.23 |- |9th (h) |4 \u00d7 100 m relay |43.80 |- |rowspan=3|2019 |European Indoor Championships |Glasgow, United Kingdom |15th (sf) |400 m |53.65 |- |Universiade |Naples, Italy |6th |200 m |23.44 |- |World Championships |Doha, Qatar |37th (h) |200 m |23.56 |} 1Did not finish in the final ==Personal bests== Outdoor *100 metres \u2013 11.28 (+2.0 m/s, Dublin 2018, National Record - NR) https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/arid-30847446.html *200 metres \u2013 22.99 (0.0 m/s, Cork 2018, NR) *400 metres \u2013 52.19 (Geneva 2018) Indoor *60 metres \u2013 7.31 (Athlone 2017) *200 metres \u2013 23.55 (Athlone 2017) *400 metres \u2013 52.08 (Vienna 2018) *1000 metres - 02.43.05 (Ballybeg 2018)(Previously reported as a 1200m time but was actually 1000) ==References== *All-Athletics profile Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Irish female sprinters Category:Sportspeople from County Cork Category:Competitors at the 2017 Summer Universiade Category:Competitors at the 2019 Summer Universiade ",
