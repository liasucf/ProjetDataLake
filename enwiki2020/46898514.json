    "text": "Finbar Lynch (born 28 August 1959) is an Irish actor. Lynch was born in Dublin, and at the age of 11, moved with his family to the village of Inverin, County Galway where his father ran a clothing factory under a scheme to encourage business investment in Gaeltacht areas. Lynch has 2 brothers. Back in Dublin at the age of 18, Lynch doorknocked local theatres seeking acting work, but was turned down due to lack of experience. Working as a stagehand, he successfully auditioned for a minor role in the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire, which started off his acting career. In 1999, Lynch was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play for his performance as Canary Jim in the Broadway run of the rediscovered Tennessee Williams play Not About Nightingales. Lynch's television work includes recurring appearances in the soap opera Glenroe, Proof, Breathless and the miniseries Small World; as well as minor appearances in Waking the Dead, Dalziel and Pascoe, Inspector George Gently, DCI Banks, Game of Thrones, Foyle's War, and The Mallorca Files. Lynch is married to actress Niamh Cusack and they have one son, Calam Lynch, who is also an actor. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Irish male stage actors Category:Irish male television actors Category:Irish male film actors Category:Male actors from County Galway Category:Male actors from Dublin (city) ",
