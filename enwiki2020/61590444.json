It connects Decherd with McMinnville via Hillsboro and Viola. ==Route description== SR 127 begins in Franklin County in Decherd at an intersection with US 41A/SR 16 at the northern edge of town. It goes northeast through farmland to have an intersection with SR 279 before crossing the Woods Reservoir/Elk River and entering Coffee County shortly thereafter. The highway then passes through wooded areas, where it passes by Arnold Air Force Base, before crossing over I-24, without an interchange, and entering Hillsboro. SR 127 then passes by several homes and businesses before having an intersection with US 41/SR 2. It then leaves Hillsboro and continues northeast through farmland and rural areas along the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau for several miles before crossing into Warren County.
