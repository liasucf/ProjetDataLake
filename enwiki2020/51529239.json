    "text": "Cohesity is a privately held information technology company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company develops software that allows IT professionals to backup, manage and gain insights from their data, across multiple systems or cloud providers. ==History== Cohesity was founded in June 2013 by Mohit Aron, who previously co-founded storage company Nutanix. While still in stealth mode, it closed a Series A funding round of $15M. The company launched publicly in June 2015, introducing a platform designed to consolidate and manage secondary data. In October, Cohesity announced the public launch of its data management products, DataPlatform and DataProtect. As part of coming out of stealth mode, the company announced a Series B funding round of $55M, bringing its total at that point to $70M. In February 2016, the company announced the second generation of DataPlatform and DataProtect. In June, the company launched its 3.0 products, expanding data protection to physical servers. Also by June, the company had raised $70 million in venture funding in two rounds with Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, and Sequoia Capital. On April 4, 2017, Cohesity announced a $90 million Series C funding round, led by GV, the venture capital arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Sequoia Capital. On June 11, 2018, the company announced a Series D funding round of $250 million led by Softbank Vision Fund. In August, the company introduced a SaaS-based management console called Helios. In February 2019, Cohesity launched their online MarketPlace to sell applications that run on its DataPlatform. In May, the company made its first acquisition by buying Imanis Data, a provider of NoSQL data protection software. In July, the company announced it would be recognizing revenue predominantly from software, transitioning away from recognizing hardware revenue from the sale of backup appliances. ==Products== Cohesity develops software used to consolidate and simplify data management, and includes analytics capabilities. The company's software also solves the problem of mass data fragmentation, as data proliferates across multiple systems or cloud providers. The company's main product, DataPlatform, is hyper converged software that allows businesses to consolidate a variety of workloads, including backups, archives, test and development, along with analytics data, onto a single cloud-native platform. It works with physical servers as well as virtual machines. The company also develops data management and backup software called DataProtect, which runs on DataPlatform. As of 2019, the most current version was code-named Pegasus. Through the acquisition of Imanis Data, Cohesity extends backup capabilities to NoSQL workloads distributed databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Hbase, as well as Hadoop data on Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) datastores. The company's Helios SaaS management tool provides a dashboard view of a customer's DataPlatform sites, including local and remote; on- premises; and in the public cloud. The company's MarketPlace allows customers to purchase the company's other applications, as well as third party apps that run on the company's DataPlatform. The company also makes a software development kit (SDK) available for programmers who want to develop their own apps for DataPlatform. ==References== ==External links== Official website Category:American companies established in 2013 Category:Companies based in Santa Clara, California Category:Computer storage companies ",
