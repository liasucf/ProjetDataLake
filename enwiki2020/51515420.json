    "text": "Boker's Bitters was a brand of bitters, specified in nearly every cocktail that called for bitters in Jerry Thomas' 1862 book, How to Mix Drinks or The Bon Vivant's Companion. Among the known ingredients were cassia, cardamom, and bitter orange peel. The Boker's company was a leading brand of bitters until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and eventually closed during the Prohibition era in the 1920s. ==History== Johann Gottlieb B\u00f6ker created the bitters in 1828. The Boker's company was a leading brand of bitters until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and eventually closed during the Prohibition era in the 1920s. Until 2009, no samples of the bitters were known to exist, and as the recipe had never been published, recreating it seemed unlikely. That year, a man showed up at the London Bar Show with a small remaining sample, which was then combined with extensive research (including interviewing descendants of John Boker), to recreate a facsimile of the bitters. ==Cocktails with Boker\u2019s Bitters== *Absinthe Cocktail *Champagne Cocktail *East India Cocktail *Faivre's Pousse Cafe *Fancy Brandy Cocktail *Gin Cocktail *Improved Cocktail *Japanese Cocktail *Jersey Cocktail *Knickerbein *Manhattan Cocktail *Martinez *Old Tom Gin Cocktail *St. Croix Crusta *Saratoga Cocktail *Sherry Wine and Bitters *Soda Cocktail *Vermouth Cocktail *Whiskey Cocktail *Whiskey Crusta ==References== ==External links== * The Bitters Truth * The Bitter Truth Bogart`s Bitters (Bokers Bitters Replica) * Boker's Bitters * Boker's Bitters - Dr. Adam Elmegirab * Review: Dr Adam Elmegirab Bitters * The Jerry Thomas Project: Dr. Adam Elmegirab's Bitters - The story... * Boker's Bitters by Adam Elmegirab Review / Notes * The New and Improved Illustrated Bartenders' Manual; Or: How to Mix Drinks of the Present Style * Jerry Thomas' Bartenders Guide: How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks Category:Bitters ",
