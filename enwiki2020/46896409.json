After graduating from the English program at Firda Upper Secondary School in Sandane in 1941, Djupedal studied at the University of Oslo until the fall of 1943. He was arrested on November 30 that year and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp as one of the approximately 650 male students at the University of Oslo interned in German prison camps during the Second World War II from December 1943 to liberation in May 1945 and known as the \"German students\" (). He returned home in the spring of 1945 and resumed his studies at the University of Oslo, and in 1950 he received a degree in historical linguistics with a dissertation titled Noko om Ivar Aasen i \u00e5ra 1840\u201360 (Ivar Aasen in the Years 1840\u20131860). In 1950 and 1951 he worked on the Norsk Ordbok (Norwegian Dictionary).Griegs, J. 1963. \u00c5rsmelding fra det Akademiske kollegium. Bergen: University of Bergen, p. 210. From 1951 to 1956 he taught Norwegian at the University of Copenhagen and in Aarhus, and from 1962 to 1969 he taught Nordic linguistics at the University of Bergen. In 1969 he became a professor at the Norwegian College of General Sciences, remaining in this position until he retired in 1988. Djupedal is especially known for his work on Ivar Aasen; among other things, he published Aasen's letters and diaries in three volumes, and together with Johannes Gjerd\u00e5ker he also published Aasen's Norske ordsprog (Norwegian Proverbs) and wrote a long afterword for the work.
