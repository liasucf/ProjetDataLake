The front of the school has two entrances with columns on either side of each entrance and a central cupola. The bell tower in the cupola is covered in copper.

In 1913, a student at the school sued the principal for whipping him. After two trials, the principal was acquitted. In 1971, the school was closed due to a levy defeat, and was leased for some time by a local church. At an unknown date, the building was reopened as a school. The school underwent internal renovations during the 2017-2018 school year. ==References== ==External link== *Official website Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pierce County, Washington Category:Neoclassical architecture in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1912 ",
