Shortly before he died, he had added the surname Currer to his own name. This was a condition of a substantial inheritance from Sarah Currer, the grand daughter of Matthew Wilson who had built Eshton Hall. Frances received a further inheritance which included the library of Richard Richardson, her great-grandfather.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Richardson, Henry (1)s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Richardson, Henry (2) The Bierley estate she had inherited was the site of mining operations under a lease for mineral rights, for 46 years, granted by Currer in 1800, to Henry Leah. Currer had problems with her hearing throughout her life and she died at Eshton Hall in 1861. ==Bibliophile== Frances Currer had always had an interest in books. In 1820 she had a catalogue prepared and privately printedA catalogue of the library of Miss Currer at Eshton Hall, in the deanery of Craven and county of York and in 1833 she had Thomas Hartwell Horne prepare a second edition which was printed to reflect further changes. Thomas Frognall Dibdin wrote in 1838 that her library was one of the best in the country. Althorpe, Chatsworth and Stowe were the only libraries he thought more extensive. Dibdin is quoted as calling her the \"head of all female book collectors in Europe.\"Owned by women, University of Glasgow Special Collections, retrieved 2 November 2014 He estimated that the library contained 20,000 books, but Currer was one of his patrons. Dibdin also spoke well of the book collections of Richard Heber which were larger than Currer's. Heber and Currer had a close relationship and Heber was bailed out by Currer when he had financial difficulties. Eshton Hall LibraryStewart, C.J.

London: Privately printed, 1833 ==Benefactor== Frances Currer gave money to the North Bierley chapel. Its foundation dated back to Richard Richardson (1708\u20131781), son of Dr. Richard Richardson, and it had been licensed in 1766. It was only in her time, however, that it was consecrated, in 1824, and she became its patron. It was enlarged at her expense in the following years, and became a chapel of ease. She put up a vicarage there in 1827, for George Stringer Bull. St John the Evangelist church, the former Bierley chapel, today It is thought that Currer gave Patrick Bront\u00eb of Haworth \u00a350 when he became a widower in 1821. Currer donated money to the Clergy Daughter's School in Lancashire that the Bront\u00eb sisters attended in 1824\u20135, and funded the local mechanics institute. It has been speculated that her philanthropy was the reason that Charlotte Bront\u00eb chose the nom de plume of \"Currer Bell\" for her 1847 novel Jane Eyre.Wilson Family, North Building Preservation Trust, retrieved 1 November 2014 A figure connecting Bierley and Haworth was James Bardsley. Patrick Bront\u00eb hoped in 1833 to have him as curate, but the permission of Edward Venables-Vernon- Harcourt, the Archbishop of York, was refused. He became curate at the Bierley chapel. ==References== Category:1785 births Category:1861 deaths Category:English book and manuscript collectors Category:19th-century English landowners Category:19th-century women landowners ",
