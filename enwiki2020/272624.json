    "text": "Grayson Perry (born 24 March 1960) is an English contemporary artist, writer and broadcaster. He is known for his ceramic vases, tapestries and cross- dressing, as well as his observations of the contemporary arts scene, and for dissecting British \"prejudices, fashions and foibles\". Perry's vases have classical forms and are decorated in bright colours, depicting subjects at odds with their attractive appearance. There is a strong autobiographical element in his work, in which images of Perry as \"Claire\", his female alter- ego, and \"Alan Measles\", his childhood teddy bear, often appear. He has made a number of documentary television programmes and has curated exhibitions. He has published two autobiographies, Grayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl (2007) and The Descent of Man (2016), written and illustrated a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence (2012), written a book about art, Playing to the Gallery (2014), and published his illustrated Sketchbooks (2016). Various books describing his work have been published. In 2013 he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures.Simon Kelner, \"How Grayson Perry and The Reith Lectures will restore your faith in the BBC\". The Independent, 16 October 2013. Accessed 28 December 2017. Perry has had solo exhibitions at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Barbican Centre, the British Museum and the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Arnolfini in Bristol, The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. His work is held in the permanent collections of the British Council and Arts Council, Crafts Council, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003. He was interviewed about the win and resulting press in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World. In 2008 he was ranked number 32 in The Daily Telegraph's list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". In 2012, Perry was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover\u2014to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. ==Personal life== ===Early life and education=== Born into a working-class family, Perry was four years old when his father, Tom, left home after discovering his mother, Jean, was having an affair with a milkman, whom she later married and who Perry has claimed was violent. Subsequently, he spent an unhappy childhood moving between his parents and created a fantasy world based around his teddy in order to cope with his sense of anxiety. He considers that a person\u2019s early experiences are important in shaping their aesthetic and sexuality. Following the encouragement of his art teacher, Perry decided to study art. He did an art foundation course at Braintree College of Further Education from 1978 to 1979. He spent a short period of his school life at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford (KEGS), but mainly he studied for a BA in fine art at Portsmouth College of Art and Design, graduating in 1982.Wilson, Andrew. Grayson Perry: General Artist He had an interest in film and exhibited his first piece of pottery at a New Contemporaries show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1980. In the months following his graduation he joined The Neo Naturists, a group started by Christine Binnie to revive the \"true sixties spirit \u2013 which involves living one's life more or less naked and occasionally manifesting it into a performance for which the main theme is body paint\".Dawson, p. 81 They put on events at galleries and other venues. In this time Perry was living in squats in central London. When he left for Portsmouth in 1979, his stepfather told him \"Don't come back\". Perry has been estranged from his mother since the 1990s. ===Modern day=== As of 2010 he lives in north London with his wife, the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. They have one daughter, Florence, born in 1992. In 2007 Perry curated an exhibition of art by prisoners and ex- offenders entitled Insider Art at the Institute of Contemporary Arts presented by the Koestler Trust, a charity which promotes art as rehabilitation in prisons, young offenders institutions and secure psychiatric units. He described the art works as \"raw and all the more powerful for that\". In 2011 he returned to the annual Koestler Trust exhibition, this time held at London's Southbank Centre and judged the award winners in Art by Offenders with Will Self and Emma Bridgewater. In 2015 he was appointed to succeed Kwame Kwei-Armah as chancellor of University of the Arts London. Perry is a keen mountain biker and motorcyclist. Perry is a supporter of the Labour Party, and has designed works of art to raise funds for the party. In September 2015, Perry endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Perry said he would back Corbyn as he was \"doing something interesting for the political debate.\" He added: \"I think he's gold.\" In October 2016, he said that Jeremy Corbyn had \"no chance of winning an election\". ===Cross-dressing=== Perry describes his first sexual experience at the age of seven when he tied himself up in his pyjamas. From an early age he liked to dress in women's clothes and in his teens realised that he was a transvestite. At the age of 15 he moved in with his father's family in Chelmsford, where he began to go out dressed as a woman. When he was discovered by his father he said he would stop but his stepmother told everyone about it and a few months later threw him out. He returned to his mother and stepfather at Great Bardfield. Perry dressed as Claire, promoting a 2017 exhibition Perry frequently appears in public dressed as a woman, and he has described his female alter-ego, \"Claire\", variously as \"a 19th century reforming matriarch, a middle-England protester for No More Art, an aero- model-maker, or an Eastern European Freedom Fighter\",Grayson Perry: guerrilla tactics, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 2002 and \"a fortysomething woman living in a Barratt home, the kind of woman who eats ready meals and can just about sew on a button\".Perry, pp. 8-9 [more detail needed] In his work Perry includes pictures of himself in women's clothes: for example Mother of All Battles (1996) is a photograph of Claire holding a gun and wearing a dress, in ethnic eastern European style, embroidered with images of war, exhibited at his 2002 Guerrilla Tactics show. One critic has called Perry \"The social critic from hell\". Perry has designed many of Claire's outfits himself. Also, fashion students at Central Saint Martins art college in London take part in an annual competition to design new dresses for Claire. An exhibition, Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry's Dresses, was held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, from November 2017 to February 2018.\"Grayson Perry's dresses really are works of art in new exhibition\", BBC News, 3 November 2017. Accessed 9 January 2018\"Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry\u2019s Dresses: 4 November 2017 \u2013 4 February 2018\", Walker Art Gallery. Accessed 9 January 2018 ==Work== As well as ceramics, Perry has worked in printmaking, drawing, embroidery and other textile work, film and performance. He has written a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence. ===Ceramics=== The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam mounted a solo exhibition of his work in 2002, Guerrilla Tactics. It was partly for this work that he was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003, the first time it was given to a ceramic artist. Perry's work refers to several ceramic traditions, including Greek pottery and folk art.DT, p.70 [more detail needed] He has said, \"I like the whole iconography of pottery. It hasn't got any big pretensions to being great public works of art, and no matter how brash a statement I make, on a pot it will always have certain humility ... [F]or me the shape has to be classical invisible: then you've got a base that people can understand\".Perry, pp.14 and 24 [more detail needed] His vessels are made by coiling, a traditional method. Most have a complex surface employing many techniques, including \"glazing, incision, embossing, and the use of photographic transfers\", which requires several firings. To some he adds sprigs, little relief sculptures stuck to the surface. The high degree of skill required by his ceramics and their complexity distances them from craft pottery. It has been said that these methods are not used for decorative effect but to give meaning. Perry challenges the idea, implicit in the craft tradition, that pottery is merely decorative or utilitarian and cannot express ideas. In his work Perry reflects upon his upbringing as a boy, his stepfather's anger and the absence of proper guidance about male conduct. Perry's understanding of the roles in his family is portrayed in Using My Family, from 1998, where a teddy bear provides affection, and the contemporaneous The Guardians, which depicts his mother and stepfather. Much of Perry's work contains sexually explicit content. Some of his sexual imagery has been described as \"obscene sadomasochistic sex scenes\". He also has a reputation for depicting child abuse and yet there are no works depicting sexual child abuse although We've Found the Body of your Child, 2000 hints at emotional child abuse and child neglect. In other work he juxtaposes decorative clich\u00e9s like flowers with weapons and war. Perry combines various techniques as a \"guerrilla tactic\", using the approachable medium of pottery to provoke thought. ===Tapestries=== Perry created the 15 m x 3 m The Walthamstow Tapestry in 2009. The large woven tapestry bears hundreds of brand names surrounding large figures in the stages of life from birth to death.\"The Walthamstow Tapestry by Grayson Perry, 2009\", Paragon Press. Accessed 20 December 2017. Perry's 2012 TV documentary series All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry, about class \"taste\" variables, included him making large tapestries, called The Vanity of Small Differences.\"Grayson Perry: The Vanity of Small Differences\", British Council. Accessed 4 January 2018. Their format was inspired by William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress. Of the tapestries, Perry says, > The Vanity of Small Differences consists of six tapestries that tell the > story of Tim Rakewell. Some of the characters, incidents and objects I have > included I encountered whilst filming All in the Best Possible Taste. The > tapestries tell a story of class mobility. I think nothing has such a strong > influence on our aesthetic taste as the social class we grow up in. The sketches were translated using Adobe Photoshop to design the finished images and the tapestries were woven on a computer controlled loom. Perry produced a pair of large-scale tapestries for A House for Essex, called The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope in 2015. ===A House for Essex (\"Julie's House\") (2012\u20132015)=== A House for Essex (\"Julie's House\"), a commission for Living Architecture. In 2015 the external work was completed on a holiday home in Wrabness, Essex,Tendring District Council plannnig application 12/00880/FUL created by Perry working with Fashion Architecture Taste (FAT). It overlooks the River Stour, after a commission from Living Architecture, the charity founded by the philosopher Alain de Botton, and is known as both A House for Essex, and \"Julie's House.\" The house encapsulates the story of Julie May Cope, a fictional Essex woman, \"Born in a flood-struck Canvey Island in 1953 and mown down last year by a curry delivery driver in Colchester\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ellis Woodman said, \"Sporting a livery of green and white ceramic tiles, telephone-box red joinery and a gold roof, it is not easy to miss. ... Decoration is everywhere: from the external tiles embossed with motifs referencing Julie's rock-chick youth to extravagant tapestries recording her life's full narrative. Perry has contributed ceramic sculptures, modelled on Irish Sheelanagigs, which celebrate her as a kind of latter-day earth mother while the delivery driver's moped has even been repurposed as a chandelier suspended above the double-height living room.\" Perry made a variety of artwork used inside the house, depicting Julie Cope's life. He made a series of large-scale tapestries, The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope, which include \"A Perfect Match\" (2015) and \"In Its Familiarity, Golden\" (2015), and for the bedrooms, \"Julie and Rob\" (2013) and \"Julie and Dave\" (2015). He also wrote an essay, \"The Ballad of Julie Cope\" (2015) and created a series of black and white woodcuts, Six Snapshots of Julie (2015).Mark Edwards \"Tapestry of Essex Everywoman\u2019s life caught at Grayson Perry\u2019s Firstsite show\", Ipswich Star, 12 December 2017.

Accessed 9 January 2018 ==Media== ===Television=== In 2005, Perry presented a Channel 4 documentary, Why Men Wear Frocks, in which he examined transvestism and masculinity at the start of the 21st century. Perry talked about his own life as a transvestite and the effect it had on him and his family, frankly discussing its difficulties and pleasures. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award for best network production.\"Royal Television Society Regional Centres' Awards 2005\", Royal Television Society. Accessed 13 December 2017. He was the subject of a The South Bank Show episode in 2006 and the subject of an Imagine documentary broadcast in November 2011.\"Map of an Englishman\", BBC, 24 May 2007 His three-part series for Channel 4, All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry, was broadcast in June 2012. The series analysed the ideas of taste held by the different social classes of the UK. Perry explores both male and female culture in each social class and what they buy, in three parts: \"Working Class Taste,\" \"Middle Class Taste,\" and \"Upper Class Taste.\" At the same time, he photographs, then illustrates his experiences and the people, transcribing them into large tapestries, entitled The Vanity of Small Differences. In 2014, Perry presented a three-part documentary series for Channel 4, Who Are You?, on identity. In it he creates diverse portraits for the National Portrait Gallery, London, of ex-MP Chris Huhne, Rylan Clark-Neal from The X Factor, a Muslim convert and a young transgender man.\"Grayson Perry: Who Are You?\", Channel 4. Accessed 30 December 2017. In 2016, he presented a series exploring masculinity for Channel 4, Grayson Perry: All Man. In 2018, Perry explored Rites of Passage in a four-part documentary series on Channel 4. The documentary series focused on death, marriage, birth, and coming of age as Perry compared the way people in the UK dealt with these themes compared to others around the world. Each episode culminated in Perry helping those in the UK to create ceremonies that were appropriate to their own situations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Perry presented Grayson's Art Club from his home studio, encouraging viewers to produce and share their own artworks from lockdown.Evening Standard https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/grayson-perry-interview-lockdown- inspiration-graysons-art-club-a4424791.html In 2020 Channel 4 broadcast the series Grayson Perry's Big American Road Trip.
