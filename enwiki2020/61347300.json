    "text": "M\u00e1rio Caetano Filho, better known as Marinho (born 27 February 1955) is a Brazilian former professional football player who played as a centre-back. He is most well-known for his time at Flamengo beginning in 1980. == Career == === Club career === Marinho began his career in the youth academy of Londrina in 1973. He made his professional debut on 2 April 1975 as a substitute in a 1-0 victory over Am\u00e9rica (SP). In 1976 he was loaned to Umuarama and Linense but returned to Londrina that same year. Viewed as a valuable prospect, he caught the attention of S\u00e3o Paulo who he played for on loan in 1977. He only played 5 matches but made part of the team that won the 1977 Brazilian Championship. Still playing as a defender for Londrina, Marinho scored 6 goals in 1978 and 7 goals in 1979. He caught the attention of Flamengo manager Cl\u00e1udio Coutinho who made his acquisition a priority. Marinho was transferred for 5 million cruzeiro, the largest outgoing transfer fee from the state of Paran\u00e1 at the time. Marinho was very successful at Flamengo from 1980 to 1984. His Flamengo debut came in a scoreless draw in a friendly against former club S\u00e3o Paulo. Marinho played alongside Zico, J\u00fanior and Leandro and was part of the team that won the 1981 Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica and 1981 Intercontinental Cup. Marinho and centre-back partner Mozer were in the starting lineup in the third and decisive match against Cobreloa in the 1981 Libertadores final. Three weeks later the same defense faced and defeated Liverpool. Marinho was also involved in the 1980, 1982 and 1983 Brazilian Championship-winning teams. After a fruitful period at Flamengo, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro negotiated for the centre-back. He played there from April to August 1984. The following year he moved to Botafogo where he played until 1988. He played short stints at Arapongas and Umuarama before retiring from Londrina in 1989 at the age of 37. He returned to Flamengo for one farewell match in 1990. === National team === Marinho played for the Brazilian national team in 1983 under manager Carlos Alberto Parreira in friendlies against Chile and the \"Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Ga\u00facha\" (selection from the state of Rio Grande do Sul). == Titles == Londrina * Campeonato do Interior Paranaense: 1976 S\u00e3o Paulo * Campeonato Brasileiro: 1977 Flamengo * Copa Libertadores: 1981 * Intercontinental Cup: 1981 * Campeonato Carioca: 1981 * Campeonato Brasileiro: 1980, 1982, 1983 * Ta\u00e7a Guanabara: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1984 * Ta\u00e7a Rio: 1983 ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Living people Category:Association football central defenders Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Londrina Esporte Clube players Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas players Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro players ",
