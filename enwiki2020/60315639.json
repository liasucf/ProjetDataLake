The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 17th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self. ==Season notes== The Jayhawks attempted to rebound from losing six players through the draft and outgoing transfers, including Silvio De Sousa, who had been battling the NCAA regarding his eligibility. De Sousa did state if he wins his appeal regarding the NCAA declaring him ineligible, he would return to Kansas. On May 24, 2019, he won his appeal. Kansas was ranked 3rd in the preseason AP Poll, their 7th consecutive season beginning the season ranked in the top five. Additionally, it was the 201st consecutive poll the Jayhawks have been ranked in, which is the longest active streak in the nation. As of the poll released March 9, 2020, the Jayhawks have extended the streak to 219 consecutive polls ranked. They have not played a game as an unranked team since January 31, 2009. After defeating TCU on March 4, 2020, the Jayhawks clinched their 62nd Regular Season Conference Championship, and their 15th in 16 seasons. It was the first time since the 2009-10 season that KU finished the regular season ranked first in the nation. Additionally, the Jayhawks led the nation in quadrant one wins, went undefeated against unranked teams and only lost games to ranked teams, one each at neutral site, home, and away. The Jayhawks set a team record for combined team GPA with a GPA of 3.21. ===COVID-19 pandemic impact=== The 2020 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament was cancelled March 12 before the quarterfinals were able to begin; The Jayhawks were scheduled to play Oklahoma State.
