    "text": "H\u00e4ringe-Hammersta Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in Stockholm County in Sweden. The nature reserve consists of two peninsulas and several different kinds of landscape types. H\u00e4ringe Castle is located within the nature reserve, as is Hammersta Manor and castle ruins. South of H\u00e4ringe Castle, the landscape consists of open, arable land with interspersed groves dominated by maple, linden and sloan. Beneath the trees, flowers such as sweetscented bedstraw, spring vetchling, common toothwort and Viola mirabilis are known to grow. Further south the landscape changes into contiguous old coniferous forest. A small lake (Lake Bob\u00e4cken) as well as the inlets of the sea provide important habitats for birds, who come here to rest during their annual spring migration. Birds such as swans and ducks also attract white-tailed eagles. The area is rich in game such as fox, hare, roe deer and badger. The other part of the nature reserve, the Hammersta peninsula, contains some of the richest broad-leaf forest in Stockholm County. The landscape here is characterised especially by several very old oak trees. Notably, several unusual species of grass grows in the area, including Bromus benekenii, wood melick, Poa remota and Hordelymus europaeus. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Geography of Stockholm County Category:Tourist attractions in Stockholm County Category:Protected areas established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Sweden ",
