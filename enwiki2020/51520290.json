    "text": "Hecho en China (literally: Made In China) is a 2012 Mexican road movie directed and written by Gabriel Guzm\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, and starring Odiseo Bichir. It is produced by Alejandra Garcia and Antonio Urdapilleta for IMAGYX Entertainment, Canal 22 and IMCINE. It was filmed in Mexico and first released on March 7, 2012 at the Guadalajara International Film Festival. == Plot == Marcos Marquez (Bichir) has just turned 50. He's a serious, respectful, knowing man living in Tijuana, owner of a Chinese restaurant he inherited from his parents. But Marcos isn't thrilled about celebrating his birthday because it reminds him of his vanishing youth dreams. But this time it's different: he's just received an invitation to Clara's wedding, the only girlfriend he ever had, as well as threats from a Chinese mobster who's forcing him to sell his business. Since he hates flying, Marcos decides to drive to the wedding in Monterrey (a city on the opposite side of the country). What he doesn't know is that Fernando (Hern\u00e1ndez), his 18-year-old rebellious employee, is riding in his trunk. When Marcos finds Fernando, they're forced to ride together, pushing Marcos to experience things he's never had the courage to do, realizing that even though he's 50, he's still capable of making his dreams come true. == Cast == * Odiseo Bichir as Marcos M\u00e1rquez * V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez as Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez * Carlos Cobos as Odiseo * Eduardo Espa\u00f1a as George * Claudia Ram\u00edrez as Clara * Mario Zaragoza as Tony (the mechanic) * Omar Fierro as Homero Garza * Norma Ang\u00e9lica as Mrs. Gilda * Taka as Yang Li * David Loji as Juan Mao * David Colorado as Nacho * David Arauza as Polic\u00eda de Caminos * Eduardo Cant\u00fa as Marcos (11 years-old) * Nancy Zhou as Pei-Pei * Francisco Colmenero as the Narrator == Production == Hecho en China is one of three winning films of the Primera Convocatoria de Apoyo a la Producci\u00f3n de Largometraje Telefilm Digital (First Digital TV Feature Film Production Competition) organized by Canal 22 (a television station operated by the Mexican Secretariat of Culture) and FOPROCINE (Film Production Fund) through IMCINE (the Mexican Film Institute), to promote the production of Mexican cinema. The film has the sad distinction of having one of the last screen appearances of the late actor Carlos Cobos, an Ariel Award winner for the film Pastorela (2011), who passed away months before the film's premiere. == Reception == The film received favorable reviews through the festival circuit. Brazilian critics compared some of its sequences with films such as Am\u00e9lie and the Argentinian Chinese Take-Away (Un cuento chino). == Distinctions == === Awards === {| class=\"wikitable\" !
