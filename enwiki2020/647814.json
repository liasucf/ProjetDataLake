He was named to NBA All-Rookie First Team in his first season, averaging a team leading 19.7 points and 6.5 rebounds and leading the Nets to the 1998 NBA Playoffs, where they were swept in three games by the Chicago Bulls. His best season as came in 1999, where he averaged a team-leading 21.8 points per game (fifth in the NBA) as well as 8.5 rebounds per game. He was an important part of the 2001\u201302 Nets team that won the Eastern Conference Finals, leading the team in rebounding and placing second in scoring, but was eventually swept by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2002 NBA Finals. He hit the game-winning three-point shot against the Boston Celtics in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals to send the Nets to the NBA Finals. He ranks in the Nets' top ten in several statistical categories including points, field goals made, three-point field goals made and attempted, and offensive and defensive rebounds. ===Philadelphia 76ers=== On August 6, 2002, Van Horn was traded to his original team, the Philadelphia 76ers, along with Todd MacCulloch for center Dikembe Mutombo. He spent one year with the 76ers placing second on the team in scoring and rebounding while the 76ers made the second round of the NBA playoffs. ===New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks=== After spending the year with the 76ers he was traded to the New York Knicks in a four team deal that also included the Atlanta Hawks and Minnesota Timberwolves. His stint with the Knicks, although productive, was short; on February 16, 2004, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a three team trade for Tim Thomas. ===Dallas Mavericks=== In order to make salary cap room for the signing of free-agent-to-be Michael Redd in the coming off- season, on February 24, 2005, the Bucks traded Van Horn to the Dallas Mavericks for the expiring contracts of Alan Henderson, Calvin Booth and cash. He spent nearly two seasons with the Mavericks playing a key sixth man role and helping the Mavericks win the Western Conference Finals before losing in the NBA Finals to the Miami Heat. ===Free agency and retirement=== Following the 2005\u201306 season, he took a year off in order to spend time with his family. On February 19, 2008, Van Horn signed a three-year deal (only the first year guaranteed) with the Mavericks in order to help complete a blockbuster trade that sent Jason Kidd from the Nets to the Mavericks and Devin Harris to the Nets. As expected, Van Horn did not play at all for the Nets and was waived on October 23, 2008, and earned $4.3 million without playing. Van Horn finished his NBA career with averages of 16.0 points per game and nearly seven rebounds per game. ==Personal life== Van Horn's and the Nets' success in his rookie year led him to be the first white player on the cover of SLAM Magazine.

Sabrina played soccer for Mullen High School in Denver. Van Horn helped coach the basketball teams of his two other daughters. Having counseled Van Horn through the death of his father during his freshman season, Rick Majerus became close to Van Horn and was the godfather of Noelle.
