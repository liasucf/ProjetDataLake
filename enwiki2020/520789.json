    "text": "Clara Lou Sheridan (February 21, 1915 \u2013 January 21, 1967), known professionally as Ann Sheridan, was an American actress and singer. She worked regularly from 1934 until her death, first in film and later in television. Notable roles include San Quentin (1937) with Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart, Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) with James Cagney and Bogart, They Drive by Night (1940) with George Raft and Bogart, The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942) with Monty Woolley, Kings Row (1942) with Ronald Reagan, Nora Prentiss (1947), and I Was a Male War Bride (1949) with Cary Grant. ==Life and career== Born in Denton, Texas, on February 21, 1915, Clara Lou Sheridan was the youngest of five children (Kitty, Pauline, Mabel and George) of George W. Sheridan and Lula Stewart (n\u00e9e Warren). According to Sheridan, her father was a grandnephew of Civil War Union general Philip Sheridan. She was active in dramatics at Denton High School and at North Texas State Teachers College. She also sang with the college's stage band and played basketball on the North Texas women's basketball team. In 1933, her sister Kitty entered Sheridan's photograph into a beauty contest, which subsequently won the prize of a bit part in a Paramount film, Search for Beauty released the following year. ===Paramount=== After making her film debut at 19 in Search for Beauty, she played uncredited bit parts under contract in Paramount films for the next two years starting at $75 a week (). She can be glimpsed in the following 1934 films, and if credited, as Clara Lou Sheridan: Bolero, Come On Marines!, Murder at the Vanities, Shoot the Works, Kiss and Make-Up, The Notorious Sophie Lang, College Rhythm (directed by Norman Taurog whom Sheridan admired), Ladies Should Listen, You Belong to Me, Wagon Wheels, The Lemon Drop Kid, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, Ready for Love, Limehouse Blues, and One Hour Late. Sheridan worked with Paramount's drama coach Nina Mouise and performed plays on the lot with fellow contractees, including The Milky Way and The Pursuit of Happiness. When she did The Milky Way, she played a character called Ann and the Paramount front office decided to change her name to \"Ann\". Sheridan gained a part in Behold My Wife! (1934), at the behest of director and friend Mitchell Leisen. She had two standout scenes in the film, one in which her character had to commit suicide. Sheridan attributed Paramount's keeping her for two years to this role.Hagen p 172 She followed it with Enter Madame (1935), Home on the Range (1935), and Rumba (1935). Sheridan's first lead came in Car 99 (1935) with Fred MacMurray. She was in Rocky Mountain Mystery (1935), a Randolph Scott Western. \"No acting, it was just playing the lead, that's all\", she later said. She then appeared in Mississippi (1935) with Bing Crosby and W. C. Fields, The Glass Key (1935) with George Raft, and (having one line) The Crusades (1935) with Loretta Young. Paramount lent her out to Talisman, a small production company, to makeThe Red Blood of Courage (1935) with Kermit Maynard. After this, Paramount declined to take up her option. Sheridan made Fighting Youth (1935) at Universal and then signed a contract with Warner Bros. in 1936. ===Warner Bros.=== Sheridan's career prospects began to improve at her new studio. Her early films for Warner Bros. included Sing Me a Love Song (1936); Black Legion (1937) with Humphrey Bogart; The Great O'Malley (1937) with Pat O'Brien and Bogart, her first real break; San Quentin (1937), with O'Brien and Bogart, singing for the first time in a film; and Wine, Women and Horses (1937) with Barton MacLane.

She was a lead in The Patient in Room 18 (1937) and its sequel Mystery House (1938).

For Farrow, she was in Broadway Musketeers (1938), a remake of Three on a Match (1932). Sheridan and James Cagney in Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) Sheridan's notices in Letter of Introduction impressed Warner Bros. executives and she began to get roles in better quality pictures at her own studio starting with Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), wherein she played James Cagney's love interest; Bogart, O'Brien and the Dead End Kids had supporting roles. The film was a big hit and critically acclaimed. Sheridan was reunited with the Dead End Kids in They Made Me a Criminal (1938) starring John Garfield. She was third-billed in the Western Dodge City (1939), playing a saloon owner opposite Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film was another success. ===Oomph girl=== \"Oomph\" was described as \"a certain indefinable something that commands male interest.\" In March 1939, Warner Bros. announced Sheridan had been voted by a committee of 25 men as the actress with the most \"oomph\" in America. She received as many as 250 marriage proposals from fans in a single week.\"Everybody Wants to Marry Annie\", AP, May 25, 1941. Accessed June 2, 2009.
