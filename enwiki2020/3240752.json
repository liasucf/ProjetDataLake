    "text": "India's tribal belt refers to contiguous areas of settlement of Tribal people of India, that is, groups or tribes that remained genetically homogenous as opposed to other population groups that mixed widely within the Indian subcontinent. The tribal population in India, although a small minority, represents an enormous diversity of groups. They vary in language and linguistic traits, ecological settings in which they live, physical features, size of the population, the extent of acculturation, dominant modes of making a livelihood, level of development and social stratification. They are also spread over the length and breadth of the country though their geographical distribution is far from uniform. A majority of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in the eastern, central and western belt covering the nine States of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. About 12 percent inhabit the North-eastern region, about five percent in the Southern region and about three percent in the Northern States. ==Northwest India== The Tribal Belt of Northwest and east India includes the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The tribal people of this region have origins which precede the arrival of the Ancestral North Indians and are linked to the Ancestral South Indians. These people are thought to stem back to the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley, the oldest traceable civilization of the Indian subcontinent which flourished between 3500BC and 2500BC. The tribes of north-west India were once strongly matrilineal societies. The changing fates and fortunes of these people has caused a gradual evolution to a more patriarchal code of living. These days the tribal societies generally follow the rule of patriliny, but there remain many examples of organised matriarchy in existence in the tribal zones to this day. It is the women who organise matters such as relationships and marriages, the inheritance of land, and the distribution of wealth. == South Gujarat Tribal Belt == Rupugad Fort The Southern Tribal Belt, popularly known as Dang, a forbidden territory covered with thick forests in the region of the South Gujarat.
