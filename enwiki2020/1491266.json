After the death of his father, he surprisingly did not ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne. He led the funeral ceremony and the construction of Emperor Temmu's tomb but before the coronation, he died in 689 at the age of 28. He was posthumously titled . The location of his tomb is uncertain. Some suppose it to be in Takatori, Nara. He married his paternal cousin and maternal aunt, Princess Abe, the daughter of Emperor Tenji.
