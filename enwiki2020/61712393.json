    "text": "CamScanner is a Chinese mobile app first released in 2011 that allows iOS and Android devices to be used as image scanners. It allows users to 'scan' documents (by taking a photo with the device's camera) and share the photo as either a JPEG or PDF. This app is available for free on the Google Play Store and the App Store. The app is based on freemium model, with ad-supported free version and a premium version with additional functions. ==Charitable contributions== On April 20, 2020 CamScanner announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic that the company had enabled remote delivery for students and educators alike at no additional charge. The feature enabled students to scan assignments, make error sets, and modify documents online. While teachers were able to make electronic teach materials into PDF or Word document in order to collect and correct assignment online more seamlessly. ==Kaspersky Lab== On August 27, 2019, Russian Cyber Security company Kaspersky Lab discovered that recent versions of the Android app distributed an advertising library containing a Trojan Dropper, which was also included in some apps preinstalled on several Chinese mobiles. The advertising library decrypts a Zip archive which subsequently downloads additional files from servers controlled by hackers, allowing the hackers to control the device, including by showing intrusive advertising or charging paid subscriptions. Google took the app down after Kaspersky reported its findings. An updated version of the app with the advertising library removed was made available on the Google Play Store as of September 5, 2019. Kaspersky later acknowledged \"We appreciate the willingness to cooperate that we've seen from CamScanner representatives, as well as the responsible attitude to user safety they demonstrated while eliminating the threat\u2026The malicious modules were removed from the app immediately upon Kaspersky's warning, and Google Play has restored the app.\" ==India== In June 2020, the Government of India banned CamScanner along with 58 other apps citing data and privacy issues. ==References== Category:Image scanners Category:Mobile applications Category:Android (operating system) malware Category:Android (operating system) software Category:IOS software ",
