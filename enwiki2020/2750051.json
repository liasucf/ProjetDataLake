He served as Secretary of Labor in the cabinets of Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas and headed the Federal Comptroller's Secretariat in the cabinet of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Farell Cubillas was born in Mexico City to Spanish immigrants Enrique Farell Sol\u00e1 and Consuelo Cubillas Guti\u00e9rrez. His brother was General Luis Farell Cubillas. He received a bachelor, master and doctorate's degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he also taught several courses for almost 19 years (1954 - 1973) before heading the Mexican Institute of Social Security in the L\u00f3pez Portillo administration.Diccionario biogr\u00e1fico del gobierno mexicano, Ed. Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, Mexico, 1992.Muri\u00f3 Arsenio Farell Cubillas El Universal (16 de mayo de 2005) He was married to Rosa Mar\u00eda Campa Padilla. ==Cultural References== Arsenio Farrell Industrial Park (in the text, the name appears with an additional letter 'r') is a fictional maquiladora which is mentioned several times in Roberto Bola\u00f1o's final novel 2666, specifically, in book four, The Part About the Crimes. It has been reported that Arsenio Farell Cubillas had assisted PRI's (Institutional Revolutionary Party) Miguel Nazar Haro and Luis Echeverr\u00eda \u00c1lvarez to detain and torture suspected terrorists (leftists, intellectuals, etc.) during the Dirty War (Mexico), from 1964\u20131982. In the novel, several missing female persons are discovered at, or near, the maquiladora, which is located in Santa Teresa, a fictionalized version of Ciudad Juarez. The plot alludes to Northern Mexico's feminicide, beginning in the early 1990s and disproportionately affecting the border city. The maquiladoras also symbolize the PRI's long-standing facade of democracy and free trade built on the backs of the working poor. It has been reported that Farell helped cancel at least 400 unions across Mexico in the early 1990s.THE MEXICAN COORDINATION OF NATIONAL PUBLIC SECURITY, Ed. The Mexico Project, Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, June, 1994. Regardless, other sources suggest 80-90% of all Mexican unions had fallen prey to organized crime by the 1990s.Mexico\u2019s Labor Reform: A Workers\u2019 Defeat\u2014For Now NACLA, April 3, 2014. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:Mexican Secretaries of Labor Category:People from Mexico City Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni Category:Mexican lawyers Category:Mexican people of Catalan descent Category:20th-century lawyers ",
