Lurdes is a struggling woman who had four children: Magno, Ryan, \u00c9rica, and Dom\u00eanico, who was sold at the age of 2 by her ex- husband to child trafficker K\u00e1tia (Vera Holtz). Knowing that Dom\u00eanico was sent to Rio de Janeiro, Lurdes decides to go look for him with the rest of her children and, on the way, she finds the orphan Camila (Jessica Ellen), whom she decides to raise. Vit\u00f3ria is a 45-year-old lawyer who has been unable to get pregnant, so she decides to adopt a child. While waiting for her adopted son to arrive, she meets Davi (Vladimir Brichta). Vit\u00f3ria spends the night with him and is surprised to discover that she is pregnant. Thelma has been a widow for more than 20 years and is overprotective of her son Danilo (Chay Suede). When Danilo was a child he survived a fire that killed his father, thanks to his mother who saved him. Thelma's life changes when she discovers that she has an incurable brain aneurysm. She decides to make a list of things she wants to do before passing away, but all the wishes on her list involve Danilo, who does not know about the disease and wants to have distance from his mother because he feels suffocated.

Originally the plot would be called Troia, in reference to the mythological city, but the name was changed to Amor de M\u00e3e (Mother's Love) to better express the central plot around the three mothers. Filming of the telenovela began in August 2019. Amor de M\u00e3e was the first production to be filmed in Globo's newly opened MG4 studios. On 16 March 2020, it was announced that filming of the telenovela was suspended indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the final episode of the first part would air on 21 March 2020. Reruns of previous telenovelas currently occupy its timeslot. Filming resumed on 10 August 2020, with work pace being reduced to comply with safety guidelines. 23 episodes are planned to be filmed and will premiere in 2021. Part of the changes in production include actors arriving to the recording studios with their makeup and costumes ready. Those who need to travel for the studios are now staying in a hotel. Because of these changes, some actors were eliminated from the production, such as Alejandro Claveaux who portrayed Tales. == Ratings == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" | Episodes ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | First aired ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Last aired |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Viewers (points) ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Viewers (points) |- | 1 | | | 35 | | |} == References == == External links == * Category:2019 telenovelas Category:Rede Globo telenovelas Category:Brazilian telenovelas Category:2019 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2010s Brazilian television series Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic ",
