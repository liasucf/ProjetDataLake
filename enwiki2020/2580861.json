Piper was a Scottish- born military officer of Cornish parentage, who arrived in the colony in 1792 and built a neo-Palladian mansion on the point, on of land granted by the governor in 1816. After a review of Piper's performance as head of the Customs Department showed that he had mismanaged funds (although he was not actually accused of being corrupt), Piper attempted to drown himself in Sydney Harbour. He subsequently sold his holdings at Point Piper, Rose Bay, Neutral Bay, and Petersham for \u00a35,000 and moved to the country. In 1834, Piper's former residence was leased by Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873), the newly arrived Collector of Customs for New South Wales and a Crown appointee to the colony's Legislative Council. Colonel Gibbes and his family resided at Point Piper House (also known as \"Henrietta Villa\" or \"Naval Villa\") until 1844, when they moved to Wotonga, on Kirribilli Point. Wotonga now forms part of Admiralty House. Point Piper House was eventually torn down in the 1850s and the site was redeveloped.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 206 == Heritage listings == Point Piper has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 10 Dunara Gardens: Dunara ==Commercial area== Point Piper does not have a commercial area, and has few amenities or public facilities.
