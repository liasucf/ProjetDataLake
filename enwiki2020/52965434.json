    "text": "The Iowa State Cyclones women's volleyball team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The team is coached by Christy Johnson-Lynch, she is in her 12th year at Iowa State. The Cyclones play their home matches at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus. ==History== ===Early years=== Iowa State first put together a volleyball squad in 1973 under coach Gloria Crosby. Initially just playing in regional tournaments and the occasional one off match, they began participating in the brand new Big Eight tournament in 1976. Then in 1982 the Big Eight offered volleyball as a full sport including in-season conference play. The Cyclones struggled to put together competitive squads for most of their early years. Until 1995 they were unable to finish in the top half of the Big Eight. Jackie Nunez's 1995 team was the first in school history to make the NCAA Tournament to go along with their second-place finish in the conference. The 1997 transition to the Big 12 did not treat the Cyclones well. During their first nine seasons as a member of the Big 12, they were only able to win 13 out of 59 matches in conference play. ===Christy Johnson-Lynch (2005\u2013present)=== The hiring of Christy Johnson-Lynch in 2005 brought new life to the Cyclones as she has taken them to new heights. She took the Cyclones to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2006 and has returned every year since. This includes three Sweet 16 teams and two runs to Elite 8. She has produced 22 AVCA All-Americans. ==Record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |+ style=\"\" | Record |- align=center |- ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Head Coach ! style=\"\" |Overall Record ! style=\"\" |Conference Record ! style=\"\" |Conference Standing ! style=\"\" |Postseason |- | 1973 | Gloria Crosby | 22-8 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |- | 1974 | Gloria Crosby | 23-9 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |- | 1975 | Kay Pundt | 49-31 | \u2013 | \u2013 | \u2013 |- | 1976 | Diane Hale | 15-13-1 | \u2013 | 6th | \u2013 |- | 1977 | Diane Hale | 18-30-1 | \u2013 | T-4th | \u2013 |- | 1978 | Sharon Hitsman | 19-29-3 | \u2013 | T-6th | \u2013 |- | 1979 | Sharon Hitsman | 27-29-3 | \u2013 | T-4th | \u2013 |- | 1980 | Sharon Hitsman | 39-22-1 | \u2013 | T-5th | \u2013 |- | 1981 | Mary Fischl | 24-22-1 | \u2013 | T-5th | \u2013 |- | 1982 | Mary Fischl | 17\u201318 | 5-5 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1983 | Mary Fischl | 18-13 | 5-5 | 4th | \u2013 |- | 1984 | Mary Fischl | 21-9 | 6-5 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1985 | Vicki Mealer | 15-15 | 1\u20139 | 6th | \u2013 |- | 1986 | Vicki Mealer | 13\u201315 | 4\u20136 | 4th | |- | 1987 | Vicki Mealer | 20-11 | 8-4 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1988 | Vicki Mealer | 12\u201317 | 4\u20138 | 4th | \u2013 |- | 1989 | Vicki Mealer | 17-17 | 6-6 | 4th | \u2013 |- | 1990 | Vicki Mealer | 22-12 | 8-4 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1991 | Vicki Mealer | 15-12 | 6-6 | T-3rd | \u2013 |- | 1992 | | 21-11 | 7-5 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1993 | Jackie Nunez | 9\u201319 | 5\u20137 | T-4th | \u2013 |- | 1994 | Jackie Nunez | 24-11 | 8-4 | 3rd | \u2013 |- | 1995 | Jackie Nunez | 22-12 | 8-4 | T-2nd | NCAA Second Round |- | 1996 | Jackie Nunez | 7\u201325 | 3\u201317 | 10th | \u2013 |- |- ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Head Coach ! style=\"\" |Overall Record ! style=\"\" |Conference Record ! style=\"\" |Conference Standing ! style=\"\" |Postseason |- | 1997 | Jackie Nunez | 10\u201323 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 1998 | Kerry Miller | 3\u201329 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 1999 | Linda Crum | 3\u201324 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 2000 | Linda Crum | 2\u201327 | 0\u201320 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 2001 | Linda Crum | 4\u201322 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 2002 | Linda Crum | 10\u201322 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 2003 | Linda Crum | 12\u201319 | 4\u201316 | 8th | \u2013 |- | 2004 | Linda Crum | 8\u201321 | 1\u201319 | 11th | \u2013 |- | 2005 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 16-15 | 9-11 | T-6th | \u2013 |- | 2006 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 21-11 | 12-8 | T-4th | NCAA Second Round |- | 2007 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 19-14 | 11-9 | 5th | NCAA Sweet 16 |- | 2008 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 22-13 | 11-9 | T-4th | NCAA Elite 8 |- | 2009 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 27-5 | 17-3 | 2nd | NCAA Sweet 16 |- | 2010 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 20-9 | 13-7 | 3rd | NCAA First Round |- | 2011 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 25-6 | 13-3 | 2nd | NCAA Elite 8 |- | 2012 | Christy Johnson- Lynch | 22-8 | 13-3 | 2nd | NCAA Sweet 16 |- | 2013 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 18-10 | 11-5 | T-3rd | NCAA First Round |- | 2014 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 19-10 | 10-6 | T-2nd | NCAA Second Round |- | 2015 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 19-11 | 11-5 | 3rd | NCAA Second Round |- | 2016 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 18-11 | 10-6 | 3rd | NCAA First Round |- | 2017 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 22-7 | 11-5 | T-3rd | NCAA Second Round |- | 2018 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 21-13 | 9-7 | T-3rd | NIVC Champions |- | 2019 | Christy Johnson-Lynch | 17-12 | 8-8 | 4th | [NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament| NCAA First Round |-style=\"\" | Total | \u2013 | 847\u2013751-10 | 263\u2013339 | \u2013 | 22-14 |- |} ==Individual awards== === All-Americans === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ style=\"\" | All-Americans |- align=center ! style=\"\" |Year ! style=\"\" |Player ! style=\"\" |Type |- | 2006 || Erin Boeve || Honorable Mention |- | 2008 || Kaylee Manns Ashley Mass Victoria Henson || Second Team Third Team Honorable Mention |- | 2009 || Ashley Mass Kaylee Manns Victoria Henson || First Team Second Team Third Team |- | 2010 || Victoria Henson Ashley Mass Jamie Straube || First Team Third Team Honorable Mention |- | 2011 || Alison Landwehr Carly Jenson Kristen Hahn Jamie Straube || First Team Second Team Honorable Mention Honorable Mention |- | 2012 || Kristen Hahn Alison Landwehr Victoria Hurtt || Second Team Third Team Honorable Mention |- | 2013 || Kristen Hahn Mackenzie Bigbee || Second Team Honorable Mention |- | 2014 || Caitlin Nolan || Third Team |- | 2015 || Caitlin Nolan || Second Team |- | 2016 || Jess Schaben || Honorable Mention |} ==See also== *List of NCAA Division I women's volleyball programs ==References== ",
