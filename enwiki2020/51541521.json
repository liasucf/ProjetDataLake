    "text": "The 1949 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State College during the 1949 college football season. In his fifth and final year as head coach, Phil Sarboe led the team to a 2\u20136 mark in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) and 3\u20136 overall. The Cougars' four home games were played on campus in Pullman at Rogers Field, with a nearby road game in Moscow against Palouse neighbor Idaho. Washington State opened with two wins at home but ended the season on a four-game losing streak. Sarboe resigned after the season in early December, then coached at North Central High School in Spokane. He was succeeded at WSC in late January by 31-year-old Forest Evashevski, the backfield coach at Michigan State under Biggie Munn and a former back at Michigan under Fritz Crisler. ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Opponent ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | Attendance |- ! scope=\"row\" | September 17 | Utah State | Home | 33\u20130 W | 9,500 |- ! scope=\"row\" | September 24 | Montana | Home | 13\u20137 W | 7,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | October 1 | USC | Away | 7\u201335 L | 36,243 |- ! scope=\"row\" | October 8 | Oregon | Home | 0\u201321 L | 16,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | October 15 | Idaho | Away | 35\u201313 W | 21,500 |- ! scope=\"row\" | October 22 | UCLA | Home | 20\u201327 L | 21,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | October 29 | Oregon State | Away | 6\u201335 L | 15,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | November 5 | California (4) | Away | 14\u201333 L | 40,000 |- ! scope=\"row\" | November 19 | Washington | Away | 21\u201334 L | 35,000 |} ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Utah State at WSC \u2013 September 17, 1949 *Game program: Montana at WSC \u2013 September 24, 1949 *Game program: Oregon at WSC \u2013 October 8, 1949 *Game program: UCLA at WSC \u2013 October 22, 1949 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Category:1949 in Washington (state) ",
