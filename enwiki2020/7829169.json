    "text": "Jasper Redd (born June 9, 1979) is an American comedian from Knoxville, Tennessee. Jasper's brand of comedy is distinguished by his use of polyrhythmic timing. Earlier in his career, this was more pronounced. However, he currently is using more traditional cadences to appeal to a wider audience. With fellow comedian Kimberly Clark, Redd co-hosts the podcast \"The Goosedown\" on the Maximum Fun network. He has appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly, Lopez Tonight, Def Comedy Jam, Tosh.0, Jordan, Jesse, Go!, Last Comic Standing, and in the movie National Lampoon's Totally Baked: A Potumentary. He previously toured nationwide supporting Daniel Tosh on his Tosh Tour Twenty Ten. ==References== * * Jasper Redd's MySpace Profile *Jasper Redd Fansite *Cringe Humor - The West Coast Report: 1-26-04 Just For Laughs *Comedy Central - Jasper Redd *UC Santa Cruz - KZSC Laugh Riot Category:African-American comedians Category:21st-century American comedians Category:American stand-up comedians Category:Living people Category:1979 births ",
