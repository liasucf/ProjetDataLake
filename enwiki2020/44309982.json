    "text": "The Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC is a single-decker city bus produced by Alexander Dennis since 2014, as the successor to the Enviro200 midibus and Enviro300 full-size bus. The first Enviro200 MMCs entered service with National Express West Midlands in 2015. Notably, Enviro200 MMCs have been modified by Fusion Processing to be used as the basis for the first driverless bus trials in the United Kingdom. The Enviro200 MMC is available over a range of lengths between 8.9 metres and 11.7 metres, as an integral twin-axle midibus or full-size bus. Additionally, the 12.7 metre tri-axle Enviro200 XLB is offered in the New Zealand market. The Enviro200 MMC bodywork is also available as an all-electric bus, known as the Enviro200 EV, on BYD Auto's K9 chassis. == Introduction == The Enviro200 MMC can trace its lineage back to the original Dennis Dart midibus, introduced by Dennis Specialist Vehicles in 1989. One of the most successful bus models of all time, the original Dart was replaced by the low-floor Dart SLF in 1996. Through financial difficulties at the various parent companies, production of the Dart SLF passed first to TransBus International in 2001 and subsequently to Alexander Dennis in 2004. The second-generation Alexander Dennis Enviro200 - then branded as the Enviro200 Dart - was introduced as the Dart SLF's replacement in 2006, based very strongly on the design of the previous model. The third-generation Enviro200 was launched in 2009, followed by the Enviro200 MMC in 2015. Production of the classic third-generation Enviro200 ultimately ceased in late 2018. == Variants == One of Ritchies' Enviro200XLBs RT1098 seen on Rt.120 departing from Constellation Bus Station for Henderson on 17 Dec 2017. Arriva Medway Towns Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC at Chatham Waterfront bus station in 2018 Alexander Dennis unveiled Enviro200 MMC (short for Major Model Change) at the Euro Bus Expo in Birmingham in November 2014. As well as replacing the classis Enviro200, it also superseded the Enviro300. The first Enviro200 MMC entered service with National Express West Midlands in May 2015. === Enviro200 XLB === In 2017, a 12.8 metre tri-axle version of the Enviro200 MMC, known as the Enviro200 XLB, was launched for the New Zealand market. Significant investment in the vehicle type has been seen across the country, with Ritchie's Transport Holdings purchasing 28 for their Auckland operations, and Birkenhead Transport Ltd. acquiring 25 examples. === Enviro200 EV === An all- electric variant of the Enviro200 MMC, bodied onto BYD K9 chassis, was launched in 2015, named the Enviro200 EV. Following the successful trial of two integral BYD electric buses in London since 2014, Go-Ahead London ordered 51 e-buses with Enviro200 MMC body in July 2015 for use on routes 507 and 521. It was be the first time ADL have bodied a BYD product. Go-Ahead London will take delivery of a further 30 in 2018 for use on routes 153 and 214. Metroline have purchased 23 for use on route 46.\"Third BYD ADL E200 electric order for three routes\" Coach & Bus Week issue 1300 18 July 2017 page 10 Nine Enviro200 EVs were delivered to Stagecoach South for use in Guildford, England, in January 2019. These will be used on the three Guildford park and ride services, now branded as the Glide. == Operations == Stagecoach Group, Arriva UK Bus and the Go-Ahead Group have been the largest customers for the Enviro200 MMC, although the first examples entered service with National Express West Midlands in May 2015. Despite this, the bus has become first choice with many operators such as First Group, Transdev Blazefield and Wellglade Group amongst many smaller companies. === Autonomous trials === The first autonomous bus trial in the United Kingdom commenced in mid-2019, with an Enviro200 MMC modified with autonomous software from Fusion Processing able to operate in driverless mode within Stagecoach Manchester's Sharston bus depot, performing tasks such as driving to the washing station, refuelling point and then parking up at a dedicated parking space in the depot.https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/driverless-bus-stagecoach- trial-manchester-technology-sensors-a8829741.html The first passenger-carrying driverless bus trial in the United Kingdom is expected to commence by 2021, with a fleet of five identical vehicles to the Manchester trial used on a Stagecoach Fife park-and-ride route across the Forth Road Bridge, from the north bank of the Forth to Edinburgh Park station.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46309121 == See also == *List of buses == References == == External links == *Product description of Enviro200 in Alexander Dennis official website *Product description of Enviro200EV in Alexander Dennis official website Enviro200 MMC Category:Electric buses Category:Low-floor buses Category:Midibuses Category:Tri-axle buses Category:Vehicles introduced in 2014 ",
