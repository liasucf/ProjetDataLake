    "text": "Habenaria marginata (golden yellow habenaria) in Goa, India. The Orchidoideae, or the orchidoid orchids, are a subfamily of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). They typically contain the orchids with a single (monandrous), fertile anther which is erect and basitonic. The subfamily Orchidoideae and the previously recognized subfamily Spiranthoideae are considered the closest allies in the natural group of the monandrous orchids because of * a shared terrestrial habit * sectile (capable of being severed) or granular pollinia *erect anthers. The Orchidoideae contain two subclades with the following tribes : * tribes Orchideae and Diseae * tribes Cranichideae, Chloraeeae and Diurideae The former subfamily Spiranthoideae is now embedded as tribe Cranichideae in the clade of the Orchidoideae. It is sister to the tribe Diurideae. The tribe Orchideae comprises the following subtribes: * Habenariinae * Orchidinae The tribe Diseae comprises the following subtribes: * Disinae * Satyriinae The tribe Chloraeeae comprises the following subtribes: * Chloraeinae The monophyletic tribe Cranichideae comprises the following monophyletic subtribes : * Cranichidinae s.l. (including former Prescottiinae) * Galeottiellinae * Goodyerinae s.l. (including former Pachyplectroninae) * Manniellinae * Pterostylidinae * Discyphinae * Spiranthinae The tribe Diurideae comprises the following subtribes : * Acianthinae (monophyletic) * Caladeniinae (polyphyletic) * Cryptostylidinae (monophyletic) * Diuridinae (monophyletic) * Drakaeinae (monophyletic) * Prasophyllinae(monophyletic) * Thelymitrinae (monophyletic) == References == * * Pridgeon, A.M., P.J.
