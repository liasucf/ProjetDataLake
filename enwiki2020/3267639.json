    "text": "The NWA World Middleweight Championship was a professional wrestling championship in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) between 1939 and 2010. For most of its existence, it was defended in the Mexican lucha libre promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), who called it the Campeonato Mundial Peso Medio de NWA. As it is a professional wrestling championship, its holders were determined by promoters or promotions, not by athletic competition. The official middleweight limits in lucha libre are to , but this rule is broken when convenient.One example of the weight limits being ignored was El Sat\u00e1nico holding the title, despite weighing . The championship was created as the \"World Middleweight Championship\" in early 1939, by Salvador Lutteroth, owner of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). He awarded it to Gus Kallio, a five-time National Wrestling Association World Middleweight Champion, nicknamed \"The King of the Middleweights\" in the United States. When Octavio Gaona defeated Kallio on March 29, 1939, he won both middleweight championships. The National Wrestling Association title was retired in 1940, to give prominence to Lutteroth's creation. When EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1952, the belt was prefixed with \"NWA\". In the late 1980s, EMLL withdrew from the NWA and in the early 1990s changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). CMLL retained ownership of three NWA-branded championships which originated in the promotion. The other two were the NWA World Welterweight Championship and the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. All continued to be billed as \"Campeonatos de NWA\". In 1994, \u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n bought the NWA World Middleweight Championship and its booking rights from CMLL. He chose to make himself first champion, and won it in a match with Coraz\u00f3n de Le\u00f3n at a Wrestle and Romance (WAR) show on November 8, 1994, in Korakuen Hall. At that point he began promoting the title exclusively in Japan, holding it himself until vacating it in 1998. During his run with the championship \u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n also won the J-Crown championships, eight unified lightweight championships, but the NWA World Middleweight Championship was never integrated into the J-Crown. In 2003, after ending The Great Sasuke's long reign, Drag\u00f3n signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and returned the championship to CMLL who he worked with off and on until that point. Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant title in its first CMLL match since 1994. In March 2010, Blue Demon Jr., the president of NWA Mexico the local representative of the National Wrestling Alliance, demanded that CMLL (a non-member of NWA Mexico) cease promoting the NWA-branded championships, declaring that all three championships had been vacated as far as the NWA was concerned. NWA Mexico had already tried to reclaim CMLL's three NWA-branded titles on a previous occasion. CMLL ignored both requests; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented instead that \"the titles belong to CMLL\", thus the NWA could not vacate them. On August 12, 2010, CMLL unveiled the new NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to replace the original championship, which it conceded to NWA Mexico. Since 1939 45 wrestlers have shared 84 NWA Middleweight Championship reigns. Ren\u00e9 Guajardo held the championship a record six times. Tarz\u00e1n L\u00f3pez' four reigns totalled 2,948 days, the longest of any champion. The Great Sasuke had the longest single reign, at 1,548 days. Emilio Charles, Jr. had the shortest reign at 11 days. ==Title history== ==Reigns by combined length== alt=A color photograph of a Japanese man in a black mask with a white front and red and blue markings pointing at the camera alt=A color photograph of a Japanese wrestler wearing a light blue mask, cape and trunks posing on a turnbuckle with his hands in the air alt=A color photograph of a Caucasian wrestler smiling as he leans back against the ropes. ;Key {| class=\"wikitable\" |style=\"background: #f0f0f0;\"|Symbol |style=\"background: #f0f0f0;\"|Meaning |- |style=\"background- color:#bbeeff\"|\u00a4 |The exact length of at least one title reign is uncertain, so the shortest possible length is used. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" ! scope=\"col\" |Rank ! scope=\"col\" |Wrestler ! scope=\"col\" |No. of reigns ! scope=\"col\" |Combined days ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- !scope=\"row\" |1 | || 4 || || |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" !scope=\"row\" | 2 | || 6 ||| || |- !scope=\"row\" | 3 | Great Sasuke || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 4 | || 1 || || |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" !scope=\"row\" | 5 | || 2 || || |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" !scope=\"row\" | 6 | An\u00edbal || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 7 | Averno || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 8 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 9 | Atlantis || 3 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 10 | Rayo de Jalisco || 3 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 11 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 12 | M\u00edstico || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 13 | || 3 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 14 | || || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 15 | || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 16 | Kung Fu || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 17 | Black Warrior || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 18 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 19 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 20 | || || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 21 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 22 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 23 | || 3 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 24 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 25 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 26 | || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 27 | Gran Cochisse || 3 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 28 | Sangre Chicana || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 29 | Mano Negra || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 30 | || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 31 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 32 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 33 | Lizmark || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 34 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 35 | || 2 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 36 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 37 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 38 | Gran Hamada || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 39 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 40 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 41 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 42 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 43 | || 1 || || |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" !scope=\"row\" | 44 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 45 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 46 | || 1 || || |- !scope=\"row\" | 47 | Oro || 1 || || |-style=\"background-color:#bbeeff\" !scope=\"row\" | 48 | || 1 || || |} ==Footnotes== ==See also== *List of National Wrestling Alliance championships ==References== ;General source [G] - ;Specific ==External links== * * NWA Title Histories Category:Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre championships Category:National Wrestling Alliance championships Category:Middleweight wrestling championships Category:World professional wrestling championships ",
