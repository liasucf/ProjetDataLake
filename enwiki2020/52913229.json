As they clash, we learn the truth about who killed Igor's sister and begin to understand the depth of the hatred between the two. Nadya must continue to fight to prove her innocence as well as to expose the corrupt business empire that Irina's family have built their name on. The serial starts from the point when Nadya escapes from the jail and reaches the place where Irina's wedding was to be held and tries to make her confess for her wrong deeds on the terrace. Just then Igor comes on the terrace and tells Nadya to leave Irina. In the hustle, Nadya falls off the terrace. Both Irina and Nadya are taken to hospital where Nadya is again sent to jail and her punishment was increased by 2 years. After completing her imprisonment, she makes her mind to take revenge from Irina's family . She is now living with her friend Katya. Katya was with her since she was in prison. They joined a company \"Bori link\" a telecom service provider company with the help of Oleg, Igor's step brother who is a good friend of Boris, the owner of Bori link. Boris was also the fianc\u00e9 of Igor's sister Margarita Panin who died in a car accident. Boris didn't like Nadya in the beginning as he considers her the murderer of his beloved girlfriend Rita but soon Nadya wins his trust and makes him believe that she isn't the murderer and also helps Boris to take Bori link to new heights. She becomes a star after featuring in a TV advertisement of Bori link and she then decides that it is the right time to join \"PAN Cosmetics\" again. (It is the same company which humiliated her in a case of Confidential Data Transfer to the rival company which was again done by Irina but she framed and accused Nadya for this case). Oleg falls in love with Nadya and helps her in her painful years by hiding his identity with the name of \"Ham\". Irina is trying to send Nadya back to prison through her smart tricks and Nadya is continuously giving response to her in an equally smart manner. Nadya is now more determined because of the push she got from her mother's death. Soon Irina's grandmother Tamara learns that Nadya's son Yaroslav was illegally adopted by a family and they're currently living in Montenegro which is again a plan and conspiracy of Irina. Meanwhile, Anastasia Sturva, an investor in PAN Cosmetics and also the real mother of Igor joins hands with Nadya in her revenge plans. Now Irina sees everything loose through her hands as Nadya's son Yaroslav returns and is staying at her grandmother Tamara's house. Meanwhile, Igor finds a pendant ring in his room which he'd given to Nadya when he'd proposed her. He asks about it to Irina but she again lies about it and says that Nadya gave her that ring. Igor doesn't believe it and asks the truth about that ring to Nadya. When asked by Igor about that ring, Nadya refuses that she ever gave it to Irina. After that Nadya clearly understands that she'd given this ring to his son and now it's confirmed that Irina was the real murderer of his son.
