    "text": "Caldas da Rainha () is a medium-sized city in western central Portugal in the historical province of Estremadura and the district of Leiria. The city serves as the seat of the larger municipality of the same name and of the Comunidade Intermunicipal do Oeste (OesteCIM, Intermunicipal Community of the West). At the 2011 census, the municipality had a population of 51,729 in an area of , with 30,343 residing in the city. Although the city itself lies about inland, three of the municipality's civil parishes lie on the Atlantic Ocean. Caldas da Rainha is best known for its sulphurous hot springs and ceramic pottery. The settlement was founded in the 15th century by Queen Leonor (Rainha Dona Leonor), who established a hospital and a church at the site of some therapeutic hot springs. The Hospital Termal Rainha D. Leonor (Queen Leonor Spring Water Hospital, or Thermal Hospital) is the oldest purpose-built institution of its kind in the world, with five centuries of history. The city's name, often shortened to simply \"Caldas\", can be translated as \"Queen's Hot Springs\", \"Queen's Spa\", or \"Queen's Baths\". Caldas da Rainha is a UNESCO Creative City. It is home to many cultural institutions. The city's nine museums cover art, history, and cycling. Cultural and sports venues include Centro Cultural e de Congressos (CCC, Cultural and Conference Centre), a centre for performing arts, exhibitions, and conferences; Expoeste \u2013 Centro de Exposi\u00e7\u00f5es do Oeste (Exhibition Centre of the West), which hosts exhibitions and festivals; a bullring; several football (soccer) pitches; and a multi- sport municipal complex. Caldas hosts six professional and higher-educational institutions, including a major arts and design school and a school devoted to ceramics. In 2014 Caldas da Rainha had the best public secondary school in Portugal based on national test scores. == History == contemporaneous portrait of Queen Leonor by Jos\u00e9 Malhoa === Early years === Caldas da Rainha was part of the ancient region Lusitania, inhabited by ancient Romans who took advantage of sulphurous waters sprouting in the region. Barbarian invasions destroyed most of the Roman-built baths. By the 13th century, the springs were known as \"caldas de \u00d3bidos\", after the nearby town. At this time, a Benedictine order looked after the needs of the poor and cared for the lepers and rheumatics, who sought the healing waters. With the disbandment of the order by the 15th century, the area fell into disrepair. Queen Leonor (Rainha Dona Leonor, in Portuguese), the wife of King Jo\u00e3o II, is credited as the founder of Caldas da Rainha. One day in 1484, while traveling from \u00d3bidos to Batalha, she happened upon a group of peasants bathing in foul-smelling waters by the roadside. The queen stopped to inquire about this oddity, and the bathers told her that the waters possessed curative powers. She decided to try them and was pleased to find that she was quickly relieved of an unknown affliction that she had been suffering. On that site, the queen ordered a hospital built so that others could enjoy the same relief. Construction began the following year, and although the first patients were admitted in 1488, the works were not completed until about 1496 or 1497. To finance the hospital and its adjoining church, the queen sold her jewels and used income from her landholdings. The name of the settlement that grew around the site and became Caldas da Rainha refers to both its founder and the reason for its existence. The city's name can be translated as \"Queen's Hot Springs\", \"Queen's Spa\", or \"Queen's Baths\". The settlement's waters remain its major claim to fame. On 21 March 1511, King Manuel I, brother of Queen Leonor, conferred the status of town (vila) upon Caldas da Rainha. In 1821, it was made a municipality (concelho or munic\u00edpio). === Twentieth century === In 1901 and 1902, Caldas da Rainha welcomed 350 Boer men, women, and children who sought refuge from the ravages of the Second Boer War in their South African homeland. Initially housed in the thermal hospital, the refugees were transferred to the park pavilions at the onset of the bathing season. Some rented rooms in town, marveling at the low rates. During World War I, in which Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas had one of three internment camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15\u201345 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilh\u00f5es do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, after the end of the war. On 26 April 1919, President Jo\u00e3o do Canto e Castro granted the town the title of Dame of the Military Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit (Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada do Valor, Lealdade e M\u00e9rito). Unlike other places similarly honoured, Caldas did not add the honour's collar to its coat of arms. The town was elevated to the status of city (cidade) in August 1927. During World War II, in which Portugal remained neutral, hundreds of Jewish refugees came to Caldas da Rainha to escape Nazism. Caldas also served as home to British and American airmen who landed or crashed in Portugal or off its coast. In January 1943, 230 Britons resident in Axis power Italy were evacuated to Caldas, where they were expected to stay until the end of the war. Most of these evacuees were over 65 years of age and had resided in Italy for a long time. In a prelude to the Carnation Revolution, in the early morning of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Ex\u00e9rcito), attempted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat against the country's authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00 a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval. The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00 a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00 p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, 40 days later. === Symbols === Caldas da Rainha's coat of arms was granted by Queen Leonor, before municipal coats of arms were typically used in Portugal. The centre of the city's arms consist of the queen's personal arms, flanked on the right by a shrimping net, to commemorate the fishermen who rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso, and on the left a pelican feeding its young, a symbol of her husband, King Jo\u00e3o II. Because of its early introduction, several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards. The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a purple and yellow gyronny. The municipality adopted a logo for marketing purposes, to project an image of \"relevant historical tradition\", \"current dynamism\", and \"enormous potential in culture, economy, commerce, and tourism\". The logo shows a stylised outline of Queen Leonor's crowned head in blue tones, representing the city's historical connection with water. Below the queen's image, the municipality's name appears in all caps in Eras Light. Below this \"C\u00e2mara Municipal\" is written in Gill Sans. == Geography == Caldas da Rainha, often shortened to just \"Caldas\", is located in western central Portugal at .

Juni 1884Galerie Sevogel: Historische Wertpapiere Volume 3. NZZ Verlag, 1984, p.54f () Examples of typical pottery from Caldas da Rainha Caldas da Rainha is well known for its glazed ceramic pottery (lou\u00e7a das Caldas). The New York Times has called Caldas \"[t]he capital of Portuguese pottery\". The city is at \"the center of a region rich in clay\", where pottery has been made since the Neolithic Era. Caldas gained fame for its ceramic wares when Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and his brother Feliciano founded their F\u00e1brica de Faian\u00e7as, now called Faian\u00e7as Art\u00edsticas Bordallo Pinheiro. The factory's output includes large decorative pieces; tableware shaped like fruits, vegetables, and animals; and figurines of Z\u00e9 Povinho, a bearded peasant everyman character. Caldas has a tradition of ceramic phalluses dating to the late 19th century. Caldas has a tradition of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets. Caldas has several traditional sweets. Cavacas das Caldas are a small-bowl- sized, concave confection of flour and eggs, with a crunchy sugar covering. In June 2005, a pyramid containing 48,900 cavacas was erected on Pra\u00e7a 25 de Abril in front of the city hall. Beijinhos das Caldas (\"little kisses\") are similar, but are smaller and spherical. Other local sweets include trouxas de ovos (poached eggs), lampreias de ovos (egg lampreys), and p\u00e3o-de-l\u00f3 do Landal (Landal sponge cake). Savory dishes typical of Caldas include ensopado de enguias da lagoa (stewed lagoon eels), bacalhau \u00e0 lagareiro (cod in olive oil), polvo \u00e0 lagareiro (octopus in olive oil), and fatias de carne frita \u00e0 moda do Landal (Landal-style sliced fried meat). == Attractions == === City === Igreja de Nossa Senhora do P\u00f3pulo (Church of Our Lady of the Populace) Pavilh\u00f5es do Parque in Parque D.

Rede Nacional de Expressos provides express bus service to various destinations within Portugal. Rodovi\u00e1ria do Tejo (also known as Rodotejo) provides interurban services to the cities, towns, villages, and hamlets near and around Caldas. Rodotejo also provides three R\u00e1pida (literally \"rapid\", express-like, limited-stop) services from Caldas, serving Campo Grande in Lisbon, \u00d3bidos, and Bombarral (R\u00e1pida Verde, Green Rapid); Leiria, S\u00e3o Martinho do Porto, and Nazar\u00e9 (R\u00e1pida Rosa, Pink Rapid); and Santar\u00e9m and Rio Maior (R\u00e1pida Caldas da Rainha\u2013Santar\u00e9m).
