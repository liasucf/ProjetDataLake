    "text": "Philippine Wrestling Revolution (PWR) is an independent professional wrestling promotion based in the Philippines. PWR was founded in December 2013. ==History== Professional wrestling in the Philippines started in 1989 through the short-lived show called \"Pinoy Wrestling\". It aired on national television via PTV-4, with character actor Johnny Revilla as host and ringside reporter comedian Jimmy Fabregas. Its roster consisted of locally trained wrestlers such as Joe Pogi, King Cobra, Macho Franco, Caloy Bakal, and Max Buwaya. There were also tag teams such as The Smoky Mountain Brothers, The Bakal Boys, and Dr. Q\u2019s henchmen The Brusko Brothers, Kamikaze Kid and Roboto. Women wrestlers like Aerobica and Pinay Wonder and midgets such as The Mikrobyos and The Tureritos were also featured. Other wrestlers include Juan Duwag, Waway The Wild Man, Turko Turero, Pinoy Ranger, Sultan Bato, Iggy Igorot, Lawin and Zorro. The show was discontinued in the early part of 1990. In 2012, the idea of forming PWR was born in a Facebook group. Wrestling fans from different parts of the country linked up and were added to the group to establish a wrestling company, discuss fantasy bookings, and conceptualize characters and gimmicks. This came about despite pro wrestling not being as popular in the Philippines since the end of the WWE Attitude Era in the late 1990s and early 2000s as well as the exposure of kayfabe. The upstart promotion got an assist from veteran American pro wrestler Joe E. Legend, who helped them in the preparations. Sometime between late 2013 and early 2014, the group was contacted by a Japanese promoter Ankei Tamashiro doing a show in the Philippines for WNC-Reina, where two of the main attractions were former WWE and ECW superstar Tajiri and half-Filipina triple crown champion Shuri Kondo. The Japanese promoter's representative in Manila found PWR's Facebook page and asked the group to assist them in setting up and promoting the show in the country. These events further encouraged the group to pursue the idea of setting up the first-ever wrestling promotion in the country. The pioneer batch of aspiring professional wrestlers were officially trained by an American pro wrestler who goes by the name of Josh Bauserman, whom they met in Manila during the early stages of planning. The founders credit Bauserman for teaching them everything about pro wrestling, from in-ring maneuvers to backstage activities. PWR has expanded its reach within the international community with international wrestlers such as Billy Suede and Koto Hiro performing for circuit while its own roster of wrestlers participates in inter-promotional matches abroad. In 2017, WWE officials were in attendance during PWR Live: Bagong Yugto solidifying PWR's presence in the international community.https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/160545-pwr- live-bagong-yugto-wrestling-review-seizing-moment-wwe ==Events== The promotion held its inaugural event called Renaissance on September 27, 2014, at the Makati Cinema Square Arena, Makati City. PWR then held subsequent events to complete its calendar: Terminus, Vendetta, Path of Gold, and Wrevolution X, which is considered to be PWR's WrestleMania equivalent. On August 15, 2015, PWR held an event called PWR Live, still at the Makati Cinema Square Arena. Multiple events named PWR Live have been staged since. To date, 2 PWR shows have been aired on television (on tape delay) via TV5: Terminus (2014) and PWR Live (August 2015) On February 5, 2016, PWR held a house show at the LBD Sports Arena in Candelaria, Quezon, its first outside Metro Manila. ===List of events=== ====2014==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:490px;\"| Main event |- |Renaissance | |rowspan=2|Makati Square Arena |rowspan=2|Makati City |\"The Senyorito\" Jake de Leon vs. \"Classical\" Bryan Leo |- |Terminus | |Bombay Suarez and Jake de Leon vs. Bryan Leo and Main Maxx |} ====2015==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:490px;\"| Main event |- |Vendetta | |rowspan=4|Makati Square Arena |rowspan=4|Makati City |Jake de Leon vs. Chris Panzer |- |Wrevolution X | |Jake de Leon vs. Bombay Suarez for the inaugural PWR Championship Jake de Leon (c) vs Bryan Leo (Bryan Leo cashes in his title opportunity as promised by Mr. Sy) |- |PWR Live | |Bryan Leo (c) vs Jake de Leon for the PWR Championship |- |Renaissance | |Bryan Leo (c) vs. Jake de Leon vs. The Apocalypse for the PWR Championship |- |PWR Live | |rowspan=2|iAcademy Auditorium |rowspan=2|Makati City |\"The Social Media Sinister\" Ken Warren (c) vs. Chris Panzer for the PHX Championship |- |Terminus | |Bryan Leo (c) vs. Ralph Imabayashi for the PWR Championship |} ====2016==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:490px;\"| Main event |- |PWR Live: Road to Vendetta | |iAcademy Auditorium |Makati City |Ralph Imabayashi (c) vs. The Apocalypse in an open challenge for the PWR Championship |- |PWR on Tour: Quezon Invasion (house show) | |LDB Sports Arena |Candelaria, Quezon |Ralph Imabayashi (c) vs. Peter Versoza in an open challenge for the PWR Championship |- |Vendetta | |iAcademy Auditorium |Makati City |Ralph Imabayashi (c) vs. Bryan Leo for the PWR Championship |- |PWR Live: Manila Madness | |Tanduay Covered Court |Manila |Ken Warren (c) vs Bombay Suarez vs Chris Panzer for the PHX Championship |- |PWR Live: Road to Wrevolution X | |BF Homes Covered Court |Para\u00f1aque City |The Royal Flush vs Jake de Leon, Ralph Imabayashi and Chris Panzer |- |Wrevolution X | |iAcademy Auditorium |Makati City |Bryan Leo (c) vs Jake de Leon vs Ralph Imabayashi for the PWR Championship |- |PWR on Tour: Batanes Beatdown (house show) |June 24, 2016 | |Batanes |Jake de Leon (c) vs Bryan Leo vs The Apocalypse for the PWR Championship |- |PWR Live: The ShawDown |July 30, 2016 |500 Shaw Zentrum Events Pavilion |Mandaluyong City |Jake de Leon vs Main Maxx in a non-title PWR Champion vs PHX Champion challenge |- |PWR at Asia Pop Comic Con 2016 (house show)http://www.pwrcentral.com/asia-pop-comic-con-results/ |August 26\u201328, 2016 |SMX Convention Center |Pasay City |Day 1: Jake de Leon (c) vs Ralph Imabayashi for the PWR Championship Day 2: Jake de Leon (c) vs Ken Warren for the PWR Championship Day 3: Jake de Leon (c) vs The Apocalypse for the PWR Championship |- |Renaissance |October 8, 2016 |rowspan=2|Bayanihan Center |rowspan=2|Pasig City |Jake de Leon (c) vs John Sebastian for the PWR Championship |- |PWR Live: Suplex Sunday |November 13, 2016 |Jake de Leon (c) vs John Sebastian in a Bacolod Bullrope Match for the PWR Championship |} ====2017==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font- size:85%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:490px;\"| Main event |- |PWR Live: Bagong Yugto | |Venue 142 Events Place |Quezon City |John Sebastian (c) vs Jake de Leon for the PWR Championship |- |Path of Gold | |rowspan=3|Bayanihan Center |rowspan=3|Pasig City |20-person Path of Gold Match.
