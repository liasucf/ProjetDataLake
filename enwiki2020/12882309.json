The castle had been the hereditary seat of the Scotts of Buccleuch since the 15th century, and it was the centre of power in Upper Teviotdale, on one of the main historic routes south towards England. The original tower house was burned in 1532 by the Earl of Northumberland, and it was blown up in 1570 by the Earl of Surrey. ==Branxholme Easter Loch and Wester Loch== The Easter Loch lies 2 miles west of Branxholme, and its outlet is the Newmill Burn. ==See also== *List of places in the Scottish Borders *List of places in Scotland ==External links== *SCRAN image of Branxholme Castle *RCAHMS / Canmore record for Branxholme Castle / Twentyfoot Tower *SCRAN Pathfinder Pack: Family Names: SCOTT *Gazetteer for Scotland: Branxholme Castle *Gazetteer for Scotland: Branxholme Easter Loch Category:Villages in the Scottish Borders ",
