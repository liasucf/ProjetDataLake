In the Book of Judges, God delivers the Israelites into his hand for eight years (Judges 3:8) as a punishment for polytheism. However, when the people of Israel \"cried out to the Lord\", He saved them through Othniel, son of Kenaz (Judges 3:9). 'Cushan' or 'Chushan' may indicate Cushite origins. 'Rishathaim' means 'double-wickedness'(\"resha\" \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 - \"evil\" or \"wickedness\" + \"im\" \u05d9\u05d9\u05dd - doubling suffix). The latter was likely a pejorative appellation used by his Hebrew foes, rather than what this King called himself. Use of it may indicate that the Hebrews had concrete reasons to bear him a grudge, beyond the meager information given in the surviving Biblical textGrace Baptist Church: Judges 3:7-11 . ==References== Category:Monarchs of the Hebrew Bible Category:Aramean kings Category:Book of Judges ",
