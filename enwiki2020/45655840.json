The Nature Park Way, which links five nature parks in Schleswig-Holstein for ramblers, runs over the Aschberg. Since 1930, the 7-metre-high Bismarck statue has stood on the Aschberg. Following a resolution by the Knivsberg Gesellschaft, it was salvaged in 1919 from the alcove of the Bismarck tower on the Knivsberg near Apenrade in North Schleswig. The statue, based on a design by sculptor, Adolf Br\u00fctt, was made by the Berlin metal sculptor, Gustav Lind, in copper repouss\u00e9 work. In the late 19th century an observation tower, made of wood, was first erected on the highest point, but it was replaced by a newer wooden tower after just a few years. This roughly 10-metre-high tower was called the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Turm (Emperor William Tower). It existed until 1918.www.Kultfeinwerk.de , retrieved 23 July 2010 In 2012 and 2013 the roughly 10 hectare area on the Aschberg was remodelled at a cost of 11 million euros. After three years of planning and 18 months of construction, a hotel was built with 30 double rooms, a seminar building with restaurant and a roughly 20-metre-high observation and climbing tower.
