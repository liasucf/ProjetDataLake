    "text": "\"\u00a1Salve, Oh Patria!\" (, ) is the national anthem of Ecuador. The lyrics were written in 1865 by the poet Juan Le\u00f3n Mera, under request of the Ecuadorian Senate; the music was composed by Antonio Neumane. However, it was not officially adopted by the Congress until September 29, 1948.Presidency of Ecuador It consists of a chorus and six verses, of which only the second verse and the chorus (before and after the verse) are actually sung. The verses are marked by a strong anti-Spanish sentiment and narrate the failed 1809 uprising against Bonapartist Spain and the 1820\u20131822 Ecuadorian War of Independence. ==History== Abridged sub-90 second rendition featuring only the instrumental introductory section and chorus; this arrangement is commonly played at public events like soccer games where a full performance would be impracticable. From 1830 to 1832, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo wrote a national anthem (chorus and four verses) as an homage to the nascent Ecuadorian state. This composition, suggested by General Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores, was not set to music and did not gain popularity. In 1833, a hymn titled \"Canci\u00f3n Ecuatoriana\" (), of six verses, was published in the Gaceta del Gobierno del Ecuador No. 125 of December 28. A composition date of 1830 was given, but most historians do not consider this definitive, because it was by an anonymous author. In 1838, a Canci\u00f3n Nacional (National Song), of a chorus and six verses, appeared included in the pamphlet Poes\u00edas by General Flores, which was published by the Government Press. In a later editions, there were changes to the third verse. Even so, for historians, it is the second Canci\u00f3n Nacional that is known. In 1865, the Argentine musician Juan Jos\u00e9 Allende, in collaboration with the Ecuadorian Army, presented to the National Congress a musical project for the lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo, but it was not well received. In November of this year, at the express request of the president of the Senate, Nicol\u00e1s Espinosa, the Ambate\u00f1o poet Juan Le\u00f3n Mera Mart\u00ednez, who was then the secretary of the Senate, wrote and submitted the lyrics of the National Anthem. These lyrics were then sent, with Congressional approval, to Guayaquil, so that Antonio Neumane would set them to music. This is the hymn that would later be officialized as the definitive national anthem. On January 16, 1866, the complete version of the lyrics by Juan Le\u00f3n Mera were published in the Quite\u00f1o weekly El Sud Americano. In 1870, the national anthem premiered in the Plaza Grande (Plaza de la Independencia facing the Palacio de Gobierno), performed by the 2nd Battalion and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda L\u00edrica de Pablo Ferreti, directed by Antonio Neumane. The music was in the key of C flat major. The current introduction of 16 measures was composed by Domingo Brescia and Enrique Marconi in 1901. Today, the hymn is performed in the key of E major from 2001 onward. In 1913, the Guayaquile\u00f1o writer and diplomat V\u00edctor Manuel Rend\u00f3n submitted a new hymn with lyrics adapted from the music of Antonio Neumane, but ultimately the Legislature rejected the proposal. As a full performance can last up to three minutes, in many instances only a sub-90 second rendition of the chorus is performed at public events like soccer games.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo1--qVaq14 ==Lyrics== ===Official lyrics=== {|class=\"wikitable\" align=center rules=\"cols\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Spanish lyrics !English translation |- |'''''' \u00a1Salve, Oh Patria, mil veces! \u00a1Oh Patria, gloria a ti! \u00a1Gloria a ti!

Ya tu pecho rebosa gozo y paz, y tu frente radiosa m\u00e1s que el sol contemplamos lucir. I Indignados tus hijos del yugo que te impuso la ib\u00e9rica audacia, de la injusta y horrenda desgracia que pesaba fatal sobre ti, santa voz a los cielos alzaron, voz de noble y sin par juramento, de vengarte del monstruo sangriento, de romper ese yugo servil. II '''' Los primeros, los hijos del suelo que, soberbio, el Pichincha decora, te aclamaron por siempre se\u00f1ora y vertieron su sangre por t\u00ed. Dios mir\u00f3 y acept\u00f3 el holocausto y esa sangre fue germen fecundo de otros h\u00e9roes que at\u00f3nito el mundo vi\u00f3 en tu torno a millares surgir. III De estos h\u00e9roes al brazo del hierro nada tuvo invencible la tierra, y del valle a la alt\u00edsima sierra se escuchaba el fragor de la lid. Tras la lid, la victoria volaba, libertad tras el triunfo ven\u00eda, y al le\u00f3n destrozado se o\u00eda de impotencia y despecho rugir. IV Cedi\u00f3 al fin la fiereza espa\u00f1ola, y hoy, oh Patria, tu libre existencia es la noble y magn\u00edfica herencia que nos dio el hero\u00edsmo feliz. De las manos paternas la hubimos, nadie intente arranc\u00e1rnosla ahora, ni nuestra ira excitar vengadora quiera, necio o audaz, contra s\u00ed. V Nadie, oh Patria, lo intente. Las sombras de tus h\u00e9roes gloriosos nos miran, y el valor y el orgullo que inspiran son augurios de triunfos por ti. Venga el hierro y el plomo fulm\u00edneo, que a la idea de guerra y venganza se despierta la heroica pujanza que hizo al fiero espa\u00f1ol sucumbir. VI Y si nuevas cadenas prepara la injusticia de b\u00e1rbara suerte, \u00a1gran Pichincha! prev\u00e9n t\u00fa la muerte de la Patria y sus hijos al fin Hunde al punto en tus hondas entra\u00f1as cuanto existe en tu tierra, el tirano huelle solo cenizas y en vano busque rastro de ser junto a ti. |'''''' We greet you, Oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, glory to you! Your breast overflows with joy and peace, and your radiant face is brighter than the shining sun we see. I Your children were outraged by the yoke That Iberian audacity imposed on you, By the unjust and horrendous disgrace Fatally weighing upon you. They cried out a holy voice to the heavens, that noble voice of a unbreakable pledge, to defeat that monster of blood, that this servile yoke would disappear. II The first sons of the soil Which Pichincha adorns proudly, They declared you as their sovereign lady forever, And shed their blood for you. God observed and accepted the holocaust, And that blood was the prolific seed Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment Saw rise up around you by the thousands. III Of those heroes of iron arm No land was invincible, And from the valley to the highest sierra You could hear the roar of the fray. After the fray, Victory would fly, Freedom after the triumph would come, And the Lion was heard broken With a roar of helplessness and despair. IV At last Spanish ferocity yielded, And now, oh Fatherland, your free existence Is the noble and magnificent heritage Which the felicitous heroism gave us.: It was given to us from our Fathers' hands, Let no one take it from us now, Nor any daring fool wish to excite Our vengeful anger against himself. V May no one, oh Fatherland, try it. The shadows of Your glorious heroes watch us, And the valor and pride that they inspire Are omens of victories for you. Come lead and the striking iron, That the idea of war and revenge Wakes the heroic strength That made the fierce Spanish succumb. VI And if new chains are prepared by The barbaric injustice of fate, Great Pichincha! May you prevent the death Of the country and their children in the end; Sink to the deep point in your gut All that exists on your soil. Let the tyrant Tread only ashes and in vain Look for any trace of being beside you. |} ==References== ==External links== * Ecuadorian national anthem Category:National anthems Category:Ecuadorian music Category:National symbols of Ecuador Category:South American anthems Category:National anthem compositions in E major ",
