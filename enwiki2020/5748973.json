    "text": "\"The Last Time\" is the first single from Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's third English solo-album I Stand Alone, released in 1987. \"The Last Time\" was released as both 7 and 12 inch singles, as well as a 3-inch CD. The latter two also featured an extended version of the song. The song contained a different sound from F\u00e4ltskog's previous work due to the West Coast American influences of the producers, Peter Cetera and Bruce Gaitsch. Despite a modern sound and a well- known producer, the single was not a resounding success. F\u00e4ltskog did promote the song, including visiting London in February 1988, but the single only reached No.77 in the UK. In The Netherlands, where F\u00e4ltskog traditionally had a large fan base, the single peaked at No. 18. For the South American market, F\u00e4ltskog recorded a Spanish version of \"The Last Time\" called \"La \u00daltima Vez\". This version also appeared on the South American version of the album and is considered to be a rare recording. In 1993 Mark Free covered this song and it is on his album Long Way From Love. ==Formats and track listings== *7\"-single # \"The Last Time\" [Album-Version] 4:15 # \"Are You Gonna Throw It All Away\" 4:55 *12\"-single/3\"-CD-single # \"The Last Time\" [Extended Version] 6:52 # \"The Last Time\" [Album-Version] 4:12 # \"Are You Gonna Throw It All Away\" 4:55 ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1987) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ==External links== *\"The Last Time\" Official Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog website. ==References== Category:1987 singles Category:Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog songs Category:1987 songs Category:Warner Music Group singles ",
