    "text": "\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\" is a show tune from the 1943 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma!. The piece was part of trumpeter Miles Davis's repertoire in the 1950s, which probably motivated other jazz musicians to play it. ==In other media== The song was adapted into a 1993 children's picture book of the same name, illustrated by James Warhola. A karaoke rendition is performed in the 1989 film When Harry Met Sally..., sung by Billy Crystal (Harry) and Meg Ryan (Sally). ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics Category:1943 songs Category:1940s jazz standards Category:Songs with music by Richard Rodgers Category:Songs with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II Category:Songs from Oklahoma!
