    "text": "The England Deaf team consists of players who are Deaf. The England Deaf cricket team is organised and run by the England and Wales Cricket Board on behalf of the England Cricket Association for the Deaf. At a grassroots level in England, Deaf cricketers can play for county and other Deaf teams as long as they require a hearing aid for both ears. This has greatly enabled Deaf cricket to grow quickly since 2013. At the end of 2017 there were over 300 known Deaf cricketers, an increase of nearly 300% over the past 4 years. == 2018 England Deaf Cricket Squad == James Schofield (capt) Umesh Valjee Andrew Wood Darrell Sykes Dean Bedford Farooq Mohammed George Greenway Jake Oakes James Dixon Joel Harris Luke Hughes Matty Bailey Mike Weathersby Moazzam Rashid Nathan Caddell Stephen George == References == == External links == *official website C Category:Deaf cricket teams Category:Deaf culture in the United Kingdom Deaf cricket team Category:Disability organisations based in England ",
