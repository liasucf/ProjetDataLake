    "text": "Omar Rodriguez is the self-titled second studio album by The Mars Volta guitarist Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez and the first in the \"Amsterdam series\" (written and recorded in the city in early June 2005). Most of the overdubs and mixing were done on the road in September 2005. Gold Standard Laboratories began offering a limited edition vinyl picture disc of this release for mail order in December 2006. The Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quintet, which formed in unison with the release of this record, toured briefly in the Netherlands in the fall of 2005 in support of this new release. Joining then on stage for one performance was Damo Suzuki, for the song \"Please Heat This Eventually\" which would resurface on the next two releases from the group. The centerpiece of the album, Jacob van Lennepkade (which was later reworked on The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange) is named after the street in which Omar lived during its recording in Amsterdam. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez \u2013 guitar, sitar, bass, gong, percussion *Adri\u00e1n Terrazas-Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 saxophone, bass clarinet, percussion *Marcel Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez \u2013 drums, keyboards, gong, percussion *Juan Alderete \u2013 bass (2) *Jon Debaun \u2013 recording engineer, bass (3) *Cedric Bixler-Zavala \u2013 tambora (4) *Eric Salas \u2013 drums (5) ==References== Category:2005 albums Category:Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez albums Category:Albums produced by Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez ",
