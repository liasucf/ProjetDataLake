It originally opened in 1880 as the Grand Hotel d'Italie Bauer- Gr\u00fcnwald and moved to its current location in 1902. The rooms in the modern section are marketed under the Bauer name, while those in the older section are marketed as the Bauer Palazzo. The Bauer group also owns several other hotels in Venice: the Bauer Casa Nova, adjacent to the hotel on the Campo San Mois\u00e8;Bauer Casa Nova and the Bauer Palladio and Villa F, on the Giudecca facing San Marco across the Giudecca Canal. ==History== The hotel was founded by an Italian, Mr. Bauer, a director of Venice's Hotel de la Ville, and an Austrian, Julius or Giulio Gr\u00fcnwald, who married Bauer's daughter. In 1930, Gr\u00fcnwald's heirs sold the hotel to Arnaldo Bennati, a Ligurian shipbuilder.
