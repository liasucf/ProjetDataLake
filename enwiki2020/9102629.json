Also, Rivals had him ranked as the 53rd best prospect coming from Florida in 2005, and future teammate Quarterback Jarrett Brown was ranked 66th on the list. He received offers from schools such as Florida, Miami (Fla.), Georgia, West Virginia, Kansas State, Clemson, and NC State. But was considering being in a \"package deal\" with his best friend Conredge Collins, whom later went to rival Pitt. In November 2004, Andrews narrowed his list down to his top five schools, which were: Florida, Miami (Fla.), Georgia, West Virginia, and Kansas State. Then in January 2005 it was announced that he had narrowed his list down to two schools, Florida and West Virginia.

He had also decided that he needed to change, because he didn't want people to think that he was a \"street thug,\" and that he would not be as confrontational with coaches as he had been in the past. Also, at the beginning of preseason practices, he did not start at the bandit safety position that he had started at the previous year. To begin his junior season, he recorded seven tackles in a 48\u201321 victory over Villanova. In the following 24\u20133 loss to East Carolina, he finished second on the team with nine tackles.
