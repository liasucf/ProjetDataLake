It was a preseason game between the defending champions Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday March 29, 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Record crowd watches Dodgers v Red Sox exhibition ==Least attended game in history== Prior to 2020, the least-attended game in MLB history was when zero spectators attended a game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox on April 29, 2015, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards; the game was played behind closed doors due to safety concerns surrounding the 2015 Baltimore protests. The record was previously held by a September 28, 1882, game between the Troy Trojans and the Worcesters in Worcester, Massachusetts, which some reports had only six spectators attend. As both clubs had been notified that they were being dropped from the National League, fans had very little interest in watching the lame-duck teams, especially on a day which the Boston Globe of September 29 (p.2) described as \"bleak, cold and windy.\" ==Highest season home totals, by team== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team name !Season !Home attendance !Per game average !Ballpark |- |Arizona Diamondbacks |1998 |3,610,290 |44,571 |Bank One Ballpark |- |Atlanta Braves |1993 |3,884,720 |47,960 |Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium |- |Baltimore Orioles |1997 |3,711,132 |45,816 |Oriole Park at Camden Yards |- |Boston Red Sox |2009 |3,062,699 |37,811 |Fenway Park |- |Chicago Cubs |2008 |3,300,200 |40,743 |Wrigley Field |- |Chicago White Sox |2006 |2,957,414 |36,511 |U.S. Cellular Field |- |Cincinnati Reds |1976 |2,629,708 |32,466 |Riverfront Stadium |- |Cleveland Indians |1999 |3,468,456 |42,820 |Jacobs Field |- |Colorado Rockies |1993 |4,483,350 |55,350 |Mile High Stadium |- |Detroit Tigers |2008 |3,202,645 |39,539 |Comerica Park |- |Florida Marlins |1993 |3,064,847 |37,838 |Joe Robbie Stadium |- |Houston Astros |2004 |3,087,872 |38,122 |Minute Maid Park |- |Kansas City Royals |2015 |2,708,549 |33,439 |Kauffman Stadium |- ||Los Angeles Angels |2006 |3,406,790 |42,059 |Angel Stadium of Anaheim |- |Los Angeles Dodgers |2019 |3,974,309 |49,066 |Dodger Stadium |- |Milwaukee Brewers |2011 |3,071,373 |37,918 |Miller Park |- |Minnesota Twins |2010 |3,223,640 |39,798 |Target Field |- |New York Mets |2008 |4,042,045 |49,902 |Shea Stadium |- |New York Yankees |2008 |4,298,655 |53,070 |Yankee Stadium |- |Oakland Athletics |1990 |2,900,217 |35,805 |Oakland Coliseum |- |Philadelphia Phillies |2011 |3,680,718 |45,440 |Citizens Bank Park |- |Pittsburgh Pirates |2015 |2,498,596 |30,847 |PNC Park |- |Seattle Mariners |2002 |3,542,938 |43,740 |Safeco Field |- |St. Louis Cardinals |2007 |3,552,180 |43,854 |Busch Stadium |- |San Diego Padres |2004 |3,016,752 |37,244 |Petco Park |- |San Francisco Giants |2011 |3,387,303 |41,819 |AT&T; Park |- |Tampa Bay Rays |1998 |2,506,293 |30,942 |Tropicana Field |- |Texas Rangers |2012 |3,460,280 |42,720 |The Ballpark in Arlington |- |Toronto Blue Jays |1993 |4,057,947 |50,098 |SkyDome |- |Washington Nationals |2005 |2,731,993 |33,728 |R.F.K.
