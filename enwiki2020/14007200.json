He stated that a couple of days prior to publishing the results he was aware of a possible win for Yaroslav the Wise. Prior to that, with a huge lead in first place was the controversial Stepan Bandera. For example, the winner, Yaroslav I, received 60,000 votes in one month and almost 550,000 in just one day. Mykola Amosov, who took second place, received almost 150,000 votes in just one day. Kipiani said that if these manipulation hadn't taken place Yaroslav would not have won. Among other Great Ukrainians for whatever reasons appeared Volodymyr Lenin as well as such names like Stakhanov, Hlushkov, and Vatutin. ==Other editions== Other countries have produced similar shows; see Greatest Britons spin-offs ==References== ==External links== * Official website of the project * Blog of the project in Live Journal * Telekritika: Hanna Homonay will be co-hosting \"Great Ukrainians\" * Kyiv Post: Ukrainians choose their \u2018greats\u2019 * Manipulations in Ukraine * Manipulations in Ukraine II Ukrainians Category:Ukrainian television shows ",
