    "text": "Satellite picture of Europe by night. Lights reveal the urbanized areas of Europe. It also shows the Blue Banana megalopolis from north-west England to northern Italy, and Golden Banana urbanized area between Genoa and Valencia. This list ranks metropolitan areas in Europe by their population according to three different sources; it includes metropolitan areas that have a population of over 1 million. ==Sources== List includes metropolitan areas according only studies of ESPON, Eurostat, and OECD. For this reason some metropolitan areas, like Italian Genoa Metropolitan Area (population is over 1.510.000 as of 2012 according \"CityRailway\" Official Report), aren't included in this list, with data by other statistic survey institutes. Figures in the first column come from the ESPON project, \"Study on Urban Functions\", which defines cities according to the concept of a functional urban area (core urban area defined morphologically on the basis of population density, plus the surrounding labour pool defined on the basis of commuting). Figures in the second column come from Eurostat's Urban Audit and correspond to Larger Urban Zones (LUZ). Figures in the fourth column come from the OECD Territorial Reviews and correspond to \"metropolitan regions\". Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact. ==Metropolitan areas== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Metropolitan area name !Country !City Population Urban Agglomeration (2020) !Eurostat Metropolitan region (2019) click General and regional statistics / Regional statistics by typology / Metropolitan regions / Demography statistics by metropolitan regions / Population on 1 January by broad age group, sex and metropolitan regions (met_pjanaggr3) !Eurostat Metropolitan region (2018) !ESPON Functional Urban Area (2006), Final Report, Chapter 3 !OECD Metropolitan region (2016)Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, , Metropolitan areas, (OECD Publishing, 2017), Table 1.1 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Amsterdam metropolitan area | |2,475,000 |3,269,905 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Antwerp | |1,120,000 |985,332 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Athens | |3,350,000 |3,561,750 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Barcelona metropolitan area | |4,775,000 |5,575,204 | | | |- |Belgrade | |1,420,000 |No data |No data |No data |1,133,146 |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Berlin | |4,725,000 |5,303,846 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Bilbao | |<1,000,000 |1,137,191 | | | |- |Birmingham (West Midlands) | |4,127,349 |3,558,916 | |3,683,000 | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Bremen | |1,000,000 |1,277,609 | | | |- |Bristol | |<1,000,000 |1,157,937 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Brussels-Capital Region | |2,700,000 |2,548,941 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Bucharest metropolitan area | |2,200,000 |2,315,173 | | |No data |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Budapest metropolitan area | |2,625,000 |3,031,160 | | | |- |Cardiff | |<1,000,000 |1,140,165 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Copenhagen | |1,680,000 |2,045,259 | |OECD: Territorial Review Copenhagen, 2009, p. 34, also obtainable through | |- |Donetsk | |1,440,000 |No data |No data |No data |No data |- |Dnipro | |1,390,000 |No data |No data |No data |No data |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Dublin Metropolitan Area | |1,390,000 |2,107,749 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region | |3,250,000 |2,710,127 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Gda\u0144sk (Tricity) | |<1,000,000 | | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Gothenburg | |1,041,850 |1,021,831 | | | |- |Greater Glasgow | |1,680,000 |1,861,315 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |The Hague | ||3,250,000 | | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Hamburg Metropolitan Region | |2,875,000 |3,327,940 | | | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Helsinki Metropolitan Area | |1,300,000 |1,671,024 | | | |- |Istanbul | |16,000,000 |No data |No data |No data | |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Katowice metropolitan area | |2,350,000 |2,695,148 | | | |- |Kazan | |1,260,000 |No data |No data |No data |No data |- |Kharkiv | |1,640,000 |No data |No data |No data |No data |- |Kiev metropolitan area | |3,475,000 |No data |No data |No data |No data |- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" |Krak\u00f3w metropolitan area | |<1,000,000 |1,491,811 | | | |- |West Yorkshire (Leeds -
