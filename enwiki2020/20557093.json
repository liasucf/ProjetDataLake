    "text": "English Americans, or Anglo-Americans, are Americans whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England. In the 2018 American Community Survey, 22.8 million self-identified as being of English origin. The term is distinct from British Americans, which includes not only English Americans but also Scottish, Scotch-Irish (Northern Ireland), Welsh, Cornish and Manx Americans from the whole of the United Kingdom. Demographers regard the reported number of English Americans as a serious undercount, as the index of inconsistency is high and many if not most Americans from English stock have a tendency to identify simply as \"Americans\"Reynolds Farley, 'The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?', Demography, Vol. 28, No. 3 (August 1991), pp. 414, 421.Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, 'The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns', Social Science Research, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44-46.Stanley Lieberson and Mary C. Waters, \"Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites\", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 487, No. 79 (September 1986), pp. 82-86. or if of mixed European ancestry, identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.Mary C. Waters, Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), p. 36. In the 1980 Census, over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry. At 26.34%, this was the largest group amongst the 188 million people who reported at least one ancestry. The population was 226 million which would have made the English ancestry group 22% of the total. Scotch-Irish Americans are for the most part descendants of Lowland Scots and Northern English (specifically - County Durham, Cumberland, Northumberland and Yorkshire) settlers who colonized Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century. In 1982, an opinion poll showed respondents a card listing a number of ethnic groups and asked, \"Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country.\" The English were the top ethnic group, with 66% saying they were a good thing for the United States, followed by the Irish at 62%. Ben J. Wattenberg argues that this poll demonstrates a general American bias against Hispanics and other recent immigrant populations. The majority of the Founding Fathers of the United States were of English extraction. English immigrants in the 19th century, as with other groups, sought economic prosperity. They began migrating in large numbers, without state support, in the 1840s and continued into the 1890s. ==Sense of identity== Jamestown in 1607. Americans of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply \"American\" due to the many historic cultural ties between England and the U.S. and their influence on the country's population. Relative to ethnic groups of other European origins, this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities. Since 1776, English-Americans have been less likely to proclaim their heritage, unlike African Americans, Irish Americans, Scottish Americans, Italian Americans or other ethnic groups. A leading specialist, Charlotte Erickson, found them to be ethnically \"invisible,\" dismissing the occasional St. George Societies as ephemeral elite clubs that were not in touch with the larger ethnic community.Charlotte Erickson, Invisible immigrants: the adaptation of English and Scottish immigrants in nineteenth-century America (1990) In Canada, by contrast, the English organized far more ethnic activism, as the English competed sharply with the well-organized French and Irish elements.Tanja Bueltmann, and Don MacRaild, \"Globalizing St George: English associations in the Anglo-world to the 1930s\" Journal of Global History (2012) 7#1 pp. 79-105 In the United States the Scottish immigrants were much better organized than the English in the 19th century, as are their descendants in the late 20th century.Rowland Berthoff, \"Under the Kilt: Variations on the Scottish-American Ground\" Journal of American Ethnic History (1982) 1#2 pp. 5-34 online ==Number of English Americans== {| class=\"wikitable\" font-size:90%;\" style=\"float:right; ! colspan=\"5\"|Results per U.S. census |- !

There is debate over the accuracy between the studies with individual scholars and the Federal Government using different techniques and conclusion for the ethnic composition. A study published in 1909 titled A Century of Population Growth. From the First to the Twelfth census of the United States: 1790-1900 by the Government Census Bureau estimated the English were 83.5%, 6.7% Scottish, 1.6% Irish, 2.0% Dutch, 0.5% French, 5.6% German and 0.1% all others of the white population. Hebrews were less than one-tenth of 1 per cent. When the Scotch and Irish are added, British origins would be more than 90% of the European stock. The same 1909 data for each state (of the total European population only) of English stock were Connecticut 96.2%, Rhode Island 96.0%, Vermont 95.4%, Massachusetts 95.0%, New Hampshire 94.1%, Maine 93.1%, Virginia 85.0%, Maryland 84.0%, North Carolina 83.1%, South Carolina 82.4%, New York 78.2% and Pennsylvania 59.0%. Another source by Thomas L. Purvis in 1984 estimated that people of English ancestry made up about 47.5% of the total population or 60.9% of the European American or white population (his figures can also be found, and as divided by region, in Colin Bonwick, The American Revolution, 1991 p. 2540-839-1346-2). The study which gives similar results can be found in The American Revolution, Colin Bonwick in percentages for 1790: 47.9 English, 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish (Ulster), 4.3 Scottish, 4.7 Irish (South), 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French, 0.2 Swedish, 19.3 Black. The difference between the two estimates are found by comparing the ratios of the groups (adding and subtracting) to accommodate and adding the Welsh.1991, The category 'Irish' in the Bonwick study represents immigrants from Ireland outside the Province of Ulster, the overwhelming majority of whom were Protestant and not ethnically Irish, though from Ireland. They were not Irish Catholics. By the time the American War for Independence started in 1776, Catholics were 1.6%, or 40,000 persons of the 2.5 million population of the 13 colonies.Richard Middleton, Colonial America (2003), 95\u2013100, 145, 158, 159, 349nMaynard, 126-126 Some 80.7% of the total United States population was of European origin. In 1900, an estimated 28,375,000 or 37.8% of the population of the United States was wholly or primarily of English ancestry from colonial stock. ===Census: 1980-2000=== In 1980, 23,748,772 Americans claimed only English ancestry and another 25,849,263 claimed English along with another ethnic ancestry. 13.3 million or 5.9% of the total U.S. population chose to identify as \"American\" (counted under \"not specified\") as also seen in censuses that followed.Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 (Supplementary Report PC80-S1-10) Issued: April 1983 Below shows the persons who reported at least one specific ancestry are as follows.Single ancestry response by Region, Division and State - 1980 censusMultiple ancestry response by Region, Division and State - 1980 census {|class=\"sort wikitable unsortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:left;\"|Response||Number||Percent||Northeast||North Central||South||West |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Single ancestry||23,748,772||47.9||2,984,931||4,438,223||12,382,681||3,942,937 |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Multiple ancestry||25,849,263||52.1||5,190,045||7,099,961||7,235,689||6,323,568 |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Totals||colspan=2 style=\"text- align:center;\"|49,598,035||8,174,976||11,538,184||19,618,370||10,266,505 |- |} In 1990, the national level response rate for the question was high with 90.4% of the total United States population choosing at least one specific ancestry and 9.6% ignored the question completely. Of those who chose English, 66.9% of people chose it as their first response. Totals for the English showed a considerable decrease from the previous census.

With the permission of James I, three ships (the Susan Constant, The Discovery, and The God Speed) sailed from England and landed at Cape Henry in April, under the captainship of Christopher Newport, who had been hired by the London Company to lead expeditions to what is now America. The first self-governing document of Plymouth Colony. English Pilgrims signing the Mayflower Compact in 1620. The second successful colony was Plymouth Colony, founded in 1620 by people who later became known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing religious persecution in the East Midlands in England, they first went to Holland, but feared losing their English identity. Because of this, they chose to relocate to the New World, with their voyage being financed by English investors. In September 1620, 102 passengers set sail aboard the Mayflower, eventually settling at Plymouth Colony in November. Of the passengers on the Mayflower, 41 men signed the \"Mayflower Compact\" aboard ship on November 11, 1620, while anchored in Provincetown Harbor. Signers included Carver, Alden, Standish, Howland, Bradford, Allerton, and Fuller.William Bradford, Edward Winslow (printer G. Mourt [George Morton], Relation or Iournall of the beginning and proceedings of the English Plantation setled at Plimoth in New England, Early English Books Online, p.4 This story has become a central theme in the United States cultural identity. A number of English colonies were established under a system of proprietary governors, who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements. England also took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland (including the New Amsterdam settlement), renaming it the Province of New York in 1664. With New Netherland, the English came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered from Sweden earlier. This became part of Pennsylvania. ===English immigration after 1776=== Cultural similarities and a common language allowed English immigrants to integrate rapidly and gave rise to a unique Anglo-American culture. An estimated 3.5 million English immigrated to the U.S. after 1776. English settlers provided a steady and substantial influx throughout the 19th century. {| class=\"sort wikitable unsortable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:95%;\" |- !colspan=4|English immigration to the United States |- !

Most of these were small farmers and tenant farmers from depressed areas in rural counties in southern and western England and urban laborers who fled from the depressions and from the social and industrial changes of the late 1820s-1840s. While some English immigrants were drawn by dreams of creating model utopian societies in America, most others were attracted by the lure of new lands, textile factories, railroads, and the expansion of mining. A number of English settlers moved to the United States from Australia in the 1850s (then a British political territory), when the California Gold Rush boomed; these included the so-called \"Sydney Ducks\" (see Australian Americans). During the last years of the 1860s, annual English immigration grew to over 60,000 and continued to rise to over 75,000 per year in 1872, before experiencing a decline. The final and most sustained wave of immigration began in 1879 and lasted until the depression of 1893. During this period English annual immigration averaged more than 82,000, with peaks in 1882 and 1888 and did not drop significantly until the financial panic of 1893. The building of America's transcontinental railroads, the settlement of the great plains, and industrialization attracted skilled and professional emigrants from England. {| class=\"sort wikitable unsortable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:90%;\" |- !colspan=4| English-born in the United States |- !

While most settled in America, a number of skilled craftsmen remained itinerant, returning to England after a season or two of work. Groups of English immigrants came to America as missionaries for the Salvation Army and to work with the activities of the Evangelical and LDS Churches. The depression of 1893 sharply decreased English emigration to the United States, and it stayed low for much of the twentieth century. This decline reversed itself in the decade of World War II when over 100,000 English (18 percent of all European immigrants) came from England. In this group was a large contingent of war brides who came between 1945 and 1948. In these years four women emigrated from England for every man. In the 1950s, English immigration increased to over 150,000.and rose to 170,000 in the 1960s. While differences developed, it is not surprising that English immigrants had little difficulty in assimilating to American life. The American resentment against the policies of the British government was rarely transferred to English settlers who came to America in the first decades of the nineteenth century. ===Political influence=== As the earliest colonists of the United States, settlers from England and their descendants often held positions of power and made and enforced laws, often because many had been involved in government back in England. In the original 13 colonies, most laws contained elements found in the English common law system. John Trumbull's famous painting, Declaration of Independence. The majority of the Founding Fathers of the United States were of English extraction. A minority were of high social status and can be classified as White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP). Many of the prewar WASP elite were Loyalists who left the new nation.Richard D. Brown, \"The Founding Fathers of 1776 and 1787: A collective view.\" William and Mary Quarterly (1976) 33#3: 465-480, especially pp 466, 478-79. online While WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants usually of English origins) have been major players in every major American political party, an exceptionally strong association has existed between WASPs and the Republican Party, before the 1980s. A few top Democrats qualified, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt. Northeastern Republican leaders such as Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts, Prescott Bush of Connecticut and especially Nelson Rockefeller of New York exemplified the pro-business liberal Republicanism of their social stratum, espousing internationalist views on foreign policy, supporting social programs, and holding liberal views on issues like racial integration. A famous confrontation was the 1952 Senate election in Massachusetts where John F. Kennedy, a Catholic of Irish descent, defeated WASP Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.. However the challenge by Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the Eastern Republican establishment helped undermine the WASP dominance. Goldwater himself had solid WASP credentials through his mother, of a prominent old Yankee family, but was instead mistakenly seen as part of the Jewish community (which he had never associated with). By the 1980s, the liberal Rockefeller Republican wing of the party was marginalized, overwhelmed by the dominance of the Southern and Western conservative Republicans.Nicol C. Rae, The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present (1989) Asking \"Is the WASP leader a dying breed?\" journalist Nina Strochlic in 2012 pointed to eleven WASP top politicians\u2014typically scions of upper class English families. She ended with Republicans G.H.W. Bush elected in 1988, his son George W. Bush elected in 2000 and 2004, and John McCain, who was nominated but defeated in 2008.Nina Strochlic, \"George Washington to George W. Bush: 11 WASPs Who Have Led America,\" Daily Beast Aug. 16, 2012 ==Language== English language distribution in the United States. English is the most commonly spoken language in the U.S, where it is estimated that two thirds of all native speakers of English live. The American English dialect developed from English colonization. It serves as the de facto official language, the language in which government business is carried out. According to the 1990 census, 94% of the U.S. population speak only English. Adding those who speak English \"well\" or \"very well\" brings this figure to 96%. Only 0.8% speak no English at all as compared with 3.6% in 1890. American English differs from British English in a number of ways, the most striking being in terms of pronunciation (for example, American English retains the pronunciation of the letter \"R\" after vowels, unlike standard British English, though it still can be heard in several regional dialects in England) and spelling (one example is the \"u\" in words such as color, favor (US) vs colour, favour (UK)). Less obvious differences are present in grammar and vocabulary. The differences are rarely a barrier to effective communication between American English and British English speakers, but there are certainly enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings, usually surrounding slang or dialect differences. Some states, like California, have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language, but in practice, this only means that official government documents must at least be in English, and does not mean that they should be exclusively available only in English. For example, the standard California Class C driver's license examination is available in 32 different languages. ===Expression=== \"In for a penny, in for a pound\" is an expression to mean, (\"if you're going to take a risk at all, you might as well make it a big risk\"), is used in the United States which dates back to the colonial period, when cash in the colonies was denominated in Pounds, shillings and Pence. Today, the one-cent coin is commonly known as a penny. A modern alternative expression is \"In for a dime, in for a dollar\". ==Cultural contributions== American cultural icons, apple pie, baseball, and the American flag. Much of American culture shows influences from English culture. ===Cuisine=== *Apple pie - New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially \"American\", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey.Fischer, pp. 74, 114, 134\u201339. \"As American as apple pie\" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all- American. *Roast Beef - In the middle of the 17th century a second wave of English immigrants began arriving in North America, settling mainly in the Chesapeake Bay region of Virginia and Maryland, expanding upon the Jamestown settlement. Their roast beef was often served with Yorkshire puddings and horseradish sauce. (It was despised by the French.) ===Celebrations=== Plymouth Colony by English Pilgrims in October 1621. *Thanksgiving was celebrated by English settlers to give thanks to God for helping the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony survive the brutal winter. This feast lasted three days, and\u2014as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow.William Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620\u20131647, 85. ===Law=== The American legal system also has its roots in English law. For example, elements of the Magna Carta were incorporated into the United States constitution. English law prior to the revolution is still part of the law of the United States, and provides the basis for many American legal traditions and policies. After the revolution, English law was again adopted by the now independent American States. ===Music=== *National anthem - The Star-Spangled Banner takes its melody from the 18th-century English song \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. The lyrics were written by Francis Scott Key of English descent. This became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, which was officially designated as the U.S. national anthem in 1931. *Hail to the Chief - is the song to announce the arrival or presence of the President of the United States. English songwriter James Sanderson (c. 1769 \u2013 c. 1841), composed the music and was first performed in 1812 in New York. Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom. *The Liberty Song - written by John Dickinson of English descent in 1768 to the music of Englishman William Boyce's \"Heart of Oak\", is perhaps the first patriotic song written in America. The song contains the line \"by uniting we stand, by dividing we fall\", the first recorded use of the sentiment. *America (My Country, 'Tis of Thee) - whose melody was indirectly derived from the British national anthem, also served as a de facto anthem before the adoption of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" *Amazing Grace - written by English poet and clergyman John Newton became such an icon in American culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns, placing it in danger of becoming a clich\u00e9. *Yankee Doodle - is written and accredited to Englishman Dr. Richard Shuckburgh an army doctor. The tune comes from the English nursery rhyme Lucy Locket. English ballads, jigs, and hornpipes had a large influence on American folk music, eventually contributing to the formation of such genres as old time, country, and bluegrass. ===Sports=== Henry Chadwick\u2019s early contributions to the development of the game is often called the \"Father of Baseball\". *Baseball was invented in England. English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008. This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by British immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in \"A Little Pretty Pocket- Book\" in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball. *American football traces its roots to early versions of rugby football, played in England and first developed in American universities in the mid-19th century. ==English family names== In 2010, the top ten family names in the United States, seven have English origins or having possible mixed British Isles heritage, the other three being of Spanish origin. Many African Americans have their origins in slavery (i.e. slave name) and ancestrally came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master. {|class=\"sort wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" |- !
