    "text": "First Avenue School is a historic school building at Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It is a large classically inspired building prominently situated on a mostly residential street, one block west of Glen Burnie's central business district. It was built and probably designed by Edward Woodfall, a noted local architect and builder. The school has two sections; one built in 1899 and a second in 1917. The first section is a brick, one- story, two-room, hip-roofed building now serves as a rear wing to the 1917 addition. The large two-story brick gable-roofed Classical Revival-style addition more than quadrupled the school's size. After closure as a school, the building was used as a beauty school and church, and is being converted to condominiums. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==References== ==External links== *, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Buildings and structures in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ",
