    "text": "Share My World is the third studio album by American R&B; singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige, released by MCA Records on Earth Day, April 22, 1997. The album became Blige\u2019s first to open at number one on the US Billboard 200 album chart. Moreover, it is her first album where she serves as an executive producer, alongside Steve Stoute, who also shared executive producer credits on the album. Guest appearances are made by hip hop and R&B; stars such as Lil' Kim, Nas, The LOX, George Benson, Roy Ayers and R. Kelly, the album was released to generally positive reviews from most music critics, and earned Blige numerous accolades and nominations, including a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B; Album in 1998. The album became her first to chart in the top ten internationally, including Canada, Sweden and the UK, while it entered the top forty in countries such as New Zealand, Germany and France. It is certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for excess of three million copies sold in the US. == Background == Share My World marked several personal and professional changes in Blige\u2019s life and career. Following the departure of label head Andre Harrell the year before, Blige defected from Uptown Records in favor of its MCA parent. Meanwhile, she severed professional ties with long-time producer, manager and mentor Sean \"Puffy\" Combs shortly before the production of Share My World began. His absence was filled with a bevy of high-profile producers, such as: Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Babyface, Bryce Wilson and R. Kelly. The end result produced an album that was less entrenched in the hip hop soul of her first two albums, and replaced with a style that was more aligned with R&B.; During the making and run of her second album My Life (1994), Blige had reportedly experienced clinical depression, while also battling drug and alcohol addiction, and enduring an often turbulent relationship with K-Ci Hailey \u2014 all of which heavily influenced the dark mood of that album. In late 1996, however, Blige reportedly made a concerted effort to clean up her life and subsequently found herself in more positive frame of mind while recording Share My World, which influenced the albums noticeably lighter mood. == Release and reception == ===Commercial performance=== For the Billboard issue dated May 10, 1997, Share My World debuted at number one on both the US Billboard 200 and R&B; Albums chart with sales of 240,000 copies, marking Blige's first official number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart. The album had ended the four-week stint of Life After Death by The Notorious B.I.G., which was released posthumously five weeks earlier. In addition to debuting number one in the US, the album also debuted in the top ten in countries such as Canada, Sweden and the UK. The album also reached the top forty in France, Germany and New Zealand. Share My World was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of one million copies in the US on July 1, 1997. On November 17, 1997, Share My World was later certified double platinum by the RIAA and during an episode of MTV Live, Blige was presented with the plaque by host Ananda Lewis. The album has since sold three million copies domestically by May 1999, garnering Blige's third consecutive album to reach multi-platinum status by the RIAA. ===Critical reception=== Alex Henderson of AllMusic wrote in his review, \"Her strongest and most confident effort up to that point, Share had much more character, personality, and honesty than most of the assembly line fare dominating urban radio in 1997. For all their slickness, emotive cuts like \"Get to Know You Better,\" \"Love Is All We Need,\" and \"Keep Your Head\" left no doubt that Blige was indeed a singer of depth and substance. Although high tech, the production of everyone from R. Kelly (with whom she duets on the inviting \"It's On\") and Babyface to Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis doesn't come across as forced or robotic, but, in fact, is impressively organic.\" Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone commended Blige's transition from sound to singing, writing that \"On Share My World even Blige's harshest critics will have to concede that she's moved beyond sound to real singing. Listen to \"Seven Days,\" \"Missing You\" and the already-classic \"Not Gon' Cry\" (also on the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack), and you hear Blige's signature ache married to newfound technique. There's shading, depth and control in her vocals now.\" Steve Jones of USA Today said the songs \"run the usual gamut of love themes, but it's Blige's powerful, emotional deliveries and street sensibility that separate her from the competition.\"USA Today review Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said \"Blige is a diva for her own time. As befits her hip hop ethos, she's never soft if often vulnerable, and as befits her hip hop aesthetic, she plays her natural vocal cadences for melodic signature and sometimes hook. She redefines the New York accent for the '90s. And she's taken two straight follow-ups to the next level.\" Jonathan Bernstein from Entertainment Weekly was more critical, finding Share My World \"uneven\" and the songwriting \"meandering and half finished.\" Tom Moon later wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that the record displayed \"Blige's hit- song savvy but fewer memorable performances\" than previous albums. ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
