    "text": "Tibur\u00f3n (Spanish: Shark) is a salsa song by Rub\u00e9n Blades and Willie Col\u00f3n which appeared on their 1981 album Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos. The song is a metaphor for American intervention in Latin America, with the titular shark representing the influence of American imperialism in the region. Throughout the second half of the song, the singers shout the phrase, \"si lo ven que viene, \u00a1palo al tibur\u00f3n!\" (\"If you see him coming, [bring a] stick to the shark!\") == Reception == Music critic Dave Marsh listed \"Tibur\u00f3n\" as one of his top 20 political songs written after 1976, calling it \"the original anti-Central America invasion protest.\" At the time of its release, American radios played the song infrequently, and it was heavily unpopular among the Cuban community in Miami. In a 1991 interview, Col\u00f3n said that politically charged songs like \"Tibur\u00f3n\" and \"Pedro Navaja\" were so controversial that he and Blades occasionally performed them in bulletproof vests. == References == == External links == * Lyrics to this song at SongLyrics Category:Spanish-language songs Category:Rub\u00e9n Blades songs Category:1981 songs Category:Songs written by Rub\u00e9n Blades Category:Willie Col\u00f3n songs Category:Protest songs Category:Songs about the United States ",
