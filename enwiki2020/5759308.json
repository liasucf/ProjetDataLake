It is located by the Padma River. The school was founded in 1981. It has a legacy of quality and contemporary education based on Islamic knowledge. The founding principal is Md. Sirajul Islam. The school is one of the famous destinations for quality education in Rajshahi city. Rajshahi is also known as the education city of Bangladesh. The school is situated at the center of the city.

In 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs of Bangladesh issued a letter to the Ministry of Education based on the intelligence report. It was said that the mosque mission academy school and college were used in the secret political activities of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, which lost its registration for accused in war crime during 1971. Books prescribed by Jamaat-e-Islami outside the books prescribed by the state are taught in this institution. After the controversy arose, the Bangladesh Audit Department completed an audit of the institution and found serious financial inconsistencies. According to their report, the institution collects compulsory money from students in the name of the foundation. No account is kept of the expenditure of this money, which is against the law. Besides, the report also provided information about embezzlement of around Tk 11 crore in 10 years. A member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Education told a news conference that the embezzled money had been spent on anti-state activities. At the same time, he complained that no recruitment was done in this institution outside of Islam. There is not even student admission, which is in conflict with the constitution of the country. He revoked the registration of the Masjid Mission Foundation and demanded that the three branches of the Masjid Mission Academy School and College be run in the same way as other educational institutions under the MPO of the state. Against this information, however, a statement under the banner of Alumni of Masjid Mission Academy School and College was published in the Daily Sangram, known as the mouthpiece of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. Earlier, in 2005, there was a controversy over the teaching methods and curriculum of this institution after finding Mamun, a member of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a banned organization accused of militancy, and was one of the accused in a series of bombings across the country on August 17 of that year, was a student of this institution. ==References== Category:Schools in Rajshahi District Category:Rajshahi Category:1981 establishments in Bangladesh ",
