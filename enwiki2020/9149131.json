    "text": "Maidan Nezalezhnosti () is a station on Kyiv Metro's Obolonsko\u2013Teremkivska line. The station was opened on December 17, 1976, and is named after Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) on the Khreschatyk street. It was designed by N. Kolomiiets, I. Maslenkov, M. Syrkyn, and F. Zaremba. The station was formerly known as Ploscha Kalinina, but was renamed a year after its opening to Ploscha Zhovtnevoi revoliutsii (). Maidan Nezalezhnosti forms a station complex with a transfer section with the neighbouring Khreschatyk station on the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. The station is laid deep underground and consists of a central hall with porticoes. The lamps which light the station are hidden in the niches between the columns and the walls. ==External links== * Kyivsky Metropoliten \u2014 Station description and photographs * Metropoliten.kiev.ua \u2014 Station description and photographs Category:Kiev Metro stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1976 Category:Pecherskyi District ",
