    "text": "f\u00f8tex is a Danish chain of supermarkets. The business was established in 1960 as the first supermarket in Denmark and later gave rise to Salling Group (previously Dansk Supermarked Group). The name \"f\u00f8tex\" is a mix of the Danish words \"F\u00f8devarer\" (daily groceries) and \"Textil\" (textiles). == History == The first f\u00f8tex store in Guldsmedgade, Aarhus from 1960. The store was renovated in 2010 and the f\u00f8tex food concept was introduced. Herman Salling opened the first f\u00f8tex in 1960 in the street \"Guldsmedgade\" in the city of \u00c5rhus in Denmark. F\u00f8tex in many ways revolutionized the way in which the Danes shopped: this was the first time the Danes saw a non-food (electronics, clothes, perfumes, books etc.) and a food department gathered under one roof. In 1964, Herman Salling, ancestor of Ferdinand Salling, realized that to compete with other initiatives starting in those years, he needed a strong financial support. He contacted the A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk Group which acquired 50% of the shares and supported Sallings project financially. As of 2006, the chain consists of 76 stores located all over Denmark, with f\u00f8tex in Ringsted as the newest store, opened October 18, 2006. Further expansion is planned. == A typical store == Inside a typical f\u00f8tex, there is a food section, a deli and a non-food section. The food section is like a full-service supermarket, with a bakery and a butcher. The non-food section includes electronics, cosmetics and clothing among other general things. F\u00f8tex also launched an e-commerce area with the ability to print digital photos. The online store also includes music downloads. == f\u00f8tex food == The f\u00f8tex food concept was introduced in 2010, also in the original store in Guldsmedgade in Aarhus at the store's 50-year anniversary. The f\u00f8tex food concept phased out the non-food departments and concentrated focus on food items instead. ==See also== * Bilka * Netto * T\u00f8j & Sko * A-Z * A.P.
