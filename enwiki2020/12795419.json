    "text": "In mathematics, Laplace's principle is a basic theorem in large deviations theory which is similar to Varadhan's lemma. It gives an asymptotic expression for the Lebesgue integral of exp(\u2212\u03b8\u03c6(x)) over a fixed set A as \u03b8 becomes large. Such expressions can be used, for example, in statistical mechanics to determining the limiting behaviour of a system as the temperature tends to absolute zero. ==Statement of the result== Let A be a Lebesgue-measurable subset of d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd and let \u03c6 : Rd \u2192 R be a measurable function with :\\int_A e^{-\\varphi(x)} \\,dx < \\infty. Then :\\lim_{\\theta \\to \\infty} \\frac1{\\theta} \\log \\int_A e^{-\\theta \\varphi(x)} \\, dx = - \\mathop{\\mathrm{ess \\, inf}}_{x \\in A} \\varphi(x), where ess inf denotes the essential infimum. Heuristically, this may be read as saying that for large \u03b8, :\\int_A e^{-\\theta \\varphi(x)} \\, dx \\approx \\exp \\left(-\\theta \\mathop{\\mathrm{ess \\, inf}}_{x \\in A} \\varphi(x) \\right). ==Application== The Laplace principle can be applied to the family of probability measures P\u03b8 given by :\\mathbf{P}_\\theta (A) = \\left( \\int_A e^{-\\theta \\varphi(x)} \\, dx \\right) \\bigg/ \\left( \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{d}} e^{-\\theta \\varphi(y)} \\, dy \\right) to give an asymptotic expression for the probability of some event A as \u03b8 becomes large. For example, if X is a standard normally distributed random variable on R, then :\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} \\varepsilon \\log \\mathbf{P} \\big[ \\sqrt{\\varepsilon} X \\in A \\big] = - \\mathop{\\mathrm{ess \\, inf}}_{x \\in A} \\frac{x^2}{2} for every measurable set A. == See also == * Laplace's method ==References== * Category:Asymptotic analysis Category:Large deviations theory Category:Probability theorems Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Mathematical principles Category:Theorems in analysis ",
