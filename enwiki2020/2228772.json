He served as Vice President of Honduras in the cabinet of General Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez. When L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez died while in office, then Bueso succeeded him. However, Bueso, in turn, was driven from the capital by rebels led by General Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino, who took charge of the country as First Chief of the Liberating Revolution. By 31 March, the United States had sent 176 officers and men from the cruiser to land at Amapala to quell the disturbance. ==External links== * Time Magazine, 31 March 1924 Category:1860 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Presidents of Honduras Category:Vice Presidents of Honduras Category:Liberal Party of Honduras politicians ",
