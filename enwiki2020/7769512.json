It took place between 24 January and 17 February 1943, as 4th phase of the general Soviet Winter-offensive of 1942-1943, immediately following the Ostrogozhsk-Rossoshansk operation. The Axis had captured Voronezh in a 1942 battle, and the 2nd German Army occupied this important bridgehead over the Don, together with Hungarian troops that had escaped the destruction of the Hungarian 2nd Army during the Ostrogozhsk- Rossoshansk operation. The Red Army executed a new pincer movement in difficult winter conditions. From the south, the troops of the Voronezh Front under command of General Golikov attacked, in collaboration with the left flank of the Bryansk Front under General Max Reyter, which attacked from the north.John Erickson, The road to Berlin, Cassel, 1983 ; AA.VV., L'URSS nella seconda guerra mondiale, volume III, CEI, 1978. The Germans, attacked on both flanks, were forced into a retreat in the middle of the Russian winter. Their losses were considerable and the 2nd German Army only narrowly escaped destruction, leaving a big gap in the Axis frontline. It opened for the Soviets the way to Kursk, which would be liberated during Operation Star, and also threatened the important bastion of Orel. == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * Category:1943 in the Soviet Union Category:Battles involving the Soviet Union Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Battles of World War II involving Hungary Category:Battles and operations of the Soviet\u2013German War Category:January 1943 events Category:February 1943 events ",
