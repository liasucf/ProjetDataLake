The dissertation is widely appreciated internationally. Later she compared the syntax of the Russian and Finnish languages and studied the features of spoken Russian. She also initiated the study of the oral history of the Russian population in Finland, especially of those evacuated from the Karelian Isthmus, on which subject she supervised a number of academic theses. Leinonen\u2019s own studies in this field deal with language contacts and the traditions and everyday history of Russians in Finland. She was also interested in the Russian loanwords in Stadin slangi or the Helsinki slang. In her later life, Leinonen learnt the Komi language, and together with Komi colleagues, published studies on the structure of that language and language contacts in that area. She also studied the history of scholarship on the Finno-Ugric peoples and languages in northern Russia. Leinonen was at home in various archives. She also translated into Finnish various linguistic and ethnographic works on northern regions as well as travel accounts. She also participated in Michael Branch\u2019s project on publishing A. J. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s travel journals on the website of the Finnish National Library. During her retirement, Leinonen took up Baltic languages and studied language contacts in that area. She learnt the Latvian language and translated Latvian literature into Finnish. She also sang in the Helsinki Latvian Choir. Leinonen\u2019s hobbies included painting and bird watching and travelling. == References == == External links == *Obituary of Marja Leinonen Helsingin Sanomat Category:1946 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Linguists from Finland Category:Academics of the University of Helsinki Category:University of Helsinki alumni Category:Translators from Latvian Category:Translators to Finnish Category:Women linguists Category:Komi language ",
