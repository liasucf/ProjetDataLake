It is a full-time, one-year program (75 ECTS) which includes formal teaching (in French or English), an internship, and the preparation of an individual thesis. It is usually aimed at young professionals who already have a master's degree, but would like either to specialise or expand their knowledge and experience in a domain where the private sector has identified a real need. In 2008-2009, 418 Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s were offered by the 90 Grandes \u00e9coles Les mast\u00e8res de la CGE which are part of the \"Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles\". They cover a wide variety of specialised subjects: aeronautics, business, informatics etc. Les mast\u00e8res par grand domaine Since 1986, 82,000 students have graduated with a Mast\u00e8re Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9. The Mast\u00e8re Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 should not be confused with the Executive Mast\u00e8re Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 which is another post-graduate program offered by the Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles. The Executive Specialized Masters is similar to the Specialized Masters in that the normal entry requirement is a Master's level degree. However, unlike the Specialized Masters it is a part-time program, designed for professionals who would like to consolidate and expand their expertise in a specific domain, while continuing to work full-time. In addition to their degree, participants usually have at least three years professional experience, and are often sponsored by their employers. The program takes fifteen months, at the end of which the student is expected to submit an individual thesis. == History == The history of the Mast\u00e8re Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 starts in 1986. During the end of the 1980s, the Commission des Titres d'Ing\u00e9nieur required that a student spend three years in a grande \u00e9cole to graduate with the French Dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur. But a lot of foreign students sometimes came to study in France's grandes \u00e9coles for only a year, and came back to their own country without a degree. Also, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System was not yet adopted by all the schools. In the meantime, many companies in France were looking for graduated students with specialized skills, for jobs in key sectors. As a consequence, the French Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles created the Mast\u00e8re Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9. 25 ans des Mast\u00e8res Sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s !
