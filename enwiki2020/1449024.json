    "text": "Newark Days is an annual celebration that takes place in Newark, California every September to celebrate the incorporation of the city of Newark on September 22, 1955. In its current form it is a four-day event, Thursday through Sunday, in mid to late September. It is centered on Newark Community Park & Community Center as well as the adjacent MacGregor School Grounds. In addition to carnival rides, food and game booths, and stage shows, it includes a race and a parade along \"the Newark Mile\" (a stretch of Newark Blvd.) on the Saturday morning. Annual attendance for the celebration is more than 100,000.Newark Days website == History == What is now called Newark Days was originally planned by members of the Newark Chamber of Commerce. They later turned the festivities over to the Jaycees. In the 1960s a group called \"Newark Birthday Celebration\" was formed. However, the event was not put on during the late 1960s. In 1972, Shirley Sisk called a meeting to see if there were enough volunteers to plan an event for that September. Interest was high, and \"Newark Days Celebration\" was formed. The Newark Rotary club brought in a carnival, and the committee put together food booths and games at the Pavilion. The weekend was a huge success, and a nonprofit corporation was formed to make it a regular annual event. A volunteer 30-member committee works year-round to organize it, and more than 200 volunteers assist at the event. In 2005, Newark Days celebrated Newark's 50th anniversary with a 1950s theme and the return of Arknew, a kangaroo that was Newark's old town mascot. == Themes == Every year, the Newark Days Celebration features a different theme. *1988 Every Day's a Holiday\"NEWARK DAYS GOES WITH HOLIDAY THEME FOR WEEKEND CELEBRATION\", 12 September 1990, San Jose Mercury News *1989 People, Pride & Progress *1990 The Magic of Newark *1991 Newark Then & Now *1992 Where Fairy Tales Come True *1993 Railroad Days *1994 The Best of the West *1995 Remembering When\"NEWARK'S SILLIMAN TO RIDE AGAIN AS GRAND MARSHAL\", 14 September 1995, San Jose Mercury News *1996 There's No Place Like Home *1997 It's a Small World *1998 Under the Big TopA PARADE WITHOUT PRETENSION, 20 September 1998, San Jose Mercury News *1999 *2000 The Sounds of Music *2001 Newarks of the WorldNewark Days, 21 September 2001, The Argus *2002 Celebrate AmericaKuznia, Rob. \"Ex-Raider grand marshal of Newark parade\", 5 September 2002, The Oakland Tribune *2003 Every Day's a HolidayKuznia, Rob.
