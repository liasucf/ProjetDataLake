    "text": "Ulmus 'Rebona' is an American hybrid cultivar raised by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) as selection 'W916', derived from a crossing of Japanese Elm clone W43-8 = 'Reseda' with Siberian Elm clone W426 grown from seed collected from a street tree at Yankton, South Dakota. The tree was registered in 1993 by Conrad Appel KG, of Darmstadt (ceased trading 2006) and is a sibling of 'New Horizon' (selection 'W917'). In Europe, 'Rebona' is marketed as a Resista elm protected under E U breeders' rights (E U council decision 2100/94). ==Description== 'Rebona' leaf 'Rebona' bears a close resemblance to its sibling 'New Horizon', but requires less maintenance owing to a better leader. The tree grows rapidly, developing a fastigiate pyramidal shape with ascending branches. The glossy clear-green leaves are comparatively small, though slightly larger than those of 'New Horizon'.Heybroek, H. M., Goudzwaard, L, Kaljee, H. (2009).
