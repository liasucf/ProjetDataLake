    "text": "The Voicenotes Tour was the third concert tour by American singer Charlie Puth, in support of his second studio album Voicenotes (2018). The tour began in Toronto, Canada at the Budweiser Stage on July 11, 2018, and concluded in Tokyo, Japan at Tokyo International Forum on November 22, 2018. == Background == On December 18, 2017, Puth announced his first major headlining tour after opening for Shawn Mendes on his Illuminate World Tour. Hailee Steinfeld was announced as the opening act. The tour dates were announced and set to take place in 32 different cities in North America. On June 27, 2018, several dates were announced for Asia where the tour would be produced by Live Nation Asia. == Critical Reception == The tour received positive reviews. Taylor Weatherby from Billboard praised the stage setup, writing that \u201cthe angled backdrop includes two massive screens that flash between Charlie, mesmerizing light shows and crowd shots, making the otherwise pretty simple staging feel vast\u201d, in addition to noting the \u201cquirky commentary\u201d between performances, Puth's \u201cdad moves\u201d during performances, and his \u201cinspiring level of confidence\u201d while shirtless. Bobby Olivier from NJ.com, described Puth as having \u201ca severe case of pop star personality disorder\u201d, praised Puth's use of a keytar as him having \u201cplayed the hell out of an instrument in which no pop artist has seriously dabbled for the last five presidential administrations,\u201d in addition to writing that \u201cthe deafening response to every close-up camera shot of the star\u2019s face or body wasn\u2019t far from how diehards manically cheer for his slightly more famous constituents Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles\u201d. David Peng, from Young Post of South China Morning Post, praised Puth's vocals, describing them as \u201csweet and soft\u201d with \u201chis sound so clear it rivaled the studio-recorded version\u201d. == Set list == This set list is from the show in Toronto on July 11, 2018, and is not intended to represent all concerts for the tour. # \"The Way I Am\" # \"Slow It Down\" # \"How Long\" # \"Empty Cups\" # \"LA Girls\" # \"Marvin Gaye\" # \"Patient\" # \"Change\" # \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" # \"Somebody Told Me\" # \"Done for Me\" # \"Suffer\" # \"One Call Away\" # \"Attention\" Encore # * \"BOY\" #\"See You Again\" == Tour dates == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, opening acts, tickets sold, amount of available tickets, and gross revenue |- !
