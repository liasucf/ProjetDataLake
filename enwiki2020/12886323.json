Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (\u9806\u5929, Heaven's Will) was the mythical sword of the Vietnamese King L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, who liberated Vietnam from Ming occupation after ten years of fighting from 1418 until 1428.Th\u1ebf D\u0169ng H\u00e0n L\u00ea L\u1ee3i: ti\u1ec3u thuy\u1ebft l\u1ecbch s\u1eed 2002 Page 17 \"\u0110\u1ec7 nh\u00ecn k\u1ef9 th\u00ec nh\u1eadn ra \u0111\u00f3 l\u00e0 l\u01b0\u1ee1i ki\u1ebfm, hai ch\u1eef Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean n\u1ed5i l\u00ean m\u00e0u v\u00e0ng r\u1ef1c r\u1ee1.\" L\u00ea L\u1ee3i then proclaimed himself king of the newly established L\u00ea Dynasty. According to legend, the sword possessed magical power, which supposedly made L\u00ea L\u1ee3i grow very tall. When he used the sword it gave him the strength of a thousand men, and the legend is often used to justify L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's rule over Vietnam. The sword has been associated with L\u00ea L\u1ee3i since the early phase of the L\u00ea Dynasty. ==Name== The Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean sword was used to affirm the legitimacy of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i as the Vietnamese leader in the revolution against the Ming occupation and associated with L\u00ea L\u1ee3i the rightful sovereignty of Vietnam. In Vietnam, the legitimacy of the monarch is known as the mandate of heaven. ==Legend== A 14th century single edged curved blade called \"g\u01b0\u01a1m\"- Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean may belong to this class of sword L\u00ea L\u1ee3i revolted in 1418 against the Ming Dynasty, who had invaded and occupied Vietnam in 1407. Initially the military campaign against the Chinese was only moderately successful. While L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was able to operate in his home province of Thanh H\u00f3a, for the first 2\u20133 years, he was unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the Ming army in battle. As a result, he waged a guerrilla campaign against the large and well organized Chinese army. According to legend, to help L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, a local God, the Dragon King (Vietnamese: Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng) decided to lend his sword to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. But there was a catch; the sword did not come straight to him in one piece. It was split into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh H\u00f3a province, there was a fisherman named L\u00ea Th\u1eadn, who was not related to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something heavy. Thinking of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and not knowing what to do with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, L\u00ea Th\u1eadn joined the rebel army of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's home. L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (Will of Heaven). With L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's endorsement, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took the blade with him. One day, while on the run from the enemy, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i saw a strange light emanating from the branches of a banyan tree. He climbed up and there he found a hilt of a sword, encrusted with precious gems. Remembering the blade he found earlier, he took it out and placed it into the hilt. The fit was perfect. Believing that the Heaven had entrusted him with the great cause of freeing the land, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took up arms and rallied people under his banner. For the next few years, the magic sword brought him victory after another. His men no longer had to hide in the forest, but aggressively penetrated many enemy camps, captured them and seized their granaries. The sword helped them push back the enemy, until Vietnam was once again free from Chinese rule. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i ascended the throne in 1428, ending his 10-year campaign, and reclaimed independence for the country. A statue of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and his sword in Thanh H\u00f3a, Vietnam One year after ascending the throne, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was on a dragon boat cruising around H\u1ed3 L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y (Green Water Lake), directly in front of his palace. When they came to the middle of the lake, a giant turtle with a golden shell (Kim Qui) emerged from under the water surface. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i ordered the captain to slow down, and at the same time looked down to see that the magic sword on his belt was moving on its own. The golden turtle advanced toward the boat and the king, then with a human voice, it asked him to return the magic sword to his master, Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Dragon King), who lived under the water. It suddenly became clear to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i that the sword was only lent to him to carry out his duty, but now it must be returned to its rightful owner, lest it corrupt him. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i drew the sword out of its scabbard and lobbed it towards the turtle. With great speed, the turtle opened its mouth and snatched the sword from the air with its teeth. It descended back into the water, with the shiny sword in its mouth, and for a long period a flickering light was said to have been seen from beyond the muddled depths of the lake. From then on, people renamed that lake to H\u1ed3 G\u01b0\u01a1m (Sword Lake) or H\u1ed3 Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm (Lake of the Returned Sword). ==Historical analysis == A few historians believe that the Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean sword was an expedient of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's strategist Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, regarding it as a ploy to gain legitimacy for L\u00ea L\u1ee3i to lead an uprising against the Chinese. The expedient was successful, as the sword's legend quickly spread across the country, leading the populace to regard L\u00ea L\u1ee3i as the rightful ruler of Vietnam, especially among those with high levels of antipathy towards the Chinese, who were longstanding historical enemies of Vietnam. ==References== :Vietnamese *Viet Nam Tale Grade 5 (Truy\u1ec7n c\u1ed5 t\u00edch Vi\u1ec7t Nam l\u1edbp 5) - Gi\u00e1o D\u1ee5c Publisher, Vi\u1ec7t Nam - 1999. *Khu di t\u00edch T\u01b0\u1ee3ng vua L\u00ea Department of Tourism Hanoi. *C\u00e1c tri\u1ec1u \u0111\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t Nam - L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 Author: https://web.archive.org/web/20030203061114/http://lichsu.ttvn.net/ :English *L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (1385 -1433) Hanoi City Official Website. ==External links== *Vietnamese:L\u00ea L\u1ee3i V\u0103n H\u1ecdc \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t.
