    "text": "Excelsior Geyser Crater, formerly known as Excelsior Geyser, is a dormant fountain-type geyser in the Midway Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Excelsior was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. ==Description== The Excelsior Geyser pool discharges 4,000 to 4,500 gallons (15,100\u201317,000 l) of water per minute directly into the Firehole River. In the late 19th century (and possibly 1901), it was an active geyser that erupted frequently. Most eruptions were about 100 feet high, although some exceeded in both height and width. It is believed that the powerful eruptions damaged its internal plumbing system, and it now boils as a productive hot spring most of the time. ==Activity== In 1985, Excelsior returned to activity for a 46-hour period from September 14 to 16. These eruptions were relatively small at but a few were as much as tall and 100 feet wide. All of these eruptions lasted about 2 minutes at intervals of 5 to 66 minutes. Between 2004 and 2006, Excelsior did have violent boiling strong enough to be considered as eruptions. This boiling reached between and had a duration of seconds. {| | File:Excelsion geyser in 1890.jpg|Postcard after F.
