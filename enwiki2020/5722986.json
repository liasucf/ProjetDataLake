It was withdrawn from sale in the 1980s but was briefly re-launched as a limited edition by Nestl\u00e9 in 2005 during a wave of sweet-related nostalgia. A 2004 survey of sweet shops' customers rated the Texan bar their favourite sweet of all time, by a large margin. The advertisements for the Texan showed a cartoon cowboy, who was captured and tied to a stake. When asked if he had a last request he asked for a Texan bar which took him a long time to eat; meanwhile, the bandits fell asleep, ensuring his escape.
