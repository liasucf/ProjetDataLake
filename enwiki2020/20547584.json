    "text": "Bruce Edwin Hines (born 7 November 1957, in Pomona, California) is a Major League Baseball coach. As a player, Hines was a switch hitter who primarily played second base. He attended Bonita High School in La Verne, California, and played college baseball for the University of La Verne. He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 15th round of the 1979 amateur draft, but returned to La Verne where he was named First Team All-SCIAC in 1980. He was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 18th round of the 1980 amateur draft, but his playing career peaked at the high-A level. He managed teams in the California/Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels and Oakland Athletics minor league systems, and worked as minor-league field coordinator for the Angels before being named the third base coach for the Seattle Mariners. On 19 October 2009, the Mariners announced Hines would be the only member of their coaching staff not retained for the following season. He then spent a few years as the Dodgers' minor league field coordinator. Off the field, Hines had a brief appearance in the 1996 film The Fan, in which he played an umpire who was presumably killed by the film's lead character. ==References== ==External links== * Player statistics and biographical information at The Baseball Cube Category:1957 births Category:California Angels coaches Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Sportspeople from Pomona, California Category:Seattle Mariners coaches Category:Grays Harbor Loggers players Category:San Jose Missions players Category:Utica Blue Sox players Category:Madison Muskies players ",
