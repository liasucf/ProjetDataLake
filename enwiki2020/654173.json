    "text": "Campus radio (also known as college radio, university radio or student radio) is a type of radio station that is run by the students of a college, university or other educational institution. Programming may be exclusively by students, or may include programmers from the wider community in which the radio station is based. Sometimes campus radio stations are operated for the purpose of training professional radio personnel, sometimes with the aim of broadcasting educational programming, while other radio stations exist to provide alternative to commercial broadcasting or government broadcasters. Campus radio stations are generally licensed and regulated by national governments, and have very different characteristics from one country to the next. One commonality between many radio stations regardless of their physical location is a willingness\u2014or, in some countries, even a licensing requirement\u2014to broadcast musical selections that are not categorized as commercial hits. Because of this, campus radio has come to be associated with emerging musical trends, including genres such as punk and new wave, alternative rock, indie rock and hip hop, long before those genres become part of the musical mainstream. Campus radio stations also often provide airplay and promotional exposure to new and emerging local artists. Many campus radio stations carry a variety of programming including news (often local), sports (often relating to the campus), and spoken word programming as well as general music. Often the radio format is best described as a freeform, with much creativity and individualism among the disc jockeys and show hosts. Some of these radio stations have gained critical acclaim for their programming and are considered by the community in which they are embedded to be an essential media outlet. Although the term campus radio implies full-power AM or FM transmission over the air, many radio stations experiment with low-power broadcasting, closed circuit or carrier current systems, often to on-campus listeners only. Some radio stations are distributed through the cable television system on cable FM or the second audio program of a TV radio station. Some universities and colleges broadcast one or more Internet radio feeds\u2014either instead of, or in addition to a campus radio station\u2014which may differ in radio formats significantly from licensed traditional campus radio. ==Campus radio around the world== ===Argentina=== The most famous campus radio in the country, FM Radio Universidad (\"University Radio\"), is an Argentine radio station based in the city of Rosario, belonging to the National University of Rosario (UNR).

In Brazil, educational radios are prohibited from broadcast commercial advertising on its programming, except in the form of cultural support. According to the Brazilian Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (ABERT), in April 2013, Brazil had 466 educational radios.http://www.abert.org.br/web/index.php/dados-do- setor/estatisticas/radiodifusao-licencas-e-outorgas * USP FM \u2013 93.7 MHz \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 University of S\u00e3o Paulo * UNESP FM \u2013 105.7 MHz \u2013 Bauru \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo State University * FM Unitau \u2013 107.7 MHz \u2013 Taubat\u00e9 \u2013 University of Taubat\u00e9 * Universit\u00e1ria FM \u2013 104.7 MHz \u2013 Vit\u00f3ria \u2013 Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo * Udesc FM \u2013 100.1 MHz \u2013 Florian\u00f3polis \u2013 Santa Catarina State University * Universit\u00e1ria FM \u2013 107.9 MHz \u2013 Fortaleza \u2013 Federal University of Cear\u00e1 * R\u00e1dio da Universidade AM \u2013 1080 kHz \u2013 Porto Alegre \u2013 Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul * Mix FM \u2013 107.1 MHz \u2013 Canoas \u2013 Lutheran University of Brazil * UPF FM \u2013 99.9 MHz \u2013 Passo Fundo \u2013 University of Passo Fundo * UCS FM - 106.5 MHz \u2013 Caxias do Sul \u2013 University of Caxias do Sul * Unisinos FM \u2013 103.3 MHz \u2013 S\u00e3o Leopoldo \u2013 Sinos River Valley University * Univates FM \u2013 95.1 MHz \u2013 Lajeado \u2013 University of Taquari Valley * Uni FM \u2013 107.9 MHz \u2013 Santa Maria \u2013 Federal University of Santa Maria * Federal FM \u2013 107.9 MHz \u2013 Pelotas \u2013 Federal University of Pelotas * URI FM \u2013 106.1 MHz \u2013 Santiago \u2013 Integrated Regional University of Upper Uruguay and Missions * Universit\u00e1ria FM \u2013 99.9 MHz \u2013 Recife \u2013 Federal University of Pernambuco * Universit\u00e1ria FM \u2013 95.9 MHz \u2013 Boa Vista \u2013 Federal University of Roraima * Universit\u00e1ria AM \u2013 870 kHz \u2013 Goi\u00e2nia \u2013 Federal University of Goi\u00e1s ===Brunei Darussalam=== UBD FM is the first university-based radio station in Brunei Darussalam. The student-run organisation operates under the Educational and Technology Center of the Universiti Brunei Darussalam and was established in 2008. ===Canada=== In Canada, radio stations are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which provides that \"a campus radio station is a radio station owned or controlled by a not-for-profit organization associated with a post-secondary educational institution\". The CRTC distinguishes two types of campus radio: instructional (for training of professional broadcasters) and community-based campus (programming provided by volunteers who are not training to be professionals). The community-based radio format is the predominant one, colloquially known as \"campus-community radio.\" In recent years, some community-based campus radio stations, including CFFF-FM in Peterborough and CJMQ-FM in Sherbrooke, have in fact had their CRTC licenses formally reclassified from campus radio to community radio. Campus radio stations broadcasting at full power are assigned a permanent frequency and call letters and, aside from a requirement not to compete directly with commercial radio stations, are full players in the Canadian broadcasting spectrum. Campus radio stations in Canada are more commonly associated with universities than with colleges, although some colleges also have licensed campus radio stations. As well, some institutions maintain unlicensed campus radio operations which broadcast only by closed circuit, cable FM or Internet streaming. Also see United States section for more general information. Canada's oldest community-based campus radio station is CFRC at Queen's University in Kingston, which has been on the air since 1923; it began as a commercial radio station and a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation affiliate, but became the country's first university-owned station in 1942 and fully transitioned to a campus radio station in 1957. CJRT-FM, a campus radio station of the instructional type, has been on air since 1949. The CRTC places responsibilities upon campus radio stations in Canada through the use of conditions of license that radio stations must follow in order to keep broadcasting. Campus radio stations, for example, are expected to be leaders in the Canadian content system which mandates a minimum number of Canadian musical selections throughout the day. The minimum Canadian content required for a campus station is 35%. Individual programs have their own requirements which depend on a particular program's content category. Generally, for popular music programs (pop, rock, dance, country-oriented, acoustic, and easy listening), hosts must play a minimum of 35% Canadian content. Programs featuring Special Interest Music (concert, folk-oriented, world, blues, jazz, non-classic religious and experimental) must have at least 12% Canadian content. In early 2005, Humber College's radio station CKHC-FM became the first broadcast radio station in Canada to air 100% Canadian content. Other requirements generally made of campus radio stations include quotas of non- hit, folk and ethnic musical selections as well as spoken word programming. Most campus radio stations in Canada are members of the National Campus and Community Radio Association. On January 23, 2012, the CRTC announced it would be eliminating instructional radio stations.Future staticky for KICK-FM. Winnipeg Free Press. Retrieved January 24, 2012. ===Denmark=== There are five student radio stations in Denmark related to the largest universities in Denmark. Only the town of Roskilde has a university and no permanent radio, but every year the five existing student radio stations work together in producing 10 days of radio on the Roskilde festival. The project is a cooperation between all the student radios organized by the cooperation organization called DDS and could be considered a temporary radio station. The five student radio stations in Denmark are listed below with the city they relate to in Denmark. * Universitetsradioen in Copenhagen * XFM Lyngby in Lyngby * Odense studenterradio in Odense * Arhus studenterradio in \u00c5rhus * Aalborg studenterradio in Aalborg All the radios broadcast radio in local frequencies on FM in their related city. XFM actually has two departments one in Copenhagen and one in Lyngby and is the only radio who has two broadcast licenses. The only one of the radio stations which broadcasts radio directly on campus is Aalborg studentradio. As many of the American studentradio Aalborg has speaker directly on the university where they can broadcast radio to the students cad Campus Rdio AAU. ===France=== Radio Campus France is a national, non-profit radio broadcasting network grouping 22 public college radio stations located in the largest French cities. Acting as an umbrellas for college radio in French public Universities, it proves that there is strength in numbers, and that music, technology and education are natural bedfellows. Not just a collection of disparate elements, Radio Campus is a vocal leader in the areas of digital broadcasting, keeping tabs on the development of terrestrial radio, as well as developing new network interfaces for radio stations across the nation to share content. With a broad music program, the playlist is powered by the passion of fans, and heralds a modern way for groups to interact in the social web. Whether through their support of regular residency shows from the likes of Beats In Space, or Warp Records, or broadcasting live from Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festival in Sete, it is the love of the music which connects the listeners, and that makes Radio Campus a unique and special group indeed. The Radio Campus France radio stations include: * Amiens \u2013 Radio Campus Amiens 88.7 * Angers \u2013 Radio Campus Angers 103.0 * Besan\u00e7on \u2013 Radio Campus Besan\u00e7on 102.4 * Bordeaux \u2013 Radio Campus Bordeaux 88.1 * Brest \u2013 Radio-U 101.1 * Caen \u2013 Radio Ph\u00e9nix 92.7 * Clermont- Ferrand \u2013 Radio Campus Clermont-Ferrand 93.3 * Dijon \u2013 Radio Dijon Campus 92.2 * Grenoble \u2013 Radio Campus Grenoble 90.8 * Lille \u2013 Radio Campus Lille 106.6 * Lyon \u2013 Radio Brume 90.7 * Marseille \u2013 Radio Grenouille 88.8 * Montpellier \u2013 Radio Campus Montpellier 102.2 * Orl\u00e9ans \u2013 Radio Campus Orl\u00e9ans 88.3 * Paris \u2013 Radio Campus Paris 93.9 * Rennes \u2013 Radio Campus Rennes 88.4 * Strasbourg \u2013 Radio En Construction 90.7 * Toulouse \u2013 Radio Campus Toulouse 94.0 * Tours \u2013 Radio Campus Tours 99.5 The Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des radios de grandes \u00e9coles is the national non-profit network unifying 46 internet radios in the Grandes Ecoles, higher education establishments outside the main framework of the French university system, specialised schools spread in more than twenty cities: schools of business, engineering or political science for example.

News, as of November 2006, has it that the India cabinet decided to grant permission to non-profit organizations and educational institutions to set up community radio stations. The cabinet decision will allow civil society and voluntary organizations, state agriculture universities and institutions, Krishi Vigyan Kendras or agricultural science centres, registered societies and autonomous boards and public trusts registered under Societies Act to start community radio stations. Broadcast Engineering Consultants of India is a government owned corporation that helps setup of Community FM radio stations in India. Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then Minister for Information and Broadcasting in the government, told India's upper house of parliament the Rajya Sabha on December 22, 2003, that four organizations including Jammu University and Kashmir University were found ineligible for grant of license as per the laid down guidelines. The minister also ruled out any review of the policy despite limited response to the non-commercial, low-powered FM radio scheme which former information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj had said would \"revolutionize\" radio broadcast in the country. Radio enthusiast Alokesh Gupta saying: \"The announcement of the Government was to have seen 1000 radio stations by December 2003. Instead administrative wrangling came in the way of implementing the project as colleges spent time running around for licenses and approval from four ministries \u2014 Home Affairs, Communications & Information & Broadcasting \u2014 as they took their time processing applications.\" On February 2, 2004, Anna University in Chennai unveiled the country's first campus radio station, Anna FM. Radio Ujjas in Kutch (in the western state of Gujarat) is one such CR and gets its funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Central Government. Similarly a community based radio programme titled Panchayat Vani (People's Voice) was recently broadcast on All India Radio (AIR), Darbhanga, Bihar. The campus radio station Gyanvaani has also been licensed. Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences established a community radio station, Radio Adan (90.4 Mhz) in 2008, which brings together experts, students, farmers and local population, through various popular programmes, focussing on agriculture, education, employment, women empowerment, child marriage, health and culture.https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/Community%20Radio%20Compendium%202019.pdf Pune University is the first university in the state of Maharashtra to have an FM radio station. The University of Pune's FM Radio inaugurated on May 1, 2005, has been named as Vidyavani. It covers a wide range of subjects, focusing specifically on the requirements of students of various departments and affiliated colleges. It reaches an area around the campus within eight-km radius. Unsuccessful attempts have been also made to start CR without obtaining any permission. The small village of Orvakal in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh (South India) launched \"Mana Radio\" (Our Radio) in November 2002. This project run under the aegis of the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty used a tiny transmitter that covered a radius of half a kilometer to enable rural women members of self-help groups. Four months later, officials from the Central Government brought in police to seize the equipment and declared the broadcasts illegal. The Government policy to permit educational institutions to have their own FM Channels at low frequency levels emerged in mid December 2002, as a result of years of campaigning by activists and a strongly worded Supreme Court judgment directing the opening up of the airwaves. A unique experiment in using media technologies, especially radio, for development and empowerment of marginalized, rural communities is the community radio initiative \"Chalo Ho Gaon Mein\" a programme that is broadcast once a week on AIR Daltonganj in the Palamu district of Jharkhand, eastern India. This radio programme is supported by the National Foundation for India and produced by Community representatives, of Alternative for India Development (AID), a non-governmental organization. School of Communication of Manipal also has its own campus radio. According to the terms of the campus broad license, a number of aspects are disallowed from broadcasts. This includes anything that offends good taste or decency, contains criticism of friendly countries, contains an attack on religion, contains anything obscene, defamatory, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths, likely to encourage or incite violence, contains anything affecting the integrity of the nation, criticizes, maligns or slanders any individual in person, encourages superstition or blind belief, denigrates women, denigrates children, or presents or depicts or suggests as desirable the misuse of drugs, alcohol, narcotics, and tobacco. ===Indonesia=== Radio Syiar FM, Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Alauddin, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

It exists since 1993 and is broadcasting on the internet and CATV network on FM 94.55 MHz in Lausanne and region. In the past Fr\u00e9quence banane has broadcast with former Radio Acidule from 1992 to 1996 and then had its independent FM transmitter operating on 92.4 MHz from 1998 to 2005. In 2005, Swiss frequency regulation authority (BAKOM) decided to end the low power FM licence. Radio Radius is an uprising campus radio in Z\u00fcrich on ETHZ and UNIZH campus. It's broadcasting on the Internet only. Radius is trying to get a permanent licence to broadcast on FM but it is very hard in Zurich. Right now Radius is negotiating with BAKOM. ===Tunisia=== Radio Campus Tunis Radio Campus Tunis powered by Disk Red Association is a non-profit Student radio station powered by Disk Red Association. Founded in 2014 and broadcasting on the Internet since 21 June 2016, the radio can be listened from 6.00 a.m. to 4.00 a.m on www.radiocampustunis.radiostream321.com . Managed by volunteers (mainly students), this radio focuses on emerging local music and student-related matters. ===Turkey=== * Radyo Bilkent on Bilkent University * Radyo \u00c7ankaya on \u00c7ankaya University * KU Radyo on Ko\u00e7 University * RadyoSU on Sabanc\u0131 University * Radyo ODT\u00dc on Middle East Technical University * \u00c7OM\u00dc Kamp\u00fcs FM on \u00c7anakkale Onsekiz Mart University * Radyo \u00d6z\u00dc on \u00d6zye\u011fin University * Radyo Arel on Istanbul Arel University ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom, campus radio is generally referred to as 'student radio'. Founded in 1960, the University of Hertfordshire's Campus Radio Hatfield (now Crush Radio) was the UK's first student radio station, though it was a pirate radio station. This was followed by the first legal station, Radio Heslington (now University Radio York) in 1967, Swansea University's Action Radio (now Xtreme Radio) in 1968, Stirling University's University Radio Airthrey (now Air3 Radio) from 1970, University of Essex's University Radio Essex in 1971, and Loughborough University's Loughborough Campus Radio in 1973. Some student radio stations operate on the FM waveband for short periods at a time under the Restricted Service Licence scheme, while others choose to broadcast full-time on the AM waveband using an LPAM licence. There are only five UK student radio stations permitted to broadcast all year on LPFM. These are Xpression FM (Exeter), Radio Roseland (Truro, Cornwall), Storm FM (Bangor), Bailrigg FM (Lancaster) and 1386 HCR (Halesowen College). None of these licences provides for a reception area greater than four kilometres from the point of transmission. To counteract these licence restrictions and, in the case of AM broadcasts, poor quality audio, many radio stations simulcast on the Internet. The UK Student Radio Association works on behalf of more than fifty UK-based member radio stations to further their development, encourage and facilitate communication between member radio stations and links to the commercial radio industry, and lobby for the membership's interests on both a regional and national level. The association organises and hosts the annual Student Radio Awards in conjunction with BBC Radio 1. See also List of radio stations in the United Kingdom ===United States=== College radio (as it is generally known in the United States) became commonplace in the 1960s when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began issuing class D licenses for ten-watt radio stations to further the development of the then new FM band. Some colleges had already been broadcasting for decades on the AM band, often originating in physics experiments in the early 20th century. One of the first college radio stations in the country is WRUC from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Its first experimental audio broadcasts under the call sign 2YU were in 1916.\"Union College\", Education's Own Stations by S. E. Frost, Jr., Ph.D., 1937, pages 437\u2013441. Regular programing for the public under call sign 2ADD began in 1920. Letter from UCRC to QST Magazine WHUS, (the UConn HUSkies), the radio station of the University of Connecticut went on the air as WABL, a 100-watt AM radio station, in 1922 with two 103-foot (31 m) steel towers serving as the radio station's antennae. In 1925 power increased to 500-watts and the call letters changed to WCAC (Connecticut Agricultural College, at that time the name of the university). Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida started WDBO (Way Down By Orlando) in 1924. WDBO was given away by Rollins College in 1926. College radio returned to Rollins College when the FM radio station, WPRK began broadcasting on December 10, 1952. Most of the FM radio stations received higher-class licenses than ten watts, typically a few hundred watts. A few got several kilowatts, and a small handful got licenses in the range of tens of thousands, sometimes reaching up to maximum-power 100-kilowatt outlets. WRAS 88.5 FM and WREK 91.1 FM in Atlanta are the most powerful college radio station, operating at 100,000 watts. Still, due to strict class D regulations, some radio stations were prohibited from a wattage upgrade for possible signal interference with adjacent radio stations, such as KWUR 90.3 FM interfering with KWMU 90.7 FM in St. Louis, Missouri. KTUH 90.3 FM in Honolulu, Hawaii has had many increases in its wattage since they started broadcasting at 10 watts as a Non-commercial educational FM radio station in 1969. In 1984 KTUH received permission from the board of regents to increase to 100 watts of power. More recently, in 2001, KTUH began transmitting at 3000 watts of power. KTUH is heard on an island wide frequency in Honolulu, Hawaii from 90.1 FM, as well as online at KTUH.ORG and on digital cable channel 866. The earliest college radio stations carried news, intercollegiate sports, and music along with educational shows and sometimes distance learning courses. In the latter portion of the 20th century, many U.S. radio stations played what came to be known as \"college rock\" (later known as alternative rock), a type of rock music that had not yet hit the mainstream. Most radio stations have now diversified, with many following a very commercial-like music rotation during the weekdays, and having specialty shows on evenings and weekends. A few radio stations still employ a freeform programming. College radio stations are typically considered to be public radio radio stations in the way that they are funded by donation and grants, but as a radio format the term \"Public radio\" generally refers to classical music, jazz, and news. A more accurate term is community radio, as most staff are volunteers, although many radio stations limit staff to current or recent students instead of anyone from the local community. By the late 1970s, FM had taken off, and competition for channels for new radio stations was intensifying. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the newly founded National Public Radio (NPR) convinced the FCC that local low-power radio stations were somehow detrimental to broadcasting, and class D licenses were no longer issued for applications made after 1979, except for broadcast translators to repeat NAB and NPR members' radio stations. Making matters worse for the college stations, they were demoted to secondary status, meaning that they could be forced to downgrade or go silent if a full-power station chose to upgrade or to relocate closer to the college station. Many radio stations were forced to upgrade their facilities at considerable expense. Many other radio stations were eventually forced off the air, because they could not afford the upgrades at all, or not in time to avoid being locked in by other expanding radio stations. There have also been situations where some college radio stations have been forced off the air either temporarily or permanently by the school's administration. Many college radio stations in the U.S. also carry syndicated programming, such as that of National Public Radio and affiliated regional networks. Some radio stations have had student programming taken off the air by the administration in favor of other uses, such as WWGC and KTXT. The original WGST was the subject of an involuntary takeover which saw the state's board of regents sell the radio station as \"surplus\" property. A few radio stations have been added to the airwaves as the result of LPFM licensing in the U.S. One example of a Campus Radio station licensed as an LPFM is WIUX-LP of Indiana University, which is able to cover the entire city with its LPFM signal and is competitive in listenership numbers to nearby higher-powered commercial radio stations. Another example of this is WDSW-LP at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. WDSW-LP fully covers its community with a AAA/roots driven format unserved by other local broadcasters. A number of campus radio stations in the US are available using alternate means such as streaming audio over the Internet. Though continuing to broadcast traditionally over the air at 88.5FM, William Penn University's station KWPU in Oskaloosa, IA streams using RadioBOSS. Another such example is DePaul University. Another example is WJHU at Johns Hopkins University. Some radio stations use a variety of methods, such as Loyola University Chicago's WLUW, Lewis University's WLRA (The Start), University of Michigan's WCBN-FM and Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University's WIKD-LP who use terrestrial FM, streaming, and mobile media apps. Michigan State University's WDBM (\"The Impact\"), University of Minnesota's KUOM (\"Radio K\"), and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's WSUM. All three radio stations broadcast traditionally and via online streaming internet radio. WWEC of Elizabethtown College streams online as well. ===Uruguay=== In 2006, the University of the Republic from Uruguay got the permits to host its own radio in the frequency 89.1 FM, which is controlled by its own team and students. hihgly informative and authentic ==See also== * High school radio * Indie radio * List of campus radio stations * Low-power broadcasting * Modern rock (Alternative radio) * UK Student Radio Association == References == Category:College radio stations in the United States Category:Radio formats Category:University and college mass media in the United States ",
