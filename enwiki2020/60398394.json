The Cornhuskers were led by first-year coach head coach Fred Hoiberg and play their home games at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska as members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 7\u201325, 2\u201318 in Big Ten play to finish in last place. They lost to Indiana in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament which was subsequently canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the final game of the season against Indiana, Fred Hoiberg appeared ill during the game, left the game in the second half, and was taken to the hospital. He was tested for coronavirus due to the ongoing pandemic, but he was diagnosed with influenza. As a result of Hoiberg's sickness, the team was quarantined in the locker room following the Indiana game for a short period of time. ==Previous season== The Cornhuskers finished the 2017\u201318 season 19\u201317, 6\u201314 in Big Ten play to finish second-to-last. As the No. 13 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, they made a run but lost in the quarterfinals to Wisconsin. Despite winning 13 Big Ten games, the Cornhuskers received a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. They won in the first round of the NIT to Mississippi State but lost in the second round to TCU. Following the season, head coach Tim Miles was fired, having lead the team after seven seasons. Four days later, the school hired former Chicago Bulls' head coach Fred Hoiberg as the next head coach of the program. ==Offseason== Due to a change in coaching staff, Nebraska experienced a near-complete overhaul of its roster, retaining only two players from the previous season (only one of which had seen any playing time for Nebraska).http://collegehoopswatch.com/2019/10/06/nebraska- basketball-the-mayor-presides-over-a-total-roster-revamp/ The rebuilt team took an exhibition trip to Italy; a documentary on the trip was filmed by the Big Ten Network.https://btn.com/2019/10/21/btn-to-premiere-the-b1g-trip- nebraska-basketball-in-italy-on-monday-oct-28/ ===Departures=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !
