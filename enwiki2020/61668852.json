    "text": "Stracathro railway station served the sparsely populated rural area around the villages of Stracathro and Inchbare as well as Dunlappie and other estates in Angus, Scotland from 1896 to 1964 on the Brechin and Edzell District Railway. The station was opened as Inchbare and then renamed Dunlappie before finally being named Stracathro. == History == The Edzell Branch The station opened to goods on 1 June 1896 and to passengers on 8 June 1896 on the Brechin and Edzell District Railway as Inchbare.Wignal (1983), Page 62 It was the only intermediate stop on the line to Edzell that had been built by the Forfar and Brechin Railway(F&BR;)company but operated by the Caledonian Railway. The F&BR; remained independent until the 1923 grouping when it was incorporated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The station, along with the line, originally closed to passengers on 27 April 1931. A resumunption of train services was trialed on 4 July 1938 but ceased two months later, on 27 September 1938, due to lack of patronage by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The station and line finally closed to goods traffic on 7 September 1964. ==Infrastucture== The station had a single platform on the eastern side of the line. A level crossing stood to the north, just beyond the passing loop, with a gate box for the operator and a footbridge to the station for use when the level crossing was closed to road traffic. The signal box stood on the western side about half way along the passing loop. In 1921 the loop became a siding with part of the western lifted and the approach made from the south. A station workers house stood near the level crossing.Forfarshire XX.13. Edzell; Menmuir; Stracathro. Publication date: 1924. Revised: 1922.
