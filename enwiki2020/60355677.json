    "text": "The Sopron\u2013K\u0151szeg railway line, also known as Burgerlandbahn, is a railway line formerly connecting Sopron and K\u0151szeg, two towns in western Hungary, through Burgenland. It is a single-track partly electrified line, operated by \u00d6BB (passenger trains) and GySEV (goods trains). Its only connection to the rest of the \u00d6BB network currently is through Sopron. Operations on most of the track (between Deutschkreutz and K\u0151szeg) have been ceased in a few stages. As the Iron Curtain has cut off Hungary from Austria, passenger traffic between Rattersdorf-Liebing and K\u0151szeg had to be stopped on 6 October 1951, with goods trains no longer operating since 1 September 1960 on, with only corridor traffic being allowed. The track from Oberloisdorf in the direction of Hungary has been dismantled on 28 April 1969. All traffic between Deutschkreutz and Oberloisdorf stopped on 15 December 2013. == Gallery == File:Unterpetersdorf- Bf-02.jpg|Unterpetersdorf station File:Neckenmarkt-Horitschon- Bf-02.jpg|Neckenmarkt-Horitschon station File:Stoob-Bf-03.jpg|Stoob station File:Oberpullendorf-Bf-05.jpg|Oberpullendorf station File:Als\u00f3pulya \u00e1llom\u00e1s.JPG|Former Unterpullendorf station File:Oberloisdorf - Bahnhof der Burgenlandbahn.jpg|Oberloisdorf station File:Oberloisdorf_- _Streckenende_der_Burgenlandbahn.jpg|End of the track in Oberloisdorf == External links == Category:International railway lines Category:Railway lines in Austria Category:Railway lines in Hungary Category:Sopron Category:K\u0151szeg Category:Austria\u2013Hungary relations ",
