    "text": "The white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) is an endangered species of bearded saki, a type of New World monkey, endemic to the south-central Amazon rainforest in Brazil and possibly a small area east of Bolivia. Both its scientific and common name were caused by the authors working from dead specimens, where the skin on and around the nose fades to whitish. In living individuals, it is actually bright pink (though with fine barely visible white hairs), and the pelage is black.Photo of C. albinasus. Saxifraga.de.
