    "text": "Disney Magic Kingdoms is a freemium video game for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows developed by Gameloft. It is a world builder game themed off Disney Parks around the world. It was officially launched on 17 March 2016. ==Storyline== The game takes place in the Kingdom, a place primarily based on Disneyland. When Maleficent casts an evil spell on the Kingdom, ridding it of all its powerful magic, you have to help it get back, creating your own park. ==Gameplay== Progressing through the storyline the player unlocks more characters and attractions. Players can earn Magic and Experience by sending characters on quests and tasks, and sometimes Tokens to unlock or level up characters. Premium characters and attractions are unlocked using Gems, which are earned by leveling up characters, completing character collections, or viewing daily announcements. The game also features chests, occasionally hidden in the Kingdom, but also can be bought for Gems, which award different prizes depending on the type of chest, such as attractions, Tokens, decorations, or concessions. Also in the game is Merlin's Shop, in which the player can obtain Tokens and attractions through Elixirs, which are obtained by exchanging them for decorations and concessions in Merlin's cauldron. The game also includes floats based on each franchise, which grant Magic, Tokens or Gems through parades. Playing during Events can unlock limited-time characters and attractions. Once the Events are over, this content occasionally returns in limited-time chests. Some characters also have costumes, which can be obtained through Tokens, Gems, or as a prize at an Event. ==Franchises in the game== ===Permanent=== The franchises in the permanent storyline of the game with unlockable characters include: *The Sword in the Stone *Mickey and Friends *DuckTales *Toy Story *Cinderella *Star Wars *Peter Pan *Pirates of the Caribbean *Monsters, Inc. *WALL-E *Tangled *Sleeping Beauty *Zootopia *Bambi *The Jungle Book *Lady and the Tramp *Dumbo *Pocahontas *The Emperor's New Groove ===Limited-time=== The franchises in the game with unlockable characters during Events or limited-time offers include: *The Incredibles *Nightmare Before Christmas *Frozen *Mulan *Beauty and the Beast *The Lion King *Aladdin *Alice in Wonderland *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs *Winnie the Pooh *Lilo & Stitch *Big Hero 6 *The Little Mermaid *Wreck- It Ralph *The Princess and the Frog *Moana *Finding Nemo *Coco *Haunted Mansion *Star Wars (sequel trilogy) *Onward *Hercules ==References== ==External links== *Disney Magic Kingdoms at Gameloft Category:2017 video games Category:Disney video games Category:Gameloft games Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Metafictional video games Category:City-building games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring parallel universes Category:Video games set in amusement parks Category:Single-player video games ",
