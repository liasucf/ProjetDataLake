    "text": "In probability theory, the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma is a theorem about sequences of events. In general, it is a result in measure theory. It is named after \u00c9mile Borel and Francesco Paolo Cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.E. Borel, \"Les probabilit\u00e9s d\u00e9nombrables et leurs applications arithmetiques\" Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo (2) 27 (1909) pp. 247\u2013271.F.P. Cantelli, \"Sulla probabilit\u00e0 come limite della frequenza\", Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei 26:1 (1917) pp.39\u201345. A related result, sometimes called the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma. The lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. Accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. Other examples include Kolmogorov's zero\u2013one law and the Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law. ==Statement of lemma for probability spaces== Let E1,E2,... be a sequence of events in some probability space. The Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma states: :If the sum of the probabilities of the En is finite ::\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Pr(E_n)<\\infty, :then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 0, that is, ::\\Pr\\left(\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} E_n\\right) = 0. Here, \"lim sup\" denotes limit supremum of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. That is, lim sup En is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (En). Explicitly, :\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} E_n = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k \\geq n}^\\infty E_k. The set lim sup En is sometimes denoted {En i.o. }. The theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events En is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are \"repeated\" infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. Note that no assumption of independence is required. ===Example=== Suppose (Xn) is a sequence of random variables with Pr(Xn = 0) = 1/n2 for each n. The probability that Xn = 0 occurs for infinitely many n is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many [Xn = 0] events. The intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. However, the sum \u2211Pr(Xn = 0) converges to 2/6 \u2248 1.645 < \u221e, and so the Borel\u2013Cantelli Lemma states that the set of outcomes that are common to infinitely many such events occurs with probability zero. Hence, the probability of Xn = 0 occurring for infinitely many n is 0\\. Almost surely (i.e., with probability 1), Xn is nonzero for all but finitely many n. == Proof == Let (En) be a sequence of events in some probability space. The sequence of events \\left\\\\{\\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty E_n\\right\\\\}^\\infty_{N=1} is non-increasing: :\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty E_n \\supseteq \\bigcup_{n=2}^\\infty E_n \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq \\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty E_n \\supseteq \\bigcup_{n=N+1}^\\infty E_n \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} E_n. By continuity from above, :\\Pr(\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} E_n) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\Pr\\left(\\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty E_n\\right). By subadditivity, :\\Pr\\left(\\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty E_n\\right) \\leq \\sum^\\infty_{n=N} \\Pr(E_n). By original assumption, \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Pr(E_n)<\\infty. As the series \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Pr(E_n) converges, :\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\sum^\\infty_{n=N} \\Pr(E_n)=0, as required. ==General measure spaces== For general measure spaces, the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma takes the following form: :Let \u03bc be a (positive) measure on a set X, with \u03c3-algebra F, and let (An) be a sequence in F. If ::\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\mu(A_n)<\\infty, :then ::\\mu\\left(\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} A_n\\right) = 0. ==Converse result== A related result, sometimes called the second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma. The lemma states: If the events En are independent and the sum of the probabilities of the En diverges to infinity, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. That is: :: If \\sum^{\\infty}_{n = 1} \\Pr(E_n) = \\infty and the events (E_n)^{\\infty}_{n = 1} are independent, then \\Pr(\\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} E_n) = 1. The assumption of independence can be weakened to pairwise independence, but in that case the proof is more difficult. ===Example=== The infinite monkey theorem is a special case of this lemma. The lemma can be applied to give a covering theorem in Rn. Specifically , if Ej is a collection of Lebesgue measurable subsets of a compact set in Rn such that :\\sum_j \\mu(E_j) = \\infty, then there is a sequence Fj of translates :F_j = E_j + x_j such that :\\lim\\sup F_j = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{k=n}^\\infty F_k = \\mathbb{R}^n apart from a set of measure zero. ==Proof == Suppose that \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\Pr(E_n) = \\infty and the events (E_n)^\\infty_{n = 1} are independent. It is sufficient to show the event that the En's did not occur for infinitely many values of n has probability 0\\. This is just to say that it is sufficient to show that : 1-\\Pr(\\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} E_n) = 0. Noting that: :\\begin{align} 1 - \\Pr(\\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} E_n) &= 1 - \\Pr\\left(\\\\{E_n\\text{ i.o.}\\\\}\\right) = \\Pr\\left(\\\\{E_n \\text{ i.o.}\\\\}^c \\right) \\\\\\ & = \\Pr\\left(\\left(\\bigcap_{N=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty E_n\\right)^c \\right) = \\Pr\\left(\\bigcup_{N=1}^\\infty \\bigcap_{n=N}^\\infty E_n^c \\right)\\\\\\ &= \\Pr\\left(\\liminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}E_n^{c}\\right)= \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty}\\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{n=N}^\\infty E_n^c \\right) \\end{align} it is enough to show: \\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{n=N}^{\\infty}E_n^{c}\\right) = 0. Since the (E_n)^{\\infty}_{n = 1} are independent: :\\begin{align} \\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{n=N}^\\infty E_n^c\\right) &= \\prod^\\infty_{n=N} \\Pr(E_n^c) \\\\\\ &= \\prod^\\infty_{n=N} (1-\\Pr(E_n)) \\\\\\ &\\leq\\prod^\\infty_{n=N} \\exp(-\\Pr(E_n))\\\\\\ &=\\exp\\left(-\\sum^\\infty_{n=N} \\Pr(E_n)\\right)\\\\\\ &= 0. \\end{align} This completes the proof. Alternatively, we can see \\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{n=N}^\\infty E_n^c \\right) = 0 by taking negative the logarithm of both sides to get: : \\begin{align} -\\log\\left(\\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{n=N}^{\\infty}E_n^{c}\\right)\\right) &= -\\log\\left(\\prod^{\\infty}_{n=N} (1-\\Pr(E_n))\\right) \\\\\\ &= - \\sum^\\infty_{n=N}\\log(1-\\Pr(E_n)). \\end{align} Since \u2212log(1 \u2212 x) \u2265 x for all x > 0, the result similarly follows from our assumption that \\sum^\\infty_{n = 1} \\Pr(E_n) = \\infty. == Counterpart == Another related result is the so- called counterpart of the Borel-Cantelli lemma. It is a counterpart of the Lemma in the sense that it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the limsup to be 1 by replacing the independence assumption by the completely different assumption that (A_n) is monotone increasing for sufficiently large indices. This Lemma says: Let (A_n) be such that A_k \\subseteq A_{k+1}, and let \\bar A denote the complement of A. Then the probability of infinitely many A_k occur (that is, at least one A_k occurs) is one if and only if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers ( t_k) such that : \\sum_k \\Pr( A_{t_{k+1}} \\mid \\bar A_{t_k}) = \\infty. This simple result can be useful in problems such as for instance those involving hitting probabilities for stochastic process with the choice of the sequence (t_k) usually being the essence. ==Kochen\u2013Stone== Let A_n be a sequence of events with \\sum\\Pr(A_n)=\\infty and \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{1\\le m,n \\le k} \\Pr(A_m\\cap A_n)} {\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^k\\Pr(A_n)\\right)^2} <\\infty, then there is a positive probability that A_n occur infinitely often. ==See also== * L\u00e9vy's zero\u2013one law * Kuratowski convergence * Infinite monkey theorem ==References == * * . * . * . * Durrett, Rick. \"Probability: Theory and Examples.\" Duxbury advanced series, Third Edition, Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005. ==External links== * Planet Math Proof Refer for a simple proof of the Borel Cantelli Lemma Category:Theorems in measure theory Category:Probability theorems Category:Covering lemmas Category:Lemmas ",
