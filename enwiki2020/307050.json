    "text": "Jana Novotn\u00e1 (; 2 October 1968 \u2013 19 November 2017) was a professional tennis player from the Czech Republic. She played a serve and volley game, an increasingly rare style of play among women during her career. She won the women's singles title at Wimbledon in 1998 and was runner-up in three previous Grand Slam tournaments. Novotn\u00e1 also won 12 Grand Slam women's doubles titles (completing the Career Grand Slam twice), four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, and three Olympic medals. She reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 in 1997, and held the No. 1 ranking in doubles for 67 non- consecutive weeks. ==Career== Jana Novotn\u00e1 turned professional in February 1987. In the early years of her career, she was known primarily for her success as a doubles player. In the early 1990s, Novotn\u00e1 began to have success in singles once four-time Grand Slam singles champion Hana Mandl\u00edkov\u00e1 became her coach. Mandl\u00edkov\u00e1 would coach her for nine years. Previously she had been coached by Mike Estep. ===1990=== At the 1990 French Open, Novotn\u00e1, seeded 11th, achieved her best results in Grand Slam singles play up until that point. Having reached the round of 16, she faced Argentinian Gabriela Sabatini (seeded fourth). In their four previous meetings, Sabatini got the best of Novotn\u00e1 in three of those matches, including two straight set wins. This time proved to be different, as Novotn\u00e1 turned the tables against Sabatini. Although Novotn\u00e1 had disposed of Sabatini, she would have to face yet another difficult opponent in the quarterfinals, Katerina Maleeva (seeded eighth) from Bulgaria. In their two previous meetings Novotn\u00e1 had lost both times, and after Maleeva won the opening set, it appeared Novotn\u00e1 was about to lose a third consecutive time to Maleeva. However, Novotn\u00e1 came back to defeat Katerina Maleeva. Despite her success, Novotn\u00e1's toughest test would be against top seeded Steffi Graf of Germany in the semifinals. When Novotn\u00e1 faced Graf three years before at the 1987 French Open, Graf won in straight sets. Graf again defeated Novotn\u00e1 without dropping a set. She qualified for the first time for the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships in which she was beaten in the first round by Sabatini. She finished the year ranked No. 13. ===1991=== Novotn\u00e1 enjoyed an excellent start to the 1991 season at the Australian Open, where she was seeded 10th and beat Zina Garrison-Jackson 7\u20136, 6\u20134 in the round of 16 to advance to the quarterfinal. The path to the final became considerably more difficult, as Novotn\u00e1 had to contend with top seeded Steffi Graf in the quarterfinal encounter. In their ten previous meetings, Novotn\u00e1 had lost each time against Graf. But this time Novotn\u00e1 pulled the upset of her life by defeating Graf, the reigning champion of the last three years, 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 8\u20136. Now just one win away from her first ever Grand Slam final, Novotn\u00e1 would have to stop Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario in the semifinals to get there. Novotn\u00e1 defeated S\u00e1nchez Vicario, setting up a showdown against Monica Seles in the final. Seles eventually won in three sets. At the end of the year Novotn\u00e1 was ranked No. 7. ===1993=== Two years later, at Wimbledon, Novotn\u00e1's game hit full stride, as she played some of her finest tennis ever. But for Novotn\u00e1 (seeded eighth) to capture the title, her path would have to go through Sabatini (seeded fourth), Martina Navratilova (seeded second) and top-seeded Steffi Graf. Going into her quarterfinal against Sabatini, Novotn\u00e1 had lost six consecutive matches against the Argentine. This time, Novotn\u00e1 took Sabatini apart in straight sets, prevailing 6\u20134, 6\u20133. After Novotn\u00e1 defeated Sabatini, she then set her sights on a semifinal clash against Martina Navartilova, who had won each of their previous five matches. However, Novotn\u00e1 defeated Navratilova, setting up the Championship match against Graf. After losing a tight first set, Novotn\u00e1 took the second set and then had a game-point serving at 4\u20131 in the third set. With victory seemingly in her grasp, she lost her nerve, double-faulted, and allowed Graf to climb back into the match. Graf took the next five games and the title. During the prize presentation ceremony, a distraught Novotn\u00e1 burst into tears and cried on the Duchess of Kent's's shoulder. The Duchess comforted her. Novotn\u00e1 achieved a year-end ranking of No. 6. Novotn\u00e1 hitting a slice backhand ===1994=== She began the 1994 season by reaching the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. In her quarterfinal match, she played Gabriela Sabatini, in what turned out to be their last head-to-head encounter. In their previous meeting, on the grasscourts at the 1993 Wimbledon Championships, Novotn\u00e1 beat Sabatini in a straight-set quarterfinal victory. This time, on the Australian hardcourts, Sabatini defeated Novotn\u00e1 in straight sets. At the French Open, Novotn\u00e1 was beaten in the first round by Anna Smashnova in straight sets. At Wimbledon, Novotn\u00e1 reached the quarterfinals where she again faced Martina Navratilova in a rematch from the previous year. Novotn\u00e1 lost in three sets. At the season's final Grand Slam, the US Open, the seventh seeded Novotn\u00e1 worked her way to the semifinals where she played top-seeded Steffi Graf. Dating back to the 1992 French Open, Novotn\u00e1 had lost nine consecutive matches against Graf. This trend would continue as Graf defeated Novotn\u00e1 in straight sets. ===1997=== It took four years for Novotn\u00e1 to reach another Wimbledon final. In 1997, she faced top-seeded Martina Hingis, and lost in three sets. But to get back to the final, Novotn\u00e1 had to get past Mary Joe Fernandez in the round of 16. She outlasted Fernandez then defeated Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Now back in the semifinals of Wimbledon, her next opponent would be Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario. She had prevailed against Novotn\u00e1 in seven of their nine previous contests, but the majority of those matches were played on clay and hard-courts, at which S\u00e1nchez Vicario excelled. On grass, Novotn\u00e1 had a decided advantage, as she defeated S\u00e1nchez Vicario in straight sets. In the final against Hingis, she started out fast, taking the opening set 6\u20132. But Hingis found her stroke and won the second set 6\u20133 to even the match at one set apiece. The final set proved to be a mirror image of the second set, as Hingis prevailed 6\u20133, handing Novotn\u00e1 her second loss in a Wimbledon Championship match. However, Novotn\u00e1 won the Tour Championships after a victory in the final over Mary Pierce and finished the year ranked a career-high world No. 2 in singles. In addition to winning the Tour Championships, Novotn\u00e1 captured three more WTA singles titles for the year. ===1998: Wimbledon victory=== Her moment of Wimbledon success finally arrived in 1998. After defeating Venus Williams in a close quarterfinal, Novotn\u00e1 avenged the previous year's loss by ousting Martina Hingis in the semifinal in straight sets. She won the singles title by defeating veteran Nathalie Tauziat in the final in two sets. She became the oldest first-time Grand Slam singles winner in the Open Era at age 29 years and nine months. This record would be eclipsed by Francesca Schiavone in 2010 when she won the French Open at 29 years and eleven months and again by Flavia Pennetta when she won the US Open in 2015 at 33 years and 6 months. Novotn\u00e1 won 12 Grand Slam women's doubles titles (four at Wimbledon, three at the French Open, three at the US Open, and two at the Australian Open) and four mixed-doubles titles (two at the Australian Open, one at Wimbledon, and one at the US Open). Novotn\u00e1 was a member of the Czechoslovakian team that won the Fed Cup in 1988. At the Olympic Games, Novotn\u00e1 was a women's doubles silver medalist in 1988 and 1996 and a singles bronze medalist in 1996. She won titles on all four surfaces and crossed the $10 million mark in career prize money in 1998, the fifth player to reach the milestone. She won more than 500 career singles matches, the 15th woman in the Open Era to accomplish the feat. Novotn\u00e1 was named the 1998 WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year with Martina Hingis, the 1997 International Tennis Federation Doubles Team of the Year with Lindsay Davenport, the 1996 WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year with Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, with Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez in 1991 and in 1989 and 1990 with Helena Sukov\u00e1. ==Later years and death== Novotn\u00e1 retired from the professional tour in 1999. During her 14-year career, she won 104 titles (24 in singles, 76 in women's doubles and 4 in mixed doubles). She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2005. From 2000 to 2002, Novotn\u00e1 was a commentator for Wimbledon for the BBC. From 2006 onward, Novotn\u00e1 played the Ladies' Invitation Doubles tournament at Wimbledon; winning it in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014.2006 Wimbledon Championships In 2010, her partner was Martina Navratilova. Also in 2010, she helped Navratilova through her treatment for breast cancer. She played invitational doubles in the other Grand Slams as well and also did charity events and exhibitions. She continued to coach players, including Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1. Novotn\u00e1 resided in Florida until 2010 when she returned to her native Czech Republic. She bought a large house and property in the village of Omice for about 800,000 dollars near her hometown of Brno, where she lived with her partner, former Polish tennis player Iwona Kuczy\u0144ska. She died of cancer at the age of 49 on 19 November 2017, surrounded by her family and friends. She chose to keep her diagnosis of cancer private, only telling her closest friends and relatives. ==Grand Slam performance timelines== ===Singles=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center;font- size:97% |- | colspan=\"1\" | | colspan=\"8\" | Czechoslovakia | colspan=\"7\" | Czech Republic | colspan=\"1\" | |- !
