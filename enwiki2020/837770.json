    "text": "The entropy of fusion is the increase in entropy when melting a substance. This is almost always positive since the degree of disorder increases in the transition from an organized crystalline solid to the disorganized structure of a liquid; the only known exception is helium. It is denoted as \\Delta S_{\\text{fus}} and normally expressed in J mol\u22121 K\u22121 A natural process such as a phase transition will occur when the associated change in the Gibbs free energy is negative. :\\Delta G_{\\text{fus}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fus}} - T \\times \\Delta S_{\\text{fus}} < 0, where \\Delta H_{\\text{fus}} is the enthalpy or heat of fusion. Since this is a thermodynamic equation, the symbol T refers to the absolute thermodynamic temperature, measured in kelvins (K). Equilibrium occurs when the temperature is equal to the melting point T = T_f so that :\\Delta G_{\\text{fus}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{fus}} - T_f \\times \\Delta S_{\\text{fus}} = 0, and the entropy of fusion is the heat of fusion divided by the melting point. : \\Delta S_{\\text{fus}} = \\frac {\\Delta H_{\\text{fus}}} {T_f} ==Helium== Helium-3 has a negative entropy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-4 also has a very slightly negative entropy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, these substances freeze with the addition of heat. ==See also== *Entropy of vaporization ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Thermodynamic entropy Category:Thermodynamic properties ",
