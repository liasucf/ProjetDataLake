    "text": "Seefeld in Tirol is an old farming village, now a major tourist resort, in Innsbruck-Land District in the Austrian state of Tyrol with a local population of 3,312 (as of 1 January 2013). The village is located about northwest of Innsbruck on a plateau between the Wetterstein mountains and the Karwendel on a historic road from Mittenwald to Innsbruck that has been important since the Middle Ages. It was first mentioned in 1022 and since the 14th century has been a pilgrimage site, benefiting not only from the visit of numerous pilgrims but also from its stacking rights as a trading station between Augsburg and the Venice. Also since the 14th century, Tyrolean shale oil has been extracted in the area. Seefeld was a popular holiday resort even before 1900 and, since the 1930s, has been a well known winter sports centres and amongst the most popular tourist resorts in Austria. The municipality, which has been the venue for several Winter Olympics Games, is the home village of Anton Seelos, the inventor of the parallel turn. With more than one million overnight stays each year, it is one of the most popular Tyrolean tourist destinations especially for skiing in winter, but also for walking holidays in the summer. ==Geography== === Neighbouring communities === To the northwest Seefeld borders on Leutasch (village of Weidach), to the northeast on Scharnitz (village of Gie\u00dfenbach). Its eastern municipal boundary with Zirl runs along the ar\u00eate from the Seefelder Joch and Seefelder Spitze. To the south lies Reith (village of Auland) and to the west Telfs (village of M\u00f6sern). === Distances === === Topography === The village is situated on the south-facing Seefeld Plateau north of the River Inn on the watershed between the basins of the Inn and the Isar. The plateau (which also comprises the villages of Leutasch, Reith, Scharnitz and M\u00f6sern) is surrounded by the Wetterstein mountain range to the west, and the Karwendel mountain range to the east; it falls away in a steep drop off to the Inn valley to the south. To the north, the high valley leads through the village of Scharnitz towards the border with Germany at Mittenwald. The Seefeld Plateau as seen from east- south-east with Seefeld in the foreground. Seefeld has two main mountain areas (for walking or skiing): one is the rounded hill, the Gschwandtkopf (1,495 m); the other is on the slopes of the mountains to the east and called the Rossh\u00fctte after the large mountain restaurant halfway up. These mountains dominate the Seefeld Plateau; from left/north to right/south, they are the Seefelder Joch, Seefelder Spitze (2,215 m), H\u00e4rmelekopf (2,224 m) and Reither Spitze (2,374 m). Notable other landmarks include the Seekirchl, a small, onion-domed church, and the Pfarrh\u00fcgel, a spur of the Gschwandtkopf running into the town centre and forming a small attractive hill. There is also a popular bathing lake called the Wildsee. === Lakes and streams === The lake that gave Seefeld its name: the Wildsee. Behind: the Kalkk\u00f6gel On the east side of the Seefelder Joch rise the tributaries of the Haglbach, which flows west through the valley of Hermannstal, then swings south on reaching the plateau to run along the municipal boundary and feed the Wildsee. The Wildsee is threatened by sediment deposition from the Haglbach. In future it is planned to excavate a reservoir east of Innsbrucker Stra\u00dfe to collect these sediments.Josef Hornsteiner: , plateauzeitung.at dated 4 February 2014. Archived from original on 17 April 2014. The tailstream of the Wildsee, now called the Seebach, runs through Seefeld in a northerly direction and collects the waters of the Raabach shortly after passing the village centre. This section was called the M\u00fchlbach by Peter Anich in 1762. The Raabach has its source in the southeast near the M\u00f6sern M\u00e4hder and was once impounded to form a reservoir that gave the church of Seekirchl its name. Below the Schlossberg, near the Seebach, is a radon-containing spring,Heilquelle T20956563R3/QU70351005, Teilauszug aus dem Wasserbuch Tirol. that, under the name of the Franz Josef Spring,Kurzgutachten - ehemaliges Hotel Schneeweiss , Bezirksgericht Innsbruck, 811 20 E 84/12k.

(PDF, 228 KB) Its radon content of 117 becquerels per litre is rather low (the limit for drinking water is 1,000 Bq/l). The Klammbach originates at the Wildmoosalm below the lake of Wildmoossee and runs northwest of the village on the far side of the Geigenb\u00fchel, passes the Triendls\u00e4ge (where there is a reservoir with a capacity of 450 m\u00b3 which supplies a small hydropower station generating 45 kWSpeicherteich Beck.Nr.1) T20542888R3, 3/4 Kleinwasserkraftanlage \"Triendls\u00e4ge\" T20542844R3 extracts from the Wasserbuch Tirol.) and merges with the Seebach by the Lehenwald woods in front of the Bodenalm to form the Drahnbach. The latter flows towards Scharnitz and empties into the Isar tributary, the Gie\u00dfenbach. The Kaltwassersee. The reservoir at near the Rossh\u00fctte (called the Kaltwassersee and named after the local area) has a capacity of 66,500 m\u00b3 and receives its water from the public mains. In 2015 it was additionally fed between April and August from the Blauer Schrofen spring below the Seefelder Spitze. The additional water from the Kaltwassersee for snowmaking was raised in 2009 from 100,000 m\u00b3 to 165,000 m\u00b3 per year.3/3108 Beschneiungsanlage \"Ro\u00dfh\u00fctte - H\u00e4rmelekopf - Reitherjochalm\" T20608870R3, Teilauszug aus dem Wasserbuch Tirol. ===Climate=== ==Population== == Culture and sights == Murals in St. Oswald * Parish and pilgrimage church of St. Oswald * Former Augustine monastery west of the church, today a five- star hotel.

World Cup competitions have been located here a number of times. During the 2019 World Championships, ski jumping took place in Seefeld in Tirol. The 1963 Biathlon World Championships also took place in Seefeld in Tirol. The alpine skiing area is small and appropriate for beginners. There are two separate small areas which are not connected except by a ski bus (free of charge) or taxis. The terrain itself is quite good and there is good access to other facilities (walks, shops and the Olympia swimming complex). Seefeld is popular with walkers because of its plateau location; there are many attractive walks which don't depend on climbing up and down mountains. However, the walks into the mountains are beautiful too, especially since the Karwendel is a huge nature reserve. Recommended walks include down through the Schlossbachklamm to Hochzirl (then the train back), and from the cable car stations down into the Eppzirlertal (if you're fairly fit). There are possibilities for multi-day walks through the Karwendel towards the Achensee.
