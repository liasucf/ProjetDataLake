    "text": "The Armanen-Orden (AO; German for \"Armanen Order\", \"Order of the Armanen\") was founded as a revival of the Ariosophical Guido von List Society by German occultist Adolf Schleipfer (b. 1947) and his then-wife Sigrun von Schlichting.According to Flowers (1988: 36), Schleipfer renewed the GvLS in 1969. According to Schnurbein (1995: 24), he became its president in 1967. The Armanen-Orden is a neopagan esoteric society and religious order reviving the occult teachings of Guido von List. Its internal structure is organized in nine grades, inspired by Freemasonry. The Order is openly ethnonationalist and racialist, and rejects race-mixing as a modern degeneration. ==History== Schleipfer had discovered some of List's works in an antique bookstore in the mid-1960s, and was inspired to found the runic and Armanist magazine IrminsulIrminsul in the German National Library. in hopes of attracting suitable people for a revived Listian order. He was appointed the new president and continued to publish Irminsul as the \"Voice of the Guido von List Society.\" Schleipfer also attended meetings of a related organisation, the Gode-Orden (Gothi-Order), which propagated a similar mixture of occult v\u00f6lkisch thinking. There he met his wife Sigrun Schleipfer, n\u00e9e Hammerbacher (1940\u20132009),Handbuch Deutscher Rechtsextremismus (1996). daughter of the v\u00f6lkisch writer and former NSDAP district leader, Dr. Hans Wilhelm Hammerbacher.Schnurbein (1995), p. 27ff. In 1976 the Schleipfers founded the Armanen-Orden (Armanen Order) as the reorganised Guido von List Society.Schnurbein (1995), p. 25. Since then, Adolf and Sigrun have served as the Grandmasters of the Order, although they have divorced and Sigrun now refers to herself as \"Sigrun von Schlichting\" or \"Sigrun Freifrau von Schlichting\". They also revived the High Armanen Order (HAO) and brought it to \"an unprecedented level of activity\".Flowers (1988), p. 36. The Armanen-Orden celebrates seasonal festivities in a similar fashion as Odinist groups do and invites interested people to these events. The highlights are three 'Things' at Ostara (Easter), Midsummer and Fall (Wotan's sacrificial death), which are mostly celebrated at castles close to sacred places, such as the Externsteine. The author Stefanie von Schnurbein attended a Fall Thing in 1990 and gives the following report in Religion als Kulturkritik (Religion and Cultural Criticism): In 1977 Sigrun Schleipfer founded the Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung der Burgen (Society for the Conservation of Castles), which proclaims castles to be among the \"last paradises of the romantic era\" in this cold modern age and had as its primary aim the purchase and restoration of a castle for the Order. In 1995, the society finally acquired the castle of Rothenhorn in Szlichtyngowa (Poland), a run-down structure dating back to the 12th century, though most of the complex dates from the 16th century. Over many years, Adolf and Sigrun have republished all of List's works (and many others relating to the Armanen runes) in their original German. Adolf Schleipfer has also contributed an article to The Secret King, a study of Karl Maria Wiligut by Stephen Flowers and Michael Moynihan, in which he points out the differences between Wiligut's beliefs and those which are accepted within Odinism or Armanism.Schleipfer (2007). ==Adolf Schleipfer== Adolf Schleipfer, born 1947 , is a German/Austrian occultist and Armanist who re-established the Guido von List Society and Armanen-Orden in 1967 and 1976, respectively.Religion als Kulturkritik, 1995.
