Equivalent to the Chinese (Grand Preceptor). == History == Emperor Tenji's favorite son, Prince \u014ctomo, was the first to have been accorded the title of Daij\u014d-daijin during the reign of his father.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 53. The Asuka Kiyomihara Code of 689 marks the initial appearance of the Daij\u014d Daijin in the context of a central administrative body composed of the three ministers: the Daij\u014d-daijin (Chancellor), the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), and the Udaijin (Minister of the Right). These positions were consolidated under the Code of Taih\u014d in 702.Hall, John Whitney et al.. (1993). The Cambridge History of Japan, p. 232. As the Fujiwara clan\u2014which dominated the regency\u2014gained influence, the official government offices diminished in power. By the 10th century, chancellors had no power to speak of unless they were simultaneously regent, or otherwise supported by the Fujiwara. Although the position continued in name until 1885, by the beginning of the 12th century, the office was essentially powerless, and was often vacant for lengthy periods.Dickson, Walter G. et al.. (1898). Substantial administrative power over the government was in other hands. This prominent office was briefly resurrected under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanj\u014d Sanetomi in 1871, before being abolished completely in 1885 in favor of the newly created office of Prime Minister. == Functions == The Chancellor presided over the Great Council of State, and controlled the officers of the state, in particular the Sadaijin and Udaijin, as well as four great councillors and three minor councillors. The ministers in turn controlled other elements of the government. == List of the Chancellors of the Realm == ==See also== * Kugy\u014d * Sessh\u014d and Kampaku * K\u014dky\u016b * Kuge * Imperial Household Agency ==Notes== ==References== * Asai, T.
