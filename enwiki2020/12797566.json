He was a wonderful man and a terrific poet and teacher. I remember hearing him read at a PSA reading. He read last, I was bored and tired, and he blew the doors off the place. He just exuded a poetic gravitas, and I know few poets who read with such grace and class. I'll miss him. |- |style=\"text-align: right;\" |Steve Roberts Liam Rector: 1949 \u2014 2007 A \"cyber-tombeau\" at Silliman's Blog by poet Ron Silliman includes comments, tributes, and links |} Rector, born in Washington, D.C., was the author of volumes of poetry including The Executive Director of the Fallen World (University of Chicago, 2006), American Prodigal (Story Line, 1994), and The Sorrow of Architecture (Dragon Gate, 1984).
