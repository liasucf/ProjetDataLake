    "text": "View of the Hagia Sophia in 2012 The Hagia Sophia () at Nicaea is a Byzantine- era church (now a mosque) in Nicaea (now known as \u0130znik) in Turkey.Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, \"Nicaea\", London, (1854). The church of Hagia Sophia was built by Justinian I in the middle of the city in the 6th century.Hazlitt, Classical Gazetteer, \"Nic\u00e6a\" It was in this building that the Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 to end the first period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. Hagia Sophia of Nicaea (\u0130znik) in 1962 (photo by Paolo Monti) A timber-roofed basilica with a central nave and side aisles, it was built shortly after 1065, but extensively remodelled after its conversion into a mosque. Before the remodelling it had two rows of triple arcades on columns that carried a clerestory wall with five windows.Richard Krautheimer, Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture, 4th edition, 1986, p365. It was converted to a mosque after the fall of the city to the Ottoman Turks in 1337, and functioned as such until it was converted into a museum in 1935. In November 2011 it was again converted into a mosque. ==Gallery== File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8350.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia front File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8061.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia Exterior File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8066.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia Floor at entrance File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8067.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia Interior File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8083.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia Choir area File:Iznik Hagia Sophia Mosque 8100.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia View of interior of secondary dome File:Iznik Hagia Sophia fresco 045.jpg|Iznik Hagia Sophia fresco ==References== Category:Mosques in Turkey Category:Buildings of Justinian I Category:Byzantine church buildings in Turkey Category:Mosques converted from churches by the Ottoman Empire Category:Former churches in Turkey Category:\u0130znik Category:6th-century churches Category:Buildings and structures in Bursa Province ",
