    "text": "The 1952 British Columbia general election was the 23rd general election in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, alongside a plebiscite on daylight saving time and liquor. The election was called on April 10, 1952, and held on June 12, 1952. The new legislature met for the first time on February 3, 1953. It was the first BC general election to use a preferential ballot, a short- lived phenomenon in the province. The presence of multi-member districts, such as Victoria City with 3 MLAs, in conjunction with the alternative voting system called for an innovation where the district's candidates were split into three \"ballots\", each with one candidate from each party.\"1871-1986 Electoral History of BC\", p. 231-2 The government until not long before the election had been a Liberal / Progressive Conservative coalition (the Conservatives had recently changed their name to match that of their federal cousins). After the coalition had collapsed, the Liberals felt threatened by the rising popularity of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. To lock out the CCF, the government adopted the alternative voting system instead of leaving the existing system in place or switching to STV. While they ran candidates separately under their own names, Liberal and Conservative party leaders believed that if Liberal voters picked the local Tory candidate as their second preference and vice versa, one of the candidates of the two parties would have enough votes to be elected in many districts, hopefully ensuring the coalition's retention of power. However, the Liberal and PC leaders had not reckoned on being so unpopular with the province's voters. The combined Liberal and PC vote total was 120,000 fewer votes than in the previous election, while the Social Credit party received almost 200,000 more votes than in 1949. The combined Liberal and Conservative vote totals surpassed 50 percent in only eight seat contests, so even if the party voters had adhered to coalition discipline, the coalition did not have enough votes to be elected in most of the districts. They received only a comparative few votes through vote transfers from CCF and SC candidates, whose supporters aided each other where possible.\"1871-1986 Electoral History of BC\" In districts where CCF candidates were eliminated, back-up preferences were marked overwhelmingly for the British Columbia Social Credit League (BCSCL). Combined with many second-preference votes transferred from eliminated Liberal and Conservative candidates, this gave the Social Credit party five seats in addition to the 14 seats where its candidates had a plurality in the first counts. In the end, the Social Credit party captured 19 seats. The CCF received 18 seats, helped in many cases by transfers from eliminated SC candidates. The coalition was decimated, winning only 10 seats between both parties. Both Premier Byron \"Boss\" Johnson and Tory leader Herbert Anscomb lost their seats. Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. The party had no official leader. Alberta Social Credit Member of Parliament Ernest George Hansell had led the party during the election campaign without contesting a seat himself. The Socreds persuaded Tom Uphill, a Labour member of the Legislature (MLA), to support the party, and so the Socreds were able to form a minority government. (Otherwise, having to provide the Speaker meant that the SC seat total would have been reduced to only the same as the CCF's seat count.) The party's next task was to choose the province's new premier. In a vote of the newly elected caucus, W.A.C. Bennett, a former Conservative MLA who joined the Socreds after losing a bid for the Tory leadership, won a caucus vote and became premier-elect on July 15, 1952. This began what would be 21 years straight \u2013 and 36 of the next 39 years \u2013 of Social Credit rule in British Columbia. This would also be the last election to produce a minority government until 2017. In hopes of getting a stronger mandate, Bennett deliberately lost a confidence vote in 1953. This forced an election in June 1953 in which Social Credit won a majority of the seats. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"5\"|Popular vote |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" |align=\"center\"|1949 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|First count |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|Change |align=\"center\"|Final count |align=\"center\"|% |Ernest George Hansell |align=\"right\"|47 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|19 |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"|209,049 |align=\"right\"|27.20% |align=\"right\"| +25.99% |align=\"right\"|203,932 |align=\"right\"|30.18% |Co-operative Commonwealth Fed. |Harold Winch |align=\"right\"|48 |align=\"right\"|7 |align=\"right\"|18 |align=\"right\"|+157.1% |align=\"right\"|236,562 |align=\"right\"| 30.78% |align=\"right\"| -4.32% |align=\"right\"|231,756 |align=\"right\"|34.3% |Byron Ingemar Johnson |align=\"right\"|48 |align=\"right\" rowspan=2| 391 |align=\"right\"|6 |align=\"right\" rowspan=2| n/a1 |align=\"right\"|180,289 |align=\"right\"| 23.46% |align=\"right\" rowspan=2|n/a1 |align=\"right\"|170,674 |align=\"right\"|25.26% |Progressive Conservative |Herbert Anscomb |align=\"right\"|48 |align=\"right\"|4 |align=\"right\"|129,439 |align=\"right\"| 16.84% |align=\"right\"|65,285 |align=\"right\"|9.66% |Labour |Tom Uphill |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"|1,290 |align=\"right\"| 0.16% |align=\"right\"| -0.05% |align=\"right\"|1,758 |align=\"right\"|0.26% |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|8 |align=\"right\"|* |align=\"right\"|0 |align=\"right\"|* |align=\"right\"|7,176 |align=\"right\"| 0.93% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|1,318 |align=\"right\"|0.2% |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|5 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"|2,514 |align=\"right\"| 0.33% |align=\"right\"| +0.09% |align=\"right\"|931 |align=\"right\"|0.14% | colspan=\"2\"|Independents |align=\"right\"|5 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| -100% |align=\"right\"|1,312 |align=\"right\"| 0.17% |align=\"right\"|-0.57% |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"| - |Labour Representation Committee |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|* |align=\"right\"|0 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|654 |align=\"right\"| 0.09% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|0 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|276 |align=\"right\"| 0.04% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"| - |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|212 !align=\"right\"|48 !align=\"right\"|48 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|768,561 !align=\"right\"|100% !align=\"right\"| - !align=\"right\"|675,654 !align=\"right\"|100% |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"12\"|Source: Elections BC |- |} Note: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 In the previous election, the Liberal and Conservative parties ran candidates jointly as \"Coalition\" candidates, electing 39 MLAs.
