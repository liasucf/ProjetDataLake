    "text": "The Inflanty Voivodeship (), or Livonian Voivodeship, also known as Polish Livonia, was an administrative division and local government in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, since it was formed in the 1620s out of the Wenden Voivodeship and lasted until the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The Inflanty Voivodeship was one of the few territories of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to be ruled jointly by Poland and Lithuania. ==Overview== The Inflanty Voivodeship, also called the Duchy of Inflanty, due to a 1667 bill of the Sejm, was the minority remainder of the Duchy of Livonia, which had been conquered by the Swedish Empire during the Polish\u2013Swedish War of 1621\u20131625. The seat of the voivode was Dyneburg (Daugavpils). The name Inflanty is derived through Polonization of Livland, the German name for Livonia. In modern times the region is known as Latgalia in the Republic of Latvia.Culture and Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor; p. 14 Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Inflanty Voivodeship: ==Voivodes== This is a list of the voivodes for Inflanty: # Jerzy Farensbach # Maciej Dembl\u0144ski # Krzysztof S\u0142uszka # Teodor Doenhoff # Joachim Tarnowski # Tomasz Sapieha # Pawe\u0142 Sapieha # Miko\u0142aj Korft # Przec\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski # Alexander Morszlyn # Jan Teodor # Jerzy P\u0142atem # Otto Fryderyk Felkierzamb # Jan Koss # J\u0119drzej G\u0142\u0119bocki # Piotr Przebendowski # Antozi Morsztyn # Wilhelm P\u0142atem # Jan Borch # Stanis\u0142aw Brzostowski # Jozafat (Jan) Zyberg # Gaspar Rogali\u0144ski # Adam Falkierzamb ==References== Category:Voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Organisations based in Livonia Category:1621 establishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1772 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ",
