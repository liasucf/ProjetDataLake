Year | 1960 | 1965 | 1969 | 1974 | 1980 | 1996 | 2010 |- ! Population | 51 | 52 | 100 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Less than 100 |} Due to their small population, they have been declared extinct several times by the government by simply absorbing them into other neighbouring Orang Asli groups such as the Jakun people in 1974, 1980 and 1996, and with the Semelai people in 2010 for census and administrative purposes. ==Origins== There are two versions on the origins of the Temoq people:- * The Jakun narrative identifies the Temoq people were once part of the Jakun people. * The Semelai narrative are slightly different from the Jakun's version, but the Semelai people (who practices circumcision) uses the Semaq Beri people and Temoq people as an alternative reference to Orang Asli unlike the Jakun people who do not. The Semelai people regard the Temoq people as the original inhabitants of Tasik Bera. ==Language== The language of the Temoq and Semelai people are of the Austroasiatic languages branch, which is different from the Malayic languages of the Austronesian languages branch. Generally Malay language is frequently used along with Semelai language among the western Temoq people, while Jakun language with the eastern Temoq people although they still know Temoq language. ==Lifestyle== The Temoq people practice ownership of properties at the individual level. Their main sources of income include agriculture, fishing and hunting. == References == Category:Indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia Category:Ethnic groups in Malaysia Category:Orang Asli ",
