Artuir was probably a war leader fighting Picts at the northern and eastern borders of the kingdom. He and his brother Eochaid Find were killed at the battle of MiathiAdomnan of Iona: Life of St. Columba. Book I. chap. VIII. around 580-596 AD. Artuir Mac Aedan is considered a candidate for the historical Arthur.Chadwick, Nora. 1953. \"The Lost Literature of Celtic Scotland: Caw of Pritdin and Arthur of Britain.\" Scottish Gaelic Studies 7:115\u2013183.Carroll, D. F. 1999. The Irrefutable Historical Evidence of the Existence of Arthur. The argument for his candidature rises from his name's root (\"Art\"), his role as war leader and his emergence as the first verifiable \"Art\" in time and space after the Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae Arthurian citations. == History == Artuir is mentioned in three medieval sources: in Adomnan's Life of St. Columba,Book I, chap. IX written c. 700; in the genealogical section of The History of the Men of Scotland,Senchus Fer n-Alban. The History of the Men of Scotland. originally compiled in the seventh century; and his death is also mentioned in the Annals of Tigernach, which date from around 1088. His name, Artuir, derived from Arthur, is Brittonic, probably related to a Welsh mother. Maithgemma nic, daughter of Aedan, was said to be the niece of a Brittonic king. Aedan also had two grandsons and a great-grandson with Brittonic names,Bannerman, John. 1974. Studies in the History of Dalriada. Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press. and it is likely that Artuir was the son of Aedan's Brittonic wife and a brother of Maithgemma. The Life of St. Columba mentions Artuir in a chapter between Aedan and Columba, where the saint predicts that Aedan's younger son, Eochaid Buide, will succeed instead of Aedan's chosen sons. Columba then predicts the deaths of Artuir, Eochaid Find, and Domangart while fighting their father's battles. Adomnan adds \" Artuir and Echoid Find were slain a little while later, in the battle of Miathi mentioned above. Domangart was killed in a rout of battle in England\", illustrating the fulfillment of Columba's prophecy. In the previous chapter, Adomnan portrayed Columba praying for Aedan's victory over the Miathi, indicating that the battle occurred before Columba's death in 596\u20137. == Artuir mac Aedan as King Arthur == Also, Artuir died at the battle of Miathi as a prince, not a king. This is congruent with three major sourcesHistoria Brittonum, The Annales Cambriae and Y Gododdin. about Arthur, where he was no king either, but a \"dux bellorum\". Consistent with Artuir mac \u00c1ed\u00e1n possibly being the historical Arthur, Arthur's death at CamlanThe Annales Cambriae. could be also situated in Scottish territories. The Battle of Miathi could be near their citadel at Dumyat Hill (\"the fortress of the Miathi\") that overlooks the river Allan. A bend in the river Allan would be rendered in Gaelic something like \"Cam Allan\", similarly to the tradition. It is possible that Artuir did contribute one place-name and perhaps the four battles on the River Dubglas in Linnuis, as recorded by the Historia Brittonum.Historia Brittonum, chap. 56 or 50 (Giles Compilation) On the Dalriada\u2013Strathclyde border, W. F. Skene located a hill named Ben Arthur near Loch Long, not far from Glen Douglas in Lennox. Leslie AlcockAlcock, L. 1989. p. 64\u201366 suggested this area as a possible location of the battles on the River Dubglas. Arthurian place-names were once common in Strathclyde, probably related to Artuir.Glennie 1994: 83\u201393, 130 == References == == External links == * Adamnan: Life of St. Columba . * Senchus Fer n-Alban.
