The college specializes in diploma, associate and bachelor's degree programs in healthcare, business, trades, law enforcement, counseling, and other high- demand careers. == History == Beal College was first established as the Bangor Business School by Mary E. Beal and several partners on October 23rd, 1891. In the first year of operation, the Bangor Business School was attended by less than 25 students, and housed on the second floor of the YMCA. Early offerings of the college consisted of courses in banking, accounting, finance, business arithmetic, business writing, commercial law, penmanship, shorthand, and typing. Less than 6 months later, in January of 1892, attendance had quickly grown to over 100 students and more space was required. It was at this point that the shorthand and typing departments moved to a secondary location on the Exchange Street Block. 12 years after the movement of the shorthand and typing departments, Mary E. Beal took ownership of the Shorthand Department of the Bangor Business School. It became Miss Beal's School of Shorthand and Typing, consisting of about 30 students. Some time later, on July 14th, 1922, the school was sold to Francis G. Lee, who changed the name to the Beal College of Business. The next 20 years held much growth for Beal College. In 1928 it was quoted by Harris B. Coe as being, \"not only the largest of its kind in Bangor, but also one of the largest in the State,\". After multiple administrations the name of the school was changed again, to Beal Business College. By its 50th anniversary, Beal Business College offered multiple two-year degree programs, including subjects such as business, administration, secretarial studies, and bookkeeping. Authorized by the legislature of the State of Maine, Beal College began offering an Associate degree in Science on April 28th, 1968. Two years later, in 1970, Beal College was accredited as a junior college of business by the Accreditation Commission for Business Schools in Washington, D.C. In 2016, Beal College celebrated the school's 125th anniversary. Today, Beal College is situated near downtown Bangor, and is offering multiple degrees in a variety of fields. ==Academics== Beal College utilizes a scheduling system referred to as a \"Mod System\".
