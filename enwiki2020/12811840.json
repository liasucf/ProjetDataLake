    "text": "Typically researched in infants, intermodal mapping refers to the ability to gather information about a particular stimulus by integrating multiple senses. Researched by American psychologists Andrew N. Meltzoff and M. Keith Moore, this capability plays an underlying part in neonatal imitation (infant capacity to model observable adult behavior). == Origin == Modern investigation into the field of neonatal imitation and intermodal modeling began with Meltzoff and Moore\u2019s seminal study in 1977, investigating 12 to 21-day-old infants and their ability to replicate adults\u2019 facial and manual gestures. They acknowledge opposing voices who argues replication of observed behaviors is \u201cmerely arousal of oral activity,\u201d with the evidence of imitation of three facial gestures and one manual gesture. The history of the intermodal model began when Meltzoff and Moore defined it as an innate human ability, essential to imitation. They hypothesized intermodal mapping acted as a sequence in which an infant observes an adult\u2019s facial acts and creates a \u201csupramodal\u201d framework. With proprioceptive feedback, an infant can then distinguish whether their actions are equivalent to those they see. Therefore, stimuli are not necessarily restricted to a singular sense, but allow them to exist universally in the brain and integrate in ways to produce complex outcomes. This is illustrated specifically in how visual and proprioceptive systems (senses) integrate to aid imitation. Meltzoff and Moore\u2019s studies typically mirror the Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP) as they observe both behavior in relation to response time in infants. == Criticism == Criticisms of this approach typically question the innate, or inborn, claims Meltzoff and Moore make. Overall, researchers doubt the possibility that infants have the inherent ability to observe and create their own sequence of movements producing the same \u201cconfigurations\u201d or actions of the adults they\u2019re modeling. In addition, critics question how the link between visual input and motor faculties can be made so early in the infant\u2019s development. == Neurological Explanation == Meltzoff and Moore describe a neurological explanation claiming mirror neurons as the true mechanism linking \u201csensory input from observed actions to motor programs.\u201d Found in the adult rhesus monkey cortex, similar areas in the human cortex are thought to also contain these neurons, although evidence is still debated. Theoretically, both the intermodal mapping model and mirror neurons function through automatic low-level processes meant to facilitate imitation. With Hebbian Theory in mind, mirror neurons cannot be innate. They could, however, gain responsiveness through \u201cpostnatal experience,\u201d which Meltzoff acknowledges as a part of the intermodal model\u2019s nature as an imitation mechanism. == Replication == Several French institutions have involved themselves in this hypothesis and tested its relation to infants, specifically the Centre des Sciences du Go\u00fbt et de l'Alimentation, Dijon, France; the Centre Emotion, H\u00f4pital de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France, and the Unit\u00e9 de Psychiatrie P\u00e9rinatale, Maternit\u00e9 Ambroise Par\u00e9, Bourg-La-Reine, France. In the Soussignan, et. al. 2011 study \u201cHuman newborns match tongue protrusion of disembodied human and robotic mouths\u201d, researchers replicate the Meltzoff and Moore position with 2D stimuli. As a result, this research reinforces the intermodal mapping hypothesis, adding that repeated experience and associative sequence learning are crucial components to this hypothesis. However, other studies have failed to replicate Meltzoff and Moore\u2019s findings. Maurer, Stager, and Mondlock\u2019s study \u201cCross- modal transfer of shape is difficult to demonstrate in 1-month-olds\u201d (1999) first criticized Meltzoff for \u201clacking important controls.\u201d Yet, after those were included, Maurer et al. (1999) failed to replicate Meltzoff\u2019s findings. ==References== Category:Perception ",
