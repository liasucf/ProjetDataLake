    "text": "Thee Headcoats was a band formed in Chatham, Kent, England in 1989, that was well known for its garage rock sound, explicitly sticking to this style on almost all of their albums. The band's signature sound as well as their prolific writing has been attributed to Billy Childish's love of simple, direct recording. The band has been on multiple labels including Billy's own Hangman Records, Damaged Goods and Sub Pop. The band played their final concert on 12 May 2000 at the Dirty Water Club. Childish went on to play with other bands including The Buff Medways (1999 to 2006) and The Musicians of The British Empire (2007 to 2011). == Lineup == The band was composed of Billy Childish (guitar and vocals), Bruce Brand (drums and backing vocals), and Johnny Johnson (bass). The band is the most prolific of Childish's many musical projects so far, releasing fourteen full-length albums. The group originally featured Allan Crockford (ex-The Prisoners) (credited as Krojack on the first LP, Headcoats Down), followed by John Agnew (ex-Thee Mighty Caesars) then Ollie Dolat (co-founder of The Squares and founder of Mr Zero) on bass before Johnson joined. Thee Headcoatees, an all-female vocal group consisting of Holly Golightly, Kyra LaRubia, Ludella Black, and (until leaving in 1999) Bongo Debbie, would often perform live with Thee Headcoats, and recorded several LPs with them as backing band. The band also recorded two albums as Thee Headcoats Sect, with members of The Downliners Sect. ==Repertoire and influence== Described in the New York Times as 'the king of garage rock', Thee Headcoats had their roots in the British punk scene of the 1970s (both Billy and Bruce playing in The Pop Rivets and The Milkshakes). The band recorded songs by The Clash under the pseudonym Thee Stash. The band also recorded tribute albums to Bo Diddley and Jimmy Reed. Their debut album featured new versions of songs recorded by Son House including \"John the Revelator\" and \"Child's Death Letter\", both of which were later covered by The White Stripes upon whom Billy and Thee Headcoats were a great influence. These influences give a good indication of the band's sound; punk mixed with pure rhythmic rock 'n' roll and blues. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Headcoats Down!
