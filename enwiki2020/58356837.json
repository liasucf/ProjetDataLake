Bin Ghabaisha was 17 years old when he first crossed the Rub' al Khali desert and became one of the closest companions to Thesiger.\u0639\u0637\u0627\u060c\u0647\u0648\u064a\u062f\u0627: \u00ab\u0639\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0644\u064a \u00bb (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0642\u0648 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0628\u0646 \u0644\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0646) \u0627\u0635\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u064a\u062f\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u060c\u0623\u0628\u0648\u0638\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 His photographs, taken by Sir Wilfred, have been displayed in Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford after Thesiger donated his vast collection of 38,000 negatives to the museum. Thesiger described Salim bin Ghabaisha in Arabian Sands as one of the most competent of his companions: 'the others tended to rely on his judgment, as I did myself. He was certainly the best rider and the best shot, and always graceful in everything he did. He had a quick smile and a gentle manner, but I already suspected that he could be both reckless and ruthless, and I was not surprised when within two years he had become one of the most daring outlaws on the Trucial Coast with half a dozen blood-feuds on his hands' (1960: 208\u20139). Bin Ghabaisha became one of the icons of the pre-oil era in the United Arab Emirates and was subjected to various interviews and Emirati documentaries in his late years to depict his experience as a traveler. He died on 2 January 2016 in Abu Dhabi.\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u062f\u062f 3716 ==See also== * Wilfred Thesiger * Arabian Sands ==References== ==Further reading== * Michael Asher, Thesiger- A Biography Penguin 1994 Category:1930 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Bedouins in Asia ",
