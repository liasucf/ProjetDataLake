    "text": "Norman Findlay Buchan (27 October 1922 \u2013 23 October 1990) was a Labour Party politician, who was on the left-wing of the party, and represented the West Renfrewshire seat from 1964 until 1983 and the Paisley South seat from 1983 until his death in 1990. ==Early life== A schoolteacher based in Rutherglen, he was interested in folk music, compiling a book entitled 101 Scottish Songs,Buchan, Norman. 101 Scottish Songs (Glasgow; London: Collins, 1962). often referred to as The Wee Red Book. ==Political career== At the 1964 Rutherglen by-election, he only lost the Labour selection meeting fairly narrowly to Gregor Mackenzie, and he went on to take West Renfrewshire from the Conservatives at the general election later that year. Whilst a Member of Parliament, he served as Joint Under Secretary of State for Scotland from 1966 to 1970, and as Minister of State for Agriculture from 1974 to 1979. He later became Shadow Minister for the Arts in opposition. Buchan opposed an early day motion to block the televised version of Tony Harrison's poem \"V\" on Channel 4, saying that members who opposed the broadcast had either not read or understood the poem. Buchan was also influential in changing the voting system for the referendum on Scottish Home Rule in the late-1970s. He abstained during Labour's 1981 deputy leadership election, commenting: \"My brain turned against Benn, but my stomach turned against Healey.\" He died in 1990 (coincidentally, the neighbouring MP for Paisley North, Allen Adams also died that year, resulting in by-elections being held in the same month for the two seats). He was succeeded as MP for Paisley South by Gordon McMaster of the Labour Party. ==Family== He was married for 44 years (1946\u20131990) to Janey Buchan (n\u00e9e Kent), Labour Member of the European Parliament for Glasgow from 1979 to 1994. She died in Brighton on 14 January 2012. His only son, Alasdair Buchan, has been a journalist since 1968. == References == == External links == * *The Norman & Janey Buchan Collection at Glasgow Caledonian University Category:1922 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Rutherglen Category:Scottish schoolteachers Category:20th-century Scottish writers Category:Scottish folk-song collectors Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Paisley constituencies Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:People who died in office Category:20th-century musicologists Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964\u20131970 ",
