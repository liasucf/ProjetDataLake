    "text": "Domestique () is a 2018 Czech sport drama directed by Adam Sedl\u00e1k. It premiered at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on 1 July 2018. ==Plot== The film is about Roman and his wife \u0160arlota. Roman is a professional biker obsessed with winning. He tries to get in shape after an injury. His wife \u0160arlota tries to get pregnant but Roman's obsession leads to deterioration of their relationship. ==Cast== * Ji\u0159\u00ed Konvalinka as Roman * Tereza Hofov\u00e1 as \u0160arlota * Miroslav Hanu\u0161 as Doctor * Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bambusek as Kustod ==Review== Hossein Eidizadeh wrote for that \"Virtually the entire film happens in Roman\u2019s apartment. For most of the film, we see him cycling madly on an exercise bike; we see the expansion and contraction of his muscles, as if we are following the routines of a laboratory rat under examination. You get so close to Roman and his obsession that, by the end of the film, you are out of breath, as if having cycled for two hours. Sedl\u00e1k\u2019s first film is visually compelling; he creates an ominous atmosphere in which the only sound heard is Roman\u2019s breathing, his cycle, and the oxygen machine. \u0160arlota (Tereza Hofov\u00e1), Roman\u2019s wife, longs for a baby and the presence of the oxygen tent adds another level to this already horrifying story of alienation and makes way for the hard-to- forget ending of this domestic thriller.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:Czech sports films Category:Czech drama films Category:Czech films Category:Czech-language films Category:Czech Lion Awards winners (films) Category:Golden Kingfisher winners ",
