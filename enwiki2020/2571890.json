He may be best known as one of the founders of the city of Orange, California. ==Early life == Glassell was born as Andrew Glassell in Orange County, Virginia. Glassell's parents were Andrew Glassell (1793\u20131873) and Susanna Thornton (1804\u20131836). In 1834 his family moved to Greensboro, Alabama, where his father engaged in cotton planting.

During the Civil War his sympathies were with the South, and he refused to take the loyalty oath to the United States required of lawyers. He left his public office and quit the practice of law and operated a lumber mill near Santa Cruz. Glassell wouldn't sign oath of loyalty ==Los Angeles legal practice== After the war GlassellPortrait of Andrew Glassell came to Los Angeles in 1865. He formed a partnership with Alfred Chapman and Colonel George H. Smith, the firm becoming known as Glassell, Chapman & Smith. Their law practice was confined chiefly to real estate transactions and they made their fortunes by being retained in the large partition suits. When Glassell first came to California, he had worked with the federal land commission that reviewed all the old Mexican Rancho grants and so he was very well versed in title land law. Chapman was the businessman of the firm. They would take their compensation in land, and nearly every final decree in partition would find that Glassell and Chapman had quite an area of land in severalty. Glassell was involved in the legal suit known as The Great Partition of 1871 brought against the Rancho San Rafael property in the eastern San Fernando Valley and Verdugo Mountains.Rancho San Rafael The section he and Chapman were awarded later became the community of Glassell Park, Los Angeles.

In 1878, Glassell served as the first president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. == Orange, California == Glassell, Chapman & Smith looked after the interests of the Yorba family of the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, and when after a drought, the final settlement was reached there was not enough cash to satisfy attorney fees. Reluctantly a few thousand acres of land were taken in payment, and Chapman and Glassell came into possession of the land on which the City of Orange, California was built. In 1872, the Richland Farm Tract (later Orange) subdivision was placed on the market by Andrew Glassell. Glassell and Chapman employed the former's younger brother, Captain William T.

He divided the tract into 60 lots surrounding a town site, which he called Richland after his father's plantation's name, and served as sales agent for the property. In 1873, when a post office was sought for the village it was discovered that there was a town in Sacramento County by the name of Richland.
