Bertolucci has had framed and hung around his salon all the letters sent to him by his musical idol the great Signor Fagotto. Caramello arrives to woo her, the lyre of Pindar under his arm. However, Clorinda is in love with her music tutor Fabricio, a young composer whose work is not music to Bertolucci's ears, but whom Clorinda hopes to wed with the help of her maid Moschetta. Fabricio arrives and gives Clorinda her music lesson. Bertolucci's servant Bac\u00f2lo spots an opportunity for him to win the heart and hand of Moschetta, who has spurned him so far, by assisting with a plot to outwit their master and musical snob. This very day Fagotto has consented to be witness at the signing of the marriage contract between Clorinda and Caramelo. Fagotto appears wearing an eccentric costume; he then displays some especially gymnastic skills and his talent in imitative music including animals and fireworks. Fagotto of course is not the real maestro but Bac\u00f2lo in disguise; Bertolucci overwhelmed by his artistry and his admiration knows no bounds. When Caramelo declaims an ode, this is met with scorn by Fagotto, who lauds the music of young Fabricio, whose talent \u2013 as revealed by the great Fagotto \u2013 is now praised in turn by Bertolucci. Having previously treated him with contempt, with Fagotto\u2019s imprimatur Bertolucci would now consent to him marrying his daughter. Caramello is furious and attacks Fagotto, and in the confusion Bac\u00f2lo loses his wig and the scheme is revealed. Bac\u00f2lo admits that he was the author of the letters received by Bertolucci from his idol. The marriage of Clorinda and Fabricio is agreed and Moschetta, impressed by Bac\u00f2lo\u2019s work, agrees she will have him in the end. ==References== Category:Operas by Jacques Offenbach Category:French-language operas Category:Operas Category:One-act operas Category:1863 operas Category:Op\u00e9rettes ",
