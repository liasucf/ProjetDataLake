Dave Gelly for The Guardian summarised \"[t]he arrangements are sharp and witty, the singing deceptively easygoing, and the guitar playing just terrific. It's a delight.\" Rick Anderson commented for AllMusic that \"[w]hat's charming about this album, beyond the sheer quality of the songs and the arrangements, is Pizzarelli's obvious and genuine love for this really broad gamut of material, and his insight into the varied qualities that make them all great songs.\" Will Layman's review for the PopMatters magazine was more mixed, commenting \"[t]he delightful singer and guitarist plays pop/rock material in his jazz style, managing a couple of miracles and few real misses.\" And for the Boston Globe, Steve Greenlee wrote \"[i]f you like Pizzarelli, you\u2019ll enjoy this immensely. If, however, you find his voice too thin and nasally, then \u201cDouble Exposure\u201d won't win you over.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2012 albums Category:John Pizzarelli albums Category:Vocal jazz albums Category:Telarc Records albums ",
