Laurent Wetzel, a CDS politician from Sartrouville, wrote an article in which he explained his refusal to support renaming a local street after Paul. He accused Paul of having cooperated with the internal management at the camp, thereby having determined the fate (the death) of a number of prisoners and he accused Paul of having given greater priority to the interests of his party. The Association Dora-Buchenwald and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des d\u00e9port\u00e9s et intern\u00e9s r\u00e9sistants et patriotes filed a libel suit. The trial was held in Versailles and heard testimony from a number of former concentration camp prisoners. Wetzel was acquitted but the court refused to rule on the historical truth. A similar accusation had been raised against Paul in 1946. == References == Category:1900 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:French Communist Party politicians Category:Members of the Francs-tireurs et partisans Category:Members of the General Confederation of Labour (France) Category:Auschwitz concentration camp survivors Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery ",
