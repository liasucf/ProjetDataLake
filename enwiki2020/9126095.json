    "text": "The Candel\u00e1ria Church (, ) is an important historical Roman Catholic church in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in southeastern Brazil. It was built and decorated during a long period, from 1775 to the late 19th century. The church combines a Portuguese colonial Baroque fa\u00e7ade with later Neoclassical and Neo- Renaissance interior elements. ==History== The quasi-legendary history about the establishment of the church is that in the beginning of the 17th century a ship called Candel\u00e1ria almost sank during a storm on the sea. Upon arriving in Rio de Janeiro, a Portuguese couple, Ant\u00f3nio Martins Palma and Leonor Gon\u00e7alves sponsored the building of a small chapel, fulfilling the oath they made during the storm. This small chapel, dedicated to Our Lady of Candel\u00e1ria, was built around 1609. In the second half of the 18th century, as the ancient chapel was in need of repair, Portuguese military engineer Francisco Jo\u00e3o Roscio was put in charge of the project of a new, larger building. The works started in 1775 and the church - still unfinished - was inaugurated in 1811 in the presence of King John VI of Portugal, who at the time was in Rio with the whole Portuguese court. From this early period (1775-1811) the splendid main fa\u00e7ade was built in Baroque style with neoclassical elements. The interior of the church was, however, greatly modified afterwards, as the floorplan was changed from a one-aisled to a three-aisled nave. Around 1856 the stone roofs of the aisles were completed, but the dome over the crossing was still unfinished. The dome would only be completed in 1877 after the intervention of several architects and much discussion and planning. The dome and its eight statues were made in white Lioz stone, in Lisbon, and brought to Brazil by ship. When finished, the dome of the Candel\u00e1ria was the tallest structure in the city.

The walls and columns were covered with Italian marble of various colours, and abundant sculptural relief decoration. Brazilian painter Jo\u00e3o Zeferino da Costa was commissioned to paint the nave and inner part of the dome. On the ceiling of the main aisle, Zeferino da Costa and his assistants painted six panels telling the history of the church. Other elements of interest include: the main altar by Brazilian architect Archimedes Mem\u00f3ria; the various German stained-glass windows; the bronze doors (c. 1901) of the main entrance, by Portuguese sculptor Ant\u00f3nio Teixeira Lopes; and the two monumental bronze pulpits in the Art-Nouveau style, by Portuguese sculptor Rodolfo Pinto do Couto (1931). ==Architecture== The Candel\u00e1ria church is a Latin cross church with a dome over the transept. The nave has three aisles and a main chapel in the apse. The whole ensemble may have been inspired by the church at the Convent of Mafra, and in the Estrela Bas\u00edlica of Lisbon, both in Portugal. ===Fa\u00e7ade=== The main fa\u00e7ade shows Baroque influences in the design of the windows, doors, and towers, as well as neoclassical influences in the bi-dimensionallity of the fa\u00e7ade and the triangular pediment. The fa\u00e7ade contrasts the dark granite of windows, columns and other elements with whitewashed wall segments, a typical characteristic of colonial churches in Rio. ==Events== The church has been the site of several significant moments in the contemporary history of Brazil, such as the memorial mass of high school student Edson Lu\u00eds de Lima Souto, and the Diretas J\u00e1 campaign for popular direct presidential elections attended by over a million people in 1984. The area around the church was the site of the Candel\u00e1ria massacre of July 23, 1993, which brought worldwide attention to the issue of police brutality toward street children in Brazil. The official cauldron for the 2016 Summer Olympics was placed in a plaza outside the church. ==Gallery== File:Bertichem 1856 Igreja da Candel\u00e1ria.jpg|Candel\u00e1ria Church in 1856.
