    "text": "August Gustav Heinrich von Bongard (12 September 1786 \u2013 1839) was a German botanist who worked in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Born in Bonn, he was among the first botanists to describe the new plants then being discovered in Alaska (under Russian ownership at the time), including species now of major commercial importance like Sitka Spruce and Red Alder. The specimens he described were mostly collected by Carl Mertens at Sitka, Alaska. The plant genus Bongardia (family Berberidaceae) is named in his honor.The A to Z of Plant Names: A Quick Reference Guide to 4000 Garden Plants by Allen J.
