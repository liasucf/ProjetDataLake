He is the Timothy J. Wilmott '80 Endowed Chair Professor and Department Chair of the Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringDepartment of Industrial and Systems Engineering of Lehigh University. == Education == Luis Nunes Vicente was born in Coimbra, Portugal. He obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and Operations Research at the University of Coimbra in 1990. He continued his studies at Rice University, USA, earning a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 1996. His Ph.D. dissertation, titled Trust- Region Interior-Point Algorithms for a Class of Nonlinear Programming Problems, was supervised by John Dennis. == Career == From 1996 to 2018, Luis Nunes Vicente was a faculty member at the Department of MathematicsDepartment of Mathematics of the University of Coimbra, Portugal, becoming full professor in 2009. He held several visiting positions, namely at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and the University of MinnesotaIMA/University of Minnesota in 2002-2003, at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York UniversityCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences/NYU and the Universit\u00e9 Paul Verlaine of Metz in 2009-2010, and at Roma/Sapienza and Rice University in 2016-2017. He was visiting Chercheur S\u00e9nior of the Fondation de Coop\u00e9ration Sciences et Technologies pour l'A\u00e9ronautique et l'Espace at CERFACS and IPN Toulouse, during 2010-2015. He has served on numerous editorial boards, including SIAM Journal on Optimization (2009-2017), EURO Journal on Computational Optimization, and Optimization Methods and Software (2010-2018). He was Editor-in-Chief of Portugaliae Mathematica during 2013-2018. == Book == Luis Nunes Vicente co-authored the book Introduction to Derivative-Free Optimization, MPS-SIAM Series on Optimization, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2009, with Katya Scheinberg and Andrew R. Conn. == Recognition == Luis Nunes Vicente was awarded the Lagrange Prize of SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) and MOS (Mathematical Optimization Society) for the co-authorship of the book Introduction to Derivative-Free Optimization. With his Ph.D. dissertation, he received the Ralph Budd Thesis Award from Rice University in 1996 and was one of the three finalists of the 94-96 A. W. Tucker Prize of MOS. He is also the winner of the Lagrange Award. == References == == External links == * Personal web page at Lehigh University * Personal web page at the University of Coimbra * Publications form Google Scholar * Luis Nunes Vicente at the Mathematics Genealogy Project Category:Living people Category:Portuguese mathematicians Category:American mathematicians Category:Rice University alumni ",
