The station is owned by Bluff City Radio, a company of Mike Huckabee and Paul Coats, and operated by PB Radio under a local marketing agreement; it broadcasts a classic country format known as 98.1 The Hog. ==History== The station received its callsign in February 2015 and launched later that year. Huckabee and Coats had bought the permits for three stations from Nancy Miller and acquired KTRN from another owner. In March 2018, Huckabee and Coats struck a local marketing agreement to have the four Pine Bluff stations he owned be operated by PB Radio, which is owned by Mike and Alpha Horne. PB Radio also has the option of purchasing them. ==References== ==External links== TPB Category:Country radio stations in the United States ",
