Local taxi operators who lost their livelihood due to the conflict organized the \"Seven Karta\" militia around 2017/18, and occupied parts of the region.Cameroon's Anglophone crisis: Red Dragons and Tigers - the rebels fighting for independence, BBC, Oct 4, 2018. Accessed Mar 13, 2019. Government troops raided the Bafut Royal Palace at least twice in 2018 and 2019, both times claiming to search for armed separatists. Though no rebels were found in either raid, the soldiers used the occasions to burn part of the palace, loot its museum, and injured the Fon's brother. == Battle == The operation was launched on April 26, with the official aim of expelling the Seven Karta militia from Bafut. The operation involved more than 300 soldiers, and consisted of a series of raids on separatist camps.
