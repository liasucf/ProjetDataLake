In June 2014, Somaliland president Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud (Ex- president) announced the creation of Somaliland's 14th region, consisting of 4 new districts. The new region, dubbed Haysimo was formed out of the eastern Sool and Sanaag regional districts. It contains the cities of Taleh, Sarmanyo, Godaalo, Hallin, and Aroley. The presidential decree stated that Taleh is the regional capital.http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2008/Mar/somaliland_president_creates_new_regions_and_districts.aspx 8 regions created by President Dahir rayale and Silanyo were not approved by parliament because the new regional boundaries are not clearly demarcated. Currently Somaliland is divided in 6 regions, Awdal, Saahil, Maroodi-Jeeh, Toghdeer, Sanaag and Sool.
