    "text": "Noah S. \"Soggy\" Sweat, Jr. (October 2, 1922February 23, 1996) was a judge, law professor, and state representative in the U.S. state of Mississippi, notable for his 1952 speech on the floor of the Mississippi state legislature concerning whiskey. Reportedly the speech took Sweat two and a half months to write.Clarion Ledger , \"On June 3, Soggy's speech will come to life\" 25 May 2003 The speech is renowned for the grand rhetorical terms in which it seems to come down firmly and decisively on both sides of the question. The speech gave rise to the phrase if-by-whiskey, used to illustrate such equivocation in argument. ==Career== Sweat was elected to the House in 1947, at the age of 24. He served only one term, at the end of which he delivered his speech.The Clarion Ledger, Saturday, February 24, 1996, Jackson, MS, p. 3 col B He subsequently pursued his career in law. Judge Sweat was the founder of the Mississippi Judicial College of the University of Mississippi Law Center.Mississippi Judicial College Web Page The writer John Grisham worked as his assistant as a law student in 1980. According to William Safire, Sweat's nickname was derived from the phrase \"sorghum top\", a reference to the way in which his hair resembled a sugar cane tassel. He died in 1996 in Alcorn County, Mississippi after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. ==The \"whiskey speech\"== The \"whiskey speech\" concerned the question of the prohibition of alcoholic liquor, a law that was still in force in Mississippi at the time the speech was delivered. Sweat later recalled, \"When I finished the first half of the speech, there was a tremendous burst of applause. The second half of the speech, after the close of which, the wets all applauded. The drys were as unhappy with the second part of the speech as the wets were with the first half\". ==References== ==External links== *Safire, William (1997) Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History.
