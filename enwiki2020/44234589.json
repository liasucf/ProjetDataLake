    "text": "Chetna Natya Manch (CNM; English: Awakening and Dramatic Arts Front) is the \"Cultural Troupe\" of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Chetna Natya Manch is headed by Leng (who is from Andhra Pradesh), and has more than 10,000 members. ==Background and activities== The CNM is the \"propaganda unit\" and \"cultural wing\" of the Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist) People's War (PWG), and \"conducted dance, drama, poetry and musical workshops\" in the villages, \"inspiring young people to join the PWG.\" According to them, they are a \"cultural team\", and they \"don't fight\" but only \"sing\". They also focus on literature and plastic arts. They have raised their music cassettes by themselves and also have a \"mobile editing unit.\" The CNM attracts \"huge crowds\" to their presentations. ==Publication== The CNM, in August 1994, began publishing a bimonthly magazine named \"Jhankar\" in Bengali, Gondi, Hindi, Marathi and Telugu. It is still published. ==Opposition== The government of India's ministry of Information and Broadcasting has \"activated its own cultural wing\" to \"counter\" the CNM, which they believe is \"instigating the tribals against the Indian state through songs and cultural programmes.\" The CNM was banned by the government of Chhattisgarh on 16 August 2013 under the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act for its alleged participation in the \"insurgency activities\" in the Red corridor region of Chhattisgarh, and recently, the ban has been extended till 30 August 2015. ==References== ==See also== * Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan * Nari Mukti Sangh Category:Communist Party of India (Maoist) Category:Maoist organisations in India Category:Volunteer organisations in India ",
