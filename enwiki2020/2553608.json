    "text": "Sunnyside is a 1919 American short silent film written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin. It was his third film for First National Pictures. ==Plot summary == Charlie works on a farm from 4 a.m. to late at night at the run- down Evergreen Hotel in the rural village of Sunnyside. He has endless duties inside the hotel as well as farm chores. Chaplin's boss is the local preacher who mistreats him badly. He gets his food and the boss' on the run (milking a cow into his coffee, holding a chicken over the frying pan to get fried eggs). Charlie's love interest in the village is the girl played by Edna Purviance. He loves her, but is disliked by her father. One day, while leading some cattle, a steer escapes into the church. Charlie tries to ride it out of harm's way, but instead is tossed off a small bridge. Unconscious, he dreams of an encounter with four beautiful nymphs who dance with him. Back in reality a city slicker is hurt in a car crash and is being cared for by Edna. He appears to have an eye for Edna too. Chaplin tries to win her back by dressing as the city man does\u2014but his homemade spats only prompt ridicule. When Charlie is rejected after attempting to imitate the slicker, he appears to be preparing to commit suicide. However, the result is ambiguous with the film either having a tragic or a happy ending. Critics have long argued as to whether the final scene is real or a dream. ==Deleted Scene== The 1983 documentary Unknown Chaplin contains a deleted scene in which Charlie also serves as the hotel's hapless barber. Albert Austin plays a man who has come in for a shave and gets more than he expected from the Evergreen Hotel's inept barber. ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin - Farm handyman * Edna Purviance - Village Belle * Tom Wilson - Boss * Henry Bergman - Villager and Edna's Father * Olive Ann Alcorn - Nymph * Tom Wood - Fat Boy * Loyal Underwood - Fat Boy's Father * Tammie Harding Barlow - Dancer #3 * Helen McDonough - Dancer * Albert Austin - Village Doctor ==Reception== The June 16, 1919 issue of The New York Times contains this review: The nymph dance in the dream sequence has been recognized as being a tribute to or parody of the ballet L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune by Vaslav Nijinsky. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1919 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:1919 comedy films Category:1919 short films Category:Comedy short films Category:First National Pictures films ",
