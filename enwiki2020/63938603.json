    "text": "Marguerite Boucicaut Marguerite Boucicaut, n\u00e9e Gu\u00e9rin (born January 3, 1816 in Verjux, France, died December 8, 1887, Cannes) was a French businesswoman and benefactor. She participated in the creation and prosperity of the first department store, Au Bon March\u00e9, in Paris alongside her husband Aristide Boucicaut. She became a philanthropist later in life. == Early life == Marguerite was raised by a single mother after her birth in Verjux, in Sa\u00f4ne et Loire. Her mother dies when Marguerite is 13, and Marguerite begins working in Paris at a laundress. She builds up her savings and begins to run a \"broth\" that caters to local workers, where she meets her future husband Aristide. Marguerite and Aristide began their relationship in 1836. In 1839, she had a son, but he died as an infant. == The Bon March\u00e9 == In 1852, Aristide borrowed money to become the co-proprietor of the Bon March\u00e9, before buying out his business partner in 1863. Upon Aristide's death in 1877, Marguerite continued to run the store, even expanding it. The Boucicaut's treatment of their employees was novel for the time - a paternalistic relationship where the employees were given food, housing, entertainment, and education. In return, loyalty and adherence to a moral code (ironic given that the Boucicaut's relationship might have involved cohabitation before marriage). In 1880, Marguerite changed the company to a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en commandite, or a partnership with her top managers that continued the \"family\" nature of the Bon March\u00e9 even after her death. With no heirs, Marguerite willed her fortune to the employes of the Bon Marche and her social works, including a hospital and a home for unwed mothers. == References == Category:1816 births Category:1887 deaths Category:19th-century French businesspeople Category:19th-century French women Category:People from Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire ",
