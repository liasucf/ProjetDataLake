The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accredits the school. The United States captured the Paulau islands from Japan in 1944, and the Department of the United States Navy setup the school system in 1946. , it operated elementary schools on a number of islands for grades 1\u20136, and opened Palau Intermediate School, in a building left by the Japanese, for the grades 7\u20139, offering a curriculum of Vocational Education Programs. Palau had passed formally to the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Trustees extended the education system to add grades 10\u201312 in 1962; the elementary schools took on grades 1\u20139 and the Intermediate School building was converted into Palau High School, offering a mix of academic and vocational curricula for the older students. A new building was completed sometime between the late 1960s and the middle of the 1970s, a period when several other public structures were built by the U.S. Trustees across the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. When Paulu entered the Compact of Free Association in 1982, it took on more responsibility for its own education system, taking full control when it achieved independence in 1994. ==References== ==External links== * Palau High School Category:Education in Palau Category:Educational organizations based in Palau Palau Category:Buildings and structures in Koror Category:High schools Category:1962 establishments in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands Category:Educational institutions established in 1962 ",
