Over the years this has included The Cure\u2019s Reflections (2011); Kraftwerk\u2019s retrospective, The Catalogue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 in 3D (2013); Brian Eno\u2019s Pure Scenius (2009); Lou Reed & Laurie Anderson (2010) and the Pixies (2014).

Vivid LIVE was the winner of the Helpmann Award for Best Contemporary Music Festival in 2015. In 2018 the festival will celebrate its tenth anniversary. == History == In its inaugural incarnation, Luminous, the festival was curated by Brian Eno whose aim was to produce a truly eclectic lineup: \"people who work in the new territories, the places in between, the places out at the edges.\" Acts included New York city's experimental rock group Battles, trumpet player and composer Jon Hassell, and comedian/musician Reggie Watts. In 2010, the late Lou Reed and his wife Laurie Anderson realised their artistic vision by performing works of their own, with Reed's Metal Machine Trio and Anderson's Transitory Life. 2011 saw the Sydney-based music promoter and founder of Modular Recordings Steve Pavlovic program the likes of The Cure, video artist Chris Cunningham and psychedelic rock project Tame Impala. The Studio venue was also transformed into a club space for the first time with parties curated by The Avalanches, Mad Racket featuring Gavin Russom\u2019s The Crystal Ark and 2manydjs. In 2012, Sydney Opera House took the programming of the festival into its own hands, reflecting the rising status of contemporary music at the performing arts centre. Fergus Lineham, the Head of Contemporary Music at the time, said the change was necessary to facilitate the ambitious nature of the festival: \"there was such a time commitment and a geographical challenge that it meant we ended up with a lot of people who would have loved to do something but wouldn't do the whole thing.\" The lineup included Sufjan Stevens, Florence + the Machine and the Ceremonial Orchestra, and the Australian premiere of Shut Up and Play the Hits\u2014a documentary recounting the lead up to LCD Soundsystem's final performance. Karen O also appeared in the Australian debut of her \"psycho-opera\" Stop the Virgens. In 2015, Ben Marshall, Head of Contemporary Music at Sydney Opera House, presented his first Vivid LIVE line up \u2014 one that he described as \"a celebration of unique individuals' voices\". In a first for contemporary music at the Opera House, Sydney label Future Classic presented concerts on the Northern Broadwalk. == Artist lineups by year == === 2009 === Curated by Brian Eno * Battles * Ladytron * Jon Hopkins * Reggie Watts * Jon Hassell * Lee \"Scratch\" Perry * Rachid Taha * Damien Dempsey & the cosmic Laraaji * The Necks & Back to Back Theatre === 2010 === Curated by Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed * Lou Reed's Metal Machine Trio * Laurie Anderson's Transitory Life * Rickie Lee Jones * Young Jean Lee * Bardo Pond * Boris * King Khan & BBQ Show * My Brightest Diamond * Chirgilchin === 2011 === Curated by Steve Pavlovic * The Cure * Spiritualized * Chris Cunningham * Yo Gabba Gabba! * Sonny Rollins * Bat For Lashes * Hypnotic Brass Ensemble * Tame Impala * Cut Copy * The Avalanches (DJ Set) * 2manydjs * Tom Kuntz * Architecture in Helsinki * OFWGKTA * Wu Lyf * Azari & III * The Crystal Ark * Dom * Sneaky Sundays * Superbein * Mad Racket * Van She * Flight Facilities * Bag Raiders * Canyons * Andee Frost * Horse Meat Disco * Daniele Baldelli * Club Kooky * The Swiss * Beni * Softwar * Bamboo Musik * Changes === 2012 === * Sufjan Stevens * Nico Muhly * Bryce Dessner * Karen O and KK Barrett\u2019s Stop the Virgens * Florence + the Machine * Janelle Mon\u00e1e * The Temper Trap * Amon Tobin\u2019s ISAM * Seekae * My Brightest Diamond * Danny Brown * MED * Tom Vek * Kindness * Zola Jesus * Efterklang with the Sydney Symphony * Imogen Heap * Asylum * Jonathan Boulet * PVT * Australian premiere of LCD Soundsystem\u2019s documentary Shut Up and Play the Hits === 2013 === * Empire of the Sun * Kraftwerk * Sounds Of The South (featuring Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon) * Bobby Womack * Vangelis - music from Blade Runner * Bish Bosch Ambisymphonic * The Gurrumul Project * Karl Hyde (Underworld) * Sunnyboys * Cloud Control * Live Transmission \u2013 Joy Division Reworked * C.W.
