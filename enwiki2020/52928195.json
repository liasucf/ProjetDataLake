    "text": "The 2021 Greater Manchester mayoral election will be held on 6 May 2021 to elect the mayor of Greater Manchester. This election, alongside other local and mayoral elections across England and Wales, was originally scheduled to take place on 7 May 2020, but was delayed by the UK Government on 13 March 2020 due to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. The election will take place the same day as council elections within the city-region, including the election for the mayor of Salford, as well as elections across England and Wales. It will be the second election to the position of mayor. It will use the supplementary vote as its electoral system. == Background == The mayor of Greater Manchester serves as the directly elected leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The mayor has power over investment directly to the combined authority from the government of \u00a330 million a year for 30 years from 2017. The mayor also incorporates the Police and Crime Commissioner role of the Greater Manchester Police into the post. In addition to these, the mayor has authority over strategic housing planning, transport, adult education and skills, social care and others. The first election for the role was held in 2017, Labour candidate Andy Burnham won with 63% of the vote in the first round. As a result of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United Kingdom the government announced on the 13 March 2020 that it would postpone the mayoral election, along with all other scheduled local government elections across the UK, for one year. The Coronavirus Act 2020 received royal assent 12 days later on the 25 March 2020 giving legal effect to the government's announcement. This was the first such postponement of elections since the foot-and-mouth outbreak caused a one-month delay of the 2001 local elections. === Events prior to the election === In August, Burnham and the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotherham pushed the government to pay workers asked to self-isolate by the contact tracing system during the COVID-19 pandemic, Burnham had also used the Mayors and Combined Authority resources to run a local contact tracing system where the national system had deficits. As the pandemic entered a period of increase in the Autumn the British government created a three tiered system for what local social and economic restrictions would be implemented. Greater Manchester was initially placed at tier 2 restrictions, however the government went into talks with the Mayor and the council leaders to put Greater Manchester into tier 3 restrictions. Burnham cited inadequate financial support for businesses and workers in the city-region- he stated he preferred a short, nation-wide lockdown known as a \"circuit breaker\". == Electoral system == The election will use a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference for candidates. * If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, that candidate wins. * If no candidate receives more than 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated. * The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count. * Voters' ballots whose first and second preference candidates are eliminated are discarded. * Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is one of the top two have their second preference votes added to that candidate's count. This means that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of voters who expressed a preference among the top two. All registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Greater Manchester aged 18 or over on 7 May 2020 will be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. Those who are temporarily away from Greater Manchester (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) will also be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. The deadline to register to vote in the election will be announced nearer the election. ==Candidates== ===Conservative Party=== Laura Evans, a former Trafford councillor and parliamentary candidate, was selected as the Conservative candidate in February 2020. As an executive member on Trafford Council, Evans received the 'Employer Supported Policing Award' for generous changes to officers' paid leave and, in 2014, received a Hero's award for community work. ===Labour Party=== Andy Burnham, the incumbent mayor and former shadow home secretary, announced his intention to seek re-election as mayor of Greater Manchester for the Labour Party in January 2020. ===Liberal Democrats=== Andy Kelly, councillor and leader of the Liberal Democrats group in Rochdale, was confirmed as the first Liberal Democrat candidate on 17 August 2019 following a vote by Liberal Democrat members in Greater Manchester. However, on 11 August 2020 Kelly stood down, stating that the delay in the election for a year has impacted his employment. ===Other candidates=== *Melanie Horrocks was selected as the Green Party candidate in 2019. *Michael Elston is standing as an independent. == Campaign == The incumbent mayor Andy Burnham pledged to take the bus services of Greater Manchester into public ownership, establish an integrated ticket system for all buses and Metrolink trams, make the city-region carbon neutral by 2038 and build 30,000 social homes over the next decade. The BBC has noted that should the metro mayor take the buses back into public ownership it would be the first place outside of London to do so. Laura Evans is critical of Burnham's plans to build on sparser parts of the city-region and the implementation of a Clean Air Zone. ==References== Greater Manchester Category:Elections in Greater Manchester Category:Mayoral elections in England Category:2020s in Greater Manchester ",
