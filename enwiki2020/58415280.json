    "text": "Depiction of the Burmese royal throne by a court painter Palin (; from , lit. \"couch\" or \"sofa\") refers to one of six types of thrones recognized in traditional Burmese scholarship. The palin is a major symbol of the Burmese monarchy and features prominently in Burmese architecture and Burmese Buddhist iconography. The palin is featured on the seal of Myanmar's Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture. == Types of palin == Traditional Burmese scholarship recognizes six types of thrones, namely: # Apar\u0101jitapalla\u1e45ka () - the Buddha's throne # Kamal\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka () - Brahma's throne # Dibb\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka () - nat's throne # R\u0101japalla\u1e45ka () - monarch's throne # Dhamm\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka () - Buddhist monk's throne # A\u1e6d\u1e6dakara\u1e47apalla\u1e45ka () - judge's throne == Usage by Burmese monarchs == The Lion Throne at Mandalay Palace in 1903. In pre-colonial times, the r\u0101japalla\u1e45ka (Burmese yazapalin) seated the sovereign and his main consort. Traditionally, Burmese palaces possessed eight types of thrones, housed in nine palace halls, leading to the Burmese adage, \"eight thrones, 9 palace halls\" (\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a\u101b\u103e\u1005\u103a\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038 \u101b\u103d\u103e\u1031\u1014\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1000\u102d\u102f\u1038\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a). King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat on The Lion Throne at Mandalay Palace The thrones were carved of wood, specifically by hereditary palace carpenters. An auspicious time was chosen by astrologers to commence operations, and construction of these thrones was heralded by a royal ceremony to propitiate spirits. The thrones were simultaneously constructed according to a prescribed list of requirements, coated with resin, and decorated with gold leaf and glass mosaic. The most important throne was the \"Lion Throne\" (S\u012bh\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka), which had a replica in the Hluttaw as well. The thrones used different prescribed motifs and designs, types of wood, and were allocated to specific halls in the royal palace. The thrones were also grouped by height, as follows: #Mah\u0101palla\u1e45ka (\u1019\u101f\u102c\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a\u200b) - #Majjhimapalla\u1e45ka (\u1019\u1007\u1039\u1005\u103b\u102d\u1019\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a) - #Cu\u1e37apalla\u1e45ka (\u1005\u1030\u1020\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a) - Below is a list of these eight types of thrones: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !No. !Name (Pali) !Name (Burmese) !Primary Motif !Type of Wood !Location(s) in Palace !photo |- |1 |S\u012bh\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u101e\u102e\u101f\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Chinthe (lion) |Gmelina arborea |Royal Audience Hall; Hluttaw |100px |- |2 |Bhamar\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u1018\u1019\u101a\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Bumblebee |Cinnamomum tamala |Glass Palace |100px |- |3 |Padum\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u1015\u1012\u102f\u1019\u1039\u1019\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Lotus |Artocarpus heterophyllus |Western Audience Hall |100px |- |4 |Ha\u1e43s\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u101f\u1036\u101e\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Hamsa (bird) |Hopea odorata |Eastern Hall of Victory |100px |- |5 |Gaj\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u1002\u1007\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Elephant |Magnolia champaca |Byedaik (Privy Council) |100px |- |6 |Sa\u1e45kh\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u101e\u1004\u103a\u1039\u1001\u102b\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Conch |Mangifera indica |Regalia Hall |100px |- |7 |Mig\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u1019\u102d\u1002\u102b\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Deer |Ficus glomerata |Southern Gatehouse Hall |100px |- |8 |Mayur\u0101sanapalla\u1e45ka |\u1019\u101a\u102f\u101b\u102c\u101e\u1014\u1015\u101c\u1039\u101c\u1004\u103a |Peacock |Butea monosperma |Northern Gatehouse Hall |100px |} == Usage in Buddhism == A throne seating an image of the Buddha at Botataung Pagoda.
