A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for Minashigo Hutch, in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Ippei Kuri).https://www.lambiek.net/artists/y/yoshida_tatsuo.htm The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of \"Tatsu's child\" and \"sea dragon\" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo. Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach GoGoGo.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/y/yoshida_tatsuo.htm Once adapted to the English language market, it achieved resounding, worldwide success as Speed Racer. Yoshida also created the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets and G-Force: Guardians of Space), Casshan (also known as Neo-Human Casshern, now remade as the live-action film Casshern and the continuity reboot Casshern Sins), Hurricane Polymar and Tekkaman: The Space Knight. Though Tatsuo Yoshida's career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977,https://www.lambiek.net/artists/y/yoshida_tatsuo.htm Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross, Mospeada, Robotech, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas. ==Anime credits== *Ninja Squad Moonlight (1964, also known as Phantom Agents) *Space Ace (1965) *Mach GoGoGo (1967, also known as Speed Racer) *Oraa Guzura Dado (1967) *Dokachin (1968) *Judo Boy (1969) *Hakushon Daima\u014d (1969, also known as Bob in the Bottle or The Genie Family) *Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman (1972, dubbed and re-edited as Battle of the Planets and G-Force: Guardians of Space in North America) *Casshan (1973) *Hurricane Polymar (1974) *Tekkaman: The Space Knight (1975) *Time Bokan (1975) *Godam Gowapper 5 (1976) *Paul's Miraculous Adventure (1976) *Yattaman (1977) *Ippatsu Kanta-kun (1977) *Temple the Balloonist (1977) ==Further reading== *Speed Racer: The Original Manga by Tatsuo Yoshida () ==References== ==External links== * * *Tatsuo Yoshida biography on Lambiek Category:Japanese animators Category:Japanese anime producers Category:1932 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in Japan Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Manga artists Category:Manga artists from Kyoto Prefecture Category:People from Kyoto Category:Tatsunoko Production people ",
