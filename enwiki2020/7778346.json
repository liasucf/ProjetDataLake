    "text": "Stubi\u010dke Toplice () is a municipality in Croatia in the Krapina-Zagorje County. With its centuries-old tourist tradition, it is a very popular vacation spot located in the continental part of the country, serving as a spa center and health resort. Connected by the state road D307 and L202 railway it is located 40 kilometers (25 miles) north from the country's capital city Zagreb. From amalgamation of a local community, the municipality of Stubi\u010dke Toplice was founded on 27 April 1993 as a unit of local government. The name of the town literally means \"the spa of Stubica\", marking it as the spa resort near the town of Donja Stubica. The municipality has four settlements: Pila, Sljeme, Strmec Stubi\u010dki and Stubi\u010dke Toplice. ==History== === Ancient times === Stubi\u010dke Toplice has a long, rich and diverse history. It is believed that the town was known as early as the time of Roman Empire, due to two Roman coins from the era of emperor Hadrian that were found near the pool in 1963. === 13th to 18th century === The first written trace of the place was found in 1209, in the charter of Hungarian-Croatian King Andrew II, where the toponyms \"Toplice\" and \"Stubica\" are mentioned. In the Middle Ages, Stubi\u010dke Toplice was mentioned in 1567, in the investigation against Franjo Tahy, when this area belonged to the Susedgrad-Stubica seigniory. The final battle of the great peasant fight in 1573 took place on the hill Kapel\u0161\u0107ak. At the top of the hill, there was a small chapel of St. Catherine at the time, for which the visitation from 1622 suggests was once a parish church. The sources of thermal water hot springs in Stubi\u010dke Toplice were first described by Hungarian historian Nikola Isthv\u00e1nffy in the 17th century. In the 18th century Stubi\u010dke Toplice was owned by counts Vojkffy - Vojkovi\u0107 from Donje Oroslavje. In 1776 count K. Vojkffy built, besides the springs itself, the first swimming pool, which represents the beginning of a future spa and balneology tradition. === Maksimilijan Vrhovac period and sudden development of the resort (18th and 19th century) === Statue of the bishop Maksimilijan Vrhovac in the central park A significant period in development of Stubi\u010dke Toplice began in 1806, when the Zagreb bishop Maksimilijan Vrhovac (Karlovac, 23. 11. 1752. - Zagreb, 16. 12. 1827) bought nearby Golubovec castle from the Domjani\u0107 family and then thermal springs in Stubi\u010dke Toplice from counts Vojkffy \u2013 Vojkovi\u0107. Until 1811, Vrhovac systematically bought the surrounding land, increased the possession of the place and turned it into a large complex where a modern thermal spa would be built. In 1811, the construction of the main building \u2013 Maksimilijan's bath \u2013 began. The draft was made by the official builder of Bishop Vrhovac \u2013 Heinrich Vesteburg. The great building of the Maksimilijan bath, well-composed and functionally solved, made in baroque style, was a very large investment for its time. It was also the first regulated thermal spa in Croatia, which, in some of the later modifications, still works today. In the park, behind the Maksimilijan bath, a neo gothic-stylized octagonal pavilion was built, named the Steam bath of Dijana, presenting one of the first applications of the neogothicism at this area. St. Catherine chapel in Stubi\u010dke Toplice, built in 1814 The third building of the whole resort complex, the classicist chapel of St. Catherine, was built by the same person. It was built and dedicated in 1814. It is important to emphasize that on the complex of Stubi\u010dke Toplice, the same person, at the same time, built the three objects and applied different styles (baroque tradition, neo-gothic, classicism). At the invitation of the bishop of Maksimilijan Vrhovac in Stubi\u010dke Toplice, the most famous doctors and surgeons come to investigate and confirm the healing and possible health care enabled by using thermal springs. During the 19th century, the owners of the spa were heirs of Vrhovac in Stubi\u010dki Golubovec - Novosel nobles, counts Sermage, barunes Rauch and Barunes Steeb as the last owners. By 1918, the bath did not change its mode of operation. === 20th century - present === The first illustrated tourist guide publication of Stubi\u010dke Toplice, The Mineral Bath and Spas of Stubi\u010dke Toplice, was printed in 1914 when the owner of the spa was Levin Baron Rauch. Activity at the resort and spa was then cut off following World War I. Before the construction of the Zabok-Gornja Stubica railway in 1916, the town was connected with the neighbouring town of Zabok with the spa-owned car. Between the two world wars, the spa became a joint-stock company. Outdoor pools, catering and other facilities are built. Stubi\u010dke Toplice became the most visited excursion site in the vicinity of Zagreb. In the second half of 20th century, significant expansion of the spa began, with upgrading of the baths, rehabilitation center and construction of a new hotel. Prior to 1993, Stubi\u010dke Toplice belonged to the territory of the former Municipality of Donja Stubica (which earned town privileges in 1997). Since the municipality of Stubi\u010dke Toplice was founded on April 27, 1993, a large number of building, infrastructural, culture, educational and social projects in the town were realized through the initiative of Vladimir Bosnar, arguably the most favored and memorable mayor by the town inhabitants, who served in this position from the municipality's inception until his death in 2017 (with a short break in early 2000s). On March 22, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Stubi\u010dke Toplice got hit by 5.5 magnitude earthquake (the strongest one in that area since 1880) which caused no reported casualties and only few minor material damages in the town's area. A 3-metre wide (10 ft) sinkhole opened on the grounds of Special hospital for medical rehabilitation after the earthquake. Neighbouring town Donja Stubica and municipality of Gornja Stubica, however, suffered significant material damage. == Geography == Valley of the creek Vidak with the settlement under Kamenjak forest === Geology and topology === Stubi\u010dke Toplice, one of the smallest municipalities in the county, occupies 25 square kilometers (10.4 square miles), and is 162 meters above sea level. It is situated in the southern part of Krapina-Zagorje County, lying underneath the northern slopes of Medvednica mountain, approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the capital city Zagreb (which is situated beneath the opposite, south side of the mountain). Protected by the hills Kamenjak from north-east and Kape\u0161\u0107ak from south-west, Stubi\u010dke Toplice marks the confluence of the local creeks Vidak and Topli\u010dina. About 80% of the town's area is located in the Nature park of Medvednica - the natural landscape value of the municipality. The whole area of the municipality is covered by the hills that are connected to the Medvednica massif on the southeast and to the Krapina river valley on the north. The area of Stubi\u010dke Toplice is stretched by a dense network of mountain creeks, which belong to the Krapina river basin. It is an area of diverse vegetation made up of forests, plateaux, valleys, meadows and preserved streams of mountain valley watercourses. Oak, hornbeam and beech communities predominate on the slopes of the local hills. However, on the higher and colder parts of Medvednica mountain, the most common are the forests of beech and pine. The vegetation along the creek valleys is primarily made of willows, alders and secondary communities of humid habitats in the form of a tall sedge. Swamp areas occur in places with slower water flows. The settlement borders on the east with the town Donja Stubica, west with the village Kru\u0161ljevo Selo (territory of the town Oroslavje) and Zagreb County, more precisely with the municipality of Jakovlje (village Igri\u0161\u0107e), north with Oroslavje and village Andra\u0161evec (Oroslavje territory), south with the municipality of Jakovlje (more precisely Kraljev Vrh), the city of Zagreb (neighborhood Podsljeme) and southwest with Zagreb County (municipality of Bistra). === Climate === Stubi\u010dke Toplice area has a humid continental climate, with average relative humidity of 75-80%. The average temperature in the town is 9.6 degrees Celsius (49.3 \u00b0F); 18.9 \u00b0C (66.0 \u00b0F) in summer and 0.2 \u00b0C (32.4 \u00b0F) in winter.

It is a complex of three buildings: the oldest part of the hospital, Maksimilijan built in the 19th century and modernized/reconstructed in 2010s, Toplice built in 1973, and the newest Dijana featuring a fitness center, built in 1997. Today, the Special Hospital is a successful provider of health tourism, using the tradition of treatment with thermal water as a natural healing factor and modern medical rehabilitation. Thermal spring water is known for its therapeutic properties, which can be used to treat various injuries, muscle inflammation, rheumatism, etc. It is characterized by high temperature at the source (43\u201363 \u00b0C), which is evidence of great depths. High temperature, and a rich chemical composition give great healing properties.
