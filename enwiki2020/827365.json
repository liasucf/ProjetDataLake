    "text": "James Reginald Cordy (born January 2, 1950) is a Canadian computer scientist and educator who is Professor Emeritus in the School of Computing at Queen's University. As a researcher he is most recently active in the fields of source code analysis and manipulation, software reverse and re-engineering, and pattern analysis and machine intelligence. He has a long record of previous work in programming languages, compiler technology, and software architecture. He is best known for his work on the TXL source transformation language,J.R. Cordy, \"The TXL Source Transformation Language\", Science of Computer Programming 61,3 (August 2006), pp. 190-210 a parser-based framework and functional programming language designed to support software analysis and transformation tasks originally developed with M.Sc. student Charles Halpern- Hamu in 1985 as a tool for experimenting with programming language design.J.R. Cordy, C.D. Halpern and E.
