    "text": "Thinx is a New York based company that makes feminine hygiene products. The company has three brands Thinx, Speax and (BTWN). Thinx is underwear that can be worn during menstruation as a substitute or a supplement to traditional feminine hygiene products. Speax is underwear that can be worn for light and moderate incontinence. (BTWN) is a spin-off of the Thinx collection designed for adolescents dealing with menstruation. The underwear come in a range of styles from boyshorts to thongs, and include two patented technologies. One is to absorb different amounts of blood, and the other absorbs different amounts of urine. The underwear is anti-microbial, moisture-wicking, absorbent and leak resistant. In 2019, Thinx launched Thinx Super which is a double absorbency product that holds up to 4 tampons worth of flow. ==History== Thinx was founded in 2011 by Antonia Saint Dunbar, Miki Agrawal and Radha Agrawal. In 2018, Thinx released a new line called BTWN which offers period underwear for teens and tweens. In June 2019, Thinx released Thinx Air, a quick drying version of its underwear. ==Marketing== Thinx has earned a reputation for its controversial ads. In October 2015, Outfront Media rejected Thinx's subway advertisements due to the fact that the ads used the word \"period\" and included suggestive visuals of food. Following a social media outcry, the ads were finally allowed to be shown. In 2016, Thinx received attention for featuring trans male models in its ads for period underwear. In November 2016, Thinx launched an ad referencing the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape. The San Francisco subway banned the ads due to the use of the word \"pussy\". In November 2017, they created a \"PMS truck,\" a truck visiting three cities, allowing visitors to step inside to shop for Thinx products and talk with brand representatives regarding period health. In 2019, Thinx rolled out a national ad campaign featuring a young boy getting his first period with the tagline: \u2018What if we all had periods?\u201d and subsequent campaigns focused on reducing period stigma by showcasing men. These ads were banned by several TV networks including CBS for being \u201ctoo graphic.\u201d ==Reception== TIME named Thinx period panties as one of the best inventions of 2015. Fast Company named Thinx one of the most innovative companies of 2017, pointing to founder Agrawal's promotional campaigns and her application of \"high-tech merchandise, considered design, and a rule-breaking philosophy\" to launches of new products. ==Advocacy== In 2019 Thinx leaders signed a letter condemning the abortion bans being put into place across the country. ==See also== * Menstrual cup * Tampon * Lunapads * Pantyliners ==References== ==External links== * Company website Category:Feminine hygiene Category:Feminine hygiene brands Category:Menstrual cycle Category:Personal hygiene products Category:Incontinence ",
