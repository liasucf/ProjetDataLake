Above the Clouds: Status Culture of the Modern Japanese Nobility, p. 218; Shirane, Haruo et al. (2000). Inventing the Classics: Modernity, National Identity, and Japanese Literature, p. 113. Many cultured women gathered as wives of Emperors, and court ladies, as well as the maids for these women; court officials often visited these women for influence, literary charm, or romances. Significant contributions to the literature of Japan were created in the K\u014dky\u016b during this period: works such as The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, and many anthologies of waka poems. ==Conflated definitions== The term \"Dairi\" refers not only to the buildings in which the Japanese Imperial family resided; it also refers indirectly to the women of the Imperial family (the K\u014dky\u016b), to the Imperial court of Japan, or as an indirect (now archaic) way of referring to the Emperor himself. The \"Dairi\" -- schematic plan of the Heian-ky\u014d \"Inner Palace\" within the \"Greater Palace\" of the Imperial compound in Kyoto The \"Dai-Dairi\" -- schematic plan of the \"Greater Palace\" within the Imperial complex of official structures and kuge residences The names of the several gates in the walls surrounding the Imperial grounds refer not only to the specific wall-openings themselves; these names were also used to refer indirectly to a nearby residence of an empress whose husband had abdicated, or as an indirect way of referring to the Empress Dowager herself, e.g., , whose official home, after the abdication and death of Emperor Takakura, was located near the Kenrei Gate. In this same way, the term k\u014dky\u016b has multiple meanings, referring to the group of buildings situated near the sovereign's personal apartments where the consorts resided, and also describing the staff of female palace officials assigned to the service of those consorts. More broadly, the term k\u014dky\u016b could be used in identifying the array of consorts below the empress.Lebra, p. 219. ==Structure== The structure of the royal household and ranks for court ladies were defined in Taih\u014d Code and Y\u014dr\u014d Code. In these Codes, there were originally to have been twelve sections, and the various ranks for ladies' of the Imperial household within the K\u014dky\u016b were defined. Fine distinctions were collapsed or expanded in a gradual re-organization which became formalized during the Heian period. For example, in 806, Emperor Heizei elevated the former Fujiwara no Tarashiko (\u85e4\u539f\u5e2f\u5b50) (?-794), also known as Taishi, by giving her the Imperial title of K\u014dg\u014d or empress. This occurred 12 years after her death, and it became the first time this posthumously elevated rank was bestowed.Ponsonby-Fane, P. 318; Many of the court ranks which were not defined in either the Taih\u014d or Y\u014dr\u014d Codes have been in continuous use in the centuries following the early Heian period. ===Imperial Wives=== * Emperor's Wives ** K\u014dg\u014d (\u7687\u540e) (1 person): Empress Consort; also, K\u014dk\u014dg\u014d (\u7687\u540e\u5bae).Titsingh, Isaac.
