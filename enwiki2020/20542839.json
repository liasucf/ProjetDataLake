    "text": "William Toms (born 19 May 1895, date of death unknown) was an Irish footballer. His regular position was as a forward. He was born in Curragh. Toms became a professional after the Great War, in which he was awarded the Military Cross. After the war he broke into Manchester United's first team playing 14 games for them in his first season, but was allowed to leave and joined Plymouth Argyle for \u00a3500 in September 1920. He went on to play for Oldham Athletic, Coventry City, Stockport County, Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra in the Football League. Coventry were the only club where he was successful, which was surprising considering the shambolic state of the club at the time. Toms holds the distinction of scoring Coventry's first hat-trick in the Football League, in the 7\u20131 victory over Wolves on Christmas Day 1922. He left Coventry having been suspended by the club for an undisclosed act of \"misconduct\" along with Arthur Ormston. He went on to play non-league football with Great Harwood, Winsford United and CWS Margarine Works. ==References== ==External links== *MUFCInfo.com profile Category:1895 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Great Harwood F.C. players Category:Winsford United F.C. players Category:Association football forwards ",
