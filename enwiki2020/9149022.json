The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was a monarchy ruled by the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 from 1918 up until World War II. The SFR Yugoslavia was headed first by Ivan Ribar, the President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly (president of the parliament), and then by President Josip Broz Tito from 1953 up until his death in 1980. Afterwards, the Presidency of Yugoslavia assumed the role of the collective head of state, rotating the presidency among representatives of republics and autonomous provinces. However, until 1990 the position of President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was usually the most powerful position (the position often coincided with the position of President). With the introduction of multi-party system in 1990, individual republics elected their own heads of state, but the country's head of state continued to rotate among appointed representatives of republics and autonomous provinces until the country's dissolution. ==Kingdom of Yugoslavia== The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created by the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia (the Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Vardar Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification) and the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austria-Hungary) on 1 December 1918. Until 6 January 1929, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a parliamentary monarchy. On that day, King Alexander I abolished the Vidovdan Constitution (adopted in 1921), prorogued the National Assembly and introduced a personal dictatorship (so-called 6 January Dictatorship). He officially renamed the country Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929 and, although granted the 1931 Constitution, continued to rule as a de facto absolute monarch until his assassination on 9 October 1934, during a state visit to France. After his assassination, parliamentary monarchy was put back in place. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was defeated and occupied on 17 April 1941 after the German invasion. The monarchy was formally abolished on 29 November 1945. All monarchs were members of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty. Peter I, previously King of Serbia (since the May Coup in 1903 against the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty), was proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states. The royal family continued through his son (Alexander I) and his grandson (Peter II). ===List=== {| style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\" ! width=15% | Name !! width=105px | Portrait !! width=20% | Birth !! width=15% | Marriages !! width=15% | Death !! width=10% | Succession right !! width=10% | Note |- | Peter I 1 December 1918 16 August 1921 ()|| Peter I of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes || 29 June 1844 Belgradeson of Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia and Persida Nenadovi\u0107 || Princess Zorka of Montenegro 1883 5 children || 16 August 1921 Belgrade aged 77|| previously King of Serbia (June 15, 1903 \u2013 December 1, 1918), proclaimed King by representatives of South Slav states || Held the title \"King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\".

On 29 November 1943 an AVNOJ conference proclaimed the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, while negotiations with the royal government in exile continued. After the liberation of Belgrade on 20 October 1944, the Communist-led government on 29 November 1945 declared King Peter II deposed and proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. From 1945 to 1953, the President of the Presidium of the National Assembly was the office of the Yugoslav head of state. The post was held by Ivan Ribar. From 1953 to 1963, Josip Broz Tito simultaneously held the offices of the President of the Republic (head of state) and the President of the Federal Executive Council (head of government). The 1963 Constitution renamed the state as Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and divided the office of the President of the Republic from the Presidency of the Federal Council, even if the President of the Republic retained the power to preside over the Government when it met, on the French model.Constitution of 1963 The 1974 Constitution provided for a collective federal presidency, consisting of representatives of the six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists, with a Chairman in rotation. Notwithstanding, this constitutional provision was suspended because Tito was declared President for Life, thus chaired the collective presidency on a permanent basis. After his death in 1980, one member was annually elected President of the Presidency and acted as head of state. ===List=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| ! rowspan=2| Portrait ! width=20% rowspan=2| Name ! rowspan=2| Representing ! colspan=3| Term of office ! rowspan=2| Political party ! rowspan=2| Note |- !
