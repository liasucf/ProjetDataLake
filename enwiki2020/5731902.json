    "text": "Lawrence Joseph Shehan (March 18, 1898 \u2013 August 26, 1984) was a liberal, American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Baltimore from 1961 to 1974 and was made a cardinal in 1965. His legacy as a Catholic prelate is noted for transferring priests accused of sexual abuse to new posts without disciplining them or warning parishioners. ==Early life and education== Lawrence Shehan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Thomas Patrick and Anastasia Dames (n\u00e9e Schofield) Shehan. His father operated a tailors' supply business. He received his early education at local parochial schools in Baltimore. In 1911, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. Charles College, a college seminary in Ellicott City. After graduating from St. Charles, Shehan enrolled at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore in 1917. He earned a B.A. in 1919 and a M.A. in 1920. In 1920, he was sent to continue his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Urban University, where he received a Doctor of Sacred Theology in 1923. ==Priesthood== On December 23, 1922, Shehan was ordained a priest by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica at the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Following his return to the United States, he was first assigned as a curate at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., a post which he held until 1941. In addition to his pastoral duties, he served as assistant director (1929\u201336) and director (1936\u201345) of Catholic Charities in Washington. Shehan served as pastor of St. Patrick's Church from 1941 to 1945. During his pastorate, he ended racial segregation at the parochial school in 1942 and hosted the Washington branch of the Catholic Interracial Council. He was named a papal chamberlain in 1939, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1945. ==Episcopacy== ===Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore=== On November 17, 1945, Shehan was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore- Washington and titular bishop of Lydda by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 12 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Peter Leo Ireton and John Michael McNamara serving as co-consecrators. He was named pastor of SS. Philip and James Church in Baltimore in 1946. In 1947, when the Archdiocese of Washington was separated from Baltimore, Shehan was assigned to remain in Baltimore. He served as vicar general of the archdiocese from 1948 to 1953. ===Bishop of Bridgeport=== Shehan was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Bridgeport in Connecticut on August 25, 1953. His installation took place on December 2 of that year. During his tenure in Bridgeport, he established eighteen new parishes, built twenty-four new churches, and founded three high schools. He also formed a Catholic Youth Organization, promoted vocations to the priesthood and religious life, and began parish ministry for the increasing number of Hispanic, Portuguese, and Brazilian immigrants. In October 1960, he convoked the first synod of Bridgeport to complete the initial organization of the diocese and to establish a uniform code of practice and discipline for the clergy. A non-profit youth center in Bridgeport, CT is named after him (The Cardinal Shehan Center). On October 1, 2019, a report by former Connecticut state Judge Robert Holzberg accused Shehan and other former bishops of the diocese of transferring priests accused of sexual abuse rather than reporting them. ===Archbishop of Baltimore=== On July 10, 1961, Shehan returned to Baltimore as its Coadjutor Archbishop (with right of succession) and Titular Archbishop of Nicopolis ad Nestum. He succeeded Francis Patrick Keough as Archbishop of Baltimore on December 8 of that same year. In this position, he led the nation's first diocese and held precedence, except for Cardinals created earlier and without the honorary title of primacy, over the Church in America. After the Supreme Court ruled to remove prayer from public schools in 1962, Shehan warned that \"secularization threatens to become a sort of state religion established by court decree\".TIME Magazine. On Second Thought...

Cardinal Shehan worked with his friend Harry Lee Doll, Episcopal Bishop of Maryland and President of the Maryland Council of Churches on both civil rights and ecumenical issues.
