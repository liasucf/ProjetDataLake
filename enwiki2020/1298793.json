He is referred to as \"Kid Thunder\" by his fans.Shane Sutcliffe - Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia ==Career== Sutcliffe was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, before moving to Nanaimo, British Columbia at the age of 12. After winning 22 \"Toughman Contests\", he made his professional boxing debut in 1992 at the age of 17. His first fight resulted in a sixth-round decision victory over Joe Wade. Shortly afterward he moved to Los Angeles, California and eventually Las Vegas, Nevada, to train with the legendary Eddie Futch. He won other fights by unexpected margins, including a 3-round defeat of Ray Phillips Rocky lives!: heavyweight boxing upsets of the 1990s - p.128 In 1997, he moved to and fought out of Montreal, Quebec, after signing a contract with International Boxing Management Interbox. On April 3, 1998, he defeated Ben Perlini via sixth round knockout to win the Canadian Heavyweight championship. In his third defense of the title on February 5, 1999, he lost via 12th-round TKO to former World titleholder Trevor Berbick in Montreal. His contract was then dropped by Interbox as a result. He challenged Berbick again for the title on May 26, 2000 in Vancouver. However, he dropped a close 12 round unanimous decision in that contest.Berbick retains Canadian heavyweight boxing title, CBC Sports Sutcliffe took over 2 years off from boxing to start a family after losing to fellow Canadian Patrice L'Heureux on November 30, 2001. After the birth of his son, Sutcliffe worked construction to provide a steadier source of income for his new family. However, he returned to the sport in 2004, dropping decisions to Wesley Martin and Louis Monaco. As of 2005, he lives in Nanaimo with his family and trains out of there with Don Arnott, a local kickboxing sensei. He is what is termed a journeyman fighter, one who \"journeys\" to a variety of places (often on short notice) to provide relatively easy competition for up-and-coming prospects or fading former champions. He counts Tyrell Biggs, Leon Spinks, Trevor Berbick, Oleg Maskaev, Brian Nielsen, and David TuaIBF Junior Lightweight Champion Roberto Garcia'sTitle Defense Against Diego Corrales to Headline, Publication: Business Wire amongst the many opponents he has faced throughout his career.
