    "text": "The Du Pen Fountain is a water fountain at the former Washington State Library building on the Washington State Capitol campus in Olympia, Washington, in the United States. The sculptor, Everett Du Pen (1912\u20132005), was well known in the Northwest, and chairman of the Sculpture Department at the University of Washington when he was commissioned for the piece in 1955. The fountain is made of of copper-enriched bronze, green terrazzo, and cement. An element of the fountain is a pair of salmon spitting water. The fountain, along with the nearby and much larger Tivoli Fountain replica, is shut down by the state property administration agency during summer droughts. The artist also created the Fountain of Creation at the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair. The Seattle fountain is also nicknamed Du Pen (or DuPen) Fountain. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Category:Bronze sculptures in Washington (state) Category:Culture of Olympia, Washington Category:Fish in art Category:Fountains in Washington (state) Category:Outdoor sculptures in Olympia, Washington Category:Washington State Capitol campus ",
