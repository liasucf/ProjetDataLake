    "text": "Robin David Peverett was a 'House parent' at Pestalozzi Children's Village before becoming a 'housemaster' at DCPS Coursehorn in 1963, and later headmaster of Dulwich College Preparatory School (near Cranbrook, Kent) from circa 1967 to 1990. ==Sentence== He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years, after admitting nine charges of indecently assaulting seven pupils (six girls and one boy, between the ages of 10 and 13) in the late 1960s/1970s. After lengthy legal wrangling and plea-bargaining he pleaded guilty and was allowed to walk free. Judge David Griffiths said, a serious breach of trust which would normally warrant a custodial sentence, but due to Peverett's accomplishments - there were glowing testimonies from former pupils, staff, parents, fellow heads and even one ex-cabinet minister - his was an exceptional case. He was later stripped of his OBE (awarded 1995) following his conviction. 2003: Another male victim came forward. CPS declined to take up the case. 2014: A further male victim filed a complaint with Kent Police who indicated that they were aware of two other male victims who were not part of the original criminal and civil cases. Again due to the elapsed time and a lack of sufficient corroborating evidence, CPS declined to take up the case. 2017 - Civil case against Robin Peverett and Dulwich Preparatory School in Central London County Court continues. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:Living people Category:People stripped of a British Commonwealth honour Category:English sex offenders Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
