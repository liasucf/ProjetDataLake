Adults are ochreous brown, both wings banded and marked with pale ochreous, in the forewings there is a streak near the base and another at the apex as if portions of one band. There is also a broad band from the hindmargin a little beyond the middle, to the outer margin above the middle. On the hindwings there is a subbasal band from the abdominal margin, short, and with a white band on its inner edge, and a broad discal band which below the apex, and at the anal angle touches the outer margin. All these bands are longitudinally streaked with bright orange lunular lines close together. There is also a brown spot at the end of each cell, as well as a dark brown marginal line.Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. 1902 ==Subspecies== *Drapetodes magnifica magnifica (Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo) *Drapetodes magnifica denotata Watson, 1961 (eastern Borneo) ==References== Category:Moths described in 1902 Category:Drepaninae ",
