    "text": "A rotation government ( memshelet chilufim) is one of the ways of forming of a government in Israel. It is a government that, during its term, will alternately be headed by a Knesset member who formed the government and another Knesset member. In a number of cases, the alternate prime minister will replace the incumbent prime minister, without a need for the government to resign. ==History== A rotation government in Israel practically took place in 1986, when Yitzhak Shamir became prime minister and replaced Shimon Peres, under a non-binding rotation deal. The idea again took hold during the 2019\u201320 Israeli political crisis and the negotiations for the forming of the 35th Israeli government after the elections to the 23rd Knesset, and was included in the coalition agreement between the Likud and Blue and White, but was also made binding under broad changes in the Basic Law: The Government: It obviates the need for the resignation of the incumbent prime minister in order to implement the rotation - the incumbent prime minister's term automatically expires when the rotation time comes, and he swaps positions with the alternate prime minister, without the need of forming a new government. In addition, in the rotation government the status of alternate prime minister is stronger than the position of an Acting prime minister in a rotation deal, and various steps by the prime minister requires the approval of the alternate prime minister. ===Other countries=== After the 2020 Irish general election a rotation government was also agreed between Miche\u00e1l Martin (who will serve as Taoiseach until 2022) and Leo Varadkar.Agreement reached on draft programme for government RT\u00c9 News, 2020-06-15. In the campaign for the 2020 North Macedonian parliamentary election, the Democratic Union for Integration made its participation in any coalition contingent on the nominee for Prime Minister being an ethnic Albanian, which both the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia and VMRO-DPMNE have refused. On 18 August, the SDSM and DUI announced that they had reached a deal on a coalition government as well as a compromise on the issue of an ethnic Albanian Prime Minister. Under the deal, SDSM leader Zoran Zaev will be installed as Prime Minister, and will serve in that position until no later than 100 days from the next parliamentary elections. At that time, the BDI will propose an ethnic Albanian candidate for Prime Minister, and if both parties agree on the candidate, that candidate will serve out the remaining term until the elections. ==Characteristics== In the rotation government, the alternate prime minister is a member of the Knesset who is designated to serve as prime minister, and also one who served as the incumbent prime minister and then moved in turn to serve as the alternate prime minister. The incumbent prime minister and alternate prime minister are sworn in together. In the following cases, the alternate prime minister will replace the incumbent prime minister: * the termination of the incumbent prime minister's term. * the resignation of the incumbent prime minister. * the passing of the incumbent prime minister. * the passing of 100 days, in which the incumbent prime minister has been incapacitated for health reasons only. * the resignation of the incumbent prime minister from the Knesset. The law stipulates that \"the number of ministers identified as having an affinity for the prime minister will be equal to the number of ministers who are identified as having an affinity for the alternate prime minister; However, if the number of ministers shall not be equal, the government will establish a voting mechanism according to which the voting power of all the prime minister-affiliated ministers shall be equal to the voting power of all the alternate-prime minister-affiliated ministers, or rules on how decisions will be taken to ensure such a ratio.\" The alternate-prime minister shall be acting prime minister. Some of the clauses in the Basic Law: The government dealing with the incumbent prime minister will also apply to the alternate prime minister, including Clause 18 (d), which stipulates that the prime minister's term expires upon his conviction in a final judgment on an offense in which he is infamous. The Basic Law stipulates that when the prime minister is convicted as aforesaid, the alternate prime minister will replace him, and when the alternate prime minister is convicted as aforesaid, the government will not be deemed to have resigned. ==Criticism== The changes in the basic law have attracted public and media criticism, arguing that this is changing the Israeli system of government. The signing of the rotation deal aiming at changing basic laws led to the petitioning of the High Court against the agreement that led to changes in the agreement. The petition was rejected on the grounds that \"it is not yet time\" to petition against the agreement before the law is passed. Upon passing the law on second and third reading, the petitions were re-filed. ==References== Category:Politics of Israel Category:Israeli governments ",
