    "text": "Alpha Volantis (\u03b1 Vol, \u03b1 Volantis) is a binary star system in the southern constellation Volans. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +4.00, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements made with the Hipparcos spacecraft, it is located at a distance of 125 light years from the Sun. As of 2010, the two components of this system had an angular separation of 0.0318\u2033 along a position angle of 286.9\u00b0. The magnitude difference between the two components is 0.1. It is considered a member of the Sirius supercluster. The primary component is an Am star with a stellar classification of kA3hA5mA5 V. This notation indicates the star has the weak calcium II K-line of an A3 star, and the hydrogen and metallic lines of an A5 star. It has an estimated age of 427 million years. In 1992, it was found to be emitting an infrared excess, suggesting the presence of a circumstellar disk of dust. However, subsequent observations have not confirmed this. ==References== Volantis, Alpha Category:Volans (constellation) Category:A-type main-sequence stars 044382 3615 Category:Gliese and GJ objects Category:Durchmusterung objects 078045 Category:Binary stars Category:Am stars ",
