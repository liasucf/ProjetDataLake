The convictions of all three individuals were quashed on 25 November 1991 after scientific tests suggested the men's confessions had been fabricated. Silcott received compensation of \u00a317,000 for his wrongful conviction. Two of the investigating police officers were prosecuted for fabricating evidence but were acquitted in 1994. Silcott received a further \u00a350,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police in an out-of-court settlement which ended a civil action against the force for malicious prosecution.Silcott police pay-out 'disgraceful' BBC News Silcott was convicted in 1979 and sent to prison for six months for his part in a nightclub brawl. His other convictions include murder, burglary, malicious wounding and possession of an offensive weapon. In 1979 he was tried for and acquitted of murder; the first of his three murder trials. In 1989, the London School of Economics Students' Union elected Silcott as Honorary President, as a protest against miscarriages of justice. Silcott served 18 years imprisonment for the murder of boxer and nightclub bouncer Tony Smith, for which he was on bail when Blakelock was killed. Silcott claimed that he killed Smith in self-defense after an altercation in which he feared for his life and felt he had no choice but to attack, but was disbelieved by the jury.David Rose meets Winston Silcott The Observer He was released from Blantyre House Prison in October 2003. Silcott had also served a six-month prison sentence for assault in a nightclub prior to his conviction for the murder of Smith.

After his initial arrest he was held in police cells for two days for failing to reveal his real address. == References == ==External links== *Interview (The Observer, 18 January 2004) *Silcott in bid to cut youth crime (BBC News, 16 August 2005) Category:1959 births Category:20th-century English criminals Category:21st-century English criminals Category:Black English people Category:British people convicted of burglary Category:British people convicted of theft Category:British people of Montserratian descent Category:Criminals from London Category:English people convicted of assault Category:English people convicted of murder Category:Living people Category:Overturned convictions in England Category:People acquitted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
