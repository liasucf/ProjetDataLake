    "text": "World Order is a book about global politics written by Henry Kissinger. == Summary== In World Order, Kissinger explains four systems of historic world order: the Westphalian Peace born of 17th-century Europe, the central imperium philosophy of China, the religious supremacism of political Islam, and the democratic idealism of the United States. Kissinger aims to provide a window into today's struggling framework of international order. == Reception == The New York Times praised the book, declaring, \"his writing functions like a powerful zoom lens, opening out to give us a panoramic appreciation of larger historical trends and patterns, then zeroing in on small details and anecdotes that vividly illustrate his theories.\" The book has also garnered positive reviews from Hillary Clinton, The Wall Street Journal, Time, The Los Angeles Times, and The Guardian, among many others. == References == Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Books by Henry Kissinger Category:Penguin Press books ",
