The bathing machine was a device, popular from the 18th century until the early 20th century, to allow people to change out of their usual clothes, change into swimwear, and wade in the ocean at beaches. Bathing machines were roofed and walled wooden carts rolled into the sea. Some had solid wooden walls, others canvas walls over a wooden frame, and commonly walls at the sides and curtained doors at each end. The use of bathing machines as part of the etiquette for sea-bathing was more rigorously enforced upon women than men, but it was to be observed by both sexes among those who wished to behave respectably. Especially in Britain, men and women were usually segregated, so that people of the opposite sex should not see them in their bathing suits, which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen in public. ==Use== Sea bathing in mid Wales c.1800. Several bathing machines can be seen The bathing machines in use in Margate, Kent, were described by Walley Chamberlain Oulton in 1805 as: People entered the small room of the machine while it was on the beach, wearing their street clothing. In the machine they changed into their bathing suit, although men were allowed to bathe nude until the 1860s, placing their street clothes into a raised compartment where they would remain dry.Kidwell, Claudia. Women\u2019s Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1968. Mermaids at Brighton swim behind their bathing machines in this engraving by William Heath, c. 1829. Probably all bathing machines had small windows, but one writer in the Manchester Guardian of May 26, 1906 considered them \"ill-lighted\" and wondered why bathing machines were not improved with a skylight. The machine would then be wheeled or slid into the water. The most common machines had large wide wheels and were propelled in and out of the surf by a horse or a pair of horses with a driver. Less common were machines pushed in and out of the water by human power. Some resorts had wooden rails into the water for the wheels to roll on; a few had bathing machines pulled in and out by cables propelled by a steam engine. Once in the water, the occupants disembarked from the sea side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only one door would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy. Some resorts employed a dipper, a strong person of the same sex who would assist the bather in and out of the sea. Some dippers were said to push bathers into the water, then yank them out, considered part of the experience. Man and woman in swimsuits, c. 1910. The woman is exiting a bathing machine. Once mixed-sex bathing became socially acceptable, the days of the bathing machine were numbered. Bathing machines would often be equipped with a small flag which could be raised by the bather as a signal to the driver that they were ready to return to shore. ==History== According to some sources, the bathing machine was developed in 1750 in Margate, Kent, though this may relate primarily to the \"modesty hood\" (bathing costumes were not yet common and most people bathed naked). \"Mr. Benjamin Beale, a Quaker, was the inventor of the Bath Machine. Their structure is simple, but quite convenient; and by means of the umbrella, the pleasures of bathing may be enjoyed in so private a manner, as to be consistent with the strictest delicacy.\" In Scarborough Public Library there is an engraving by John Setterington dated 1736 which shows people bathing and popularly believed to be first evidence for bathing machines, however Devon claims this was a year earlier in 1735.Library Etchings (archived) at Devon Queen Victoria's bathing machine (restored) Bathing machines were most common in the United Kingdom and parts of the British Empire with a British population, but were also used in France, Germany, the United States, Mexico, and other nations.

By the start of the 1920s, bathing machines were almost extinct, even on beaches catering to an older clientele.Manning-Sanders, Ruth. Seaside England. B T Batsford, 1951. The bathing machines remained in active use on English beaches until the 1890s, when they began to be parked on the beach. They were then used as stationary changing rooms for a number of years. Most of them had disappeared in the United Kingdom by 1914.Bathing by Jane Austen Society of Australia However, in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, Eric Ravilious was able to paint bathing machines on wheels with winches still in use as late as 1938.Lara Feigel, Alexandra Harris, Modernism on Sea: Art and Culture at the British Seaside (2009), p. 212 In many places around the world they have survived to this day as stationary bathing boxes. ==In fiction== * In The Hunting of the Snark a Snark's fondness for bathing machines is listed as the fourth \"unmistakable mark\" that Snark hunters should consider. * In Iolanthe, the Lord Chancellor's \"Nightmare Song\" describes a passenger ship as not much larger than a bathing machine. * The use of the bathing machine and segregated swimming is depicted in the ITV series Sanditon, based on the unfinished novel of the same name by Jane Austen. * In \u2018\u2019Persuasion\u2019\u2019 by Jane Austen, the principal street in the town of Lyme is said to be \u201canimated with bathing machines\u201d during the season. *In \u2018\u2019Vanity Fair\u2019\u2019 (1847-48) by William Makepeace Thackeray, chapter 22, after Amelia Sedley and George Osborne's wedding: \"Some ten days after the above ceremony, three young men of our acquaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on the one side and blue sea on the other, which Brighton affords to the traveller.
