    "text": "Elizabeth \"Liz\" Sugrue ; (c. 1740/1750 \u2013 1807), also known as Lady Betty, was an Irish executioner. A minor historical character, she remains a well-known figure in popular culture. ==Life== Born around 1750, Sugrue was left destitute after the death of her farmer husband; evicted from her home, she set off with her two children on the long walk to the town of Roscommon. On the way, her younger child died of starvation and exposure, leaving only her eldest, P\u00e1draig. According to William Wilde (1815\u20131876), who collected stories about her from locals, Elizabeth had a \u201cviolent temper\u201d and P\u00e1draig often threatened to leave home. Elizabeth begged him to stay, but in April 1775, following particularly harsh treatment, he departed; some sources claim he enlisted in the British Army, others he emigrated to British North America and joined the Continental Army. She became a recluse, taking in lodgers for a few pennies a night but hearing less and less from her son as time passed, she became increasingly bitter. Supposedly, a man came to stay at her house in 1789 and she murdered him, before discovering he was in fact her long-lost son; arrested, convicted and sentenced to death, she was held in what is now known as the 'Old Gaol'. Twenty-five others were also due to be hanged, including sheep and cattle thieves and \u2018Whiteboys\u2019, young men who tore down fences and hedges surrounding what had once been common land. On the day of her hanging, the hangman was ill; Betty volunteered to take his place, allegedly after three others refused. She lived in the prison thereafter, carrying out executions and floggings, including a number of rebels executed during the 1798 Rebellion. She was known to draw portraits of the men and women she hanged on the wall of her lodgings with charcoal. In 1802, her own sentence was commuted, in recognition of her service to \u201cthe safety of the public\u201d and when she died in 1807, she was buried in an unmarked grave inside the walls of Roscommon Jail. The account held in the National Folklore Collection claims she was murdered by a prisoner. ==Legacy== In 1884, an article on her written by Charlotte O'Conor Eccles appeared in the Weekly Irish Times.Weekly Irish Times, Saturday, February 9, 1884. She is the centrepiece of a narrative poem by \u00c1ine Miller, titled Betty Sugrue- Hangwoman; The Woman From Hell, and the main character in Declan Donnellan's 1989 play Lady Betty. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * Category:18th-century births Category:1807 deaths Category:People from County Kerry Category:Irish executioners Category:Irish female murderers Category:Irish female criminals Category:18th-century Irish criminals Category:Filicides ",
