The Fire of Anatolia or Anadolu Ate\u015fi is a Turkish dance group consisting of 120 dancers, several choreographers and other technical staff. The group has performed in more than 85 countries from the United States to China and Japan, in front of an audience of approximately 20 million people altogether.Fire of Anatolia \u2013 History Fire of Anatolia holds two Guinness records, one for fastest dance performanceFire of Anatolia with 241 steps per minuteFire of Anatolia \u2013 Past Events \u2013 09 Agustos and another for largest audience, 400,000 people in Ere\u011fli, in the Black Sea Region of the country. On 9 February 2013, Fire of Anatolia performed at the CCTV New Year's Gala. The head of the group is Mustafa Erdo\u011fan. ==History== The concept of a large dance group performing Anatolian dances mixed with modern dance and ballet was a long desired dream of Mustafa Erdo\u011fan, who conducted folk dance studies at Bilkent University. In 1999 he established the foundations of the group then called Sultans of the Dance. There were advertisements published in local newspapers in search of dancers. Out of 750 applicants Mustafa chose 90, who started working on their physical and dance abilities, under strict supervision. The masters of the dance company educate their dancers themselves, teaching them the basics of ballet, modern dance or folk dance, depending on the dance educational background and the area the dancers need improvements in. The group had its first performances in 2001 and started a world tour a year later, already under the name Fire of Anatolia. The number of dancers now reaches 120, which means that the group is able to perform the same show in two or three different locations at the same time. According to Erdo\u011fan, Fire of Anatolia is currently among the three largest dance groups in the world.Mustafa Erdo\u011fan \"Anadolu Ate\u015fi\" ile ger\u00e7ekle\u015fen hayallerini ve yeni projelerini Ece Pirim\u2019e anlatt\u0131 (Mustafa Erdo\u011fan talked to Ece Pirim about his upcoming projects and his realized dreams with Anadolu Atesi) \u2013 Kanalturk The dance group has performed so far in more than 40 countries, including the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Russia, Qatar, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, France, Egypt (just in front of the Pyramids), The Netherlands and Mexico.
