    "text": "Alexander \"Alec\" Coxon (18 January 1916 \u2013 22 January 2006) was an English cricketer who played for Yorkshire. He also played one Test match for England in 1948. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman stated, \"Coxon's Test career was abrupt \u2013 much like the man himself. An ever-willing seam bowler, he was one of several tried in the search for a partner for Alec Bedser, but he did himself no favours with a brusqueness which could upset\". ==Life and career== Coxon was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. World War II delayed Coxon's first-class debut for Yorkshire to 1945, when he was 29. Coxon was an aggressive fast- medium bowler who played for England once \u2013 against Australia in 1948 at Lord's. There were rumours of an argument with Denis Compton, and his prickly nature was later attested to by Brian Close. Coxon retired after the 1950 season, allegedly in umbrage at his non-selection for the forthcoming Ashes tour, and moved to play Minor counties cricket with Durham. He played 29 times for that county between 1951 and 1954, taking 127 wickets and scoring 1,047 runs with two centuries. His highest score was 102 not out against Yorkshire Second XI at Scarborough in 1952. Also in 1952, he achieved his best bowling figures for Durham; nine for 28 and six for 58 against Staffordshire. He also played professionally with Sunderland, where he took 753 wickets at 8.73 runs apiece, and scored 3,764 runs at an average of 34.21. In 1959, he moved to South Shields where he took 443 wickets for 10.28 and scored 2,663 runs at 23.63. He had shorter spells with both Wearmouth and Bolden, before finally retiring from the sport some distance past his 50th birthday, although still coaching at Whitburn Cricket Club in 1979. He also played soccer for Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C. in wartime matches. He kept up a keen interest in club cricket until the end. Clement Seymour \"Sir Coxsone\" Dodd CD (26 January 1932 \u2013 4 May 2004) was named after the cricketer : Coxsone Dodd was a Jamaican record producer who was influential in the development of ska, dub and reggae in the 1950s, 1960s and beyond. He was nicknamed \"Coxsone\" at school due to his talent as a cricketer (his friends compared him to Alec Coxon, member of the 1940s Yorkshire County Cricket Club team). ==References== ==External links== *A profile of Alec Coxon by Dave Liverman Cricket Society Autumn 2008 *Cricinfo page on Alec Coxon *CricketArchive page on Alec Coxon Category:1916 births Category:2006 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:Durham cricketers Category:Cricketers from Huddersfield Category:English cricketers of 1946 to 1968 Category:H.
