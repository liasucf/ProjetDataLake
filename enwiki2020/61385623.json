    "text": "Garabito statue in the Garabito Canton City Hall The empire, domain or lordship of King Garabito was a vast territory controlled by Huetar King Garabito and that extended through most of the Central Valley of Costa Rica from the Virilla River (natural border with the also Huetar but smaller Se\u00f1or\u00edo del Guarco) in modern San Jos\u00e9 to the Atlantic Slope in what is now the north of the country (Alajuela, Grecia and San Carlos mainly). Garabito's domain transcended the borders of the Western Huetar Kingdom where it had multiple vassal populations such as Coyoche, Abacara, Chucasque, Cobobici (possibly Corobic\u00ed), Cobux, Yurust\u00ed and Barva, and also included several submissive peoples but not incorporated into their kingdom; the Botos, Tises and Catapas. Although the exact location of its capital is unknown, it is speculated that it could be in San Ram\u00f3n near where it made war raids against the botos. The empire was also an enemy of the also vast Kingdom of Nicoya, of ethnic chorotega unrelated to the hu\u00e9tares but with the Nahuas instead and that represented other of the largest pre-Hispanic Costa Rican empires. Garabito presented a fierce resistance to the Spanish conquering expansions, considerably delaying the process of conquest and colonization and causing many headaches to the Spanish governors such as Juan de Cavall\u00f3n and V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, but he would finally be defeated and his domain annexed to the governorship of Costa Rica under the name that the Spanish designated as Garabito province. ==References== Category:Former monarchies of Costa Rica Category:16th century in Costa Rica Category:Indigenous peoples in Costa Rica Category:Former empires ",
