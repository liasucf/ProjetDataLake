Persebaya won the title after a 3\u20132 win over PSMS in the final at Gelora Bandung Lautan Api Stadium, Bandung on 28 November 2017. ==Overview== ===Player regulations=== Starting this season Liga 2 was an under-25 tournament (born on or after 1 January 1992), with a maximum of five overage players allowed.

Persebaya Surabaya, previously not recognized, also participated this season. === Name changes === * Villa 2000 was changed to Celebest after moving their homebase from South Tangerang to Palu in January 2016. * Persigo was changed to Semeru after moving their homebase from Gorontalo to Lumajang in January 2017. * Bintang Jaya Asahan merged with YSK 757 Karimun to become 757 Kepri Jaya after moving their homebase from Asahan to Batam in February 2017. * Persires Sukoharjo was changed to Lampung Sakti after moving their homebase from Sukoharjo to Bandar Lampung in February 2017. * Laga was changed to Sragen United after moving their homebase from Surabaya to Sragen on 27 February 2017. * Persebo was changed to Madura after moving their homebase from Bondowoso to Sumenep in March 2017. * PS Bangka changed their name to PS Timah Babel in April 2017. * Perseka changed their name to Perseka Manokwari after moving their homebase from Kaimana to Manokwari in July 2017. ===Stadium and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
