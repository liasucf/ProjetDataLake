    "text": "{| |} The Phyllis Cormack is a 25-meter (82-foot) herring and halibut seine fishing boat, displacing 99 tons and crewed by up to 12 people. The wooden vessel was built in 1941 in Tacoma, Washington, by Marine View Boat Works. It was chartered in (northern hemisphere) autumn 1971 by the Don't Make a Wave Committee to travel to Amchitka to protest against the planned nuclear tests there. Greenpeace International calls this trip \"our founding voyage.\" ==Name== The boat's name derives from that of the wife of its skipper, John Cormack. ==1971 Greenpeace charter== The vessel was renamed or nicknamed Greenpeace for the voyage, a name subsequently used by the organisation that sprang from the organising committee.https://web.archive.org/web/20090401232914/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/about/history/the- founders Greenpeace International calls this expedition \"the founding voyage\". The nickname for the boat arose from \"the dual ecological and antiwar nature of their mission\". At the time, the boat was deemed to be \"a bit jury-rigged.\" The boat's crew was Canadian, and included Bob Hunter, Ben Metcalfe, John Cormack, Jim Bohlen and Patrick Moore. The boat's departure and arrival point was Vancouver, British Columbia, though an unauthorised stop was made in Akutan, Alaska, resulting on a U.S. Coast Guard boarding and a charge of a U.S. customs violation. The crew's sight of a grisly, abandoned whaling station in Akutan was compared to the Communist Party of Kampuchea's Khmer Rouge Killing Fields and it was called a \"pivotal\" moment that turned Greenpeace on to the idea of saving the whales. ==1975 Greenpeace charter== In June 1975, the Phyllis Cormack was chartered by the Greenpeace Foundation, a Vancouver, B.C. ecological organization, to harass USSR and Japanese whaling; the crew included persons fluent in Japanese and in Russian. Greenpeace named the season's campaign \"Project Ahab\"; it ran about 50 miles offshore California, from Eureka in the north to past San Francisco in the south. The New York Times reported that for \"the first time in the history of whaling, human beings had put their lives on the line for whales\". The Japanese Fisheries Agency stated the harassers were fanatics for whom their movement \"is like a religion\". ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Individual sailing vessels ",
