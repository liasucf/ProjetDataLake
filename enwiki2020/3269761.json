A similar ride, Xtreme Swing, opened at Valleyfair the same year. ==Specifications== Skyhawk is a Screamin' Swing type ride built by S&S; Worldwide. The structure itself is tall at its highest point, the equivalent height of a ten-story building, making it the world's largest swinging thrill ride. It consists of two swinging arms, both tall, seating 20 across and 20 back to back (40 total). At full swing, the ends of the arms approach high off the ground\u2014as high as a twelve-story building\u2014and achieve a maximum velocity of 65 miles- per-hour\u2014faster than most wooden roller coasters. The ride lasts about one minute, and can accommodate 800 passengers per hour. Riders must be or taller. Riders are restrained by a lap bar. ==Incidents== * On July 26, 2014, a cable supporting one of the carriages on the pendulum came loose, injuring two guests. One guest was treated on the scene, while the other was taken to a hospital then released. Skyhawk reopened on August 1, 2014. ==References== ==External links== * Official Skyhawk page * Skyhawk Photo Gallery at The Point Online Category:Pendulum rides Category:Amusement rides manufactured by S&S; \u2013 Sansei Technologies Category:Cedar Point Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2006 Category:Cedar Fair attractions Category:2006 establishments in Ohio ",
