The game was first created as part of a 7-day game jam, but was later \"reimagined\" and re-titled \"The Endless Express\" in 2016, however, the project was discontinued, with its work-in-progress build publicly released. Endless Express was released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems. == Development == Endless Express was the product of a five person team collaborating at a \"7DFPS\" game jam in 2014 - an event which is meant for first-person shooter video games, as noted by PC Gamer. == Gameplay == Endless Express' starts off with the player waking up in a train station. Using only a watch and a train timetable, they must find their way home, being sure to catch the correct trains. The game is a combination between accelerated time and semi-real-time, with train stations being in real time and the travel being accelerated. The game also makes use of different animation styles, with low-polygonal textures for terrain, while using a cartoonish style elsewhere. == Reception == In a November 2014 article, PC Gamer called the gameplay of Endless Express \"compelling\", with Kotaku stating that it was \"full of charm.\" Killscreen described the game as having a \"dreamlike quality...magical realism.\" ==References== ==External links== Endless Express on itch.io: *Original 2014 version *Updated 2016 version Category:First-person adventure games Category:Game jam video games Category:2014 video games Category:2016 video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Train simulation video games Category:Windows games ",
