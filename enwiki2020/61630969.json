Go to his wife, Elizabeth Gan-Go, for whom the mall was dedicated, during their 33rd wedding anniversary. In 2014, E-Mall opened its service lane as part of its rezoning strategies to be a one-stop shop in Cebu. It occupies almost half of the mall's third level. The site used to be the previous location of the World of Fun and the mall's activity center, which was then converted into a kiddie play area. ==Incidents== ===Accidental firing of service firearm=== On March 30, 2009, a security guard wounded three persons when he accidentally fired his service firearm yesterday noon outside E-Mall.
