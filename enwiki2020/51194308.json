    "text": "Timothy R. Bedding (born 21 July 1966) is an Australian astronomer known for his work on asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations. In particular, he contributed to the first detections of solar-like oscillations in stars such as eta Bootis, beta Hydri and alpha Centauri. He also led the discovery, using data from the Kepler space telescope, that red giants oscillate in mixed modes that are directly sensitive to the core properties of the star and can be used to distinguish red giants burning helium in their cores from those that are still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Bedding has worked in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney since 1995Professor Tim Bedding - Staff Profile at the University of Sydney and was Head of School from 2012 to 2018.History of the University of Sydney School of Physics He received the University's Excellence in Teaching Award in 1999 and was appointed as a Payne Scott Professor in 2019.Academics recognised for leadership, teaching and research impact In 2007 the asteroid 231470 Bedding was named in his honour. Bedding was a member of the Australian Ultimate Frisbee team and participated in the 1990 World Championships held in Oslo, Norway.
