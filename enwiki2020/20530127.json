    "text": "Smoked Hams is the 21st animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on April 28, 1947, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Wally Walrus tries to get some sleep in the day, while Woody Woodpecker continually keeps Wally awake by mowing the lawn and burning leaves which produce a plume of smoke. In retaliation, when Woody himself goes to sleep, he falls into a basement, where Wally torments him with all kinds of irritating sounds. ==Notes== *Smoked Hams was the first entry in the series (and the second \"cartune\" after Musical Moments from Chopin) that Woody's top knot was seen pushed forward, instead of slicked back (as usually seen during this period), for an extended period in some scenes. This was very similar to how his top knot looked in his upcoming third design; the recurring change would continue with all remaining entries that featured Woody's second design. *In July 1991, Smoked Hams was re released theatrically as an added short accompaniment to the film Problem Child 2. This was a last minute decision by Universal Studios as a way of making the PG-13 film look suitable for family audiences after the first cut of that film received an R rating. == References == *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1947\".
