    "text": "Brown Sugar is a 2002 American romantic comedy film written by Michael Elliott and Rick Famuyiwa, directed by Famuyiwa, and starring Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan. The film is a story of a lifelong friends, A&R; Andre and Editor-in- Chief Sidney. The two can attribute their friendship and the launch of their careers to a single, seminal childhood moment - the day they discovered hip- hop on a New York street corner. Now some 15 years later, as they lay down the tracks toward their futures, hip-hop isn't the only thing that keeps them coming back to that moment on the corner. The movie was released in the US on October 11, 2002 and ran for 16 weeks, grossing $27,363,891 domestically and $952,560 in the foreign sector for a worldwide total of $28,316,451. ==Plot== Brown Sugar is a film that follows the evolving relationship between Sidney (Sanaa Lathan), an attractive young woman who has just been appointed the editor-in-chief of the hip-hop magazine XXL, and Dre (Taye Diggs), an A&R; for Millennium Records. They have been bound together since their early childhood. The news that Dre is preparing to be married to Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a successful entertainment attorney, sends Sidney into a subconscious tizzy. Suddenly, she doesn't seem to know how to behave around Dre anymore, and an impulsive kiss on the eve before his wedding sends fissures of doubt cracking in every direction. Dre gets married and begins to settle into his life when a decision to sign an untalented but commercially viable rap group forces Dre to choose between his love for true hip-hop and his job. He decides to quit his job and start his own record company, focusing on bringing back the real hip hop that his generation fell in love with. Reese, however, is not understanding and thus not supportive of this venture. Additionally, as Sidney draws closer to Dre due to their partnership in the label, jealousy develops over Dre and Sidney's friendship. Sidney, who also has begun to live her life with a budding relationship with Kelby (Boris Kodjoe) receives a proposal from her boyfriend which she accepts. Turmoil ensues when Dre finds out Reese has been having secret liaisons with a man from the gym (who texts Reese to confirm a rendezvous). Dre brings Sid to bust her in the act. This leads to a night of shared passion between Dre and Sid and opens Sid's eyes to the fact she is not prepared to marry Kelby. She calls off the engagement and while searching for Dre sees Reese and Dre in a parting embrace that she misconstrues as more. While at Hot 97 waiting for Cavi's (Mos Def) first single to play on the Angie Martinez show, Dre hears Sid talking about her new book I Used to Love H.I.M. Though based on her love affair with hip-hop, it really is a chronicled timeline of her love affair with Dre. He recognizes this and rushes over to the station to confront his feelings, as well. Meanwhile, in the production booth, Sid's cousin Francine (Queen Latifah) finally asks Cavi out on a date, which is something he has been trying for since their first meeting. The film ends with Cavi's song playing in the same park where their love of hip-hop began. ==Cast== *Taye Diggs \u2014 Andre Romulus 'Dre' Ellis **Marc John Jefferies - Young Dre Ellis *Sanaa Lathan \u2014 Sidney 'Sid' Shaw, Dre's best friend ** Aaliyyah Hill - Young Sidney *Mos Def \u2014 Christopher Anton 'Cavi' Vichon, a cabby (and secret rapper) who later befriends Dre *Nicole Ari Parker \u2014 Reese Marie Wiggam Ellis, a district attorney who later marries Dre *Boris Kodjoe \u2014 Kelby Dawson, an NBA star who Sid meets and starts dating *Queen Latifah \u2014 Francine, Sid's cousin *Wendell Pierce - Simon, Dre's boss at Millennium Records *Erik Weiner \u2014 Ren, half of The Hip Hop Dalmatians * Reggi Wyns - Ten, half of The Hip Hop Dalmatians * Venida Evans - Aunt Betty * Liza Lapira - Hot 97 Receptionist * Wyking Jones - Bartender cameo appearances *Big Daddy Kane - Himself *Kool G Rap \u2014 Himself *Pete Rock \u2014 Himself *De La Soul \u2014 Themselves *Tariq Trotter aka Black Thought \u2014 Himself *Jermaine Dupri \u2014 Himself *Talib Kweli \u2014 Himself *Common - Himself *Method Man - Himself *Slick Rick - Freestyler *Dana Dane - Freestyler *Jen Taylor - Boathouse Attendant *Doug E.
