    "text": "Alice Crocker Lloyd (December 9, 1893 \u2013 March 3, 1950) was the University of Michigan's longest serving Dean of Women and a trailblazer in progressive educational programs and ideals for young women at the time. She proved to be both a confidante and advisor to her students, but also cautioned against falling into the trappings of social life that could be found in the collegiate experience. In many ways her advice is still relevant to women seeking an education today. ==Early life and education== Lloyd was born on December 9, 1893, in Ann Arbor, MI. She was the first child of Alfred H. Lloyd and Margaret Crocker Lloyd. Academia ran in her family; her father was the former dean of the University of Michigan's graduate school, a former professor of philosophy, and also served as acting president of the University in 1925. She had a relatively typical upbringing, growing up on what was at the time the outskirts of Ann Arbor and attending the now defunct Ann Arbor High and later Milton Academy in Milton, MA. She liked to collect poems as a child, showing a romantic side to her often described ambitious nature. Alice had a sister, Anna in addition to brothers Frederick and Putnam. Frederick T. Lloyd fought in World War I and unfortunately suffered from PTSD after his return home. He spent the rest of his life in a Battle Creek veteran's hospital. Putnam later moved on to become a doctor and move to New York. Lloyd's family had deep roots in the country. She is the descendant through her mother's side of John Putnam, a prominent early settler in Salem, MA. During the summer the Lloyds would go to Piseco, NY in the Adirondacks where they engaged in numerous outdoor activities like canoeing, hiking and swimming. Lloyd found the latter to be the most enjoyable and took very easily to it. As a student, she was described as being serious and successful. Lloyd also had very progressive ideas for her time, most likely due to her liberal father and mother who had moved from the East coast. For undergraduate school she attended the University of Michigan and graduated in 1916. During her undergraduate years she was considered a devoted friend and engaged in theatre, becoming an excellent singer. This showed in her election to the soloist position at Ann Arbor's local Episcopal Church. However, her educational experience was marred by an overseas battle; World War I broke out during her time at Michigan. This ultimately led to her post-graduation decision to stay close to home. She spent time teaching at a small school for two years. Later on, she served time training at the Luke's Hospital Training School of Nurses in New York City and earned her R.N. certificate in 1921. She subsequently worked as a probation officer with juvenile delinquent girls in Wayne County, Detroit. She was offered a position in 1926 as an Adviser of Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, which then led to her receiving the position as Dean of Woman in 1930. == Dean of women == One of Lloyd's crowning achievements during her years at Michigan was the development of women's dormitories. Two major residence halls were built under her watchful eye; Stockwell and Mosher\u2014Jordan. She also was beneficial in the planning of the dorm that would eventually bear her name. Supportive programs for the female students were very important to her as well. The Women's Athletic Building was just one of the many programs that advanced the quality of life for these undergraduate women due to her efforts. Most notably, was her dedication to the Michigan League, which was newly completed when she began her term as Dean. It proved to be a headquarters for activities of women students as well as for alumnae. This was a pivotal time for women in higher education, particularly at Michigan. Lloyd knew this and dealt with it in a reserved and mature manner, especially when it came to women's hours and overcrowding in housing. She wrote editorials in the Daily, attempting to bridge the gap between faculty and students. This was frequently a sore spot due to the shifting position over in loco parentis, which was causing an irritation amongst the student body in regards to the strict curfew hours women held. Additionally, the lack of student housing for women with the influx of students was turning into a bigger problem than seen in past years. Alice was not a champion for Greek Life, which had become popular at the time she came to her position at the University. She believed school had become a place where social life mattered more than the academics. The experience outside of the classroom had become just as important as the academics. Despite her attitude that school should be a place for learning, away from social distractions, Lloyd still maintained an idealistic view on the world and education. In a speech given to the National Association of Deans of Women from January, 1944 she stated, \"Education must be inspired by courageous and spiritual leadership and must touch the hearts of people as well as train their minds.\" Additionally, in a speech given at the American Legion Auxiliary Services on August 16, 1945, she said, \"It is through generosity and compassion and honesty and love that we will build a new world.\" Lloyd was often at odds with an administration that was still stuck in the past. She grappled with the need for more authority in her position as Dean of Women. In a letter to Provost James P. Adams on October 20, 1945, she expressed her displeasure with the \"relationship\" between the Dean of Women and the women's residence halls stating: > \"I feel very keenly that the direction of the educational program, i.e. > language tables, forums, etc., the social program, the student government > organization, and the supervision and choice of the personnel dealing > directly with the students (the house directors and new assistants) should > be the responsibility of the Dean of Women.\" Relationship with Greek Life Despite her displeasure towards the institution itself, Lloyd would frequently insert herself into the politics of the Greek System at the school and sometimes saw it as beneficial to student life; it provided student housing and a place to engage in structured activities outside of the classroom. She was vocal about her beliefs and had no trouble expressing them to the fraternities and sororities as a whole, often speaking at Panhellenic meetings. These speeches were very transparent and produced very reasonable yet, forward thinking ideas: > \"It is my belief that social organizations such as sororities and > fraternities should choose their members solely on a basis of character, > integrity, and personality without regard to race or nationality or > religious creed.\" and > \"To stress their value as house-clubs is to bring them into direct > competition with the dormitories which in many instances now offer better > living conditions. To emphasize the social life they offer is to bring very > forcibly to light the fact that the social situation has changed from the > earlier intimate group life within the sorority house to the present day > social activities outside the house. Both these factors have weakened their > position. What will strengthen it?\" == Personal life and accomplishments == Not much is known about Alice's personal life outside of the walls of the University, partially because her personal endeavors were so entrenched in the care and keeping of her pupils. She was described as being tall with strong features, yet despite this she would never marry. Her parents in comparison appeared to have a happy courtship filled with love letters. Her younger sister, Anna would also come to marry. Nevertheless, Alice was the godmother to many of her friends' children and took great interest in her pupils, turning the professional into the personal. Lloyd was also incredibly active outside of the University, proving to be a prominent figure in the Ann Arbor community. She was a member of the Episcopal Church in Ann Arbor, serving as the Chairman of the Music Committee and also a member of the Ann Arbor Dramatic Season Chamber of Commerce in Ann Arbor where she would serve on the executive committee from 1937-42. This interest in the arts would present itself in town life; her shared home with her mother and aunt became a gathering space for artists and performers. She even served during 1936 as a member of the Board of Directors for Cranbrook Kingswood School. Also having an interest in politics, she became a member of the Democratic Party. She was a member of the National Association of Deans of Women, the American Association of University Women, Phi Beta Kappa, and Phi Kappa Phi. Her dedication to the University of Michigan led her to become the president of the Association of Deans of Women from 1941 to 1943. She also served on the committees for the American Council on Education. ===Commitment to nursing and war efforts=== Lloyd was very involved in the war efforts during WWII. She was appointed to the State's Advisory committee for the Women's Army Corps and to two national committees for the U.S. Navy: the special committee on college women students and the war, and the advisory education council on women's services. She proved so instrumental in these efforts that she was awarded the Navy's certificate of recognition. She also often spoke to nursing students about their duties not only to the country and soldiers under their care, but to themselves. In a speech given to nursing students she remarked: > \"It is important that you have outside interests, but it is even more > important that you have great interest in your profession, that you see it > on the high plane where it belongs in order that you may have pride in it. I > am interested in education because it is the only hope in a democratic > country like ours. The striving of man for an education is an effort on his > part to understand better the universe in which he lives.\" == Death == Alice Lloyd's story would unfortunately come to a close too soon. She died only at the age of 56 on March 3, 1950, after suffering from a longterm illness. She died in her home on 1735 Washtenaw Ave, the same house she was raised in. She was survived by her mother, sister and two brothers. Her death deeply affected her friends, family and the community at large. The new women's residence hall constructed during her time as Dean was named in her honor following her death. In a letter to Lloyd's sister addressing the naming of the new women's dorm after Alice, the acting Dean of Women, Sarah L. Healy speaks of trying to get in touch with Lloyd's mother to tell of the event, but had been advised not to, due to the sensitive nature of the matter. === Post-mortem === Many people dedicated their time to creating memorials and funds in Lloyd's name post death. A significant amount of effort was put into creating these, which shows just how much of an impact she made on the life of her students. There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she should be included in the dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole. == References == Category:1893 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:American Episcopalians Category:Milton Academy alumni Category:American women nurses ",
