    "text": "Principles of Economics is a leading political economy or economics textbook of Alfred Marshall (1842\u20131924), first published in 1890. It ran into many editions and was the standard text for generations of economics students. ==Writing== Marshall began writing the Principles of Economics in 1881 and he spent much of the next decade at work on the treatise. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought; the first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim that established him as one of the leading economists of his time. The second volume, which was to address foreign trade, money, trade fluctuations, taxation, and collectivism, was never published at all. Over the next two decades he worked to complete his second volume of the Principles, but his unyielding attention to detail and ambition for completeness prevented him from mastering the work's breadth. ==Contents== *Preface ===Book I.

Marshall summarises how wealth is distributed through society. > \"The efficiency as compared with the cost of almost every class of labour, > is thus continually being weighed in the balance in one or more branches of > production against some other classes of labour: and each of these in its > turn against others. This competition is primarily \"vertical\": it is a > struggle for the field of employment between groups of labour belonging to > different grades, but engaged in the same branch of production, and > inclosed, as it were, between the same vertical walls. But meanwhile > \"horizontal\" competition is always at work, and by simpler methods: for, > firstly, there is great freedom of movement of adults from one business to > another within each trade; and secondly, parents can generally introduce > their children into almost any other trade of the same grade with their own > in their neighbourhood. By means of this combined vertical and horizontal > competition there is an effective and closely adjusted balance of payments > to services as between labour in different grades; in spite of the fact that > the labour in any one grade is mostly recruited even now from the children > of those in the same grade. The working of the principle of substitution is > thus chiefly indirect. When two tanks containing fluid are joined by a pipe, > the fluid, which is near the pipe in the tank with the higher level, will > flow into the other, even though it be rather viscous; and thus the general > levels of the tanks will tend to be brought together, though no fluid may > flow from the further end of the one to the further end of the other; and if > several tanks are connected by pipes, the fluid in all will tend to the same > level, though some tanks have no direct connection with others. And > similarly the principle of substitution is constantly tending by indirect > routes to apportion earnings to efficiency between trades, and even between > grades, which are not directly in contact with one another, and which appear > at first sight to have no way of competing with one another.\" - VI.XI.6-7 *XII General Influences of Economic Progress. Marshall discusses the causes of economic development. > \"But after all the chief cause of the modern prosperity of new countries > lies in the markets that the old world offers, not for goods delivered on > the spot, but for promises to deliver goods at a distant date.\" - VI.XII.3 > \"The key-notes of the modern movement are the reduction of a great number of > tasks to one pattern; the diminution of friction of every kind which might > hinder powerful agencies from combining their action and spreading their > influence over vast areas; and the development of transport by new methods > and new forces. The macadamized roads and the improved shipping of the > eighteenth century broke up local combinations and monopolies, and offered > facilities for the growth of others extending over a wider area: and in our > own age the same double tendency is resulting from every new extension and > cheapening of communication by land and sea, by printing-press and telegraph > and telephone.\" - VI.XII.10 *XIII Progress in Relation To Standards of Life. ===Appendices.=== *Appendix A The Growth of Free Industry and Enterprise. *Appendix B The Growth of Economic Science. *Appendix C The Scope and Method of Economics. *Appendix D Uses of Abstract Reasoning in Economics. *Appendix E Definitions of Capital. *Appendix F Barter. *Appendix G The Incidence of Local Rates, With Some Suggestions As To Policy. *Appendix H Limitations of the Use of Statical Assumptions in Regard To Increasing Return. *Appendix I Ricardo's Theory of Value. *Appendix J The Doctrine of the Wages-Fund. *Appendix K Certain Kinds of Surplus. *Appendix L Ricardo's Doctrine As To Taxes and Improvements in Agriculture. ==Contribution== Marshall's influence on modifying economic thought is difficult to deny. He popularized the use of supply and demand functions as tools of price determination (previously discovered independently by Cournot); modern economists owe the linkage between price shifts and curve shifts to Marshall. Marshall was an important part of the \"marginalist revolution;\" the idea that consumers attempt to adjust consumption until marginal utility equals the price was another of his contributions. The price elasticity of demand was presented by Marshall as an extension of these ideas. Economic welfare, divided into producer surplus and consumer surplus, was contributed by Marshall, and indeed, the two are sometimes described eponymously as 'Marshallian surplus.' He used this idea of surplus to rigorously analyze the effect of taxes and price shifts on market welfare. Marshall also identified quasi-rents. ==See also== *Economics, a similarly influential later textbook *History of economic thought ==References== ==Further reading== * ::Also available as: ==External links== *full text of Principles of Economics by Marshall * Category:1890 non-fiction books Category:1890 in economics Category:Economics books Category:Science textbooks ",
