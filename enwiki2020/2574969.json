    "text": "North Sydney Council is a local government area on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, established on 29 July 1890 through the amalgamation of three boroughs. The area is bounded by Willoughby to the north and north-west, Northern Beaches to the north-east, Mosman to the east, Lane Cove to the west and Sydney Harbour to the south. It covers an area of approximately and as at the had an estimated population of . The administrative seat of North Sydney Council is located in the suburb of North Sydney, approximately north of the Sydney central business district. The Mayor of North Sydney Council is Cr. Jilly Gibson, an independent politician. Gibson was first elected on 8 September 2012 and was re-elected for a second term on 9 September 2017. == Suburbs and localities in the local government area == Suburbs serviced by North Sydney Council are: Localities serviced by North Sydney Council include: ==History== Council Chambers, . The area now covered by North Sydney Council originally comprised three municipalities: the Borough of East St Leonards from 1860 (Kirribilli, Cremorne Point, Milsons Point), the Borough of St Leonards from 1867 (Cammeray, Mosman, Waverton, Wollstonecraft) and the very small Borough of Victoria from 1871 (McMahons Point and parts of North Sydney and Lavender Bay). These boroughs lasted until 29 July 1890 when they merged to form the \"Borough of North Sydney\". Following a petition submitted by residents in 1892, on 11 April 1893 the Mossman Ward of North Sydney confirmed its separation as the Borough of Mosman, being proclaimed by Lieutenant-Governor Sir Frederick Darley. From 28 December 1906, following the passing of the Local Government Act, 1906, the council was renamed as the \"Municipality of North Sydney\". North Sydney Municipal Council first met in the 1885 East St Leonards Town Hall on Alfred Street, Milsons Point, that had been built for the Borough of East St Leonards, and took up residence in the North Sydney Council Chambers on Miller Street, North Sydney, from 12 July 1926. ===Post-war council history and Mack era=== With the completion of the Warringah Expressway in 1968, a construction that involved the wide-scale demolition of areas in the centre of the municipality, North Sydney was split in two and development in the North Sydney central business district took off. With this development resulting in the destruction of the heritage streetscape of the North Sydney CBD, threatening the character of surrounding areas, several movements of North Sydney residents formed to oppose and manage the pace and extent of development. One prominent group was the North Sydney Civic Group, which came to prominence in the late-1970s amid dissatisfaction with the North Sydney Council. The Council's plans for the demolition of the historic Council Chambers following a fire in 1976, led to further tensions and resulted in the council being turned out at the 1980 elections, replaced by a North Sydney Civic Group-aligned council and Ted Mack elected mayor. Mack's term as mayor, was marked by a single-minded and innovative approach to the local governance issues facing North Sydney at the time. Mack began his term as mayor by selling the mayoral car to help buy community buses. During his term as mayor, North Sydney Council introduced the \"open government policy\" which honoured a promise of openness and transparency of council decisions, and established a precinct committee system, which allowed for greater citizen input in council issues. The pioneering North Sydney Heritage Study was released in 1982 and in 1989 the new Local Environmental Plan was gazetted. With an increase in council revenues, Mack reinvested the funds in a public works program into several new and renovated parks, car parks, childcare facilities, community and sports centres, and major extensions and renovations to the Stanton Library and North Sydney Oval. Infrastructure also took on a distinct local identity, with Council investment on new street signs, bus shelters, colour schemes of public buildings, paving and street furniture. In 1982, council voted to popularly elect the mayor, with Mack being directly elected twice to the position in 1983 and 1987 before retiring in 1988. With the passing of the Local Government Act, 1993, the Municipality of North Sydney was legally renamed as North Sydney Council and aldermen were renamed councillors. ===2016\u201317 amalgamation proposals=== A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the North Sydney Council merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of the North Sydney and Willoughby Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 145,000. The alternative, proposed by Warringah Council on 23 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Pittwater, Manly and Warringah councils. As a consequence of Warringah's proposal, the New South Wales Minister for Local Government Paul Toole proposed that the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman Councils merge. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. ===Town Clerks and General Managers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Term !Notes |- | William Barnett Smith | 16 August 1890 \u2013 1 September 1921 | |- | Percy Augustus Temple | September 1921 \u2013 February 1923 | |- | Hubert Perry | February 1923 \u2013 10 July 1938 | |- | Leslie Fitzpatrick | 11 July 1938 \u2013 1966 | |- | Don W.

All succeeding directly-elected mayors, Crichton (1988\u20131991), Nolan (1991\u20131995), McCaffery (1995\u20132012), and Gibson (2012\u2013date) have only been elected as mayor and have not served concurrently as a Ward alderman/councillor. | rowspan=3| Direct quadrennial election |- | 1995\u20132017 | 13 (3 per ward, 1 Mayor) | Cremorne Ward Tunks Ward Victoria Ward Wollstonecraft Ward |- | 2017\u20132021 | 10 (3 per ward, 1 Mayor) | Tunks Ward Victoria Ward Wollstonecraft Ward |- | From 2021 | 10 (5 per ward) | St Leonards Ward Cammeraygal Ward | Biennial election by Councillors |} ===Current composition and election method=== North Sydney Council is composed of ten Councillors, including the Mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office, operating on a Mayor\u2013council government system of operation. The Mayor is directly elected while the nine other Councillors are elected proportionally from three wards, each electing three Councillors. Although the fixed term of the Council is four years, due to delays caused by amalgamations and the COVID-19 pandemic, the current term from 9 September 2017 will expire in September 2021. A referendum passed at the same time at the 2012 council elections reduced the number of wards from four to three (Cremorne Ward was abolished) and the number of councillors from 13 to 10, inclusive of the popularly elected mayor, which took effect from the 2017 election. A referendum passed at the 2017 election also altered the system of electing the mayor. Starting in 2020, the mayor will be elected by the councillors from among their members for a two- year term. As the wording of this referendum did not specify a reduction in the number of elected positions in the Council (such as from 10 Councillors to 9), the Office of Local Government required Council to specify a ward structure of equal numbers to each ward: two wards of five councillors or five wards of two councillors. At its extraordinary meeting held on 20 January 2020, the Council voted to adopt a two-ward model on a north/south boundary with the northern ward named \"St Leonards Ward\" and the southern ward named \"Cammeraygal Ward\" from the next election. The most recent election was held on 9 September 2017, and the makeup of the Council, including the Mayor, is as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Party!!Councillors |- | | | Independents | align=right | 9 |- | | | Liberal Democratic Party | align=right | 1 |- | | Total | align=right | 10 |} The current Council, elected in 2017, in order of election by ward, is: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Ward!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!Party!!Notes |- | Mayor | | | Jilly Gibson | Independent | Mayor 2012\u2013date Tunks Ward Councillor 1999\u20132004, Victoria Ward Councillor 2004\u20132012 |- | rowspan=\"3\"|Tunks Ward | | | Tony Carr | Independent | Elected 2012 |- | | | Dr Alanya Drummond | Independent | Elected 2017 |- | | | Stephen Barbour | Independent | Elected 2008.
