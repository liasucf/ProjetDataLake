    "text": "In the Fade () is a 2017 German drama film written and directed by Fatih Akin. It stars Diane Kruger as a German woman whose husband and son are killed in a terrorist attack perpetrated by neo-Nazis. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where Kruger won the Best Actress award. It was selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, making the December shortlist, but it was ultimately not nominated. It did, however, win the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. ==Plot== Several years after he spent four years in prison for drug dealing, during which time he has studied business administration and gotten married, Kurdish-German Nuri \u015eekerci lives happily with his German wife, Katja, and their 6-year-old son, Rocco. One day, Katja drops Rocco off at Nuri's office, a small travel agency in Hamburg where he also does translation and taxes, so she can spend the afternoon with a friend. Heading out, she warns a young blonde woman leaving her new bicycle in front of the store that it will get stolen if she doesn't lock it up. When Katja returns that night, the street is blocked off. A nail bomb has gone off, injuring dozens and killing Nuri and Rocco. Katja tells the police about the woman with the bike, which had a travel compartment. The police rule out a Jihadist motive as Nuri was neither religious nor political and initially focus on revenge by drug traffickers, though they release a composite sketch of the blonde woman. After Katja declines Nuri's parents' request to bury the bodies in Turkey, Nuri's mother coldly informs her at the funeral that her grandson would still be alive if Katja had been a better mother. Devastated, Katja uses drugs and later attempts suicide by slashing her wrists, but changes her mind and bandages them upon hearing a phone call come in (while she was bleeding) that Neo-Nazi suspects have been caught. Married couple Andr\u00e9 and Edda M\u00f6ller go on trial. Disgusted with his son, Andr\u00e9's father testifies how he found bags of nails, fertilizer, and diesel in the garage, but the defense establishes that unknown people could have gained access to the garage through a hidden key. Forensics match the bomb to the material found in the garage, which bears fingerprints from the couple and an unknown individual, who could have been a store employee but who the defense claims could have been the real culprit. Nikolaos Makris, a Greek hotel owner, claims the M\u00f6llers were staying in Greece at the time of the bombing, but it is revealed he is also a member of the far-right party Golden Dawn and the M\u00f6llers liked Facebook photos of him at a rally in Germany. Katja testifies about seeing Edda outside the office but the defense calls her testimony into question by pointing out her drug use. The couple are acquitted by the court and go into hiding. Katja searches for the M\u00f6llers in Greece by finding Makris' hotel. Katja follows Makris and finds the M\u00f6llers living in an RV on the beach. She builds a nail bomb and plants it under the vehicle in a backpack, but changes her mind and retrieves it. After a few days' contemplation, she returns to the beach and sees the M\u00f6llers enter the RV. After a few moments, she enters wearing the backpack; the vehicle explodes within seconds. ==Cast== * Diane Kruger as Katja \u015eekerci, wife of Nuri and mother of Rocco * Denis Moschitto as Danilo Fava, the \u015eekercis' attorney * Johannes Krisch as Herr Haberbeck, attorney for the M\u00f6llers * Samia Chancrin as Birgit, Katja's best friend * Numan Acar as Nuri \u015eekerci, husband of Katja and father of Rocco * Ulrich Tukur as J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6ller, father of Andr\u00e9 * Rafael Santana as Rocco \u015eekerci, 6-year-old son of Nuri and Katja * Hanna Hilsdorf as Edda M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist * Ulrich Friedrich Brandhoff as Andr\u00e9 M\u00f6ller, Neo-Nazi terrorist * Yannis Ekonomides as Nikolaos Makris ==Production== The terrorist attack in the film was loosely based on the events of the 2004 Cologne bombing, when Neo-Nazis detonated a nail bomb, also hidden above a bicycle rack, on a busy commercial street in a heavily Turkish neighborhood in Cologne.
