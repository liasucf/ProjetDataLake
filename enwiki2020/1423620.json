Dvorna in Dr\u017eavna Tiskarna, p. 120.) is a town in Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Vrhnika. It is located on the Ljubljanica River, 21 km from Ljubljana along the A1 motorway. ==Geography== Big Drnovica Collapse Sinkhole Vrhnika lies at the southwest end of the Ljubljana Marsh near the sources of the Ljubljanica River, where the Ljubljana Basin opens up between the foot of Ljubljana Peak (, ) and Ulovka Hill (). The territory of the town extends south onto the Logatec Plateau (), where the Big and Little Drnovica Collapse Sinkholes () are found.\u010cepon, Barbara. 2010.

A rich network of springs and streams originates and joins near the town to form the source of the Ljubljanica. ==Name== The settlement at the location of today's Vrhnika was attested in antiquity as Nauportus in Latin, and as \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 and \u039d\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek. Medieval attestations of the name include de superiory Laybaco in 1300, Oberlaybach in 1308 (and Ober Laybach in 1309), and Vernich in 1481, corresponding to the modern Slovene name. In the past, the town was known as Oberlaibach in standard German. The Slovene name is probably a compound of vrh 'top, summit' + nika or nikve 'creek, spring', referring to the source of the Ljubljanica River. The Latin name Nauportus is a compound of navis 'boat' + portus 'transfer', referring to a place where cargo had to be transferred from boats to pack animals or carts along a trade route. A mythological reinterpretation of the Latin name as referring to the portage of a boat itself (specifically, the Argo) appears in Pliny the Elder's Natural History.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo\u017eba ZRC, pp. 468\u2013469. ==History== In Roman times, Nauportus was an important communication point.Curk I. et al. (1993). In the footsteps of Roman soldiers in Slovenia. Ljubljana: Zavod Republike Slovenije za varstvo naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine Slovenije. Vrhnika as it exists today started to develop in the High Middle Ages. Vrhnika became a market town and was among the wealthiest towns in CarniolaJohann Weikhard von Valvasor: The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, published 1689, translated extracts published 1984 by Mladinska knjiga, pp. 240, 241. up to the early 18th century, when it started to lose importance. Nevertheless, it remained one of main transportation junctions in Inner Austria because of its strategic location on the crossroads between the trade routes from Trieste to Vienna and from Rijeka to Klagenfurt.Oro\u017een Adami\u010d M., Perko D., Kladnik D. (1995). Krajevni leksikon Slovenije. Ljubljana: DZS. The development of the town was strongly impaired by the construction of the Austrian Southern Railway in the 1840s, which bypassed it. From then on, it started losing importance, becoming a satellite town of Ljubljana, which has remained up to this day. ===Mass grave=== Pikec Valley Mass Grave Vrhnika is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Pikec Valley Mass Grave () is located at the bottom of a sinkhole southwest of the town, on Sve\u010d Hill near the Vojc house. It contains the remains of six German prisoners of war that were murdered in May 1945.De\u017eman, Jo\u017ee. 2009.
