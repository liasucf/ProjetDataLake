It also makes provision for company insolvency Bankruptcy laws vary somewhat between Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England. In England, Wales & Northern Ireland, the applicable law is the Insolvency Act 1986. Bankruptcy requires the surrender of all valuable assets to the Official Receiver, including any property interests. It is extremely unlikely the business activities would be permitted to continue. Additionally, there are quite a number of other legal restrictions upon the bankrupt individual. Individuals are therefore cautioned by the Insolvency Service to explore whether alternatives exist.UK Insolvency Service, A Guide To Bankruptcy Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs) operate in England, Wales & Northern Ireland as a contractual agreement between the insolvent individual and the creditors they owe money to. IVAs are facilitated by an Insolvency Practitioner and are an agreement that the individual will repay agreed instalments over a fixed period of time.UK Insolvency Service, Alternatives To Bankruptcy In Scotland, the Protected Trust Deed serves a similar purpose.Accountant in Bankruptcy, Scotland's Insolvency Service Protected Trust Deeds === Insolvency Act 2000 === This act was introduced in two stages: 2 April 2001 and 1 January 2003. It made provision for a new moratorium method to address financial difficulties faced by small companies. Relevant to sole traders, it also somewhat amended Individual Voluntary Arrangements procedures. ==== Key amendments for sole traders ==== The Insolvency Act 2000 somewhat modified procedures for Individual Voluntary Arrangements. Previously, under the Insolvency Act 1986 an individual had to initially apply to the court for an interim order. This order would then be followed by the next legal procedures towards arranging the IVA itself. The Insolvency Act 2000 removed the need to apply for an interim order, except where a petition for the individual\u2019s bankruptcy already applied. There were also changes aiming to fulfil the overall purpose of the IVA, namely coming to an acceptable agreement between the individual and those they owed money to. Two cases were heard in the High Court of circumstances where this interim order had been granted but landlords were nonetheless able to lawfully gain the right of peaceable re-entry / seizing of goods in respect of rent arrears. The Insolvency Act 2000 accordingly introduced amendments aiming to prevent this type of intervention and accordingly promote the negotiation phase instead. == Insolvency options for sole traders == === Voluntary arrangements === It may be possible to continue to trade by negotiating with creditors to gain more flexible payment arrangements.Third Party Mediation Business Rescue This type of informal arrangement may be facilitated by a business rescue professional but will not be legally binding on creditors. By contrast, Individual Voluntary Arrangements are legally binding on all creditors providing those representing 75% of the total debt owed agree to the IVA proposal. === Bankruptcy === An individual may voluntarily petition the local Court with bankruptcy jurisdiction for a Bankruptcy Order (BO)to be made, usually by a District Judge. The petition will require a supporting statement of affairs. On the making of the BO, the Court notifies the Official Receiver (OR) and may in certain cases also appoint an Insolvency Practitioner. The OR has a dual function, to investigate the causes of financial failure and report any misconduct and to act as Trustee if no trustee is appointed by the Court.UK Insolvency Service, Bankruptcy Information A creditor may petition for an individual\u2019s bankruptcy using a prescribed series of legal steps and must be owed a minimum fixed amount of debt of at least \u00a3750.DirectGov - Bankruptcy - A Guide A County Court Judgement must be granted in their favour for that debt. The creditor must then issue a statutory demand for repayment. Should the demand fail to be settled within 21 days, the creditor has the option to proceed with a bankruptcy petition to the court. Following the issue of a bankruptcy order from either route, the individual cedes control of their assets to an Insolvency Practitioner, to be sold to raise funds towards repaying creditors.UK Insolvency Service - Creditor\u2019s Petitions Information from the Insolvency Service ==See also== *Sole Proprietorship *Insolvency ==References== Category:Insolvency law of the United Kingdom ",
