    "text": "The Ralston Building, now known as the Carrion Jewelry Center, is a historic building located in Downtown Miami. At the time of its completion in 1917, the eight story building was the tallest building in Miami, a title it held for less than one year when it was surpassed by the McAllister Hotel, built later in 1917. In 2001, it was purchased by First & First Investments, a company owned by local jeweler Juan Perez-Carrion. He purchased the building as the headquarters for Carrion Jewelry Manufacturing. Over the course of 3 years he restored the dilapidated building to its former grandeur. The building is located at 40 Northeast 1st Avenue and is now used for office space.http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&id;=carrionjewelry- miami-fl-usa&lng;= ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Miami#Timeline of tallest buildings ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Miami Category:National Register of Historic Places in Miami Category:Historic district contributing properties in Florida Category:1917 establishments in Florida Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Florida ",
