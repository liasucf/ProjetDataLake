He became the first president of CUT in Bahia state, and also served on the federation's executive, with responsibility for education. He was a leading figure in uniting many engineers' trade unions into the Interstate Federation of Engineers' Unions (FISENGE). From 1996, Oliveira served on the governing body of the International Labour Organization (ILO). In 2002, he was elected as the assistant general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, serving until 2006, when it merged into the new International Trade Union Confederation.
