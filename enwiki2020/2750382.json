It is the largest surviving parish church in the City of London and it contains more monuments than any other church in Greater London except Westminster Abbey, hence it is sometimes referred to as the \"Westminster Abbey of the City\". It was the parish church of William Shakespeare when he lived in the area in the 1590s.In Search of Shakespeare. Bishopsgate In 1608, prominent jurist Sir Alberico Gentili was buried in the church. ==History== The church of St Helen dates from the 13th century and a priory of Benedictine nuns was founded there\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p37:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 in 1210. It is unusual in that it was designed with two parallel naves, giving it a wide interior.\"London:the City Churches\u201d Pevsner,N/Bradley,S New Haven, Yale, 1998 Until the dissolution of the priory in 1538, the church was divided in two by a partition running from east to west, the northern half serving the nuns and the southern the parishioners. It is the only building from a nunnery to survive in the City of London. The priory had extensive monastic buildings; its hall was later used by the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers until its demolition in 1799. A crypt extended north from the church, under the hall. In the 17th century two Classical doorcases were added to the otherwise Gothic church. In 1874 the parish was united with that of St Martin Outwich when the latter's church was demolished, and the first incumbent of the new parish was John Bathurst Deane. St Helen's church was heavily restored by John Loughborough Pearson in 1891\u20131893, and reopened on St John the Baptist's Day in 1893 by the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple. Interior of St Helen's Bishopsgate St Helen's was one of only a few City of London churches to survive both the Great Fire of London of 1666 and the Blitz during World War II.\"The Old Churches of London\" Cobb,G: London, Batsford, 1942 In 1992 and 1993, however, the church was badly damaged by two IRA bombs that were set off nearby.\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 The roof of the building was lifted and one of the City's largest medieval stained glass windows was shattered. The church has since been fully restored although many of the older monuments within it were entirely destroyed. The architect Quinlan Terry, an enthusiast of Georgian architecture, designed the restoration along Reformation lines. The natural philosopher, architect and polymath, Robert Hooke, was buried at St Helen's Bishopsgate, but the precise location of his grave is unknown. ===Present day=== Owing to parish consolidation over the years, the parish is now named \"St Helen's Bishopsgate with St Andrew Undershaft and St Ethelburga Bishopsgate and St Martin Outwich and St Mary Axe\". The Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors are the patrons of the benefice.Details of the history of St Helen's and the other churches in this benefice (St Andrew, St Martin Outwich etc) in the 17th century can be found in Lee Gatiss, The Tragedy of 1662: The Ejection and Persecution of the Puritans. Gatiss The church was designated a Grade I-listed building on 4 January 1950. St Helen's Church is within the conservative evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women and/or female leadership. In 2017 its rector, William Taylor, was one of a few British figures among the initial signatories of the traditionalist Nashville Statement on sexuality and gender roles. ====Church plants==== St Helen's has been involved in numerous church planting initiatives in recent years, some within the auspices of the Church of England, some outside of it. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Location !Web !Type !Affiliation !Founded !Minister !Notes |- |Christ Church, Mayfair |Mayfair | |Church |Diocese of London |2001 |Matt Fuller |Also a Co-Mission church |- |St Peter's Barge |Canary Wharf | |Church |Diocese of London |2003 |Marcus Nodder |Britain's only church on a boat |- |Grace Church Dulwich |Dulwich | |Church |Diocese of London |2005 |Simon Dowdy |Meet in a local primary school |- |Grace Church Wanstead |Wanstead | |Church |Independent |2006 |David Gibbs |Joint plant with Christ Church Leyton.
