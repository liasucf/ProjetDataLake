Fossils have been found in Europe, the United States, and Canada.Paleobiology Database ==Description== Palaeophonus was virtually identical to modern scorpions. It grew to a lengths of .G. A. Polis The Biology of scorpions These animals did not have eyes and therefore they were blind. The Eurypterida of New York Volume 1.pdf/408 Until a few decades ago, Palaeophonus, similarly to many other scorpions of the Silurian, was thought to be one of the earliest animals to have conquered the land. In fact, a closer examination of the fossils has determined that these animals possess well-developed gills, very similar to those of contemporary eurypterids (sea scorpions).Alexander Petrunkevitch Paleozoic and Mesozoic Arachnida of Europe ==Species== Restoration of dorsal side of P. nuncius Species within this genus include: *\u2020P. arctus Matthew 1894 *\u2020P. lightbodyi Kjellesvig-Waering 1954 *\u2020P. nuncius Thorell and Lindstr\u00f6m 1884 *\u2020P. osborni Whitfield 1885 ==References== * *Frank H.T.
