Early settlers to the region translated this into \"Whetstone River\". In 1833, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation intending to restore the original Native American names to some Ohio waterways, but mistakenly gave Whetstone River the name \"Olentangy\"--Delaware for \"river of the red face paint\"--which had actually belonged to what is now known as Big Darby Creek. Lane Avenue Bridge in Columbus, Ohio, near The Ohio State University campus ==Geography== The Olentangy River rises in Morrow County approximately 2 mi (3.2 km) southeast of Galion, near Blooming Grove, flowing through Galion and northwest towards Bucyrus, where it then turns south and flows through Eastern Marion County, Ohio (where it is still locally known as the Whetstone River) before flowing south into Delaware County. The river continues southward towards the communities of Delaware, Powell, Worthington, and the village of Riverlea, before reaching Columbus and the campus of Ohio State University, before joining with the Scioto River in downtown Columbus. The Delaware State Park Reservoir, also known as Delaware Lake, was constructed along the Olentangy River in 1951. The reservoir is located 5 miles north of the city of Delaware, and was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control purposes. On January 13, 2005, Delaware Dam was nearly overtopped. The water level came within less than 1 foot of the top of the dam, requiring the main spill gates to be opened before it began dropping. The Olentangy River is the primary source of drinking water for much of Delaware County. Both the City of Delaware and Del-Co Water Company, the supplier of drinking water to most of rural Delaware County (and other communities beyond), draw the majority of their water supplies from the Olentangy system. Twenty-two miles of the Olentangy have been designated a State Scenic River by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas & Preserves. ==Variant names== The Olentangy River has also been known as Keenhongsheconsepung, Oleutangy, Whetstone Creek, Whetstone River, and Whitestone Creek. == River restoration== In 2012 the Ohio EPA and the City of Columbus began to remove some of the lowhead dams that cross the river. Work started with removing the 5th Avenue Dam. The river is now about half of its former width. Work continues to restore the banks and clean the area.http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/35/nps/319DOCS/OlentangyRiverSuccess2010.pdf ==Popular culture== Broadcaster Keith Jackson would introduce Ohio State football games \"from the banks of the mighty Olentangy.\" ==See also== *List of rivers of Ohio == References == ==External links== * Olentangy Watershed Alliance * Friends of the Lower Olentangy Watershed * Delaware Dam level and outflow graph * Olentangy River Level Gauge at Worthington, OH Category:Rivers of Ohio Category:Rivers of Delaware County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Crawford County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Franklin County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Columbus, Ohio ",
