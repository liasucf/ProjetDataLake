He is a yak\u1e63a and regarded as a Wisdom King in esoteric tradition. ==Origin Story== ===Introduction=== The Pali Canon provides the story of \u0100\u1e6davaka as follows: At the time of the Buddha, \u0100\u1e6davaka was a man-eating yak\u1e63a that lived deep in the forest of \u0100\u1e6davI. One day, the king of \u0100\u1e6dav\u012b was hunting in the forest. On his way back to the palace, he passed under a large banyan tree where \u0100\u1e6davaka dwelt. The yak\u1e63a was granted permission by King Vai\u015brava\u1e47a that he could seize and devour anyone who came within the shadow of his abode. In exchange for his life, the king, along with his ministers and the mayor Nagaraguttika, made a promise to provide the demon with the bodies of captured criminals as food. Of \u0100\u1e6davaka's many powers, one was that a glance at him could make one's body as soft as butter. It eventually came to pass that due to a shortage of criminals, each household in the vicinity was forced to sacrifice one child to satiate the demon. Pregnant women fled the capital until twelve years later, the only child left was the king's own son \u0100\u1e6davaka Kum\u0101ra. The king dressed his son for the occasion of sacrifice. The Buddha, using his power of clairvoyance, saw the potential outcome of the situation and hastened to the yak\u1e63a's lair. ===Confrontation=== While \u0100\u1e6davaka was away with an assembly of yak\u1e63as in the Himalayas, the Buddha was greeted by his doorkeeper Gadrabha. Gadrabha warned the Buddha of the demon's wrathful nature, but the Buddha fearlessly entered \u0100\u1e6davaka's abode and sat upon his throne. Gadrabha traveled to the Himalayas to inform \u0100\u1e6davaka what had happened. Meanwhile, the Buddha was teaching Dharma to \u0100\u1e6davaka's womenfolk. The yak\u1e63as \u015aatagiri and Haimavata were also on their way to the assembly in the Himalayas and became aware of the Buddha's presence by their inability to fly directly over him. They flew down to venerate the Buddha before continuing on their journey. When \u0100\u1e6davaka heard from Gadrabha, \u015aatagiri and Haimavata of the Buddha's presence, he placed his left foot on Manosil\u0101tala and his right foot on Kel\u0101sak\u016bta, both localities in the Himalayas, which suggests that the yak\u1e63a grew to an enormous size. He cried out his name aloud and hurried back to his palace. Despite his various supernormal powers, he was unsuccessful as dislodging the Buddha from his throne. Even his ultimate weapon; the cloth Duss\u0101vudha, one of the four most powerful weapons in the world; was of no effect. When he hurled it, it simply fell at the Buddha's feet as a rug. ===\u0100\u1e6davaka's Questions=== \u0100\u1e6davaka finally asked the Buddha to leave. The Buddha complied. The demon then summoned him to return, which the Buddha did. To and fro the Buddha went at \u0100\u1e6davaka's command until the fourth time, when the Buddha refused to obey. \u0100\u1e6davaka's proposed a set of questions to the Buddha, claiming that if he was unable to answer, he would possess his mind, rip out his heart, or hurl him by the feet across the Ganges river. Although there are a total of thirteen questions, they are usually grouped together as eight. In question and answer format, these are as follows: :1) What is a person\u2019s highest wealth? Conviction is a person\u2019s highest wealth. :2) What when well-practiced, brings bliss? Dharma, when well-practiced, brings bliss. :3) What is the highest of savors? Truth is the highest of savors. :4) Living in what way is one\u2019s life called the best? Living with discernment, one\u2019s life is called best. :5) How does one cross over the flood? Through conviction one crosses over the flood. :6) How does one cross over the sea? Through heedfulness, one crosses over the sea. :7) How does one overcome suffering & stress? Through persistence one overcomes suffering & stress. :8) How is a person purified? Through discernment a person is purified. :9) How does one gain discernment? Convinced of the arhats\u2019 Dharma for attaining unbinding,\u2014heedful, observant\u2014one listening well gains discernment. :10) How does one find wealth? Doing what\u2019s fitting, enduring burdens, one with initiative finds wealth. :11) How does one attain honor? Through truth one attains honor. :12) How does one bind friends to oneself? Giving binds friends to oneself. :13) Passing from this world to the next world, how does one not grieve? Endowed with these four qualities,\u2014truth, self-control, stamina, relinquishment (c\u0101ga)\u2014a householder of conviction, on passing away, doesn\u2019t grieve. ===Conversion=== After his questions were answered, the yak\u1e63a, amazed at the Buddha's wisdom and righteousness, became a \u015brot\u0101panna. The Commentary (SnA.i.228) states that \u0100\u1e6davaka's parents had prepared these questions and their answers from K\u0101\u015byapa Buddha and taught them to their son. He had them written on a gold leaf with red paint to be stored in his palace. The answers the Buddha gave were identical to those given by K\u0101\u015byapa Buddha. At dawn, the king's men arrived with the young prince prepared for sacrifice as food for \u0100\u1e6davaka. They hear the yak\u1e63a shout with joy upon hearing the Buddha's teachings. When they offered the boy to the demon who in turn handed him over to the Buddha. The Buddha blessed the boy and handed him back to the king's men. This boy was then known as Hastaka \u0100\u1e6davaka, who became one of the foremost lay disciples of the Buddha. Upon learning of the demon's conversion, the king and the citizens of \u0100\u1e6dav\u012b built for him a special residence near that of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a, where they provided him with gifts of flowers, scents, and more. ==Mah\u0101y\u0101na== The Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition recognizes \u0100\u1e6davaka as a Wisdom King and one of the Eight Great Yak\u1e63a Generals of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a. A common title is \u0100\u1e6davaka Mah\u0101yak\u1e63asen\u0101pati (Sanskrit; lit. \u201cGreat Yak\u1e63a General \u0100\u1e6davaka\u201d). In East Asia, he is commonly known as \u5927\u5143\u5e25\u660e\u738b (Chinese:D\u00e0yu\u00e1nshu\u00e0i M\u00edngw\u00e1ng; Japanese: Daigensui My\u014d\u014d; lit. \"Generalissimo Wisdom King\"), though many other names and translations exist. Images of \u0100\u1e6davaka vary, but he is commonly depicted with one head and four arms, four heads and eight arms, six heads and eight arms, eighteen heads and thirty six arms, etc. He is often blue, black or red in color and wields a sword, vajra, and other items. He has a countenance of wrath and a body enveloped by flame, which is common to other Wisdom Kings. He is sometimes seen with N\u0101gas encircling his arms and legs. ===Japan=== Daigensui My\u014d\u014d (Akishinodera) Daigensui My\u014d\u014d is venerated as a protector of the nation from foreign enemies as well as natural disasters. In ancient times, the Japanese Imperial Court held a ceremony from the eighth to fourteenth days of the first month called Daigensui no h\u014d (\u5927\u5143\u5e25\u306e\u6cd5; lit. Law of \u0100\u1e6davaka) to ward off calamities. ====Temples==== Below is a non-exhaustive list of temples and shrines at which Daigensui My\u014d\u014d is enshrined: *Akishino- dera (\u79cb\u7be0\u5bfa) in Nara Prefecture *Daigo-ji (\u7406\u6027\u9662: A sub-temple of Daigo-ji) in Ky\u014dto *Daigen-do\u014d (\u592a\u5143\u5802) at T\u014d-ji (\u6771\u5bfa) in Ky\u014dto *Ky\u014dzen-ji (\u4eac\u5584\u5bfa) in \u014csaka *Jik\u014d-in (\u6148\u5149\u9662) in Fuji Prefecture *Tamura Jinja (\u7530\u6751\u795e\u793e) in Fukushima Prefecture ===Mantra and Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b=== Several esoteric practices fall under \u0100\u1e6davaka's jurisdiction and include several mantras and dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs.

His weapon, the Duss\u0101vudha, is also known as one of the four most powerful weapons in the world. The others are *\u015aakra's Vajra *Vai\u015brava\u1e47a's Gad\u0101vudha *Yama's Nayan\u0101vudha He is also listed among the yak\u1e63as in the At\u0101n\u0101tiya Sutta to be called upon by Buddhists for protection. ==Literary motif== Professor Kaigyoku Watanabe has identified the story of \u0100\u1e6davaka as among the class of Kalm\u0101sap\u0101da stories, in which three main themes are central: :1) A man-eating yak\u1e63a :2) A king who saves himself by offering a boon to the yak\u1e63a :3) The conversion of the yak\u1e63a ==Further reading== * * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Yakshas Category:Wisdom Kings Category:Dharmapalas ",
