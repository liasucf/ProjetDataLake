    "text": "Russia has competed at the Paralympic Games as different nations in its history. The nation competed as part of the Soviet Union at the 1988 Summer and Winter Games, while after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. The nation competed for a first time as Russia at the 1994 Winter Paralympics and since then they participated in every summer and winter edition up until the 2014 Winter Paralympics. == Olympic doping ban == On 7 August 2016, the Russian Paralympic Committee was banned from participating in the 2016 Summer Paralympics and possibly the 2018 Winter Paralympics due to the doping scandal in Russia. The decision to ban the entire Russian team contrasts the treatment of the Russian Olympic team during the 2016 Summer Olympics, whose members could compete if they were allowed by their sport's respective governing body. ==Medal tables== ===Medals by Summer Games=== ===Medals by Winter Games=== ===Medals by summer sport=== ===Medals by winter sport=== ==See also== * Russian Paralympic Committee * Russia at the Olympics ==References== ",
