Since the 1914 election, Jefferson County had been separated from Crook County and Deschutes County was in the process of being created. While these changed did not alter the boundaries of District 21, it did add two new counties to the district. After Forbes announced his decision to run for a third term, newspapers began speculating that he may also run for Speaker of the House.\"May Try for Speakership\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, January 30, 1916, p. 6.\"Shipworth Runs Again\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, March 23, 1916, p. 5.\"Survey of Seeker on the Legislative Ticket is Submitted\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, May 28, 1916, p. 5.\"Issue Forced on New County\", Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, January 8, 1917, p. 1.

Between the 1916 general election in November and the opening of the 1917 legislative session, Deschutes County was officially separated from Crook County. This created a minor issue when Forbes and Burdick were due to be seated in the House chamber and the printed name cards at their desks, which included the counties they represented, did not show Deschutes County.

He cited his expanding law practice as his rationale for leaving the legislature.\"Forbes will Not be a Candidate this Year\", Evening Herald, Klamath Falls, Oregon, April 17, 1918, p. 3. While the regular 1917 legislative session was over, Forbes continued to serve out his two-year term, which lasted through the end of 1918.
