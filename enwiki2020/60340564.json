    "text": "In Canadian folklore, Seelkee (transcribed in English from Halqemeylem, the local indigenous language) is a lake monster reported to have lived in the swamps of what is now Chilliwack, in British Columbia, Canada. Seelkee has been allegedly seen by the St\u00f3:l\u014d, First Nations, people for hundreds of years. The most common description of Seelkee is a 10 to 15-foot-long () sea serpent like beast with the head of a horse. Most descriptions talk about how the creature was snake-like with two heads. Mostly black the serpent had red circular designs. The primary summer shelters for the St\u00f3:l\u014d people was in the form of a longhouse. Although some modern longhouses were built with gabled roofs, most St\u00f3:l\u014d longhouses were built with a single flat, but slanted roof, similar to the X\u00e1:ytem Longhouse. Entire extended families would live in a longhouse, and the structure could be extended as the family expanded. Some of the longhouses in the local St\u00f3:l\u014d villages were defined by large house posts with Seelkee designs accented with red paint. One of the first Caucasian settlers of the region, Issac Kipp, reportly saw a Seelkee and spoke how he was told by the local Sto:lo people never to turn your back on the beast. Saying \"Don't turn around, if you do you'll be sick.\" ==See also== * Igopogo, said to live in Lake Simcoe, Ontario * Loch Ness Monster * Ogopogo, said to live in Okanagan Lake, BC * Memphre, said to live in Lake Memphremagog, Quebec * List of reported lake monsters * Selkie, a similar named creature ==Bibliography== Notes References * \\- Total pages: 208 * \\- Total pages: 722 * \\- Total pages: 226 * \\- Total pages: 42 Category:Culture of British Columbia Category:Canadian folklore Category:First Nations in British Columbia SEelkee Category:Canadian legendary creatures Category:Legendary creatures of the indigenous peoples of North America ",
