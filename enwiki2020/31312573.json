The event is a five-day festival, including one shore day at a select Caribbean destination. ==History== The first 70000 Tons of Metal was held in 2011, and until 2014, 70000 Tons of Metal took place on board the cruise liner Majesty of the Seas. In 2015, the festival moved to the cruise liner Liberty of the Seas and then to Independence of the Seas in 2016. From 2011 to 2014, the festival took place between Monday and Friday, and then from Thursday to Monday beginning in 2015. From 2011 to 2014, the cruise departed from PortMiami in Miami, Florida. Since 2015 the cruise departs from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The cruise sails to varying Caribbean tourist destinations and back. On each voyage, from 2011 to 2014 there were 40+ metal bands on board, each performing twice. From 2015 onward, there have been 60+ bands from different metal genres performing on board, also each performing twice. (With the exception of Swallow the Sun performing three shows on board in 2018.http://bravewords.com/news/benediction-swallow-the-sun-added-to-lineup- for-70000-tons-of-metal-2018) Since 2011, there have been between 3500 and 5500 people on board each year, including the ship's crew. In August 2011, the organizers of 70000 Tons of Metal announced an additional festival on a cruise ship, named \"Barge to Hell\", scheduled for December 3 to 7, 2012. Unlike the 70000 Tons of Metal cruises, Barge to Hell was only booked to approximately 60% capacity. The route went from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas. The musical focus was on extreme metal genres like thrash, death and black metal. == Background == Swiss concert promoter Andy Piller is the initiator and organizer of 70000 Tons of Metal. As a young adult, he began to organize concerts in his hometown of Flums, Switzerland, which later became his profession. Piller had the idea to hold a metal festival on a ship in 2006, when he observed passing cruise ships from his balcony. In the approximately four-year preparatory phase Piller went on several regular cruises, found investors who supported the project with grants in the millions and founded the company Ultimate Music Cruises, of which he is managing director (CEO). There was a rumor in 2010 that 70000 Tons of Metal was planned to take place only once. Piller denied this when talking to German Stern magazine: Piller also added that \"There will be a next edition and almost certainly many more afterwards.\" == Line-up and stage situation == Up to 60 bands from all genres of heavy metal perform at each edition of the festival. The main stage on the Majesty of the Seas was situated in the ship's theater \"A Chorus Line\" on Decks 5\u20137. On Deck 8 there was a smaller stage in the \"Spectrum\" lounge and on Deck 12 there was the open air \"Pool Deck stage\". For the Pool Deck stage, a separate pool was drained and covered to make room for the audience. Since 2012, the Pool Deck stage has become much larger and more professional. Since 2015, the festival has had four stages: the pool deck stage, a stage in the ship's main theater, the Ice Rink \u201cStudio B\u201d stage, and the smallest location, the ship's show-lounge. == Accommodation and pricing == Pricing, 70000 Tons, 2012 To visit the festival, it is only necessary to book a cabin, this includes meals, non-alcoholic and non-carbonated drinks, and entry to all performances. The cheapest tickets (4-passenger cabin, deck 2) are always available for US$766 per person, the most expensive (2-passenger Grand Suite with large balcony, deck 10) are $2999 (2017), $3333 (2012 and 2013), also per person. Additional costs per passenger vary each year; these are for taxes, port fees, \"booking fees,\" nonrefundable onboard gratuities, and other administrative costs. In addition to the concerts, there are the usual amenities on board a cruise ship: a gym, a spa, a casino, several fee-included restaurants, pools, hot-tubs (some very close to the pool-deck stage), plus a basketball court, body-slides and a climbing wall for recreation. == Reception == At first the cruise company and the ship's crew were skeptical about their unusual traveling party, however due to the unexpectedly friendly and well- behaved guests and the economic success of the entire festival, their opinion changed fundamentally. In 2011, 70000 Tons of Metal received national and international press coverage. Metal Hammer magazine, Stern magazine and German TV stations RTL, NDR and ZDF featured the event. In 2012, documentaries about the festival were produced by CNN, Sat.1 and WDR. The most prestigious media to report on the cruise in 2013 were Aardschok, Blick.ch, CNN, Lingener Tagespost, Metal Hammer, Rock Hard, Spiegel Online and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Since 2013, Full Metal Cruise takes place in the Baltic Sea following a similar concept. To what extent the organizers were inspired by 70000 Tons of Metal is unclear. == 2011 == Route of 70000 Tons of Metal 2011 In 2011, the inaugural voyage of 70000 Tons of Metal set sail on January 24 from PortMiami, Miami, Florida toward Cozumel, Mexico and returned on January 28.
