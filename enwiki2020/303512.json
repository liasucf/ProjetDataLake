    "text": "Terbutaline, sold under the brand name Bricanyl among others, is a \u03b22 adrenergic receptor agonist, used as a \"reliever\" inhaler in the management of asthma symptoms and as a tocolytic (anti-contraction medication) to delay preterm labor for up to 48 hours. This time can then be used to administer steroid injections to the mother which help fetal lung maturity and reduce complications of prematurity. It should not be used to prevent preterm labor or delay labor more than 48\u201372 hours. In February 2011, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring a black box warning on the drug's label. Pregnant women should not be given injections of the drug terbutaline for the prevention of preterm labor or for long-term (beyond 48\u201372 hours) management of preterm labor, and should not be given oral terbutaline for any type of prevention or treatment of preterm labor \"due to the potential for serious internal heart problems and death.\" It was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1970. ==Medical uses== Terbutaline is used as a fast-acting bronchodilator (often used as a short-term asthma treatment) and as a tocolytic to delay premature labor. The inhaled form of terbutaline starts working within 15 minutes and can last up to 6 hours. Terbutaline as a treatment for premature labor is an off-label use not approved by the FDA. It is a pregnancy category C medication and is routinely prescribed to stop contractions. After successful intravenous tocolysis, little evidence exists that oral terbutaline is effective. However, following uterine inversion in the third stage of labor, terbutaline (or either Halothane or magnesium sulfate) can be used to relax the uterus if necessary prior to uterine replacement. ==Side effects== * Adult \u2014 tachycardia, anxiety, nervousness, tremors, headache, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypotension and, rarely, pulmonary edema. * Fetal \u2014 tachycardia and hypoglycemia., 5 Minute Consult (Original Source: UpToDate \"Terbutaline: Drug information\"). == Pharmacology== The tertiary butyl group in terbutaline makes it more selective for \u03b22 receptors. Since there is no hydroxy group on position 4 of the benzene ring, the molecule is less susceptible to metabolism by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase. ==Chemistry== Terbutaline is synthesized by brominating 3,5-dibenzyloxyacetophenone into 3,5-dibenzyloxybromoacetophenone, which is reacted with N-benzyl-N-tert-butylamine, giving a ketone intermediate. Reduction of this product with H\u2082 over Pd/C leads to terbutaline.Draco Lunds Farmacevtiska Aktiebolag, (1967)Draco Lunds Farmacevtiska Aktiebolag, (1968)L. A. Svensson, I. K.
