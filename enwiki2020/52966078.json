    "text": "As of October 2018, 16 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Tokyo. The building pictured is Yasuda Auditorium. This list of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Tokyo comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of the University of Tokyo who were awarded the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. , 16 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the University of Tokyo, and 10 of them are officially listed as \"Tokyo's Nobel Laureates\" by the university. Among the 16 laureates, 11 are Tokyo alumni (graduates and attendees), and 4 have been long-term academic members of the university faculty. Subject-wise, 7 laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, more than any other subject. ==Inclusion criteria== University of Tokyo The university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) Alumni (graduates and attendees), 2) Long-term Academic Staff, and 3) Short- term Academic Staff. Graduates are defined as those who hold Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate, or equivalent degrees from the University of Tokyo, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in a degree program at Tokyo but did not complete the program; thus, honorary degrees, posthumous degrees, summer attendees, exchange students, and auditing students are excluded. The category of \"Long-term Academic Staff\" consists of tenure/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of \"Short-term Academic Staff\" consists of lecturers (without tenure), postdoctoral researchers (postdocs), visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At University of Tokyo, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a laureate. Further explanations on \"visitors\" under \"Short-term Academic Staff\" are presented as follows. 1) All informal or personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award/honor-based visiting positions, to minimize controversy this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the laureates were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the laureates specifically classified the visiting positions as \"affiliation\" or similar in reliable sources such as their curriculum vita. In particular, attending meetings and giving public lectures, talks or non-curricular seminars at University of Tokyo is not a form of employment-level duty. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Nobel-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years. == Nobel laureates by category == === Nobel laureates in Physics === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\" |- !
