Their home ground is Grant Street Park in the city's Merkinch area.Clachnacuddin: The fire-hit football club longing to return home, BBC Scotland News, 31 January 2020 They also have a youth system, with many teams ranging from the primary squads to the under 19s. The club operated a reserve team in the North Caledonian Football League but withdrew for the start of the 2014\u201315 season. They were founded in 1885 and are nicknamed \"The Lilywhites\" (due to their white strip) or \"Clach\". Their name is an English approximation of a Scots Gaelic name meaning \"the stone of the tub\", referring to a city landmark in Inverness. As a senior team with a compliant stadium, they are entitled to enter the Scottish Cup. ==Grant Street Park== Clachnacuddin have played at Grant Street Park in the Merkinch area of Inverness since the ground opened in 1886. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 3,000 spectators. On 23 May 1988 a major fire destroyed Grant Street\u2019s wooden grandstand with vandalism blamed. On the morning of Christmas Eve 2019, a fire broke out in the kit room due to an electrical fault in a tumble drier. As a result, Clachnacuddin's home game against Formartine United was called off. Following this incident, Clach were put into a temporary groundshare with Highland RFC at Canal Park, in the Bught area of Inverness.
