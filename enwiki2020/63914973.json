After compiling a record of 5\u20130 (1 KO), she faced Ellen Simwaka for the inaugural Commonwealth female bantamweight title on 24 November 2018 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel. Fraser knocked her opponent down in the fourth round en route to a fifth-round stoppage victory via corner retirement (RTD) after Simwaka's corner pulled her out of the fight at the end of the fifth. With the win, Fraser became Scotland's first female to win a Commonwealth title. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Ellen Simwaka | |5 (10), |24 Nov 2018 |align=left| |align=left| |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Roz Mari Silyanova | |7 (8), |6 Oct 2018 |align=left| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Dominika Novotna |PTS |6 |1 Sep 2018 |align=left| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Claire Ciantar |PTS |6 |24 Feb 2018 |align=left| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Gabriella Mezei |PTS |4 |9 Jun 2017 |align=left| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Lana Cooper | |6 |31 Mar 2017 |align=left| | |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1988 births Category:British women boxers Category:Sportspeople from Aberdeen Category:Bantamweight boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:Commonwealth Boxing Council champions ",
