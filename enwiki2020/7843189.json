    "text": "Loter\u00eda Cantada is a 2006 DVD featuring the Mexican-American singer Lila Downs in a series of concerts held in Mexico City and Oaxaca City, Mexico, in February 2006. The DVD is the result of a collaboration by a number of film makers working with Downs and her band. According to Down's web site, \"Images were edited and intervened by nine visual artists: Ivonne Fuentes, Bruno Varela, Alejandro Cant\u00fa, Pedro Jim\u00e9nez, Mario Viveros, Sal V. Ricalde, Fernando Llanos, Johnny Moreno and Elena Pardo.\" The performances were benefit concerts for the Guadalupe Musalem Scholarship Fund. The music features original works and traditional Mexican songs that Downs has featured on her recordings. Included are Downs' take on \"La Cucaracha\" and her reading of the story of \"La Llorona\". Extra features include an \"on the road\" video of Downs and her band on tour, and an experimental video done by Downs' father, Allen Downs. Her filmmaker father died when Downs was young so his video features Lila as a toddler with her mother in the Mixteca Alta of Oaxaca. The DVD features subtitles. == Track list == # El Pescador # Dignificada # One Blood # Cucaracha # Hanal Weech (cumbia Maya) # Naila # Mother Jones # La Iguana # Malinche # La Llorona # Paloma Negra # Viborita (Concierto callejero en Oaxaca) == Extras == * \"La Cumbia del Mole\" ( video clip, directed by Johnny Moreno) * Love Shots (short film by Allen Downs, Lila father, 1974) * En el Camino/ On the Road (documentary by Elena Pardo) * Lila + Pintores de Oaxaca (conversations with Oaxacan painters: Guillermo Olguin, Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda y Luis Z\u00e1rate) * Lila + Cortometrajes (short films) ...and more. ==External links== * Lila Downs, official web site Category:Mexican music television series Category:Lila Downs video albums ",
