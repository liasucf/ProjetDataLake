    "text": "The Thermales-rpoB RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure that was discovered by bioinformatics. Thermales-rpoB motifs are found in Thermales. Thermales- rpoB motif RNAs likely function as cis-regulatory elements, in view of their positions upstream of protein-coding genes, which invariably encode subunits of RNA polymerase. Such genes are also believed to be regulated by the Rhodo- rpoB RNA motif, although these two motifs occur in quite diverged lineages of bacteria. ==References== Category:Cis-regulatory RNA elements regulating RNA polymerase genes Category:Non-coding RNA ",
