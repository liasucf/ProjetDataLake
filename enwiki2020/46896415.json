Written despite the official attitude of the Soviet Union that all its citizens were Soviets, rather than the individual nationalities, the lyric makes the singer's contrary position very clear. Linna sings \"I am Estonian and I will remain Estonian/Because I was made Estonian/To be Estonian is a thing to be proud of/Free like my ancestors were\". The song is often performed at the Estonian Laulupidu and other patriotic events, as well as being regarded as one of Estonia's favourite songs.
