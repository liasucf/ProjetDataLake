Its business arm More Than BUSINESS offers business insurance. The company is a subsidiary of the RSA Insurance Group. The brand launched in 2001, under the slogan of \"Don't Accept Less Than More Than\".

Royal & Sun Alliance formed in 1996, following the merger of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance.https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02339826 The insurance group set aside \u00a320 million in order to create the new More Than brand. Since its inception, the company has focused on developing small service teams to care for customers in a more personal way. The company also changed the way their call centres functioned by removing scripts, thus enabling claims handlers to actually talk to customers, and encouraged call centre staff to recommend suppliers from the More Than network in order to resolve a problem. In February 2008, it was announced that their parent company, Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group, would be rebranding to RSA Insurance Group. This however had no effect on any of their subsidiaries, including More Than. In 2013, More Than updated their brand promise to 'Where You Mean More' and became an official partner of the RSPCA. By March 2015, the insurance company had donated over \u00a3260,000 to help unwanted or neglected animals in England and Wales as well as offering six weeks\u2019 free insurance to those who re home a pet from the RSPCA. The company launched SM>RT WHEELS in 2014, a telematics insurance. The product focused on the young drivers market, allowing them to make savings, by rewarding safe driving throughout the year and at their time of renewal. More Th>n announced Rob Flynn will be appointed Managing Director of the company from 1 August 2016. ==Advertising== The brand launched in 2001, with a campaign featuring Lucky the Dog. Lucky went on to star in more than twenty adverts. The campaign, produced by Ogilvy & Mather, called Where's Lucky? The ads looked like an appeal for information about a lost dog, with the aim of directing people to the website, WheresLucky.com. The advertising campaign, at drawing interest to the newly formed More Than brand. The success of early adverts, one of the first featured \"Lucky\" driving his owner\u2019s car home without crashing it, led the brand to continue using Lucky for another five years. During this five year period, the company used the slogan, More Than Lucky. In March 2002, More Than announced their new ad agency would be Camp Chipperfield Hill Murray (CCHM). In March 2006, More Than aired their first television advert without Lucky, and the new slogan More Than \u2013 We Do More. In February 2011, the insurance company launched a television advert starring Josh Robert Thompson replicating a similar voice, and speaking style to that of actor Morgan Freeman.
