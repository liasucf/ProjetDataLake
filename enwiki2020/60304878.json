It was first exhibited at Spain's National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1895, where it won third prize and thus was bought by the state for the former Museo de Arte Moderno. From there it passed to the Prado Museum in 1971 and finally to its present home in 1995 due to a royal decree which re-allocated the Prado and Museo de Arte Moderno's collectionsDo\u00f1ate, Merc\u00e8; Mendoza, Cristina: Ramon Casas.
