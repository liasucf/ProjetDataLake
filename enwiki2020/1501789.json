He then worked on the Channel 4 show, The Big Breakfast, writing for comedy puppets, Zig and Zag.

His commissioning credits include the series Bo' Selecta!, Black Books, Spaced and Bremner, Bird and Fortune. He also commissioned three series of the Comedy Lab whilst at the channel. He left the role to work on the first series of Look Around You (2002) with Peter Serafinowicz. Look Around You was a spoof educational science comedy which ran on BBC2. It was written and produced by Popper (who featured onscreen in one episode as \"Jack Morgan\" also performing the rock song \"Little Mouse\") and Serafinowicz (who appeared more frequently). The pair also wrote and played all the music in the series. Look Around You was nominated for a BAFTA and a British Comedy Award. In 2003, Popper co-wrote the short film Hello Friend with Graham Linehan. In 2005, Popper returned to the screen with a second series of Look Around You, again co-written by himself and Peter Serafinowicz. Made up of six half-hour shows, Look Around You 2 resembled an early-80s Tomorrow's World . Popper appeared in all six episodes as Jack Morgan. Besides Popper and Serafinowicz, the series featured Josie D'Arby and Olivia Colman as presenters. Look Around You 2 won the Rose D'Or TV Award in 2006 for Best Comedy Series. Popper was a programme consultant and co-writer for the TV sketch comedy The Peter Serafinowicz Show (2007), in which he also made several brief on-screen appearances.

Popper was the script editor on all three series of The Inbetweeners. He was also script editor on Graham Linehan's The IT Crowd and the BBC3 comedy Him & Her. In 2009 Popper and Serafinowicz wrote, produced and performed in a 30-minute podcast entitled The Other Side. The comedy purported to be a radio show coming from the only radio station (\"Radio Spiritworld\") to broadcast from the afterlife. Robert and Peter also created the online world religion, \"Tarvuism\", making a variety of shorts. The pair created a number of web videos on YouTube showcasing their surreal humour, including \"Birds of Britain\", \"Markets of Britain\" and \"Intermission\". Popper also wrote on the fourteenth series of South Park; he was signed up by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker following a week long brainstorming session, and worked on the final four episodes of first half-season. Popper created, wrote and produced six series of the Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner. Series 1 aired from February to April in 2011 and won the Rose D'or Award for Best Sitcom. It also received two BAFTA nominations and four British Comedy Award nominations. Popper had a small, uncredited role in Edgar Wright's 2004 film Shaun of the Dead, in which he played a news reporter, and also appeared in the Wright's next film, Hot Fuzz (2007), credited as \"Not Janine\". He reprised his Look Around You character, Jack Morgan, for an appearance in the music video for Frankie & The Heartstrings' 2011 single \"Hunger\". ==Books== Robert Popper wrote the books The Timewaster Letters and Return of the Timewaster Letters under the pseudonym Robin Cooper.

The Financial Times (FT) website published a blog post, stating its belief that the story was a hoax. The FT also reported on the emergence of a computer animated version of the events from Hong Kong.
