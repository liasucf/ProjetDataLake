    "text": "The Royal College Curepipe (commonly known as RCC), located in the centre of the town of Curepipe, Mauritius, is a state boys-only secondary school. RCC is widely referenced as one of the best all-boys high school in Mauritius. The school has high admissions standards, and is known for producing a high number of \u2018laureates\u2019 (high-performing students at A-Levels who are awarded a scholarship for foreign tertiary studies). ==History== The Royal College Curepipe is one of the oldest educational institutions of the Republic of Mauritius. The history of the Royal College Curepipe stretches back to 1791 when the predecessor of the Royal College of Curepipe, the Coll\u00e8ge National also known as the Coll\u00e8ge Colonial was founded in Port Louis. It was reserved for the children of the privileged classes of that area, and the college was known as \u00c9cole Centrale in 1800, before taking that of Lyc\u00e9e Colonial from 1803 to 1810 during the final years of the French rule in Mauritius. The Lyc\u00e9e Colonial was a boarding school and military training was introduced. For six months after the British conquest in 1810, the Lyc\u00e9e Colonial was used as a military hospital in Port Louis. In 1813 the name of the college was changed by a decree of Governor Sir Robert Farquhar, and became the Royal College. The main driver for relocating the college from Port-Louis to Curepipe was the deadly epidemic of 1899 which was most prevalent in the warmer and humid capital city. In 1912 the foundation stone of the present building in Curepipe was finally laid by Director of Public Works (Paul Le Juge de Segrais). The design was inspired by the Buckingham Palace of London. The present building was inaugurated in 1914. == Notable alumni == * Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard - Medical Practitioner, Physiologist and neurologist, Professor at Royal de France * Dayendranath Burrenchobay - Laureate, Electrical Engineer, Knight of British Empire, Permanent Secretary, Governor General * Maurice Cur\u00e9 - Laureate (1907), Medical Practitioner, Trade Unionist, founder of Mauritius Labour Party, Member of Legislative Council * W.
