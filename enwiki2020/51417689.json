In 1900, Stott was promoted to work at the District Managers' Office in York; while there, he joined the Railway Clerks' Association (RCA). His manager disapproved of this and, when Stott refused to leave the union, he was transferred to a small town.\"Obituary: William Stott\", Annual Report of the 1956 Trades Union Congress, p.312 In 1909, Stott was appointed as the full-time Assistant Secretary of the RCA, serving in this office for many years. He edited the union's Railway Service Journal for twelve years, and from 1924 headed up the union's movements department.
