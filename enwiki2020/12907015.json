    "text": "After Dark is a solo album by Dick Morrissey. Recorded the same year as the Morrissey\u2013Mullen album It's About Time, some of the musicians had been also been associated that group, but although this would appear at a superficial glance to make this a Morrissey\u2013Mullen album in all but name it is clearly not. Featuring Jim Mullen on four tracks, mostly as part of the rhythm section with only an occasional lead spot; the musical direction is quite different, with Dick Morrissey clearly in the driving seat. == Track listing == # \"I Won't Last a Day Without You\" # \"March On\" * # \"They Say It's Wonderful\" # \"Pili Pili\" # \"Way We Were\" * # \"Running out of Time\" * # \"Lou Grant\" * # \"Change Partners\" == Personnel == *Dick Morrissey \u2013 tenor saxophone *John Critchinson \u2013 piano, electric piano *Ron Mathewson \u2013 double bass *Martin Drew \u2013 drums *Barry Whitworth \u2013 trumpet on \"March On\" and \"They Say It's Wonderful\" ;Guest *Jim Mullen \u2013 guitar * ==References== Category:Morrissey\u2013Mullen albums Category:1983 albums ",
