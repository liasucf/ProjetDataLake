    "text": "Frithia pulchra, fairy elephant's feet, is a species of flowering plant in the figmarigold family Aizoaceae, endemic to Gauteng Province, South Africa (where it is classified as \u201cVulnerable\u201d by the IUCN Red List). Its natural habitat is temperate grassland with high summer rainfall. A tiny stemless succulent growing to just tall and broad, it has bulbous oblong leaves with leaf windows at the tip; and magenta and white daisy-like flowers in winter. During periods of drought it has the ability to shrink beneath the soil surface, thus avoiding excessive desiccation, but making it extremely difficult to find. It is named for Frank Frith, a Johannesburg gardener who showed specimens to N.E. Brown, a botanist at Kew Gardens, while on a visit to London, UK, in 1925. The Latin specific epithet pulchra means \u201cbeautiful\u201d. It does not survive frosts, so in temperate areas it needs to be cultivated under glass. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. ==Gallery== File:Fairy elephants feet1.JPG|Wild Frithia pulchra File:Fairy elephants feet2.JPG|F. pulchra flowering in its natural habitat File:Frithia pulchra 1.jpg|University of California Botanical Garden ==References== ==Sources== * Pfab, M.F. & Victor, J. 2003.
