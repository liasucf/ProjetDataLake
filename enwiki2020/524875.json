    "text": "A voiced postalveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. This refers to a class of sounds, not a single sound. There are several types with significant perceptual differences: *The voiced palato- alveolar fricative *The voiced postalveolar non-sibilant fricative *The voiced retroflex fricative *The voiced alveolo-palatal fricative This article discusses the first two. International Phonetic Association uses term voiced postalveolar fricative only for sound . ==Voiced palato-alveolar fricative== The voiced palato-alveolar fricative or voiced domed postalveolar fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. ===Transcription=== The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is the lower case form of the letter Ezh (), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `Z`. An alternative symbol used in some older and American linguistic literature is , a z with a caron. In some transcriptions of alphabets such as the Cyrillic, the sound is represented by the digraph zh. palato-alveolar fricative Although present in English, the sound is not represented by a specific letter or digraph, but is formed by yod-coalescence of and in words such as measure. It also appears in some loanwords, mainly from French (thus written with and ). The sound occurs in many languages and, as in English and French, may have simultaneous lip rounding (), although this is rarely indicated in transcription. ===Features=== Features of the voiced palato-alveolar fricative: ===Occurrence=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !!

As the International Phonetic Alphabet does not have separate symbols for the post-alveolar consonants (the same symbol is used for all coronal places of articulation that aren't palatalized), this sound is usually transcribed (retracted constricted ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `r\\_-_r`. ===Features=== However, it does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a sibilant. * Its place of articulation is postalveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue behind the alveolar ridge. ===Occurrence=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
