In 1957, Purdy and his wife Eurithe moved to Roblin Lake in Ameliasburgh, Ontario (southeast of Trenton, in Prince Edward County), where they built an A-frame cottage, and this became his preferred location for writing.The A-Frame In his later years, he divided his time between North Saanich, British Columbia, and his cottage at Roblin Lake. In addition to his poems and novel, Purdy's work includes two volumes of memoirs, the most recent of which was Reaching for the Beaufort Sea. He also wrote four books of correspondence, including Margaret Laurence - Al Purdy: A Friendship in Letters and radio and television plays for the CBC. He was writer-in-residence at several Canadian universities; contributed to Acta Victoriana, literary journal of Victoria College;http://actavictoriana.ca and edited a number of anthologies of poetry. He wrote the introduction to the last book of poetry by his friend Milton Acorn, The Whiskey Jack. Purdy was also a long-time friend of American author Charles Bukowski. Bukowski once said: \"I don't know of any good living poets. But there's this tough son of a bitch up in Canada that walks the line.\" However, acclaim is not universal. Noted Canadian formalist poet James Pollock, when asked to \"Name one poet, living or dead, it seems everyone loves but you,\" answered: \"In Canada, Al Purdy. The emperor has no clothes.\"Medley, Mark (May 13, 2013). The Griffin Prize Q&A;: James Pollock . The National Post. Retrieved on: May 13, 2013. Al Purdy died in North Saanich.
