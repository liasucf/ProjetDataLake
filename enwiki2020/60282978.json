    "text": "The Kingdom Choir is a British gospel choir based in London. It was founded by choir conductor and workshop leader Karen Gibson. After performing for more than 20 years, the choir became world-famous after being invited to perform at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. On 19 May 2018, they sang a gospel version of \"Stand by Me\" by Ben E. King. The conductor, Gibson, was described by the British press as \"Britain's godmother of gospel\". Their performance of the song topped the U.S. Hot Gospel Songs chart. After the performance, the choir signed a record deal with Sony Music. On 26 October 2018, the choir released its debut album, Stand by Me, subtitled 15 Songs of Love and Inspiration. It contains 14 cover performances and one original piece called \"Chases\". The choir was selected to perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before the first game of the 2019 MLB London Series in June 2019. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title and details ! scope=\"col\"| Notes |- ! scope=\"row\"| Stand by Me *Type: Album *Released: 2018 *Record Label: Sony Music | |} ===Singles=== *2018: \"Stand by Me\" ==References== ==External links== *Facebook Category:English choirs Category:London choirs ",
