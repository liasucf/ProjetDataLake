    "text": "We All Have Demons is the debut studio album by American metalcore band The Color Morale. It was released on September 1, 2009 through Rise Records and was produced by Joey Sturgis. A music video was released for the single \"Humannequin\". ==Critical reception== The album received mostly positive reviews, but also mixed reviews from several critics. JesusFreakHideout rated the album 4 out of 5 and stated: \"At the end of this 34-minute album, you realize The Color Morale does it better than most in the genre. There's nothing unique here, but it's more excellent than you would expect from a fairly young band. Their sound is more mature than their age. If you like Underoath, Gwen Stacy, or A Bullet For Pretty Boy, than this one could be your next favorite.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from AllMusic.
