    "text": "The Communion of Churches in India (CCI) has been constituted as the visible organ for the joint expression of the life and witness by its constituent Churches, the Church of North India (CNI), the Church of South India (CSI) and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (MTC), who consider themselves to be part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Jesus Christ in India; even while maintaining each Church's autonomy and traditions. These three Churches are in full communion communion with one another. They also mutually recognize and accept each other's clergy, interpretation of the Bible, creeds, baptism, eucharist and ministry. \u201cThe Communion\u201d invites other Churches in India to enter into full communion with the member Churches. ==Formation and history== The origins of CCI goes back to the independent internal Theological Commissions appointed by the Church of North India, the Church of South India and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church to explore ways and means to enhance cooperation amongst them and bear Christian witness, in India. This idea of the independent commissions was originally proposed by the Church of North India and accepted by the Church of South India and the Mar Thoma Church. The independent Theological Commissions later decided to work together as a Joint Theological Commission. The first meeting of the Joint Theological Commission was held in January 1975 at Madras, which discussed the questions on faith, orders etc. The Commission also explored the possibilities of manifesting the unity of the three Churches, in the ultimate fulfillment of the \"Mission of the Christian Church\", in India. During their third meeting in September 1976, the Joint Theological Commission passed the proposal for a new model of union for these three Churches, which was accepted and a new Joint Council was inaugurated in July 1978, at Nagpur. One of the recommendations of the Joint Council was a common name, under which the three Churches will function together. This question was discussed by the different Churches. The CSI suggested the name \"Church of India\". The CNI and the MTC did not accept it, as a new Church did not come into existence. The MTC came up with \"The Council of Churches in Communion - C.N.I., C.S.I., M.T.C.\", in order to express clearly the bond of unity realized by the full communion between these Churches. The Joint Council did not accept that, either. During the Joint Council meeting held at Charalkunnu, Kerala in November 1999, the name 'Communion of Churches in India' was unanimously recommended by all three denominations, to reflect their growth in unity, over the years. The new name was adopted and announced at the Joint Council Meeting held in Calcutta in November 2000. ==Purpose== The CCI: * Aims to serve as a common organ for visible manifestation of unity, witness and service. * Will assist the churches to address the issues affecting and threatening life. * Will focus on issues of peace, justice and integrity of creation. * Will explore new avenues to share and affirm God\u2019s love through diakonia. * Will seek other churches in India to consider joining this union It has also appointed three commissions to explore the ways of working together: (1) Commission on Mission to find out the possibility of opening new mission centers in different language areas of India in cooperation with one another (2) Commission on Theological matters: to study the implication of closer relationships (3) Commission on Peace and Justice: to consider national and international issues pertaining to Justice and Peace and the response of the Church to such situations. ==Administration== * Most Rev. Dharmaraj Rasalam, Moderator, CSI * Most Rev. P. C. Singh, Moderator CNI * His Grace The Most Rev. Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma, The 21st Mar Thoma and Malankara Metropolitan and the primate of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. * Rev. Dr. D. R. Sadananda, Hon.
