This cup competition should not be confused with the more regularly played Connacht Junior Cup which has effectively been the top level competition for non-League of Ireland clubs when the Senior Cup has been inactive. ==History== ===Connacht Senior League=== Between 1981 and 1982 and 1999\u20132000, when the Connacht Senior League, was active the Connacht Senior Cup featured the members of the CSL and the champions of four junior leagues based in the province \u2013 the Galway & District League, the Sligo- Leitrim League, the Mayo Association Football League and the Roscommon & District League. Junior sides did well and featured in the first ten finals, winning four of them. In later seasons there were two more junior winners but all-Connacht Senior League finals became more common. The competition ended when the Senior league ended in 2000. During this era teams from the CSL also played in a separate league cup competition known as the Connacht Senior League Challenge Cup.Connacht Sentinel @ Irish Newspaper ArchivesGalway City Tribune @ Irish Newspaper ArchivesThe Connaught Telegraph @ Irish Newspaper ArchivesGalway Advertiser Archives ===Revival=== In 2007 a second Connacht Senior Cup was launched. This featured the top two teams from the Galway & District League, the Sligo-Leitrim League, the Mayo Association Football League and the Roscommon & District League plus the Connacht teams that played in the League of Ireland. ==List of finals== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" border=\"1\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Season ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Winner ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Score ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Runners-up |\u221215B.C |- | 2009\u201310 || Salthill Devon || 7\u20130 || Ballina Town |- | 2008\u201309 || Westport United||2\u20131||Athenry |- | 2007\u201308 || Galway United||2\u20130||Mervue United |- | |- | 1999\u201300 || Mervue United || 4\u20132|| St Peters (Athlone) |- | 1998\u201399 || NUI Galway ||7\u20131|| Mervue United |- | 1997\u201398 || Mervue United|| 1\u20130|| Straide & Foxford United |- | 1996\u201397 || Renmore||1\u20130||Salthill Devon |- | 1995\u201396 || Galway United Reserves||2\u20131||UCG |- | 1994\u201395 || Mervue United||2\u20130||Galway Hibernians |- | 1993\u201394 || West United || 2\u20131|| Straide & Foxford United |- | 1992\u201393 || Mervue United||2\u20131||Ballina Town |- | 1991\u201392 || Salthill Devon || 1\u20130|| UCG |- | 1990\u201391 || Salthill Devon || 1\u20130 || Westport United |- | 1989\u201390 || Salthill Devon ||1\u20131 Salthill Devon won after 3\u20133 draw and penalties|| Calry Bohemians |- | 1988\u201389 || Calry Bohemians ||5\u20130 Replay after 1\u20131 draw|| Mervue United |- | 1987\u201388 || Calry Bohemians ||3\u20130 Replay after 1\u20131 draw|| Mervue United |- | 1986\u201387 || Galway Hibernians ||3\u20131|| Mervue United |- | 1985\u201386 || Dynamo Blues||2\u20131|| UCG |- | 1984\u201385 || Galway United Reserves||1\u20130||Castlebar Celtic |- | 1983\u201384 || Mervue United||2\u20131||Collegians |- | 1982\u201383 || Mervue United||1\u20130||Collegians |- | 1981\u201382 || Sligo Rovers Reserves ||3\u20132|| Galway Hibernians |} ===Notes=== ==References== Category:Defunct association football cup competitions in the Republic of Ireland Category:Association football cup competitions in Connacht Category:Connacht Senior League (association football) Category:1981 establishments in Ireland ",
