Its immediate precursors are \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyric acid (HMB) and \u03b2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA (MC-CoA). It can be metabolized into HMB, MC-CoA, and HMG-CoA in humans. ==Metabolic pathway== ==Notes== ==References== Category:Biomolecules Category:Metabolism Category:Thioesters of coenzyme A ",
