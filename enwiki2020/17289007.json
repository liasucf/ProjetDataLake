    "text": "Singles and full albums of original music for The Smurfs cartoon series (1981\u20131989) and the Smurfs movies have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. Worldwide, more than 10 million CD's were sold between 2005 and 2007 alone. == Music recordings == In general, there have been three eras in which Smurf music was very popular: the late 1970s, the early 1980s and the mid-1990s and later. The first successful Smurf record was The Smurf Song (originally titled Het Smurfenlied in Dutch) by Dutch singer, writer and producer Pierre Kartner, a.k.a. Father Abraham. The single, first released in November 1977, reached the #1 position in 16 countries. (While held off the top spot in the UK by \"You're The One That I Want\", the single broke a record for most consecutive weeks at number two, which was only equaled in 1991 by Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\".) Kartner subsequently recorded different versions of the song in different languages and he made an album, Father Abraham in Smurfland, which was also a success. As work on a second Smurf album stalled during 1979 due to creative differences between Mr Kartner and his Dutch record company Dureco, the latter \u2013 which owned the music rights to the Smurfs output \u2013 decided to take matter into own hands and started producing its own Smurf-related records, produced by music promoter Frans Erkelens and composer Barrie Corbett (who had a European hit in 1975 with If You Go as half of the duo Barry & Eileen). Together, they produced numerous Smurf albums, some of which coincided with the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series which was produced in the early 1980s. Again, many of these albums were released in different languages. In 1984, the album Best of Friends by The Smurfs \u2013 produced for the American market \u2013 received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. The third wave of Smurf mania occurred in the second half of the 1990s, and again it had a Dutch link. This time it was Dutch production team Cat Music who were asked by EMI Music in the Netherlands to produce a Smurf album with \"smurfed up\" versions of current hits. The first single was a new version of the 2 Unlimited hit No Limit, which went to Number One in the Netherlands in early 1995. Local branches of EMI in Europe requested their own Smurf albums (see below), all produced by Cat Music and mostly sung by local (uncredited) artists. === Czech Republic === There are some Smurf records released in Czech Republic. The first releases was released in 1988 and 1989, followed by 1996 to 2000, and again in 2011 and 2012.
