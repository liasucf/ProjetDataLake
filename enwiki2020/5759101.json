An NK Zagreb youth product, he spent most of his career in Germany. At international level, he earned two caps with the Croatia national team. ==Club career== ===NK Zagreb=== Born in Zagreb, Banovi\u0107 began to play football at NK Zagreb when he was 6 years old and subsequently spent his entire youth career with the club, eventually being added to their first team in the summer of 1997. He went on to play in the Croatian First League with the club during the following three seasons. After making 11 domestic league appearances in his first season as a professional, he went on to find his place as a regular with NK Zagreb. During the following two seasons, he made a total of 52 domestic league appearances and scored a total of nine domestic league goals for the club, eight of which came during the 1999\u20132000 season. ===Werder Bremen=== In the summer of 2000, Banovi\u0107 left NK Zagreb for a record outgoing transfer fee of DM 3.7 million (about \u20ac1.9 million) for German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. Banovi\u0107 made his Bundesliga debut in Werder Bremen's 3\u20133 draw at home to Bayer Leverkusen on 14 October 2000, coming on as a substitute for Dieter Eilts in the 58th minute. He went on to make a total of 17 Bundesliga appearances in his first season with Bremen, without scoring any goals. He eventually scored his first Bundesliga goal in his third league appearance of the 2001\u201302 season, netting the opening goal in Bremen's 2\u20131 defeat at 1. FC Kaiserslautern on 9 September 2001. It was his only goal of the season, which he once again finished with a total of 17 Bundesliga appearances on his tally. He went on to make another 15 Bundesliga appearances during the following season in 2002\u201303, scoring his second Bundesliga goal for Bremen in their 2\u20130 win at home to VfL Bochum on 8 March 2003. However, he lost his place in the first team during the 2003\u201304 season, only appearing in three Bundesliga matches that season. He did, however, score one more goal for the club's first team, netting their seventh goal in a 9\u20131 win at Ludwigsfelder FC in the first round of the German Cup. Although the club won the league that season, his contribution to the achievement was minimal, as all of his three Bundesliga appearances of the season came in the first five matches. His final appearance for Bremen's first team came in the German Cup in December 2003. Eventually finding himself relegated to the club's reserve squad, Banovi\u0107 appeared in five Regionalliga Nord matches during the spring of 2004. He scored five goals during his five appearances for the reserves, a hat-trick in a 3\u20133 draw against SC Paderborn 07 and a brace in a 4\u20132 win against SG Wattenscheid 09. ===1. FC N\u00fcrnberg=== In the summer of 2004, Banovi\u0107 left Bremen for Bundesliga rivals 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. He scored two goals in his first two Bundesliga matches for Nuremberg, converting a penalty to score the opening goal in their 3\u20131 win at 1. FC Kaiserslautern and netting the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw at home to VfB Stuttgart. He scored another goal in N\u00fcrnberg's 2\u20132 draw at home to Bayern Munich in December 2004, converting a penalty to set the final score. He made a total of 22 Bundesliga appearances for N\u00fcrnberg in his first season with the club. He went on to make another 23 league appearances during the following season in 2005\u20132006, scoring two more goals. His first goal of the season came in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Arminia Bielefeld in October 2005 and his second from a long-range free kick in a 3\u20131 win at Kaiserslautern the following month. During the same season, he also scored two goals in the first two of the club's three matches in the German Cup, before they were knocked out in the round of 16. He made a good start to the 2006\u201307 Bundesliga season with N\u00fcrnberg, assisting in all three goals for a 3\u20130 win at VfB Stuttgart in the club's opening match of the season. He started all of the club's opening three matches of the Bundesliga season, but later lost his place in the starting line-up. He did, however, continue to play regularly as a substitute until the end of the season. His final season with N\u00fcrnberg was statistically nevertheless his most successful in the Bundesliga, with a tally of five goals in 25 appearances. He also helped N\u00fcrnberg win the 2006\u201307 German Cup, making four appearances and scoring the only goal of their away match at BV Cloppenburg in the first round.

Two weeks later, he also scored one goal in Freiburg's 5\u20132 defeat at Hannover 96. ===MSV Duisburg=== By January 2011, Banovi\u0107 had lost his place in Freiburg's starting formation and was loaned to MSV Duisburg for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season. He appeared in all but one of the club's matches and scored once. At the end of the season, he returned to Freiburg. ===Energie Cottbus=== After preparing for the 2011\u201312 season with SC Freiburg, but before the season began he transferred back to the 2nd division, joining Energie Cottbus. ===Hallescher FC=== Banovi\u0107 left Cottbus at the end of the 2013\u201314 after the club were relegated from the 2.
