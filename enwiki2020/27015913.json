    "text": "Khuit I was an Egyptian queen who lived in the mid-5th Dynasty of Egypt. She was buried in mastaba D 14 at Saqqara. The Austrian Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has suggested that was the queen of pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu.W. Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: a hieroglyphic dictionary, 2005 Based on the datation of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. Proceeding by elimination, Seipel attributed known queens to each king of the period, which only leaves Menkauhor as a candidate king for her.Seipel, Wilfried (1980).

See p. 214 These arguments are criticized by the French Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.Baud, Michel (1999).

See p. 537 & 484 Another queen by the name of Meresankh IV is more commonly suggested as the wife of Menkauhor Kaiu and thus may have been a contemporary of Khuit.Joyce Tyldesley, Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt, Thames and Hudson, 2006Dodson, Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004 Khuit held the titles Great one of the hetes-sceptre (wrt-hetes), She who sees Horus and Seth (m33t-hrw-stsh), Great of Praises, King\u2019s Wife, his beloved, Attendant of the Great One, King\u2019s Daughter, and King\u2019s Wife.W.
