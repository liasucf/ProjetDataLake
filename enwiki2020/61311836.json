    "text": "Protein-truncating variants (PTVs) are genetic variants predicted to shorten the coding sequence of genes, through ways like a stop-gain mutation. PTV is sometime categorized under the umbrella term frameshift or truncating variants (FTVs), which includes both PTVs and DNA variants caused by frameshift mutation. == Implication in diseases == It was believed that protein- truncating variants are not associated with human diseases, but recent studies have implied the involvement of PTVs in diseases like the autism spectrum disorder. == References == Category:Mutation ",
