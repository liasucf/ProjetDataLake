    "text": "KotriSain is a small village in the Pauri Garhwal district of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The population of KotriSain is around 500. It covers a wide geographical area, which is hilly and a beautiful valley surrounded by Corbett Tiger Reserve. The main source of income is agriculture. The village has a primary and secondary school, which is common for many villages around. Few children attend the school because of migration of citizens to nearby towns and cities like Kotdwar and sometimes further to Delhi, which is away. Children go to Rikhnikha/Barkhet for senior schooling. There are few temples nearby: Dhontiyal, which is about from the town, and PaniSain Nausainna Devi, located about from the town. About away, there is a famous temple called Tarkeshwar Mahadev. Kotdwar is about from KotriSain. Category:Villages in Pauri Garhwal district ",
