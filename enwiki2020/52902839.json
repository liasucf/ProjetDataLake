Most of the houses were built between 1890 and 1910, with four large houses pre-dating the Civil War. For the most part, the houses here are larger in scale and include examples of Victorian and the various revival and American Movement styles from the late 19th and 20th centuries. The district is completely residential with no commercial or institutional buildings, and with only one multi-family house, a duplex. Two houses were individually listed on the National Register: Langworthy House, an Octagon house from 1855, and the Garland House (1907). The district derives its name from the Langworthy family who were early settlers in Dubuque and played a prominent role in the development of the local lead mining industry and the city itself. Three of the brothers built houses here. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Greek Revival architecture in Iowa Category:Historic districts in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
