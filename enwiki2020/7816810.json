    "text": "Marinus Dijkhuizen (born 4 January 1972, in 's-Gravenzande) is a Dutch football manager, coach and former player, who is manager of SBV Excelsior. As a player, he had notable spells in his native Netherlands with SBV Excelsior, SC Cambuur and TOP Oss. He retired in 2009 and entered management, eventually returning to SBV Excelsior as manager in 2014. ==Playing career== A forward, Dijkhuizen spent the majority of his 14-year professional career in the top two divisions of Dutch football, most notably with two spells at both SBV Excelsior and SC Cambuur. He was a part of the SC Cambuur team which secured promotion to the Eredivisie in the 1997\u201398 season and later played top-flight football with FC Utrecht. He had a loan spell with Scottish Premier League club Dunfermline Athletic during the 2000\u201301 season. He retired at the end of the 2008\u201309 season after a player-coach spell at hometown club 's-Gravenzande SC. ==Coaching career== === 's-Gravenzandse SV === In 2008, Dijkhuizen took up a coaching role at Eerste Klasse club 's-Gravenzandse SV, the club where he began his career. He left the club in 2009. === FC Utrecht === During the 2012\u201313 Eredivisie season, Dijkhuizen worked as a forward coach at former club FC Utrecht. In January 2018, he returned to the club as assistant to manager Jean-Paul de Jong and remained in the role until January 2020. ==Managerial career== === VV Montfoort === Dijkhuizen began his managerial career with Eerste Klasse Saturday club VV Montfoort in 2009. He led the club to two successive promotions in the 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311 seasons, taking the club to the Topklasse. He departed at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. === VV De Meern === Dijkhuizen signed a two-year contract with Derde Klasse Sunday club VV De Meern in January 2012. After officially starting work on 1 July 2012, he managed the club until December 2013. ===SBV Excelsior=== On 1 January 2014, Dijkhuizen was announced as manager of Eerste Divisie club SBV Excelsior on a contract running until the end of the 2013\u201314 season. He took over from Jon Dahl Tomasson, who had departed for Eredivisie club Roda JC Kerkrade. Starting out in seventh position in the table, Dijkhuizen encouraged the club to be more attacking and pushed striker Lars Veldwijk further forward. Veldwijk's 17 goals since the Dijkhuizen's arrival helped fire the Kralingers to third-place in the table and promotion to the Eredivisie, after a 4\u20132 aggregate victory over RKC Waalwijk in the playoffs. The club endured a difficult 2014\u201315 season in the top-flight, finishing one place above the relegation zone, though a new defensive style contributed to 14 draws, the most in the division. Dijkhuizen departed the club in May 2015, despite having signed a new two-year contract in December 2014. ===Brentford=== On 1 June 2015, Dijkhuizen was announced as head coach of English Championship club Brentford, replacing Mark Warburton. He installed former SC Cambuur teammate Roy Hendriksen as his assistant. Dijkhuizen had a difficult first week of the 2015\u201316 season and began the campaign with a crippling lack of players through injury and outgoing transfers, which caused disharmony amongst the club's supporters. Problems with a poor pitch at Griffin Park compounded the injury problems. After two wins, two draws and five defeats from the first 9 matches of the season, Dijkhuizen and Hendriksen parted company with Brentford on 28 September 2015. Brentford co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen later revealed that the club \"made a mistake\" in hiring Dijkhuizen and that the decision to part company \"was based on three months of training and there were some fundamental processes, in terms of getting a full football operation to work to its maximum, that weren't at the level we wanted them to be\". === NAC Breda === On 26 October 2015, Dijkhuizen was announced as head coach of Eerste Divisie club NAC Breda. He guided the club to the third round of the promotion/relegation playoffs, but lost over two legs to the promoted club Willem II. With the club struggling to compete after 18 matches of the 2016\u201317 season, Dijkhuizen was sacked on 23 December 2016. === SC Cambuur === On 9 May 2017, Dijkhuizen returned to Eerste Divisie club SC Cambuur and took up the position of head coach on a one-year contract. He was sacked on 28 November 2017, after taking just 14 points from the opening 15 matches of the 2017\u201318 season. === Return to SBV Excelsior === On 29 January 2020, Dijkhuizen returned to Eerste Divisie club SBV Excelsior on a -year contract. == Other work == From 2008 to 2012, Dijkhuizen worked as an analyst for S.B.V. Excelsior, researching and providing data on the club's upcoming opponents. == Personal life == Dijkhuizen's brother Marc is also involved in football and the pair worked together on the coaching staff at 's-Gravenzandse SV during the 2008\u201309 season. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |National Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |SC Cambuur |1998\u201399 |Eredivisie |30 |7 |4 |4 |34 |11 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |FC Utrecht |1999\u201300 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |27 |4 |5 |2 |32 |6 |- |2000\u201301 |1 |0 |0 |0 |1 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !28 !4 !5 !2 !33 !6 |- |Dunfermline Athletic (loan) |2000\u201301 |Scottish Premier League |9 |1 |4 |1 |13 |2 |- |FC Emmen (loan) |2001\u201302 |Eerste Divisie |3 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |3 |1 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |TOP Oss |2002\u201303 | rowspan=\"3\" |Eerste Divisie |32 |10 |0 |0 |32 |10 |- |2003\u201304 |17 |11 |0 |0 |17 |11 |- |2004\u201305 |34 |9 |0 |0 |34 |9 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !83 !30 !0 !0 !83 !30 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |SBV Excelsior |2005\u201306 |Eerste Divisie |33 |7 |0 |0 |33 |7 |- |2006\u201307 |Eredivisie |11 |1 |0 |0 |11 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !44 !8 !0 !0 !44 !8 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |SC Cambuur |2006\u201307 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eerste Divisie |13 |2 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |13 |2 |- |2007\u201308 |29 |5 |1 |0 |30 |5 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |SC Cambuur total !72 !14 !5 !0 !77 !14 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !239 !58 !14 !7 !253 !65 |} == Honours == === As a player === SC Cambuur * Eerste Divisie promotion playoff: 1997\u201398 SBV Excelsior * Eerste Divisie: 2005\u201306 === As a manager === VV Montfoort * Hoofdklasse third-place promotion: 2010\u201311 * Eerste Klasse third- place promotion: 2009\u201310 SBV Excelsior * Eerste Divisie playoffs: 2013\u201314 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from 's-Gravenzande Category:Association football forwards Category:Dutch footballers Category:Excelsior Maassluis players Category:SBV Excelsior players Category:SC Cambuur players Category:FC Utrecht players Category:Dunfermline Athletic F.C. players Category:FC Emmen players Category:TOP Oss players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Scotland Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Dutch football managers Category:Eredivisie managers Category:Eerste Divisie managers Category:SBV Excelsior managers Category:Brentford F.C. managers Category:NAC Breda managers Category:SC Cambuur managers Category:Dutch expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in England Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in England Category:English Football League managers ",
