    "text": "Enemy at the Door is a British television drama series made by London Weekend Television for ITV. The series was shown between 1978 and 1980 and dealt with the German occupation of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands, during the Second World War. The programme generated a certain amount of criticism in Guernsey, particularly for being obviously filmed on Jersey despite being ostensibly set on Guernsey. The series also marked the TV debut of Anthony Head as a member of the island resistance. The theme music was by Wilfred Josephs. == Plot == The islanders were chiefly represented by the respected local doctor, Philip Martel (Bernard Horsfall), who struggled to maintain the peace while the Germans were led by Major Dieter Richter (Alfred Burke), a peacetime academic who was inclined to be lenient on the Guernsey populace but whose approach was challenged by his more conventionally nasty SS counterpart Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Klaus Reinicke (Simon Cadell). Rounding out the principal German characters were Major Freidel and Oberleutnant Kluge, a former policeman still more inclined to act as a policeman rather than a soldier. Many episodes portrayed the balance of power and fragile harmony between the islanders and the German occupying forces, and how it was threatened by either resistance action or over-zealous clamping down by the Germans. A precursor to his role as Bergerac in the detective series set on Jersey, John Nettles played a police detective ordered to work for the Germans and anguished by the conflict between his duty and collaborating with the enemy. The series ended with the Germans still in occupation, and did not depict their eventual defeat. ==Broadcast== The series was re-broadcast in the UK by Talking Pictures TV from September 2020. ==Cast== * Bernard Horsfall as Dr. Philip Martel * Alfred Burke as Major Richter * Simon Cadell as Hauptsturmfuhrer Reinicke * John Malcolm as Oberleutnant Kluge * Simon Lack as Major Freidel * Richard Heffer as Peter Porteous * Helen Shingler as Helen Porteous * Antonia Pemberton as Olive Martel * Emily Richard as Clare Martel ==Episode list== ===Series One (1978)=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !No !Title !Original Airdate |- |1 |By Order of the F\u00fchrer |21 January |- |2 |The Librarian |28 January |- |3 |After the Ball |4 February |- |4 |Steel Hand from the Sea |11 February |- |5 |The Laws and Usages of War |18 February |- |6 |V for Victory |25 February |- |7 |The Polish Affaire |4 March |- |8 |Officers of the Law |11 March |- |9 |The Jerrybag |18 March |- |10 |Treason |25 March |- |11 |Pains and Penalties |1 April |- |12 |The Prussian Officer |8 April |- |13 |Judgement of Solomon |15 April |- |} ===Series Two (1980)=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !No !Title !Original Airdate |- |1 |Call of the Dead |5 January |- |2 |Reception for the General |12 January |- |3 |Angels That Soar Above |19 January |- |4 |No Quarter Given |26 January |- |5 |Committee Man |2 February |- |6 |Post Mortem |9 February |- |7 |The Raid |16 February |- |8 |Jealousy |23 February |- |9 |War Game |1 March |- |10 |The Right Blood |8 March |- |11 |From a View to a Death |15 March |- |12 |The Education of Nils Borg |22 March |- |13 |Escape |29 March |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Episode guide, DVD review, cast gallery * *British Film Institute Screen Online Category:ITV television dramas Category:World War II television drama series Category:1978 British television series debuts Category:1980 British television series endings Category:1970s British drama television series Category:1980s British drama television series Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:London Weekend Television shows Category:English-language television shows ",
