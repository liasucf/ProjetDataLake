    "text": "Valby Park () is a park in Valby, Copenhagen. It serves as the Copenhagen venue for the travelling Gr\u00f8n Koncert festival. == History == The park is situated at the site of the former Valby F\u00e6lled (\"Common\"), which was used as landfill between 1913 and 1937. It was converted to a park between 1937 and 1939, and opened to the public on September 1, 1939. Due to fuel shortages during World War II, much of the park was dug up in 1941\u201342 to search for coke, though the park was re-established and expanded during 1944\u201352. The park was officially designated as a protected area on May 3, 1966. In connection with Copenhagen being the 1996 European City of Culture, 17 circular themed gardens were established in the park. == References == == External links == * Valby Park at K\u00f8benhavnergr\u00f8n/Copenhagen Green * Valby Park at VisitCopenhagen * Valbyparken at Stay.com Category:1939 establishments in Denmark Category:Parks in Copenhagen Category:Valby ",
