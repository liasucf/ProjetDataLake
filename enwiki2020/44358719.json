He also has served as Deputy of the LV Legislature of the Mexican Congress (2006-2009) representing Michoac\u00e1n. Reyna Garc\u00eda was accused of having ties to the Knights Templar Cartel in April 2014 and was sent to prison for organized crime charges a month later. Guillermo Valencia Reyes, former mayor of Tepalcatepec, Michoac\u00e1n, tweeted on 16 June 2014, that Governor Fausto Vallejo was using Reyna Garc\u00eda as a scapegoat to protect his son, Rodrigo Vallejo Mora. Two days later Vallejo resigned. Reyna Garc\u00eda was released from prison in December 2018. He was the only politician convicted after the investigations undertaken by federal commissioner Alfredo Castillo Cervantes. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Michoac\u00e1n Category:Mexican lawyers Category:Governors of Michoac\u00e1n Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:People from Huetamo Category:21st- century Mexican politicians ",
