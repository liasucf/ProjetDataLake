    "text": "Eastern Lombard is a group of closely related dialects of Lombard, a Gallo- Italic language spoken in Lombardy, mainly in the provinces of Bergamo, Brescia and Mantua, in the area around Crema and in parts of Trentino.Bonfadini, Giovanni 1983 Il confine linguistico veneto-lombardo In: Guida ai dialetti veneti / a cura di Manlio Cortelazzo. - Padova : CLEUP, 1983. - V. 5, p. 23\u201359 Its main variants are Bergamasque and Brescian.Enciplopedia Treccani OnlineM. Forzati, Dial\u00e8t de Br\u00e8sa (dialetto Bresciano) In Italian-speaking contexts, Eastern Lombard is often generically called a \"dialect\", which is often incorrectly understood as to mean a dialect of Italian, but it is not a dialect but a language. Eastern Lombard and Italian are different languages and have only limited mutual intelligibility. Eastern Lombard does not have any official status either in Lombardy or anywhere else: the only official language in Lombardy is Italian. ==Classification== Eastern Lombard is a Romance language and belongs to the Gallo-Italic branch. Its position on the language family put in evidence that it is genetically closer to Occitan, Catalan, French, etc. than to Italian. Its substratum is Celtic. ==Geographic distribution== Eastern Lombard is primarily spoken in Eastern Lombardy (Northern Italy), in the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, in the Northern region of the province of Mantua and in the area around Crema. The varieties spoken in these regions are generally mutually intelligible for speakers of neighboring areas, but this is not always true for distant peripheral areas. For instance, an inhabitant of the alpine valleys of Bergamo can hardly be understood by a rural inhabitant of the plains of Mantua. Differences include lexical, grammatical and phonetic aspects. ==Phonology== The following notes are essentially based on the variety of Eastern Lombard spoken in Brescia. The basic principle are generally valid also for the other varieties but local discrepancies can be found. Eastern Lombard has 9 vowels and 20 consonants. ===Consonants=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Table of consonants ! colspan=2| ! Labial ! Alveolar ! Postalveolar / Palatal ! Velar |- ! colspan=2| Nasal | | | | |- ! rowspan=2| Plosive and Affricate ! voiceless | | | | |- ! voiced | | | | |- ! rowspan=2| Fricative ! voiceless | | | () | |- ! voiced | | | | |- ! colspan=2| Trill | | | | |- ! rowspan=2| Approximant ! central | | | | |- ! lateral | | | () | |} The voiced consonants , , , , , never occur at the end of a word. This phenomenon, common to other languages (including German, Catalan, Dutch, Turkish and Russian), is called final devoicing. The phoneme only occurs in loanwords, often borrowings from Italian. For example, sci\u00e0, \"to ski\" (from Italian sciare) is pronounced . The phoneme is pronounced before a consonant. This never occurs inside a word as the segment + consonant doesn't exist in Eastern Lombard. However, it does occur when appears word-finally preceding another word which begins with a consonant. For example: ::* I \u00e8 nacc vi\u00e0 = \"they have gone away\" i \u00e8 nacc a spas = \"they have gone for a leisury walk\" ::* T\u00f6cc du = \"both\", \"each of the two\" t\u00f6cc \u00f6ndes = \"all of the eleven\" The approximants and are distinct phonemes from the vocalic sounds , . This can be seen in the following examples: ::* = \"how much\" = \"brooded\" ::* = \"dish\" = \"bitten\" Locally, the alveolar fricative is replaced by the glottal fricative . This mainly happens in the prealpine valleys of the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia; thus Br\u00e8ssa (\"Brescia\") is pronounced instead of . However, even in areas where this phenomenon is the rule, there are some interesting exceptions to take in account. Words like grassie (\"thanks\") are never pronounced . At present, the most common pronunciation is but a more genuine outcome (and often preferred by aged people) would be . Other examples for this feature: *Licensi\u00e0 (\"to dismiss, to fire\") = / *Cristi\u00e0 (\"Christian\") = / *Pasi\u00f9 (\"passion\") = / ===Assimilation=== Regressive assimilation at word boundaries is common in Eastern Lombard. Assimilation can be either complete or partial. Complete assimilation occurs when two occlusive sounds fall in contact. In this case the first occlusive is completely absorbed by the second and the resulting sound has all the features of the second consonant but is notably lengthened. For example: * el ga fa _t p_ \u00e0la = * l'\u00e8 tr\u00f2 _p c_ alt (\"it's too hot\") = * el ga _t b_ ianc (\"the white cat\") = The same phenomenon occurs when an occlusive consonant precedes a nasal or a liquid consonant. For example: * en ga _t n_ \u00e9gher (\"a black cat\") = * l'\u00e8 tr\u00f2 _p m_ is = * so ch\u00e9 stra _c m_ \u00f3rt (\"I'm dead tired\")= Complete assimilation can also occur when an occlusive precedes a fricative. For example: l'\u00e8 ni _t v_ \u00e9rt = . When a sequence of nasal+occlusive falls in contact with another occlusive or a fricative, the first occlusive is completely elided and the nasal undergoes partial assimilation. In this case no lengthening occurs. For example: * el ga 'l sa _nch b_ l\u00f6 (\"he's got blue blood\")= * l'\u00e8 lo _nc f_ \u00e9s = But when an occlusive precedes , assimilation involves both consonants and the result is an affricate sound: * l'\u00e8 ni _t z_ \u00f3 \u00e8cc = * l'\u00e8 tr\u00f2 _p z_ alt (\"it's too yellow\") = The phoneme can undergo assimilation in place of articulation with a following consonant. Thus, the /n/ in and is a velar , the /n/ in and is a labiodental . Within a word, the phoneme is never transcribed before and , where is written instead. Nasal assimilation, including to , also takes place across word boundaries. For example: * e _n c_ a (\"a dog\") = * v\u00e0ghe _n f_ \u00f2 (\"hurry up\") = * l'a _n p_ as\u00e0t (\"last year\") = ===Vowels=== Eastern Lombard has 9 vocalic sounds: {| class=\"wikitable\" !IPA !! Example !! Italian !! English |- | || sich || cinque || five |- | || s\u00e9t || sete || thirst |- | || s\u00e8ch || secco || dry, arid |- | || sach || sacco || sack, bag |- | || ci\u00f3t || chiodo || nail |- | || s\u00f2ch || ciocco || stump |- | || s\u00f6t || asciutto || dry |- | || m\u00fcr || muro || wall |- | || mur || moro || mulberry |} Only three vocalic phonemes occur in unstressed final syllables: in open syllables only, and and in both open and closed syllables. Other vowels can occur in final syllables in loanwords. Locally, the phoneme is pronounced when it appears as last sound of the word in an unstressed syllable (actually slightly more close than cardinal ). For example: * l\u00fcn _a_ (\"moon\") = * seteman _a_ (\"week\") = ===Unstressed vowel system reduction and local variability=== Some vowel contrasts are eliminated in unstressed syllables. For example, in the urban Brescian variety, and no longer contrast. Thus, the word rob\u00e0 (\"to steal\") can be pronounced both and , with almost no difference noticed by speakers. In addition, a further variant is also possible, though in this case, a difference is noticed by speakers but it is considered a local variant and no loss of intelligibility results. The sounds and also no longer contrast in unstressed syllables, and therefore the word ved\u00e8l (\"calf\") can be pronounced or . However, when affected by vowel harmony (see below), the unstressed sounds /, /, and become , , and respectively. In conclusion, it is possible to say that only five contrastive vowel qualities are found in unstressed syllables: //, /, , /, (but with the not completely separated from /). Some examples: * mol\u00e0 (\"to let go, to release\") * m\u00f6l\u00e0 (\"to grind\") * mal\u00e0t (\"sick, ill\") * pel\u00e0t (\"bald\") * Mil\u00e0 (\"Milan\") The situation can differ for other Eastern Lombard varieties, however, and the rules of the unstressed vowel system vary according to the area. For example, in Franciacorta, a province of Brescia, the sounds and are regularly replaced by and in pretonic position: * mul\u00e0 instead of mol\u00e0 * Ru\u00e0t (\"Rovato\") instead of Ro\u00e0t * \u00dcspedal\u00e8t (\"Ospitaletto\") instead of \u00d6spedal\u00e8t Since in unstressed position these vocalic sounds are not contrastive, these local variants do not compromise reciprocal intelligibility. ===Vowel harmony=== Certain varieties of Eastern Lombard (mostly in Brescian area) exhibit a process of regressive vowel harmony involving the feature of vowel height. When the stress falls on a close vowel ( or ) the preceding vowels shift their height, becoming close as well ( and become , while and become ). The vowel is not affected by this process and acts as opaque vowel blocking the harmonization process. In Camuno, harmonization occurs almost only where the stressed vowel is an and not where it is an . This phenomenon affects all the words independent of the word's function. Because the diminutive and augmentative are formed with the suffixes -\u00ec and -\u00f9 (feminine -\u00ecna and -\u00f9na) respectively, this process is easily observable in nouns: * cort\u00e8l (\"knife\") ** curtil\u00ec (\"small knife\") ** curtil\u00f9 (\"big knife\") As already mentioned, the vowel acts as opaque vowel which blocks the harmonization process: * font\u00e0na (\"fountain\") ** fontan\u00ec (\"small fountain\"), _not_ funtan\u00ec * \u00f6sped\u00e0l (\"hospital\") ** \u00f6spedal\u00ec (\"small hospital\"), _not_ \u00fcspidal\u00ec But vowels that occur after the and before the stressed vowel are still affected: * mortad\u00e8la (\"mortadella\") ** mortadil\u00ecna (\"small mortadella\") In these cases variants like funtan\u00ec and \u00fcspedal\u00ec (but not \u00fcspidal\u00ec) or murtadil\u00ecna are accepted (or locally preferred) but fall under the normal unstressed vowel variability. Verbs are affected by this process in their conjugation, when the inflection contains a stressed (there are no verbal suffixes containing a stressed ). For example: * \u00f6ler (\"to want\") ** \u00f6le (\"I want\") ** \u00fcl\u00ect (\"wanted\", past participle) ** \u00fcl\u00ecf (\"you want\", second person plural) ** \u00fcl\u00ecef (\"you wanted\", second person plural imperfect indicative) Adjectives formed with the suffix -\u00f9s (feminine -\u00f9za) also exhibit this rule: * p\u00f3ra (\"fear\") ** pur\u00fas, pur\u00faza (\"fearful person\") ==Orthography== Since Eastern Lombard is still principally an oral language, a commonly accepted orthography has not been established. While in recent years there has been an increasing production of texts (mainly light comedies and poem collections), each author continues to follow their own spelling rules. The most problematic and controversial issues seem to be the representation of intervocalic and (rendered by different authors with , or ) and final vs. (rendered with , or ). This article follows the rules of the Italian orthography, with the following exceptions. ===Vowels=== Diacritic marks are utilized for vowel sounds to distinguish from and from in stressed syllables. Furthermore, the umlaut is adopted to represent the rounded vowels and : {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Letter !! Phoneme |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|a || style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00e9 || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00e8 || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|i || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00f3 || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00f2 || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|u || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00fc || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u00f6 || style=\"text- align:center;\"| |} Note that grave and acute accents are also used to indicate the stressed syllable in non-monosyllabic words. Since unstressed vowels are less distinctive, it is not necessary to discriminate the open/close quality. ===Consonants=== The digraph is used at the end of the word to represent the sound (in other positions this sound is rendered by means of the usual Italian orthography rules: before front vowels and before non-front vowels). A consonant sequence that is peculiar to Lombard is that of a voiceless alveolar fricative followed by a voiceless postalveolar affricate, . This article adopts the convention of representing this sound as , although other texts may follow different traditions (so the same sequence can also be spelled or or even the ambiguous ; some authors use ). This sequence, which is absent in Italian, can occur at the beginning of word, as in s\u00b7c\u00e8t (\"son, boy\") ; in the middle, as in br\u00f6s\u00b7cia (\"brush\") ; or at the end, as in gi\u00f6s\u00b7cc (\"right, correct\", plural) . The sequence is also present in Eastern Lombard and is represented in this article with the sequence of signs , for example: * b\u00e0sgia (\"large bowl\") = * sgionf\u00e0 (\"to inflate\") = ==Grammar== The grammatical system of Eastern Lombard is similar to other those of other Romance languages. The word order is SVO (subject\u2013verb\u2013object) and it has a moderate inflection system: verbs are declined for mood, tense and aspect and agree with their subject in person and number. Nouns are classified as either masculine or feminine and can be marked as singular or plural. Adjectives and pronouns agree with any nouns they modify in gender and number. Eastern Lombard also prefers prepositions over case marking. ==Literature== The oldest known text written in Eastern Lombard consists of fragments of a laud known as Mayor gremeza il mund no pothevela ancor aver, a manuscript found in Bovegno (Trompia valley), and dating from the fourteenth century. Today, literary production has increased in volume and mainly consists in light comedies and poem collections (Angelo Canossi is an example for poetry in the Brescian dialect). ==Examples== The following tale is in Brescian: ===La m\u00e8rla=== I m\u00e8rli 'na \u00f3lta i gh\u00eca le p\u00e8ne bi\u00e0nche, ma ch\u00e8l env\u00e9ren l\u00e9 l'\u00e9ra st\u00e0t en b\u00e8l env\u00e9ren e l\u00e9, la m\u00e8rla, la g\u00e0 d\u00ect: \"Zen\u00e9r de la m\u00e0la gr\u00e0pa, per t\u00f2 desp\u00e8t g\u00f3 i uzil\u00ec 'ndela gn\u00e0ta.\" A l\u00fc, 'l Zen\u00e9r, gh'\u00e8 n\u00ect ad\u00f2s 'n p\u00f3 de r\u00e0bia, e 'l g\u00e0 d\u00ect: \"Sp\u00e8ta, m\u00e8rla, che te la far\u00f3 m\u00e9 ad\u00e8s a t\u00e9, e se te s\u00e9t bi\u00e0nca m\u00e9 te far\u00f3 \u00e8gner n\u00e9gra.\" E p\u00f2 d\u00f2po 'l g\u00e0 dit am\u00f2: \"D\u00f9 ghe i \u00f3 e gi\u00fc 'n pr\u00e8stet el t\u00f6ar\u00f3 e se te s\u00e9t bi\u00e0nca, m\u00e9 te far\u00f3 n\u00ed n\u00e9gra.\" E al\u00f9ra 'l g\u00e0 f\u00e0t n\u00ec f\u00f2 'n fr\u00e8t che se n'\u00eca m\u00e0i v\u00e9st gi\u00fc comp\u00e0gn.

After a popular tradition, January 30 and 31st and February 1 are called I d\u00e9 de la M\u00e8rla (\"the days of the She-Blackbird\") and are expected to be the most cold of the winter. Another version of the same tradition makes I d\u00e9 de la M\u00e8rla fall at the last three days of January. This last is actually a little more widespread and was also told to children to have them remember that February has 28, days explaining this with the fact that January borrowed one from February to be able to chill the blackbird. and I will turn you from white to black.\" And he brought forth a cold as there had never been before. The she-blackbird did not know how to cope with her brood in the nest, so she sheltered in the hood of a chimney, and the smoke turned all the birds black; so when they came out the blackbirds did not have white feathers anymore, but black ones. And January, very happy, said: \"This time it was me that fooled you, blackbird: you were white and I turned you black, this will teach you to stop teasing me.\" ==See also== * Bergamasque * Lombard languages * Western Lombard * Plural inflection in Eastern Lombard ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Orbilat - An interesting site more for western lombard, but the map of the distribution of the two main varieties is noteworthy. * Poetry in Eastern Lombard from 1902 (in Italian) * Copy of the original dictionary Bresciano - Italiano (work in progress, in Italian) * a Casiratese-Italian vocabulary, a dictionary for the Bergamasque (Casirate d'Adda) dialect, in Italian. * A Dictionary for the Camunic variant of Eastern Lombard. * A collection of comedies in Bergamasque Category:Eastern Lombard language ",
