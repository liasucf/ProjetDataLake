    "text": "American Industrial Ballads is a studio album by American folk singer Pete Seeger. It was released in 1956 by Folkways Records. It was reissued in 1992 by Smithsonian Folkways. ==Album== Seeger sings songs of struggle which emerged from the coal mines, textile mills and acres of farmland, and spoke of issues important to the American laborer. Twenty-four songs written about the unprecedented industrialization of the 19th century, including \"Peg and Awl\", \"The Farmer is the Man\", and \"Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues\". Irwin Silber's notes provide a history of labor folk song and its role in American popular music.https://folkways.si.edu/pete-seeger/american-industrial- ballads/american-folk-struggle-protest/music/album/smithsonian The cover design for the 1992 reissue was done by Carol Hardy.https://www.discogs.com/Pete-Seeger-American-Industrial- Ballads/release/2413584 ==Critical reception== Writing for Allmusic William Ruhlman wrote \"Seeger presents the songs straightforwardly with only occasional flourishes, intent on getting the meanings across.\" He continued, \"Taken together, they chronicle a century and a half of the efforts of farmers, textile workers, and miners, primarily, to get what they deserve from increasingly rich and powerful captains of industry.\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/american-industrial-ballads- mw0000273879 ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1957 albums Category:Pete Seeger albums Category:Folkways Records albums ",
