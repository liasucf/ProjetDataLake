    "text": "G\u0127allis Battery (), also known as Pond\u00e9ves Battery, was an artillery battery in Mag\u0127tab, limits of Naxxar, Malta. It was built in 1715\u20131716 by the Order of Saint John as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery has been largely destroyed, but some remains can still be seen. ==History== G\u0127allis Battery was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the battery were G\u0127allis Tower to the west and Qalet Marku Redoubt to the southeast (now demolished). The battery had a semi-circular gun platform. It was to be surrounded by a ditch, but it was only partially excavated and was never completed. In World War II, an emplacement was built on the remains of the blockhouse, possibly for a small field gun. ==Present day== Today, very little remains of the battery survive. Part of one wall of the blockhouse still exists, the partially excavated ditch, and the general outline of the battery's foundations can also be seen. ==References== ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Ruins in Malta Category:Naxxar Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
