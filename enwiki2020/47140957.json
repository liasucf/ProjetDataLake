At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69 based on 6 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! said, \"Lucky 7 is at its best when Statik Selektah delves deep into his jazzier side as a producer, as tracks like \"Beautiful Life\" and \"All I Need\" affirm.\" Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX said, \"If Lucky 7 truly is the end of a particular era and sound, Statik Selektah undoubtedly goes out in spectacular fashion. The beats are on point and each guest is on top of their game; no one disappoints. Lucky 7 doesn\u2019t deviate from the framework of Statik\u2019s previous compilations, but it does highlight his masterful command of each individual track, without ever simplifying the approach or integrity of the album.\" Jay Balfour of Pitchfork Media stated, \"As a whole Lucky 7 sounds a lot like everything else Statik Selektah has done up to this point; the album is neither offputting nor particularly exciting, and it's hard to feel strongly about at all. A couple of the songs sound good enough to have just gotten cut from better solo albums, but that's not a strong selling point.\" ==Track listing== All tracks produced by Statik Selektah. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (2015) !Peak position |- |- |} ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Statik Selektah albums Category:Albums produced by Statik Selektah ",
