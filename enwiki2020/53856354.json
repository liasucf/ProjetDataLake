    "text": "Made in Melbourne (stylized as MADE IN MELBOURNE) is the live video released by the jazz fusion group Casiopea. On June 25, 1992, it was released with a Laser Disc and VHS from Pioneer LDC Inc.. It has been reissued as \"LIVE HISTORY PART 2\" along with \"JOIA\" on September 13, 2000. Also on March 24, 1994, Pioneer LDC released a CD live album. == Background == While recording album \"active\", Casiopea performed live on February 26, 1992 at Club METRO in Melbourne, Australia. The songs that would be like to see were recorded in the video \"MADE IN MELBOURNE\" and the songs that want to be listen carefully were recorded in the album \"We Want More\". In August 1992, Masaaki Hiyama resigned from Casiopea due to health issues, so it is a valuable live image with this member. == Track listing == === DVD === Note A bonus video \"Interview with Nobu Issei\" was added to PIBL-1003. === CD === == Personnel == === Casiopea === *Issei Noro \u2013 Electric guitar, Acoustic guitar *Minoru Mukaiya \u2013 Keyboards *Yoshihiro Naruse \u2013 Electric Bass, Fretless Bass *Masaaki Hiyama \u2013 Drums, Percussion === CD production === * Executive Producer \u2013 Kunihiko Otsuka, Yoshiaki Mizutani * Producer \u2013 Kiyoshi Yoshihara * Recording & Mixing Engineers \u2013 Koji Sugimori * Mastering Engineers \u2013 Tohru Kotetsu * Photograph \u2013 Ryosuke Takashi * Art Direction \u2013 Mitsuaki Takeda === DVD production === * Additional photography \u2013 Mandy Walker * Camera operators \u2013 Ole Witer, Macgregar Knox, Graham Hunter, Gil Oberhoffer, Noel Penn, Gary Meithe, Greg Hill * Hot head operator \u2013 Ralph Marshall * Camera assistants \u2013 Ian McMillan, Greg Harrington * Production assistants \u2013 'Jack' Rather, Bleh Water, Vanessa Elliott * Sound recordist \u2013 Peter Clancy * Gaffer \u2013 Peter Scott * Key grip \u2013 Noel McDonald * Grips \u2013 Adrian Kortus, Peter Stockily, Lee Walker, Ken Sanders, Craig King * CCI operators \u2013 Peter Cuthbertson, David Shelled * Tape operator \u2013 Guy Mackinder * VAR engineer \u2013 Peter Angus * Cable assistants \u2013 Guy Walker, Tim McPhee * Make-up artist \u2013 Kate Steely * Director's assistant \u2013 Ole Water * Telecine operator \u2013 Deidre McCleveland * On-line editor \u2013 Peter Barber * Technical director \u2013 Paul Ellington * O B manager \u2013 Charles Cole * Editor \u2013 Bruce Permezel * Co-producer \u2013 Damian Brinley * Director of photography \u2013 Andrew de Groom * Director \u2013 Bruce Permezel * Producer \u2013 Natalie Elliott * a supersonic vision production * Recording & Mixing Engineer \u2013 Koji Sugimori * Mobile recording \u2013 Michael Wicked, Mathew Themes, Tom Kehoe * Concert sound \u2013 Peter Trojkovic, Michael Long Mire, Chuck Zypolitos, Bob Johnson * Assistants \u2013 Ken Igarashi, Yuji Kuraishi * Stage director \u2013 Hiroaki Nagaoka * PA engineer \u2013 Hiroyuki Shimura * Monitor engineer \u2013 Masahiro Akiyama * Lighting operators \u2013 Hiroyuki Uda, Masaki Hirose * Lighting \u2013 John McCassock, Peter Rickman, Alex Saad, Sasha McKissock * Hair & make up \u2013 Eisuke Shibusawa * Artist producer \u2013 Yoshiaki Mizutani * Artist manager \u2013 Takashi E.
