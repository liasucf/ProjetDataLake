It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Tullynaconspod is bounded on the north by Gowlan townland, on the west by Tullyveela townland, on the south by Corrachomera townland and on the east by Owencam townland. Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, gravel pits and dug wells. Tullynaconspod is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 140 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. The origin of the name probably arose from a battle fought there. The 1930s D\u00fachas Folklore collection states- A battle was fought in Croc\u00e1n na gCamps, Derryconnessy, Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Croc\u00e1n na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. About 100\u2013200 years ago battles were fought in the Townlands of Tullyvella and Conspud between the dead people who fought at the battle of Croc\u00e1n na gCamps. In the morning after these battles were fought, the heather would be red with blood. One night there was a fight in Conspud and a man heard a voice calling him by his Christian name, that a neighbour's house was on fire. He looked out and saw the neighbour's house on fire, but he did not go to it. Next day the house was not burned, but was as if nothing happened. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list three tithepayers in the townland (which is named Disputed Hill in the Tithe Books). and and Tithe Applotment Books 1827 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- The soil is intermixed with lime and freestone...There is no county cess levied on this townland as it is considered only a track of mountain.
