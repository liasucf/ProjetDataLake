In a memorable match at The Oval against Surrey he scored 166 not out as Kent chased a total of 205 to win by eight wickets. Later in the tournament he scored 127 against Essex County Cricket Club at County Ground, Chelmsford as part of a first-wicket stand of 207 runs with Daniel Bell-Drummond. This set records for Kent's Twenty20 highest individual score and partnership and, as of the end of the season, was the highest partnership score for any wicket in T20 cricket in the UK, the third highest anywhere in the world and was a world record for the first wicket. Adam Milne took five wickets in the fixture against Somerset and recorded Kent's best bowling figures in Twenty20 cricket with 5/11. ===South Group=== ===Matches=== ==Statistics== ===Batting=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ First-class (County Championship, MCCU match and Tour match) !Player !Matches !Innings ! !Runs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=\"left\"| |14||24||2||1,266||||57.54||61.45||5||5||3||157||19 |- |align=\"left\"| |13||23||3||1,017||||50.85||67.26||3||4||2||136||8 |- |align=\"left\"| |14||24||0||982||||40.91||54.55||2||4||5||111||7 |- |align=\"left\"| |13||21||3||822||||45.66||78.73||2||5||3||127||7 |- |align=\"left\"| |14||24||1||561||||24.39||47.50||0||3||3||80||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |12||19||2||530||||31.17||54.47||0||3||3||83||4 |- |align=\"left\"| |10||17||0||319||||18.76||44.74||0||1||1||47||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |11||16||2||304||||21.71||91.29||0||1||2||46||6 |- |align=\"left\"| |7||9||2||287||||41.00||78.84||0||1||1||48||2 |- |align=\"left\"| |5||8||0||190||||23.75||39.74||0||0||0||29||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |7||10||3||184||||26.28||44.12||0||1||0||24||2 |- |align=\"left\"| |4||6||2||146||||36.50||48.18||0||0||0||23||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |5||7||0||137||||19.57||50.18||0||1||1||20||2 |- |align=\"left\"| |3||4||1||131||||43.66||55.27||0||0||0||17||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |5||8||2||121||||20.16||51.93||0||1||2||19||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |10||13||5||111||||13.87||71.61||0||0||3||18||2 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||3||1||100||||50.00||58.47||0||1||0||16||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |5||8||3||73||||14.60||33.95||0||0||1||8||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||2||1||65||||65.00||53.71||0||0||0||5||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||3||0||55||||18.33||41.04||0||1||0||7||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |3||5||1||40||||10.00||43.47||0||0||2||6||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||2||1||15||||15.00||43.45||0||0||1||3||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||1||0||5||||5.00||16.12||0||0||0||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |3||1||1||0||||||0.00||0||0||0||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||1||0||0||||0.00||0.00||0||0||1||0||0 |} Source: Cricinfo {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ List A (Royal London One-Day Cup and Regional Super50) !Player !Matches !Innings ! !Runs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=\"left\"| |16||16||1||584||||38.93||78.49||2||2||1||51||3 |- |align=\"left\"| |13||13||0||407||||31.30||105.16||1||1||0||27||24 |- |align=\"left\"| |16||16||3||398||||30.61||106.13||1||1||1||42||10 |- |align=\"left\"| |15||15||0||393||||26.20||70.81||0||2||1||27||8 |- |align=\"left\"| |14||14||0||381||||27.21||79.04||0||3||0||33||5 |- |align=\"left\"| |14||12||6||234||||39.00||64.81||0||1||0||14||3 |- |align=\"left\"| |6||6||0||190||||31.66||76.61||0||2||1||14||3 |- |align=\"left\"| |7||7||0||163||||23.28||78.36||0||0||1||20||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |11||10||0||111||||11.10||115.62||0||0||2||8||8 |- |align=\"left\"| |9||5||0||102||||20.40||75.55||0||0||0||10||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||2||0||93||||46.50||87.73||0||1||0||3||3 |- |align=\"left\"| |10||8||3||70||||14.00||75.26||0||0||2||4||2 |- |align=\"left\"| |6||5||2||68||||22.66||66.01||0||0||1||5||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |4||4||2||54||||27.00||108.00||0||0||0||4||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |4||3||1||34||||17.00||60.71||0||0||0||1||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |4||2||0||25||||12.50||108.69||0||0||0||2||1 |- |align=\"left\"| |6||2||0||18||||9.00||112.50||0||0||1||2||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |7||4||3||11||||11.00||40.74||0||0||0||2||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||2||1||7||||7.00||46.66||0||0||0||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |4||3||1||6||||3.00||35.29||0||0||1||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||1||0||5||||5.00||62.50||0||0||0||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||1||0||2||||2.00||20.00||0||0||0||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |2||2||1||1||||1.00||25.00||0||0||1||0||0 |- |align=\"left\"| |1||0||||'|||||||||||||||| |} Source: CricInfoSeason 2017 - Kent / Records / List A matches / Most runs, CricInfo.
