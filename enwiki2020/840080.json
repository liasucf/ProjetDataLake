He was trained by his father, Jan Baptist Weenix,Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 721. together with his cousin Melchior d'Hondecoeter. Like his father, he devoted himself to a variety of subjects, but his fame is chiefly due to his paintings of dead game and of hunting scenes. Many pictures in this genre formerly ascribed to the elder Weenix are now generally considered to be the works of the son. ==Life== After the Hunt View on the \"Binnen Amstel\", with in the middle the house where Weenix lived. Jan Weenix was born in Amsterdam according to his notice of marriage in 1679 but his date of birth is not exactly known as the baptismal record of this catholic church did not survive. Between 1643 and 1647 his father worked in Italy. Around 1649 the family moved to Utrecht. At some time Jan Baptist Weenix moved into a castle near Vleuten, but died rather young in 1659.Rembrandt's bankruptcy: the artist, his patrons, and the art market in ... By Paul Crenshaw By the age of twenty Jan Weenix rivalled and then subsequently surpassed his father in breadth of treatment and richness of colour. Jan Weenix was a member of the Utrecht guild of painters in 1664 and 1668.Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven (2018) Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings, p. 20 In 1679 when Jan Weenix married the 20-year-old Pieternella Backers he told the schepen he was \"around thirty\"!RKD Between 1680 and 1700 they had 13 children baptized in a hidden church;Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven (2018) Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings, p. 21 at least four sons: Jan Baptista (1680-), Willem Ignatius (1690-1764), Jacobus (1693-), Nicolaes Andreas (1699-1757) and two daughters Sara and Maria. In 1697 he painted a portrait of Peter the Great, visiting the Republic to study shipbuilding, science and the art of fortification building.http://www.arthermitage.org/Jan-Weenix/Portrait-of-Peter-I.html In Amsterdam Weenix was frequently employed to decorate private houses with wall- paintings on canvas. The five fixed paintings or wallpaper on canvas for Jacob de Granada became very popular in the second half of the 18th century, when nature and Rousseau were fashionable and copied. The paintings survived in the house until 1922. Then the enormous \"paintings\" were sold before an auction to William Randolph Hearst in a private arrangement. After Hearst went bankrupt, the paintings were dispersed; one is in the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, two are in Hotel Carlyle in New York, one has been in the Allen Memorial Art Museum since 1953 and one is lost.Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven (2018) Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings, p. 42-43 Landscape with a Huntsman and Dead Game (Allegory of the Sense of Smell) (National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh) Between 1702 and 1712 Weenix was occupied with an important series of twelve large hunting pictures for the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm's castle of Bensberg, near Cologne. (According to Goethe Weenix surpassed nature.) Also Eglon van der Neer, Rachel Ruysch, Adriaen van der Werff had a very good relation with the court, being paid well or knighted as ridder and most probably meeting an international crowd of artists and musicians. The treasury was empty when Jan Wellem, as he was called in D\u00fcsseldorf, died. Most of this collection is now at the Munich Gallery, but the paintings of Van der Werff moved to the cellar. Weenix' pupils were his daughter Maria Weenix and Dirk Valkenburg.Jan Weenix in the RKD Jan Weenix lived most of his life in a house across the Mint Tower and was buried in Nieuwezijds Kapel a nearby catholic church on the Rokin.Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven (2018) Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings, p. 22 His widow and daughters stayed in the masonry business selling stones and tiles.Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven (2018) Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings, p. 24 ==Work== Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was impressed by the treatment of animals in Weenix pictures which he saw in Munich. He devoted a poem to the master's technique in which he stated that Weenix equaled and even surpassed nature in his treatment of animal textures as hair, feathers and claws. Many of his best works are to be found in English private collections. Though the National Gallery, London has only a single example, a painting of dead game and a dog, the Wallace Collection, also in London, has thirteen paintings, including the intriguing (and arguably disturbing) \"Flowers on a Fountain with a Peacock.\" Jan Weenix is well represented in the galleries of Amsterdam, The Hague, Haarlem, Rotterdam, Berlin, Lisbon and Paris. A medium- sized Weenix, \"Still Life with Dead Game\" hangs in the dining room of the Filoli estate in California. A certain \"Still Life with Hunting Trophies\" hangs in the Ackland Art Museum, Chapel Hill, NC, and a large \"Peacock with Hunting Trophies\" hangs in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian. \"Boy with Toys, Pet Monkey and a Turkey\" is in the Kresge Art Museum.Anke A.
