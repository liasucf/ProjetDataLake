Business plans and partnership between Zamboanga City-based businessmen and their counterparts in Sabah has been put on hold over the drastic rise of cases in the Zamboanga City in early May 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the Zamboanga City Reformatory Center which houses about 3.3 thousand inmates and about a hundred personnel despite only being designed to accommodate 400 detainees. Fish canneries in Zamboanga City announced that it would reduce the production of canned fish in the Philippines by 50\u201360% due to difficulties encountered following the implementation of a city-wide lockdown. The Industrial Group of Zamboanga reported that most of its workers experienced difficulties in reporting to work, despite the company offering free shuttle services, due to the wide presence of checkpoints across barangays. Fish canneries in the city also had to reduce outputs due to the deliverers of fish from Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Norte experiencing difficulties in entering the city, as visitors are required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. This prompted most canneries to discourage deliveries. ==Response== The whole of Zamboanga Peninsula has been placed under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) by April 2020. When the ECQ was lifted on May 1, Zamboanga City was allowed by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases to remain under ECQ until May 15. In May 2020, the Zamboanga City Medical Center COVID-19 testing laboratory started operating. ==Notes== == References == Zamboanga Peninsula Category:History of Zamboanga Peninsula ",
