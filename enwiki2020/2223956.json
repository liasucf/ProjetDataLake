    "text": "Ember Swift (born in Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and guitarist who has been writing songs since she was nine years old and performing since she was ten. In 1996, she released her first self-titled album. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a degree in East Asian Studies in 1998, Swift and regular band member Lyndell Montgomery (electric violin) began touring North America, Australia and later, New Caledonia. These live shows featured the additional talents of Toronto-based percussionist and drummer Cheryl Reid as of 1998. Later, the duo began working with Michelle Josef (also of Toronto) and finally, Adam Bowman (of Elmira, Ontario) on drums and percussion. Cheryl Reid continued to work with Swift and Montgomery until 2008 as a part-time player. She has continued to work directly with Swift from 2008 until the present. In 2008, Ember Swift and Lyndell Montgomery, who were also life partners, went their separate ways and ceased their working relationship. Swift had always dreamed of going to China. She had visited in 2007 and had fallen in love with the country and culture there. In 2008, she moved to Beijing and continues to live and work part-time in Beijing, China and Toronto. In Beijing, she assembled a new band consisting of Zac Courtney of Australia on drums, Paplus Ntahombaye of Burundi (Africa) on bass, and China's Wang Ya Qi \u738b\u96c5\u742a on the traditional Chinese instrument, the erhu. All of the members are long-time residents of Beijing. Tours now include many stops throughout in Asia. == Discography == === Albums === * Self-Titled (1996) * InsectInside (1997) * Can't Corner Me (1998) * Permanent Marker (1999) * The Wage is the Stage (live) (2000) * Snapshots (live EP) (2000) * Stiltwalking (2002) * Disarming (2004) * Witness: Live in Australia (2005; DVD) * The Dirty Pulse (2006) * LENTIC (The new project by Ember Swift) (2009) * 11:11 (2011) == Awards == * 2006: \"Youth Role Model of the Year\" \u2013 Jer's Version Foundation * 2006: Best Band Website \u2013 Canadian Independent Music Award ==Personal life== Swift married Chinese musician Guo Jian (\u56fd\u56dd), and gave birth to a daughter and a son. ==References== ==External links== * Ember Swift Category:1970s births Category:Living people Category:Bisexual musicians Category:Bisexual women Category:Canadian female singer-songwriters Category:Canadian folk guitarists Category:Canadian women folk guitarists Category:Canadian folk singer-songwriters Category:LGBT musicians from Canada Category:Musicians from Toronto Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Canadian singers Category:21st-century Canadian women singers Category:21st-century Canadian guitarists ",
