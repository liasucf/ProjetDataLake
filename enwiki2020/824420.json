    "text": "Ludovic Vitet (1865). Ludovic Vitet (18 October 18025 June 1873) was a French dramatist and politician. He was born in Paris. He was educated at the \u00c9cole Normale. His politics were liberal and he was a member of the society \"Aide- toi, le ciel t'aidera.\" On the triumph of liberal principles in 1830, Guizot created an office especially for Vitet, who became inspector-general of historical monuments. In 1834, he entered the Chamber of Deputies, and two years later was made a member of the Council of State. He was consistent in his monarchist principles, and abstained from taking any part in politics during the second empire. The disasters of 1870-71 reawakened Vitet's interest in public affairs, and he published in the Revue des deux mondes his optimistic \"Lettres sur le si\u00e8ge de Paris.\" Vitet was the author of some valuable works on the history of art, and his Monographie de l'\u00c9glise Notre- Dame de Noyon (1845) especially did much to awaken popular interest in architecture. In the early days of the Romantic movement, he wrote some vivid dramatic sketches of the time of the League. They are: *Les Barricades, sc\u00e8nes historiques (1826) *Les \u00c9tats de Blois, sc\u00e8nes (1827) *La Mort de Henri III (1829) All three were published together in 1844 with the title of La Ligue. ==References== Category:1802 births Category:1873 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise ",
