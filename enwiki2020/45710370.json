    "text": "The Serbian Free Corps (), known simply as frajkori (), was a volunteer militia composed of ethnic Serbs, established by the Habsburg Monarchy, to fight the Ottoman Empire during the Austro-Turkish War (1787\u201391). The conflict with Turkish forces ultimately proved inconclusive. The rebellion in the Sanjak of Smederevo and militia's operations resulted in the period of Habsburg-occupied Serbia, which took place from 1788 to 1792. Ultimately, the Serbian volunteer corps had the legacy of promoting the creation of future paramilitaries, such as during the First Serbian Uprising. ==History== A Serbian freikorps of 5,000 soldiers had been established in Banat (Banat Military Frontier), composed of refugees that had fled earlier conflicts in the Ottoman Empire. The Corps would fight for liberation of Serbia and unification under Habsburg rule. The main commander was the Austrian major Mihailo Mihaljevi\u0107. There were several freikorps along the Habsburg-Ottoman frontier. Mihaljevi\u0107's Free Corps, the most notable, was active from \u0160umadija to Podrinje, and across the Morava there was the Brani\u010devo Free Corps; in Croatia the St. George Free Corps; in Bosnia they were called Seressaner. Other Serb militias were the Kozara Militia and Prosar Militia, established in Bosnia in 1788, composed of 1,000 soldiers each. Among volunteers were Aleksa Nenadovi\u0107 and Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, Stanko Aramba\u0161i\u0107 and the prominent Radi\u010d Petrovi\u0107 and most distinguished of all, Ko\u010da An\u0111elkovi\u0107. The Orthodox clergy in Serbia supported the rebellion. Ko\u010da's militia quickly took over Palanka and Bato\u010dina, attacked Kragujevac, and reached the Constantinople road, cutting off the Ottoman army from Sanjak of Ni\u0161 and Sanjak of Vidin. The Austrians used the Corps in two failed attempts to seize Belgrade, in late 1787 and early 1788. ==Organization== According to a document from 6 November 1789, the Free Corps included: * 1 squadron of hussars, * 18 companies of fusiliers, * and 4 companies of musketeers, with a total of 5,049 soldiers. ==Dress== Their uniforms were similar to that of the frontiersmen, with some changes. ==Aftermath== In 1793, the Austrians established the new free corps on the border, for Serbians and Bosnians. ==Legacy== On the eve of the First Serbian Uprising, the U\u017eice and Sokol nahije established volunteer detachments, called frajkori, that had the task of sabotage against Ottoman military plans, and their concentration in this region of Serbia. ==Notable people== *Ko\u010da An\u0111elkovi\u0107, captain 1789 *Aleksa Nenadovi\u0107, commander 1804 *Vu\u010da \u017diki\u0107, captain 1808 *Petar Novakovi\u0107 \u010cardaklija, captain 1808 *Radi\u010d Petrovi\u0107, captain 1816 *Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107, sergeant 1817 ==See also== *Serbian Militia *Serbian Militia (1718\u201339) ==References== ==Sources== * * *Serbian Category:Military history of Austria Category:Military history of Serbia Category:18th century in Serbia Category:18th-century establishments in Serbia Category:Serbia under Habsburg rule Category:Vojvodina under Habsburg rule Category:History of Banat Category:Cavalry units and formations Category:Infantry units and formations Category:Habsburg Serbs Category:Military units and formations of the Early Modern era Category:Military Frontier Category:Serbian mercenaries Category:1787 establishments in the Habsburg Monarchy Category:1792 disestablishments in the Habsburg Monarchy Category:Military units and formations established in 1787 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1792 Category:Volunteer units and formations Category:Army of the Habsburg Monarchy ",
