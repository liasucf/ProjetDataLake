He worked for the French government in Dakar, Senegal, at the Institut fran\u00e7ais d\u2019Afrique noire, then returned to his homeland in 1947. He became part of its movement for independence. Before C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's independence in 1960, he was detained for sixteen months for taking part in demonstrations that opposed the French colonial government.

Amon d'Aby, he founded the Cercle Culturel et Folklorique de la C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (CCFCI) in 1953.Wangar Wa Nyate\u0169-Waigwa, in Simon Gikandi, ed., Encyclopedia of African Literature.
