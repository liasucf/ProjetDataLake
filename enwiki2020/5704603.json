Specifically, it runs beneath Rue de la Fontaine du But where it changes into a staircase. The station takes its name from the two main roads that cross near its entrance: Rue Lamarck and Rue Caulaincourt. ==History== The station opened on 31 October 1912 as part of a northward extension of the Nord-Sud company's Line A from Pigalle to Jules Joffrin. In 1930, the Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain de Paris (CMP) bought out the Nord-Sud company and renamed Line A to Line 12 in order to conform to the former's convention. Originally named Constantin Pecqueur, after the short street at the top of the entrance stairway, which in turn derives its title from the socialist economist of the same name, Lamarck \u2013 Caulaincourt opened as Lamarck, a reference to Rue Lamarck, the road at the bottom of the entrance stairwell. At a later time, the station's name changed to Lamarck (Caulaincourt), and finally received its current spelling of Lamarck \u2013 Caulaincourt. Rue Lamarck is dedicated to Jean- Baptiste Pierre de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744\u20131829), a French naturalist who is mainly remembered for his theory of the inheritance of acquired traits. Rue Caulaincourt is named after the marquis Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt (1773\u20131827), general, ambassador and Foreign Minister from 1813 to 1814. == Station layout == {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|Street Level |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=10 valign=top|Line 12 platforms |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Southbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|\u2190 20px 20px toward Mairie d'Issy |- |Northbound | 20px 20px toward Front Populaire \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} === Design === The station has a very picturesque single entry which is surrounded by two staircases ascending the hill of Montmartre. The platforms are below the entrance and are reached by a lift or a spiral staircase. Like most Paris M\u00e9tro stations, at track level there are two tracks and two side platforms. == In popular culture== M\u00e9tro Lamarck-Caulaincourt is the beautiful Metro station with the double staircase in the film Am\u00e9lie. It is where the blind man experiences a moment of transcendence as Am\u00e9lie describes the mouthwatering sights of the bustling market on rue Lamarck.The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations, Am\u00e9lie (Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain) film locations ==References== Category:Paris M\u00e9tro stations in the 18th arrondissement of Paris Category:Railway stations in France opened in 1912 ",
