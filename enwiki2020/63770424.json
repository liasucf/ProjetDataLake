Gauld was born in Lindsay, Ontario and raised on a farm in Manitoba. She joined the newly-formed Workers Party of Canada, which was known after 1924 as the Communist Party of Canada. She and Annie Buller studied at the Rand School of Social Science in New York City before returning to Montreal and establishing the Montreal Labour College. When that organisation ended in 1924, Gauld helped form the Women's Labour League. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Members of the Communist Party of Canada Category:People from Kawartha Lakes Category:Activists from Montreal Category:Canadian women activists ",
