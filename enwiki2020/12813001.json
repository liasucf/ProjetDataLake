    "text": "RTP3 is a Portuguese 24-hour public-service news channel owned-and-operated by R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal (RTP). The channel is available on basic cable and satellite, as well as a free-to-air channel on terrestrial television. The channel was launched on 15 October 2001 as NTV, a cable news channel headquartered in Porto. It was originally a joint-venture between PT Multim\u00e9dia, Lusomundo and the television broadcaster Radiotelevis\u00e3o Portuguesa (the old RTP). In 2003 it was completely acquired by the old RTP, and with the merger between the old RTP and radio broadcaster Radiodifus\u00e3o Portuguesa (RDP), forming the new RTP, it became RTPN on 31 May 2004. RTPN debuted a 24-hour schedule on 29 September 2008. Up till then, RTPN had simulcasted with Euronews during the early morning. Since mid-2009, RTPN has been available outside Portugal, through cable TV providers in Angola and Mozambique. On 19 September 2011, RTPN was renamed RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o, beginning with a simulcast of Bom Dia Portugal which refreshed its graphics. On 22 July 2015 it was announced that RTP Informa\u00e7\u00e3o would rebrand once again. On 15 September 2015, the date of rebrand was confirmed to be 5 October, RTP's director of programmes Daniel Deusdado told the media. At midnight between 4 and 5 October 2015 Portuguese time, the channel became RTP3, during the coverage of the legislative election 2015. Despite being a news-based channel, occasionally RTP3 also airs some sports programming, such as the Olympics and the FIFA Confederations Cup. Unlike the other national RTP channels, RTP3's continuity and playout is handled at the Monte da Virgem studios, near Porto. Since 1 December 2016, the channel is available on the Portuguese digital terrestrial television. ==Logos and identities== === 2001-2004 === File:Ntvlogo.png|RTP3's first, original and old logo used from 15 October 2001 to 30 May 2004. === 2004-2011 === File:Rtpnportugal.png|RTP3's second and former logo used from 31 May 2004 to 18 September 2011. === 2011-2015 === File:Rtp Informa\u00e7\u00e3o logo 2011.png|RTP3's third and previous logo used from 19 September 2011 to 4 October 2015. === 2015-present === File:Rtp3.png|RTP3's fourth and current logo since 5 October 2015. ==Programming== ===News programmes=== *Bom Dia Portugal (6:30am-10am, simulcast with RTP1) *3 \u00e0s 10 *3 \u00e0s 11 *Jornal das 12 *3 \u00e0s 14 *Zoom \u00c1frica *Eixo Norte Sul *3 \u00e0s 16 *3 \u00e0s 17 *18/20 *Manchete 3 *Online 3 *360 (9pm) *24 Horas (12am, title previously used as a late bulletin on RTP1) *Fareed Zakaria GPS ===Entertainment=== *Last Week Tonight with John Oliver ==References== ==External links== *RTP news website *RTP3 programming guide, including archives of schedules dated back to 2002 *RTP3 Live Stream on RTP Play, including archives of many programmes dated back to 2015 Category:24-hour television news channels in Portugal Category:Television channels and stations established in 2001 Category:Portuguese-language television stations Category:2001 establishments in Portugal Category:R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal ",
