The first formula of the 6.5m, was worked out by Louis Dy\u00e8vre, member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des r\u00e9gates de Vannes, naval architect and member of the French delegation to the congress of London of 1906, is inspired by the formula of the New York Yacht Club in 1903: :\\frac {Lf \\cdot \\sqrt{S}} {\\sqrt[3]{D}} \\le 2.8 Lf represents the waterline length (LWL), S the measured sail area, D displacement. The principal restrictions are: * Maximum length: 6.50 m * Minimum displacement: 600 kg * Draft: 1 m * Measured sail area : 30 m2 * Maximum cockpit area: 2 m2 * The LWL taken into account in the formula is at least of the 4/5 the length. ==Olympic results== ===1920=== {| |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1920 Antwerp details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Netherlands Netherlands (NED) Joop Carp Berend Carp Petrus Wernink |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|France France (FRA) Albert Weil Robert Monier F\u00e9lix Picon |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |} Category:Keelboats Category:Olympic sailing classes Category:Development sailing classes ",
