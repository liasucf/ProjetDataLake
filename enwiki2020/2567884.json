The main line and the Framlingham branch both opened on 1 June 1859, and Wickham Market station opened at the same time. The ESR was absorbed by the ECR on opening day. On 1 July 1862, the ECR and other small railway companies were amalgamated to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER). Upon the 1923 Grouping, the GER was combined with other railways into the London and North Eastern Railway; this in turn was a constituent of British Railways at the start of 1948. The Framlingham branch closed to passenger trains in November 1952; it retained freight services until April 1965. In the meantime, the goods yard at Wickham Market closed in July 1964. With the privatisation of British Rail, ownership of the line and station passed to Railtrack on 1 April 1994. The franchise to operate the passenger services on this route was won by Anglia Railways in 1997; in 2004 National Express won the franchise and operated services using the brand name 'one', which was renamed National Express East Anglia in 2008. In February 2012, the operation of the train service was taken over by Abellio Greater Anglia, a company run by Abellio, the trading name of Dutch railways. ==Services== the typical Monday-Saturday off-peak service at Wickham Market is as follows: {| class=\"wikitable vatop\" !
