At the same time he pursued music courses at the Valencia Conservatory and earned a premier prix in music composition there in 1967. His most influential teacher at that school was Vicente Asencio who taught his harmony, composition, and orchestration classes. In 1969 Evangelista moved to Canada and settled in the city of Montreal.

Evangelista has been active in Canada with the Traditions musicales du monde, a concert society dedicated to promoting non-Western music which he helped found. He developed an interest in the music and culture of Southeast Asia and a number of his compositions reflect that interest. In order to pursue studies in this music, he lived in Indonesia during the summers of 1976 and 1980 and in Burma during the summer of 1986 where he studied the Javanese gamelan and Burmese piano. He was made composer-in-residence at the Akademi Musik Indonesia in Yogyakarta in 1986. ==References== ==External links== * Jos\u00e9 Evangelista's biography on Cdmc website Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish composers Category:Spanish male composers Category:McGill University alumni Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al alumni Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al faculty Category:University of Valencia alumni Category:Spanish expatriates in Canada Category:Valencian composers ",
