It specialises in bright fluorescent dance clothing, often featuring electronic components such as flashing lights. They also specialise in rave accessories such as glowsticks and UV-fluorescent items. The building which currently houses Cyberdog in Camden Market has a good pedigree, between 1976 and 1979 being used by Punk band The Clash as a living space and rehearsal area. ==About== Cyberdog is a store in England that sells rave-wear and toys divided into four categories: Kawaii, Neon Clubwear, 2090s (or Futuristic), and Cybertronic. Within these sections, you can find clothing, jewelry, shoes and rave-toys. Cyberdog is inspired by rave culture and the future. The store is well known in London rave and club culture. Cyberdog was founded by fashion designer Terry Davy and business manager Spiros Vlahos; the two are partners in life as well as in business. Their son is actor Eros Vlahos. They began with a small stall in Camden Market in 1994, mostly selling goa trance items and designer clothing created by Davy. The couple's pet chihuahua, \"Chichi the Cyberdog\", inspired the name of their store and was featured as part of its brand image. The business was a success and grew considerably, relocating to a large underground space in the Stables Market part of Camden Market. There are Cyberdog franchises in Ibiza Town, a world- renowned centre of club culture in the Balearic Islands of Spain, and Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town in Egypt.https://www.cyberdog.net/pages/contact/ Stores were previously also located in Manchester (closed its doors in February 2018) and Brighton (closed its doors in January 2019).https://twitter.com/BrightonSource/status/1090610842939412482 In November 2012, Cyberdog announced the launch of a sister brand 'Futurelovers', selling sex toys and fetish clothing. ==See also== ==References== * https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/style-bright-things-1164572.html * https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interiors-space-1999-1072104.html * http://style.mtv.com/2013/02/04/venus-x-these-are-a-few-of-her-favorite- things/ ==External links== * *Cyberdog on the Camden Town website *Cyberdog on the Camden Guide Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom ",
