    "text": "The Deutsche Eishockey Liga (for sponsorship reasons called \"PENNY Deutsche Eishockey Liga\") (; English: German Ice Hockey League) or DEL, is a German professional ice hockey league that was founded in 1994. It was formed as a replacement for the Eishockey-Bundesliga and became the new top-tier league in Germany as a result. Unlike the old Bundesliga, the DEL is not under the administration of the German Ice Hockey Federation. In the 2016\u201317 season the league was the second-best supported in Europe, behind the Swiss National League A, with an average attendance of 6,198 spectators per game. K\u00f6lner Haie, D\u00fcsseldorfer EG and Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin all regularly attract over 15,000 fans for home games. In the DEL Winter Game, similar to the NHL Winter Classic, K\u00f6lner Haie (Cologne Sharks) and D\u00fcsseldorf have played in front of crowds in excess of 40,000, notably in 2019 as D\u00fcsseldorf won in the RheinENERGIE Stadion. As of the start of the 2020-21 DEL season, Adler Mannheim (Mannheim Eagles) are the defending champions from the 2018-19 DEL season, defeating the three-time defending champions EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen in a 4-1 series win in the DEL finals. The 2019-20 DEL season was ended after the regular season due to the Covid-19 pandemic, at which point EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen had clinched the #1 seed for the DEL playoffs. The DEL is known for having a great game day atmosphere with a few large modern arenas and other older, smaller venues. The German top flight is also known for producing NHL talents including Dominik Kahun from Red Bull M\u00fcnchen. Many of the German national team that took silver at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang played in the DEL while Red Bull Munich became the first German team to reach the Champions Hockey League final in 2019, losing to Fr\u00f6lunda HC. Ice hockey is growing as a sport in Germany and is seen as a popular alternative to football or handball. Until 2020, there was no relegation from the DEL although a promotion/relegation with the DEL2 will be introduced from the 2020-21 DEL season where the bottom placed DEL club will be replaced by the DEL2 champions. ==History== The Eishockey-Bundesliga was formed in 1957 as the elite hockey competition in the Federal Republic of Germany, replacing the Oberliga in this position. It was in turn replaced by the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, which now also carries the name 1st Bundesliga in its logo. Krombacher Brewery Former DEL logo (1997\u20132001) Former DEL logo (2001\u20132011) The DEL was founded in the 1994\u201395 season, consisting of teams from the Eishockey- Bundesliga's 1st and 2nd divisions. The condition of these earlier leagues had become intolerable. Many 1st and 2nd division teams were heavily in debt. The 2nd division attracted few sponsors and spectators. As a result, many clubs were forced to fold or withdraw to the lower leagues. Fans and corporate sponsors focused on the 1st Bundesliga teams, forcing the elite teams to invest heavily in players to avoid relegation. This increased budgets 25 percent over the previous two years. In the final Bundesliga season, 1993\u201394, only 11 teams wanted to play in the 2nd Bundesliga. Furthermore, two teams folded during and after the season. Ice hockey's reputation in Germany was heavily tarnished. This made it difficult to attract serious sponsorship. In January 1994, 20 out of the remaining 21 1st and 2nd Bundesliga teams voted for creating a new entity, the DEL. Upon founding, the \"DEL Betriebsgesellschaft mbH\" was the first German professional sports league managed by an organization whose members were incorporated as well. The goal behind the DEL was to create a league, based on the model of the North American NHL, in which teams could play consistently without relegation concerns and create a stable league. Clubs in the DEL were required to conform to rules, which were designed to ensure long-term viability. Twelve clubs from the old 1st Bundesliga, and six from the 2nd Bundesliga came together as founding members. The new league immediately attracted corporate sponsorship with the Krombacher Brewery, which was prominently featured on the new league logo. The hope of avoiding the troubles of the old Bundesliga by stricter financial controls did not materialize. During DEL's initial season, on 18 December 1994, the Bundesliga's final champion, the renamed EC Hedos M\u00fcnchen, folded. This was controversial, as DEL's president Franz Hofherr had approved their license and certified their finances. Hofherr was Mad Dogs former president and it was alleged that he must have known about their desperate financial situation. The Bosman ruling, a 1995 decision of the European Court of Justice regarding the movement of labor in soccer, had profound influence on the league. The old Bundesliga had national character with German clubs competing for the German title using mostly German players. After the ruling European Union players were excluded from the \"foreign\" player quota. In the 1995\u201396 season following the decision, the DEL teams employed 97 EU players. This lowered costs significantly, enabling smaller teams to compete more effectively. However, frequent player moves were not viewed positively by the fans, resulting in smaller attendance numbers. Following an agreement with the DEB the league renamed itself as \"DEL \u2013 Die 1. Bundesliga\" in the 1999\u20132000 season, while reintroducing relegation and promotion to/from the 2nd Ice Hockey Bundesliga. The 2004\u201305 season was significant due to the NHL lockout. 26 NHL players came to play the season in the DEL, including Jamie Langenbrunner, Erik Cole, St\u00e9phane Robidas, Doug Weight, Mike York and several German national team players \u2013 Jochen Hecht, Olaf K\u00f6lzig, and Marco Sturm. ==League regulations== The DEL is an independently run league, fully owned and operated by its 14 member teams. Each team must fulfill the DEL's basic requirements to remain in the league: * A written application for membership; * \"On ice qualification\" for new teams (championship in the 2nd Bundesliga); * A stadium that meets DEL standards; * Financial qualification; * Formation of an ordinary company (the DEL consists of franchises); * Development program for young players; and * Purchase of a license (currently, the licensing fee is set at \u20ac800,000.00) The DEL can only admit one 2nd Bundesliga team per season to the league, unless the league strength falls below fourteen, in which case two clubs can be admitted. Since the 2006\u201307 season, no DEL team can be automatically relegated, a team can only lose its league status through non-compliance with the leagues regulations (see above). The ESBG guarantees to admit any DEL team wishing to step down to the lower 2nd Bundesliga or Oberliga. The team, however, has to purchase a license (licensing fees for the 2nd Bundesliga are currently set at \u20ac100,000.00). To regulate the relationship between the DEL, the DEB and the ESBG (2nd Bundesliga), a so-called Kooperationsvertrag exists. This cooperation contract was signed in December 2005, and was valid until 2011. This contract ended years of dispute between the three organizations over competencies and financial issues. In November 2007, the DEL announced another change in policy. The league expanded to allow 16 teams beginning in the 2008\u201309 season, resulting in direct promotion for the 2nd Bundesliga league champions, should they fulfill all requirements and be interested in joining the DEL. Should this not be the case, or a current DEL team resigns from the league, a selection process would determine the club, or clubs, who would be eligible to join in order required to achieve 16 teams. (Note: F\u00fcchse Duisburg resigned before the 2009\u201310 season and was not replaced until the following season.) For that season, it was also mandated that each DEL club would be allowed to have no more than ten non-EC players under contract. Additionally, a new format for the game schedule will limit the number of regular season games to 52 for each team. This is achieved by each team playing four games against eleven others and two games against the remaining four. To determine which teams play which, the final standings of the previous season are used. The DEL would also reintroduce promotion once more. The first- and second-lowest ranked teams will play a best-of-seven series to determine which team faces the 2nd Bundesliga champion for a place in the league. There is, however, an ongoing dispute about those games as second division teams may only have five foreign players on contract, and therefore face a handicap in comparison to the DEL teams with twelve import players each. For now, the ESBG has declared that no team from the 2nd Bundesliga would take part in these matches and therefore no promotion/relegation with the DEL will take place. ==Teams== Members of the 2020\u201321 DEL season. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"200\"|Team !width=\"180\"|City !Arena !Capacity |- |Augsburger Panther |Augsburg |Curt Frenzel Stadium |6,218 |- |Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin |Berlin |Mercedes-Benz Arena |14,200 |- |Fischtown Pinguins |Bremerhaven |Eisarena Bremerhaven |4,674 |- |D\u00fcsseldorfer EG |D\u00fcsseldorf |ISS Dome |13,400 |- |ERC Ingolstadt |Ingolstadt |Saturn Arena |4,815 |- |Iserlohn Roosters |Iserlohn |Eissporthalle Iserlohn |5,000 |- |K\u00f6lner Haie |Cologne |Lanxess Arena |18,500 |- |Krefeld Pinguine |Krefeld |K\u00f6nig Palast |9,000 |- |Adler Mannheim |Mannheim |SAP Arena |13,600 |- |EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen |Munich |Olympia Eishalle |6,256 |- |N\u00fcrnberg Ice Tigers |Nuremberg |Arena N\u00fcrnberger Versicherung |7,810 |- |Schwenninger Wild Wings |Villingen-Schwenningen |Helios Arena |6,215 |- |Straubing Tigers |Straubing |Eisstadion am Pulverturm |6,000 |- |Grizzlys Wolfsburg |Wolfsburg |Eis Arena Wolfsburg |4,660 |} ===Former teams=== * BSC Preussen Berlin later BSchC Preussen, dissolved 2005 refounded as Eissport & Schlittschuh Club 2007 Berlin * Frankfurt Lions dissolved 5 July 2010 due to bankruptcy * F\u00fcchse Duisburg * ESG F\u00fcchse Sachsen Wei\u00dfwasser/Chemnitz now Lausitzer F\u00fcchse * Hamburg Freezers ceased operations 24 May 2016 * EC Hannover now Hannover Indians * Hannover Scorpions * Kassel Huskies dissolved 27 August 2010 due to bankruptcy * Kaufbeurer Adler * EV Landshut * Maddogs M\u00fcnchen dissolved 1994 due to bankruptcy * Moskitos Essen * Munich Barons relocated in 2002 to become Hamburg Freezers * EC Ratingen \"Die L\u00f6wen\" relocated in 1997 to become Revierl\u00f6wen Oberhausen * Revierl\u00f6wen Oberhausen * Starbulls Rosenheim * SC Riessersee * W\u00f6lfe Freiburg ==DEL seasons== ===Past champions=== * 1994\u201395 K\u00f6lner Haie * 1995\u201396 D\u00fcsseldorfer EG * 1996\u201397 Adler Mannheim * 1997\u201398 Adler Mannheim * 1998\u201399 Adler Mannheim * 1999\u201300 Munich Barons * 2000\u201301 Adler Mannheim * 2001\u201302 K\u00f6lner Haie * 2002\u201303 Krefeld Pinguine * 2003\u201304 Frankfurt Lions * 2004\u201305 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2005\u201306 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2006\u201307 Adler Mannheim * 2007\u201308 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2008\u201309 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2009\u201310 Hannover Scorpions * 2010\u201311 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2011\u201312 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2012\u201313 Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin * 2013\u201314 ERC Ingolstadt * 2014\u201315 Adler Mannheim * 2015\u201316 EHC M\u00fcnchen * 2016\u201317 EHC M\u00fcnchen * 2017\u201318 EHC M\u00fcnchen * 2018\u201319 Adler Mannheim * 2019\u201320 EHC M\u00fcnchen (RS) 7 ===All-time standings=== 32 clubs have played in the DEL since founding, with 14 currently playing.
