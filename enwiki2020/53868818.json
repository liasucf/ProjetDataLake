    "text": "Information Processing in Medical Imaging, or IPMI, is a biennial conference focused on the fields of applied mathematics, computer science, and image analysis (particularly analysis of medical images); applied results in neuroscience, cardiology, and microscopy are also frequently considered. IPMI is the longest standing conference focused on medical images having first met, organized by Dr. Francois Erbsmann, in Brussels in 1969. IPMI 2021 is scheduled to be held in Bornholm, Denmark in June 2021. == History == The Information Processing in Medical Imaging conference \u2013 IPMI - was first organized by Francois Erbsmann and collaborators in Brussels in 1969. That first conference was held under the title, \u201cInformation Processing in Scintigraphy\u201d as at the time the meeting was focused on restoration of those images derived by nuclear medicine. Since that first instance, the conference has successfully met every two years. The third instance of the meeting, organized by Stephen Pizer and Charles Metz, was its first appearance in the United States and since that occasion IPMI has alternated its venue between the U.S. and Europe. It was the 1977 meeting organized by Randy Brill in Nashville that first used the name IPMI to reflect the broadening community of physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and biologists interested in medical image computing in its many manifestations and applications who now contributed to the meeting. Commemorating his contribution as the conference founder, beginning with IPMI 1987 the Francois Erbsmann prize is awarded by the IPMI board each conference to one young investigator for outstanding contribution to the field. This investigator must have given their first oral presentation at the current IPMI. Standing with tradition, IPMI includes a single track of presentations on novel methodology wherein speakers are allotted sufficient time to describe their contributions in thorough detail. Discussions following each presentation have no time-limit permitting stimulating debate and resolution of any questions or comments regarding the work, alternatives to it, additional possible applications, etc. Further, the paper associated with each presentation is assigned a study-group of attendees in advance rendering a portion of the community prepared to provide real time peer discussion in high technical detail. Study groups often pair younger researchers with field experts encouraging an exchange of experience and new ideas. Often, discussions and debates are continued through meals and social activities uniting the community through vigorous evaluation of avant-garde developments in medical imaging. To permit such depth the conference is limited to a maximum of 120 participants. Reflecting its focus on depth and community, IPMI is often held in a relatively small and sometimes remote location. Attendees are accommodated together in collective housing in campus or university dorms, meals are typically enjoyed together by the entire community, and by a string of luck IPMI conferences have thus far been held in close proximity to a bar open sufficiently late to host continued scholarly debate. Further, IPMI fosters collaboration through its several social functions including the traditional soccer match and activities that take advantage of the typically remote setting. For its tradition, intellectual value, and community building IPMI is a conference that many attendees very much look forward to. == Past IPMI Proceedings == The proceedings of the conference including all papers accepted for presentation are published by Springer in the series titles, \"Lecture Notes on Computer Science\" and \"Image Processing, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, and Graphics.\" Some proceedings available online include those from the following years: 1983 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 == Past Francois Erbsmann Prize Winners == 1987 (Utrecht, The Netherlands): John M.
