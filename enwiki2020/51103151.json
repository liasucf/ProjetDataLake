Motagua and Victoria played at Estadio Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino became the first and only game as of today in Honduran football history that had three 15 minutes extra times. This happened in the very last match of the final round which Victoria won 3\u20132, a score that resulted in both teams finishing with 4 points each. After 135 minutes of exhausting play, the game remained tied and the title undecided.
