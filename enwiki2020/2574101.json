It is one of few Latvian deities whose historical sources can be derived to be more or less genuine testimony.Latvian folklore: \u016asi\u0146\u0161 With \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day begins summer:Who is \u016asi\u0146\u0161 as they bestow fields with green grass and trees with green leaves. Therefore on \u016asi\u0146i guys drove horses to piegu\u013ca for the first time. \u016asi\u0146i coincidences with Jur\u0123i on 23 April (in Gregorian calendar \u016asi\u0146i falls on 9 May), which is the Christian Church's deposit. \u016asi\u0146\u0161 has its own ornamental sign, which is similar to two letter E facing their backs against each other.valoda.ailab.lv \u016asi\u0146\u0161 This sign is the most common ornament for gloves. There is a belief, that such gloves grant the wearer with good luck on the road, and such gloves are called atsl\u0113gai\u0146i. The most important symbol of \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day is a foal, which can be interpreted differently. It is both the power of Dievas, human energy, and a phallic symbol because sexual power is equal to the creative energy. Yellow foal symbolizes energy from the Sun. With \u016asi\u0146\u0161 it is also linked to someone else's image \u2013 the golden grass snake, which in turn, a snake is a symbol of energy flow. ==Etymological origin of the name== The word \"\u016bsi\u0146\u0161\" has several explanations. Gotthard Friedrich Stender linked that name with \u016bz\u0101m \u2013 trousers, which are of yellow color. Stender also called \u016asi\u0146\u0161 a bee god. However, there is conflicting data on \u016asi\u0146\u0161 being a bee god. 19th century folklore materials called \u016azi\u0146\u0161 a bee god, while a horse god \u2013 \u016asi\u0146\u0161. In late 19th century R. Auni\u0146\u0161 called \u016asi\u0146\u0161 the god of light, by explaining with the sound \"us\", which can also be found in the word \u2013 aust (day). Also, H. Biezais in his study on a Latvian deity \u016asi\u0146\u0161 (God of light in ancient Latvian religion, 1994) come to the conclusion, that \u016asi\u0146\u0161 typologically belongs to heavenly deities, and the specific features allowed him to be considered as the god of light. On the other hand J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns felt, that the word \u016bsi\u0146\u0161 has no Latvian origin, but was borrowed from a Germanic word \u2013 husing (home spirit). After some time Endzel\u012bns reflects on and considers, that the word \u016bsi\u0146\u0161 derives from a Russian word \u0443\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c or \u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c and that the same deity was borrowed from Russian people. While Vladimir Toporov in his studies concludes, that \u016asi\u0146\u0161 is an ancient and mythical deity of several nations. Folk songs expressed visible merging process of \u016asi\u0146\u0161 and Jur\u0123i. According to older writings Jur\u0123i Day on 23 April was also known as \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day, which were mainly related to the beginning of the spring work, resuming to shepherd livestock and piegu\u013ca. \u016asi\u0146\u0161 is similar to an Egyptian Usir (who by Greek language influences was known as Osiris). It has similarities with an Indian people Ashvini (Sanskrit USHAS means dawn). And finally, he is compared with Greek Dioskouri or Sons of God, who like \u016asi\u0146\u0161 transport the Sun. And \u016asi\u0146\u0161 also is known as Son of God. ==\u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day celebration== On \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day horses are released for the first piegu\u013ca after winter. Farmers fully entrust their horses to \u016asi\u0146\u0161, handing them over under his guardianship. Folk songs mention, that \u016asi\u0146\u0161 himself belongs to horses, moreover, they are very well cared for. Since \u016asi\u0146\u0161 is the god of light, it was horses that transported the sun.\u016asi\u0146\u0161 An important place in descriptions of traditions is paid to a sacrifice. A black cock with nine crests and red legs is sacrificed to \u016asi\u0146\u0161. Rooster's blood was drained in horse's manger directly on oats. There was a belief, that blood, which is given to \u016asi\u0146\u0161, blessed the beast's home. Later during piegu\u013ca the rooster is cooked and eaten by piegu\u013cnieki. During piegu\u013ca eggs are boiled and cooked into a special \u016asi\u0146i dish \u2013 pant\u0101ga. \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day was held on horse market day when they were bought and sold. \u016asi\u0146\u0161 Day was met with a rumble and great noisiness, which ties in with spring thunder nature.\u016asi\u0146\u0161 leads the Sun uphill ==\u016asi\u0146\u0161 in Latvian dainas== {| | \u016asi\u0146\u0161 of Horses, M\u0101r\u0161avi\u0146a of Cows, Barbi\u0146a of Goats, Teniss of Pigs, Ann\u012bte of Sheep, Urbans of Calves, Protect my beasts From pestilence, from wolves! 29202 | \u016asi\u0146\u0161 stands by a fence, Waitin', to ask for a room.
