    "text": "The West Yorkshire Built-up Area, previously known as the West Yorkshire Urban Area is a term used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to refer to a conurbation in West Yorkshire, England, based on the cities of Leeds, Bradford and Wakefield, and the large town of Huddersfield. It is the 4th largest urban area in the United Kingdom. However, it excludes other large towns and suburbs such as Castleford, Pontefract and Wetherby which, though part of the county of West Yorkshire and often contiguous with the built-up area, are considered independently. There are substantial areas of agricultural land within the designated area - more than in any other official urban area in England - many of the towns and cities are only just connected with one another by narrow outlying strips of development. Map of the main settlements Leeds is the largest settlement, and also the 3rd largest city in the United Kingdom Bradford is the second largest settlement, and is also a major city being the 6th largest in the United Kingdom by population Huddersfield is one of the country's largest Market towns and is situated only 15 miles from Greater Manchester Wakefield is one of three cities in the conurbation, and was a main centre for the coal mining industry in the United Kingdom Halifax has been a main centre for the wool industry since the 15th century, and is the 5th largest settlement in the conurbation == Urban subdivisions == The ONS gives the conurbation a population of 1,777,934 (2011 census), which makes it the fourth-most populous in the UK. The ONS partitions the area down into 39 sub- divisions: *Baildon *Batley *Bingley *Bottom Boat *Bradford *Brighouse *Burley in Wharfedale *Carlton *Cleckheaton *Dewsbury *East Morton *Guiseley *Halifax *Haworth *Heckmondwike *Holmfirth *Horbury *Horsforth *Huddersfield *Keighley *Leeds *Liversedge *Menston *Middlestown *Mirfield *Morley *Netherton *Ossett *Otley *Pudsey *Robin Hood *Rothwell *Scholes *Shipley *Sowerby Bridge *Thornton *Wakefield *Walton *Yeadon Three further subdivisions are given with no population numbers as they are present or former industrial areas with no resident population. Rawdon is the subdivision name for Horsforth Vale, on which a former industrial plant was redeveloped for housing from 2010, too late to be recorded for the 2011 census. *Brookfoot Quarry (Marshalls Southowram) *Esholt Water Treatment plant, named 'Works, nr Bradford' by the ONS *Rawdon Note that the areas below do not have exactly the same borders in each census, so the numbers are not always comparable (e.g. what was classified as Lofthouse/Stanley in 2001 was classified as part of Wakefield in 2011). {| class=\"wikitable\" !# !Subdivision !Population 2011 !Population 2001 !Population 1991 !Population 1981 |- |1 |Leeds |474,632 |443,247 |424,194 |445,242 |- |2 |Bradford |349,561 |293,717 |289,376 |293,336 |- |3 |Huddersfield |162,949 |146,234 |143,726 |147,825 |- |4 |Wakefield |99,251 |76,886 |73,955 |74,764 |- |5 |Halifax |88,134 | | | |- |6 |Batley |80,485 |49,448 |48,030 |45,582 |- |7 |Dewsbury |62,945 |54,341 |50,168 |49,612 |- |8 |Keighley |53,331 |49,453 |49,567 |49,188 |- |9 |Brighouse |33,286 |32,360 |32,198 |32,597 |- |10 |Pudsey |32,216 |32,391 |31,636 |31,943 |- |11 |Morley |29,673 |54,051 |47,579 |44,652 |- |12 |Shipley |28,694 |28,162 |28,165 |28,815 |- |13 |Bingley |22,493 |19,884 |19,585 |18,954 |- |14 |Holmfirth |21,706 | | | |- |15 |Ossett |21,231 |21,076 |20,405 |20,417 |- |16 |Yeadon |19,668 | | | |- |17 |Rothwell |19,512 | | | |- |18 |Mirfield |19,330 |18,390 |18,459 |18,599 |- |19 |Horsforth |18,895 |18,928 |18,593 |19,205 |- |20 |Liversedge |17,697 | | | |- |21 |Baildon |15,944 |15,368 |15,385 |14,907 |- |22 |Otley |14,215 | | | |- |23 |Heckmondwike |12,085 |11,291 |9,855 |9,775 |- |24 |Guiseley |11,960 | | | |- |25 |Cleckheaton |11,648 | | | |- |26 |Horbury |10,361 |10,002 |9,186 |9,792 |- |27 |Burley in Wharfedale |7,041 | | | |- |28 |Haworth |6,379 | | | |- |29 |Thornton |5,289 | | | |- |30 |Sowerby Bridge |4,601 | | | |- |31 |Menston |4,369 |4,660 |4,888 |4,865 |- |32 |Netherton |3,686 | | | |- |33 |Robin Hood |3,573 | | | |- |34 |Walton |3,231 | | | |- |35 |Middlestown |2,366 | | | |- |36 |Scholes |2,317 | | | |- |37 |Bottom Boat |1,169 | | | |- |38 |East Morton |1,169 | | | |- |39 |Carlton |842 | | | |- | |Guiseley/Yeadon | |31,381 |31,104 |30,811 |- | |Cleckheaton and Liversedge | |26,796 |27,151 |26,340 |- | |Lofthouse/Stanley | |22,947 |19,136 |17,439 |- | |Holmfirth/Honley | |22,690 |21,979 |21,138 |- | |Queensbury | |8,718 |7,424 |7,410 |- | |Shelf | |4,496 |4,237 |4,204 |- | |New Farnley | |2,548 | | |- | colspan=\"2\" |Total |1,777,934 |1,499,465 |1,445,981 |1,467,412 |} 2011 subdivision notes: Lofthouse merged into Wakefield.
