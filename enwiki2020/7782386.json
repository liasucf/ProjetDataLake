According to an October 18, 2010 issue of \"Nature Online\" Laura Longo, an archeologist at University of Siena in Italy found evidence of Brachypodium and cattail (Typha spp.) residues on prehistoric human grinding tools dated 28,000 years ago from Bilancino in central Italy. A related article authored by Anna Revedin, Biancamaria Aranguren, Roberto Becattini, Laura Longo, Emanuele Marconi, Marta Mariotti Lippi, Natalia Skakun, Andrey Sinitsyn, Elena Spiridonova, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Svoboda, was contemporaneously published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America and clarifies that the grain residues resemble Brachypodium, based on a comparison to two modern specimens: \"Among these, the grains, which are slightly angular, with hardly visible centric, point-shaped hila and adequate dimensions (in the sample measuring 9\u201314 \u03bcm), appeared very similar to those of Brachypodium or related genera.\" ;SpeciesThe Plant List search for Brachypodium * Brachypodium \u00d7 ambrosii - Spain * Brachypodium \u00d7 apollinaris - Spain * Brachypodium arbusculum - Canary Islands * Brachypodium bolusii - Lesotho, South Africa * Brachypodium \u00d7 cugnacii - Denmark, Ireland, France, Czech Rep * Brachypodium \u00d7 diazii - Spain * Brachypodium distachyon - Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel, southwest Asia from Portugal + Cape Verde to Sudan + Ukraine + Tibet * Brachypodium firmifolium - Cyprus * Brachypodium flexum - Africa from Sierra Leone to KwaZulu-Natal + Madagascar * Brachypodium humbertianum - Madagascar * Brachypodium kawakamii - Taiwan * Brachypodium kotschyi - Turkey * Brachypodium madagascariense - Madagascar * Brachypodium mexicanum - Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia * Brachypodium perrieri - Madagascar * Brachypodium phoenicoides - Mediterranean from Portugal + Morocco to Greece * Brachypodium pinnatum - Africa + Eurasia from Ireland + Morocco to China + Yakutia * Brachypodium pringlei - Mexico (Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Tamaulipas, Coahuila) * Brachypodium retusum - Mediterranean + nearby areas from Portugal + Morocco to Ethiopia + Caucasus * Brachypodium sylvaticum - Africa + Eurasia from Ireland + Morocco to Korea + New Guinea ;formerly included numerous species once considered members of Brachypodium but now considered better suited to other genera: Agropyron Anthosachne Arundinella Brachyelytrum Brachysteleum Catapodium Cutandia Distichlis Elymus Festuca Festucopsis Lolium Micropyrum Poa Ptychomitrium Rostraria Triticum Vulpia ==See also== *List of Poaceae genera ==References== ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Grass Manual Treatment *Botanica Sistematica Category:Poaceae genera Category:Taxa named by Palisot de Beauvois ",
