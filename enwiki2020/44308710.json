The People\u2019s Artist Karen Khachaturian also gave Khondzinsky a flattering description by calling him one of the most outstanding and talented musicians of the new generation and his conducting brilliant.

In 2014, he became music director of the exclusive project \"Arkhitektura Zvuka\" (The Sound Architecture) by the theatre \"Balet-Moskva\".
