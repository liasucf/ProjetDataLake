His father led the failed Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 and was beheaded in July of that year. The surname Crofts had been used by his father. Crofts entered the Army in the early part of the reign of Queen Anne, rose to the rank of colonel by 1706, and in 1718 succeeded Sir Robert Rich in the command of a regiment of dragoons, which was disbanded later the same year. On 6 July 1719 he obtained the colonelcy of the regiment of dragoons later known as the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, and in 1727 he was promoted to the rank of major- general. He died at his house in Downing Street, London, in March 1732.Richard Cannon, Historical Record of the Ninth, or the Queen's Royal Regiment of Lancers (London, 1841) p. 59. ==Descendants== Allan Fea states that Crofts married a daughter of Sir Thomas Taylor (\u201cafter 1706, when he is described as single\u201d) and had a daughter, Maria Julia; and that she married first a Mr Dalziel and secondly R. Wentworth Smyth-Stuart, who claimed to be Monmouth\u2019s son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth.Allan Fea, King Monmouth: Being a History of the Career of James Scott \"The Protestant Duke\" 1649-1685 (1902), pp. 359\u2014361 John Ferdinand Smyth Stuart claimed to be the son of this marriage, but many of his claims have been challenged by Anthony J. Camp.Anthony J. Camp, John Ferdinand Smyth: loyalist and liar at anthonyjcamp.com, as published in Genealogists' Magazine, vol. 31, no. 11 (September 2015) In another theory, James Crofts and his mistress Grace Camfield had a daughter who married Gibson Dalziel and was the mother of Maria Julia Dalziel, who then married Colonel Charles Smyth, the son of Monmouth and Lady Wentworth.English Origins of New England Families: From the New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Second Series, Volume 3, pp. 410, 416, 421, 426 However, the mother of Gibson Dalziel\u2019s lawful children was an illegitimate daughter of John Augier.Gibson Dalzell, born 1698, the son of General Robert Dalziel, died in London in 1756, leaving estates in Jamaica to a daughter, Frances, and a son, Robert. The mother of his children was Susanna Caillard or Augier, daughter of John Augier (d. 1722), a Jamaica planter who freed his illegitimate children (including Susanna) in his will.
