    "text": "Pilipit is a traditional Filipino deep-fried twisted doughnut. It is made with flour, eggs, milk, salt, and baking powder. It is made mostly identically to the shakoy doughnut, except for its crunchy and hard texture and its smaller and thinner size. The word pilipit means \"twisted\" in Tagalog. A very similar but distinct dessert, also known as pilipit, is a fried glutinous rice twisted doughnut from Maguindanao. It is much thicker and is made with a combination of white glutinous rice and purple rice, resulting in a distinctive lavender color. It is soaked and pounded into galapong and twisted into shapes before deep-frying. It is served sprinkled with fresh grated coconut. ==See also== *Kumukunsi *Lokot-lokot *Binangkal *Panyalam == References == Category:Doughnuts Category:Philippine snack food ",
