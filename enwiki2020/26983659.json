The fixtures were announced on 22 May 2010 and the season began on 6 August and ended on 27 May 2011. The winter break would be in effect between 22 December and 14 January 2011. There were three promoted teams from the Championnat National, replacing the three teams that were relegated from Ligue 2 following the 2009\u201310 season. A total of 20 teams currently competes in the league with three clubs suffering relegation to the third division, the Championnat National. All clubs that secured Ligue 2 status for the season were subject to approval by the DNCG before becoming eligible to participate.The DNCG is responsible for overseeing the legal and financial accounts of professional football clubs in France. If clubs operating in French football don't meet the DNCG's expectations, they can face sanctions, such as relegation. In addition, German sportswear company Puma, whom the Ligue de Football Professionnel share a partnership with, provided a brand new match ball for the new season. ==Teams== Grenoble was the first club to suffer relegation to Ligue 2. The club's impending drop occurred on 10 April 2010 following the team's 4\u20130 defeat to Toulouse. On 3 May 2010, both US Boulogne and Le Mans were relegated to Ligue 2 following defeats. Le Mans relegation was confirmed following their 3\u20132 loss away to Nancy, while Boulogne suffered relegation after losing 1\u20130 to Saint-\u00c9tienne, who both Boulogne and Le Mans were trailing. Boulogne's return to Ligue 2 meant a short-lived stay in the highest division. The club had successfully earned promotion to Ligue 1 the previous year. Due to suffering relegation to Ligue 2, Le Mans will unveil their new logo and new name, Le Mans Football Club, as well as their new stadium, MMArena, while playing in the second division. In the Championnat National, \u00c9vian was the first club to achieve promotion to Ligue 2 after defeating Amiens 1\u20130 on 16 April. On 7 May, Stade Reims made their return to Ligue 2 after one season in the Championnat National following a convincing 4\u20132 win over Luzenac. With Troyes drawing with Cannes the same day, Reims' second-place position and promotion was secured. The following week, the final club in National achieved promotion to Ligue 2 with Troyes' 2\u20130 win over Cassis Carnoux. Teams relegated to Ligue 2 * Le Mans * Boulogne * Grenoble Teams promoted to Ligue 2 * \u00c9vian * Reims * Troyes === Stadia and locations === After earning promotion to Ligue 2 for the 2010\u201311 season, \u00c9vian were rumored to be pursuing a move to play their home matches at the Stade de la Praille in Geneva, Switzerland after it was determined that their current facility, the Stade Joseph-Moynat, did not meet the Ligue de Football Professionnel's standards. Thonon-les-Bains, the commune where the club situates itself, is a few kilometers from the Swiss border and is only , a 45-minute car drive, from the city of Geneva. It was reported that the club's president, Patrick Trotignon, had been in the process of advocating for the move since the beginning of the 2009\u201310 Championnat National season just in case the club had achieved promotion to the second division. The vice- president of Swiss club Servette FC, who occupy the stadium, questioned the move citing possible schedule conflicts, as well as the health of the pitch if both clubs were to use the stadium on a weekly basis. However, his claims were refuted by Beno\u00eet Genecand, who serves as president of Fondation du Stade de Gen\u00e8ve (FSG), which owns and operates the facility. The club responded immediately to Genecand's comments via a press release posted on the club's official website. \u00c9vian petitioned to the State Council of Geneva and obtained approval from the LFP for the move in early May. On 20 May 2010, \u00c9vian received a favorable ruling from the French Football Federation with the Federal Council voting in favor of the move. According to the federation, the move now had to be agreed upon by a UEFA executive committee, which is composed of seventeen officials. On 8 June, UEFA officially denied \u00c9vian's request to play at the Stade de la Praille meaning the club will likely play its home matches at the Parc des Sports in nearby Annecy. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
