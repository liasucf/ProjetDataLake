    "text": "Sir Ralph Gore, 4th Baronet (c. 1675 \u2013 23 February 1733) was a Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He is now chiefly remembered for building Belle Isle Castle. The Gore Baronetcy, of Magherabegg in the County of Donegal, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 2 February 1622 for Paul Gore (shown also as 1st baronet of Manor Gore, the Anglicized version). Ralph was the eldest son of Sir William Gore, 3rd Baronet and his wife Hannah Hamilton, daughter and co-heiress of James Hamilton of Manorhamilton and niece of Gustavus Hamilton, 1st Viscount Boyne. Ralph inherited the estate of Manorhamilton from his mother. He was appointed High Sheriff of Leitrim for 1710. The fourth Baronet served as Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer and as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He represented Donegal Borough in the Irish House of Commons from 1703 until 1713 and then Donegal County from 1713 until 1727. Subsequently, he sat for Clogher until his death in 1733. ==Family== He married firstly Elizabeth Colville, daughter of Sir Robert Colville of Newtown, County Leitrim, and secondly, Elizabeth Ashe, daughter of St George Ashe, Bishop of Clogher and his wife (and distant cousin) Jane St George, daughter of Sir George St George of Dunmore, County Galway and Elizabeth Hannay. By his first wife he had two daughters. By his second wife he had seven children, including St George Gore-St George, who succeeded to the baronetcy, but died young without issue, Ralph Gore, 1st Earl of Ross, Richard, father of Sir Ralph Gore, 7th baronet, and Elizabeth, who married James Daly and had issue, including the judge St George Daly and the politician Denis Daly. His grandfather had acquired Belle Island in Lough Erne: it was Ralph who built the castle, which was extended and improved by his son, the younger Ralph. The present holder of the baronetcy lives in Australia. ==References== Category:1670s births Category:1733 deaths Category:18th-century Anglo-Irish people Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland Category:High Sheriffs of Leitrim Category:Irish MPs 1703\u20131713 Category:Irish MPs 1713\u20131714 Category:Irish MPs 1715\u20131727 Category:Irish MPs 1727\u20131760 Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer of Ireland Category:Speakers of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Ralph Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Donegal constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Tyrone constituencies ",
