The Nunn Center for Oral History is part of the University of Kentucky Libraries Special Collections division. ==History== The oral history program at the University of Kentucky Libraries was established in 1973 by Charles Atcher. The Center is named after former Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn. From 1974 until 2005, the program was directed by Terry Birdwhistell, Ed.D. followed by Jeffrey Suchanek. Since 2008, the Nunn Center has been directed by Doug Boyd, Ph.D. ==Collection== The Nunn Center contains over 8,000 interviews featuring a variety of individuals and projects.

Kelly Veterans Oral History Project, University of Kentucky history, African American history in Kentucky, Kentucky writers, Kentucky's medical history, the history of professional baseball, as well as more recent project featuring the Horse Industry in Kentucky, as well as on the Kentucky General Assembly. ==Digitization== The Nunn Center has aggressively undertaken efforts to digitize its collection. ===Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS)=== In 2008, the Nunn Center launched the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS) online interface that synchronizes searchable text to audio and video. This system, designed by director Doug Boyd in partnership with Digital Library Services from the United Kingdom, allows users to link from their search results tom the corresponding moments in the interview.
