    "text": "Rester vrai is a 1994 album recorded by French singer Florent Pagny. It was his third studio album and was released in March 1994. It achieved moderate success in France where it remained charted for 39 weeks in the top 50, including a peak at #19 for two weeks. For the first time in Pagny's career, lyrics were written by other artists such as Jean-Jacques Goldman who participated under the pseudonym of Sam Brewski. This album provided two singles : the unsuccessful \"Est-ce que tu me suis ?\" (#45 in France) and the hit single \"Si tu veux m'essayer\" (#7 in France), which was recorded as \"If You Want to Know Me\" in 2009 by the Belgian singer Dana Winner for the album \"Between Now and Tomorrow\" with English lyrics by Michael Leahy. The music video for the track \"Rester vrai\" was directed by Dani Jacobs and shot in London and features Pagny trapped in a glass box in a large empty space as if he is a museum exhibit or part of an experiment. ==Track listing== # \"J'irai quand m\u00eame\" # \"Si tu veux m'essayer\" # \"R\u00eave aussi le jour\" # \"Est-ce que tu me suis ?\" # \"Comme de l'eau\" # \"Rester vrai\" # \"Rappelle-toi de tes r\u00eaves\" # \"Les hommes qui doutent\" # \"Loin\" # \"Vent d'Orient\" # \"Jamais\" Source : Allmusic.Rester vrai, track listing [ Allmusic.com] (December 2, 2008) ==Releases== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\" border=\"1\" !
