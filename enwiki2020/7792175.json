The equestrian statue is standing on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo- Baroque statue was made for the town of Zenta but the town could not afford its price. The monument was bought in 1900 by the master-builder of the Royal Castle, Alajos Hauszmann as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph will be completed. This never happened so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. Other works include the statues of Zrinyi in Budapest, Bertalan Szemere, Kossuth in Miskolc and Klapka in Kom\u00e1rom (today Kom\u00e1rno, Slovakia). R\u00f3na was known to be a member of the Bencz\u00far Society. Many of his works are exhibited in the Hungarian National Gallery at Buda Palace in Budapest. ==Gallery of works== File:Budape\u0161\u0165 0470.jpg|Monument to Prince Eugene of Savoy, in front of the Royal Castle of Budapest File:Godollo - Elisabeth1.jpg|Monument to Queen Elisabeth of Hungary in the park named after her honour in G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 (1901) File:Szeged Kossuth szobor mell\u00e9kalak.jpg|Monument to Kossuth on Klauz\u00e1l Square in Szeged == External links == *K\u00e9pz\u00f5m\u00fbv\u00e9szet Magyarorsz\u00e1gon - Fine Arts in Hungary at www.hung- art.hu == References == Category:20th-century Hungarian sculptors Category:1861 births Category:1939 deaths Category:19th-century Hungarian sculptors Category:People from Fej\u00e9r County ",
