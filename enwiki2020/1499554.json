    "text": "Rapa Nui or Rapanui (),Laurie Bauer (2007), The Linguistics Student's Handbook, Edinburgh also known as Pascuan () or Pascuense, is an Eastern Polynesian language of the Austronesian language family. It is spoken on the island of Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island. The island is home to a population of just under 6,000 and is a special territory of Chile. According to census data,2002 Chilean census data there are about 3,700 people on the island and on the Chilean mainland who identify as ethnically Rapa Nui. Census data does not exist on the primary known and spoken languages among these people. In 2008, the number of fluent speakers was reported as low as 800. Rapa Nui is a minority language and many of its adult speakers also speak Spanish. Most Rapa Nui children now grow up speaking Spanish and those who do learn Rapa Nui begin learning it later in life.Makihara 2005a: p. 728 ==History== The Rapa Nui language is isolated within Eastern Polynesian, which also includes the Marquesic and Tahitic languages. Within Eastern Polynesian, it is closest to Marquesan morphologically, although its phonology has more in common with New Zealand Maori, as both languages are relatively conservative in retaining consonants lost in other Eastern Polynesian languages. Like all Polynesian languages, Rapa Nui has relatively few consonants. Uniquely for an Eastern Polynesian language, Rapa Nui has preserved the original glottal stop of Proto-Polynesian. It is, or until recently was, a verb-initial language. One of the most important recent books written about the language of Rapa Nui is Ver\u00f3nica du Feu's Rapanui (Descriptive Grammar) (). Very little is known about the Rapa Nui language prior to European contact. The majority of Rapa Nui vocabulary is inherited directly from Proto\u2013Eastern Polynesian. Due to extensive borrowing from Tahitian there now often exist two forms for what was the same word in the early language. For example, Rapa Nui has Tahitian \ua78cite alongside original tike\ua78ca for 'to see', both derived from Proto-Eastern Polynesian *kite\ua78ca. There are also hybridized forms of words such as haka\ua78cite 'to teach', from native haka (causative prefix) and Tahitian \ua78cite. ===Language notes from 1770 and 1774=== Spanish notes from a 1770 visit to the island record 94 words and terms. Many are clearly Polynesian, but several are not easily recognizable.Heyerdahl, Thor. Easter Island \u2013 The Mystery Solved. Random House New York 1989. For example, the numbers from one to ten seemingly have no relation to any known language. They are compared with contemporary Rapa Nui words, in parenthesis: # coj\u00e0na (katahi) # corena (karua) # cogoj\u00f9 (katoru) # quirote (kaha) # majan\u00e0 (karima) # te\u00f9to (kaono) # tej\u00e8a (kahitu) # moroqui (kavau) # vijoviri (kaiva) # queromata-pa\u00f9paca quacaxixiva (kaangaahuru) It may be that the list is a misunderstanding, and the words not related to numbers at all. The Spanish may have shown Arabic numerals to the islanders who did not understand their meaning, and likened them to some other abstraction. For example, the \"moroqui\" for number eight (8) would have actually been \"moroki\", a small fish that is used as a bait, since \"8\" can look like a simple drawing of a fish.See Revista Espa\u00f1ola del Pac\u00edfico. Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Estudios del Pac\u00edfico (A.E.E.P.). N.\u00ba3. A\u00f1o III. Enero- Diciembre 1993. See also online version. Captain James Cook visited the island four years later, and had a Tahitian interpreter with him, who, while recognizing some Polynesian words (up to 17 were written down), was not able to converse with the islanders in general. The British also attempted to record the numerals and were able to record the correct Polynesian words. ===Post-Peruvian enslavement=== In the 1860s the Peruvian slave raids began. It was at this time that Peruvians were experiencing labor shortages and they came to regard the Pacific as a vast source of free labor. Slavers raided islands as far away as Micronesia, but Easter Island was much closer and became a prime target. In December 1862 eight Peruvian ships landed their crewmen and between bribery and outright violence they captured some 1,000 Easter Islanders, including the king, his son, and the ritual priests (one of the reasons for so many gaps in knowledge of the ancient ways). It has been estimated that a total of 2,000 Easter Islanders were captured over a period of years. Those who survived to arrive in Peru were poorly treated, overworked, and exposed to diseases. Ninety percent of the Rapa Nui died within one or two years of capture. Eventually the Bishop of Tahiti caused a public outcry and an embarrassed Peru rounded up the few survivors to return them. A shipload headed to Easter Island, but smallpox broke out en route and only 15 arrived at the island. They were put ashore. The resulting smallpox epidemic nearly wiped out the remaining population. In the aftermath of the Peruvian slave deportations in the 1860s, Rapa Nui came under extensive outside influence from neighbouring Polynesian languages such as Tahitian. While the majority of the population that was taken to work as slaves in the Peruvian mines died of diseases and bad treatment in the 1860s, hundreds of other Easter Islanders who left for Mangareva in the 1870s and 1880s to work as servants or labourers adopted the local form of Tahitian-Pidgin. Fischer argues that this pidgin became the basis for the modern Rapa Nui language when the surviving part of the Rapa Nui immigrants on Mangareva returned to their almost deserted home island. ===Language notes from 1886=== William J. Thomson, paymaster on the USS Mohican, spent twelve days on Easter Island from 19 to 30 December 1886. Among the data Thomson collected was the Rapa Nui calendar. ===Language notes from the twentieth century=== Father Sebastian Englert,Online biography of Sebastian Englert as hosted by Minnesota State University. a German missionary living on Easter Island during 1935\u20131969, published a partial Rapa Nui\u2013Spanish dictionary in his La Tierra de Hotu Matu\ua78ca in 1948, trying to save what was left of the old language. Despite the many typographical mistakes, the dictionary is valuable, because it provides a wealth of examples which all appear drawn from a real corpus, part oral traditions and legends, part actual conversations.Englert's online dictionary with Spanish translated to English. Englert recorded vowel length, stress, and glottal stop, but was not always consistent, or perhaps the misprints make it seem so. He indicated vowel length with a circumflex, and stress with an acute accent, but only when it does not occur where expected. The glottal stop is written as an apostrophe, but is often omitted. The velar nasal is sometimes transcribed with a , but sometimes with a Greek eta, , as a graphic approximation of . ===Rongorongo=== Part of a line of rongorongo script. It is assumed that rongorongo, the undeciphered script of Easter Island, represents the old Rapa Nui language.Rongorongo connections to Rapa Nui. ==Hispanisation== The island is under the jurisdiction of Chile and is now home to a number of Chilean continentals most of whom speak only Spanish. The influence of the Spanish language is noticeable in modern Rapa Nui speech. As fewer children learn to speak Rapa Nui at an early age, their superior knowledge of Spanish affects the 'passive knowledge' they have of Rapa Nui. A version of Rapa Nui interspersed with Spanish nouns, verbs and adjectives has become a popular form of casual speech.Makihara 2005aMakihara 2005b The most well integrated borrowings are the Spanish conjunctions o (or), pero (but) and y (and). Spanish words such as problema (problem), which was once rendered as poroborema, are now often integrated with minimal or no change.Pagel 2008: p. 175 Spanish words are still often used within Rapa Nui grammatical rules, though some word order changes are occurring and it is argued that Rapa Nui may be undergoing a shift from VSO to the Spanish SVO. This example sentence was recorded first in 1948 and again in 2001 and its expression has changed from VSO to SVO.Pagel 2008: p. 176 ::'They both suffer and weep\" :1948: he \ua78caroha, he tatagi ararua :2001: ararua he \ua78caroha he tatagi Easter Island's indigenous Rapa Nui toponymy has survived with few Spanish additions or replacements, a fact that has been attributed in part to the survival of the Rapa Nui language.Latorre 2001: p. 129 This contrasts with the toponymy of continental Chile, which has lost most of its indigenous names. ==Phonology== Rapa Nui has ten consonants and five vowels. ===Consonants=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center |- ! ! Labial ! Alveolar ! Velar ! Glottal |- ! Nasal |// \u27e8m\u27e9 |// \u27e8n\u27e9 |// \u27e8\u014b\u27e9 | |- ! Stop |// \u27e8p\u27e9 |// \u27e8t\u27e9 |// \u27e8k\u27e9 |// \u27e8\ua78c\u27e9 |- ! Fricative |// \u27e8v\u27e9 | | |// \u27e8h\u27e9 |- ! Flap | |// \u27e8r\u27e9 | | |} As present generation Rapa Nui speak Spanish as their first language in younger years and learn Rapa Nui later in life, flap in word-initial position can be pronounced alveolar trill . ===Vowels=== :{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- ! ! Front ! Central ! Back |- ! High | i | | u |- ! Mid | e | | o |- ! Low | | a | |} All vowels can be either long or short and are always long when they are stressed in the final position of a word. Most vowel sequences are present, with the exception of *uo. The only sequence of three identical vowels is eee ('yes'). ==Orthography== Written Rapa Nui uses the Latin script. The Latin alphabet for Rapa Nui consists of 20 letters: A, \u0100, E, \u0112, H, I, \u012a, K, M, N, \u014a, O, \u014c, P, R, T, U, \u016a, V, \ua78c The nasal velar consonant is generally written with the Latin letter , but occasionally as . In electronic texts, the glottal plosive may be written with an 'okina to avoid the problems of using a straight apostrophe . A special letter, , is sometimes used to distinguish the Spanish , occurring in introduced terms, from the Rapa Nui . Similarly, has been written to distinguish it from Spanish g. The IPA letter is now also coming into use. ==Morphology== ===Syllable structure=== Syllables in Rapa Nui are CV (consonant-vowel) or V (vowel). There are no consonant clusters or word-final consonants. ===Reduplication=== The reduplication of whole nouns or syllable parts performs a variety of different functions within Rapa Nui. To describe colours for which there is not a predefined word, the noun for an object of a like colour is duplicated to form an adjective. For example: :* \ua78cehu (mist) \u2192 \ua78cehu \ua78cehu = dark grey :* tea (dawn) \u2192 tea tea = white Besides forming adjectives from nouns, the reduplication of whole words can indicate a multiple or intensified action. For example: :* hatu (weave) \u2192 hatuhatu (fold) :* kume (undo) \u2192 kumekume (take to pieces) :* ruku (dive) \u2192 rukuruku (go diving) There are some apparent duplicate forms for which the original form has been lost. For example: :* rohirohi (tired) The reduplication of the initial syllable in verbs can indicate plurality of subject or object. In this example the bolded section represents the reduplication of a syllable which indicates the plurality of the subject of a transitive verb: :\ua78cori (dance): ::E \ua78cori ro \ua78ca (he/she/they is/are dancing) ::E \ua78co\ua78cori ro \ua78ca (they are all dancing) The reduplication of the final two syllables of a verb indicates plurality or intensity. In this example the bolded section represents the reduplication of two final syllables, indicating intensity or emphasis: :Ha\ua78caki (tell): ::Ka ha\ua78caki (Tell the story) ::Ka ha\ua78caki\ua78caki (Tell the whole story) ===Loanwords=== Rapa Nui incorporates a number of loanwords in which constructions such as consonant clusters or word- final consonants occur, though they do not occur naturally in the language. Historically, the practice was to transliterate unfamiliar consonants, insert vowels between clustered consonants and append word-final vowels where necessary. :e.g.: Britain (English loanword) \u2192 Peretane (Rapa Nui rendering) More recently, loanwords \u2013 which come primarily from Spanish \u2013 retain their consonant clusters. For example, \"litro\" (litre). ==Syntax== ===Word order=== Rapa Nui is a VSO (verb\u2013subject\u2013object) language. Except where verbs of sensing are used, the object of a verb is marked by the relational particle i. :e.g.: He hakahu koe i te rama (the relational particle and object are bolded) ::\"You light the torch\" Where a verb of sensing is used, the subject is marked by the agentive particle e. :e.g.: He tikea e au te poki (the agentive particle and subject are bolded) ::\"I can see the child\" ===Pronoun=== Pronouns are usually marked for number: in Rapa Nui there are markers for first, second and third personal singular and plural; however, there is only a marker for dual in the first person. The first person dual and plural can mark for exclusive and inclusive. The pronouns are always ahead of the person singular (PRS) 'a' and relational particle (RLT) 'i' or dative (DAT) 'ki'. However, in some examples, they do not have PRS, RLT and DAT. There is only one paradigm of pronouns for Rapa Nui. They function the same in both subject and object cases. Here is the table for the pronoun forms in Rapa Nui: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! abbreviations !! grammatical interpretations !! Rapa Nui forms |- | 1s || 1st-person singular || au |- | 2s || 2nd-person singular || koe |- | 3s || 3rd-person singular || ia |- | 1de || 1st-person dual exclusive || m\u0101ua |- | 1di || 1st-person dual inclusive || t\u0101ua |- | 1pe || 1st-person plural exclusive || m\u0101tou |- | 1pi || 1st-person plural inclusive || t\u0101tou |- | 2p || 2nd-person non-singular || k\u014drua |- | 3p || 3rd-person non-singular || r\u0101ua |} :e.g. (1) Du Fu 1996 {| |- | Ko || au || e || noho || mai || ena || hokotahi || no |- | PFT || 1s || STA || stay || TOW || PPD || alone || LIM |} 'I live here all alone' :e.g. (2) Du Fu 1996 pp.123 {| |- | He || haka || ai || i || a || ia || he || suerkao |- | ACT || CAUS || EX || RLT || PRS || 3s || \u00b1SPE || governor |} 'They made him governor' ====Abbreviations used==== ACT \u2013 action CAUS \u2013 causative EX \u2013 existential LIM \u2013 limitative PFT \u2013 perfect tense PPD \u2013 postpositive determinant PRS \u2013 person singular RLT \u2013 relational particle STA \u2013 state (verbal) \u00b1SPE \u2013 +/- specific TOW \u2013 towards subject ===Questions=== Yes/no questions are distinguished from statements chiefly by a particular pattern of intonation. Where there is no expectation of a particular answer, the form remains the same as a statement. A question expecting an agreement is preceded by hoki. ===Conjunction=== Original Rapa Nui has no conjunctive particles. Copulative, adversative and disjunctive notions are typically communicated by context or clause order. Modern Rapa Nui has almost completely adopted Spanish conjunctions rather than rely on this. ===Possession=== ====Alienable and inalienable possession ==== In the Rapa Nui language, there are alienable and inalienable possession. Lichtemberk described alienable possession as the possessed noun being contingently associated with the possessor, and on the other hand inalienable possession as the possessed noun being necessarily associated with the possessor. The distinction is marked by a possessive suffix inserted before the relevant pronoun. Possessive particles: * a (alienable) expresses dominant possession Alienable possession is used to refer to a person's spouse, children, food, books, work, all animals (except horses), all tools and gadgets (including refrigerators), and some illnesses. e.g. (1) {| |- | E || tunu || au || i || te || kai || mo || ta\ua78caku || ga || poki || ko || maruaki || \ua78ca |- | STA || cook || 1sg || RLT || +SPE || food || BEN || POS.1sg.al || GRP || child || PFT || hungry || RES |} 'I must cook dinner for my children who are hungry' poki 'children' is an alienable possession therefore a is used to indicate that in this sentence, therefore the possessive pronoun \"ta'aku\" is used instead of \"to'oku\" *o (inalienable) expresses the subordinate possession It is used with parents, siblings, house, furniture, transports (including carts, cars, scooters, boats, airplanes), clothes, feeling, native land, parts of the body (including mind), horses, and their bridles. e.g. (2) {| |- | He || agi || na || bo\ua78ci || he || taina || \ua78co\ua78coku |- | STA || true || LIM || EMP || -SPE || sibling || POS.1sg.inal. |} 'It is true apparently, he is my brother.' Inalienable possession o is used in this example, therefore \"'o'oku\" instead of \"'a'aku\" is used. It is talking about the speaker's brother, which is an inalienable relation. There are no markers to distinguish between temporary or permanent possession; the nature of objects possessed; or between past, present or future possession. ====A and O possession ==== A and O possession refer to alienable and inalienable possession in Rapa Nui. a marks for alienable possession and o marks for inalienable possession. a and o are marked as suffixes of the possessive pronouns; however, they are only marked when the possessive pronoun is in the first, second or third person singular. In (2) above, taina 'sibling' is inalienable and the possessor is first person singular \ua78co\ua78coku 'my'. However, for all the other situations, a and o are not marked as a suffix of the possessor. {| | He | vanaga | maua | o | te | me\ua78ce | era |- | ATC | talk | 1de | POS | +SPE | thing | PPD |} 'We'll talk about those matters.' In the above example, the possessor me\ua78ce 'those' is not a possessive pronoun of the first, second or third person singular. Therefore, o is marked not as a suffix of the possessor but a separate word in the sentence. ====Classifiers==== There are no classifiers in the Rapa Nui language. ====Abbreviations used==== BEN- benefactive EMP-emphasis GRP- group plural LIM - limitative POS1sa- possessive 1st person singular alienable POS1si - possessive 1st person singular inalienable POS - possession PPD- postpositive determinant PFT - perfect tense RES - resultative RLT-relational particle +/- SPE - +/- specific STA- state (verbal) ===Exclamation=== Ko and ka are exclamatory indicators. :Ko suggests a personal reaction: ::Ko te aroha (Poor thing!) :Ka suggests judgement on external events: ::Ka ha\ua78caki\ua78caki (Tell the whole story!) ===Compound words=== Terms which did not exist in original Rapa Nui were created via compounding: :patia ika = ('spear fish') = harpoon :patia kai = ('spear food') = fork :kiri va\ua78ce = ('skin foot') = shoe :manu patia =('bird spear') = wasp :pepe hoi = ('stool horse') = saddle :pepe noho =('stool stay') = chair === Negation === In Rapa Nui, negation is indicated by free standing morphemes. Rapa Nui has four main negators: :\ua78cina (neutral) :kai (perfective) :(e)ko (imperfective) :ta\ua78ce (constituent negator) Additionally there are also two additional particles/ morphemes which also contribute to negation in Rapa Nui: :kore (Existential/noun negator) :hia / ia (verb phrase particle which occurs in combination with different negators to form the meaning 'not yet') Negation occurs as preverbal particles in the verb phrase, with the clausal negator kai and (e)ko occurring in first position in the verbal phrase, while the constituent negator (ta\ua78ce) occurs in second position in the verbal phrase. Clausal negators occur in the same position as aspect markers and subordinators\u2014this means it is impossible for these elements to co-occur. As a result, negative clauses tend to have fewer aspectual distinctions. Hia occurs in eighth position as a post-verbal marker. Verbal negators precede adjectives. The table below roughly depicts the positions of negators in the Verb Phrase: ==== Position in the verb phrase ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |1 |2 |VERB |8 |- | (kai / eko) |determiner | |hia |- |Aspect marker | (ta\ua78ce) | | |- |subordinator |numeral | | |} ==== Clausal negators ==== ===== \ua78cIna ===== \ua78cIna is the neutral negator (regarding aspect). It has the widest range of use in a variety of contexts. It usually occurs in imperfective contexts, as well as habitual clauses and narrative contexts, and is used to negate actions and states. It almost always occurs clause initially and is always followed by the neutral aspectual he + noun or he + verb. {| |34) \ua78cIna |he |ma\ua78ceha |mo |u\ua78ci |iga |i |te |kai |- | | |light |for |see | | | |food |} 'There was no light to see the food.' [R352.070] In the example above \ua78cina is followed by the combination of he+ ma\ua78ceha (noun) {| |103) \ua78cIna |he |take\ua78ca |rahi |i |te |tagata |- | | |see |many/much | | |man |} 'He did not see many people.' [R459.003] In this example, \ua78cina is followed by he + take\ua78ca (verb) In addition to negating verbal and nominal clauses, it also functions as the term \ua78cno\ua78cas shown below: {| |27) \u00bf\ua78cIna |he |pepe?... |- | | |chair... |} 'There were no chairs?...' [R413.635] Unlike the other two clausal negators (which are preverbal particles), \ua78cina is a phrase head, thus it can form a constituent of its own. ===== Kai ===== Kai negates clauses with perfective aspects. {| |74) kai |\ua78cite |a |au |ko |ai |a |ia |- | |know | | | |who | | |} 'I don't know who she is.' [R413.356] It is used to negate past events and narrative events, and is usually combined with \ua78cina. It is also used to negate stative verbs, and a verb phrase marked with kai may contain various post-verbal particles such as the continuity marker \ua78c\u00e2 / \ua78cana. This marker occurs when the clause has perfect aspect (often obligatory with the perfect marker ko). When combined with kai, it indicates that the negative state continues. {| |45) Kai |ha\ua78camata |a |au |kai |pa\ua78co |\ua78c\u00e2 |e |tahi |miro |- | |begin | |1SG | |chop | | |one |tree |} 'I haven't yet started to chop down a tree.' [R363.091] ===== (E)ko ===== (E)ko is the imperfective negator, which (like kai) replaces the aspectual marker in front of the verb, and which can occur with the negator \ua78cina. {| class=\"mw-collapsible\" |107) \ua78cIna |e |ko |kai |i |te |kahi |o |t\u00f4\ua78cona |vaka |- | | | |eat | | |tuna |of | |boat |} '(The fisherman) would not eat the tune (caught with) his boat.' [Ley-5-27.013] It marks negative commands in imperatives (usually with \ua78cina) with the e often excluded in imperatives. {| |39) \ua78cIna |ko |kai |i |te |kai |mata |- | | |eat | | |food |raw |} 'Don't eat raw food.' (Weber 2003b:610) In other contexts, especially when \ua78cina is absent, the e is obligatory. {| |132) \u00bfE |ko |haga |\ua78c\u00f4 |koe |mo |\ua78cori |o |T\u00e2ua? |- | | |want |really | |for |dance |of | |} 'Don't you want to dance with me (lit. us to dance)?' [R315.115] ==== Constituent negator ==== ===== Ta\ua78ce ===== Ta\ua78ce is a constituent negator used to negate anything other than a main clause. This can be subordinate clauses, prepositional phrases, possessive predicates and other non-verbal clauses. It also negates nominalised verbs and sub-constituents such as adjectives and quantifiers. It does not negate nouns (this is done by the noun negator kore). It is also used to negate locative phrases, actor emphasis constructions, and is also used to reinforce the preposition mai. {| |152) \ua78cI |au |he |oho |r\u00f4 |\ua78cai |mai |ta\ua78ce |p\u00f4 |- | | | |go | | |from | |night |} 'I'm going now, before it gets dark.' [R153.042] Ta\ua78ce is an indicator for subordinate clauses, as it can also negate subordinate clauses without subordinate markers (in which case it usually occurs with an aspect marker). {| |17) \ua78cI |te |ta\ua78ce |hakarogo, |he |garo |r\u00f4 |atu |\ua78cai |- |at | | |listen | |lost | |away | |} 'Because (the sheep) did not listen, it got lost.' [R490.005] It also occurs in main clauses with main clause negators and aspect markers i and e, when the clause has a feature of a subordinate clause such as oblique constituents ==== Noun negator: kore ==== kore is a verb meaning 'the absence or lack of something'. {| |164) He |u\ua78ci |ku |kore |\ua78c\u00e2 |te |tagi |- | |look | |lack | | |cry |} 'He looked (at his wife); the crying was over.' [Ley-9-55.076] It immediately follows the noun in the adjective position, and is used to indicate that the entity expressed by the noun or noun modifier does not exist or is lacking in the given context. {| |166) Te |\ua78cati |he |matariki |kore |mo |oro |o |r\u00e2 |hora |- | |problem | |file |lack |for |grate |of | |time |} 'The problem was the lack of files to sharpen (the fishhooks) at the time.' [R539-1.335] ==== Hia / ia ==== Hia / ia is a morpheme used immediately after negated verbs and co- occurs with a negator to indicate actions or events which are interrupted or are yet to happen. {| |57) kai |oromatu\ua78ca |hia |i |oho |r\u00f4 |mai |era |ki |nei |- | |priest |yet | |go | |hither | |to | |} 'When he had not yet become a priest, he came here.' [R423.004] ==== Double negation ==== In Rapa Nui, double negation is more frequent than single negation (with the negator \ua78cina often co-occurring with another clause negator most of the time). It is often used as a slight reinforcement or emphasis. \ua78cIna can be combined with negators kai and (e)ko- both of these are main clause negators. {| |17) \u00a1 Ka |rua |\ua78c\u00f4 |mahana |\ua78cina |kai |tu\ua78cu |mai! |- | |two |really |day | | |arrive |hither |} 'She hasn't come for two days.' [R229.132] In the example above we see the negator \ua78cina co-occurring with the perfective negator kai. When ta\ua78ce occurs in double negation, if the other negator is kai or (e)ko, the negative polarity is cancelled out. {| |161) kai |ta\ua78ce |haka |\ua78cite |ko |ai |a |ia |hai |me\ua78ce |rivariva |aga |- | | | |know | |who | | | |thing |good: |do |} '(God) did not fail to make known who he is, by the good things he did.' (Acts 14:17) \ua78cIna only negates main clauses so it never combines with the negator ta\ua78ce, which is a subordinate clause negator. When occurring with \ua78cina, negation may be reinforced. {| |162) ....\ua78cina |e |ko |ta\ua78ce |rava\ua78ca |te |ika |- | | | | |obtain | |fish |} '(if the mother does not eat the fish caught by her firstborn son), he will not fail to catch fish.' [Ley-5-27.008] Double negation occurs very frequently in imperatives in particular. {| |82) \ua78cIna |ko |oho |ki |te |t\u00eatahi |kona |- | | |go |to | |some/other |place |} 'Don't go to another place.' [R161.027] ==Numerals== There is a system for the numerals 1\u201310 in both Rapa Nui and Tahitian, both of which are used, though all numbers higher than ten are expressed in Tahitian. When counting, all numerals whether Tahitian or Rapanui are preceded by 'ka'. This is not used however, when using a number in a sentence. :Rapa Nui Numerals 1-10: :(ka) tahi :(ka) rua :(ka) toru :(ka) ha :(ka) rima :(ka) ono :(ka) hitu :(ka) va\ua78cu/varu :(ka) iva :(ka) agahuru ==Footnotes== ==References== *Chilean Census 2002 * * * * * * *Pagel, S., 2008.
