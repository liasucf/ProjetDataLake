    "text": "\"Pie Jesu\" (original Latin: Pie Iesu) is a text from the final couplet of the hymn, \"Dies irae\", and often included in musical settings of the Requiem Mass as a motet. ==Popular settings== Marc-Antoine Charpentier has composed four \"Pie Jesu\": H 427 (1675), H 234 (1670), H 263 (1690), H 269 (1695 ?). The settings of the Requiem Mass by Luigi Cherubini, Gabriel Faur\u00e9, Maurice Durufl\u00e9, John Rutter, Karl Jenkins, Kim Andr\u00e9 Arnesen and Fredrik Sixten include a \"Pie Jesu\" as an independent movement. Of all these, by far the best known is the \"Pie Jesu\" from Faur\u00e9's Requiem. Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns said of Faur\u00e9's \"Pie Jesu\" that \"Just as Mozart's is the only 'Ave verum corpus', this is the only 'Pie Jesu'.\"Steinberg, Michael. \"Gabriel Faur\u00e9: Requiem, Op. 48.\" Choral Masterworks: A Listener's Guide. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, 131\u2013137. Andrew Lloyd Webber's setting of \"Pie Jesu\" in his Requiem (1985) has also become well known and has been widely recorded. ==Text== The original text, derived from the \"Dies irae\" sequence, is as follows: {| |Pie Jesu Domine, Dona eis requiem. (\u00d72) Pie Jesu Domine, Dona eis requiem sempiternam. |Pious Lord Jesus, Give them rest. Pious Lord Jesus, Give them everlasting rest. |} ===Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem=== Andrew Lloyd Webber, in his Requiem, combined the text of the \"Pie Jesu\" with the version of the \"Agnus Dei\" from the Tridentine Requiem Mass: {| |Pie Jesu, (\u00d74) Qui tollis peccata mundi, Dona eis requiem. (\u00d72) Agnus Dei, (\u00d74) Qui tollis peccata mundi, Dona eis requiem, (\u00d72) Sempiternam (\u00d72) Requiem. |Pious Jesus, Who takes away the sins of the world, Give them rest. Lamb of God, Who takes away the sins of the world, Give them rest, Everlasting Rest. |} == References == ==External links== *, Philippe Jaroussky, Orchestre de Paris, Paavo J\u00e4rvi *, Hayley Westenra Category:Latin-language Christian hymns Category:Latin religious words and phrases Category:Songs about Jesus ",
