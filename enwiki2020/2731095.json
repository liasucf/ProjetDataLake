    "text": "Time Requiem is a Swedish neoclassical power metal band created by Richard Andersson in 2001.\"Time Requiem,\" Encyclopaedia Metallum. Web, Sep. 11, 2010. Andersson created the band that summer, when he felt that his previous project - Majestic - had come to a dead end. ==Biography== Andersson took Peter Wildoer, Apollo Papathanasio and Magnus Nord with him to his new band. Martin Wezovski turned out to be too inexperienced to be able to play the bass in the band and was replaced by Dick L\u00f6vgren (Meshuggah). They produced their first self-titled album, in 2002 . In 2003, Andersson and the rest of the band played in Japan. This concert was recorded and released on a live CD. Unleashed In Japan contained some songs from Time Requiem, but also had some new material. Afterwards, Wildoer became preoccupied with death metal band Darkane, and left Time Requiem to focus more on his own project. L\u00f6vgren and Andersson were having issues in regards to their musical differences, and also left. They were later replaced by Zoltan Cs\u00f6rsz and Jonas Reingold. With this lineup, a new album was made. It was given the name The Inner Circle of Reality. ==Line-up== *Richard Andersson - keyboards *G\u00f6ran Edman - vocals *Magnus Nilsson - guitars *Andy Rose - bass *J\u00f6rg Andrews - drums ==Former members== *Peter Wildoer - drums *Apollo Papathanasio - vocals *Magnus Nord - guitars *Zoltan Cs\u00f6rsz - drums *Jonas Reingold - bass *Dick L\u00f6vgren - bass ==Discography== *Time Requiem (2002) *Unleashed In Japan (2003) *The Inner Circle of Reality (2004) *Optical Illusion (2006) ==References== ==External links== *Homepage of Andersson's projects *Profile page at their record label *An interview with Andersson Category:Swedish heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Swedish power metal musical groups ",
