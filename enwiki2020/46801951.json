After the migration of peoples of the late antiquity tribes also dominated areas on the Iberian Peninsula, so the Kingdom of the Suevi (from 409) and the Visigothic kingdom (beginning with the second half of the 5th century). From 711, much of Spain came under Muslim Rule. Only Karl Martell, king of the Frankish Empire, which at that time included common French and German territories, was able to expand the [Moorish] advancing from Spain to south-west France through the Battle of Tours and Poitiers. Only in the north of the Iberian peninsula were Christian empires able to assert themselves. From there began from 722 until 1492 continuing Spanish Reconquista. === Alfons X. === Alfonso X of Castile (Illustration from the Libro de los juegos , 1251-1282) Also Alfonso X., King of Le\u00f3n and Castile from 1252 to 1282, led a crusade against the Moors. This ruler was from 1257 to 1273 also King Counter-King of Holy Roman Empire, which was related to his mother: His descent from the German family of Hohenstaufen Hohenstaufen through his mother Elisabeth, a daughter of the king Philipp von Schwaben, gave him the right to represent the Swabian line. The election of Elector in 1257, after the death of William of Holland in 1256, in which he received the same number of votes (both three votes) as the opponent Richard of Cornwall, seduced him to aim for the prestigious Kaiser crown through the Roman-German kingship; However, this was never realized, because he could not raise the necessary money for a Romzug. In order to get money, he worsened the coins and then tried to control the price increase by an idiosyncratic tax system. The retail trade in its territory was ruined, and the citizens and peasants were badly damaged. The unanimous election Rudolf I of Habsburg to the Roman-German King in 1273 actually meant Alfons' deposition as king of the Holy Roman Empire. === Karl V .: \"In my kingdom the sun never sets\" === thumb|right| Reign of Charles V. 'Burgundy:' Castile 'Red:' 'Aragon's possessions 'Orange:' Burgundian possessions 'Yellow:' Austrian hereditary land 'Pale yellow:' Holy Roman Empire The Reconquista was completed by the Catholic Kings Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II. Of Arag\u00f3n in 1492. In the same year, the Spanish sailor Christopher Columbus discovered America and laid the foundation stone for the Spanish Empire. The heir of Isabella, who died in 1504, was her son Juan. He married Margaret of Burgundy in 1496, the daughter of the later Roman-German Emperor Maximilian I, but died in 1497 without heirs. The younger sister Johanna married in 1497 the Habsburg Philipp the beautiful (1478-1506), who was also a son of Maximilian, also Duke of Burgundy. However, after showing signs of \"madness\" in the eyes of his contemporaries, Ferdinand took over. With the death of Ferdinand, the eldest son of Johanna's marriage Charles fell to the Spanish heritage. Charles V ruled over a global empire in which the sun never went down ' ; Painting by Rubens To secure the heritage, Charles concluded the Treaty of Noyon in 1516 for understanding with France.Alfred Kohler: Charles V (1519-1556). In: The emperors of modern times. Munich 1990, p. 35. In 1519, after his grandfather Maximilian had died, he was also struck by the Austrian - habsburg inheritance. He was elected Roman-German King and assumed the title \"Chosen Emperor\" at his coronation in 1520. Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England also applied for Maximilian's succession, and finally Friedrich von Sachsen, and Karl's brother Ferdinand was at times as a candidate in the conversation. The decisive factor was the financial support provided by the Fugger. The total cost of the election was 851,918 guilders, of which the Fuggers alone raised 543,585.Michael North: \"The money and its history. From the Middle Ages to the present day. Beck, Munich 1994, p. 86. In Spain, the Comuneros Uprising broke out against the reign of Karl, a foreigner, who had raised taxes to finance his wars. The insurrection was mainly supported by the bourgeoisie of the cities of Castile, in particular [Toledo]. He found support in parts of the clergy and the nobility. His goal was to limit the royal power in favor of Cortes. In the Kingdom of Valencia he came to a social revolutionary movement, the Germania. The rebels under Juan de Padilla were defeated at Villalar in 1521, the rebellion finally suppressed in 1522. After securing power, Spain became a central power base of the emperor. === Wars with France and the Ottomans (1521-1556) === At European level, the fighting between France and the Habsburgs was of great importance. For the Emperor it was dangerous, as the Pope and Venice tended increasingly to the side of France. In 1525 Charles' troops captured Francis I in the Battle of Pavia (1525).Horst Rabe: Reich und Glaubens- schaltung. Germany 1500-1600. Munich 1989, p. 152. But Karl joined the proposals for a moderate peace.Alfred Kohler: Charles V, Emperor. In: Neue Deutsche Biographie. 11 (1977), p. 196; online. This led to the signing of the Treaty of Madrid in 1526, in which France relinquished its claims in northern Italy , Karl hoped to be able to persuade Franz to fight together against the Ottomans and against the Lutherans.Horst Rabe: Reich und Glaubens- schaltung. Germany 1500-1600. Munich 1989, p. 153. But after Franz was released, he revoked the contract. He managed to win with the Holy League of Cognac from the Pope, Venice, Florence and finally even Milan allies. === Division of the Habsburg Empire, Philip II (1556-1598) === Barbara Blomberg with Emperor Charles V (wood engraving from 1894) When Charles V put down the government in 1556, Spain lost the Austrian possessions of the House of Habsburg and the imperial crown, but retained the Netherlands, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, the Duchy of Milan, and the kingdoms. Naples, Sicily and Sardinia. In 1570 his son and successor married Philip II Anna of Austria (1549-1580), the mother of the heir apparent Philipp. In the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire was an expansive major power. Venice and Spain sent a common fleet into the eastern Mediterranean, which defeated the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571. Although Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was not part of the Holy League, its Commander-in-Chief Juan de Austria, an extra-marital son of Emperor Charles V. and the bourgeois Regensburg he G\u00fcrtler s daughter Barbara Blomberg. === Spanish Succession War (1701-1714) === The extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs in 1701 triggered the Spanish Succession War. The Hague Great Alliance around the Austrian - Habsburg Emperor, the Holy Roman Empire, England and Great Britain and the Netherlands fought against France and its allies Kurk\u00f6ln, Savoy and the Electorate of Bavaria.The Duchy of Savoy was part of the Bourbon Alliance until November 8, 1703, but then switched sides and joined the Hague Grand Allianceand thus the Habsburgs. The war took an unfavorable turn for Habsburg with the death of Joseph I., but it also shook the forces of France. The Austrian house Habsburg had become under Leopold I. and Joseph I. nevertheless to the European great power. In the end, France succeeded in establishing Philip V as king of Spain. Thus the dynasty of the Bourbonen, which reigns today, was founded in Spain. Almost all the powers involved in the war had achieved at least partial successes at the end of the war. === 19th century === Leopold von Hohenzollern: Spanish succession disputes lead to the Franco- Prussian War. In 1869, the Spanish Cortes proclaimed a new constitution that envisaged a parliamentary monarchy as a form of government. A promising royal candidate was Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, scion of a Catholic branch line of Hohenzollern. He was persuaded in the spring of 1870 by Otto von Bismarck to accept the candidature. Soon Leopold resigned from his candidacy, as France threatened war. The French objection to Leopold or the French demand \"that S. Maj. The [Prussian] king committed himself for all future, never to give his consent again, if the Hohenzollern should come back to their candidature\" - as that of Otto edited by Bismarck and thus deliberately pointed Emser Depesche, led to the German-French War. The victory of Prussia and its allies resulted in 1871 in the German Unification. While Reich Chancellor Bismarck described the German Reich as \"saturated\" in order to be able to insert the new power factor in Europe's center into the Concert of the Powers, Kaiser Wilhelm II. (German Reich) demanded (Kaiser from 1888) later \"a place in the sun\" for the Germans. As part of its world power policy, Germany also came into conflict with Spain, even though it had already lost most of its colonies anyway. The 1899 forced Spain to relinquish the Carolines, the northern Mariana Islands and Palau to Germany. The South Pacific areas in Pacific then formed part of New Guinea. === 20th century === Ruins left by the bombing of Guernica in 1937, the 'Operation R\u00fcgen'. In World War I (1914-1918), Spain remained neutral, while Germany and the other Central Powers lost the war against the Triple Entente. This led to the abdication of all German monarchs. A side effect of the German defeat was that Germany failed as a rival of Spain in the struggle for colonial possessions in Morocco. The brothers Mannesmann had possession in the Moroccan Rif area, which corresponded to about one-eighth of the territory. In the Rifkrieg (1921-1926) the Spaniards tried to extend their rule to the entire colonial territory in northern Morocco. It was at the initiative of the king who wanted to exterminate the Rif Kabyles, Dirk Sasse: French, British and Germans in the Rifkrieg 1921-1926.

The inter-war period was associated with great uncertainty and instability for most European countries. Democratic ideas were threatened on the right by fascist and on the left by communist ideologies. While in the Versailles Treaty hard-hit Germany, the Weimar Republic fought for its consolidation, it came in Spain to dictatorship under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923-1930) and 1931 to proclaim the Second Spanish Republic. After the July 1936 semi-failed coup d'etat in Spain that led to the start of the 1936\u201339 Civil War, Nazi Germany (along Fascist Italy) sided with the rebels and supplied them with money, munitions and manpower, including the intervention of the Condor Legion. === Germans on the Republican side === International Militia, including Germans, fought against Franco's forces.

Famous personalities like George Orwell and the later Social Democrat Member of Parliament Peter Blachstein fought in the POUM militia units. In the massacre of M\u00e1laga on the fleeing population of the city in February 1937 about 10,000 people were murdered. In the concentration camps, medical experiments were also carried out on the prisoners with National Socialist support.Javier Bandr\u00e9s, Rafael Llavona: La psicolog\u00eda en los campos de concentraci\u00f3n de Franco.

In: Psicothema. 10,3 (1998), pp. 669-678. ([online, PDF]) In February 1939 there were nearly 500,000 civil war refugees. They were initially interned mostly in the south of France. More than half returned to Spain in the next few months. In France remained about 150,000, many of them were sent as prisoners of war in different main camp and since August 6, 1940 in the concentration camp Mauthausen. More than 7,000 Spanish prisoners lived there, 5,000 of whom died. Some Spaniards were extradited to Franco by the Gestapo, others, such as the former head of government Francisco Largo Caballero, were deported to various German concentration camps. When the last Republican forces had given up, Franco proclaimed victory on April 1, 1939, the [Francoist Francoist] dictatorship prevailed throughout Spain. === Non-belligerent during World War II === Reichsf\u00fchrer SS Heinrich Himmler with Karl Wolff at one Meeting with Franco in Spain, October 25, 1940 Although Franco unquestionably had sympathy for the fascist regime in Italy and for the National Socialist regime in Germany, remained in practice, the solidarity with his alleged ideological allies within limits. He was more likely to associate business relations with these regimes than an ideological community of fate. Spain joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in March 1939. Franco declared in July 1940 that his country was not neutral but merely a war leader and stated to Hitler in a letter dated February 1941, \"that we three men, the Duce, you and me, by the hardest compulsion of the Bernd Rill, in: Geschichte 2/2001, p. 36. Characteristic of Franco 's attitude to the Axis n, however, is his behavior in Hendaye in 1940 (thus at the height of Nazi power in Europe) on the occasion of his only meeting with Hitler, when Franco not only demanded French colonial territory for Spain's entry into the war, but also refused to allow German troops into his country to let. According to his own statements, Franco is said to have even told Hitler that Spain will fight every invader to the last man, wherever he comes from. In addition, Franco demanded the supply of raw materials such as cotton and rubber, which Germany could hardly deliver. Franco, in spite of his superficial approval, finally closed Hitler's suggestion to occupy Gibraltar, which had long been demanded by England, because that would have meant Franco's entry into the Second World War.Compare and His condolences finally consisted in sending the 'Divisi\u00f3n Azul' 'to the Eastern Front, 47,000 Falangist volunteers under General Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes, but which he withdrew in 1943 after the Battle of Stalingrad there again. In addition, Franco Germany provided, inter alia, submarine bases and news material. Adolf Hitler was dissatisfied with Franco's policy and in July 1942, in a small circle, began to consider \"finding a suitable personality for the settlement of the Spanish political situation.\" He particularly thought of General Mu\u00f1oz Grandes and said that the Blue Division might \"play a crucial role in the settlement of the current Pfaff system.\" Henry Picker: Hitler's Table Talks at F\u00fchrer Headquarters 1941-1942 Seewald Verlag, Stuttgart 1976 , p. 427f. In December 1943, Franco issued his position to the German ambassador saying that \"the attitude of the Spanish government towards Bolshevism and Communism would not change, and that this struggle would continue at home and abroad, as well as against Judaism and Freemasonry \"In 1938, the Synagogue of Madrid had been closed, the communities built in several cities during the war were dissolved again.

On the other hand, the [racial doctrine] represented by National Socialism found little echo in Spain. Roughly 20 to 35,000 European Jews were able to save themselves from the persecution via Spain. Spain and the Holocaust. Niemeyer Verlag, T\u00fcbingen 2001. Franco is said to be in favor of some of the Sephardic communities in Walther L. Bernecker: Spain's History since the Civil War. Beck, Munich 1997, p. 82. Of these Sephards, some had descendants of 1492 displaced Jews in the 1920s who can accept Spanish citizenship. Franco's involvement was limited to those Sephards, which were relatively small with 4,500 of 175,000 sephards. At the latest since 1944, Franco had been informed in detail about the extermination of the Jews in KZ Auschwitz and it turns out that he knew the exact extent of the annihilation.'Excelencia, esto ocurre en Auschwitz.' ' In:' 'El Pa\u00eds.' 'March 21, 2010. The American historian Stanley G. Payne already sees withdrawal movements of Spain from Germany and Italy, even before the turn in Russia, as already at this time an article of a Falangist leader, in which Spain was differentiated from the totalitarian regimes, was allowed to print. In 1943, this idea became common knowledge, so that by the time the Second World War came to a close, Spain was well advanced on the path of transition from a partially mobilized, semi-fascist state to a Catholic, corporate and increasingly demobilized authoritarian regime.Stanley Payne: History of fascism. Rise and Fall of a European Movement . Tosa publishing house in the publishing house Carl Ueberreuter, Vienna 2006, . P. 325\"When Franco's defeat loomed around 1943, Franco withdrew from the Axis powers. He declared Spain neutral this year and, in exchange for allied oil supplies, largely cushioned Germany's material and non-material support. He also dismissed the sympathetic members of his government, including his brother-in- law Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er. This shift allowed Franco to appease the Allies. In addition, during the Second World War, the abolition of external symbols such as the Fascist salute came. For Franco, Hitler and Mussolini were only interesting as long as they were powerful and he had something to expect from them. Another aspect, however, is that Spain, still severely weakened by the recent civil war, could not afford to participate in another gun campaign. After the war, Spain was stationed on one of the so-called rat lines, the escape routes of the dignitaries of both the Nazi regime itself and its ideological allies - often for the purpose of traveling to South America. Some of them also found refuge in Spain itself, such as L\u00e9on Degrelle, leader of the Belgian Rexists. === postwar === After the Second World War, the occupied and divided Germany initially fell out as a player on the international stage. After the victory of the Western democracies, the Spanish dictatorship was naturally isolated, which should, however, be defused by the looming Cold War for Franco. In 1955, Spain was admitted to the United Nations. In 1973, the German Democratic Republic followed as the 133rd and the Federal Republic of Germany as the 134th member. From the beginning of the 1960s, Franco sought an [association] agreement with the EC. He submitted an application on February 9, 1962. It was only in 1966 that negotiations began, which were delayed until the conclusion of a first agreement in 1970, mainly due to political reservations of the then six states (including the FRG). === After the end of the Spanish dictatorship === Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez and Helmut Kohl (1993) The Spanish isolation could only be completely broken after Franco's death in 1975 and the subsequent democratization under King Juan Carlos I. Spain joined the NATO in 1982; The Federal Republic of Germany belonged to the Atlantic Pact since 1955. In 1986 Spain became a member of the European Community and in 1988 the Western European Union. Spain also decided to use the Euro as the currency together with Germany and other European partners (1999 as book money, cash introduction 2002), so that no currency exchange between the two countries is necessary. ===21st Century=== In Iraq war in 2003, Spain joined the US despite the popular opposition of the \"[Coalition of the Willing One]\". Germany, together with Russia and France, refused to participate in the war on Saddam Hussein s. Foreign policy, however, Spain then approached again to Germany and France. Prime Minister Zapatero withdrew the troops from Iraq by July 2004, but he soon added to the military contingent in Afghanistan in view of the relations with the US damaged by the withdrawal until November 2013 34 Spaniards died. Germany and Spain jointly participated in the Security and Reconstruction Mission under [NATO] International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). === Current status === The relations between the German Federal Government and the Government of Spain are unencumbered. At the end of March 2018, Catalan politician Carles Puigdemont was arrested in Germany. The possibility of extradition is currently being examined.FAZ: Federal government defends action of Spain. == German community of Spain == See German Spaniards.
