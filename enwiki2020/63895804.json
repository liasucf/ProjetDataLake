    "text": "\"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Chris Rea, released in 1990 as the third single from his tenth studio album The Road to Hell (1989). It was written by Rea and produced by Rea and Jon Kelly. \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" reached No. 24 in the UK Singles Chart and remained in the Top 100 for six weeks. In 1994, the single was re-issued from Rea's compilation album The Best of Chris Rea. It re-charted at No. 70 in the UK in December 1994. Another re-issue in 2000 saw the song peak at No. 11 on the \u00d63 Austria Top 40 chart. ==Background== Rea was inspired to write \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" after his daughter Josie saw footage of a riot in South Africa on the news, which showed \"this horrible thing of throwing lighted tyres over people\" and \"one guy burning to death\". Rea recalled to Peter Doggett in 2019: \"Joan's [Rea's wife] dad was saying he didn't know what to say to Josie about what she'd seen, so he just said, 'That man has gone to heaven'. And that's how songs happen. I went up to see her and she was safely asleep, so I looked out the window and said to myself, 'Grandad told you there's a heaven, I'd like someone to tell me there's a heaven, too.'\" ==Critical reception== On its release, Music & Media wrote: \"A slow, gentle and intimate song with some tastefully arranged strings. Perfect for late- night and AC programmers.\" In a review of The Road to Hell, David Law of The Charlatan felt the song \"sums up both Rea's disillusionment and his hopes for the future\", but felt it would have been \"more effective shrouded in simple acoustic guitar and piano\" than the \"John Williams-type soundtrack strings\". Deborah Hornblow of the Hartford Courant described the song as a \"good track\" which \"begs questions a child would ask on seeing the world's unkindness\". John Everson of the Southtown Star considered the song to be \"astounding in emotion and lyrical sweep\". ==Track listing== ===Original release=== 7\" single # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:01 # \"And When She Smiles\" \u2013 3:11 12\" single # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:01 # \"And When She Smiles\" \u2013 3:11 # \"Curse of the Traveller\" \u2013 6:25 CD single # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:01 # \"And When She Smiles\" \u2013 3:11 # \"Curse of the Traveller\" \u2013 6:25 # \"Little Blonde Plaits\" \u2013 4:16 ===1994 release=== CD single # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:01 # \"Stainsby Girls\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Let's Dance\" \u2013 4:15 CD single (promo release) # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" (Edit) \u2013 4:55 # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" (Album Version) \u2013 6:01 # \"Stainsby Girls\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Let's Dance\" \u2013 4:15 # \"Driving Home for Christmas\" \u2013 3:58 ===2000 release=== CD single # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:01 # \"Sail Away\" \u2013 4:48 # \"Sandwriting\" \u2013 5:08 ==Personnel== Tell Me There's a Heaven * Chris Rea - vocals, guitars, keyboards * Max Middleton - keyboards, string arrangement * Robert Ahwai - bass * Martin Ditcham - drums, percussion Production * Chris Rea - producer of \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" and \"And When She Smile\", producer and mixing on \"Curse of the Traveller\", producer of \"Little Blonde Plaits\" * Jon Kelly - producer of \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\", mixing on \"Curse of the Traveller\" * Dave Richards - producer of \"And When She Smiles\" and \"Little Blonde Plaits\" * Neil Amor, Diane BJ Kon\u00e9 - engineers on \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" Other * The Leisure Process - sleeve design * Christian Charisius - back cover photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1990) !Peak position |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1994) !Peak position |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|70 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Peak position |- | Austrian Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |} ==References== Category:1989 songs Category:1990 singles Category:1994 singles Category:2000 singles Category:Chris Rea songs Category:Warner Records singles Category:East West Records singles Category:Songs written by Chris Rea ",
