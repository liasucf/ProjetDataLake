The program was based on a Japanese TBS Television series, Wakuwaku D\u014dbutsu Land (\u308f\u304f\u308f\u304f\u52d5\u7269\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9).

Host Thicke introduced a video clip about an animal; at some point, the video was paused and Thicke asked a question about the clip. The celebrities give their answers, after which the remainder of the clip was played, revealing the answer. Any celebrities giving the correct answer received a point; score was kept by placing a stuffed animal (a monkey in the first season, a hedgehog in later seasons) in front of the celebrity's podium. The celeb with the most toy animals/points won the game and $2,500 for their favorite animal charity. If a tie occurred, the money was split between the charities. On segues to two commercial breaks, a hedgehog puppet named \"Reggie the Hedgie\" (voiced by Susan Blu, performed by Lisa Sturz) gave animal facts to the home viewers and read home-viewer mail. ==International versions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
