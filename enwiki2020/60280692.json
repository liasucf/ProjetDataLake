She is the 11th of their 13 children. At age 19, Saraya moved to Jerusalem to study nursing at the Hebrew University. She began her nursing career at Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv in the oncology-hematology ward. After working in several different positions at the hospital, including training positions, she began teaching at the Sheinbein nursing college, and managed a private immunotherapy clinic. === Acting career === ==== Film and television ==== Saraya displayed talent and passion for acting from a young age, when she would \"put on shows\" for her family. But it was only in 1997, in her early twenties, that she got her first real taste of acting, when she participated in an acting workshop in a community center in Lod. The following year, Saraya moved to Tel Aviv and got involved in the fringe performance scene, through which she started performing in various styles, including drag. It was in this context that she discovered her ability to rap and worked the genre into her performances. During this period, she had not yet developed performing into a career, and made her living as a nurse. In 2008, Saraya made her first film appearance, in the short \"Gevald\". But her real breakthrough arrived in 2011, when she got one of the leading roles in the television series \"Minimum Wage \". She played Amal, one of three work-weary cleaning women. The show was a success, and won Israeli Academy of Film and Television awards for Best Drama and Best Directing in 2012, success that continued into the second season, which aired in 2014. Saraya starred in Shira Geffen's 2014 film Self Made as Nadine, alongside Sarah Adler. The film provides a mirror-image of a Jewish Israeli woman and a Palestinian woman from the occupied territories, who gradually switch places. Saraya traveled with the film to international film festivals, including Cannes International Film Festival, and the India Women's Film Festival. In 2017, Saraya played the role of Rauda in Shaby Gabizon's film, Longing. Her performance in Dana Goldberg and Efrat Mishori's 2017 film, Death of a Poetess, won Saraya the Best Actress Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival. The film tracks two simultaneous timelines, following Yasmine (Saraya), a nurse from Jaffa, and the last day in the life of Lena Sadeh (Evgenia Dodina), a world-renowned brain researcher, whose paths cross tragically. Saraya improvised the scenes in which her character was under police interrogation, a performance for which she reaped high praise from reviewers. Saraya has also played guest roles in series such as \"Fauda\" and \"Sirens\", multiple student films, and in 2018, appeared in a German-Israeli experimental film, The Valley of the Cross. Filmed in Germany, the film is the story of a lesbian love affair between two women in 1920s Palestine. Also in 2018, Saraya got the supporting role of Hudna on the hit television \"She Has It\", which has been greenlighted for a second season. In 2015, Saraya was offered the lead role in the feature film \"Samira\", about a Palestinian woman in her early forties, who is recruited to carry out a suicide bombing in Israel, but changes her mind at the last moment. Saraya turned down the role and refused to cooperate in any way in the making of the film, because she felt it was anti-Arab and Islamophobic. Saraya later published an opinion piece in the online magazine \"Ha-Makom\" about her objections to the film. In June 2015, Saraya won the best screenplay award at the Tel Aviv LGBT film festival, TLVFest. In 2016, she enrolled in the Tel Aviv University film school, planning to write and direct her first feature. In June 2017, Saraya received a grant from Gesher Foundation to produce and shoot her first short film, \"Polygraph\". ==== Theater and stage ==== Saraya is the first Palestinian drag king, performing under the stage name \"Samimo\". She began performing at parties and events of the radical queer community in 2003. Her first major stage role was in the play \"The Silwan Peacock\" (2012), in which she plays a young Arab woman who is forced to navigate among the conflicting interests of the state, illegal settlers, and the local Arab population regarding a site that becomes an archaeological dig. She received a special commendation from the jury at the Acre Festival. The play \u2013 a Golden Hedgehog award winner, and critic-favorite \u2013 is still running as of 2018. Saraya appeared in several other stage productions at the Acre festival, including Ran Bechor's \"Hutzbama\", which won Best Play. In 2016 she played a lead role in the avante- garde production \"Schreber\", which also won Best Play and showed all around the country. As a rap and spoken word artist, Saraya performs both solo and in collaboration with other artists, including Tamer Nafar, System Ali, and others. === Activism === Saraya's political and social activism began with the queer-anarchist group Black Laundry, and she was one of the founders of Aswat, the queer Palestian women's group, in which she worked to change the perception of the LGBT community in Palestinian society. She was also a part of Tel Aviv's queer political scene in the early 2000s, and one of the organizers of the Queerhana collective, which held non-profit parties for the community, in order to provide marginalized LGBT persons an alternative to the commercial, apolitical lines. The Queerhana parties and activism were documented in the film Nation Monsters and Super Queers, in which Saraya participated. In December 2018, Saraya appeared on the cover of GenderTuck magazine, which featured an interview with her in which she discusses the edition's topic \u2013 family \u2013 analyzing the concepts and meaning of birth family and chosen family. On May 7, 2019, Saraya co-hosted the joint Israeli- Palestinian Memorial Day ceremony (he), which is conducted by Combatants for Peace. Thousands participated in the ceremony, including several hundred Palestinians from the West Bank who were allowed to enter Israel only by a High Court ruling; the event was also protested by several hundred right-wing activists, who shouted threats and disparagements at the participants. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\" !Year !Title !Role !Comments |- |2019 |Zot Vezoti |Darel |Television series, 1 episode |- |2018 |Out |Rauda |Short film |- |2018 |She Has It |Hudna |Television series |- |2018 |Fauda | |Television series, episode 2.6 |- |2018 |The Valley of the Cross | |Experimental film |- |2017 |Death of a Poetess |\u05d9\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05df |Feature film |- |2017 |Longing |Rauda |Feature film |- |2016 |Nation Monsters and Super Queers |Herself |Documentary film |- |2014 |Self Made |Nadine Nasrallah |Feature film |- |2012\u20132014 |Minimum Wage |Amal |Television series |- |2009 |City of Borders |Herself |Documentary film |- |2009 |Gevald |Samira |Short film |} == Theater == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\" !Year !Title !Role !Comments |- |2016 |Schreber |The Nurse |Best Play award, Acre Festival Golden Hedgehog (Best Supporting Actress) |- |2014 |Salim, Salim | |Best Play award, Acre Festival |- |2013 |Hutzbama | |Most Daring Play, Best Set, Acre Festival |- |2012 |The Silwan Peacock |Amal |Special Commendation for Acting, Acre FestivalGolden Hedgehog (Best Supporting Actress) |} == Awards == * 2017 \u2013 Golden Hedgehog Best Supporting Actress Award, Schreber * 2017 \u2013 Best Actress Award, Jerusalem Film Festival, Death of a Poetess * 2015 \u2013 Golden Hedgehog Best Supporting Actress Award, Silwan Peacock * 2015 \u2013 Nominations for two media awards at TLVFest for promoting LGBT visibility * 2012 \u2013 Special commendation for unique acting, Acre festival, Silwan Peacock * 2019 \u2013 Best Student Film award at the Haifa International Film Festival; longlist for Israeli Academy of Film award for Best Short Film, Out. == References == == External links == * * Samira \u2013 Coming Out blog * Interview with Mira Awad, Mira.net, Channel 33 (Israel), April 5, 2013 * Nation Monsters and Super Queers Category:Palestinian rappers Category:Lesbian actresses Category:Palestinian actresses Category:Israeli Arab feminists Category:Arab citizens of Israel Category:Palestinian feminists Category:Palestinian film actresses Category:Palestinian women poets Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Palestinian poets ",
