His fleet suffered typhoon in Zhejiang, most of the ships were wrecked near Huangyan County (present-day Huangyan District, Taizhou, Zhejiang). The survivors had to get ashore, but ambushed by Qing army. Lun was captured, he pretended to be mute, but Chinese government found his official seal in his vessel.
