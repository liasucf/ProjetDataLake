Canadian-born entrepreneur David Lyons and PBS Distribution formed a joint venture to run the channel. ===Independent films=== After a backlash from filmmakers over WNET's attempts to move independent documentary series to its secondary station, PBS took feedback from the documentary community and developed an indie film strategy. Through Independent Lens, PBS acquired Stanley Nelson\u2019s documentary film The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution. The history of The Black Panthers was especially timely due to the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement's growth. The film was first released in theaters in late 2015, then had a special nationwide public television premiere in late 2016. PBSd expanded its operation to included theatrical distribution of documentary films by hiring Erin Owens as PBS Distribution's Head of Theatrical Distribution; and Emily Rothschild as Director of Theatrical Acquisitions and Marketing. Owens and Rothschild had just worked with PBS on Stanley Nelson's The Black Panthers distribution. The operations expansion of PBSd was announced at the Sundance Film Festival on 19 January 2017. The company plans to get theatrical and non-theatrical rights for up to six feature-length documentaries to release per year. PBSd put British show, Jamestown as a streaming first run on PBS Passport and PBS Masterpiece as of March 23, 2018. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * Official PBS Distribution \u2212 PBSd website * Bill Reed papers, at the University of Maryland libraries.
