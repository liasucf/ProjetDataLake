    "text": "The Red and the Blue (Il Rosso e il Blu) was an Italian stop motion animated television series for children. It has two clay animated characters, antagonistic shapeshifters, one colored red, the other blue. It is by Misseri Studios.Nostalgia Central: \"The Red and the Blue\" The show sets the two characters in an undifferentiated white plane in which they interact. They are able to assume various forms at will, for example in one episode The Blue becomes a boat while The Red becomes an island, later the Blue becomes a suitcase while The Red partially converts his body into a chest-of-drawers, filling the suitcase with red 'clothes'. Misseri's website describes the situation as: > Two blocks of clay. The Red is big and passionate; he like driving fast > cars, eating... enjoying all the pleasures of life. The blue is small, smart > and cunning, and he's there just to bother the red. The characters communicate in a prelingual form that conveys emotions without using any particular language. This avoided the need for translation or subtitles. Francesco Misseri describes the language \"non-verbal\" and \"onomatopoeic\" on the website and in a comment on YouTube. The series was written and directed by Francesco Misseri with music by Piero Barbetti. In Australia it was first broadcast on the ABC. In the United States, it first aired in 1976 on Captain Kangaroo. ==References== ==External links== * Misseri Studio's YouTube Channel Category:1976 Italian television series debuts Category:1970s animated television series Category:1970s children's television series Category:Clay animation television series Category:Italian children's animated television series Category:Stop-motion animated television series Category:Television series about shapeshifting ",
