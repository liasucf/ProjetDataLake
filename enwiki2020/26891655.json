Scotland, and that in his last year, 1884, when he was said to have been playing in finer form than on any previous occasion. Known for his attacking, rather than defensive play he was described as a brilliant halfback, \"a fine runner with a very difficult dodge, but was a trifle uncertain, and had no powers of dropping.\"Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p162, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) He played his final match for England on 1 March 1884 at Rectory Field, Blackheath in the England vs Scotland match. ==References== Category:1853 births Category:1899 deaths Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:Rugby union halfbacks Category:Richmond F.C. players ",
