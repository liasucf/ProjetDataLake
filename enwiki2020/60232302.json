    "text": "Destroyer is the fifth studio album by Canadian psychedelic rock band, Black Mountain. The album was released on May 24, 2019, through Dine Alone Records, and is the band's first new material in three years since their fourth album, IV. Destroyer is the first album to feature Rachel Fannan (from Sleepy Sun) and Adam Bulgasem (from Dommengang and Soft Kill). == Background == The album was first announced on March 7, 2019 with the release of their lead off single, \"Future Shade\". The single was described by lead singer, Stephen McBean, as a \"warping\" and \"rending\". McBean described the riff as one that has \"traveled around the world then hit the bong with a chorus a year and a half later. A last attempt at double frosting produced a chorus on chorus death match. Anxiety is the new heavy metal.\" The album takes its name from discontinued single-run 1985 Dodge Destroyer. The album also references the fact that McBean obtained his driver's license in 2017. Destroyer features contributions from the Flaming Lips' Kliph Scurlock and Oneida's Kid Millions. == Style and composition == Destroyer has been described as having a mixture of stoner rock, progressive rock, hard rock, neo-psychedelia, and space rock. == Promotion == === Singles === Three singles were released prior to the release of Destroyer. The lead single, \"Future Shade\" was released on March 7, 2019. The second single, \"Boogie Lover\" came out on April 11, 2019. The third single, \"Licensed to Drive\" came out on May 8, 2019. David Nadelle of Tiny Mix Tapes described \"Boogie Lover\" as a \"bevy of heavy friends both old and new\", referring to the appearances by Jeremy Schmidt, Kliph Scurlock (Flaming Lips), Kid Millions (Oneida), Rachel Fannan (Sleepy Sun), and Adam Bulgasem (Dommengang). Chris DeVille of Stereogum called the song \"a spacey, doomy slow creep on which the band sounds as towering and geological as their band name suggests.\" Also writing for Stereogum, Tom Breihan praised \"Licensed to Drive\", saying the track \"starts out with eerie horror-movie theatrics, locks into \u201970s-style dragon-trudge metal, and climaxes with a wild Edgar Winter-ish synth solo. It\u2019s flaming-sword music, music for blasting off into the cosmos on a tricked-out GTO.\" == Critical reception == Destroyer was well-received by contemporary music critics. At review aggregator website, Metacritic, the album holds an average rating of 74 out of 100 based on ten critic reviews indicating generally favorable reviews. == Track listing == ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} == References == Category:2019 albums Category:Albums produced by John Congleton Category:Black Mountain (band) albums Category:Dine Alone Records albums ",
