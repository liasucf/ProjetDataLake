    "text": "Hederagenin is a triterpenoid which is a chemical constituent of the Hedera helix plant. Hederagenin is the aglycone part of numerous saponins found in Hedera helix (common ivy), the most prevalent of these being hederacoside C and alpha-hederin. It is also one of three primary triterpenoids extracted from the Chenopodium quinoa plant categorized by the EPA as a biopesticide.BIOPESTICIDES REGISTRATION ACTION DOCUMENT, Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa. HeadsUp Plant Protectant is made up of approximately equal ratios of the saponin aglycones oleanolic acid, hederagenin, and phytolaccagenic acid and is intended for use as a seed treatment on tuber (e.g. potato seed pieces), legume, and cereal seeds or as a pre-plant root dip for roots of transplants, at planting, to prevent fungal growth, bacterial growth, and viral plant diseases. Hederagenin has been found to have antidepressant-like effects in a rodent models. ==History== Hederagenin was discovered by L. Posselt in 1849 and named hederic acid.L. Posselt, \"On the constituents of the seeds of ivy\", Liebig's Annalen der Chemie, January 1849. However, Posselt was not able to isolate a pure substance or obtain an exact formula: his hederic acid was hederagenin mixed with some tannin impurity.John Lionel Simonsen, The Terpenes, p. 174, Cambridge University Press, 1947 . ==Related triterpenes== All of these compounds share the same pentacyclic framework: * Betulinic acid * Boswellic acid * Glycyrrhetinic acid * Moronic acid * Oleanolic acid * Ursolic acid * Corosolic acid * Amyrin * Lupeol * Maslinic acid * Hopane ==References== Category:Biopesticides Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Triterpenes Category:Diols ",
