He plays for FC Veles Moscow. ==Club career== He made his debut in the Russian Professional Football League for FC Solyaris Moscow on 20 July 2016 in a game against FSK Dolgoprudny. In July 2018 his failed transfer back to Torpedo Moscow caused a stir when it was reported the club canceled his contract because the ultras refused to allow a black footballer to play for the club. Torpedo later denied this via an official statement but the Torpedo ultras were adamant with their own statement. He made his Russian Football National League debut for Luch Vladivostok on 24 July 2019 in a game against FC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 births Category:People from Pushkino Category:Russian people of Republic of the Congo descent Category:Living people Category:Russian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:FC Solyaris Moscow players Category:FC Lokomotiv Moscow players Category:FC Luch Vladivostok players Category:Russian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Georgia (country) ",
