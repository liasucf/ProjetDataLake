In Liga Leumit Lior scored a league leading twenty-eight goals, so after the 2001\u201302 season, club chairman Ariel Shaiman loaned Lior out to clubs in the top league and signed him to a long term contract with Herzliya hoping to cash in on a large transfer fee. During his seasons on loan, Lior has won the State Cup and established himself as one of the top Israeli strikers in the domestic league. Subsequently, after the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Herzliya chairman Ariel Shaiman disclosed to the media that he received lucrative offers from Olympique de Marseille and OGC Nice from France, from Russia, Turkey, 3 teams from Cyprus, and from a team in Greece for Asulin's services though nothing has ever come about from said offers. === Beitar Jerusalem === After winning the State Cup with Bnei Sakhnin, Asulin was signed on loan by Beitar Jerusalem. In June 2007, he signed for a four-year contract with Hapoel Tel Aviv. In January 2008 after a not so good time in Hapoel with a record of 0 league goal he signed for Apollon Limassol. From 2009 to 2011 Lior played for Hapoel Be'er Sheva in the Israeli Premier League. === Return to Liga Leumit === On 17 August 2011 he signed a contract with Hapoel Ramat Gan in Liga Leumit. Asulin helped them win the Leumit double as they won the Toto Cup and the league to secure promotion to the Premier League.
