In 1885, nine-year- old Meister was badly bitten by a rabid dog. After consulting with Alfred Vulpian and Jacques-Joseph Grancher and obtaining their assistance, Louis Pasteur agreed to inoculate the boy with spinal tissue from rabid rabbits, which he had successfully used to prevent rabies in dogs. The treatment was successful and the boy did not develop rabies.Ren\u00e9 Dubos, Louis Pasteur: Freelance Of Science, Little, Brown and Company, 1950. As an adult, Meister served as a caretaker at the Pasteur Institute until his death in 1940 at age 64. On 24 June 1940, ten days after the German army occupied Paris during World War II, Meister committed suicide with his gas gun.Eug\u00e8ne Wollman, Archives de l'Institut Pasteur, Fond Eug\u00e8ne Wollman, cote WLL1.A.1, \"Journal d\u2019Eugene Wollman\u201d, 1940.Hubert Marneffe, Archives de l'Institut Pasteur, Fond Hubert Marneffe, cote MRF.ARC.13, note d'Hubert Marneffe : \"Mort de Joseph Meister\".

In a tragic irony, they actually came back the same day he took his life.Eug\u00e8ne Wollman, Archives de l'Institut Pasteur, Fond Eug\u00e8ne Wollman, cote WLL1.A.1, \"Journal d\u2019Eugene Wollman\u201d, 1940.Veterinary Medicine 35, p. 5538, 1940 ==Portrayals== Meister was played by Dickie Moore in the 1936 film The Story of Louis Pasteur.
