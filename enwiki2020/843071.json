    "text": "The Indian numbering system is used in the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) to express large numbers. The terms lakh (100,000) and crore (10,000,000) are the most commonly used terms (even in English, such as in a local variety called Indian English) to express large numbers in the system. ==System== There are words for numbers larger than 1 crore as well, but these are not commonly used and are unfamiliar to most speakers. These include 1 arab (equal to 100 crore or 1 billion), 1 kharab (equal to 100 arab or 100 billion), 1 nil (sometimes incorrectly transliterated as neel; equal to 100 kharab or 10 trillion), 1 padma (equal to 100 nil or 1 quadrillion), 1 shankh (equal to 100 padma or 100 quadrillion), and 1 mahashankh (equal to 100 shankh or 10 quintillion). In common parlance, the thousand, lakh, and crore terminology (though inconsistent) repeats for larger numbers: thus 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) becomes 1 lakh crore, written as 10,00,00,00,00,000. The Indian numbering system corresponds to the Western system for the zeroth through fourth powers of ten: one (100), ten (101), one hundred (102), one thousand (103), ten thousand (104). For higher powers of ten, the names no longer correspond. In the Indian system, the next powers of ten are called one lakh, ten lakh, one crore, ten crore, one arab (or one hundred crore), and so on; there are new words for every second power of ten (105 + 2n): lakh (105), crore (107), arab (109), etc. In the Western system, the next powers of ten are called one hundred thousand, one million, ten million, one hundred million, one billion, and so on; there are new words for every third power of ten (103n): million (106), billion (109), trillion (1012), etc. The written numbers differ only in the placement of commas, which group the digits into powers of one hundred in the Indian system (except for the first thousand), and into powers of one thousand in the Western system. The Indian and most English systems both use the decimal point and the comma digit-separator, while some other languages and countries using the Western numbering system use the decimal comma and the thin space or point to group digits. ===Examples=== 150,000 rupees in India is referred to as \"1.5 lakh rupees\", which is written as 1,50,000 rupees; 30,000,000 (thirty million) rupees is referred to as \"3 crore rupees\", which is written as 3,00,00,000 rupees with commas at the thousand, lakh, and crore places. ==Use of separators== The Indian numbering system uses separators differently from the international norm. Instead of grouping digits by threes as in the international system, the Indian numbering system groups the rightmost three digits together (until the hundreds place), and thereafter groups by sets of two digits. One trillion would thus be written as 10,00,00,00,00,000 or 10 kharab (or one lakh crore). This makes the number convenient to read using the system's terminology. Thus: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:both;margin:1em auto;text-align:left\" |- !align=\"right\"|Indian system !align=\"right\"|International system !In words (Indian) !In words (International) |- |align=\"right\"| 5,00,000 |align=\"right\"| 500,000 |Five lakh(s) |Five hundred thousand |- |align=\"right\"| 12,12,12,123 |align=\"right\"| 121,212,123 |Twelve crore twelve lakh twelve thousand one hundred and twenty- three |One hundred and twenty-one million two hundred and twelve thousand one hundred and twenty-three |- |align=\"right\"| 17,00,00,00,000 |align=\"right\"| 17,000,000,000 |Seventeen arab |Seventeen billion |- |6,78,90,00,00,00,00,000 |6,789,000,000,000,000 |Six padma seventy-eight nil ninety kharab |Six quadrillion seven hundred and eighty nine trillion |} This accords with the Indian numbering system, which has units for thousands, hundreds of thousands, tens of millions, etc. ==Names of numbers== The table below follows the short scale usage of one billion being one thousand million. In India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, following former British usage, the long scale was used, with one billion equivalent to one million million. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:both;margin:1em auto;text-align:left\" |+ Names of numbers |- !

The article states: \"The opinions and other information contained in the OED blog posts and comments do not necessarily reflect the opinions or positions of Oxford University Press.\" == Current usage == The usage of this system is limited to the nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Most institutions and citizens in India use Indian number system, though the Reserve Bank of India has been noted as an exception. T. N. Ninan, in an article published by ThePrint and elsewhere, examined reasons why India should consider switching away from using the terminology of lakhs and crores. This would include harmonization with the international numeral system. Issues can occur with computer software with some applications configured to insert a thousands separator after every 3 digits. Ninan notes the rare usage of identities other than lakh and crore are rarely used, leading to \"mental gymnastics\", and with a Government post of spending \"20 lakh crore\" (2 nil) being claimed to have gone viral on social media discussing the number of zeros involved. ==References== Category:Numerals Numbering system Numbering system Numbering system Numbering system Category:Numeral systems Category:Economy of Bangladesh Category:Economy of Sri Lanka ",
