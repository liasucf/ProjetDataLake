    "text": "A alt=A pictogram used to denote a vaping ban. The following is a list of vaping bans in the United States. For federal regulation concerning the legal status of the sale of electronic cigarettes products in and outside the United States, see the worldwide regulation of electronic cigarettes. ==General regulation== ===Federal=== alt=A no smoking or vaping sign from the US. Effective August 8, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates electronic cigarettes products to be regulated as tobacco products. The FDA rule also bans sales to minors. The FDA classified e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) before importation and sale in the US. Following an outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products that sickened hundreds of people and left six people dead in the US, the Donald Trump administration in September 2019 was working on plans to ban e-cigarette liquid flavors. ===State=== Some state and regional governments have extended existing indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. , 12 US states and 615 localities had prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in venues in which traditional cigarette smoking was prohibited. High schools and some middle schools throughout the US have been revising their tobacco rules to ban vaping on school grounds. 13 states, 2 territories, and 841 municipalities have outlawed vaping in smoke-free public areas, as of April 2019. A review of regulations in 40 US states found that how a law defines tobacco products may allow e-cigarettes to avoid smoke-free laws, taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing. The tobacco industry heavily lobbies states to make it harder to regulate and tax e-cigarettes. ==Indoor bans== thumb|400px|Indoor vaping laws by-state in the US. alt=The sign states: No smoking and vaping within 9 meters of building. In August 2016, a World Health Organization (WHO) report recommended that e-cigarettes be banned in indoor areas or where smoking is prohibited. This is because of their potential for non-users to be exposed to chemicals and e-cigarette aerosol in indoor areas. Many local and state jurisdictions have recently begun enacting laws that prohibit e-cigarette usage everywhere that smoking is banned, although some state laws with comprehensive smoke-free laws will still allow for vaping to be permitted in bars and restaurants while prohibiting e-cigarettes in other indoor places. The only states that do not regulate indoor vaping at all, be it by state territory or on a local level, are in the states of Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Tennessee. ===Alabama=== *Localities with vaping bans that include all bars and restaurants (11 total): **Anniston, July 1, 2013, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Clay, January 6, 2012, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Creola, April 25, 2013, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Fultondale, September 1, 2011, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants; also includes private clubs **Gadsden, January 1, 2015, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Homewood, November 19, 2015, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Midfield, December 28, 2011, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Monroeville, March 19, 2013, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Mountain Brook, October 19, 2016, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Troy, June 25, 2013, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Vestavia Hills, August 26, 2013, banned in workplaces, bars, restaurants, hotels/motels, and within of entrances and exits *Localities with vaping bans that do not include all bars and restaurants (3 total): **Bessemer, November 1, 2012, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including restaurants but exempting bars **Foley, June 18, 2014, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including restaurants but exempting bars **Opelika, October 7, 2014, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including restaurants but exempting bars *Localities with vaping bans that do not include bars and restaurants (2 total): **Daphne, August 18, 2014 banned in enclosed facilities owned, operated or leased by the city, including vehicles; vaping can also be prohibited where there is an owner, operator, manager, or other person having control of a place meeting certain criteria **Madison, November 24, 2014, banned in all city buildings ===Alaska=== *Localities with vaping bans that include bars and restaurants (3 total): **Dillingham, banned in bars and restaurants, but not other workplaces **Juneau, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants **Palmer, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants ===Arizona=== *Localities in Arizona with vaping bans that include bars and restaurants (1 total): **Tempe, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants *Localities in Arizona with vaping bans that do not include all bars and restaurants (1 total): **Coconino County, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including restaurants but exempting bars ===Arkansas=== *No statewide vaping ban.

In June 2019, San Francisco banned the sale of e-cigarettes in the city from early 2020. The ban was made effective by a citywide ordinance signed by Mayor London Breed in July 2019.
