He was briefly a national affairs columnist for the Toronto Star in 2016-17. Before that, he was a columnist for Maclean's for 13 years; his column originally appeared in the back page slot famously occupied for many years by Allan Fotheringham, but was subsequently moved to the front of the magazine with other columns. == Background == Wells was born in Sarnia, Ontario, the son of Seigrid Eleanor (Wedin) and Allen Rollins Wells.macleans.ca \"Lessons from my Dad\" , 15 Jun 2012 His mother's family was Swedish.http://swedesinminnesota.com/getperson.php?personID=I14708&tree;=minnesota He attended Northern Collegiate Institute and Vocational School where he played trumpet in the school's jazz band and captained a winning Reach for the Top team. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1989 with a BA in political science. While at UWO, Wells spent a lot of his time working on The Gazette, the undergraduate student newspaper, where he was news editor. After graduation, he landed an internship at the Montreal Gazette. Midway through his tenure there, Wells took a year off and moved to France to study politics and improve his French, hoping that this would help him move to the political beat. In 1994 the Gazette assigned Wells to Ottawa as a political columnist. His work for the Gazette and his occasional pieces in Saturday Night magazine during this period brought him to the attention of editors and political writers, and in 1998 Wells moved to the new National Post daily newspaper as a political columnist. Wells became frustrated at the Post after its sale to the Asper family and the severe downsizing that followed, and in 2003 he moved to Maclean's. Wells supplements his weekly column with his blog, Inkless Wells hosted on the Maclean's website. Wells' first book, Right Side Up: The Fall of Paul Martin and the Rise of Stephen Harper's New Conservatism, debuted in October 2006 and quickly appeared on multiple Canadian best seller lists.McClelland.com | Books | Right Side Up by Paul Wells In early 2012, he released his e-book The Harper Decade, following Stephen Harper's rise to power.

His angle is that these Quebec journalists downplay any Canadian history before the Quiet Revolution of Jean Lesage, because it is inconvenient for the separatists.macleans.ca: \"Terre de nos a\u00efeux\", 8 May 2008 == Honours== In his 13 years at Maclean's, he won three gold National Magazine Awards.
