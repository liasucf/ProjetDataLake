She appeared as Tamiri in Mozart's Il re pastore at the Nederlandse Opera Amsterdam, as Virtu in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea at the Salzburg Festival, as Fenena in Verdi's Nabucco at the Bregenz Festival and as Flora in Verdi's La traviata at the Zurich Festival.

In 2011 she appeared as Ortrud in Lohengrin, staged by Hans Neuenfels. In 2016, she took over the role of Isolde in the production by Katharina Wagner conducted by Christian Thielemann. A reviewer noted her \"floating dark cantilenas\" (\"mit schwebenden, dunklen Kantilenen\").

She sang the solo in Mahler's Third Symphony at the Royal Festival Hall on 12 December 2007 with the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra, conducted by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky. A review noted her \"haunting, intense, totally engrossing 'O Mensch, gib Acht!'\", with \"immaculate phrasing\". She performed the work again in Freiburg with the SWR Orchestra in 2016. == References == == External links == * * Petra Lang wagneropera.net * Petra Lang Vienna State Opera * Petra Lang operabase.com * A Singer's Life: Petra Lang talks to Jim Pritchard musicweb- international.com * Richard Wagner (1813\u20131883) / Die Walk\u00fcre musicweb- international.com Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:German operatic sopranos Category:German operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:Musicians from Frankfurt ",
