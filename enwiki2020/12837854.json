    "text": "Sarah Jones (born 1959) in London, United Kingdom, is a visual artist working primarily in the realm of photography. Her practice is deeply rooted in art history, and she draws influence from topics such as Psychoanalysis, adolescence, and the Victorian period. She gained international recognition in the mid 1990s coinciding with the completion of her MA in Fine Art at Goldsmith's College in London in 1996. == Career and early life == Jones' career gained recognition after her completion of her MA at Goldsmith's College in 1996. She went on to be involved in many notable exhibitions, including the 3rd International Tokyo Photo Bienalle, presented at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography and Another Girl, Another Planet curated by Gregory Crewdson and involving 12 other contemporary and notable photographers. === Another Girl, Another Planet === Jones was also involved in the 1999 show Another Girl, Another Planet along with 9 other female artists, curated by Gregory Crewdson and Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn at the Van Doren Gallery in New York, NYC. Other artists involved in the show included Anna Gaskell, Katy Grannan, Malerie Marder, Justine Kurland and more. The show consisted primarily of topics surrounding adolescence and womanhood. The show had mixed reviews, many critics, such as Katy Seigel, criticized the pornographic and sexualized elements in the show, referring in particular to photos of adolescent girls. Seigel went on to publish an article about the photographers involved in the show titling it \"Dial P for Panties: Narrative Photography in the 1990s \" and delivered some harsh reviews labelling the group of female artists the 'Panty Photographers'. Another review from the New York Times, published in 1999, describes the show as dreamy and erotically charged, \"Justine Kurland's wide-screen color pictures of gangs of unsupervised girls at play in the woods, Katy Grannan's portraits of teen- agers posed in their underwear in their bedrooms, Sarah Jones's big Pre- Raphaelite-esque image of pensive twins in a backyard garden or Malerie Marder's vision of a girl in a bikini floating on a pool raft, you feel the mood of dreamy, erotically charged vagrancy by which the photographers themselves seem to be so fruitfully possessed.\" === Present day === Jones is Reader and Senior Tutor in Photography at the Royal College of Art in London. Jones's work has been included in numerous exhibitions, nationally and internationally. Solo exhibitions include: Museum Folkwang, Essen; Museum Reina Sofia, Madrid; Le Consortium, Dijon; Huis Marseille, Amsterdam; Maureen Paley, London and Anton Kern Gallery, New York. Group exhibitions include; Tate Britain; Tate Liverpool; Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg; Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden; Orange County Museum, Los Angeles, and Norton Museum of Art, Florida. Her work is represented in both public and private collections nationally and internationally. == Influences == Jones enjoys the medium of photography for its capability to scrutinize something, freezing a moment to look more closely at it.Homes, A.M. \"Still Life: Interview with Sarah Jones\" , Issue 116. 2008. \"Perhaps photography allows us to daydream; reverie is where time seems to stretch out.\" Jones states in an interview with A.M. Homes for Frieze magazine. She is also heavily influenced by psychoanalysis and the theories of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and other well known psychological theorists. These ideas of psychoanalysis were explored in her series of photos of psychoanalysts couches She wanted to explore the spaces that allowed for people to re-live experiences and loosen the grip that their past has on them. Through talking with the head of the British Institute of Psychoanalysis, she learned that patients often acted as if there were a third party in the session, this was interesting to her in the sense of the camera being the third presence. Creating the idea of an audience. Jones' images are narrative in nature, and she is interested in how a narrative is constructed. She also believes that photography leaves a space for the viewer to bring a unique narrative and experience to an image. She develops her narratives using various visual codes that allude to her many different references that she makes throughout her body of work. Some of these codes include her use of reference to art history, and her fetishization of hair. Her photograph \"Horse(profile)(black)(I)\" from 2010 has been referenced to Muybridge's black horse, and her photographs of roses are said to be compared to Karl Blossfeldt's botanical studies. Her art historical references are apparent in her choice of colors within her photos. She has a strong presence of blue, to indicate the Sublime, or distance in Renaissance painting. As well as strong notes of red in her photos such as in \"Living Room (Curtain)(I)]\".http://www.sleek-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sarah- Jones-The-Living-Room-Curtain-i-2003.-150-x-150-cm.jpg Her Flower series is heavily influenced by the gothic era, pulling inspiration from the aesthetics of that time to create 'Victorian rose gardens' and rich mysterious colors and darkness. She is also heavily influenced by the Victorian cultural obsession with photographing hair, and how hair can act as an allegory to location and figure, or in her words hair can represent \"nature gone slightly mad\". Hair reminds her of the roses she photographs, \"visceral, spindly and beautiful, in bloom but slightly diseased\". == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Exhibitions |- |2014 |Maureen Paley, London, UK.
