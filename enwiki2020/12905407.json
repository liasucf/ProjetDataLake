    "text": "Polish soldiers in Vilnius (Wilno) in 1920 \u017beligowski's Mutiny ( also \u017celigiada, ) was a Polish false flag operation led by General Lucjan \u017beligowski in October 1920, which resulted in the creation of the Republic of Central Lithuania. Polish Chief of State J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski surreptitiously ordered \u017beligowski to carry out the operation, and revealed the truth several years later. The area was formally annexed by Poland in 1922 and internationally recognized as Polish territory in 1923. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim the Vilnius region. ==Background== General Lucjan \u017beligowski In late 1920, the Polish-Soviet War was ending with the Soviets defeated at the Battle of Warsaw and in full retreat. The disputed Vilnius region centered on the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius (Polish Wilno), which had been founded by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in 1323 and had been the Lithuanian capital ever since. Vilnius had been occupied by the Soviets during their summer 1920 offensive. The Soviets returned the region to the Lithuanians because the latter had allowed Soviet troops to move through Lithuanian territory and engaged Polish forces in the disputed territories (see Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, and Polish-Lithuanian War). This move allowed the Soviets to retain tactical control of the region, deny it to the Poles, and increase the already high tensions between the Poles and Lithuanians, both of whom claimed the disputed territory as their own.

In early October 1920, under international pressure from the Spa and Suwa\u0142ki Conferences, Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 166\u201375. the Poles and Lithuanians signed a ceasefire in the Sudova region, but, with the issue of Vilnius remaining under Lithuanian control, the issue was unresolved. The Poles rested their claim on then current ethnographic considerations, as approximately 65% of the inhabitants of the city at the time were Polish-speakers, while Lithuanians constituted approximately 1-2% of the city's population.Piotr Eberhardt. Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-Century Central- Eastern Europe: History, Data, Analysis. M.E. Sharpe. 2003. p. 39. Lithuania pointed to Vilnius as its historical capital and denied Polish claims to it as baseless.Michael MacQueen, The Context of Mass Destruction: Agents and Prerequisites of the Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Volume 12, Number 1, pp. 27-48, 1998, The Poles did not wish to continue the war as the Polish army was tired, and Polish Chief of State J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski was still hoping to create a Mi\u0119dzymorze federation, to include a Lithuania friendly to Poland, but wanted to ensure that Vilnius would be part of a Polish sphere of influence. From the Lithuanian point of view, that was highly unlikely, as many Lithuanians saw Polish influence as pernicious and had wanted to be rid of Polish influence from as far back as the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the then 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland in 1386. In particular, Lithuanian nationalists opposed any further connection to Poland, especially after the Polish occupation of Vilnius. The negotiations on the future of the disputed area, held under the auspice of a Conference of Ambassadors in Brussels and Paris, reached a stalemate, and Pi\u0142sudski feared that the Entente might accept the fait accompli that had been created by the Soviets' transfer of territorial control to Lithuania. Poland and Lithuania were to adhere to a mutually agreed upon ceasefire in Suwa\u0142ki Region on October 10, but the Poles decided to circumvent the ceasefire by creating a \"fait accompli\" of their own. Pi\u0142sudski concluded that the best course of action would be one that supported the pro-Polish faction in Lithuania, but that could not be traced directly to Poland. However, his plans for a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1919 had been foiled by the premature and unplanned Sejny Uprising, which had led to the destruction of the Polish Military Organization (P.O.W.) intelligence network in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Army and State Security Department. Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, p. 68. ==Mutiny== Polish ethnographic map from 1912, according to pre-war censuses Map of the Polish population living in Central Lithuania c. 1920 In October 1920, Polish General Lucjan \u017beligowski, a native of the historic lands of Lithuania, was given command of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division (comprising mostly individuals from the Kresy). Grzegorz \u0141ukowski and Rafal E. Stolarski, Walka o Wilno. Z dziej\u00f3w Samoobrony Litwy i Bialorusi, 1918-1919 (The Struggle for Vilnius: the History of the Self-Defense of Lithuania and Belarus, 1918\u20131919), Adiutor, 1994, . \u017beligowski had been contacted by Pi\u0142sudski as early as late September 1920 with suggestions to carry out a \"mutiny.\" They prepared a plan by which \u017beligowski and forces under his command were to pretend to desert from the Polish Army and then take control of the city of Vilnius and the Vilnius region. The Polish government would officially deny its involvement, thereby preserving its reputation on the international scene.Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 161\u20136. \u017beligowski, like Pi\u0142sudski himself\u2014may have been one of many who were torn between Lithuanian and Polish identities; possibly, in proclaiming a Central Lithuania, he honestly believed that he was creating a Lithuania even if it that was dominated by Polish culture rather than Lithuanian culture.Endre Bojt\u00e1r, Foreword to the Past: A Cultural History of the Baltic People, Central European University Press, 1999, , Print, p. 202. On October 6, 1920, \u017beligowski informed his officers of the plans for mutiny; at that point, no one under his command knew that he was acting with Pi\u0142sudski's backing, and some refused to follow him. Support for \u017beligowski wavered to such an extent that on October 7, he messaged Pi\u0142sudski that he could not carry out the operation due to lack of support among his troops. Eventually, however, most of the officers and men decided to follow him, and he proceeded with the operation. Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 175\u201379. Polish caricature: a Lithuanian trying to stop General \u017beligowski from taking Wilno (Vilnius) \u017beligowski's forces set out on the morning of October 8 (two days before the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement ceasefire was to take hold). That day, he declared that he would \"liberate Wilno from Lithuanian occupation\" and \"form a parliament which will decide the fate of the disputed territories.\" \u017beligowski's forces\u2014numbering some 14,000, centered on his 1st Lithuanian- Belarusian Infantry Division\u2014defeated the Lithuanian 4th Infantry Regiment near the R\u016bdininkai Forest, and again in a skirmish near Ja\u0161i\u016bnai. Polish forces reached the vicinity of Vilnius, but were slowed enough to delay their taking the city until the next day. The death toll, as reported by contemporary sources, was low: \"a few casualties\" on both sides. \"Wypadki wile\u0144skie\" (\"Wilno Events\"), Robotnik (The Worker), October 20, 1920, p. 3. The Lithuanian forces in the region were heavily outnumbered: they not only faced \u017beligowski's numerically superior regular forces, supported by Polish Army logistics, but also had to garrison Vilnius, whose Polish population was restless. On October 9, the Lithuanian forces were unable to defend Vilnius and evacuated the city, with only token attempts at defending it (the decision to evacuate was made in the afternoon of October 8, and the evacuation took place during the night of October 8\u20139). When Polish units assaulted the remaining Lithuanian defenses around Vilnius, the city's Polish population supported the Polish troops, with militia units staging an uprising and engaging Lithuanian units still in the city, and civilians welcoming the Polish troops as they entered Vilnius. Lithuanian government representatives (led by Ignas Jonynas) passed control of the city to resident Entente officials (led by French colonel Constantin Reboul). \u017beligowski, however, refused to recognize their authority, and they were forced to leave the city.Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 179\u2013185 Gen. \u017beligowski leading his soldiers, Wilno (Vilnius), 1920 On October 12, \u017beligowski proclaimed the independence of the area as the Republic of Central Lithuania, with Vilnius as its capital. Most historians agree that the state was dependent on Poland, but they disagree to what extent (Polish historian Jerzy J. Lerski calls it a puppet state).Jerzy J. Lerski, Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966\u20131945, 1996, Google Print, p. 309. Meanwhile, a uniformed Polish armed force of 20 airplanes and the 13th Cavalry Regiment under the command of Col. Butkiewicz joined the mutiny. The Polish Army, however, was officially bound by the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement ceasefire and did not engage the Lithuanian units by the line. On October 20\u201321 there were further battles between Central and Lithuanian forces near the village of Pikeli\u0161kiai. On November 7, \u017beligowski's army began to advance upon Giedrai\u010diai, \u0160irvintos and K\u0117dainiai. \u017beligowski's proposals of a cease-fire were ignored by Lithuania. \u017beligowski ignored League of Nations's Military Control Commission proposals to withdraw to October 20\u201321 lines and begin negotiations. On November 17, Soviet Russia offered military aid, which the Lithuanians declined. Polish cavalry broke Lithuanian defense lines and on November 18 reached Kavarskas and continued toward Kaunas. However, on November 19\u201321, the Lithuanian main forces pushed \u017beligowski's main forces back near Giedrai\u010diai and \u0160irvintos. In Polish literature, it is considered a local skirmish of minor importance.Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, p. 217. Both sides were now exhausted. With the help of the League of Nations, on November 20 a ceasefire was negotiated, to take effect on November 21, 1920, at 9 o'clock in the morning; until then, both sides agreed to take no offensive actions. The Lithuanian 7th Infantry Regiment counterattacked at Giedrai\u010diai on the night of November 20\u201321, just before the ceasefire was to go into effect, persisting even after the ceasefire (until 14:00); this offensive gained Giedrai\u010diai for the Lithuanians. The Lithuanian forces stopped after a strong-wordedrequest from the League of Nations, and a truce was finally signed on November 29.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 9, pp. 64-67Piotr \u0141ossowski, Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920, pp. 216\u20138. It was at this time that the close ally of Pi\u0142sudski, Micha\u0142 Pius R\u00f6mer, a leader of the Krajowcy movement, broke with Pilsudski and made the decision to side with the re-established Lithuanian Republic, even though Pi\u0142sudski offered to appoint him Prime Minister of the Republic of Central Lithuania. ==Aftermath== The Republic of Central Lithuania (shown in green) \u017beligowski became the new state's de facto military dictator, but after elections he relinquished his powers to the newly elected parliament. c. 1925 Lithuanian poster, which urges to recapture the Vilnius Region In 1922 Central Lithuania's parliament voted for their state's incorporation into Poland.A. Srebrakowski, Sejm Wile\u0144ski 1922 roku. Idea i jej realizacja, Wroc\u0142aw 1993 In 1923, soon after the League of Nations had recognized the existing situation and accepted the Polish-Lithuanian border on March 15, Pi\u0142sudski on August 24, 1923 would publicly admit that \u017beligowski's Mutiny had in fact been a pre- planned operation carried out with his knowledge and support.George Slocombe, A Mirror to Geneva: Its Growth, Grandeur, and Decay, 1970. Google Print, p. 263 Despite Poland's claim to Vilnius, the League of Nations asked Poland to withdraw. Poland declined. In principle, British and French troops could have been asked to enforce the League\u2019s decision. France, however, did not wish to antagonize Poland, a possible ally in a future war against Germany, and Britain was not prepared to act alone. Thus, the Poles were able to keep Vilnius, where a provisional government (Komisja Rz\u0105dz\u0105ca Litwy \u015arodkowej, the Central Lithuanian Governing Commission) was formed. Soon parliamentary elections were held and the Wilno Diet (Sejm wile\u0144ski) voted on February 20, 1922, for incorporation into Poland as the capital of a Wilno Voivodship. The elections were not recognized by the League of Nations. The League of Nations Conference of Ambassadors accepted the status quo in 1923, but the Wilno region remained in dispute between Poland and Lithuania (the latter still treated Vilnius as its constitutional capital and the capital of the Vilnius region). In Poland, the Mutiny was supported by some groups, such as the Christian Democrats \"Wilno,\" in Rzeczpospolita (The Republic), October 11, 1920, p. 3. and the left, Tadeusz Ho\u0142\u00f3wko, \"Sp\u00f3r o Wilno\" (\"The Dispute over Wilno\"), in Robotnik (The Worker), October 28, 1920, p. 1. but criticized by the right-wing National Democrats. \"G\u0142osy w sprawie Wilna\" (\"Voices in the Matter of Wilno\"), in Kurjer Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), October 13, 1920, p. 8. The coup resulted in a serious rift between Pilsudski and Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who had played a major role in creating international support for the independence of Poland. According to historian Timothy Snyder, the annexation of Vilnius by Poles pushed Lithuanian politicians from political towards ethnic understanding of the nation and gave arguments to radical politicians in Lithuania and also in Poland. Lithuania refused to recognize Central Lithuania. Polish-Lithuanian relations began to normalize after League of Nations negotiations in 1927, but it was not until the 1938 ultimatum issued by Poland that Lithuania was forced to establish diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accept its neighbor's borders. The Polish- Lithuanian conflict, however, left worsened relations between the two countries for decades to come, and modern Vilnius is now part of Lithuania. ==See also== *Union for the Liberation of Vilnius *Perloja *Vilna offensive ==Notes== Category:Conflicts in 1920 Category:Mutinies Category:Lithuania\u2013Poland relations Category:1920 in Lithuania Category:1920 in Poland Category:1920 in Belarus Category:Republic of Central Lithuania Category:League of Nations Category:J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski Category:False flag operations ",
