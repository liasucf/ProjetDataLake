    "text": "Western Wall Tunnel riots erupted on 24 September, 1996 and lasted for three days, after Israel's opening of the controversial Western Wall Tunnel to the public, which led to the first violent conflict between the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and the Palestinian National Security Forces (NSF), which was authorized two years earlier, as a result of the Oslo Accords. In the riots which spread into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, 25 IDF soldiers were killed while dozens wounded, and nearly 100 Palestinians were killed while 1,000 wounded. ==Timeline== *Sept 24: The Western Wall is evacuated after Palestinians throw stones at Jewish worshippers.ARAB-ISRAEL CLASH LEAVES FIVE DEAD IN THE WEST BANK 26 Sept 1996, The New York Times. *Sept 25: Five Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured in Ramallah after Israeli soldiers opened fire.Ibid. *Sept 26: In Nablus, six Israeli soldiers died when Palestinians attacked their post at the Tomb of Joseph.
