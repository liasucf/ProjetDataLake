    "text": "Former Logo The Caribbean Maritime University (formerly Caribbean Maritime Institute) is a Jamaican public tertiary institution. The institution specializes in maritime education and training. Its primary campus is located on the Palisadoes Park, overlooking the Kingston Harbour. The Caribbean Maritime University (CMU) is by name, content and operation, the Caribbean region\u2019s centre of excellence for the training of professional seafarers and personnel in the shipping, logistics and supply chain management sectors. It was originally established as an Institute in 1980 by the Government of Jamaica in collaboration with the Government of the Kingdom of Norway initially to train Jamaican seafarers. in 1993 the organization became an autonomous body under the laws of Jamaica and within the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport in accordance with the JMI Act of 1992. By 2001, the need for giving the Institute its present international flavour, content, size and structure was demonstrated by changing its name from Jamaica Maritime Institute to Caribbean Maritime Institute (CMI). To be consistent with the name change, the CMI established satellites in other Caribbean countries for the dissemination and delivery of its land based programmes, having adapted its novel Blue Ocean Strategy. With the installation of its new administration in July 2006 and the adoption of the blue ocean strategy, the Institute has henceforth been focusing on: \u00b7 Satisfying the ever growing demand, locally and worldwide, for qualified seafarers, \u00b7 Exploring the inescapable link between land, sea ,air and the multifaceted demand from these; \u00b7 Seeking to expand beyond the maritime boundaries and cut across the multimodal transportation and logistics chain. Against the backdrop of the above, the Institute has restructured/expanded and continues to expand its curricula to educate and train people to fit-into the three transport sub sectors of land, sea and air. With the passing of the CMU Bill in 2017 and the subsequent CMU Act, the Caribbean Maritime Institute transitioned to the Caribbean Maritime University. Today, the CMU is a multiple accredited, multiple award winning university with a proven track record of producing industry ready graduates. https://srs.cmu.edu.jm/page/homepage ==External Links== Home Page: Caribbean Maritime University ==References== Category:Jamaica Category:Kingston, Jamaica ",
