It is located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). ==History== Cr\u00e9mines is first mentioned in 1461 as Crimene. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are several early medieval graves. For much of its history it was owned by the provost of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. During the Middle Ages and into the Early Modern era the Pr\u00e9 de Sales in Cr\u00e9mines was used as the dueling grounds for entire valley. In 1531 the village accepted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation along with the rest of the parish of Grandval. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Cr\u00e9mines became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Cr\u00e9mines was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Until about 1900, the local economy was still dominated by agriculture with a few cottage industries that manufactured pottery, watch parts and arquebuses. This began to change with the growth of the machinery manufacturing industry in nearby Moutier and the construction of the Solothurn-Moutier railroad in 1904-08. A number of industrial factories settled in Cr\u00e9mines and remained. Today over half of the working population is in the industrial sector. In 1972, a zoo opened in the municipality. ==Geography== Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1934) The entrance to the village and surrounding mountains Cr\u00e9mines has an area of .
