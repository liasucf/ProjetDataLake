Doc is warned by his Broadway cronies about gangster Vic Telli being released from prison. Doc's testimony had put Vic behind bars. Vic turns up, but impressed by Doc's honesty, says he is dying and asks Doc to find his long-missing daughter, Margie Dove, so he can bequeath her his fortune. Vic ends up dead with rival racketeer Jack Venner trying to get his money, assisted by a woman pretending to be Margie. In the end, Doc's life is saved by Connie going back out onto the ledge, tossing a shoe at the people below. The police nab the villain and Doc helps Connie back inside, but not before kissing her. == Cast == *Macdonald Carey as Dr. Timothy Kane / Dr. Broadway *Jean Phillips as Connie Madigan *Eduardo Ciannelli as Vic Telli *Richard Lane as Police Sgt.
