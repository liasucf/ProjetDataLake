It was open-air with a central administration building and classrooms extending out in a series of parallel wings to take advantage of the Florida weather by providing maximum natural light and exposure for each classroom. In July 1953, the school board chose Boca Ciega (after the nearby bay) as the school's name over Gulfport, Sunshine City, Sun City, Central, Gulf Coast, 58th Street, and Southwest St. Petersburg. Prospective students chose gold (for the Sun) and white (for sand) as the school colors and \"Rebels\" as the nickname. In September 1953, BCHS opened with 964 students in grades 9-12\\. The first principal, Richard L. Jones, declared there would be no \"rebels\" at his school; in another vote, students chose \"Pirates.\"Wilson, John \"Gulfport's Boca Ciega High to celebrate its golden run\" (May 19, 2004), St. Petersburg Times Ironically, Rebels was later adopted as the nickname of the school's cross-town rival, Dixie Hollins High School.
