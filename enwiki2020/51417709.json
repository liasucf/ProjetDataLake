Mottahedeh trained for the priesthood at United Theological College, Bangalore and was ordained a deacon in 1958 and a priest in 1960, while serving as curate at St Luke's Isfahan (the See church of the Diocese of Iran) from 1959 until 1962. He then served as vicar successively of three of the diocese's four churches \u2014 St Simon the Zealot, Shiraz (1963\u20131966); St Paul's, Tehran (1966\u20131974); and St Luke's, Isfahan (1975\u20131983) \u2014 before being appointed Archdeacon of Iran (1983\u20131985). On 11 June 1985, he was consecrated as Assistant Bishop in Iran. Following Hassan Dehqani-Tafti (diocesan Bishop in Iran)'s flight into exile (to the United Kingdom with his British wife) in 1980, Mottahedeh became the only priest in all Iran, and was unable to leave the country; upon Tafti's eventual retirement in 1990, Mottahedeh naturally succeeded him as diocesan Bishop in Iran. During his episcopate, he also served as President Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East (2000\u20132002); he retired in 2002 but continued to serve his diocese as Interim Bishop in Iran until 2004. He then retired to the UK, where he has been licensed since 2005 as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Lichfield (where he lives) and the neighbouring Diocese of Birmingham. ==References== Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:Persian people Category:1932 births Category:Bishops in Iran Category:Iranian Anglicans Category:Living people Category:Living assistant bishops in the Church of England Category:Iranian Christians Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Anglican bishops ",
