He then remained in Primavera (literally, Spring) as an overage player. After Mantova finished in 20th place, was relegated and suffered bankruptcy, Mendy was released. Mendy was without a club for on season. It was due to FIGC allowed non-EU players to join youth teams if they joined Italy with reason other than football (family union, education, etc.), they were not allowed to play as a professional player in Italy (age above 20). He trialled at Nocerina in July 2010. On 5 August 2011, he was signed by Serie A club Parma and left for Pro Vercelli along with Angelo Bencivenga. However the deal collapsed. On 19 August he left for fellow top division club A.S. Roma for \u20ac150,000 on a one- year contract. On 26 August he was sold to Brussels on free transfer, along with Parma two weeks \"teammate\" Sulaiman Sesay Fullah, who was also unable to register in Italy. The transaction also allowed Roma to fulfil the non-EU registration quota. After one season at Brussels, he moved to newly promoted Waasland-Beveren. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Sportspeople from Dakar Category:Association football midfielders Category:Senegalese footballers Category:Mantova 1911 S.S.D. players Category:Parma Calcio 1913 players Category:US Gor\u00e9e players Category:R.W.D.M.
