And why did you form the Chorale?\" The first > question is indeed flattering; however, just the opposite is true. Singers > hypnotize me, especially when they are good. The second question can best be > answered, I think, by telling something about the Chorale. Every Monday > evening 200 singers converge on the Chorale studios to do one thing...sing. > They sing choral masterworks, large and small, and find the experience good. > School teachers, salesmen, housewives, executives, factory workers, > students, professional musicians and others from all walks of life and from > distances up to a hundred miles, come with one aim of trying to produce fine > choral singing.
