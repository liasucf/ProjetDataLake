    "text": "Sagephora phortegella is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1888. This species is endemic to New Zealand. The wingspan is 8\u201313 mm. The forewings are ochreous-white, the dorsal half suffusedly streaked with whitish-ochreous. There is a thick, gradually- dilated, blackish streak along the costa from base to three-fourths, the apex pointed, the lower margin with a slight projection before the middle. There is sometimes an irregular blackish line below the middle from near the base parallel to the inner and hind-margins to the apex, and a similar almost marginal line along the inner margin to the anal angle, then as a hindmarginal streak to the apex, where it is confluent with the first. Sometimes, there is a defined narrow blackish streak along the inner margin, and a moderate blackish hindmarginal fascia attenuated at the extremities. The hindwings are grey or whitish-grey, rarely rather dark grey. ==References== ==External links== *Image of type specimen of Sagephora phortegella. *Citizen science observations and photographs Category:Moths described in 1888 Category:Tineidae Category:Moths of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by Edward Meyrick ",
