It is notable for the recent incarnations of the Star Trek franchise with Roddenberry Entertainment. == History == In 2014, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci announced that they would dissolve the partnership in motion pictures in order to focus, solely, on television. Later that year, the company signed a three-year production deal with Universal Pictures to produce its feature films. Secret Hideout's first film was The Mummy. They hired Jeb Brody, who was formerly an employee of Focus Features, and Bobby Cohen, who was a former K/O staffer to join the company, along with Kim Rosen, who is serving as head of digital and interactive. In 2016, it was announced that Roberto Orci was not attached to CBS All Access' revival of Star Trek: Discovery, and insists that they signed a new deal with CBS Television Studios, to launch its television division, with Star Trek: Discovery being one of the first projects the studio is producing for television, along with Salvation. They hired K/O staffers Heather Kadin and Aaron Baiers to join the company to manage its TV shows. In 2018, they signed a new deal with CBS Television Studios to expand the Star Trek franchise with new incarnations. In 2019, Robyn Johnson was hired as a development executive for Secret Hideout. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" |Release !style=\"background:#c0c0c0\"|TV and Internet !!Film |- !2017 | colspan=\"2\" |The Mummy |- ! scope=\"col\" |2017\u20132018 | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Salvation |- ! scope=\"col\" |2017\u2013present | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Star Trek: Discovery |- ! scope=\"col\" |2018\u2013present | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Star Trek: Short Treks |- ! scope=\"col\" |2018\u20132019 | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Instinct |- ! scope=\"col\" |2020\u2013present | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Star Trek: Picard |- ! scope=\"col\" |2020 | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Star Trek: Lower Decks |- ! scope=\"col\" |2020 | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |The Comey Rule |- ! scope=\"col\" |2021 | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Star Trek: Prodigy |- ! scope=\"col\" |TBA | colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#c0c0c0\" |Clarice |- |} == References == == External links == * Secret Hideout on IMDb Category:Film production companies of the United States Category:Television production companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 2014 Category:Entertainment companies established in 2014 Category:Companies based in Beverly Hills, California Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:2014 establishments in California ",
