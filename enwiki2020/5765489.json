He spent seven years at FC Barcelona between 1923 and 1930. During that time he won six Campionat de Catalunya titles, three Copa del Rey and the first ever La Liga title. The poem Oda A Platko came about following the Copa del Rey final in 1928. FC Barcelona took three games to beat Real Sociedad and during the first encounter on 20 May, Rafael Alberti was so impressed with the bravery of Platko that he later wrote the poem in his honour. Platko finished his playing career at Recreativo de Huelva and retired as a player in 1931. He soon began his career as a coach, working in France with FC Mulhouse (1932\u201333) and Racing Club de Roubaix (1933\u201334), before returning to FC Barcelona as a coach for the 1934/35 season. Despite guiding the club to another Campionat de Catalunya, the following season he was replaced by Patrick O'Connell. After two decades away from the club Platko was reappointed coach of CF Barcelona for the 1955/56 season. During this season the club, inspired by Ladislao Kubala and Luis Su\u00e1rez, won 10 consecutive La Liga games in a row. The record remained unbeaten until 2005.

For the season 1955/56 he returned to FC Barcelona with which he became runner up in the league one point behind Athletic Bilbao. His balance of 22 wins three draws and five defeats had been the best for the club yet. The series of ten straight wins in the league was only outdone under Frank Rijkard in the 2005/06 season. His downfall was a 1\u20133 defeat on 20 May in the cup quarterfinals against local rivals Espa\u00f1ol. The club concluded, the relationship between the team and Plattk\u00f3 was broken, and replaced him for the return match, which ended 4-4, with the club legend Josep Samitier.
