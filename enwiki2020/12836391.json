Biographer Craig Mathieson described the imagery of the chair as symbolising \"the hard, even impenetrable male edge, that [the song's character] had with his girlfriend\". ==Reception== You Am I biographer Craig Mathieson praised the song's lyrics for revealing a character that \"admit[s] they're flawed, but still swear[s] their strength, support [and] love\". He praises the band's musical performance for \"increas[ing] the momentum with every verse, adding vigour and desperation to Tim's emotion. ... Berlin Chair leaves me drained and elated.\" Double J rated the song as the best Australian song of the 90s, saying, \"In a way, it defies description. It bears little resemblance to any other song. It isn\u2019t traditionally catchy, yet it won\u2019t leave your head from the moment you hear those first lines.\" Junkee said, \"It's a song of codependency, trust and endearing love through one another's flaws. It\u2019s the kind of song any self- respecting band, genre regardless, would have fucking killed to have written.\" ==Track listing== # \"Berlin Chair\" - 2:34 # \"Can't Explain\" - 2:10 # \"Jaimme (Makers Mark Version)\" - 2:40 # \"All I Want To Do Is Rock\" - 5:42 All songs by Tim Rogers, except 2 (Pete Townshend) and 4 (Ross Wilson) \"Can't Explain\" is a cover of \"I Can't Explain\" by The Who. \"Jaimme (Makers Mark Version)\" is an acoustic version of \"Jaimme's Got A Gal\". \"All I Want To Do Is Rock\" is a cover of the Mighty Kong song. ==Cover versions== Australian band Kisschasy did a cover version of the song for their 2007 single release of \"Opinions Won't Keep You Warm At Night\".
