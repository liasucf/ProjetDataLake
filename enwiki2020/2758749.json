On February 3, 1979, he was traded by the Angels along with Brad Havens, Paul Hartzell and Ken Landreaux to the Minnesota Twins for Rod Carew. He played catcher, first base, third base, outfield and designated hitter. In the minor leagues, Engle won the International League batting title in 1980, beating out Wade Boggs .307 to .306. Four years later, he was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1984. During his sophomore season, Engle became the first player to hit a home run in Minneapolis's newly opened Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. This occurred on opening day, April 6, 1982 and also marked the first hit, run scored, and R.B.I. in the stadium's history. Engle is the brother in-law of his former Twins teammate, Tom Brunansky. ==References== ==External links== , or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American League All-Stars Category:Baltimore Orioles scouts Category:Baseball coaches from California Category:Baseball players from California Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Houston Astros coaches Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Major League Baseball hitting coaches Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:New York Mets coaches Category:New York Mets scouts Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Salinas Angels players Category:Sportspeople from San Diego Category:Tigres de Aragua players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Tucson Toros players Category:University of Southern California alumni Category:USC Trojans baseball players ",
