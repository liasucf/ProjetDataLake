After losing his sight as a child, he entered a School for the Blind in Brussels, where he received music education. Gifted with a great affinity for music, he was contacted by the Brussels harmonium-builders Merklin & Sch\u00fctz, and became a master of the instrument. He was noted for his understanding of the registers and effects, and for his improvisations. He was later appointed Professor of Harmonium in the Conservatoire. He died from typhoid in Ixelles, one of the many victims of the 1869 outbreak. ==Works== His published works include: * M\u00e9thode pour harmonium (Brussels, 1859) * Three melodies for harmonium (Brussels, 1857) * Pastoral (Brussels, 1858) * Caprice (Brussels, 1858) * 6 Compositions pour harmonium (Brussels, Schott Fr\u00e8res, n.d.) * Trois M\u00e9ditations pour Harmonium (Brussels, J.B.
