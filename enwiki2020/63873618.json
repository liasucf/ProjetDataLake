Within the same framework, Congress began to discuss a bill to allow contributors to the Private Pension System to have 25% of their contributions to combat the crisis; However, Minister Alva was against the bill because in order to achieve this, the Pension Fund Administrators Association (AFP) would have to sell assets to obtain liquidity. The minister even said that at one extreme, this measure could break the financial system. On 25 June, congressmen from Uni\u00f3n por el Per\u00fa and Frente Amplio reached the required accessions to present an appeal to Minister Alva to present the results of the economic and reactivation measures implemented by the government. Peru's gross domestic product fell 30.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of economic lockdown measures, the largest decline of all major economies, with many small service businesses that represent the majority of businesses of Peru's economy going bankrupt during the crisis. Employment also dropped 40 percent compared to the previous rate while the Peruvian government approved 128 billion PEN ($35.8 billion USD) of tax relief and low-rate business loans to deter further economic decline. A motion for the interpellation of Alva was approved by the Congress of Peru on 24 August 2020, with the motion describing measures taken by the government as a \"failure\". ==References== Category:1985 births Category:People from Lima Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of the Pacific (Peru) alumni Category:John F.
