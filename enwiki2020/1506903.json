    "text": "Navistar International Corporation is an American holding company created in 1986 as the successor to International Harvester. Navistar operates as the owner of International brand of trucks and diesel engines. The company also produces military vehicles through its Navistar Defense subsidiary along with bus production through IC Bus. Currently, Traton SE (formerly Volkswagen Truck and Bus) is the largest stakeholder of Navistar, owning 17% of the company. Headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, the company has 13,000 employees worldwide as of 2019. Navistar operates through a network of nearly 1,000 dealer outlets in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico and more than 60 dealers in 90 countries throughout the world. The company also provides financing for its customers and distributors principally through its wholly owned subsidiary, Navistar Financial Corporation. ==History== Navistar International headquarters building in Lisle, IL. ===1902\u20131985: International Harvester=== The merger of McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and the Deering Harvester Company in 1902 resulted in the formation of the International Harvester Company (IH) of Chicago, Illinois. In 1908, International introduced the International Harvester Auto Wagon, a forerunner of the pickup truck. Over the next three-quarters of the 20th century, the company evolved to become a diversified manufacturer within the agricultural and construction industries and produced vehicles ranging from the Scout and Travelall light trucks to heavy commercial trucks and buses. Other brands associated with the company include Farmall and Cub Cadet. ===1985\u20131991: Transition from agricultural roots=== International Harvester fell on hard times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mid-1980s and the effects of a long strike with the UAW over proposed work rule changes. IH's new CEO, Donald Lennox, directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its IH's historical business sectors in an effort to survive. Some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for short-term survival, while other divisions were sold due to a lack of immediate profitability. During this period of questionable economic survival, in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses, the management team led by Mr. Lennox at IH shed many of its operating divisions: Construction Equipment Division to Dresser Industries; Solar (gas turbines) Division to Caterpillar; Cub Cadet (lawn and garden equipment) to MTD Products. For the 1983 model year, the Engine Division began production of 6.9L IDI V8 diesel engines for Ford full-size pickup trucks and vans; the supply agreement would last through 2010. At the beginning of 1985, the Agricultural Division was acquired by Tenneco, leaving the final pieces of International Harvester as the Truck and Engine Divisions. The IHC name and logo were assets of the Agricultural Division and were consequently part of the sale. The parent company of rival Case Corporation, Tenneco created the merged Case IH (continuing the IH brand to this day). In response to the sale of its own brand and logo, International Harvester reintroduced itself on February 20, 1986, as Navistar International Corporation. To this day, the \"International\" brand name is used by the product lines of the International Truck and Engine Corporation (the previous Truck and Engine Division). ===1990s-early 2000s: Rediversification=== In 1991, the final remnant of International in the automotive segment was sold off, as the Scout and Light Truck parts business was sold to Scout/Light Line Distributors, Inc. During the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of diesel engines had made Navistar a leading manufacturer of bus chassis, particularly school buses. The company purchased one-third of American Transportation Corporation (AmTran), an Arkansas-based manufacturer in 1991, and the remaining two-thirds in April 1995. By becoming both a body and chassis manufacturer at the same time, Navistar gained significant market share in the industry. During the 1994 model year, the T444E engine replaced the IDI diesel in Ford vehicles; still supplied by Navistar, the 7.3L V8 turbodiesel adopted the PowerStroke branding for Ford vehicles. ===2000s=== After nearly a century of business in Chicago, Navistar announced its plans on 30 September 2000 to leave the city and relocate its corporate offices to west suburban Warrenville, Illinois. In 2002, AmTran was rebranded as IC (Integrated Coach) after a few months as International Truck and Bus. In 2001, International introduced the first \"NGV\" trucks, its first completely new truck design since the 1986 introduction of Navistar. Initially using the \"Thousand\"-series nomenclature, in 2008, the NGV trucks adopted -\"Star\" branding (only the 9000-series remained). XT pickup trucks In 2004, Navistar re-entered the retail vehicle market for the first time since 1980, with the International XT (Extreme Truck) series. Three pickup trucks were sold; two of the three versions (CXT and RXT) were International Durastar medium-duty trucks (fitted with Ford F-350 pickup beds). The third version (the MXT) was essentially a street-legal version of the Navistar-designed International MXT-MV military vehicle. (By far) the largest vehicles ever sold for consumer sale, the XT series was sold through the 2008 model year. In 2005, Navistar purchased the Workhorse company (started in 1998 by investors who took over production and sales of General Motors\u2019 popular P-series Stepvan chassis when GM dropped it), a manufacturer of step-van and motor home chassis, to seemingly re-enter the delivery van market. It appeared that the new subsidiary might also benefit by its association with a company whose history from the 1930s into the '60s included the popular Metro van. For a short time Workhorse offered an integrated chassis-body product called MetroStar. In Sept. of 2012, Navistar announced the shut down of Workhorse and the closure of the plant in Union City, Indiana, in order to cut costs. Workhorse has since repositioned itself as a manufacturer of electrically powered trucks and delivery vans. ====2001 shooting==== On February 5, 2001, the company's Melrose Park facility was the site of a workplace shooting. 66-year-old William D. Baker opened fire with an AK-47 killing four co-workers and injuring four more before turning the gun on himself. Baker was just a day away from incarceration for stealing from his ex-employer. === 2010s-present === ====Move to Lisle, Illinois==== In September 2010, despite uncertainty over EGR and a sluggish economy, Navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from Warrenville, IL, to nearby Lisle, IL. The new headquarters was expected to retain or create 3,000 permanent jobs and about 400 construction jobs. Navistar President Dan Ustian said roughly 500 engineers would be hired immediately. Navistar aimed to invest $110 million in the 1.2 million-square- foot Lisle campus, which would include product development. The state gave Navistar incentives of nearly $65 million, including tax credits. In March 2011, Navistar announced the move to Lisle. Renovations were completed in the fall, but the company gradually moved from Warrenville to Lisle in summer 2011. \"You can't build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this, and even though you might get more incentives, when you look at the whole picture, you really can't beat it,\" said Don Sharp, Navistar vice president. In 2011, Navistar began phasing out its Truck Development and Technology Center (TDTC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In early December 2011, the company laid off 130 employees, mostly engineers and designers who were United Auto Workers members. In total, 300 out of 1,400 Fort Wayne employees eventually accepted offers to relocate to Illinois. The other 1,100 workers either retired or chose to remain in Indiana and find work elsewhere. The cost to move employees and consolidate operations was estimated to be $75 million. The only Navistar employees remaining after December 2012 were 20-25 people manning the company's test track on Oxford Street. In late July 2015, the TDTC closed and the remaining workers were let go. ====Tension Mounts==== In June 2012, speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker. This came as hedge fund MHR Fund Management LLC disclosed a 13.6% stake in the company, slightly higher than billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn's 11.9% stake. As a result, Navistar adopted a poison pill defense. If the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of 15 percent or more in the company, then Navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of 50 percent: For each share held, the investor could buy $280 worth of new shares for $140. The investor who took the 15 percent stake or more would not have the right to buy additional shares. In August 2012, Navistar announced it would use Cummins engines and SCR technology. After 37 years with the company, Dan Ustian retired immediately in August 2012 and left his position on the board as well. Former Textron CEO Lewis Campbell was named interim CEO and Troy Clarke was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Ustian's severance package began at $7.9 million. The company's proxy statement during this time estimated the total package to be $14.6 million, contingent on a share price of $42.07 on Oct. 31, 2011, the end of the company's fiscal year. On September 9, 2012, billionaire and key stock holder Carl Icahn sent an open letter to Navistar's board, blasting them for \"abysmal business decisions\" and \"poor corporate governance.\" Icahn noted from 2009 to 2012, that \"this Board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers, competitors and regulators, marketing plans to convince customers that non- compliant engines are actually compliant, accumulating non-core assets such as a Recreational Vehicle manufacturer, and a \"gold-plated\" corporate headquarters that cost over $100 million. The one thing this Board refused to spend money on was a back-up plan involving the industry standard technology Navistar now must rely on.\" In a September 2012 interview, Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger said, \"all we did was act nice to them (Navistar) even when they didn't talk nicely about us,\" he smiled, recalling harsh comments that Navistar executives had made about SCR being used by all its competitors. In October 2012, Chief Product Officer Deepak Kapur stepped down, followed by Group Vice President of Product Development Ramin Younessi in December 2012. CIO Don Sharp also left the company in April 2013. ====Layoffs and consolidation==== August 2012 featured a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) as well as involuntary layoffs. This was due to the failed engine strategy, rising warranty costs and declines in commercial and military sales. The company let go 500 employees and in September 2012, announced plans to lay off 200 more salaried employees. In addition, the company announced it would close its Garland, Texas manufacturing facility by mid-2013, resulting in the loss of 900 jobs. In March 2013, Navistar announced that interim CEO Lewis Campbell would step down and COO Troy Clarke would be named CEO and Chairman of the Board. Jack Allen was named COO. In June 2013, CFO A.J. Cederoth stepped down and James M. Moran, Navistar senior vice president, and treasurer, would act as interim CFO until a successor could be found. In late June 2013, former General Motors executive Walter Borst was named Executive VP and CFO. In September 2013, Navistar announced it would cut 500 more jobs amid a larger than expected third-quarter loss. Navistar reported a slower than expected return to profitability due to large market share losses, declining sales, and weak market conditions. In May 2014, a third round of lay-offs in as many years occurred at the corporate headquarters as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures. On July 31, 2015, Navistar ceased operations and laid off the remaining 15 employees at the Truck Development and Technology Center (TDTC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In November 2015 and December 2015, several hundred Navistar employees voluntarily left the Corporate HQ office in Lisle, IL, as part of another Voluntary Separation Package (VSP). ====Cost-cutting and divestitures==== As part of the turnaround plan, Navistar executives cut costs aggressively. They cut SG&A; costs by 16% in 2013 and cut product development spending by 24%. Interim CEO Lewis Campbell's priorities included a focus on quality, reducing the company's cost structure and paring back its product line. Navistar also sold several businesses that it deemed were not providing enough of a Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Among them were their Monaco Coach Corporation Recreational Vehicle (RV) business as well as Workhorse Chassis. They also exited their joint venture with Mahindra and sold off their E-Z Pack unit, which made bodies for garbage trucks, as well as its Continental Mixer unit, which made concrete mixers, for prices the company characterized as \"not material.\" In January 2014, Forbes reported several key challenges facing Navistar, which include declining military sales, a pension plan underfunded by $2.7 billion, two self-disclosed weaknesses in accounting practices and a new collective bargaining agreement for the company's 6,000 full and part-time workers who are represented by labor unions. In February 2014, Navistar announced it would move some engine production operations from Huntsville, AL, to Melrose Park, IL by summer 2014. The move eliminated 280 jobs in Alabama and saved an estimated $22 million. Navistar said it would keep two other diesel engine plants operating in Huntsville. In September 2014, Navistar reported its best quarter in years. It announced a third- quarter net loss of $2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a third-quarter 2013 net loss of $247 million, or $3.06 per diluted share. It was also in September that CEO Troy Clarke announced that the company's biggest divestitures were complete, and that the focus would now be on regaining lost market share. On November 6, 2014, leadership changes continued at Navistar, with Executive VP and COO Jack Allen retiring immediately. Rather than hire a new COO, CEO Troy Clarke split the COO duties among three other executives. ==== GM and Navistar Reach Commercial Vehicle Agreement ==== General Motors Co. and Navistar have reached a long-term agreement to develop and assemble future medium-duty, conventional cab Class 4/5 commercial vehicles, allowing Navistar to strengthen its product lineup and GM to expand its Chevrolet commercial truck portfolio. The future trucks will be jointly developed using Navistar's expertise in rolling chassis configurations and manufacturing capabilities, and GM's commercial components and engines. The vehicles entered production in late 2018 and are manufactured at Navistar's facility in Springfield, Ohio. ====Strategic partnership with Traton SE==== In September 2016, Navistar and Volkswagen Truck and Bus (now called Traton), the subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group that controls European heavy truck makers MAN and Scania, announced their intent to pursue a strategic technology collaboration and to establish a procurement joint venture. Volkswagen Truck & Bus would take a 16.6% stake in Navistar, in return for an investment of $256 million. Navistar expects to realize cumulative synergies of $500 million over the first five years. In March 2017 it was announced that Volkswagen Truck & Bus's 16.6% equity investment in Navistar became effective from February 28, 2017, with Volkswagen Truck & Bus executives Andreas Renschler and Matthias Gr\u00fcndler joining the Navistar Board of Directors. On January 30, 2020, Traton announced a proposal to purchase all outstanding shares in Navistar. ==Corporate operations== ===International Trucks (1986-present)=== DuraStar Box (van body) truck International LT International WorkStar (vacuum truck) In 1986, after the transition from International Harvester to Navistar, the truck product line (essentially all that was left) dropped the \"Harvester\" portion of the brand name. The International brand encompasses a variety of medium- duty, over-the-road, and severe-service trucks. ;Medium Duty * International CV Series (also produced as Chevrolet Silverado C6500 HD) * International MV Series ;Heavy Duty * International LoneStar * International LT Series * International RH Series ;Severe Duty * International HX Series * International HV Series ===IC Bus (2002-present)=== IC Bus AC-Series (International TerraStar) shuttle bus International has a long history in the school bus industry as a chassis provider, dating to when school buses first became motorized. In 1991, Navistar entered the school bus industry as a body manufacturer when it began its acquisition of AmTran, an Arkansas-based company founded as Ward Body Works in 1933. Today, IC Bus produces several models of full-sized school buses along with buses for commercial use. ;School/activity buses * CE-Series conventional (International 3300 chassis) * RE-Series rear-engine transit-style (International 3000 chassis) ;Commercial buses * CE-Series conventional (International 3300 chassis) * RE-Series rear- engine transit-style (International 3000 chassis) * TC-Series chassis (International 3300 chassis) ===MWM International Motores (2005-present)=== In 2005, Navistar purchased MWM International Motores, a Brazilian engine manufacturer formerly associated with Deutz AG. ===Engines (1986-present)=== In 1986, Navistar was formed from the engine division of the former International Harvester (alongside the truck division). In a continuation from its predecessor, International produced both gasoline and diesel-fueled engines for its medium-duty trucks and some heavy-duty trucks, offering second-party engines as an option. Class 8 trucks offered second-party diesel engines (from Caterpillar, Cummins, and Detroit Diesel). From International Harvester, International inherited production of the SV-series gasoline V8, IDI diesel V8, DV-series diesel V8, and DT466 inline-6. After 1986, the production of gasoline engines ended, shifting to diesel-powered engines entirely. During the 1980s, Navistar began an expansion of its engine families. For 1986, a 7.3L version of the IDI was introduced; the engine supplanted the long-running DV-series V8 by the end of 1988; the same year, it became an option in Ford trucks. For 1987, the DT inline-6 engine family was expanded to a second engine, as the DT360 was introduced (competing directly against the Cummins 6BT). During 1994 production, the IDI V8 was replaced by the direct-injection T444E V8, sharing little more than its displacement with its predecessor; the T444E became the first Ford PowerStroke engine. While the DT360 was withdrawn (largely replaced by the T444E), the DT466 (now the DT466E) was joined by the larger DT530E (competing primarily against the Cummins C8.3). For the 2000s, International began developing engines to comply with updated emissions standards for commercial vehicles. During 2003, the T444E was discontinued and replaced the VT engine family, introduced by the VT365 V8. For 2004, the DT engines received modernized fuel injection and a redesigned turbocharger; the DT530 was replaced by the DT570 (sized between the Caterpillar C9 and the Cummins ISL). In place of using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to treat engine emissions, International adopted Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), a configuration used with success in automobiles with gasoline engines. For 2007 emissions compliance, International launched the \"MaxxForce\" branding for its diesel engines. The VT engine family consisted of the 4.5L MaxxForce 5 V6 and the 6.4L MaxxForce 7 V8 (replacing the VT365). The DT466 became the MaxxForceDT, with the DT and HT570 becoming the MaxxForce 9 and 10, respectively. For its Class 8 trucks, the company introduced \"large- bore\" engines for the first time, introducing the 10.5L MaxxForce 11 and the 12.4L MaxxForce 13. After the 2010 model year, Ford ended its engine supply agreement with International, continuing the PowerStroke range under its own designs. The MaxxForce 7 and DT engines were updated with twin turbochargers to improve emissions compliance. Following several years of difficulty reliably matching 2007 and 2010 emissions compliance, International chose to end diesel engine production following the 2015 model year, replacing the MaxxForce 7 and MaxxForceDT with the Cummins ISB6.7 and ISL9, respectively. In 2017, International reentered the diesel engine production segment, launching the A26 12.4L inline-6. Largely serving as a company-produced successor to the MaxxForce 13, the A26 was developed from the MAN D26 engine. ===Plug-in electric vehicles=== eStar electric van in Los Angeles in 2010. The vehicle was manufactured in the U.S. under license from Modec. eStar delivery truck in Washington, D.C. in 2012 ====Plug-in hybrid electric bus==== The U.S. Department of the Energy announced in 2009 the selection of Navistar Corporation for a cost-shared award of up to million to develop, test, and deploy plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) school buses. The project aims to deploy 60 vehicles for a three-year period in school bus fleets across the nation. The vehicles will be capable of running in either electric-only or hybrid modes that can be recharged from standard electrical outlets. Because electricity will be their primary fuel, they will consume less petroleum than standard vehicles. To develop the PHEV school bus, Navistar will examine a range of hybrid architectures and evaluate advanced energy storage devices, with the goal of developing a vehicle with a range. Travel beyond the range will be facilitated by a clean diesel engine capable of running on renewable fuels. The DOE funding will cover up to half of the project's cost and will be provided over three years, subject to annual appropriations. ====eStar electric van==== The eStar was an all-electric van. Production began in March 2010 and first deliveries began two months later via its Workhorse Group division. The technology used in eStar was licensed to Navistar in 2009 in a joint venture with Modec and Navistar bought the intellectual property rights from the Modec's bankruptcy administrators in 2011. The introduction of the eStar was supported by a million U.S. Department of Energy stimulus grant under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The eStar had a payload capacity available with a 14- or 16-foot cargo box. The vehicle was powered by a 70 kW 102 hp electric motor powered by an 80kWhr lithium-ion battery pack supplied by A123 Systems, and also used regenerative braking. The electric van had a range of , and a full charge took between 6 and 8 hours. By May 2010 the eStar had received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and CARB certifications. The eStar also met all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The first vans were delivered in May 2010 to FedEx Express for use in Los Angeles. Other customers included Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;), The Coca-Cola Company, and Canada Post. The eStar had a price of . Navistar discontinued the eStar van in March 2013, as part of a corporate restructuring plan to focus on current profitability. ===Navistar Defense LLC (2003-present)=== International MaxxPro MRAP In October 2003, Navistar CEO Dan Ustian announced the company would be forming a defense business unit in order to sell military vehicles. Navistar Defense would be led by Archie Massicotte, a 26-year veteran of the company. Ustian stated \"This is a natural area of growth for International. We already have all the platforms that the U.S. military and other NATO countries could leverage for products and services.\" In 2007, Navistar's International Truck and Engine Corporation became the first company to enter hybrid commercial truck production, with the International DuraStar Hybrid diesel-electric truck.International Truck and Engine First Company to Enter Hybrid Commercial Truck Production, November 9, 2007, Fuerteventura Digital Navistar Defense LLC is the prime supplier of MRAP armored vehicles to the US military. The Navistar 7000 series has been fielded by the Canadian Forces for domestic operations. In 2005, the U.S. Army ordered 2,900 7000-MVs for the Afghan National Army and Iraqi Ministry of Defense and an additional order of 7,000 was added in 2008. Navistar Defense also has a small Canadian branch, named Navistar Defence Canada. Navistar Defense reported sales of $3.9 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2009. In October 2009, the company entered into a strategic agreement with Czech-based company Tatra to jointly develop, produce and market new military vehicles. In December 2009, analysts were skeptical of the company's long-term potential. \"Navistar came out of nowhere and became a big player with MRAP, in what was a short-term program,\" said Dean Lockwood, an analyst at Forecast International Inc., a Connecticut-based defense consultant. \"They didn't prove themselves to be a long-term major player.\" In 2010, Navistar Defense's sales were $1.8 billion. The company's 2010 Annual 10K report stated \"we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual sales.\" In 2011, Navistar Defense's sales were $2.0 billion. In 2012, Navistar Defense reported $1.0 billion in sales. Business Insider ranked Navistar Defense at 22 in the top 25 US defense companies. In 2013, Navistar Defense reported $543 million in sales. In the company's 10K filing, they projected military sales to continue to decline, citing U.S. budgetary constraints.In 2014, we expect our U.S. military sales to continue to decline. Contributing to the decline are the budgetary constraints experienced by the U.S. government. In 2014, Navistar Defense reported $149 million in sales. The company projected 2015 military sales to be slightly higher due to recent contract awards relating to the government's MRAP fleet. In 2015, Navistar Defense reported $203 million in sales. The 2015 military sales primarily consisted of refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to \u201clike new\u201d condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. The company projected 2016 sales to be slightly higher than 2015 due to a recent new vehicle contract award, additional refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles and technical support services. In 2016's annual report, Navistar Defense reported $198 million in sales. The 2016 military sales primarily consisted of deliveries of MILCOT variants to foreign militaries, refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to \u201clike new\u201d condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. In 2017, ND said they expect their U.S. military sales to be consistent with 2016 as their contract backlog consists of a similar mix of products as that of 2016.In 2017, we expect our U.S. military sales to be consistent with 2016 as our contract backlog consists of a similar mix of products as that of 2016. ====Subpoena from U.S. DOD Inspector General==== In third-quarter 2016, Navistar Defense said it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Defense Inspector General asking for documents related to the sale of some independent suspension systems to the government. Navistar Defense said it would comply. The subpoena is related to the independent suspension systems sold for military vehicles between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2010. On June 3, 2016, ND met with government representatives, including representatives from DOD IG and the U.S. Department of Justice, to discuss the matter. ND made submissions of documents responsive to the subpoena in June and August 2016 and has substantially completed its subpoena response. ====Contract awards, losses and other events==== On August 22, 2012, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Engineering, Manufacturing & Development (EMD) contract worth $187 million for the Army and Marine Corps' Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program. Navistar had proposed its Saratoga vehicle for the competition. On Friday, August 28, 2012, Navistar filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) but pulled their protest on Tuesday, September 4, 2012. ====2013==== On June 20, 2013, Navistar Defense idled production at their West Point, MS production plant. 80 workers were notified that July 5, 2013, would be their last day. West Point was best known for manufacturing MRAP vehicles. The company cited sequestration, the drawdown in Afghanistan and a challenging environment in the defense industry as factors. On August 22, 2013, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) 1.1 contract, potentially valued at $562 million. Navistar had proposed its Special Operations Tactical Vehicle (SOTV) for the competition. On Tuesday September 1, 2013, Navistar Defense and AM General filed a protest. On December 19, 2013, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied Navistar and AM General's protests. ====2014==== In January 2014, the Pentagon announced they had notified allies of their intent to give away or scrap 13,000 used MRAPs. This was due to the war in Afghanistan winding down, the military wanting a lighter vehicle and high cost to ship them from the Middle East back to the U.S. Recipients have included various police departments and some universities. Navistar Defense built 9,000 of the 27,000 vehicles bought by the Pentagon. Giving away the MRAPs was seen as a blow to Navistar Defense's parts sales. In December 2014, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Engineering, Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for the Armored Multi- Purpose Vehicle (AMPV). BAE was awarded the $382 million contract on December 23, 2014. Navistar Defense lost their bid for Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) MSVS (Medium Support Vehicle System) Project - SMP (Standard Military Pattern) vehicle contracts. They proposed their ATX8 vehicle as part of an agreement with Czech-based company Tatra. The contract was for acquisition and in-service support (ISS) of a fleet of up to 1,500 SMP vehicles, up to 150 Armour Protection Systems (APS) kits, and 300 Load Handling System (LHS) trailers. Competitors include Oshkosh (MTVR), BAE Systems (FMTV), Daimler AG (Zetros), Renault Trucks (Kerax 8x8) and Rheinmetall/ MAN (HX77 8x8). A contract award decision is expected in June 2015. On July 16, 2015, Canada awarded the Acquisition and In-Service Support contracts to Mack Defense, LLC (Renault Trucks). On July 25, 2014, the DOD awarded a $27.6 million modification to an existing contract to acquire mine- resistant, ambush-protected hardware kits to upgrade MaxxPro Dash and long- wheelbase ambulances to their final configuration. Estimated completion date is May 30, 2015. On August 27, 2014, the DOD awarded a $38 million contract to Navistar Defense to restore MRAP Maxx Pro Dash vehicles to \"like-new\" standards. The DOD reported that Navistar was the only bidder. The work includes adding independent suspension systems and replacement of mandatory parts, with an estimated completion date of June 30, 2016. Work will be performed in West Point, MS. In September 2014, Navistar Defense announced they would hire 200 workers and re-open operations at their West Point, MS production plant. West Point had been idle since June 2013 due to sequestration, the drawdown in Afghanistan and declining orders. In September 2014, amidst numerous divestitures, Navistar Inc. CEO Troy Clark gave Navistar Defense a vote of confidence, noting that the military business unit would be retained. In a September 2014 interview with Reuters, he said \"it's not a billion-dollar growth opportunity, but it's not something that\u2019s bleeding off the future fortunes of our company.\" On October 14, 2014, Navistar Defense was awarded a $9.2 million firm-fixed-price foreign military sale (FMS) contract to Jordan for one hundred 4-ton 4x4 cargo trucks and twenty days of operator and maintenance training.

In 2015, a joint venture between the two companies for development of a new Class 4/5 commercial vehicle was announced. In early 2017, Navistar's truck assembly plant in Springfield, Ohio, began production of cutaway van chassis variants of the GMT610 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana. Further details around the Chevy Silverado 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD were announced by General Motors early in 2018, with Navistar also unveiling the International-branded variant of the truck, the CV series, shortly thereafter. Production started in late 2018. The truck serves as a successor to the previously discontinued Chevrolet Kodiak and International TerraStar, competing against the Ford Super Duty F-450/F-550/F-600 and Ram Chassis Cab. ====Tatra==== Tatra and Navistar Defence introduced at Eurosatory Exposition in Paris, France (June 14\u201318, 2010) the results of their strategic alliance since October 2009, the models ATX6 (universal container carrier) and ATX8 (troop carrier) The vehicles appear to be based on Tatra T815-7 (T817) 6x6, 8x8 chassis, suspension and cabins while using Navistar engines and other components. Under the deal Navistar Defence and Tatra A.S. will market the vehicles in North America, which includes sales to the United States military and foreign military sales financed by the United States government. Tatra will source parts and components through Navistar's global parts and support network for Tatra trucks delivered in markets outside of North America, as well as market Navistar-Tatra vehicles around the world in their primary markets. === Former === ====Ford Motor Company==== 2007 Ford F-650, a product of Blue Diamond Truck From the 1980s to the 2010s, Navistar had a close relationship with Ford Motor Company. Commencing for the 1983 model year as an engine-supply agreement, the relationship evolved into a $400 million yearly business, also involving the production of entire vehicles. Following the end of the diesel- engine supply agreement after the 2010 model year, Ford and Navistar ended collaborative production of medium-duty commercial trucks after the 2014 model year. =====Ford PowerStroke diesel===== As a result of the gas crises of the 1970s, the implementation of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), was applied to light trucks alongside automobiles. In response, large-block gasoline V8 engines (such as the Ford 460) were withdrawn from production from pickup trucks and full-size vans. For the 1983 model year, Ford entered into a supply agreement with International Harvester to use the newly introduced IDI diesel V8 for \u00be and 1-ton F-Series pickups and E-Series vans. While roughly matching the output of the discontinued 400 cubic-inch V8 (the engine that it replaced alongside a reintroduced 460), the 6.9L diesel offered fuel economy closer to the standard 4.9L inline-6. While originally developed for the S1700 medium-duty truck, the engine supply agreement brought a diesel engine to market faster (and at far lower cost) than developing an engine from the ground up. In 1988, as International phased out the 6.9L engine, Ford received the 7.3L IDI diesel. During 1994 production, the IDI was replaced by the all- new T444E; to emphasize the introduction of direct injection fuel delivery, Ford began to brand International-sourced engines under the \"PowerStroke\" branding. As with the IDI, the T444E/PowerStroke was used in F-Series/E-Series trucks and vans. During 2003 production, the Ford Super Duty line and the E-Series adopted the VT365, replacing the T444E. For 2008, the MaxxForce 7 was introduced for the Super Duty pickups as a PowerStroke engine; in place of a variable-geometry turbocharger (used by International trucks), Ford versions of the engine were fitted with compound turbochargers. As the 6.4L engine would not properly fit in the vehicle, the E-Series continued use of the 6.0L diesel. After the 2010 model year, Ford ended the use of International- supplied diesel engines. From 2011 onward, the Super Duty was fitted with diesel engines developed by Ford; the E-Series shifted production exclusively to gasoline-based engines. Today, Ford continues the use of the PowerStroke branding, using it for multiple diesel engines produced by the company. =====Blue Diamond Truck===== 2006 Ford LCF (low-cab forward); built by Blue Diamond Truck (also International CF/CityStar) In September 2001, Navistar announced a joint venture with Ford, named Blue Diamond Truck Co. LLC. A 50/50 agreement between the two companies, Blue Diamond was intended to develop and manufacture vehicles and powertrains for both companies, using the International facility in General Escobedo, Mexico. In 2004, Blue Diamond Truck launched production. While sharing a common frame, the Ford F-650 and F-750 Super Duty were produced with different bodywork and powertrains than the International 4200/4300. In 2006, the two introduced the Ford LCF/International CF, the first model line of the combined company. To create a low-cab COE, the Blue Diamond (Ford/International) frame was combined with the Japanese-sourced cab of the Mazda Titan (converted to left-hand drive). The LCF received the first engine developed by Blue Diamond, a 4.5L V6 (a 6-cylinder version of the 6.0L V8). In 2015, the Blue Diamond Truck venture was dissolved by Ford. While International continued production at General Escobedo, as part of a redesign, Ford commercial truck production was shifted to Avon Lake, Ohio. ====Anhui Jianghuai Navistar==== On 16 September 2010, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. (JAC) announced joint ventures with NC2 Global and Navistar International Corporation that will develop, build, and market heavy duty trucks and diesel engines in China. In May 2018, it was announced that Cummins would be buying out Navistar's equity in the venture. ====Mahindra Navistar==== Navistar formed a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra to build heavy trucks in India under the \"Mahindra International\" brand, which has since been renamed Mahindra Navistar. These trucks were displayed at Auto Expo 2010 in Delhi, India. The joint venture ceased as Navistar exited the joint venture in 2013. ==Controversies== In December 2011, the nonpartisan organization Public Campaign criticized Navistar International for spending $6.31 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008\u20132010, instead getting $18 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $896 million and increasing executive pay by 81%. On January 31, 2005, Navistar Financial said it would restate financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, because it did not take into consideration potential changes to future income. On April 7, 2006, Navistar restated financial results from 2002 through 2004, and for the first three quarters of 2005, due to accounting practices that are the subject of a continuing review. ===Accounting issues=== In January 2006, the company declared it would not file its form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on time. The delay was caused by the disagreement with its auditors, Deloitte & Touche, over complex accounting issues. In April, Navistar fired Deloitte, its independent auditor for 98 years, and hired KPMG to help restate earnings back to 2002 to fix accounting errors. On December 15, 2006, Navistar executives announced a further delay in its restatement and 2006 results. The announcement prompted the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to announce the delisting of the company, after 98 years of trading, although the NYSE subsequently delayed the delisting pending an appeal by Navistar. However, Navistar was removed from the S&P; 500 Index, and the NYSE eventually denied Navistar's appeal and delisted the stock; it traded on the Pink Sheets until 30 June 2008, when it was relisted on the NYSE, under its previous ticker symbol, NAV, after catching up with its filings. Christopher Anderson, the Deloitte partner responsible for the 2003 audit, accepted a one-year suspension from public audits in 2008, and became the first individual to be fined by the PCAOB.Deloitte Partner Disciplined Over Navistar Audit, CNN, October 31, 2008 CEO Daniel Ustian agreed to surrender to Navistar shares worth $1.3 million, while former Chief Financial Officer Robert C. Lannert consented to repay $1.05 million, each sum reflecting monetary bonuses they had received during the restatement period, the SEC said. Four other company executives paid civil penalties without admitting liability. In December 2014, Navistar disclosed more accounting problems. These involved out-of-period adjustments, which were corrections of prior period errors relating to product warranties. This resulted in a $36 million increase in Cost of Products Sold. In addition, a material weakness was disclosed. In the company's annual 10K, they reported that weakness was \"surrounding validation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of significant accounting estimates and accounting transactions. Specifically, controls were not designed to identify errors in the underlying data which was used to calculate warranty cost estimates and other significant accounting estimates and the accounting effects of significant transactions. ===Failed Engine Strategy=== In 2001, then CEO Dan Ustian faced numerous United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines. Despite the change in the compliance arena, the regulations would not begin to be phased in until 2007, with full implementation slated for 2010. Ustian had multiple engineering paths available. Among them were Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers. All required more engineering and development to achieve compliance. Ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid after treatment. As a result, he convinced the company to spend $700 million to fund EGR development. On October 31, 2007, Navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with EGR as the company's strategy. The company statement included Ustian mentioning \u201cI have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers. While SCR is a means to achieve the NOx reduction requirement for 2010, it comes with a steep cost to our customers. Our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for International.\u201d On November 24, 2008, Navistar revealed it would use EPA Credits in order to comply with the 2010 legislation. In February 2009, Ustian touted the benefits of EGR technology as a key differentiator for the company's engines. However, by now, the rest of the industry had chosen to use compliant SCR technology. Ustian disagreed with SCR, saying \"the other thing that EGR avoids is the risks of an SCR strategy. Read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology: \u2018Store between 23 degrees and 68 degrees.\u2019 So essentially it says you can't throw it outside. You can't operate it in conditions above 85 [degrees] or below 12 [degrees]. You can, but, it will put the burden onto the customers.\u201d ====Non-Conformance Penalties==== The EPA recognized Navistar's imminent non-compliance and created a system of Non-Conformance Penalties (NCPs) that included a $1,919 fine for every non-compliant engine that Navistar sold. To bridge the gap, Navistar began using EPA credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines. In August 2012, Navistar stated they would run out of EPA credits soon. Only days earlier the EPA announced increased new penalties of $3,744 per engine. In March 2009, Navistar sued the EPA, claiming that the agency's guidance documents for SCR implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the SCR engine makers. Navistar and the EPA settled the lawsuit a year later. Further masking the EGR problem were high military sales. In the company's 2010 10K report, Navistar cited orders for MRAPs as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession. In January 2012, the EPA adopted an interim final rule that allowed Navistar to continue selling the engines subject to NCPs. Several Navistar competitors sued, and in June 2012 the same appeals court ruled that EPA's interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment. In the meantime, Navistar's EGR decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems. Truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as Navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently. Consequently, they abandoned Navistar trucks in favor of competitor's trucks. ====Legal issues (MaxxForce engines)==== In December 2014, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that 13 of 14 civil lawsuits brought against Navistar for MaxxForce engines would be consolidated into one case. The consolidated lawsuits say Navistar's use of Advanced Exhaust Gas Recirculation emission control system, or EGR, was defective and resulted in repeated engine failures and frequent repairs and downtime. On December 16, 2014, Navistar reported a larger than expected 4th quarter net loss of $72 million. While sales rose 9 percent to $3 billion, the company cited restructuring and warranty costs as the main reasons for the loss. A day earlier, the company announced it would be closing its engine foundry in Indianapolis, resulting in the loss of 100 jobs and costing $11 million. The company estimated annual savings of $13 million in operating costs. In March 2015, Navistar reported a first-quarter 2015 net loss of $42 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to a first-quarter 2014 net loss of $248 million, or $3.05 per diluted share. Revenues in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up to $213 million or 10 percent, versus the first quarter of 2014. The higher revenues in the quarter were driven by a 17 percent year-over-year increase in charge outs for Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada. This included a 42 percent increase in school buses; a 25 percent increase in Class 6/7 medium trucks; a 7 percent increase in Class 8 heavy trucks; and a 5 percent increase in Class 8 severe service trucks. Higher sales in the company's export truck operations also contributed to the increase, partially offset by a decrease in used truck sales. The company finished the first quarter with a 27 percent year-over-year increase in order backlog for Class 6-8 trucks. On June 4, 2015, Navistar reported a second-quarter net loss of $64 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $297 million, or $3.65 a share. Revenue fell to $2.69 billion from $2.75 billion. Analysts had expected a loss of 18 cents a share and revenue of $2.82 billion. On June 9, 2015, Navistar named Jeff Sass as the new Senior VP of North American Truck Sales. Sass previously worked 20 years for rival Paccar. On June 12, 2015, Mark Rachesky's MHR Fund Management LLC disclosed a 6% increased stake in Navistar, up to 15,446,562 shares. The firm now owns 18.9% of Navistar. In July 2015, the EPA filed a civil lawsuit against Navistar seeking $300 million in fines over its use of non-compliant engines in its 2010-model trucks \u2013 engines that did not meet the agency's exhaust emission standards. \u201cBecause (Navistar) completed manufacturing and assembling processes for the subject engines in 2010 \u2026 each and every engine was \u2018produced\u2019 in 2010 and is therefore not a model 2009 engine,\u201d the complaint said. Navistar classified the engines as 2009 model year engines because it began assembling them in 2009. Navistar has stated they dispute the allegations and would \"aggressively defend\" their position. On July 20, 2015, Navistar announced that it was refinancing the $697.5 million senior secured term loan facility of Navistar, Inc., which matures in August 2017, with a new $1.040 billion senior secured term loan, which will mature in August 2020. The refinancing will extend the maturity of the term loan facility and provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility for the company. In March 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Navistar with misleading investors about its development of the advanced technology truck engine. In August 2017, a Tennessee jury found that Navistar committed fraud and violated the Tennessee Consumer Practice Act in connection with the sale of 243 Navistar International ProStars with MaxxForce engines to Milan Supply Chain Solutions. It awarded $10.8 million in actual damages and $20 million in punitive damages. The trial included testimony from Jim Hebe, who previously was the senior vice president, North America Sales Operations. Hebe retired in October 2012. Hebe's testimony about the engine program mentioned that the company \"did not test shit\". In a statement, Navistar said it is disappointed in the jury's verdict and is evaluating its options to challenge it, noting it has successfully defended similar claims in several jurisdictions, including dismissal of claims of fraud in courts in Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Alabama, and Illinois. ==Images== ==See also== * International Harvester * List of International (brand) trucks * List of International Harvester vehicles * Odyne Corporation * Traton Group * Volkswagen Group ==References== ==External links== * * International Trucks * Category:Defense companies of the United States Category:Holding companies of the United States Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers based in Illinois Category:Military vehicle manufacturers Category:Diesel engine manufacturers Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1986 Category:Holding companies established in 1986 Category:Companies based in DuPage County, Illinois Category:Lisle, Illinois Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Announced mergers and acquisitions ",
