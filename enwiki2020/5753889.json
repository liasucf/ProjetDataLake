    "text": "The 1984 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1983\u201384 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Larry Bird was named NBA Finals MVP. This was the first postseason allowing 16 teams to qualify, a format still in use. The first round format was also changed from best-of-3 to best-of 5. It was the first NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Lakers since 1969; they met 7 times in the Finals from 1959\u201369, with Boston coming out on top each year. Going into the 1984 playoffs, the Lakers had already won 2 titles in the 1980s and the Celtics 1, making the revival of the Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry arguably inevitable and certainly highly anticipated. Two teams made their playoff debuts and won their first playoff series: the Utah Jazz (who joined the NBA for the 1974\u201375 season as the New Orleans Jazz) and Dallas Mavericks, a 1981 expansion team. The Jazz did not miss the playoffs again until 2004. The Detroit Pistons made the playoffs for the first time since 1977, starting a string of nine consecutive appearances that included five straight Conference Finals appearances (1987-1991), three consecutive NBA Finals appearances (1988, 1989, and 1990) and two NBA Championships. They did not miss the playoffs again until 1993. The New Jersey Nets won a playoff series for the first time in their NBA history, upsetting the defending champion Philadelphia 76ers in 5. This was also the only time the road team won every game in a five-game playoff series. The Nets would not win a playoff series again until 2002. This was the final postseason appearance for the Kansas City Kings, as the team moved to Sacramento, California two seasons later. Kemper Arena hosted its final NBA playoff game. The Kingdome also hosted its final NBA playoff game, as the Seattle SuperSonics moved back full-time to the Seattle Center Coliseum two years later. However, the Kingdome continued to host Sonics regular season games on occasion until . The 1984 playoffs also involved two of the hottest games in NBA history. Game 5 of the First Round between the Knicks and Pistons was played at Joe Louis Arena, as the Pontiac Silverdome was unavailable, with temperatures reaching as high as 120\u00b0. Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Lakers at Boston Garden reached temperatures as high as 100\u00b0, as the Garden lacked air-conditioning, coupled with the sweltering outdoors conditions in Boston. ==Bracket== ==Western Conference== Champion: Los Angeles Lakers ===1st Round=== (1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Kansas City Kings: Lakers win series 3-0 *Game 1 @ The Forum, Los Angeles (April 18): Los Angeles 116, Kansas City 105 *Game 2 @ The Forum, Los Angeles (April 20): Los Angeles 109, Kansas City 102 *Game 3 @ Kemper Arena, Kansas City (April 22): Los Angeles 108, Kansas City 102 {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Regular-season series |- !Los Angeles won 5\u20130 in the regular-season series |- | |} This was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first six meetings.
