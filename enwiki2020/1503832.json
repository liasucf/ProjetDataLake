    "text": "Louise-Victorine Ackermann Louise-Victorine Ackermann (n\u00e9e Choquet) (30 November 1813 \u2013 2 August 1890) was a French Parnassian poet. ==Life== Ackermann was born in Paris, but spent her younger days in more rural surroundings near Montdidier, south-east of Amiens. In 1829, her father, having undertaken her early education, in the philosophy of the Encyclopaedists, sent her to school in Paris. In 1838, Victorine Choquet went to Berlin to study German, and there married Paul Ackermann, an Alsatian philologist, in 1843. After little more than two years of happy married life her husband died, and Madame Ackermann went to live in Nice with a favorite sister. In 1855, she published Contes en vers, and in 1862, Contes et po\u00e9sies. Very different from these simple and charming contes is the work on which Madame Ackermann's real reputation rests. She published in 1874 Po\u00e9sies, premi\u00e8res po\u00e9sies, po\u00e9sies philosophiques, a volume of sombre and powerful verse, expressing her revolt against human suffering. The volume was enthusiastically reviewed in the Revue des deux mondes for May 1871 by Elme Marie Caro, who, though he deprecated the impi\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e of the verses, did full justice to their vigour and the excellence of their form. Soon after the publication of this volume Madame Ackermann moved back to Paris, where she gathered round her a circle of friends, but published nothing further except a prose volume, the Pens\u00e9es d'un solitaire (\"Thoughts of a Recluse\", 1883), to which she prefixed a short autobiography. She died at Nice on 2 August 1890. ==Published works== Louise Ackermann's published works as cited by An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers. *Contes et Po\u00e9sues, 1862. *Le Deluge, 1876. *Pens\u00e9es d'une Solitaire, Prec\u00e9d\u00e9es d'une Autobiographie, 1882. *Oeuvres, 1885. *Ma Vie, 1885. *Premi\u00e9re Po\u00e9sies, 1885. *Po\u00e9sies Philosophiques, 1885. *Contes, 1955. *Po\u00e9sies Philosophiques, 1971. ==References== Category:1813 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Writers from Paris Category:19th-century French poets Category:French women poets Category:19th-century French women writers ",
