Its remaining product line is now part of Oracle Corporation, and marketed as Oracle StorageTek, with a focus on tape backup equipment and software to manage storage systems. ==History == In 1969 four former IBM engineers\u2014Jesse Aweida, Juan Rodriguez, Thomas S. Kavanagh, and Zoltan Herger\u2014founded the Storage Technology Corporation. The headquarters was in Louisville, Boulder County, Colorado. In the 1970s, StorageTek launched its Disk Products division. After a failed attempt to develop an IBM-compatible mainframe, and an optical disk product line, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1984. Starting in 1987, new management invested in an automated tape library product line that \"picked\" tapes from a silo-like contraption with a robot arm. StorageTek emerged as a dominant player in that market. StorageTek acquired Documation (1980), Aspen Peripherals Corporation (1989), Network Systems Corporation (1995), and Storability (2005). Storage Technology Corporation was officially renamed \"StorageTek\" in 1983.
