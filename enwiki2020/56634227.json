    "text": "Cameron Kasky (born November 11, 2000) is an American activist and advocate against gun violence who co-founded the student-led gun violence prevention advocacy group Never Again MSD. He is notable for helping to organize the March for Our Lives nationwide student protest in March 2018. Kasky is a survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Kasky was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. == Early life and education == Kasky was a student, a \"theatre kid\", and former member of the drama club at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) in Parkland, Florida, and was a junior at the time of the school shooting in February 2018. He has a younger brother with autism who is also a survivor of the MSD shooting. He currently attends Columbia University.Jon Levine, August 31, 2019, New York Post, Parkland shooting survivor Cameron Kasky is \u2018excited\u2019 to be going to Columbia University, Retrieved September 7, 2019 == Advocacy == Kasky had just left drama class when the shooting began at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018. After meeting his younger brother at a different classroom and exiting the school, the fire alarm sounded. With other students, they were instructed to go back inside. They waited an hour in a classroom until they were rescued. After the shooting, Kasky brought several school friends to his house and with them founded Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain), a student-led gun control advocacy group. Kasky came up with the name \"Never Again\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\" to Facebook. The group works to create a national movement against gun violence, including an effort to publicize legislators receiving money from the NRA and persuading people not to vote for them. It promoted and led a massive rally called March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, on March 24, 2018. According to a report in The New Yorker, it was Kasky's idea to found the activist group along with fellow students David Hogg, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, Sarah Chadwick and others \u2013 a group described by reporter Michael Schulman as having \"moral clarity and vision\" in the gun control debate. Kasky wrote an op-ed on the CNN website describing the events of the massacre and his reaction to it. In an interview, Kasky told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that \"my generation won't stand for this.\" Although known as a \"theatre kid\" with a reputation for being the class clown, Kasky's experience after the shooting was primarily one of anger: At a televised \"Stand Up\" town hall session sponsored by CNN with Senator Marco Rubio, Kasky asked the senator whether he would continue receiving money from the National Rifle Association (NRA): \"Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?\" Rubio responded by saying, \"I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.\" Kasky repeatedly questioned Rubio about whether he would continue receiving NRA money. The senator did not offer a definitive response but appeared to soften his positions regarding some gun restrictions. Kasky temporarily stopped utilizing Facebook as a result of death threats. When later Kasky was accused of being a crisis actor, he replied to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that \"if you had seen me in our school's production of 'Fiddler on the Roof,' you would know that nobody would pay me to act for anything.\" Kasky announced the March for Our Lives rally on February 18, 2018. Later that week, Kasky appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Emma Gonz\u00e1lez and Jaclyn Corin to discuss their advocacy and march. Kasky said, \"The thing that inspired us to create the march was people saying, 'This is not the time to talk about gun control, this is the time to mourn.' We understand that, so here's the time to talk about gun control. March 24th.\" In March 2018, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with fellow activists Jaclyn Corin, Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, and Alex Wind.Associated Press, March 22, 2018, Houston Public Media, \"Parkland Students On Cover Of Time Magazine\" , Retrieved March 22, 2018, Note: cover third week March 2018; \"...The cover features Marjory Stoneman Douglas students Jaclyn Corin, Alex Wind, Emma Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky and David Hogg,...\" Kasky called President Donald Trump a \"professional liar\" on CNN after Trump delivered a pro-gun speech at the annual NRA convention in Dallas in May 2018, in contrast to Trump's prior call for gun control reform in the wake of the Parkland shooting. Kasky criticized the president to point out Trump said what he needed to say to appease the NRA.CNN, Veronica Stracqualursi, May 5, 2018, Parkland student Cameron Kasky calls Trump a 'professional liar' after NRA speech , Retrieved May 6, 2018Avery Anapol, May 5, 2018, The Hill, Parkland student rips Trump over NRA speech: 'He's a professional liar' , Retrieved May 8, 2018, \"...slammed President Trump for speaking at the National Rifle Association (NRA) Leadership Forum the previous day by calling him a \"professional liar...\" In May 2018, Kasky's father registered a super PAC, Families vs Assault Rifles PAC (FAMSVARPAC), with intentions of going \"up against NRA candidates in every meaningful race in the country\". ===New laws=== In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocates around $400 million. The governor signed the bill into law on March 9. He commented, \"To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change.\" === Departure from March for Our Lives === On September 19, 2018, Kasky announced his decision to leave March for Our Lives in an interview with Fox News Radio. He expressed regret for some of his past actions, including confronting Rubio at the \"Stand Up\" town hall session and saying the name of the Parkland shooter aloud in his question to Rubio. However, Kasky said his decision to leave March for Our Lives was not due to a change of heart or political views. Instead, he wants to take responsibility for his actions and encourages others to seek mental health services when necessary. Moving past March for Our Lives, Kasky is working on improving himself personally and a new podcast, \"Cameron Knows Nothing\". ===Reactions=== In The New Yorker, journalist Evan Osnos singled out Kasky's direct questioning of Marco Rubio at the CNN town hall as significant and as something no journalist had ever been able to do. People magazine stated that as founder of the #NeverAgain movement, and despite death threats from NRA supporters, \"Kasky has committed himself to advancing legislative changes that will make it more difficult for people to get guns, and in the process, has helped inspire advocacy around the cause\". ==Politics== Kasky endorsed Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, claiming to be \"very tired of... the same nonsense that\u2019s been failing the American people for generations. Yang is offering up solutions that change the game.\" Upon Yang dropping out, Kasky threw his support behind Bernie Sanders, and subsequently endorsed Joe Biden in the general election. == Selected works == * ==References== ==External links== * * * * Survivor to Rubio: Will you reject NRA money?
