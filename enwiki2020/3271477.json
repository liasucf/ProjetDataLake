    "text": "In association football, the back-pass rule prohibits the goalkeeper from handling the ball in most cases when it is passed to them by a team-mate. It is described in Law 12, Section 2 of the Laws of the Game. ==Award== Goalkeepers are normally allowed to handle the ball within their own penalty area, and once they have control of the ball in their hands opposition players may not challenge them for it. However the back-pass rule prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a team-mate, or after receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate. Back-passes with parts of the body other than the foot, such as headers, are allowed. Despite the popular name \"back-pass rule\", there is no requirement in the laws that the kick or throw-in must be backwards; handling by the goalkeeper is forbidden regardless of the direction the ball travels. The penalty for the offence is an indirect free kick. This is awarded from the position where the handling occurred, unless it is within the 6-yard goal area, in which the kick is taken from the point on the 6-yard line closest to the point of the offence. ===Tricks to circumvent the rule=== Goalkeepers are allowed to handle the ball if the ball is played back to them by an action other than a kick or throw-in (such as a header), but defenders are not permitted to attempt to use a deliberate trick to pass the ball to the goalkeeper with a part of the body other than the foot to circumvent the rule. This would include flicking the ball up with the foot and then heading the ball back to the goalkeeper, or heading a ball on the ground that would otherwise be regularly playable with the foot. If a player uses such a trick, they are cautioned for unsporting behaviour, and the opponents are awarded an indirect free kick from where the trick was performed. It is irrelevant as to whether the goalkeeper subsequently handles the ball or not. ===Interpretation=== The United States Soccer Federation (USSF) has provided the following guidance on how this offence should be judged by referees: ==History and impact== The back-pass rule was introduced in 1992ifab.com \u2013 The History of the Laws of the Game \u2013 From 1863 to the Present Day \u2013 accessed 5 November 2017 to discourage time-wasting and unduly defensive play after the 1990 World Cup was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding up the ball. The incident cited as causing the rule change was in the Republic of Ireland vs Egypt game, where Ireland goalkeeper Packie Bonner dribbled the ball around his area and continually picked it back up, for a total of 6 minutes. The first games played with the new rule were at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Early matches with the new rule resulted in some confusion in defences; indeed in the very first game Italy fell foul of the new rule and USA were able to score after being awarded an indirect free kick 15 yards from goal. In 1997, the back-pass rule was extended to prevent goalkeepers handling the ball when received directly from a team-mate's throw in. A goal scored by FC Bayern Munich from an indirect free kick, awarded for a back-pass late in a game between them and Hamburger SV, was decisive in Bayern winning the 2000\u201301 Bundesliga. The back pass rule is considered one of the most popular and successful rule changes in the modern game. As well as preventing dull play, it also required goalkeepers to become more proficient with playing the ball with the foot, and has been cited as the start of the evolution of the play-making \"sweeper-keeper\". ==References== Category:Laws of association football Category:Association football terminology Category:1992 in association football ",
