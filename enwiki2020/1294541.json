    "text": "Terry Lester (April 13, 1950 \u2013 November 28, 2003) was an American actor. His best known roles include Jack Abbott on The Young and the Restless, Mason Capwell on Santa Barbara and Royce Keller on As the World Turns. == Early life and education == Lester was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated from Southport High School and began an acting career while at DePauw University. == Career == He starred in the 1976 children's series Ark II, followed by roles in Airport 1975 and the 1978 Kiss movie Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park. Lester's big break came when he joined CBS daytime soap The Young and the Restless in 1980. He originated the role of Jack Abbott, a scoundrel who never met a woman (including his own father's wife) he didn't want to take to bed. Lester was so popular that The Young and the Restless creator William J. Bell wrote an entire family for him. The series was going through a transition period which many fans believed his star quality helped the show build more viewership rising to #1 in daytime soap ratings. In spite of his popularity, by the end of the decade Lester felt his role on the show was steadily declining. In 1989 he not only quit but took the rare step of going to the daytime press and singling out Bill Bell's young daughter, Lauralee Bell (who plays ingenue Christine Blair), for his dwindling role. He felt the excess airtime given to her came at the expense of both himself and other actors. Lester was replaced by Peter Bergman, who has played the part of Jack ever since. Lester switched to NBC to take over the role of Mason Capwell on Santa Barbara for a year. In November 1992, he joined As the World Turns to play the charming Royce Keller, who was soon revealed to be suffering from multiple personalities which caused him to kill his own sister in the series. The role was complex, causing raves for Lester, but the headwriter behind the story, Douglas Marland, died suddenly in 1993, and Lester once again found his screentime diminishing. He left the series on May 5, 1994. The remainder of his professional life consisted of appearances in primetime shows such as Walker, Texas Ranger and Star Trek: Voyager along with various tours in musicals and plays. == Death == On November 28, 2003, Lester died of a heart attack at the age of 53. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ Roles in television and film |- ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Role ! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 1975 || Airport 1975 || Mr. Kelly || Film; uncredited |- | 1975 || Barbary Coast || Bret Hollister || Episode: \"The Barbary Coast\" |- | 1976 || Ark II || Jonah || Main role |- | 1978 || Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park || Sam || Television film |- | 1978 || Flying High || Billy Bob || Episode: \"Swan Song for an Ugly Duckling\" |- | 1979 || Eight Is Enough || Reed Ellis || Episode: \"The Cupid Crisis\" |- | 1979 || Dallas || Rudy Millington || Episode: \"Return Engagement\" |- | 1980 || Once Upon a Spy || Rudy || Television film |- | 1980\u20131989 || The Young and the Restless || Jack Abbott || Regular role |- | 1985 || Blade in Hong Kong || Joe Blade || Television film |- | 1985 || Hotel || Chad Wheeler || Episode: \"Echoes\" |- | 1987 || In Self Defense || Dan Edwards || Television film |- | 1989\u20131990 || Santa Barbara || Mason Capwell || Regular role |- | 1991\u20131994 || As The World Turns || Royce Keller || Recurring role |- | 1995 || Star Trek: Voyager || Haron || Episode: \"Maneuvers\" |- | 1997 || JAG || Chief Petty Officer Fred Holst || Episode: \"Rendezvous\" |- | 1997 || Diagnosis: Murder || Jeffrey Porter || Episode: \"Open and Shut\" |- | 1999 || Walker, Texas Ranger || Earl McMartin || Episode: \"Power Angels\" |- |} == References == == External links == * * * Category:1950 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American male soap opera actors Category:Place of death missing Category:American male television actors Category:DePauw University alumni Category:Gay actors Category:Male actors from Indianapolis Category:LGBT entertainers from the United States Category:20th-century American male actors ",
