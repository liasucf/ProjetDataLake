    "text": "The Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum is an automobile museum located in Auburn, Indiana in the United States. It is dedicated to preserving cars built by Auburn Automobile, Cord Automobile, and Duesenberg Motors Company. ==History== The Auburn Automobile Company administration building is part of the campus where cars were hand-assembled, rather than mass-produced. The showroom and administrative buildings were designed by architect Alvin M. Strauss in Art Deco style and were built in 1930. The facility's showroom and administrative buildings, the service and new parts building, and the L-29 building were together declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005. ==Exhibits and collections== The museum is organized into seven galleries that display over 120 cars and related exhibits such as restored Auburn Automobile company offices. Some exhibits have interactive kiosks that allow a visitor to hear the sounds the car makes and to see related videos and photographs that show the engineering that went into its design. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Automobile museums in Indiana Category:Auburn, Indiana Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:National Historic Landmarks in Indiana Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1930 Category:Museums in DeKalb County, Indiana Category:Art Deco architecture in Indiana Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in DeKalb County, Indiana Category:1930 establishments in Indiana Category:Motor vehicle manufacturing plants on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Transportation on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Auto dealerships of the United States ",
