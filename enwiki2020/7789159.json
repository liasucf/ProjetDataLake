    "text": "Portastatic is an American indie rock band founded in the early 1990s by Mac McCaughan. Portastatic began as a solo project for McCaughan, lead singer and guitarist of the indie rock band Superchunk. Since then it has evolved into a full-fledged band, which sometimes includes Superchunk guitarist Jim Wilbur and McCaughan's brother Matthew. Tom Scharpling of 18 Wheeler fanzine (and later a popular DJ on WFMU) was so impressed by McCaughan's solo material that he cajoled him into releasing it under the fanzine's own imprint; so came 1993's \"Starter\" 7\". Since then, under the Portastatic moniker, McCaughan has recorded several records drawing on a number of genres, including traditional indie rock, lo-fi, soundtrack and Brazilian music. The name \"Portastatic\" is derived from the TASCAM Portastudio home recording device.Parker, Chris (2008-09-10). \"Mac McCaughan: Through with Portastatic?\" Indyweek.com. Due to the quality of the recordings, Mac McCaughan added \"static\" to \"porta\" to form \"Portastatic.\" ==Discography== ===Official Albums=== 1994 - I Hope Your Heart Is Not Brittle (CD/LP) [Merge] 1995 - Slow Note From a Sinking Ship (CD/LP) [Merge] 1997 - The Nature of Sap (CD/LP) [Merge] 2003 - Summer of the Shark (CD) [Merge] 2005 - Bright Ideas (CD) [Merge] 2006 - Be Still Please (CD) [Merge] ===Compilation Albums=== 2008 - Some Small History (CD) [Merge] ===Demo Albums=== 2005 - Ideas for Bright Ideas (CD) [The Portastatic Label] 2006 - Some Small Things You Can't Defend (CD) [The Portastatic Label] ===Soundtracks=== 2001 - Looking For Leonard (CD) [Merge] 2006 - Who Loves the Sun (CD) [Merge] ===Singles and EP'S=== 1993 - Starter (7\") [18 Wheeler] 1994 - Naked Pilseners (7\"/CD EP) [Matador] 1994 - Hello CD of the Month (CD EP) [Hello] 1994 - San Andreas Couch (7\") [Ester] 1995 - Scrapbook X's (7\") [18 Wheeler] 1995 - Scrapbook EP (Double 7\"/CD EP) [Merge] 1996 - Spying On The Spys (7\") [Merge] 1997 - Trash Heap - Split 7\" w/ Ida (Split 7\") [Trash Heap] 1997 - Portastatic/The Landing Split 7\" (Split 7\") [Sarang Bang]: \"Secret Session\"/\"And Forward Again\" 1997 - Portastatic/The Ladybug Transistor/Land of the Loops Split 7\" (Split 7\") [After Hours]: \"You Love To Fail\" 2000 - De Mel, De Mel\u00e3o (CD EP) [Merge] 2001 - The Perfect Little Door (Featuring Ken Vandermark)(CD EP) [Merge] 2003 - Autumn Was a Lark (CD EP) [Merge] 2005 - Looking For A Power Supply (CD EP) [Houston Party] 2005 - I Wanna Know Girls (Digital EP) [iTunes/Merge] 2006 - Sour Shores (Digital EP) [Merge] 2009 - Make It Sound In Tune (Digital EP) [Merge] ===Compilation Appearances=== 1994 - Ow!, Quit It!
