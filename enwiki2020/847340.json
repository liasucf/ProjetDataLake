    "text": "Bl\u00e0 Bheinn (also known as Blaven), is a mountain on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is usually regarded as an outlier to the Black Cuillin. It is mainly composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineers and scramblers. The name is thought to mean \"blue mountain\", from a combination of Norse and Gaelic. Whereas in Modern Norwegian means \"blue\", the Old Norse word could, however, also refer to the colours blue-black and black. The normal route of ascent for walkers is from the east. A path leaves the B8083 on the shores of Loch Slapin about 4 km after the village of Torrin. The path follows a burn, the Allt na Dunachie, into the corrie of Coire Uaigneich. From here a short steep route along the ridge leads to the summit. A small amount of scrambling is needed to reach the true top of the mountain. Alternative routes follow the south ridge, or come from the north having traversed the Clach Glas ridge which links to the Red Cuillin peaks. The view from the summit is dominated by the Black Cuillin. Blaven stands in the Strathaird Estate, owned and managed since 1994 by the John Muir Trust. == In popular culture == Blaven is depicted in Mary Stewart's 1956 thriller novel Wildfire at Midnight. ==References== ==External links== * Blaven.com * John Muir Trust Category:Munros Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of Highland (council area) Category:Mountains and hills of the Isle of Skye ",
