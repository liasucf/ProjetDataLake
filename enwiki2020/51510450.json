Their debut studio album Tell Me It's Real peaked at No. 59 on the UK Albums Chart. ==Career== The duo formed in 2011 after Jack Sedman and Harry Draper met at an open mic night near their hometown of Bridlington. They were impressed with each other's performances, and quickly decided to work together as musicians. They lived close to the coast, and the name of the band referenced both the mist that rolls in from the North Sea during the summer, and a pun on a guitar fretboard.
