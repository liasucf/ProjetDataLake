When PolyGram merged with Universal, the imprint was deactivated and its roster was transferred to GRP. In 2004, Verve Forecast was revived again to replace Blue Thumb to handle acts outside of jazz. ==Roster== Verve Forecast signed pop, rock, folk, and blues musicians such as The Blues Project, Caravan, James Cotton, Friend & Lover, Tim Hardin, Richie Havens, The Hombres, John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Janis Ian, Jim and Jean, Lead Belly, Bob Lind, The New Lost City Ramblers, Laura Nyro, Odetta, Street, and Dave Van Ronk.
