The Budovar is a system of natural and channeled water flow of Patka-Budovar. It originates from the eastern slopes of the Fru\u0161ka Gora mountain, near the village of \u010cortanovci as the Patka (Cyrillic: \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430) at an altitude of 215 m. The river flows to the southeast, through the village of Be\u0161ka, where it is crossed by the Belgrade-Novi Sad highway. After it receives the smaller stream from the left near the village of Kr\u010dedin, the river is known as the Budovar. The river turns south and flows parallel to the highway, next to the village of Novi Karlovci, before it empties into the Danube at the village of Stari Banovci. The Budovar belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable. Category:Rivers of Serbia Category:Geography of Vojvodina Category:Syrmia ",
