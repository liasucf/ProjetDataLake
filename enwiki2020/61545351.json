The mother moved the family to Store K\u00f8bmagergade in 1858. He left the company in 1862 and started to take lessons in Latin and Herman with the ambition of later studying law. At the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War in 1974, he immediately enrolled as a volunteer and was severely wounded in the Battle of Lundby on 3 July. After the war he returned to his uncle's company where he worked as a traveling salesman in the provinces. In 1866 he pursued an old dream by moving to England but had difficulties finding work in both Hull. Manchester and London. He did eventually manage to get work as a salesman for a spinning mill and a rubber factory but returned to Copenhagen in January 1867. ==Career== In September 1868, Petersen was granted licensed as a merchant in Copenhagen and established a trading house under his own name in Nygade. It traded in a wide range of products with the textile in industry. The company moved to new premises on K\u00f8bmagergade in 1868 and relocated to the old vajsenhus Building on the same street (No. 44) in 1875. His company purchased the entire complex in 1888. It was subsequently adapted and expanded several times, most notably in 1889-90 and 1906-07. Holger Petersen's Textile Factory on Tagensvej In 1878, Petersen and his brother John established a textile factory in Store Kongensgade. The factory relocated to larger premises on Tagensvej in 1883. The Tagensvej factory was later expanded several times. The activities comprised woolen textiles, ribbons and buttons. The factory was established as a separate company but was after Holger Petersen's death, om 1917, acquired by his trading house. The company established a subsidiary in Stockholm in 1889 and opened a factory in Malm\u00f6 in 1893. The Ma\u00e6m\u00f3 factory was in 1994 turned into a separate company under the name Fabriksaktiebolaget Skandinavien. ==Other activities== ===Politics and organisations=== Petersen represented H\u00f8jre in Landstinget from 1909 and was a member of the Defence Commission of 1902. He was a co-founder of Foreningen af danske manufaktur-grossister and was for many years president of the organisation. He was in 1904-17 a member of Grosserer-Societetet's committee. ===Danish interests in North Schleswig=== Petersen was from 1889 strongly involved for promotion of Danish culture in S\u00f8nderjylland, collaborating with H.P. Hanssen and members of Rradikale Studentersamfundsm\u00e6nd such as H.V. Clausen and Niels Hjort. He contributed actively to realizing Clausen's Association of 5 Octoberm a secret credit institution which contributed to keeping North Schlesvig land on Danish hands against the explicit policy of the Prussian government. ===Danish West Indies=== Petersen was also involved in the efforts to revive the economy of the Danish West Indies but with little success.

He visited the islands again in 1905 and again in 1910-11 to inspect the results of the new initiatives. In 1909, Holger Petersen provided most of the necessary capital when A/S Vestindisk sukkerfabrik acquired Jacob Lachmann's sugar refinery on Saint Croix and was himself appointed as chairman of the board. Petersen began to sell his activities in the Danish West Indies when the discussion about a possible sale of the islands to the US was revived and it became obvious that a sale was unavoidable ===Jutland=== Petersen was a co-founder of Plantningsselskabet Staushede in 1880. In 1891, he planted the more than 500 ha large Baldersb\u00e6k plantation. In 1895, Petersen purchased H\u00f8lund in a partnership with Christian Dalgas.
