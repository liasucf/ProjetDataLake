He set up an armed group that was active until 1906 in the area of Sintiki, Serres and Petrich. From 1906 to 1907, he cooperated with the bodies of Doukas Gaitatzis and Stergios Vlachveis as the leader of his own group. He took part in many operations against Bulgarian groups operating in the region. After 1908 he was placed as a teacher at the Greek School of Starchevo, having as mission the information about the movements of the Bulgarians in the region. He was often imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities for his actions. With the outbreak of the First Balkan War, he rushed to be a volunteer. == Sources & References == * \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u0391\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u0398\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd (\u0394\u0395\u03a0\u0391\u0398\u0391), \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1, \u03c6. \u0393-241 * John S.
