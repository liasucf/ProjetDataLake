    "text": "The 1890 FA Cup Final was contested by Blackburn Rovers and The Wednesday at the Kennington Oval. Blackburn won 6\u20131, with goals from William Townley (3), Nat Walton, Jack Southworth and Joe Lofthouse. The Wednesday's goal was scored by Albert Mumford. Townley's hat-trick was the first in an FA Cup Final. Haydn Arthur Morley, who was Wednesday's captain in the final, earned his living as a solicitor. This was the last of seven consecutive and eight total finals that had been officiated by Major Francis Marindin of the Royal Engineers and veteran of the Crimean War. The match set the record for the highest scoring FA Cup Final, later equalled by the 1953 final. ==Match== ===Details=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | || ||Johnny Horne |- | || ||James Southworth |- | || ||John Forbes |- | || ||John Barton |- | || ||Geordie Dewar |- | || ||Jimmy Forrest |- | || ||Joe Lofthouse |- | || ||Harry Campbell |- | || ||Jack Southworth |- | ||||Nat Walton |- | ||||William Townley |- |colspan=4| |- |colspan=\"4\"| |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | ||||Jim Smith |- | ||||Haydn Morley (Captain) |- | ||||Teddy Brayshaw |- | ||||Jack Dungworth |- | ||||Billy Betts |- | ||||George Waller |- | ||||Billy Ingram |- | ||||Harry Woolhouse |- | ||||Michael Bennett |- | ||||Albert Mumford |- | ||||Tom Cawley |- |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| |} *Played 29 March 1890 *Attendance: 20,000 *Referee: Major Francis Marindin ==References== ==External links== *1889\u201390 Competition Results at rsssf.com *FA Cup Final lineups *Soccerbase summary *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk 1890 Final Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. matches Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. matches Category:March 1890 sports events ",
