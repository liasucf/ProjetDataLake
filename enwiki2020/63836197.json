    "text": "The 2020 USR-PLUS Alliance () is an electoral alliance established on 2 February 2019 between the political parties Save Romania Union (USR) and the Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party (PLUS) to participate together in the 2019 European Parliament election in Romania of May. Subsequently, the two parties decided to sign a protocol for a political alliance for the 2019 Romanian presidential election of November as well. ==History== Dan Barna (USR) and Dacian Ciolo\u0219 (PLUS), as leaders of the alliance, declared on 2 February 2019 that the two parties reached an agreement to participate jointly in European elections and that the project was a first step towards a possible success in the next Romanian legislative election. On 7 March 2019, the Central Electoral Bureau (BEC) rejected the application for registration of the 2020 USR-PLUS Alliance for the European Parliament elections, motivating that Barna and Ciolo\u0219 were not listed as presidents of the two parties in the Register of Political Parties. Barna was elected president of the USR in October 2017, and Ciolo\u0219 was elected president of the PLUS in February 2019. Both requested their registration as presidents at the Bucharest Tribunal, but until the Alliance's registration they did not receive a final decision. Deputy Nicu\u0219or Dan, former president of the USR, declared that \"I found, together with the legal team, the solution that would allow me to legally countersign the protocol of the USR-PLUS Alliance\". On March 8, the High Court of Cassation and Justice accepted USR-PLUS' appeal to the decision of the BEC to not to allow the alliance to be registered. The alliance's chosen slogan is F\u0103r\u0103 ho\u021bie ajungem departe, meaning \"Without stealing we get far\" and referring to the existing corruption in Romania. ==2019 European Parliament elections== Members of the 2020 USR-PLUS Alliance thanking the people of Bucharest for the victory in the European Parliament elections of May 2019 On 4 April 2019, the 2020 USR-PLUS Alliance presented, during a press conference, its party platform for the European Parliament elections. The alliance's electoral offer covers four main subjects: \"Justice and protection of the rights of the Romanians in the European Union\", \"welfare for society: health, education and anti-poverty measures\", \"European prosperity at home, in Romania\", and \"foreign and secure policy\". Among the promises of the alliance are the creation of an applicable European Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification, Romania's accession to the Schengen Area and changes in education, agriculture and infrastructure. The alliance also supports the Accession of Moldova to the European Union. On the occasion of the European Council meeting of May 9 in Sibiu, Romania, Ciolos had a meeting with Emmanuel Macron, President of France, focused on a discussion on the creation of a new political group in the European Parliament after the elections of May 26. During the political campaign, the alliance organized two major party rallies attended by both leaders of the alliance, one on May 5 in Cluj-Napoca and the other one on May 12 in Timi\u0219oara. The Bucharest rally of 24 May was also attended by Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament, who announced the formation of a new Pro-European reformist center parliamentary group, together with the La R\u00e9publique En Marche! of Emmanuel Macron. ==Electoral history== ===Legislative elections=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election ! colspan=\"3\" |Chamber ! colspan=\"3\" |Senate ! rowspan=\"2\" |Position ! rowspan=\"2\" |Aftermath |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- !rowspan=3| 2020 |TBD |TBD | |TBD |TBD | |TBD | |} === Local elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Election ! colspan=\"3\"| County Councilors (CJ) ! colspan=\"3\"| Mayors ! colspan=\"3\"| Local Councilors (CL) ! rowspan=\"2\"| Popular vote ! rowspan=\"2\"| % ! rowspan=\"2\"| Position |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- !2020 |478,659 |6.65 | |490,362 |6.58 | |504,563 |6.85 | |696.478 |8.89 !style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- |} ===Presidential elections=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Election ! rowspan=2 | Candidate ! colspan=2 | First round ! colspan=2 | Second round ! rowspan=2 | Result |- !
