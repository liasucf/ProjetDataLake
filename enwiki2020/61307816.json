    "text": "Eucalyptus globulus subsp. globulus, commonly known as the Tasmanian blue gum, southern blue gum, or blue gum, is a subspecies of tree that is endemic to southeastern Australia. It has mostly smooth bark with some persistent slabs of old bark at the base, juvenile leaves with one glaucous side, glossy, lance-shaped adult leaves, warty flower buds arranged singly in leaf axils, white flowers and hemispherical to conical fruit that is more or less square in cross-section.flower buds and flowerfruit ==Description== Eucalyptus globulus subsp. globulus is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is mostly smooth, shedding in long strips to leave a white or greyish surface. There is sometimes rough, partially shed bark at the base of the trunk and ribbons of shedding bark in the upper branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, with a prominent wing on each corner. The juvenile leaves are sessile, arranged in opposite pairs, elliptic to egg-shaped, the lower surface covered by a white, waxy bloom, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a thick peduncle that is sessile or up to long. Mature buds are glaucous, conical and warty, long and wide with four ribs along the sides and a flattened operculum that has a central knob. Flowering occurs between May and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, sessile, hemispherical to conical capsule, square in cross-section, long and wide with four longitudinal ridges and the valves at about rim level. ==Taxonomy and naming== Tasmanian blue gum was first formally described in 1800 by Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re in his book, Relation du Voyage \u00e0 la Recherche de la P\u00e9rouse. In 1974, James Barrie Kirkpatrick described four subspecies of E. globulus and E. globulus subsp. globulus became the autonym. ==Distribution and habitat== This blue gum grows in woodland and forest in moist valleys in Victoria and Tasmania, including on Flinders and King Islands. It is common in lowland areas of Tasmania but is only found in the far south of Victoria, including in places like Port Franklin and Wilsons Promontory. == References == globulus Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1800 Category:Taxa named by Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re ",
