Islam: An Introduction (Translation of: Der Islam). SUNY Press. . . p. 86 His book, Kitab al\u2013Milal wa al-Nihal (lit. The Book of Sects and Creeds) was one of the pioneers in developing an objective and philosophical approach to the study of religions. ==Life== Very few things are known about al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b's life. He was born in 1086 CE A.H., in the town of Shahrist\u0101n, (Khorasan, province of Persia) where he acquired his early traditional education. Later, he was sent to N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br where he studied under different masters who were all disciples of the Ash`ari theologian al-Juwayn\u012b (d. 1085). At the age of thirty, al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b went to Baghdad to pursue theological studies and taught for three years at the prestigious Ash`ari school, al-Niz\u0101miyya. Afterwards, he returned to Persia where he worked as N\u0101\u2019ib (Deputy) of the chancellery for Sanjar, the Salj\u016bq ruler of Khur\u0101s\u0101n. At the end of his life, al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b went back to live in his native town, where he died in the year 1153. ==Works== Al-Shahrastani distinguished himself by his desire to describe in the most objective way the universal religious history of humanity.Watt 1991, p. 68. This is reflected in his Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal (The Book of Sects and Creeds), a monumental work, which presents the doctrinal points of view of all the religions and philosophies which existed up to his time. The book was one of the earliest systematic studies of religion, and is noted for its non-polemical style and scientific approach.Watt 1991, p. 68. A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by UNESCO (Livre des religions et des sectes. Peeters: 1986, 1993). Al-Shahrastani's philosophical and theological thoughts manifested in his other major works, which include: * The Nihayat al-aqdam fi 'ilm al-kalam (The End of Steps in the Science of Theology) presents different theological discussions and shows the limits of Muslim theology (kalam). * The Majlis is a discourse, written during the mature period of his life, delivered to a Twelver Shi`ite audience. * The Musara`at al-Falasifa (The Struggle with Philosophers) criticizes Ibn Sina (Avicenna)\u2019s doctrines by emphasizing some peculiar Isma'ili arguments on the division of beings. * The Mafatih al-Asrar wa-masabih al-abrar (The Keys of the Mysteries and the Lamps of the Righteous) introduces the Qur\u2019an and gives a complete commentary on the first two chapters of the Qur\u2019an. ==Religious belief== Although self-identified and generally perceived as an Sunni-Ash'ari, as can be seen in his books, Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, and Nihayat al-Iqdam fi 'Ilm al-Kalam. A few of his contemporaries accused him of covertly being an Isma'ili. ==Christian commentary== In Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal, al- Shahrastani records a portrayal of Christianity very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative: > \u201cThe Christians. (They are) the community (umma) of the Christ, Jesus, son > of Mary (peace upon him). He it is who was truly sent (as prophet; mab'uth) > after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him > were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of > the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and > innate disposition (fitra) are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, > his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. > For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age > of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the > cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at > (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (da'wa) was > three years and three months and three days.\u201dWatt 1991, p. 68. Al-Shahrastani also explains the differences between Christians in Kitab al- Milal wa al-Nihal regarding the incarnation (tajassud): > \u201cThey affirmed that God has three hypostases (aqanim). They said that the > Creator (may he be exalted) is one substance (jawhar), meaning by this what > is self-subsistent (al-qa'im bi-n-nafs), not (what is characterized by) > spatial location and physical magnitude; and he is one in substantiality, > three in hypostaticity (uqnumiyya). By the hypostases they mean the > attributes (sifat), such as existence, life and knowledge, and the father, > the son and the holy spirit (ruh al-qudus). The (hypostasis of) knowledge > clothes itself and was incarnated, but not the other hypostases.\u201dWatt 1991, > p. 69. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== ; Works and studies in English * al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b, The Summa philosophiae, (Kit\u0101b Nih\u0101yatu \u02bcl-Iqd\u0101m f\u012b \u02bdIlmi \u02bcl \u2013Kal\u0101m), edited with a translation by Alfred Guillaume, London, Oxford University Press 1934. * Muhammad b.
