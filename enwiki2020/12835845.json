    "text": "The Dornier Viper was a West German/Norwegian air-to-air missile project, intended to replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder, in Luftwaffe service from 1975/76. The Viper was developed by Bodenseewerk and Dornier Systems, using an infrared seeker and a new solid-fuel rocket motor (by Kongsberg Vapenfabrik), intended to have twice the burn time of the Sidewinder. In 1974, the Viper was abandoned in favor of evaluating an American missile. *Length: *Diameter: *Weight: ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * . * .
