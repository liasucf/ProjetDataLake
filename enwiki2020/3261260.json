    "text": "Paititi is a legendary Inca lost city or utopian rich land. It allegedly lies east of the Andes, hidden somewhere within the remote rainforests of southeast Peru, northern Bolivia or southwest Brazil. The Paititi legend in Peru revolves around the story of the culture-hero Inkarri, who, after he had founded Q'ero and Cusco, retreated toward the jungles of Pantiacolla to live out the rest of his days in his refuge city of Paititi. Other versions of the legend see Paititi as an Inca refuge in the border area between Bolivia and Brazil. ==Recent findings== In 2001, the Italian archaeologist, Mario Polia, discovered the report of the missionary Andres Lopez in the archives of the Jesuits in Rome.Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu In the document, which dates from about 1600, Lopez describes a large city rich in gold, silver, and jewels, located in the middle of the tropical jungle called Paititi by the natives. Lopez informed the Pope about his discovery. See http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=paiti4 Lopez's report and its discovery were widely publicized, though its content is third-hand and far from reliable, Lopez himself having never reached Paititi but only having heard about it from the natives. It focuses on the story of a miracle performed at the court of the king of Paititi by a crucifix taken there by a group of baptized Indians. Many other historical sources of the Colonial period (16th to 18th centuries) refer to Paititi, to its possible locations and to expeditions searching for it. Some of the most informative of these documents include those of (1570), Gregorio Bol\u00edvar (1621), Juan Recio de Le\u00f3n (1623\u201327), Juan de Ojeda (1676), Diego de Eguiluz (1696). In 2001, two researchers from the University of Helsinki, Dr. (archaeologist) and Dr. Martti P\u00e4rssinen (historian), put forward a hypothesis relating the Paititi legend to the Inca expeditions into the Amazonian jungle and to the possible Inca military presence in the region of the Beni and the Madre de Dios rivers.Siiri\u00e4inen, Ari and P\u00e4rssinen, Martti. The Amazonian Interests of the Inca State (Tawantinsuyu). In: Baessler-Archiv N\u00ba49. Berlin. 2001. In order to test this hypothesis, a joint Finnish-Bolivian archaeological expedition in 2001\u20132003 investigated the fortified site Las Piedras near the town of Riberalta in Eastern Bolivia. Some fragments of imperial Inca ceramics were found during the excavations, but the presumed Inca origin of the site remains questionable.See P\u00e4rssinen, Martti y Siiri\u00e4inen, Ari.

Producciones CIMA: La Paz. 2003. Historian and anthropologist Vera Tyuleneva has contributed to the idea of the non-Peruvian origin of the name \"Paititi\" and its original locale; she has made expeditions to northern Bolivia and provided extensive and detailed written reports on her findings.Tyuleneva, Vera.

The first part of this article concerning Paititi in the oral tradition is still relevant, while the second part related to the historical sources has been since radically reconsidered by the author On 29 December 2007, members of a local community near Kimbiri, Peru, found large stone structures resembling high walls, covering an area of 40,000 square meters; they named it the Manco Pata fortress. Researchers from the Peruvian government's Cusco-based National Institute of Culture (INC), however, disputed suggestions by the local mayor that it could be part of the lost city of Paititi. Their report identified the stone structures as naturally formed sandstone. In 2008, the municipality of Kimbiri decided to promote it as a tourist destination. Recent historical work by the explorer Andrew Nicol examined primary historical texts and concluded that a jungle city or remote Inca outpost, such as the city described by the Paititi legend, could theoretically exist within the Peruvian Amazon Basin. ==Expeditions in search of Paititi during the past 100 years== * 1925: Percy Harrison Fawcett (Mato Grosso, Brasil).Fawcett, Percy Harrison.

The party's guides left after a 30-day agreement expired, and though the three continued on, they never returned. Japanese explorer Yoshiharu Sekino contacted Machiguenga Indians in the area the following year and confirmed that the expedition members had been killed. * 1984 to 2011: various expeditions led by Gregory Deyermenjian, member of The Explorers Club.

He disappeared somewhere in the unexplored parts of Bolivia. * In June 2001, the Kota Mama II expedition led by John Blashford-Snell located some significant ancient ruins in the jungle east of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia that are believed to be identical to those discovered earlier by Hans Ertl. * 2001: Thierry Jamin investigates the site of Pantiacolla. The pyramids are in fact natural formations but Jamin discovered several Inca artefacts in the same area. * 2002: Jacek Pa\u0142kiewicz undertook an expedition. * The June 2004 \"Quest for Paititi\" exploration team of Deyermenjian and Mamani discovered several important Inca ruins along branches of the Inca Road of Stone at the peak known as \u00daltimo Punto in the northern part of the Pantiacolla region of Peru.Quest for Paititi * 2005: The French explorer Thierry Jamin and the French-Peruvian Herbert Cartagena studied Pusharo petroglyphs and reported to have seen large geoglyphs in a valley nearby. They thought they might have found a \"map\" showing where Paititi might be located.
