    "text": "Ernst Sigismund Fischer (12 July 1875 \u2013 14 November 1954) was a mathematician born in Vienna, Austria. He worked alongside both Mertens and Minkowski at the Universities of Vienna and Zurich, respectively. He later became professor at the University of Erlangen, where he worked with Emmy Noether. His main area of research was mathematical analysis, specifically orthonormal sequences of functions which laid groundwork for the emergence of the concept of a Hilbert space. The Riesz\u2013Fischer theorem in Lebesgue integration is named in his honour. He is the grandson of composer Karl Graedener.Ernst Sigismund Fischer http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fischer.html. ==References== == External links == * * Category:Austrian mathematicians Category:Austrian expatriates in Switzerland Category:Austrian expatriates in Germany Category:Scientists from Vienna Category:1875 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Austro-Hungarian mathematicians ",
