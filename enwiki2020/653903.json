At the 2006 census, Farina had a population of 55. On the edge of the desert, it sits within the Lake Eyre Basin and it is situated on the old alignment of the Ghan railway, north of Lyndhurst and south of Marree where the Oodnadatta Track and the Birdsville Track commence. ==History== Ruins of the Exchange Hotel, Farina Originally called The Gums or Government Gums,Basil Fuller: The Ghan \u2013 The Story of the Alice Springs Railway. Sydney 1975. ND 2003. Farina was settled in 1878 by optimistic farmers hoping that rain follows the plough.http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/travel/destinations/2010/05/six- of-the-best-ghost-towns/ Brennan, Bridget (2010). \"Six of the best ghost towns\", Australian Geographic, Issue 97, 21 May. The town was the railhead for a time until 1884 before the railway was extended to Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 \u00bc-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall is nowhere near enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in the surrounding area. Farina grew to reach a peak population of approximately 600 in the late 1800s. In its heyday, the town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and the Exchange) and an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school and a brothel. In 1909, a iron meteorite was discovered north-east of the town. Today nothing but stone ruins and the elevated railway water tank remain of the township. The post office closed in the 1960s and the railway line closed in the 1980s. The town is no longer inhabited, with the closest residents now living at Farina station, visible to the west of the town. A bush camping area is maintained by the owners of Farina station. In 2008 Farina Restoration Group was formed, and in May 2009, 30 people attended a 14-day restoration program at Farina. Volunteer efforts have been made to restore the town, including the repair of the bakery and the addition of informational signs. ===Cemeteries=== The town's cemetery is located a few kilometres away via a signposted track. Of interest is the Afghan corner of the cemetery which contains several headstones with both English and Arabic inscriptions, plus several headstones without inscriptions, marking the resting place of former Farina residents of Afghan origin who were involved in or connected to the Afghan camel trains which used to provide transport services before the railway was extended. All the gravestones face Mecca in the Islamic tradition. === World War I === During World War I, 33 men who were born in Farina enlisted for the duration of the war and for four months after its end. All of them were volunteers. The first man enlisted at Helena Vale in South Australia on 28 August 1914 and joined the 11th Battalion. The last man enlisted on the 23 March 1918. Of the 33 men who went to war from Farina, 5 were killed in action, 10 were wounded and one died at sea, en route to England. One of the youngest men to enlist was William James Denham Robinson... he was 15 and had an alias of Charles Robison. He was born in Mt. Lyndhurst and lived in Farina and was in WW1 and WW2. The last survivors were discharged on 16 August 1920. === World War II === Farina war memorial During World War II, 35 men born in Farina enlisted.
