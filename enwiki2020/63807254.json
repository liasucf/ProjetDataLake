    "text": "Phosphosiderite is a rare mineral named for its main components, phosphate and iron. The siderite at the end of phosphosiderite comes from \"sideros\", the Greek word for iron. It was discovered in 1890. It is mined in some parts of Chile, Argentina, Germany, Portugal, and the United States. It is totally soluble in Hydrochloric acid and nearly insoluble in nitric acid.Anthony et al, Handbook of Mineralogy (2001) It is usually cut into a cabochon shape. Phosphosiderite is known as \u201cPiedrea voga\u201d meaning pink stone or \u201cLa Roca Voca\u201d, translating to pink rock in many other countries. == Colors == The very fascinating, rare gemstone is often found in a bright orchid-purple tint with yellow-colored streaks. These vein-like streaks found in the stone are known as cacoxenite. The other rare color variants and the most precious ones are rose red, brown-reddish yellow, mossy green, and darker hues of purple. The most magnificent is the colorless variant of Phosphosiderite. == References == Category:Monoclinic minerals ",
