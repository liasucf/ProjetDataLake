Sir John Clifton's father was a London merchant, Sir William Clifton (d.1564), who had purchased the manor of Barrington from Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Victoria County History, Vol.4, Somerset, Baggs, A.P. & Bush, R.J.E., Bush, Parishes: Barrington ed. R W Dunning, London, 1978, pp. 113-121 Sir William Clifton was the son of Gervase Clifton of the Customs House, London, a younger son of Sir Gervase Clifton (d.1508), Knight of the Bath (1494), of Clifton Hall, Nottingham, High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests in 1502.The History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby Vol 1 (1831) Stephen Glover. Appendix p 10 Henry VII. From Robert Clifton, the eldest son of Sir Gervase Clifton (d.1508), were descended the Clifton baronets, which title was created in 1611.Debrett, John, The Baronetage of England, revised, corrected and continued by G.W. Collen, London, 1840, p.119 ==Career== He was educated at St Alban Hall, Oxford (1586), Gray's Inn (1588). In 1591, he became a Knight of the Shire of Huntingdonshire, settled in Leighton Bromswold and married Katherine, a daughter of Sir Henry Darcy (a previous Knight of the Shire) that year and was knighted by 1597. From 1597 to 1598 and also in 1601, Clifton was MP for Huntingdonshire. In 1605 he sold his paternal estate of Barrington Court and moved his seat to Leighton Bromswold, County Huntingdon. In 1608 he was raised to the Peerage by writ of summons Baron Clifton, of Leighton Bromswold, County Huntingdon. This ancient form of creation by writ enabled the title to descend via female lines. On 30 December 1617, Lord Clifton was imprisoned in the Tower of London for threatening Sir Francis Bacon when the latter ordered a survey of Clifton's land. He was then prosecuted by the Star Chamber on 17 March 1618 and moved to Fleet Prison, where he stabbed himself to death in the following October. His only son had died in 1602 as a result of wounds received from a bear, which had broken free during a bear-baiting show at Nottingham, and so Clifton's title passed to his daughter, Katherine. ==References== ==Sources== * History of Parliament * Tudor Place * Burke's Peerage & Gentry, 107th edition Category:1570s births Category:1618 deaths Category:Alumni of St Alban Hall, Oxford Category:Nobility who committed suicide Category:Suicides in London Category:Suicides by sharp instrument in England Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:English people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in England and Wales detention Gervase Category:Inmates of Fleet Prison Category:English MPs 1597\u20131598 Category:English MPs 1601 Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Male suicides Category:British politicians who committed suicide 1 ",
