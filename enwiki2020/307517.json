    "text": "Edward Albert \"Ed\" Feigenbaum (born January 20, 1936) is a computer scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence, and joint winner of the 1994 ACM Turing Award.David Alan Grier. (Oct.-Dec. 2013). \"Edward Feigenbaum [interview].\" Annals of the History of Computing. p. 74-81. He is often called the \"father of expert systems.\" ==Education and early life== Feigenbaum was born in Weehawken, New Jersey in 1936 to a culturally Jewish family, and moved to nearby North Bergen, where he lived until the age of 16, when he left to start college.Knuth, Don. \"Oral History of Edward Feigenbaum, Computer History Museum, 2007. Accessed October 23, 2015. \"I was born in Weehawken, New Jersey, which is a town on the Palisades opposite New York. In fact, it\u2019s the place where the Lincoln Tunnel dives under the water and comes up in New York. Then my parents moved up the Palisades four miles to a town called North Bergen, and there I lived until I was 16 and went off to Carnegie Tech.\" His hometown didn't have a secondary school of its own and he chose Weehawken High School for its college preparatory program.Lederberg, Joshua. \"How DENDRAL was conceived and born\", United States National Library of Medicine, November 5, 1987. Accessed October 23, 2015. \"I became an expert on its use. I even remember dragging it with me miles on the bus to Weehawken High School, heavy as it was, just to show off my skill with this marvelous technology that no other kid in the high school knew anything about.\" He was inducted into his high school's hall of fame in 1996.Hague, Jim. \"Academic awards aplenty; Weehawken honors top students, inducts Pasquale into Hall of Fame\", Hudson Reporter, May 13, 2000. Accessed October 23, 2015. \"Edward Feigenbaum (Class of '53) in 1996\" Feigenbaum completed his undergraduate degree (1956), and a Ph.D. (1960), at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). In his Ph.D thesis, carried out under the supervision of Herbert A. Simon, he developed EPAM, one of the first computer models of how people learn. ==Career and research== Feigenbaum completed a Fulbright Fellowship at the National Physics Laboratory and in 1960 went to the University of California, Berkeley, to teach in the School of Business Administration. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1965 as one of the founders of its computer science department. He was the director of the Stanford Computation Center from 1965 to 1968. He established the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University. Important projects that Ed was involved in include systems in medicine, as ACME, Mycin, SUMEX, and Dendral. He also co-founded companies IntelliCorp and Teknowledge. Since 2000 Ed Feigenbaum is a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Stanford University. His former doctoral students include Peter Karp, Niklaus Wirth, and Alon Halevy. ===Honors and awards=== * 1984: Selected as one the initial fellows of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) * 1994: Turing Award jointly with Raj Reddy for \"pioneering the design and construction of large scale artificial intelligence systems, demonstrating the practical importance and potential commercial impact of artificial intelligence technology\". * 1997: U.S. Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Award * 2007: Inducted as fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) * 2011: IEEE Intelligent Systems AI's Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems\".
