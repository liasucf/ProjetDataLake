Railroad Square Art District is an arts, culture and entertainment district of Tallahassee, Florida, located off Railroad Avenue (just south of the Amtrak station and FAMU), filled with a variety of metal art sculptures and stores selling artwork and collectibles. Railroad Square is mainly known for its small locally owned shops and working artist studios, and its alternative art scene. Railroad Square Art District is the site of the former McDonnell Lumber Company. Most of the warehouses there were originally constructed in the 1940s. The property later became the Downtown Industrial Park. In the 1950s it was acquired by The Boynton Family, who, three generations later, still own much of the property today. It was the second generation of Boynton owners, Nan Boynton, who was the one responsible for bringing the artists into the park and renaming it \"Railroad Square\" in the 1980s. The site has hosted a microbrewery, rock climbing gym, local coffee shops, art galleries, art studios, vintage shops, and more. There are currently over 70 tenants of the Railroad Square community. The other businesses listed below are newer but are located in these historic railroad warehouses as well. Railroad Square hosts First Friday (the first Friday of each month)\u2014 an art crawl event with live music and food trucks. == Gallery == File:Railroad Square Art Park.JPG|Entrance to Railroad Square.
