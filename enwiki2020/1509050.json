    "text": "The Chandalar River (T'eedriinjik in Gwich'in) is a tributary of the Yukon River in the U.S. state of Alaska. Its peak flow, recorded by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) between 1964 and 1974 at a stream gauge at Venetie, was on June 9, 1968. The Chandalar River main stem begins at the confluence of the North Fork Chandalar River and the Middle Fork Chandalar River and flows generally southeast through the state's northern interior southeast of the Philip Smith Mountains of the Brooks Range. The Chandalar enters the Yukon River northwest of Fort Yukon. ==Major tributaries== North Fork Chandalar River, long,Alaska Place Names, p. 698 begins near Atigun Pass in the Brooks Range and flows generally southeast through Chandalar Lake to meet the Middle Fork and form the main stem. At the North Fork headwaters is a flat valley known as Chandalar shelf just east of the Dalton Highway, where caribou are known to winter. The Middle Fork Chandalar RiverAlaska Place Names, p. 638 heads up in the Philip Smith Mountains east of Atigun Pass. It flows generally south from the mountains to join the North Fork. East Fork Chandalar River, long,Alaska Place Names, p. 296 starts near the Romanzof Mountains in the eastern Brooks Range. From there, it flows generally southwest past Arctic Village to enter the main stem upstream of Venetie. West Fork Chandalar River, a tributary of the North Fork Chandalar River, flows east from mountainous terrain east of Coldfoot. It joins the North Fork upstream of that stream's confluence with the Middle Fork.Alaska Place Names, p. 1036 ==Recreation== Although the lower river can be fished for northern pike, sheefish and salmon, the upper river, its tributaries, headwaters, and nearby lakes offer \"the most exciting fishing possibilities\". The main sportfishing species in the basin are northern pike, Arctic grayling, charr, and lake trout. Anglers and hunters typically enter the region by airplane or, in winter, by snowmobile. It is possible for experienced boaters to float and fish the river system in rafts or kayaks. Hazards include shallows and rapids. There are no public campgrounds or other facilities; however, there is a fishing lodge at Chandalar Lake. ==Gallery== File:ChandalarRiver2.jpg|Sunrise over the East Fork of the Chandalar River, in the Brooks Range File:Chandalar River in summer.jpg|Chandalar River in summer File:Chandalar River in winter.jpg|Chandalar River in winter File:Chandalar River Valley.jpg|Mountain in the Chandalar River Valley ==See also== *List of rivers of Alaska == References == ==Works cited== * ==External links== *Chandalar River Valley Mountain, north of Arctic Village Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska Category:Brooks Range Category:Tributaries of the Yukon River Category:Rivers of Unorganized Borough, Alaska ",
