    "text": "The 2012 Asia Cup (also called Micromax Asia Cup) was an international cricket tournament held in Bangladesh from 11 to 22 March 2012. Like the previous event, the tournament featured the four Test-playing nations from Asia: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. India entered the tournament as the defending 2010 Asia Cup Pakistan won the tournament by beating Bangladesh in the final by 2 runs. ==Background== China was interested to host the Asia Cup at Guangzhou but it was decided by the Asian Cricket Council that Bangladesh will host the event. It was the third time Bangladesh hosted the event after 1988 and 2000. The event was supposed to be held between 1 and 11 March 2012, but was rescheduled to avoid conflicting with the ODI tri-series in Australia that also included Sri Lanka and India, which ended on 8 March. The tournament was played from 11 to 22 March. ==Venues== All the 7 matches were played at Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium, Mirpur. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:40%; margin:auto\" !City !!

(A team's run rate is number of runs scored divided by number of overs faced, except that a team is treated as having faced the full 50 overs if it loses all of its wickets) If two or more teams have the same number of points, the right to play in the final is determined as follows: * The team having the higher number of wins. * If two or more teams have same number of wins, the team with more wins against the other teams who have equal number of points and wins. (Head to head) * If still equal, the team with the higher number of bonus points. * If still equal, the team with the greater net run rate. ==Matches== ===Group stage matches=== All times local (UTC+06:00) \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Final=== == Records and statistics == === Batting === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" !
