    "text": "\"Whippin\" is a song by American singer Kiiara, featuring American electronic music producer Felix Snow and would act as the third single from her first studio album Lil Kiiwi. It was released on April 12, 2017 via Atlantic Records. == Composition == \"Whippin\" is in the key of F minor, and moves at a tempo of 83 beats per minute in a 4/4 time signature. It features electronic voice glitches over a hip hop-inspired beat. It was compared to her hit single \"Gold.\" ==Critical reception== Mike Wass of Idolator said \"'Whippin' is all about capturing a vibe via a repetitive chorus and demented electronic production. There is a little more bite this time, however, courtesy of Kiiara's fiery verses.\" Sam Murphy of The Interns wrote that \"there are similarities to 'Gold' but ultimately it\u2019s a new beast with even sweeter hooks.\" The Musical Hype was more critical of the song, writing that it called for \"no need for deep analysis.\" He additionally called the second verse \"forced,\" and wrote that \"anyone could\u2019ve recorded 'Whippin.'\" == Music video == The music video for \"Whippin\" was released on May 8, 2017 and it was directed by Colin Tiley. It features Kiiara on a variety of different modes of transportation. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Tip) | 13 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 9 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !
