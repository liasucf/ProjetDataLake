    "text": "Federal Sales Taxes A comparison of tax rates by countries is difficult and somewhat subjective, as tax laws in most countries are extremely complex and the tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub- national unit. The list focuses on the main indicative types of taxes: corporate tax, individual income tax, and sales tax, including VAT and GST, but does not list capital gains tax. Some other taxes (for instance property tax, substantial in many countries, such as the United States) and payroll tax are not shown here. The table is not exhaustive in representing the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. The tax rates displayed are marginal and do not account for deductions, exemptions or rebates. The effective rate is usually lower than the marginal rate. The tax rates given for federations (such as the United States and Canada) are averages and vary depending on the state or province. Territories that have different rates to their respective nation are in italics. == Tax rates by countries and territories == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 16%;\" | Country ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 17%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Corporate tax (excl. dividend taxes) ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 17%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Income tax ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 17%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Income tax ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 17%;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | VAT or GST or sales tax ! scope=\"col;\" style=\"width: 16%;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Further reading |- | | 20% | 0% | 20% | 0% | Taxation in Afghanistan |- | | 20% | 0% | 23% | 20% 6% |Taxation in Albania |- | | 26% 19% | 0% | 35% | 19% 9% | Taxation in Algeria |- | | 44% 15% | 4% | 6% | 0% | Taxation in American Samoa |- | | 10% | 10% | 10% | 4.5% 9.5% 2.5%, 1% or 0% | Taxation in Andorra |- | | 30% | 0% | 17% | 10% | Taxation in Angola |- | | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Taxation in Anguilla |- | | 30% for residents and 15% for non residents since 2021 | 9% | 35% | 21% | Taxation in Argentina |- | | 20% | 24.4% | 36% | 20% | Taxation in Armenia |- | | 25% | 7% | 58.95% | 1.5% | Taxation in Aruba |- | | 30% 28.5% Businesses with annual turnover above A$2 million pay 30%, all other business pay the lower 28.5% rate. | 0% | 45%Includes 2% Medicare levy.
