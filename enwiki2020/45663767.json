The Copleston Cross or Stone gave its name to the historic estate or manor of Copleston (modern: Coplestone) which was the earliest known home of the prominent historic Copleston family, one of the most ancient in Devon according to \"that old saw often used among us in discourse\", the traditional rhyme related by John Prince (d.1723):Prince, p.274 > \"Crocker, Cruwys, and Coplestone, > When the Conqueror came were at home\" The Cruwys family in 2014 still resides in its ancient manor house at Cruwys Morchard where, despite the traditional rhyme, it is first recorded in the reign of King John (1199\u20131216), or possibly a little earlier.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.380 The last male of the Crocker family of Lyneham in the parish of YealmptonCherry & Pevsner, p.553 in Devon was Courtenay Crocker (d.1740),Lysons, Daniel & Samuel, Magna Britannia, Volume 6, Devonshire (1822), Families removed since 1620, pp.173\u2013225 several times MP for Plympton.Prince, p.273 ==Descent in Coplestone family== Arms of Copleston: Argent, a chevron engrailed gules between three lions' faces azure Arms of Copleston, detail from 15th century Copleston Prayer DeskCherry & Pevsner, p.276 in St Andrew's Church, Colebrooke The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640) wrote concerning the parish of Colebrooke:Risdon, p.97 > \"In this tything is Coplestone, which hath given name to a numerous family > who for their fair possessions, their port (sic) (report?) and the respect > they lived in, were intitled 'the Great Coplestones' besides dignified with > the name of 'Whit Spurrs', some time a title of great note and in these > western parts of much esteem. Of this name are many branches sprung who > flourished in this county\" The Devon historian Sir William Pole (d.1635) stated the honour accorded to this family as \"Silver Spurr\", similar to Risdon's appellation, and added that it was connected to the fact that although they were a great county family which had married well, unusually no member of the family had ever been knighted, adding that the family was known as \"the great Copleston\" on account of their great revenue.Pole, p.225 The principal junior branches of the Copleston family were seated at the Devon manors or estates of: Bowden in the parish of Yealmpton, Instow, Upton Pyne, Kingdon in the parish of Alverdiscott, Woodland in the parish of Little Torrington, Weare Giffard, EggesfordPedigrees of foregoing branches given in Vivian, pp.226\u2013233 and Bicton.
