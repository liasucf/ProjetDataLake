Then Congressman Gaudencio Abordo sponsored the bill establishing the college at the then municipality of Puerto Princesa. The creation of PTC was in response to the need of additional teachers in the province since most of the available educators at that time came from Luzon; and only a handful were willing to be assigned in far-flung areas of the province. Funded by an initial half-a-million pesos, the university opened night classes to 101 students under the tutelage of 10 faculty members, and 16 support staff, using four borrowed classrooms from state-funded Palawan National High School. Its first president was Dr. Walfrido Ponce de Leon, and five different presidents since. The early days of the institution as a teacher\u2019s College saw its thrust focused solely on education degree. Years later however, the school added new curriculum to address the province's other educational needs. In 1984, then Minister of Natural Resources Teodoro Pe\u00f1a sponsored the transition of Palawan Teacher\u2019s College to Palawan State College by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 797, allowing for the university to offer courses in the Art, Sciences and Technology. Dr. Heracleo Lagrada succeeded Dr. Ponce de Leon as president in 1985 and a year later succeeded by Prof. Paterno Bruselas. In 1991, Dr. Teresita Salva became its fourth president, with the institution championing the cause of being the \u201cPlace for Social Change.\u201d After her term, Dr. Salva would return for another tenure in 1999 until her retirement in 2011. Under Salva's administration, PSE established its law school, supervised by it first dean, Atty. Teodoro Pe\u00f1a. It was also under the stewardship of Dr. Salva that effort to have Palawan State College be conferred the university status. It was however only on November 12, 1994, under the stewardship of PSU's fifth president Dr. Crispiniano Acosta, that Palawan State College was elevated into a university by virtue of R.A. 7818, sponsored by congressman Alfredo Abueg, Jr. and David Ponce de Leon. PSU in 1995, then offered 11 new academic programs \u2013 Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Marine Biology, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Agri-Business and Hotel and Restaurant Management, four diploma courses, and the first Petroleum Engineering course in the Philippines. In 1999, Salva returned as university president. Presently, PSU is under the stewardship of its president Dr. Marissa S. Pontillas succeeding Dr. Jeter Sespe\u00f1e. ==Campuses== Palawan State University (PSU) has two major campuses: the Manalo Campus, where the Laboratory Elementary School, Graduate School and School of Law are, and the Main Campus in Tiniguiban Heights, which houses the administration building, the colleges, the Laboratory High School, and the physical plant offices. In addition, a number of extramural studies and programs are being offered in the Palawan State University's College of Community Resources and Development (CCRD) in rural campuses of Rizal, Narra, Quezon, Araceli, Brooke's Point, San Vicente, Cuyo, Coron, Balabac, Roxas, Taytay, El Nido, Linapacan, San Rafael, Sofronio Espa\u00f1ola, Dumaran and Bataraza. ==Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program== In response to the call of time, Palawan State University opened another avenue of learning for non-degree holders but currently working in the different offices and industries who may want to finish their degrees without moving out of their work area. During the 365th meeting of the Board of the Commission on Higher Education held last December 13, 2010, in Manila through CEB Resolution No. 328-2010, the commission approved the University\u2019s application for the deputation to offer Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering effective January 2011 until January 2016 via Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP). Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) is a comprehensive educational assessment program which recognizes knowledge, skills, attitudes and values obtained by individuals from formal, non-formal and informal education and training and related work experiences.
