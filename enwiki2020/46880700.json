It restored most of the provisions of the Treaty of Hadiach, except for the elevation of Ruthenia to the status equal of the Poland and Lithuania. It invalidated the Pereyaslav Articles. The treaty was signed following the Polish victory at the Battle of Chudnov. The treaty meant that the Cossacks withdrew their support from Russia in the Russo-Polish War (1654\u201367), and transferred it back to the Commonwealth. The war would eventually be concluded with the 1667 Treaty of Andrusovo. ==References== Category:1658 in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Poland\u2013Ukraine military relations Category:1660 treaties Chudnov Chudnov Category:17th century in the Zaporozhian Host ",
