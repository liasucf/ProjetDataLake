His father Ismail was a farmer and his mother was Ratina (both deceased), and he was the sixth child of seven siblings. He failed Indonesia's national university entrance examinations in 1988 and 1989 before he passed the exam in 1990 and gained admission to the Faculty of Law at Andalas University, Padang, West Sumatra. While studying there he wrote about the need for a constitutional court in Indonesia (it was only established later in 2003), including it in his undergraduate thesis.
