Her father left the family when she was four, and in 1988 her mother married builder Paul Price, after which she acquired the surname Price.

Helen Jones, chairman of the parliamentary Petitions Committee subsequently commented: \"The law on online abuse is not fit for purpose and it is truly shameful that disabled people have been forced off social media while their abusers face no consequences. There is no excuse for the continued failure to make online platforms as safe for disabled people as non-disabled people. Self-regulation has failed disabled people and the law must change to ensure more lives are not destroyed.\" and went on to make recommendations for legislation. The Government is expected to respond to the recommendations by the end of March 2019. == Personal life == === Family === Price gave birth to her first child, son Harvey, in Brighton in May 2002.
