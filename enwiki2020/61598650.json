In Europe, the game was released as Top Gear Rally 2. ==Reception== Top Gear Pocket 2 received generally favorable reviews from video game publications. At the time of its release, IGN reviewer Craig Harris considered it one of the best racing games on the Game Boy Color, stating that the game had been \"tweaked and refined as a quality racing game\", and concluding that its increasing difficulty offers a proper challenge as players progress through the game. However, he criticized the multiplayer mode because of its \"catch-up\" feature, noting that the \"only real challenge is trying to keep behind the other person and guess when the final stretch approaches so you can win.\" AllGame criticized the car attributes for being unbalanced, noting that the top speed is the only one that has a significant impact on the gameplay, but still considered the game enjoyable to play due to its sensation of speed. The British video game magazie Planet Game Boy highlighted the game's speed and pace, especially as better cars are unlocked, while the Spanish official Nintendo magazine Nintendo Acci\u00f3n praised the graphic improvements over its predecessor, stating that the cars are more detailed and that sharp curves and elevation changes are better animated. ==References== ;Notes ;Citation ==External links== * Category:2000 video games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Game Boy Color-only games Category:Kemco games Category:Vatical Entertainment games Category:Off-road racing video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Top Gear series Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
