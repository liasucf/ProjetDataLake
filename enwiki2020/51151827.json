    "text": "Sentinel Rock State Park is a state park in Westmore, Vermont. It is open for hiking, educational pursuits, hunting, and trapping. The property is named after its signature feature, Sentinel Rock, a huge glacial boulder situated at an elevation of about above sea level. The park is mostly undeveloped, and features a parking area, interpretative signage and ADA accessible trails that lead visitors to Sentinel Rock and to the former site of a farmhouse. The land was previously a farm and was donated to the state in 1997 by its owner, Windsor Wright. Portions of the park continue to be managed as sustainable agricultural and forest land. ==References== ==External links== * Sentinel Rock State Park Category:State parks of Vermont Category:Protected areas of Orleans County, Vermont Category:Westmore, Vermont Category:2015 establishments in Vermont ",
