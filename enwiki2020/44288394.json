    "text": "Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 (March 27, 1927 \u2013 April 16, 2014) was a Croatian sculptor. ==Early childhood and life during the war== Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 was born on March 27, 1927, in the village of Zaostrog, on Makarska Riviera. His father Ante and mother Iva (maiden name Jela\u010di\u0107) had six children - Ivan, Stipe, Ante, Rudolf, Milka and Ver\u0111ina. From the earliest age, the shapes of rocks, light and shadow play and the lavish colours of nature around Biokovo Mountain fascinate young Rudolf. Even as a small child, he felt the calling to become a sculptor. At the age of fifteen, he witnessed the horror of war for the first time in August 1942 when the Italian army sentenced the boy Matutinovi\u0107, along with several other people from the village, to death by execution. They were saved by Franciscan friars from the Zaostrostrog Monastery. In the fall of 1943, he found himself on Hvar Island with the army brigade of Biokovo-Neretva County, and was later sent to El Shatt refugee camp, located in the desert near the Suez Canal. There, along with some partisan duties, he managed to attend an improvised art school, managed by the painter \u017divko Kljakovi\u0107 from Split. Some other teachers from Split also worked at the school. The natural talent of young Matutinovi\u0107 became immediately obvious. Professor Mate Radmilovi\u0107 even suspected the authenticity of one of his works, attributing it to his colleague professor Kljakovi\u0107. These successful works were stored in the professor's own portfolio and later exhibited in Cairo. The works have been saved and preserved by Ranko Marinkovi\u0107 - an act of special encouragement and great honour for Matutinovi\u0107. These pioneer works made during Matutinovi\u0107's exile in 1944 ('Portrait of Bruno', drawing with chalk; 'Portrait of a man', drawing with chalk) are now on display in Zagreb's Historical and School Museums. Matutinovi\u0107 lost both his parents during the war. His mother died in 1944, and shortly afterward, after being imprisoned and tortured in an enemy camp in the city of Osijek, his father died in Zaostrog in 1945. After the end of war, Matutinovi\u0107 refused to take up any political position in the youth organization and consequently relinquished any possibility of political and financial support for the study of fine arts. He continued with his work and studies. That same year, he enrols in the sculpture department of the Arts and Crafts School in Split. In 1948, he graduates from the Arts and Crafts School in Zagreb. His professors were Ivan Mirkovi\u0107 and Davorin Hotko. ==Education== In 1948 Matutinovi\u0107 passes the entrance exam at the Academy of Fine Arts and begins the long-coveted study of sculpture. Among his colleagues were Borka Avramova, Veljko Boduli\u0107, Ivan Mitrovi\u0107, Boro Mitri\u010devski, Vladimir Dori\u0107, Marijan Kockovi\u0107 and Vera Fi\u0161er. Together they made up a very successful generation and many of them remain renowned and praised artists to this day. He studied under Grgo Antunac, Andrija Krstulovi\u0107, Frano Kr\u0161ini\u0107, Vjekoslav Ruklja\u010d and others. During his college years, in 1951, he sculpted a portrait of his colleague Borka Avramova \u2013 his first work of art made in stone (Figure 1). Figure 1 \u2013 Borka Avramova In 1953, he graduates with honours from the class of professor Fran Kr\u0161ini\u0107. This diploma opens up numerous opportunities to work with great sculptor masters of the time. From July 1st until December 1st he worked as an apprentice in the master shop of sculptor Vanja Radau\u0161. The collaboration between the famous sculptor Radau\u0161 and the free-minded young Matutinovi\u0107 was not long-lived. On November 15th 1953 young Matutinovi\u0107 writes: \"Dear Professor, I would hereby like to inform you that I have decided to leave your shop. Thank you for presenting me with the opportunity to work with you. Please forgive me if I have inadvertently done anything to offend you. I would like to thank you once again for everything you have done for me. With all my respect, R. Matutinovi\u0107. \" On December 16 that same year, he receives a scholarship from the Federal commission for cultural relations with foreign countries. He continues his studies in Paris from January 10 until March 27, 1954, Not long after, he begins his collaboration with professor Fran Kr\u0161ini\u0107 (from May 1, 1954 until September 15, 1958). This postgraduate course earns him a Master of Arts diploma. ==Work and pieces== Encouraged by professor Grga Antunc, a friend of Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, the young sculptor sends photographs of his works to Me\u0161trovi\u0107. Me\u0161trovi\u0107\u2019s response arrives shortly afterwards, dated August 6th, 1954: \"I hereby declare that I shall be happy to accept as talented a sculptor as Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 to my sculpture department art classes at the University in Syracuse, NY. Professor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Syracuse University, NY.\u201d Matutinovi\u0107\u2019s trip to the United States did not happen, however - the passionate artist hurt his back while working on a project, and, as he himself has noted: \"...The questions that I received from the American Embassy in Belgrade had a McCarthyist flavour that did not sit well with an immigrant from a socialist country...\" In 1955 his first exhibition opens in Zagreb. That same year he was admitted to the Croatian Association of Artists. From July 10th to August 20th he studied in Venice and Rome. In 1956 he married Ljerka Car, a famous poet and professor of literature from the town of Crikvenica. His son Igor is born in 1957. The creative oeuvre of Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 covered sculpture (portraits, nudes and figure) as well as monuments. He was also engaged in drawing. He modelled medals and illustrated books. The not very large register of sculptural themes recalls the tradition of the old masters one of the characteristics of whom was their concentration on a small number of topics. Such a constraint contributed to the attentive and meticulous workmanship of the statue. That this was really the case with Matutinovi\u0107 is shown by the broad spectrum in the selection of materials \u2013 stone, bronze, clay and plaster. He sought his own perfection; he left behind him only those works that he himself considered good. Human beings were the alpha and omega of Matutinovi\u0107's sculpture. And within this firm definition, the portrait dominated. This is a most important section of his sculpting oeuvre. And here the artist's choice of model was crucial, for he personally knew all the people he portrayed, and established an emotional relation with his sitters. The modelling sub served the creation of a real image of the person portrayed; it was there to get down to a combined and unified image of the internal and external characteristics of the personality. Every portrait became an artistic and documentary fact as well as a thing of worth. As far as craft skills are concerned, the sculptor Matutinovi\u0107 had mastered them all, but for him personally what was particularly important was the vital strength of the work. Some of his most famous portraits were done in the period 1957\u20131970 (\u2018Portrait of Veljko Despot\u2019; \u2018Portrait of boy Perica\u2019; \u2018Portrait of Ljerka Car Matutinovi\u0107\u2019(Figure 2)...)Ljerka Car Matutinovi\u0107. At the same time, he starts receiving support from the notable intellectuals of the time \u2013 writer and academic Marijan Matkovi\u0107 supported his idea to commemorate the suffering and victory of war. He worked on sculptures suitable for galleries, which could bring up interiors and exteriors. He also preferred to have his sculptures on permanent display. In an interview with the local magazine \u2018Vijenac\u2019 in early April 1958 Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 stated that he would prefer a life of work to a life of exhibitions. This statement quickly becomes the sculptor\u2019s motto, and he continues to live by it until his death. In 1968, in honour of the sculptor Ivan Mestrovi\u0107, Matutinovi\u0107 produced a medal, which represents a fragment of the monument to Njego\u0161 on Lov\u0107en Mountain. The tiny medal \u2013 only 6 cm in diameter \u2013 sought to preserve and highlight Mestrovi\u0107\u2019s specific artistic qualities. With this gesture, Matutinovi\u0107 has expressed his objections towards abstraction and the new trends that were neglecting the traditional values of arts and crafts. As well as the portrait work, one should certainly pause on Matutinovi\u0107's work with the female nude. The body is a challenge to the sculptor. The first thing we notice in the nudes is the sculptorly interest in the sum of impressions in the mass itself. The choice of female body for this artist means less the male evocation of sensuality and beauty, desire and passion, and refers more to the experiencing of various situations in life \u2013 Fortune, 1956; Invitation to Love, 1957; Cry of Grief, 1959; Desire, 1972. By the end of 1980s he has participated in 25 group exhibitions. More than 30 of his works of art in bronze and in stone are exhibited in public, mainly outdoors. In mid-90s, he finally finishes his masterpiece in stone \u201cLonging\u201d (Figure 3)Longing. His works are on display in museums, galleries and private collections in Florence, Paris, Hong Kong and New York. He received three awards for his contribution to the development of fine arts. He is also enlisted in the Yugoslav Art Encyclopaedia. Opportunities often took him from away from sculpture and into drawing. He painted family portraits, female nudes and illustrated books of his wife Ljerka Car Matutinovi\u0107. In 1980 he created the grandiose monument to fallen soldiers in Zaostrog \u2013 ten meters tall, built in white concrete and stone. From the 1960s to 1980s he worked closely with the Croatian Association of Artists (CAA) in Zagreb (the Governing Council and Arts Council) and participated in the work of the National Council for Culture. In 1996 he participated in the public contest for the monument to Alojzije Stepinac in Krasi\u0107. His suggestions were selected by Jasenka Horvat and Tihomir Juki\u0107 as the best urban location solution for the monument. Towards the end of his life, he spent most of his time in the studio working on some new portraits and various versions of older works. In his half century of work, Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 created a major artistic oeuvre, characterised by knowledge and honesty. He presented himself as painter and sculptor on the thematic journey of the universal and the personal, historical and recent, the intimate and the universally human. == References == * Marina Bari\u010devi\u0107 2010: Rudolf Matutinovi\u0107 (monograph).
