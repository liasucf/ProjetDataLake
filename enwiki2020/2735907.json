It was the largest known MBA Scholarship programme to be launched in Africa which would award 250 scholarships over a period of five years to people to study its flagship MBA programme. The scholarship programme was endorsed by Gra\u00e7a Machel, wife of former South African President Nelson Mandela, and enabled financially disadvantaged applicants across Africa to gain skills and expertise in management and business, helping them to effect change in their organisations and communities. To date, 55 scholars have graduated with their MBA and the remaining scholars are progressing well. The African Scholarship Scheme is now closed to new applications. ==References== ==External links== * *EBS Watercooler Portal Site Portal site containing study notes, photos and portal to EBS Watercooler Discussion Board on Delphi Forums site.
