    "text": "Big Babies is a 2010 British comedy children's television series, which was shown on CBBC, BBC Two the British Broadcasting Corporation's children's digital channel. The main characters are two babies (actually babies with adult heads and voices superimposed) named Brooks and Rocco, who are reluctantly dragged away from watching television to go on unpredictable adventures in the world of the everyday. However, the toys on the shelf always have concerns about what the babies are up to, and get Budge, one of their own, to tag along with the babies (which he does for his own selfish reasons). It is broadcast on CBBC and BBC Two in the UK, BBC Kids in Canada and ABC3 in Australia. In 2010, Big Babies was nominated for a BAFTA Children's Award in the section of Best Comedy.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1625109/awards ==Production== The concept of the show (adult heads superimposed on babies' bodies) came from an idea by music video director Jon Riche, who wanted to make a video featuring such an effect. Unable to find a band willing to use the concept, Riche produced a quick proof-of-concept clip with comedian Spencer Jones for a sketch show. Producer Jack Cheshire showed the clip to colleagues at the BBC, which led to the controller of CBBC commissioning a pilot and a thirteen-episode series.Thair, David: The Making of Big Babies, BBC Comedy Blog, 15 March 2010. ==Characters and cast== These are some of the main cast: ===The Babies=== *Brooks (Spencer Jones): The more cynical baby. His catchphrase is \"We should have stayed at home and watched the telly!\") His primary bonnet is white with bunny ears on top *Rocco (Martin Collins): Rocco is the more idealistic baby, complete with a beard. He idolises The Gonch, much to Brooks' disgust. His primary bonnet is white with mouse ears on top. *The Gonch (Dan Kirwan): The coolest kid in town, complete with bling bling.
