    "text": "As Seen Through a Telescope As Seen Through a Telescope (AKA: The Professor and His Field Glass) is a 1900 British short silent comedy film, directed by George Albert Smith, featuring an elderly gentleman getting a glimpse of a woman's ankle through a telescope. The three-shot comedy, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"uses a similar technique to that which G.A. Smith pioneered in Grandma's Reading Glass (1900),\" and although, \"the editing is unsophisticated, the film does at least show a very early example of how to make use of point-of-view close-ups in the context of a coherent narrative (which is this film's main advance on Grandma's Reading Glass).\" \"Smith's experiments with editing,\" Brooke concludes, \"were ahead of most contemporary film-makers, and in retrospect it can clearly be seen that he was laying the foundations of film grammar as we now understand it.\" ==Production== The film was shot in Furze Hill, Hove, England outside the entrance to St. Ann's Well Gardens, where Smith had his studio. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1900 films Category:British films Category:British silent short films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British comedy films Category:1900 comedy films Category:1900s short films Category:Films directed by George Albert Smith Category:Articles containing video clips ",
