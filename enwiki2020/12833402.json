    "text": "Formate dehydrogenases are a set of enzymes that catalyse the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide, donating the electrons to a second substrate, such as NAD+ in formate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.1.2) or to a cytochrome in formate:ferricytochrome-b1 oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.2.1). == Function == NAD- dependent formate dehydrogenases are important in methylotrophic yeast and bacteria and are vital in the catabolism of C1 compounds such as methanol. The cytochrome-dependent enzymes are more important in anaerobic metabolism in prokaryotes. For example, in E. coli, the formate:ferricytochrome-b1 oxidoreductase is an intrinsic membrane protein with two subunits and is involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration. NAD-dependent reaction Formate + NAD+ CO2 \\+ NADH + H+ Cytochrome-dependent reaction Formate + 2 ferricytochrome b1 CO2 \\+ 2 ferrocytochrome b1 + 2 H+ == Molybdopterin, molybdenum and selenium dependence == One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family that sometimes employ tungsten (bacterial formate dehydrogenase H) is known to use a selenium-molybdenum version of molybdopterin. ==Transmembrane domain== The transmembrane domain of the beta subunit of formate dehydrogenase consists of a single transmembrane helix. This domain acts as a transmembrane anchor, allowing the conduction of electrons within the protein. == See also == *Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome) *Formate dehydrogenase (cytochrome-c-553) *Formate dehydrogenase (NADP+) *Microbial metabolism == References == == External links == *ENZYME link for EC 1.2.2.1 *ENZYME link for EC 1.2.1.2 Category:Cellular respiration Category:Metabolism Category:EC 1.2.2 Category:EC 1.2.1 ",
