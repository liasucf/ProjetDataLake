The album was recorded and produced by vocalist and lead guitarist Faraz Anwar. The album is the second album produced by Faraz. The album is entirely a progressive rock and heavy metal album and the first concept album which is released in Pakistan. Maazi, Haal, Mustaqbil was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Five singles have been released in promotion of the album along with their music videos; \"Meri Terhan\" and \"Insaan\" in 2002, \"Izhar\" in March 2003, \"Kitne Sadian\" in April 2004 and \"Panchi\" in September 2005. \"Kitne Sadian\", \"Insaan\" and \"Meri Terhan\" did very well at the local music charts. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album sold more than 30,000 copies upon its release and is the band's highest selling album. == Background == After Akhthar Qayyum left the band, Faraz Anwar recruited two new members Jamal Mustafa on rhythm guitars and Irfan Ahmed on drums. The band then started working on their second studio album. Firstly, the band struggled to strike a record deal as no record label was willing to release a progressive rock album as the general Pakistani audience were not aware of the genre. Leaving aside the record labels, the band also faced opposition from the local music channels as they banned the band from playing their music videos which were initially given a lot of air time. Music videos of singles \"Insaan\", released in October 2002, and \"Meri Terhan\", released in December, were banned from playing on many local music channels. However, the band did not gave up and went on recording and releasing their third single music video, \"Izhar\", for the 2003 Cricket World Cup and dedicated the song to the Pakistan cricket team. The video of the song was made in a very short period of time and was released in March 2003. The video was a success and received a lot of air time play on music channels and was even played internationally on the Dubai based sports channel Ten Sports. After the release of \"Izhar\", Khalid Khan also left the band due to playing bass for two bands at one time, Mizraab and Aaroh. Aaroh had already broken into the mainstream and Mizraab was not going to remain underground much longer. Realising that it was difficult for him to continue with both these demanding acts, the band decided that Khalid should limit himself to one of these. So, Khalid ended up parting ways with the band and became a full-time band member of Aaroh. Faraz Arshad, an ex-student of Faraz Awar, replaced Khalid Khan on bass guitars. == Reception == On April 14, 2004, Mizraab released their fourth single \"Kitni Sadian\" music video directed by Babar Sheikh from their upcoming second studio album.
