It appears documented in an inscription at Delphi that records a border conflict among Peuma, Melitaea. Peuma is also cited as having a border dispute with Phyliadon also settled by neutral arbitration. Peuma minted bronze coins that have been preserved which have been dated with the inscription \u00ab\u03a0\u0395\u03a5\u039c\u0391\u03a4\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u00bb.
