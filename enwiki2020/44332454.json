    "text": "Renforth, referred to during planning as Renforth Gateway, is a bus station on the border of the cities of Mississauga and Toronto, in Ontario, Canada. Located at Eglinton Avenue and Commerce Boulevard, it is the eastern terminus of the Mississauga Transitway and is close to the interchange between Highway 401 and Highway 427. Service consists of bus rapid transit on the Mississauga Transitway, local MiWay and Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus routes, GO Transit express routes on the Highway 401/Highway 407 corridor and an express connection to Kipling subway station via Highway 427. ==Planning and construction== The Renforth site was identified by Metrolinx in 2012 as a transportation mobility hub, which would integrate bus rapid transit and local bus service. Construction of the station began in 2014. A parcel of land formerly owned by the City of Toronto government, and used as a TTC bus loop, was incorporated into the site. ==Bus routes== ===GO Transit=== *19 Mississauga/North York *40 Hamilton/Richmond Hill Pearson Express ===MiWay=== *7 Airport *24 Northwest *35/35A Eglinton (board on curbside stops outside station) *39 Britannia *43 Matheson\u2013Argentia *57 Courtneypark *74 Explorer *87 Meadowvale\u2013Skymark *100 Airport Express *107 Malton Express *109 Meadowvale Express ===TTC=== *32A Eglinton West *112B/C West Mall ==Future development== Land has been preserved for future dedicated bus lanes to Toronto Pearson International Airport and a future extension of Line 5 Eglinton. ==References== ==External links== *Progress at Renforth Gateway - Mississauga Transitway * * Category:Mississauga Transitway Category:GO Transit bus terminals ",
