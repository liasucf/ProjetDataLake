Son of Francisco dos Santos and Maria Benedita de Lima Santos, he lived his childhood at the Coruputuba farm. He has shown interest in music since he was a child. When he turned six, her older sister, Fia, gave her a Beatles record, a simple compact, and he immediately began to sing along with a cousin. One day, in the farm hen, he made a battery of paint cans, broomstick mics, wooden guitars with strings of thin wire, and the puleiro made a grandstand and also a flap. In the 1980s, Dunga had many problems with drugs and drinks. But at the age of eighteen he returned to the Catholic Church and married. He grew professionally, becoming a professional mechanic. He was an animator of a prayer group, and at that time already married to Edin\u00e9ia, he had his first son, Felipe. Today, the couple has two more daughters: Priscila and Ana Carolina. He received an invitation to live in Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova in 1991, beginning his career as a missionary of the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Community, where he gained a great deal of focus on dealing with youth, especially with the movement PHN (Por Hoje N\u00e3o Vou Mais Pecar). According to the singer himself, the PHN arose from the experience acquired by him in the visits to prison, Casa Foundation, houses to support the HIV virus, in addition to his own life history.
