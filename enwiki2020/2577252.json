    "text": "P\u00e1l D\u00e1rdai (born 16 March 1976) is a Hungarian retired footballer who played mainly as a defensive midfielder, and former coach of German Hertha BSC. In a 20-year professional career, he played for over a decade with the same club, Hertha BSC, in Germany. With 286 Bundesliga appearances, he is the club's most capped player. D\u00e1rdai gained 61 caps for the Hungary national team in 12 years, and also worked as the country's manager. ==Playing career== ===Club=== ====Hungary==== Born in P\u00e9cs, D\u00e1rdai began his professional career with local P\u00e9csi Mecsek FC, moving in January 1996 to Budapesti VSC. He helped his new club finish second in both the league and cup. ====Hertha BSC==== D\u00e1rdai playing for Hertha in 2009 In January 1997, D\u00e1rdai signed with Germany's Hertha BSC, appearing in ten matches for the 2. Bundesliga side before the end of the season, as the club was promoted to the top-flight Bundesliga. In 1998\u201399, he made 21 appearances (6 as a starter) as Hertha finished in third place, behind second-placed Bayer Leverkusen by one point. On 13 November 2008, D\u00e1rdai marked his 250th Bundesliga appearance during the 1\u20130 win against 1899 Hoffenheim. Following the match, he thanked \"the team and the fans\". On 16 January 2009, D\u00e1rdai damaged his meniscus during training. He was operated on by Gert Schleicher after returning to Berlin from Marbella in Spain, where Hertha spent their winter training camp. Hertha extended D\u00e1rdai's contract by one year on 28 May 2009, and he became the club's longest-serving player. He expressed his wish to further extend his link, stating, \"I can imagine that I will end my career here in Berlin, but before I return to Hungary I want to fulfil my ambition and that is to win the championship and the cup.\" Dieter Hoene\u00df responded by saying the club would also like to keep him. D\u00e1rdai helped The Old Lady qualify several times for the UEFA Cup, appearing sparingly from 2004 to 2006 (33 total matches) but featuring heavily in the following years. From 2009, his appearances became less and less frequent: after only one match in the 2010\u201311 campaign \u2013 with eventually returning to the top level \u2013 and being demoted to the reserve team, the 35-year-old retired from football, having appeared in 297 league contests. ===International=== D\u00e1rdai began playing for Hungary with the under-21s, in 1996. He made his senior debut in a friendly against Slovenia on 19 August 1998, and scored his first international goal on 10 October in an UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Azerbaijan, in the 58th minute of a 4\u20130 triumph. Often cast as starting central midfielder alongside Kriszti\u00e1n Lisztes, under managers Bertalan Bicskei and Imre Gellei, D\u00e1rdai captained the national side seven times in 2006, netting twice. On 15 November 2006, he was not included in P\u00e9ter V\u00e1rhidi's provisional 25-man squad for the Euro 2008 qualifying phase, but featured in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign as Hungary was now managed by Erwin Koeman. ==Managerial career== ===2012\u20132019: Hertha BSC=== ====Early career==== In 2012, D\u00e1rdai began working as a coach at Hertha BSC, his assistants at the under-15 team being Admir Ham\u017eagi\u0107 and Jochem Ziegert. ===2014\u201315: Hungary=== On 18 September 2014, D\u00e1rdai was appointed as interim manager of the Hungary national team. He turned down an offer from the Hungarian Football Federation (\"MLSZ\") to manage the side on a permanent basis, with the former's president S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi confirming the latter would be in charge of three Euro 2016 qualifying matches for free. On 23 September 2014, Zsolt L\u0151w, assistant coach of Red Bull Salzburg, was not permitted by his club to join D\u00e1rdai's coaching staff in the same capacity. The latter's debut took place on 11 October against Romania, a 1\u20131 draw in Bucharest. Three days later, he managed his first win, prevailing 1\u20130 away against the Faroe Islands; he said after the second match that \"the minimum aims were to get the three points\". Former international Istv\u00e1n Sall\u00f3i said in an interview with Nemzeti Sport in October 2014 that, \"D\u00e1rdai is the only chance for Hungarian football.\" The former was appointed by the latter as the aid to map the opponents of the national team, and also said, \"In the last ten days it became incredible clear what type of work I have to do.\" On 14 November 2014, Hungary won their first home match under D\u00e1rdai by beating Finland 1\u20130 thanks to Zolt\u00e1n Gera's 84th-minute goal in the Euro 2016 qualifier at the Groupama Arena in Budapest. The following month, the MLSZ announced D\u00e1rdai would remain as manager until 30 November 2015, and he admitted that his son influenced him in making the decision by saying, \"You have to return because without you they are not going to win.\" After returning to Hertha BSC, D\u00e1rdai was replaced as Hungary manager by his former mentor, Bernd Storck. In November 2015, Hungary under Storck qualified for the UEFA European Championship after a 44-year absence, and D\u00e1rdai stated in an interview with Hertha's official website that he built the base of the team while his successor added his part to reach the finals. ===Return to Hertha=== On 5 February 2015, he was appointed interim manager of the main squad. His first match in charge was a 2\u20130 victory over Mainz 05 two days later. On 29 May 2015, D\u00e1rdai signed a permanent contract with Hertha. Hertha began the season by getting eliminated from the UEFA Europa League in the third qualifying round by Br\u00f8ndby. Hertha won the first leg 1\u20130 and lost the second leg 3\u20131. On 16 April during the 2018\u201319 Bundesliga season, it was announced D\u00e1rdai would be leaving his role at the end of the season and would return to a youth coach role in 2020. ==Personal life== D\u00e1rdai is married and has three sons: Palk\u00f3, M\u00e1rton and Bence. On 20 July 2002, Bal\u00e1zs D\u00e1rdai, his brother and a midfielder for FC Barcs, died during a tournament after an artery burst when he jumped for a ball. Their father, also named P\u00e1l (1951\u20132017) and the club's coach, was watching the game when it happened; Bal\u00e1zs was only 23 years old. ==Statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
