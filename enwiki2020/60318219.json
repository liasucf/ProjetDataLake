    "text": "Roopu or R\u014dp\u016b is a M\u0101ori word for an organisation, group, or collective. The term is widely used throughout New Zealand as part of the name of organisations, especially those which have a strong connection with the New Zealand M\u0101ori population. In organisational names, it is usually prefixed with the word Te (\"The\"). Traditionally, the word is spelt roopu, but modern linguistics favours the use of a macron over a single vowel to indicate a longher sound, rather than a double letter. The word is likely to be a Maorified form of the English word \"group\". Notable organisations within New Zealand which use Roopu or R\u014dp\u016b as part of their names include: *Te Roopu Huihuinga Hauora (a major M\u0101ori healthcare organisation) *New Zealand Association of Counsellors / Te Roopu Kaiwhiriwhiri o Aotearoa *Te Roop\u016b M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori students' association of the University of Otago) *Te Roopu Pounamu (the M\u0101ori network of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand) *Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa (the national M\u0101ori weavers' collective) *Te Roopu Rawakore (the National Unemployed and Beneficiaries Movement) *New Zealand Law Students' Association Te Roopu Tauira Ture o Aotearoa *Te R\u014dp\u016b o te Ora / Women's Health League *Te Ropu Wahine Maori Toko i te Ora (M\u0101ori Women's Welfare League) *The Waitangi Tribunal/Te R\u014dp\u016b Whakamana i te Tiriti Category:M\u0101ori words and phrases Category:M\u0101ori culture ",
