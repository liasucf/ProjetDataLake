In 1872, it became the Associated Blacksmiths of Scotland, but then decided to organise throughout the UK, in 1885 becoming the Associated Blacksmiths' Society. Around 1910s, it became the Associated Blacksmiths and Iron Workers' Society.John B. Smethurst and Peter Carter, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.6, pp.314-320 Membership was around 3,000 for many years, but grew rapidly under the leadership of John Thomson in the 1910s. He focused on mergers with smaller unions, bringing in the Combined Smiths of Great Britain and Ireland, the Co- operative Society of Smiths, the National United Society of Smiths and Hammermen, and the United Smiths Trade Union of Ireland.\"Obituary: Mr J. Thomson, OBE, JP\", Annual Report of the 1919 Trades Union Congress, p.205 This brought membership up to 13,500 by 1915, and made it the largest union of blacksmiths in the country, ahead of the Amalgamated Society of Smiths and Strikers. In 1963, the union merged with the Shipconstructors' and Shipwrights' Association into the United Society of Boilermakers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers, which renamed itself as the \"Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers\". ==Election results== The union sponsored a Labour Party candidate in 1929. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
