    "text": "France Telecom SA v Commission (2009) C-202/07 is a European competition law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications. ==Facts== Wanadoo Interactive was part of France Telecom SA after a merger. The Commission found it to have set predatory prices \u2018as part of a plan to pre- empt the market in high-speed internet access during a key phase in its development\u2019. France Telecom argued that such a charge should only succeed if proven that the predator is capable of recouping the losses it incurs during its campaign. The Advocate General's Opinion was sympathetic to recoupment argument. ==Judgment== The CJEU held that there is no requirement to prove that recouping losses is possible, and so there was abuse of a dominant position. ==See also== *United Kingdom enterprise law *EU law ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom enterprise case law ",
