The resolution marked the 28th extension of MINURSO's mandate. ==Resolution== ===Observations=== The Security Council reaffirmed the need for a durable and mutual solution to the Western Sahara problem, which would provide for the self-determination of the people of the territory. Both Morocco, the Polisario Front and regional states were urged to co-operate with the United Nations to end the political impasse and reach a solution to the long-running dispute. The Council noted the release of 404 Moroccan prisoners of war in accordance with international humanitarian law while it, along with Morocco, had to co- operate with the International Committee of the Red Cross to determine the fate of persons missing since the start of the conflict. The appointment of Peter van Walsum as Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara was welcomed. ===Acts=== All parties were called upon to respect military agreements reached with MINURSO. Member States were called upon to consider contributing towards confidence-building measures to facilitate greater person-to-person contact, such as family visits. The mandate of MINURSO was extended and the Secretary-General Kofi Annan instructed to report on the situation in Western Sahara and for the Personal Envoy to provide a briefing within three months on progress made in the territory. ==See also== * Baker Plan * Free Zone (region) * Legal status of Western Sahara * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1601 to 1700 (2005\u20132006) * Moroccan Wall * Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1634 1634 1634 Category:2005 in Western Sahara Category:2005 in Morocco Category:October 2005 events ",
