    "text": "Gordon A. Sheehan (born Gordon Augustine Holland May 11, 1910 \u2013 September 6, 1996), was an American animator and cartoonist. He spent the early part of his career at Fleischer Studios animating notable features such as Betty Boop, Popeye, Superman, and Gulliver's Travels, among other works. == Early Life == Born in Mechanicville, New York, he was the seventh of eight children of Patrick and Anna (Hammond) Holland, who were Irish immigrants from county Limerick. After the death of his mother at the age of five, he went to live with a family by the name of Sheehan, whose surname he assumed, although, he was never legally adopted by them. == Education == Sheehan was a 1928 graduate of Mechanicville High School, and received his artistic education at Pratt Institute, graduating in 1932. == Career == Sheehan began his career at Fleischer Studio in 1933, eventually joining Willard Bowsky\u2019s unit in 1936, where he worked animating features such as Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman. Sheehan formed his own studio in 1944 that largely produced animated governmental and educational films, along with cartoons inspired by the work of Rube Goldberg. Later he was the head of animation at Sound Masters, Inc. and Coronet Films. After his retirement, Sheehan was an animation professor at Columbia College Chicago, where he taught and inspired notable animator Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky recalled, \u201cmy first [animation] teacher was Gordon Sheehan, he was 90 years old. He was an old Popeye animator, and he was about this high. And I fell in love. I knew that I couldn\u2019t [not] do this for a living, cause he still drew, like, that old Fleischer style in circles, and he was amazing and very inspiring, and I realized I couldn\u2019t not do it.\u201d Sheehan received a lifetime achievement award from the International Animation Association (Midwest Chapter) and the Official Popeye Fan Club. == References == Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Mechanicville, New York Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:Fleischer Studios people Category:American people of Irish descent Category:20th-century American artists Category:Animators from New York (state) Category:American cartoonists Category:Columbia College Chicago faculty ",
