They collaborated through their entire careers, and most of their published work is attributed to both. ==Life and Family== The Chichagova sisters were part of a well-known family dynasty of Moscow architects. Their father, , designed the historic Moscow City Hall building on Red Square, among others, and their paternal grandfather, , designed the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. Both sisters studied in the Stroganov Arts Academy (currently called the Stroganov Moscow State Academy of Arts and Industry) from 1911 to 1917. In 1920, they continued their education in the famous Higher Art and Technical Studios Vkhutemas, which was home to a number of well-known artists in the Constructivist school. They themselves identified as Constructivists, and their book art strongly reflects this aesthetic. ==Works== Cover of \"\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0438\" (\"Charlie's Travels,\" 1924), illustrated by Olga and Galina Chichagova.

Their subject is interpreted on the large scale of > the entire production, not focusing too closely on the details, and without > going into particular details. Hence the style of these books and drawings: > they are very clever schemes of the branches of civilization. (From a 1926 > Russian periodical on recent children's books, as cited in the memoirs of > Nina Simonovich-Efimova.) Later critics have also noted Chichagovas's celebration of industrial objects, even at the expense of figures recognizable in the popular culture of the time: for example, in Charlie's Travels, rather than take advantage of the beloved and easily recognizable figure of Charlie Chaplin, they instead chose to foreground his various means of transportation. These later critics have also identified a change in the Chichagova's style: > Returning again to their beloved theme of transportation in the 1929 albom > Let's Go (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c), the artists avoid their previous schematicism: > machines become three-dimensional, and the people sitting in them cease to > be mere symbols; the illustrators are interested not only in the general > outlines of objects, but also in the details of their construction. == References == Category:Sibling artists Category:Russian illustrators Category:Russian women illustrators Category:Russian children's book illustrators Category:Russian women artists Category:1891 births Category:1886 births Category:1966 deaths Category:1958 deaths ",
