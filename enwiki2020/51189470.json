    "text": "DFS-Kopernikus 3 (or Deutscher Fernmelde Satellit-3 and HellasSat 1) was a communications satellite operated by Deutsche Telekom. == Satellite == The DFS-Kopernikus series of satellites debuted in 1989 with the third being launched in 1992. Ordered in 1983 and produced by the GESAT consortium of MBB (flight segment prime contractor), Siemens (overall prime contractor), ANT Nachrichtentechnik (payload), Standard Elektrik Lorenz (digital switching equipment), and Dornier Systems (ground control system), DFS spacecraft are smaller than TV-Sat: on-station mass of DFS is 850 kg with a 15.4 m solar array span providing up to 1.5 kW of electrical power. The satellite also used a propulsion system S400. The communications payload includes ten 14/11-12 GHz transponders with five spares and one experimental 30/20 GHz transponder with one spare. At the end of 1994, DFS 1-3 were stationed at 33.5\u00b0 East, 28.5\u00b0 East, and 23.5\u00b0 East, respectively. Like TV-Sat, the DFS Kopernikus series has been concluded. DFS 3 was leased to the Greek company Hellas Sat in 2002 as a stop-gap measure. It was retired in February 2003. == Launch == DFS-Kopernikus 3 was launched by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, United States, at 09:47 UTC on 12 October 1992. == See also == * 1992 in spaceflight == References == == External links == * Category:Spacecraft launched in 1992 Category:Communications satellites ",
