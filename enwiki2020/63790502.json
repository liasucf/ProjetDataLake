She took office as a Member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature in March 2019. Gomba is a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and previously served as a municipal councillor of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. ==Early political career== Gomba joined the ANC and started her political career as a municipal councillor of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. During her tenure on the council, she was one of the longest-serving councillors. She and many other councillors were charged in relation to the scandal around Nelson Mandela's funeral. The charge was later withdrawn in early May 2019. ==Eastern Cape provincial government== On 19 March 2019, she was sworn in as a Member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature, succeeding Thandiswa Marawu. She was elected to her first full term in May 2019. She was sworn in on 22 May. Premier Oscar Mabuyane appointed her to his Executive Council as the MEC for Health. She assumed the office on 29 May. ===Coronavirus pandemic=== In April 2020, national health minister Zweli Mkhize expressed his frustration with Gomba's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nelson Mandela Bay. The regional African National Congress Youth League called for her removal, while premier Mabuyane defended her. On 28 April 2020, Gomba, while in a Zoom meeting with minister Mkhize and her provincial counterparts, uttered: \"andidikwe\" (meaning \"I am fed up\"). Her comment generated controversy and she subsequently apologised, citing that she was misunderstood. ==References== ==External links== *Sindiswa Griselda Gomba \u2013 People's Assembly Category:Living people Category:1958 births Category:Xhosa people Category:People from the Eastern Cape Category:Members of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature Category:Women members of provincial legislatures of South Africa Category:South African women in politics Category:21st-century South African politicians Category:21st-century South African women politicians ",
