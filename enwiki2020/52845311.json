H\u00e9roux was born in Pointe-du-LacCanada East Census 1851 (Recensement - Canada Est, district de recensement No 2) in Lower Canada and baptized in nearby Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.Parish Registers, Immacul\u00e9e- Conception, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec. The claim that he was Iroquois is contradicted by the documentary evidence. At the age of 20, he was caught trespassing at a building on a wharf. His original punishment was commuted on the condition he seek employment outside Lower Canada. He was hired by the Hudson's Bay Company in the spring of 1833 and sent to several interior posts. In 1837 he was reappointed to Fort Vancouver, where he met and had at least one child with a Chinookan woman. From here he would serve intermittently at Fort Vancouver, Fort Taku, and finally Fort Stikine, arriving at the final station in 1841. Fort Stikine was located within the Stikine lisi\u00e8re, a territory of Russian America leased to the HBC by the Russian-American Company. Among his other duties he may have served as interpreter. During his time at Fort Stikine, he was caught stealing alcohol by William Glen Rae and later became embroiled in disputes with John McLoughlin, Jr. These poor relations erupted into a confrontation that ended with John Jr.'s death on 21 April 1842. George Simpson, on a general inspection of the Columbia Department, arrived five days after the killing. After a short investigation he considered H\u00e9roux justified, and sent him to Novoarkhangelsk rather than be tried in a court in the Province of Canada or the United Kingdom. Several other men later testified that John Jr. was prone to alcoholism and apparently had tried to kill H\u00e9roux. H\u00e9roux was released in 1843 by Chief Manager of Russian America Arvid Adolf Ethol\u00e9n due to Russian disinterest in the case. He was transported by the Cadboro and later the Beaver to Fort Victoria and Fort Vancouver. From there he went over the York Factory Express to Norway House. In 1846, legal authorities in Canada concluded that the expense to ship H\u00e9roux and all witnesses to the United Kingdom would be too exorbitant and instead closed the case. Simpson's official disinterest in the matter aroused great hostility in his subordinate, Chief Factor John McLoughlin, the father of the victim, and contributed to his eventual retirement from the company. H\u00e9roux returned to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and died there in 1853. ==Citations== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Canadian fur traders Category:French Quebecers Category:1811 births Category:Hudson's Bay Company people Category:Oregon pioneers Category:1853 deaths ",
