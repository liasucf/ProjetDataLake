Frederic John Shore of the Bengal Civil Service, and granddaughter of John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth, and writer on needlework. Educated at Charterhouse School from 1865 until 1869, he served for seven years in the Indian telegraph service, stationed on the coast of the Persian Gulf. On a long leave, in January 1876, Floyer started for the unexplored interior of what is now Sistan and Baluchestan Province, in Iran.

In January 1878 he was appointed inspector-general of Egyptian telegraphs, a post which he held for the rest of his life. He turned round the finances of the department, and induced the government to devote a part of its surplus to experiments on the cultivation of trees and plants in the desert. He cultivated successfully cactus for fibre, casuarina for telegraph poles, Hyoscyamus muticus yielding the alkaloid hyoscyamine, and other plants. Having discovered sodium nitrate in a clay in Upper Egypt, he was appointed by the government to superintend the process of its extraction.
