As elsewhere, the forerunner of Estonian Guiding was the Scout movement, and the first Guide units came into being as part of Scout units. The first independent district was formed in Tallinn in March 1920. In 1921, independent districts were formed in Tartu and Valga. It was banned in 1940 after the Soviet occupation of Estonia. The organization Estonian Girl Guides in Exile was established in the autumn of 1949, and a change of statutes and name occurred in 1960.
