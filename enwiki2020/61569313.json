For instance, the postwar concurrence with Neo- Confucianism canonized the Chinese Philosophy in Taiwan, contra the Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China, may somehow omit the complexity of Taiwanese Philosophy. With the unearthing literature and sprouting discourses due to the merits of democratization, public debates on whether historical configuration of Taiwanese Philosophy or many faces of Taiwanese philosophers, have unveiled the world intellectualism of Taiwanese Philosophy via Japan in the Golden 1920s and later substituted with the postwar Chinese Confucian Canons. Nevertheless, a reinvigorated formulation on Taiwanese Philosophy that China and Japan at different times imprint as exogenesis; and thus, a burgeoning philosophical development with the Taiwanese Gemeinschaft. \u3008\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99\u610f\u8b58\u578b\u614b\u2014\u8a66\u8ad6\u65e5\u672c\u6b96\u6c11\u7d71\u6cbb\u4e0b\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u65cf\u904b\u52d5\u300c\u6c11\u65cf\u6587\u5316\u300d\u8ad6\u8ff0\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff081919-1937\uff09\u3009 ==The History of Taiwanese Philosophy== The History of Taiwanese Philosophy is linked with Taiwanese History: the 1895 Sino-Japanese War is not only a turning point for East-Asian Realpolitik scenarios, but also a cornerstone for the East-Asian philosophy. Taiwan, as a fragment of empires, broods its philosophical significance by absorbing quintessential from the liminal neighbors such as Japan, China. Taiwanese Philosophy embarks with Lin Mosei\u2019s 1916 publication, \u2018Wang Yang- ming\u2019s Liangzhi\u2019(\u738b\u967d\u660e\u306e\u826f\u77e5\u8aaa), on East Asian Studies by Tokyo Imperial University; and overall, it chronicalized with the early sprouting from Aborigines and Ming-Qing Han settlements; the pre-enlightenment, the enlightenment, the golden times during the Japanese colonial rules; the postwar and White Terror suppression; and blossomy systemic studies since the democratization. === Aborigines=== Literature on the Taiwanese Aboriginal Philosophy is scarce that only through colloquial myths and legends can it be studied. Some other studies on the knowledge system of the Taiwanese Aborigines are an attempt to reformulate a normative principle on Taiwanese Philosophy. === Ming and Qing Periods === During the Ming and Qing imperial times, the Han Chinese settlement in Taiwan came into a broad mass; the Confucianism was also imported through Han private schools and temples. Canonical Confucianism lecture scripts, on I-ching in particular, were ostensible, however, lost hereinafter. The understanding on Confucianism at that time was more likely to philology, rather than philosophy.

Taiwan, as a fragment of/f empires, on one hand influenced from the modernization movements neighbor China (May Fourth Movement), Japan (Taisho Democracy), Russia (October Revolution), and Korean Independence Movement; one the other through abroad scholarship in China, Japan, and even the United States inherited from Christian Theology, German Idealism, Dialectical Materialism, and American Pragmatism, and Heideggerian thoughtsystem via the Kyoto School. Taiwanese Philosophy was thought a part of Japanese colonial modern heritage but sui generis brood from the civil society against the imperial dominance.

Taiwanese intellectuals who endeavored under the modernization education were multi-cultural and -lingual, from Taiwanese, Japanese, English, and even French and German.
