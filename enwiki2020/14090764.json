    "text": "Zambia is officially a \"Christian country\" by constitution. Christianity is the state religion in Zambia according to the 1996 constitution, and the vast majority of Zambians i.e 85.5% are Christians of various denominations, but many other religious traditions are present. Traditional religious thought blends easily with Christian beliefs in many of the country's syncretic churches. Other religions include the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Judaism. Ismaili Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities exist owing to the Indian and Pakistani diasporic community. In 2010, according to World Christian Trends, 85.5% of the population identified as Christian, 11.2% identified with indigenous religions, 1.8% identified as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, 1.1% identified as Muslim, 0.2% identified as agnostic, 0.1% identified as Hindu, and all other groups accounted for less than 0.1%. The 2010 Zambian census found that 75.3% of Zambians were Protestant, 20.2% were Catholic, 0.5% were Muslim, 2.0% followed other religions, and 1.8% had no religion. ==Background== {| style=\"clear:right; float:right; background:#ffffff; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;\" class=\"toccolours\" width=\"220\" font-size : \"90%\" |+ Religious distribution (2010) |- |style=\"text- align:center;background:#A8BDEC\"|Religion||style=\"text- align:center;background:#A8BDEC\"| % of total population |- |Protestant|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 77.3 |- |Catholic|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 19.2 |- |Islam|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0.0 |- |Other|| style=\"text- align:center;\" | 14.0 |- |None|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9.8 |} Zambia got independence in 1964 from the British Empire. Post independence, Pentecostal and Charismatic missionaries from the United States were met with a wide audience in the 1970s. The growth of the religion suffered during the 80s and 90s on account of increased economic turmoil. After Frederick Chiluba (a Pentecostal Christian) became President in 1991, Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country. While the initial constitution did not specify religion, the amendment in 1996 declared the nation as \"a Christian nation while upholding the right of every person to enjoy the person's freedom of conscience and religion\". As per the Article 1 of the constitution, the nation is a Sovereign Secular Republic and as per Article 25, citizens free to express thoughts and practice any religion. == Christianity == Portrait of David Livingstone Christianity is believed to have arrived in Zambia in the form of European Protestant missionaries and African explorers during the mid of 19th century. David Livingstone was a Scottish missionary who did pioneering missionary work that brought the attention of Africa to the Western world. Livingstone inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers and missionaries. He led the way in Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and health care for Africans. Many African chiefs and tribes held him in high esteem and it was one of the major reasons for facilitating relations between them and the British. Zambia is officially a Christian nation according to the 1996 constitution, but a wide variety of religious traditions exist. Traditional religious thought blends easily with Christian beliefs in many of the country's syncretic churches. Christian denominations include: Presbyterianism, Roman Catholic, Anglican, Pentecostal, New Apostolic Church, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Branhamism, and a variety of Evangelical denominations. These grew, adjusted and prospered from the original missionary settlements (Portuguese and Catholicism in the east from Mozambique) and Anglicanism (English and Scottish influences) from the south. Except for some technical positions (e.g. physicians), western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers. Zambia has the one of the largest communities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Africa with close to 250,000 members, second only to Nigeria. == Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith == In 2010, Zambia was estimated as having the eighth highest population of followers of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, with 241,100, representing 1.80% of the population, placing it at fourth overall in that measure. The William Mmutle Masetlha Foundation, an organization founded in 1995 and run by the Zambian Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community, is particularly active in areas such as literacy and primary health care. The Maseltha Institute, its parent organization, was founded earlier in 1983. == Islam & Hinduism== Hindu temple and Mosque in Lusaka Province. Islam arrived in Zambia in the form of Arab slave traders during the mid of 18th century. Other Muslims and people from Hindu community arrived to Zambia during British Colonial rule. Approximately 1% of Zambians are Muslim, mostly living in urban areas. The vast majority of Muslims in Zambia are Sunni. An Ismaili Shia community is also present. About 500 people in Zambia belong to the Ahmadiyya sect of Islam. == Others == There is also a small Jewish community, composed mostly of Ashkenazis. Notable Jewish Zambians have included Simon Zukas, retired Minister, MP and a member of Forum for Democracy and Development and earlier the MMD and United National Independence Party. Additionally, the economist Stanley Fischer, currently the governor of the Bank of Israel and formerly head of the IMF was born and partially raised in Zambia's Jewish community. Notable sects, such as the Alice Lenshina led Lumpa Church and the newly established Last Church of Order also exist. ==See also== *Church of the Province of Central Africa (Anglican) *Roman Catholicism in Zambia *Council of Churches in Zambia *Demographics of Zambia *Religion in Africa ==References== Category:Zambian society Category:Zambian culture ",
