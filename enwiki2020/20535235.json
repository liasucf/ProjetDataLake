Its location is uncertain, but is believed to be near the classical settlement of Comana in Cappadocia.\"Kummanni.\" Reallexikon der Assyriologie. Recent research make a location in Plain Cilicia more likely, presumably at Sirkeli H\u00f6y\u00fck 'Forlanini, M. 2013: How to infer Ancient Roads and Intineraries from heterogenous Hittite Texts: The Case of the Cilician (Kizzuwatnean) Road System, KASKAL 10, 1\u201334. Kummanni was the major cult center of the Hurrian chief deity, Te\u0161up. Its Hurrian name Kummeni simply translates as \"The Shrine.\" The city persisted into the Early Iron Age, and appears as Kisuatni in Assyrian records. It was located in the east of Que, the successor of Kizzuwatna. The town should not be confused with Kumme, a holy city for Assyrians and Urarteans, located in the highlands between Assyria and Urartu. ==References== *Ernest Ren\u00e9 Lacheman, Martha A.
