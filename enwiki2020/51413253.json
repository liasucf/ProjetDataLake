    "text": "The Revolutionary Love Project is a grass roots organization in the United States aimed at reclaiming love as a force for justice, founded by Valarie Kaur. The project is based at the University of Southern California. Revolutionary love is defined as the choice to enter into labor for others, for our opponents, and for ourselves in order to transform the world around us. It is not a formal code or prescription but an orientation to life that is personal and political, rooted in joy. == Founding == === Philosophy === Interfaith leader Valarie Kaur declared at the 2015 Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions, \u201cRevolutionary Love is the call of our times.\u201d The movement is rising to the needs of the moment and aims to make love a public ethic in American life. Founder Valarie Kaur and other team members are establishing \u201crevolutionary love\u201d as a philosophy with a strong intellectual foundation and a set of practices accessible to people of all faiths and backgrounds. \u201cRevolutionary Love\u201d is defined as, \u201cthe kind of love that drives courageous action in our lives and in our politics.\u201d The movement draws from different traditions and histories, and attracts different faiths, humanists, and secularists to respond to escalating political and public hate, polarization, and social division. === Structure and Organization === The Revolutionary Love\u00ae Project team currently consists of 15 Fellows and 200 Ambassadors. It is also connected to a larger movement of local communities, thought leaders and organizational partners, such as the We Stand With Love Campaign, the Together Tour, Love\u2010Driven Politics, and Groundswell Movement of 250K members. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Love ",
