    "text": "Francis Marion Campbell (May 25, 1929 \u2013 July 13, 2016) was an American football defensive lineman and coach. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs from 1949 until 1951, where he was appropriately nicknamed \"Swamp Fox\" because of his first and middle names. During his National Football League (NFL) playing career, he played for the San Francisco 49ers (1954\u20131955) and the Philadelphia Eagles (1956\u20131961), winning Pro Bowl honors in 1959 and 1960 and also being named 1st team All-Pro in 1960 as part of the Eagles' championship team that year. He was one of the last of the NFL's \"two- way\" players who played all offensive and defensive snaps in a game. ==Coaching career== ===NFL=== Campbell was head coach of the Atlanta Falcons (twice) and Philadelphia Eagles as well as the defensive coordinator for each team separate from his times as head coach. He also served as defensive line coach for the Boston Patriots (1962\u20131963), Minnesota Vikings (1964\u20131966), and the Los Angeles Rams (1967\u20131968). He was an expert in the 3\u20134 defense; his Eagles defenses ranked first in the league in points allowed in 1980 and 1981, and second and first in yards allowed. At 46 games under .500, Campbell's 34\u201380\u20131 head coaching record is the fifth lowest winning percentage among head coaches who have coached at least five seasons in the NFL. The only coaches with worse winning percentages are Phil Handler, Bert Bell, Carl Storck, and David Shula. ===Georgia=== Campbell spent the 1994 season as the defensive coordinator for his alma mater Georgia Bulldogs. ==Head coaching record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular Season |- !Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish |- !ATL||1974 ||1||5||0||.167|| 4th in NFC West |- !ATL||1975 ||4||10||0||.286|| 3rd in NFC West |- !ATL||1976 ||1||4||0||.200|| 3rd in NFC West |- !PHI||1983 ||5||11||0||.313|| 4th in NFC East |- !PHI||1984 ||6||9||1||.400|| 5th in NFC East |- !PHI||1985 ||6||9||0||.400|| 4th in NFC East |- !ATL||1987 ||3||12||0||.200|| 4th in NFC West |- !ATL||1988 ||5||11||0||.313|| 4th in NFC West |- !ATL||1989 ||3||9||0||.250|| 4th in NFC West |- ! colspan=\"2\"|TotalMarion Campbell Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks \u2013 Pro-Football- Reference.com||34||80||1||.300|| |- |} ==Personal life== Campbell spent two years in the United States Army between college and the NFL.
