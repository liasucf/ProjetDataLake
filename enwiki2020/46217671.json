Co- publishing partners include David Zwirner Gallery, Harvard Peabody Museum Press, Temple University Press, Art Institute of Chicago, and Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. == History == Radius Books was established in 2007 by David Chickey, publisher, editor, and book designer; Darius Himes, editor; David Skolkin, production; and Joanna Hurley, marketing and public relations. The impetus to found a non-profit publisher arose, in part, from the issue of library budget cuts in the early 2000s, which adversely affected the sales of art books. == Donation Program == Radius Books donates copies of every book published to school, public and university libraries, and arts organizations across the United States. Currently, Radius serves 527 institutions and schools in all 50 US states, donating 300 to 400 copies of one book at a time. Since its founding, Radius founder and Creative Director David Chickey estimates that the non-profit has donated nearly 40,000 books, especially targeting rural and underserved libraries. Ash Creek Elementary School District, Denver Public Library, New Mexico State University Library, and Memphis College of Art are a few of Radius Books' donation recipients. == Titles == Radius Books published 4 titles in their first year. From 2008 to 2010, they doubled their production, publishing 8 titles. Since 2011, Radius has published 15 to 20 titles each year, ranging from monographs on historical and contemporary artists as well as featuring museum collections and exhibitions == Awards == Since its founding, Radius Books has been recognized with multiple design and publishing awards. From 2010-2015, Radius was selected eight times for the AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts)/The Design Observer Group '50 Books/ 50 Covers' competition, which is the longest running design competition in the United States. In 2010, Michael Light: LA Day/LA Night and David Taylor: Working the Line were recognized for their inventive cover designs.http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/Radius%20Books/year%3A%222010%22%20credits%3A%22Radius%20Books%22/detail/relevance/asc/0/7/21653/michael- light-la-dayla-night/1 In 2012, Fred Sandback, published in conjunction with David Zwirner Gallery, was an AIGA book selection.
