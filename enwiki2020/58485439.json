    "text": "Dark Round the Edges is the first album by British psychedelic rock group Dark, released in 1972. The original edition is considered to be a \"holy grail\" for record collectors. ==Release== The album was originally released in an edition of 64 copies. Most copies were given away to family and close friends of the band, but some were sold. It is now considered to be one of the most valuable records, with original copies having been sold for prices upward to \u00a36,000 and \u00a325,000, depending on the version. In 2016, it was listed as the 17th most valuable record of all time by NME. The album has been reissued several times. ==Reception== Richie Unterberger of AllMusic commented that the songs were \"largely vehicles for some involved, fuzzy hard rock guitar soloing\" and compared the \"softer parts\" to Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the back cover of Dark Around the Edges. ;Dark * Steve Giles \u2013 vocals, guitar, producer * Martin Weaver \u2013 guitar * Ronald Johnson \u2013 bass guitar * Clive Thorneycroft \u2013 drums ;Production and additional personnel * Alan Bowley \u2013 recording engineer * Steve Giles \u2013 photography, design ==Notes== == References == Category:1972 albums Category:Psychedelic rock albums by English artists ",
