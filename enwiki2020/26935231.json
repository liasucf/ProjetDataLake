    "text": "Daniel S. Hurley (born January 16, 1973) is an American basketball coach who currently coaches University of Connecticut men's basketball team. Hurley was named head coach of the Huskies on March 22, 2018, after six years at the University of Rhode Island and two years at Wagner College. Hurley turned down an aggressive long-term offer from Rhode Island in order to lead UConn. Prior to Wagner, Hurley was head coach of Saint Benedict's Preparatory School, where he is credited with building the New Jersey school into one of the top high school basketball programs in America. Hurley played five years of college basketball, including a redshirt year, at Seton Hall. During his first three seasons, his head coach was P. J. Carlesimo. Hurley is the youngest son of Hall of Fame high school coach Bob Hurley. His brother Bobby Hurley is a former Sacramento Kings guard and the current basketball head coach at Arizona State University. From 2010 to 2013, Bobby was one of Dan's assistant coaches at both Rhode Island and Wagner. On September 6th, 2019, Hurley had surgery to replace two disks in his neck with artificial ones. Doctors told Hurley the condition was part hereditary and part the result of years of wear and tear associated with being a life-long athlete. Hurley returned to work less than two weeks after surgery. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Connecticut profile Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from New Jersey Category:Basketball players from New Jersey Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:High school basketball coaches in New Jersey Category:Point guards Category:Rhode Island Rams men's basketball coaches Category:Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's basketball coaches Category:Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Jersey City, New Jersey Category:St. Anthony High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:UConn Huskies men's basketball coaches Category:Wagner Seahawks men's basketball coaches ",
