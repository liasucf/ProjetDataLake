    "text": "\"Kad zaspu an\u0111eli\" (\"When angels fall asleep\"), also known as \"Ostani\" (\"Stay\"), was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000, performed in Croatian by Goran Karan. Karan wanted to perform the song in English on the Eurovision night but he was not allowed due to the public voting. A similar vote was in place the year before where the public voted that Doris sang her song \"Marija Magdalena\" in Croatian as opposed to English . The song was performed seventeenth on the night, following Switzerland's Jane Bogaert with \"La vita cos'\u00e8?\" and preceding Sweden's Roger Pontare with \"When Spirits Are Calling My Name\". At the close of voting, it had received 70 points, placing 9th in a field of 24. The song is a love ballad, with Karan pleading with his lover to stay with him, even \"when angels fall asleep\". Goran appeared dressed in a black suit. He was accompanied by a male guitarist, two female backing singers in grey dresses, and a woman entirely hidden by a black veil. During the first verse and chorus, she simply stood near the back of the stage, but during the second chorus, she performed a dance, still hidden by the veil. At the end of the song, she removed her veil, to reveal a in a floor-length, pale blue gown. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2001 contest by Vanna with \"Strings of My Heart\".
