    "text": "Walter Mazzarri (; born 1 October 1961) is an Italian former footballer and head coach. After coaching several smaller Italian sides, Mazzarri took up a managerial position with Sampdoria in 2007; with the help of the attacking partnership of Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini, he led the team to qualify for the UEFA Cup in his first season, and subsequently reached the Coppa Italia final the next year. In 2009, he joined Napoli, where he implemented a 3\u20134\u20133 formation with which he later became associated. With the attacking trio of Ezequiel Lavezzi, Edinson Cavani and Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk, he helped the team qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history in 2011, and won the Coppa Italia the following season, the club's first trophy in over 20 years. In his final season with the team, he managed a second-place finish in Serie A, the club's best league finish in over 20 years. In 2013, he moved to Internazionale, but was later sacked halfway through his second season with the club. He later managed Torino in Serie A, and had one year in charge of Watford in England's Premier League in 2016\u201317. ==Playing career== Mazzarri, a midfielder and a product of Fiorentina's youth system, made his professional debut in 1981 for Pescara of Serie B, and played a short Serie A stint in Cagliari the following season, before being sold to Reggiana. He had his longest period at Empoli, who won promotion to Serie A for the first time during his time with the Tuscan side. After several spells with mostly minor teams, including a two-year stint with Acireale where he was part of the team who won a historic first promotion to Serie B, and then playing in the Italian second tier in 1993\u201394, Mazzarri ended his playing career in 1995 with Sassari Torres. ==Managerial career== ===Early years=== Mazzarri started his coaching career as Renzo Ulivieri's assistant at Napoli in 1998. His first spell in charge came in 2001\u201302 for Sicilian Serie C2 team Acireale, where he had been a player from 1992 to 1994. Subsequently, he returned to his native Tuscany to coach Pistoiese of Serie C1 in 2002\u201303 and Livorno of Serie B in 2003\u201304, bringing the amaranto led by Cristiano Lucarelli back to Serie A. He was coach of Reggina from 2004 to 2007, leading the Calabrian side to Serie A survival in three consecutive seasons, the last obtained on the final day of the season despite an 11-point deduction. In May 2007, Mazzarri was made an honorary citizen of Reggio Calabria, after helping the club avoid relegation during the 2006\u201307 Serie A season. ===Sampdoria=== On 31 May 2007 he was announced as new Sampdoria coach. He served as Sampdoria boss for two seasons, overseeing a considerable improvement in results, thanks to the likes of the attacking duo of Antonio Cassano, who publicly praised Mazzarri's coaching abilities, and Giampaolo Pazzini. Sampdoria's 2007\u201308 campaign ended in an impressive sixth place, which ensured qualification for the UEFA Cup. Mazzarri's fortunes declined slightly in 2008\u201309, as the blucerchiati ended their campaign in 13th place; despite this, he managed to guide his team into the Coppa Italia Final, notably defeating champions Inter 3\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals, before losing on penalties to Lazio in the final. Mazzarri left Sampdoria by mutual consent at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. ===Napoli=== On 6 October 2009 he was appointed manager of Napoli, replacing Roberto Donadoni. He finished his debut season in sixth place in Serie A, and was handed a new three-year contract at the end of the campaign. In 2010\u201311, Mazzarri's Napoli finished third in the league and qualified directly for the group phase of the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League \u2013 their first time in Europe's premier competition in 21 years. His team were known for an attacking 3\u20134\u20133 formation with a frontline of Ezequiel Lavezzi, Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk and Edinson Cavani. They finished second in their Champions League group, behind Bayern Munich but ahead of Manchester City and Villareal, to meet Chelsea in the last 16. Napoli won 3\u20131 at home in the first leg; they were subsequently beaten 4\u20131 at Stamford Bridge after extra time, being eliminated by the eventual champions. Napoli won the 2012 Coppa Italia Final over undefeated league champions champions Juventus on 20 May; this was Juventus's only loss of the season, and Napoli's first title in over 20 years. On 11 August that year, the club suffered a controversial 4\u20132 extra-time defeat to Juventus in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana, which saw two Napoli players sent off as well as Mazzarri. He left the Azzurri on 19 May 2013, after leading them to a 2nd-place finish and a spot in the Champions League at the end of the 2012\u201313 Serie A season; this was the club's best league finish in over 20 years. ===Inter=== Mazzarri as manager of Inter in September 2014 Mazzarri was officially appointed as the Inter manager on 24 May 2013, after Andrea Stramaccioni was dismissed for a poor performance in the 2012\u201313 season. On 2 July 2014, he signed a one-year extension to tie him to the team until 30 June 2016. He was sacked by Inter after a series of disappointing results on 14 November 2014, leaving the club in ninth place. He parted with the club before the 12th matchday, while they were five points below their season objective of the third position. ===Watford=== On 21 May 2016, Watford confirmed they had reached an agreement with Mazzarri to become Head Coach from 1 July 2016 on a three-year contract. He joined a club owned by his compatriot Giampaolo Pozzo, and worked without being able to speak English. Mazzarri secured Watford's Premier League status that season, finishing one place above relegation in 17th, a four-place dip on their previous campaign. It was announced on 17 May 2017 that his contract would be terminated at the end of his first season at the club. ===Torino=== On 4 January 2018, Mazzarri was appointed manager of Torino, replacing Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107. With a 7th-place finish in 2018\u201319 he led the Granata to the UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated in the play-off round by Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 4 February 2020, Mazzarri was dismissed following back-to-back 7\u20130 and 4\u20130 defeats to Atalanta and Lecce, respectively. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Nat !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record |- !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % |- |align=\"left\"|Acireale | |align=\"left\"| 1 July 2001 |align=\"left\"| 30 June 2002 |- |align=\"left\"|Pistoiese | |align=\"left\"| 1 July 2002 |align=\"left\"| 30 June 2003 |- |align=\"left\"|Livorno | |align=\"left\"| 1 July 2003 |align=\"left\"| 30 June 2004 |- |align=\"left\"|Reggina | |align=\"left\"|1 July 2004 |align=\"left\"|28 May 2007 |- |align=\"left\"|Sampdoria | |align=\"left\"|1 July 2007 |align=\"left\"|30 June 2009 |- |align=\"left\"|Napoli | |align=\"left\"|6 October 2009 |align=\"left\"|20 May 2013 |- | align=\"left\" |Internazionale | |align=\"left\"|24 May 2013 |align=\"left\"|14 November 2014 |- | align=\"left\" |Watford | |align=\"left\"|1 July 2016 |align=\"left\"|21 May 2017 |- | align=\"left\" |Torino | |align=\"left\"|4 January 2018 |align=\"left\"|4 February 2020 |- !colspan=4|Total |} ==Honours== ===Manager=== ;Sampdoria *Coppa Italia Runner-up: 2008\u201309 ;Napoli *Coppa Italia: 2011\u201312 *Supercoppa Italiana Runner-up: 2012 *Serie A Runner-up: 2012\u201313 ; Individual *Enzo Bearzot Award: 2012 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Livorno Category:Association football midfielders Category:Italian footballers Category:Serie A players Category:A.C.
