    "text": "Corporate sponsorship of major English football competitions dates back to the early 1980s, although minor competitions such as the Watney Cup and Texaco Cup were sponsored during the early 1970s. ==Sponsorship deals== The first tournament for English Football League clubs to sell its naming rights was the Watney Cup, sponsored by brewer Watney Mann which was played from 1970 to 1973. The 1970-71 season saw the Ford Sporting League, sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, take place for the first and only time, and also the start of the Texaco Cup (sponsored by Texaco) which was played until 1975. The first major English competition to negotiate a sponsorship deal was the League Cup, negotiating a \u00a32 million deal in 1982 with the National Dairy Council. It became known as the \"Milk Cup\" and has since adopted the name of its sponsors in this same way. The following season in 1983 the Football League negotiated a sponsorship deal with Canon worth \u00a33.3 million over 3 years. Since the formation of the breakaway Premier League in 1992, the competition has struck up its own sponsorship deals separately from the Football League (though it was unsponsored in its first season after a $17.1 million agreement with Bass Brewery was vetoed by Arsenal, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest). The last major English competition to negotiate a sponsorship deal was in fact its oldest, the FA Cup. The competition was sponsored by Littlewoods for four seasons, starting in 1994 in a deal with \u00a314 million. In 1998, AXA Insurance started their sponsorship of the competition for four seasons. It was always carefully named, being the \"AXA-sponsored FA Cup\", or the \"FA Cup sponsored by AXA\", and never the \"AXA Cup\". From 2002\u201303 through 2005\u201306, the FA Cup did not have a dedicated sponsor, but instead shared the team of sponsors of The Football Association. From 2006 to 2011, the FA Cup was known as \"The FA Cup sponsored by E.ON\" due to a deal with energy company E.ON. From the 2011\u201312 season to the 2013\u201314 season, the FA Cup was sponsored by Budweiser Beer and known as the FA Cup with Budweiser. ==Summary of competition sponsorship deals== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Season !Premier League !English Football League !National League !FA Cup !FA Community Shield !EFL Cup !EFL Trophy |- |1982\u201383 | rowspan=\"10\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|Did not exist | style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor | rowspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |rowspan=4|Milk Marketing Board (Milk Cup) | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |- |1983\u201384 |rowspan=3|Canon (Canon League) |- |1984\u201385 |rowspan=2|Gola (Gola League) |rowspan=4|General Motors (1984: FA Charity Shield sponsored by General Motors) (1985\u20131987: General Motors FA Charity Shield) |rowspan=3|Freight Rover (Freight Rover Trophy) |- |1985\u201386 |- |1986\u201387 |Today (Today League) |rowspan=12|General Motors (GM Vauxhall Conference) |rowspan=4|Littlewoods (Littlewoods Challenge Cup) |- |1987\u201388 |rowspan=6|Barclays (Barclays League) |rowspan=2|Sherpa Van (Sherpa Van Trophy) |- |1988\u201389 | style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |- |1989\u201390 |rowspan=4|Wellpark Brewery (Tennent's FA Charity Shield) |rowspan=2|Leyland DAF (Leyland DAF Cup) |- |1990\u201391 |rowspan=2|Rumbelows (Rumbelows Cup) |- |1991\u201392 |rowspan=3|Autoglass (Autoglass Trophy) |- |1992\u201393 | style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |rowspan=6|Coca-Cola (Coca-Cola Cup) |- |1993\u201394 |rowspan=8|Carling Brewery (FA Carling Premiership) |rowspan=3|Endsleigh (Endsleigh League) | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |- |1994\u201395 |rowspan=4|Littlewoods (FA Cup sponsored by Littlewoods) |rowspan=6|Auto Windscreens (Auto Windscreens Shield) |- |1995\u201396 |rowspan=3|Littlewoods (1995: Littlewoods Pools FA Charity Shield) (1996\u20131997: Littlewoods FA Charity Shield) |- |1996\u201397 |rowspan=8|Nationwide (Nationwide Football League) |- |1997\u201398 |- |1998\u201399 |rowspan=9|Nationwide (Nationwide Conference) |rowspan=4|AXA (AXA-Sponsored FA Cup) |AXA (AXA FA Charity Shield) |rowspan=5|Worthington Brewery (Worthington Cup) |- |1999\u20132000 |rowspan=3|One2One (One2One FA Charity Shield) |- |2000\u201301 |rowspan=5|LDV Vans (LDV Vans Trophy) |- |2001\u201302 |rowspan=3|Barclaycard (FA Barclaycard Premiership) |- |2002\u201303 | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |rowspan=19|McDonald's (2002\u20132006: The FA Community Shield in partnership with McDonald's) (2007\u20132013: The FA Community Shield sponsored by McDonald's) (2014\u20132020: The FA Community Shield supported by McDonald's) |- |2003\u201304 |rowspan=9|Carling Brewery (Carling Cup) |- |2004\u201305 |rowspan=12|Barclays (2004\u201307: FA Barclays Premiership) (2007\u201316: Barclays Premier League) |rowspan=6|Coca-Cola (Coca-Cola Football League) |- |2005\u201306 | style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |- |2006\u201307 |rowspan=5|E.ON (The FA Cup sponsored by E.ON) |rowspan=10|Johnstone's Paint (Johnstone's Paint Trophy) |- |2007\u201308 |rowspan=6|Blue Square (2007\u201310: Blue Square Premier Blue Square North Blue Square South) (2010\u201313: Blue Square Bet Premier Blue Square Bet North Blue Square Bet South) |- |2008\u201309 |- |2009\u201310 |- |2010\u201311 |rowspan=3|npower (npower Football League) |- |2011\u201312 |rowspan=3|Budweiser (The FA Cup with Budweiser) |- |2012\u201313 |rowspan=4|Capital One (Capital One Cup) |- |2013\u201314 |rowspan=11| Sky Bet (2013\u201316: Sky Bet Football League) (2016\u201324: Sky Bet EFL) ||Skrill (The Skrill Premier The Skrill North The Skrill South) |- |2014\u201315 |rowspan=8|Autorama Group (2014\u201315: Vanarama Conference) (2015\u201322: Vanarama National League) | style=\"background:#eee;\"|No sponsor |- |2015\u201316 |rowspan=6|Emirates (The Emirates FA Cup) Heads Up (2020 Heads Up FA Cup Final) |- |2016\u201317 | rowspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| No sponsor | style=\"background:#eee;\"| No sponsor | rowspan=\"3\"|Checkatrade (Checkatrade Trophy) |- |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"5\"|Carabao Energy Drink (Carabao Cup) |- |2018\u201319 |- |2019\u201320 | rowspan=\"3\"|Leasing.com (Leasing.com Trophy) |- |2020\u201321 |- |2021\u201322 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| |- |2022\u201323 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#eee;\"| |- |2023\u201324 |} ==Summary of front of shirt sponsorship deals== Shirt sponsorship in English football clubs was first pioneered by Coventry City in 1974 after they were sponsored by Talbot. The first English club to secure a sponsorship deal was Derby County, they only wore the football tops featuring the Saab sponsor once for a photo shoot. Issues arose with teams wearing sponsored shirts in the early 1980s. The scheduled broadcast of a match between Aston Villa and Brighton and Hove Albion on 22 October 1980 was cancelled as both teams refused to play without sponsors on their shirts. Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers were fined \u00a31,000 for wearing shirts with advertising in FA Cup games in January 1981. Nottingham Forest were fined \u00a37,000 by UEFA for a similar offence in February 1981. By 1987, every league club had a shirt sponsorship deal. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | 2020-2021 Club ! scope=\"col\" | Sponsor ! scope=\"col\" | Start date ! scope=\"col\" | End date ! scope=\"col\" | Amount ! scope=\"col\" |Per year |- | Arsenal || Fly Emirates || 2019 || 2024 || \u00a3200m || \u00a340m |- | Aston Villa || Cazoo || 2020 || 2021 || \u00a312m || \u00a36mAston Villa reveal \u2018UK\u00a36m a year\u2019 Cazoo shirt sponsorshipSportsPro, 29 June 2020 |- | Brighton & Hove || American Express || 2013 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Burnley || Love Bet || 2019 || 2021 || \u00a3m || \u00a3mShirt Sponsors of All 20 Clubs in Premier League, 2019-2020Sports Khabri, 27 September 2019 |- | Chelsea || Three || 2020 || 2025 || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Crystal Palace || W88 || 2020 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Everton || Cazoo || 2020 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Fulham || BETVICTORFulham ink BetVictor shirt sponsorship for Premier League returnSportsPro, 8 September 2020|| 2020 || 2022 || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Leeds United || SPOTOP | 2020 | || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Leicester City || Tourism Authority of Thailand || 2020 || 2021 || \u00a3m || \u00a3mLeicester City score Thailand tourism shirt sponsorship for 2020/21SportsPro, 24 July 2020 |- | Liverpool || Standard Chartered || 2019 || 2023 || \u00a3160m || \u00a340m |- | Man City || Etihad Airways || 2012 || 2021 || \u00a3400m || \u00a340m |- | Man United || Chevrolet || 2014 || 2021 || \u00a3371m || \u00a347m |- | Newcastle || Fun88 || 2017 || 2020 || \u00a324m || \u00a38m |- | Sheffield United || Union Standard Group || 2019 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Southampton || Sportsbet.io || 2020 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Tottenham || AIA || 2019 || 2027 || \u00a3320m || \u00a340m |- | West Brom || Ideal Boilers || 2018 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | West Ham || BetwayWest Ham sign \u2018record\u2019 Betway extensionSportsPro, 24 May 2019|| 2015 || 2025 || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |- | Wolverhampton || ManBet X || 2019 || ? || \u00a3m || \u00a3m |} ==Summary of kit manufacturer deals== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Club ! scope=\"col\" | End date ! scope=\"col\" | Per year ! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer |- | Man United || 2025 || \u00a375m || Adidas |- | Arsenal || 2024 || \u00a360m || Adidas |- | Chelsea || 2032 || \u00a360m || Nike |- | Liverpool || 2020 || \u00a345m || New Balance |- | Tottenham || 2033 || \u00a330m || Nike |- | Man City || 2029 || \u00a365m || Puma |- | Everton || ? || \u00a3m || Hummel |} ==References== ==External links== *Branding, sponsorship and commerce in football Centre for the Sociology of Sport, University of Leicester Sponsorship Category:Sports sponsorships ",
