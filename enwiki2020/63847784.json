    "text": "Percy Robert Farrant (25 April 1868 \u2013 4 September 1921) was a Welsh first- class cricketer and educator. The son of Robert Farrant, he was born at Llandudno in April 1868. He was educated at Repton School, before going up to New College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made two appearances in first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1890, against the touring Australians and the Gentlemen of England, though without much success in either match, with Farrant taking one wicket, that of the Gentlemen of England's Ernest Coxon, in addition to scoring 12 runs. After graduating from Oxford, Farrant was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Worcestershire and Warwickshire Volunteer Artillery in July 1892, with promotion to lieutenant coming in November 1893. He resigned his commission in February 1894. After leaving the Volunteer Artillery, Farrant became an assistant master at Malvern College. He died aboard off the coast of the Maldives in September 1921. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1868 births Category:1921 deaths Category:People from Llandudno Category:People educated at Repton School Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:Welsh cricketers Category:Oxford University cricketers Category:Volunteer Force officers Category:Welsh schoolteachers ",
