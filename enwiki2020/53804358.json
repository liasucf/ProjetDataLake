AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the album a score of three out of five stars, highlighting the singles \"Break My Heart\" and \"Guys My Age\", as well as the songs previously included in their EP Brand New Moves (its title track and \"Fuqboi\"), saying: \"While Hey Violet sometimes seem to have more personality than their material on From the Outside, they handle the album's many stylistic shifts without giving listeners too much sonic whiplash.\" \"Guys My Age\" was named one of the Best Songs of 2016 by The New York Times, who called it 'teen-pop's revenge: an urgent dark song about sexual rebellion' and one of the 20 Best Songs of 2016 by V Magazine. Idolator says the second single \"Break My Heart\" is a 'monstrous electro-anthem' and declares, the band is 'destined to have a massive year.' Alternative Press calls the track 'irresistible,' while Nylon raves, 'Hey Violet knows how to write a good pop hook and 'Break My Heart' is a testament to that. This song has spunk.' Jon Winkler of The Young Folks gave a highly positive review, saying: 'Equal parts scrappy and crafted, From the Outside is a strong and memorable debut album from a band that thrives on the one thing all young bands seem to forsake: spunk.' Substream Magazine's Gabriel Aikins calls the album a 'good, bold step into the future,' and adds that the songwriting 'never fails.' ==Track listing== Credits taken from iTunes. ==Personnel== *Rena Lovelis \u2013 lead vocals *Casey Moreta \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Miranda Miller \u2013 rhythm guitar, keyboards, synthesizer, backing vocals *Iain Shipp \u2013 bass guitar, synth bass *Nia Lovelis \u2013 drums, percussion, electronic percussion, backing vocals ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 67 |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums produced by Jason Evigan Category:Albums produced by Cirkut ",
