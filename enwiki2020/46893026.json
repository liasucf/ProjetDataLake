The Vilamaj\u00f3 House Museum is the materialization of an initiative of the School of Architecture at the University of the Republic which, in agreement with the Ministry of Education and Culture, owner of the property, opened its doors to the public in May 2012. The museum has been envisaged as a research and promotion center addressing the life and work of Vilamaj\u00f3 and of architecture and design as disciplines open to the society. ==The house== Interior view Interior view The house that Vilamaj\u00f3 built for his family in 1930 in Montevideo is the first modern dwelling to open its doors as a museum in Uruguay.
