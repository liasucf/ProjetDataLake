    "text": "The Trump Death Clock on May 19, 2020. As of October 15, 2020, the number is over 129,600. The Trump Death Clock started as a website, and was later presented in billboard form in Times Square, displaying a claim to the number of deaths attributable to U.S. President Donald Trump's inaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The clock was created by Eugene Jarecki. The billboard is on Broadway and West 43rd Street in Manhattan, New York City. The counter is based on the claim that had measures been implemented one week earlier, 60% of American COVID-19 deaths would have been avoided. On June 20, 2020, Eugene Jarecki drove a mobile version during the 2020 Trump Tulsa rally to ensure that Trump's supporters \"[had] an opportunity to make an informed choice based on real numbers.\" ==See also== *National Debt Clock ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 works Category:Clocks in the United States Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:COVID-19 pandemic in New York City Category:Criticism of Donald Trump Category:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on politics Category:Times Square Category:Works about Donald Trump Category:Presidency of Donald Trump Category:Death in New York City Category:Death in art Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States ",
