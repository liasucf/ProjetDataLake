When Tasha and her friends walk into the club to the V.I.P. they are instantly the main attraction.

However the record debut proved that the backlash was over as he entered the Billboard Charts. ==Liner Notes== *Recorded & Mixed by Dan \"Deezy\" Naim at The Cave, Woodland Hills, California *Emcee N.I.C.E. \u2013 Lead Vocals and Backing Vocals *Suhana Machete \u2013 Bridge Lead and Backing Vocals *William \"Kelly Keys\" Armour \u2013 Producer *Marvin \"Marvelous J\" White \u2013 Remix Producer *Kenny \"Mixx\" Daniels \u2013 mastering at PatchWerk Recording Studios, Atlanta, Georgia *Distributed by Gypsy City Music *Executive Producers \u2013 Aulsondro \"Novelist\" Hamilton, Frank DeRozan, BJ Luster and Chani Gray == References == ===Notes=== Category:2014 singles Category:2014 songs ",
