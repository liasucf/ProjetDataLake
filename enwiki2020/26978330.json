    "text": "Ubiratan Guimar\u00e3es, known as Colonel Ubiratan (April 19, 1943 \u2013 September 9, 2006) was a colonel in the S\u00e3o Paulo Military Police and Brazilian politician. He was the commanding officer responsible for the Carandiru massacre. Guimar\u00e3es was killed under unclear circumstances in his S\u00e3o Paulo apartment in 2006. ==Colonel== Guimar\u00e3es joined the state military police at the age 18 and rose to the rank of colonel, the top hierarchy in the S\u00e3o Paulo Military Police. As a colonel in the military police, where he stayed for 34 years, he commanded the Pol\u00edcia Militar do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan police. In the 1970s, during the military dictatorship of Brazil, he fought guerrillas in the Vale do Ribeira, S\u00e3o Paulo. ==1992 Carandiru massacre== Guimar\u00e3es was the high-ranking police officer commanding the S\u00e3o Paulo military police in the infamous Carandiru prison massacre. He repeated that he had a \"clear conscience\" and always defended the operation, saying the order to invade the cellblock was meant to save lives as he feared that a fire set by inmates could spread. Guimar\u00e3es was originally charged with 111 counts of murder in June 2001, but the number was later reduced to 102 as there was no evidence police had killed the nine prisoners found stabbed to death. He was initially sentenced to 632 years in prison (six years each for the victims and 20 years for five attempted murders) for his mishandling of the rebellion and subsequent massacre. On 16 February 2006 the conviction was voided by a S\u00e3o Paulo court by 20 votes to two because of mistrial claims; the court accepted his argument that he was only following orders. Human rights groups around the world, such as Amnesty International, denounced the reversal. Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), one of Brazil's most notorious gangs, is said to have been formed as a response to the event. ==Political life== Guimar\u00e3es entered politics after the massacre, when his name had become known to the general public. He was twice sworn in as a substitute state representative by center-right Brazilian Social Democratic Party: in January 1997 to April 1998 and from January to March 1999. In 2002 he was re-elected (with number 14 111) state representative for S\u00e3o Paulo with 56,155 votes. As a Member of Parliament, the retired colonel made public safety his main banner. Guimar\u00e3es was against the disarming of the population and in favor of stricter rules for detainees, such as the ending of conjugal visits and furloughs. ==Death== On Saturday night September 9, 2006 Guimar\u00e3es was killed by a shot in his abdomen from a .38 caliber weapon. At around 22:30 the following day he was found in his S\u00e3o Paulo apartment in the neighborhood Jardins. The corpse showed no signs of struggle, and the door was left ajar. The body was lying on its back, covered only by a towel. The governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Cl\u00e1udio Lembo (PFL), ruled out the possible involvement of organized crime in the murder. His body was buried on the afternoon of September 11 in the Horto Florestal cemetery in northern S\u00e3o Paulo. The procession was scheduled to end in the chapel, but this was canceled due to the sheer number of people who followed the ceremony. The phrase \"\" (what goes around, comes around) was sprayed in picha\u00e7\u00e3o (a local form of graffiti) on the building where he lived \u2014 a reference to the Carandiru massacre. ==See also== * List of unsolved murders == References == Category:1943 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People murdered in Brazil Category:Assassinated Brazilian politicians Category:Assassinated police officers Category:Brazilian police officers Category:Deaths by firearm in Brazil Category:Male murder victims Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of S\u00e3o Paulo Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Police officers convicted of murder Category:Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011) politicians Category:Unsolved murders in Brazil ",
