    "text": "The H\u00e9rtevin language is a modern Eastern Aramaic or Syriac language. It was originally spoken in a cluster of villages in Siirt Province in southeastern Turkey. Speakers of H\u00e9rtevin Aramaic have emigrated mostly to the West, and are now scattered and isolated from one another. A few speakers remain in Turkey. ==Origins== H\u00e9rtevin was 'discovered' by linguist Otto Jastrow in 1970, and first described in publication by him two years later. His recordings of the language are available on Heidelberg University's Semitic Sound Archive. The speakers of the H\u00e9rtevin dialect of Neo-Aramaic are traditionally Chaldean Catholics. Their area of habitation in and around the village of Hertevin (called Hertevinler in Turkish and H\u00e4rt\u0259v\u0259n in Kurdish), near the town of Pervari in Siirt Province is at the very northeastern extreme of the area where Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages were traditionally spoken. Thus, H\u00e9rtevin is a peripheral dialect that has developed quite differently from related languages. All H\u00e9rtevin speakers are bilingual in Kurdish, and many also speak other languages. The Syriac alphabet is used for writing, but almost no literature in the H\u00e9rtevin dialect exists. Church liturgy is in Syriac. ==Phonology== Its major phonetic feature is the loss of the voiceless velar fricative x, which has become a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, \u0127. The original voiceless pharyngeal fricative has retained that pronunciation. In all the other dialects of eastern Neo-Aramaic the opposite is true: the voiceless pharyngeal fricative has been lost and merged with the voiceless velar fricative. Another feature of H\u00e9rtevin Neo-Aramaic is its set of demonstratives. As with other languages of the eastern group, H\u00e9rtevin makes no distinction between 'this' and 'that', and uses a single set of pronouns to cover both meanings: \u0101wa (m. sg.), \u0101ya (f. sg.) and \u0101ni (pl.). However, unlike the other languages, H\u00e9rtevin has developed an emphatic form of these pronouns that indicates 'this one right here': \u014dh\u0101, \u0113h\u0101 and anh\u012b. Although belonging to the eastern, or northeastern, group of Neo-Aramaic dialects, H\u00e9rtevin shares some features with the Turoyo language, of the central group, originating from nearby Mardin Province. == See also == * Aramaic language * Assyrian Church of the East * Assyrian Neo-Aramaic * Chaldean Neo-Aramaic * Syriac alphabet * Syriac language ==References== ==Further reading== * Jastrow, Otto (1990).
