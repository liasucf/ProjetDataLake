    "text": "Pi2 Cygni, Latinized from \u03c02 Cygni, is a triple star system in the northern constellation of Cygnus. It is visible to the naked eye about 2.5\u00b0 east- northeast of the open cluster M39, having an apparent visual magnitude of 4.24. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 2.95 mas, it is located at a distance of roughly 1,100 light years from the Sun. The inner pair of stars in this system form a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 72.0162 days and an eccentricity of 0.34. The primary, component A, is a B-type giant star with a stellar classification of B2.5 III. It is a Beta Cephei variable with an estimated 8.4 times the mass of the Sun and around 7.1 times the Sun's radius. The star is roughly 33 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 50 km/s. It is radiating 8,442 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of around 20,815 K. The third member of this system is a magnitude 5.98 star at an angular separation of 0.10 arc seconds along a position angle of 129\u00b0, as of 1996. ==Historical names== In Chinese, (), meaning Flying Serpent, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03c02 Cygni, \u03b1 Lacertae, 4 Lacertae, \u03c01 Cygni, HD 206267, \u03b5 Cephei, \u03b2 Lacertae, \u03c3 Cassiopeiae, \u03c1 Cassiopeiae, \u03c4 Cassiopeiae, AR Cassiopeiae, 9 Lacertae, 3 Andromedae, 7 Andromedae, 8 Andromedae, \u03bb Andromedae, \u03ba Andromedae, \u03c8 Andromedae and \u03b9 Andromedae.
