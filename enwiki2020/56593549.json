The bill is sponsored by U.S. Representative Pat Tiberi (R\u2013OH) and enables selected individuals who lose their jobs to use tax credits offered under the American Health Care Act to receive continued coverage under their employer sponsored health insurance plans. This bill has no effect until the American Health Care Act of 2017 is enacted into law. In February 2018, this bill was used as the vehicle for immigration legislation which was debated in the United States Senate. The immigration legislation aimed to resolve the status of undocumented immigrants, who were protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program after the program was rescinded by the Trump administration. The legislation would also introduce additional immigration reforms.
