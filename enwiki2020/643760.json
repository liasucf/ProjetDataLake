Seda's comic work was centered around taboo sexual subject matters, including swinging and bestiality. Her work intended to push boundaries that individuals upheld as communal prejudices. The reaction of Seda's audience is \"less an affirmation of community standards than a kind of self-righteous consumerism.\"Pizzino, Christopher (2016).

Seda was originally cut from the film, as her interview answers were seen as bland, so Seda requested that she be given a second chance and preplanned a response that would gain greater reaction. Seda explained how she was not inherently \"valuable\" because she was not beautiful because of her \"funny teeth.\" She attributed her value to the work she had done in spite of her gap saying, she was \"kind of glad that [her] teeth are like this, because if I had nice straight teeth, I might never have done anything.\u201dfilmmaker., Blank, Les, Gap-Toothed Women., , retrieved 2018-12-03 She created a poster for the film.\"Dori Seda\".

She had contracted silicosis from firing metallic glazes, which release toxic fumes, without the use of a protective mask in her ceramics work. She was also a heavy smoker who suffered from emphysema which contributed to the deterioration of her health. After Seda's death, conflict arose over who owned the rights to reproduce her work. Friends of Seda's wanted to collect and publish her work (the collection that became Dori Stories), but at her death, Seda's estate passed to the next of kin, her mother. Due to the sexual nature of Seda's work, her mother did not wish to see Seda's writing in print again, and refused the right to publish it. However, a year prior to her death, Seda had written a will which gave partner Don Donahue full ownership of her work if she died. The will was written in a humorous tone, opening with the statement, \"This is sort of a contract and sort of a will (although I don\u2019t plan on dying soon.)\u201d Regardless, this document held the legal power of a written contract and allowed for Seda's full body of work to be published.The will was witnessed and signed by Seda, Krystine Kryttre, Dan O'Neill and Donohue. Seda's friends were able to successfully file the will in 1991, leaving Donohue full ownership of her work. == Notes == == References == * Yronwode, Catherine and Trina Robbins.
