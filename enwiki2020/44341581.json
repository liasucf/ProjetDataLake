    "text": "Frederick Rosse (1867 \u2013 20 June 1940) was an English composer of light music and operetta. After studying music in Germany and elsewhere, he began his career as a musical director at London theatres. He composed suites of incidental music for several plays, orchestral suites and songs. His \"Doge's March\" from his music for The Merchant of Venice was his most enduring piece. ==Early life and career== Rosse was born on the Isle of Jersey.Scowcroft, Philip. \"A First Garland of British Light Music Composers\", MusicWeb- International, accessed 10 November 2014 He was a godson of the celebrated actress Lillie Langtry, although she was only thirteen years old when she was given this responsibility. Rosse attended Harrow, a private boarding school in London, and studied music at the Conservatoire in Leipzig, Germany, as well as in Dresden, Brussel and Vienna. While in Leipzig, he shared lodgings with composer Frederick Delius. He began his musical career singing the minor role of Takemine (Sergeant of the Governor's Guard) in the popular musical The Geisha at Daly's Theatre in London. He was eventually promoted to chorus master there and then became a musical director in several other London theaters. He began to compose music by 1895, soon writing suites of incidental music for several stage plays. His \"Doge's March\" for The Merchant of Venice, produced by Arthur Bourchier at the Garrick Theatre in 1905, was popular for many years. He also wrote orchestral suites that were not meant for the theatre, although some were inspired by plays. By 1920, Rosse was the musical director of the Waldorf Theatre (which later became the Novello Theatre). ==Personal life and death== Rosse married Edith Marion, who had been in the cast of a touring company at the theatre, and they lived in a bungalow in Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey. His friend and business manager was Maundy Gregory who often lodged with the couple. Later, the three moved to a house in St. John's Wood called Abbey Lodge. It was later converted into Abbey Road Studios. He wrote one song each for the musicals Sergeant Brue, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse (1905), and King of Cadonia, with lyrics by Arthur Wimperis (1908).Frederick Rosse, Internet Broadway Database, accessed 10 November 2014 In 1923, he and Edith formally separated. She continued to live in the Abbey Lodge with Gregory, but not in an intimate relationship. On 15 September 1932, Edith died suddenly after refusing Gregory's request for a loan. It is speculated that she was murdered by Gregory, although no charges were ever filed against him. Rosse died in Brighton on 20 June 1940. ==Selected compositions== * \"All Aboard\" (1895 \u2013 published by Chappell) * Incidental music to an adaptation of The Three Musketeers (1898) * Incidental music to Monsieur Beaucaire (1902) (Rosse did not write the 1919 operetta of the same name.) * Incidental music to The Water Babies (1902), by Rutland Barrington, based on Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby * Incidental music to \"Almond Eye\". * Incidental music to \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1905) * \"Petite Suite Moderne\" (1908) for orchestra * \"Childhood's Memories\" * \"Suite Gabrielle\" Op. 101 (1916) for orchestra * \"Suite Dansante,\" Op.110 (1920) for piano * \"Melodie solennelle in D\" * \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1923) orchestral suite ===Songs=== * The Refractory Monk * Put Me In My Little Cell (1905, written for \"Sergeant Brue\" to lyrics by P.
