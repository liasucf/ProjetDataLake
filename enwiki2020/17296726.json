    "text": "The First Battle of Arquijas (December 15, 1834) was a battle of the First Carlist War. ==Opening shots== The battle began when Liberal forces found Carlist general Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui waiting at the bridge of Arquijas over the Ega River in Navarre; about the middle of the day, some gunshots were exchanged between the several advanced posts.Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint- Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 264. ==Battle at the bridge== The Liberals under Luis Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdova attempted to force this bridge. The division of Cordova formed itself in order of battle near the hermitage of Arquijas (Ermita de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Arquijas), which commanded the rapids near the bridge. Artillery was stationed by the Liberals near this spot to protect the passage of the Liberal forces. A column of picked men, composed of carabiniers and peseteros, attempted to cross the bridge. The Carlist Fourth Battalion of Navarre, reinforced by the tercios of Guipuzcoa,Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Historia de la Revoluci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (La Enciclopedia democr\u00e1tica, 1891), 644. protecting the bridge, threw the Liberals back.Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint-Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 265. \"A few of the most adventurous [Liberal soldiers] succeeded, with great trouble, in gaining the opposite bank; but soon the bridge was covered with carcasses, and, despite all their efforts, they could not advance a step further.\" ==Ora\u00e1's Feign== Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri C\u00f3rdova decided to attempt passage at another point, and gave orders to Marcelino de Ora\u00e1 Lecumberri to get, by a concealed march, into the rear of the Carlists, and to General Lopez, to feign a similar movement, thereby distracting the Carlists. There were about 2,000 troops under Liberal general Ora\u00e1 that had been detached by C\u00f3rdova and sent to attack the Carlist rear.F. Duncan, The English in Spain: The Story of the War of Succession Between 1834 and 1840 (Vols. 1-6) (UK: Pallas Armata). Original work published 1877.B. Saiz, Carlist Wars (1999). The Liberals' leading column, led by Ora\u00e1, advanced against the Carlist center, leaving another division to oppose the Carlist right wing.\u201cMemoir of Zumalac\u00e1rregui,\u201d Colburn\u2019s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. Sources disagree on what happened next. One source states that Zumalac\u00e1rregui sent Ituralde's advanced guard, which had not yet seen action, to counter this rearguard action. Another states that Ituralde, \"urged by an inconsiderate ardour which overcame his judgment, brought forward into sight his four battalions.\"\"Memoir of Zumalac\u00e1rregui,\" Colburn\u2019s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. These battalions, forming the left wing, had been concealed from view by the hill beneath which they were stationed. Ora\u00e1 instantly saw the snare into which he was about to fall, and changed his line of advance from north to west, moving directly upon Ituralde\u2019s division, throwing out at the same time two battalions so as to outflank him. The Carlist left wing, thus enveloped and outnumbered, was driven back in confusion.\u201cMemoir of Zumalac\u00e1rregui,\u201d Colburn\u2019s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. ==Zumalac\u00e1rregui's intervention== Zumalac\u00e1rregui then supported Ituralde, leaving only 2 or 3 battalions in observation; Zumalac\u00e1rregui hastily marched to support his left wing under Ituralde. The Liberals had already compelled Ituralde to retreat. However, Zumalac\u00e1rregui\u2019s unexpected reinforcement threw the Liberals into disorder.Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint-Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 265-6. The Liberals gave way, falling back on their second line. One source states that \"it is said that, at this juncture, Cordova, believing the day to be lost, gave Oraa orders to retreat; the latter, however, more experienced in such affairs, took upon himself the responsibility of disregarding the order.\" C\u00f3rdova did in fact retreat in disorder, abandoning the division. The division, under Ora\u00e1, found itself opposed to Ituralde in the valley of Lana. A 5-hour long combat followed. The sources again disagree on what happened next. One source states that Ora\u00e1 attacked but his detachment of over 2,000 men was dispersed in the Lana valley and fled, the nighttime covering their retreat. However, another source states that \u201cthe superiority of position and numbers had given the [Liberals] an advantage against which the Carlists found it impossible to contend.\u201d \"One has to recognize that in the battle at Arquijas,\" Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez has written, \"the victory would have been the Carlists' had it not been for the skill and daring of Or\u00e1a, who knew how to extricate himself from a dire situation, as General C\u00f3rdova had shown lamentable irresolution retreating from the battlefield before hostilities had ceased.\"Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Historia de la Revoluci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (La Enciclopedia democr\u00e1tica, 1891), 645. ==Aftermath== C\u00f3rdova was replaced by Manuel Lorenzo as a result of this defeat. C\u00f3rdova had withdrawn to Los Arcos, where he got orders from Espoz y Mina to quit his command and go to Madrid. On February 5, 1835, the Liberals attacked the same spot at the Second Battle of Arquijas but were repulsed. == Scheme of the battle == 100px ^^^^^(1)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (2) ^^ (3) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (5) (6) (7) (8) ^^ (9) ^^^^^^(4)^^^^^ ^^^(10)^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^ ^^^^^(11)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(12)^^^^^^^(13)^^^^^^^^^^^^^(14)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(15) (16)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(17)^^^^^^(18)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (19)^^ ^^ (20)^^ (1) Sierra de And\u00eda.
