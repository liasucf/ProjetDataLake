June 1946 Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Dameron was the most influential arranger of the bebop era, but also wrote charts for swing and hard bop players. The bands he arranged for included those of Count Basie, Artie Shaw, Jimmie Lunceford, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, and Sarah Vaughan. In 1940-41 he was the piano player and arranger for the Kansas City band Harlan Leonard and his Rockets. He and lyricist Carl Sigman wrote \"If You Could See Me Now\" for Sarah Vaughan and it became one of her first signature songs. According to the composer, his greatest influences were George Gershwin and Duke Ellington. In the late 1940s, Dameron wrote arrangements for Gillespie's big band, who gave the premi\u00e8re of his large-scale orchestral piece Soulphony in Three Hearts at Carnegie Hall in 1948. Also in 1948, Dameron led his own group in New York, which included Fats Navarro; the following year Dameron was at the Paris Jazz Festival with Miles Davis. From 1961 he scored for recordings by Milt Jackson, Sonny Stitt, and Blue Mitchell.Harrison, Max. \"Dameron, Tadd.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. April 2, 2011. Dameron also arranged and played for rhythm and blues musician Bull Moose Jackson. Playing for Jackson at that same time was Benny Golson, who was to become a jazz composer in his own right. Golson has said that Dameron was the most important influence on his writing. Dameron composed several bop and swing standards, including \"Hot House\", \"If You Could See Me Now\", \"Our Delight\", \"Good Bait\" (composed for Count Basie) and \"Lady Bird\". Dameron's bands from the late 1940s and early 1950s featured leading players such as Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, Wardell Gray, and Clifford Brown. In 1956 he led two sessions based on his compositions, released as the 1956 album \"Fontainebleau\" and the 1957 album \"Mating Call.\" The latter featured John Coltrane. Dameron developed an addiction to narcotics toward the end of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1957 and 1958, and served time (1959\u201360) in a federal prison hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. After his release, Dameron recorded a single notable project as a leader, The Magic Touch, but was sidelined by health problems; he had several heart attacks before dying of cancer in 1965, at the age of 48. He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. ==Tributes== * In the 1980s drummer Philly Joe Jones and trumpeter Don Sickler founded Dameronia, a band which performed the music of Tadd Dameron. * Saxophonist Dexter Gordon called him the \"romanticist\" of the bop movement. * Music critic Scott Yanow called Dameron the \"definitive arranger/composer of the bop era\". == Discography == ===As leader/co-leader=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Recorded !Released !Title !Label !Notes |- |1948? | |The Dameron Band (Featuring Fats Navarro) |Blue Note | |- |1949? |1972 |Anthropology |Spotlite | |- |1949? | |Cool Boppin' | | |- |1949? |1977 |The Miles Davis and Dameron Quartet in Paris \u2013 Festival International du Jazz, May 1949 |Columbia | |- |1953 |1953 |A Study in Dameronia |Prestige |With Clifford Brown (trumpet), Benny Golson (tenor sax), Idrees Sulieman (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto sax), Herb Mullins (trombone), Oscar Estell (baritone sax), Percy Heath (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums); most tracks also issued on Memorial |- |1956 |1956 |Fontainebleau |Prestige |With Kenny Dorham (trumpet), Henry Coker (trombone), Cecil Payne (baritone sax), Sahib Shihab (alto sax), Joe Alexander tenor sax), John Simmons (bass), Shadow Wilson (drums) |- |1956 |1957 |Mating Call |Prestige |Quartet, with John Coltrane (tenor sax), John Simmons (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums) |- |1962 |1962 |The Magic Touch |Riverside |With Clark Terry, Ernie Royal Charlie Shavers and Joe Wilder (trumpet), Jimmy Cleveland and Britt Woodman (trombone), Julius Watkins (French horn), Jerry Dodgion and Leo Wright (alto sax, flute), Jerome Richardson (tenor sax, flute), Johnny Griffin (tenor sax), Tate Houston (baritone sax), Bill Evans (piano), Ron Carter and George Duvivier (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums); Barbara Winfield (vocals) added on two tracks |- | |1962 |The Tadd Dameron Band |Jazzland | |} ===As sideman=== With John Coltrane * John Coltrane Plays for Lovers (Prestige, 1966) * Trane's Blues (Giants of Jazz, 1990) With Miles Davis * At Birdland (Durium, 1976) * The Early Days Vol. 1 (Giants of Jazz, 1985) * Birdland Days (Fresh Sound, 1990) With Dexter Gordon * New Trends of Jazz Volume 3 (Savoy, 1952) * Long Tall Dexter (Savoy, 1976) * Dexter Rides Again (Savoy, 1985) With Fats Navarro * Memorial Album (Blue Note, 1951) * New Trends of Jazz Vol. 5 (Savoy, 1952) * Fats-Bud-Klook-Sonny-Kinney (Savoy, 1955) * Fats Navarro Memorial Theodore \"Fats\" Navarro 1923\u20131950 Volume I (London, 1956) * The Fabulous Fats Navarro Volume 1 (Blue Note, 1957) * The Fabulous Fats Navarro Volume 2 (Blue Note, 1957) * Fats Navarro Featured with the Tadd Dameron Quintet (Jazzland, 1961) * Fats Navarro Memorial Volume 1 (CBS, 1964) * Prime Source (Blue Note, 1975) * Fat Girl (Savoy, 1977) * Featured with the Tadd Dameron Band (Milestone, 1977) * At Royal Roost Volume 1 (Jazz View, 1991) * Fats Blows 1946\u20131949 (Giants of Jazz, 1991) * Royal Roost Sessions 1948 (Fresh Sound, 1991) With Charlie Parker * Bird Lives (Continental, 1962) * Pensive Bird (Ember, 1969) * Broadcast Performances Vol. 2 (ESP Disk, 1973) ==References== ==Further reading== * Combs, Paul.
