    "text": "Yorkey Crossing is a ford in the Australian state of South Australia located at the head of Spencer Gulf in the gazetted locality of Emeroo about north of Port Augusta. As of 2014, it is the site of an unsealed road that serves as a by-pass route around the head of the gulf for 'over dimensional vehicles' (i.e. greater than wide and high), which are not permitted to cross the gulf using the Joy Baluch AM Bridge. It is also near the location of the crossing (also known as Yorkey Crossing) for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway (now called the Trans-Australian Railway) built after 1911. It is considered to be the most north easterly part of Eyre Peninsula. It is commonly known by the possessive 'Yorkey's Crossing', such as when mentioned in episode 3 of the 2020 ABC television drama Stateless.https://www.transcontinental.com.au/story/5274345/the-future-of- yorkeys-crossing/ ==References== Category:Spencer Gulf Category:Eyre Peninsula Category:Trans-Australian Railway Category:Far North (South Australia) ",
