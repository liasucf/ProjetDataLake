    "text": "John Trent (born LaVerne Ward Browne, December 5, 1906 - May 12, 1966) was an aviator-turned-actor-turned-aviator, best known as an actor for the \"Tailspin Tommy\" adventure film series in the 1930s. From 1931 to 1941, under the stage name John Trent, Browne appeared in 16 Hollywood films. While flying was a natural for him, acting was not, and he eventually turned his back on his Hollywood career, resuming his career in aviation, as a test pilot.Pendo 1985, pp. 18\u201319. ==Early life== Born in Orange, California, as the third child of Edwin J. Browne, a farm worker, and Phebe Alice Proctor Browne. His first focus was in the legal field. Attending the University of Southern California (USC), he switched career aspirations only after completing his law studies. ==Aviation== Browne attended the Hancock School of Aeronautics and Flying School, Santa Maria, California. He found steady work as a commercial pilot for Transcontinental & Western Airways flying the Douglas DC-2 airliner, just entering service. He was also commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Air Corps Reserve. ==Film career== When the pilot was noticed by B. P. Schulberg, a Paramount Pictures executive, who happened to be a passenger on one of his TWA DC-2 flights, Browne was encouraged to try acting. Heading for Los Angeles, he did a screen test, was put on contract, and given the name, John Trent.Wagner, Bill. \"Oh, Doctor Browne.\" TWA Skyliner Magazine January 1, 1937. Retrieved: July 9, 2019. There was one stipulation Trent made with TWA before signing with Paramount... that the airline would put him on reserve in case things didn't work out. They agreed,Brumburgh Gary.\"John Trent Biography.\" IMDb, 2019. Retrieved: July 9, 2019. paying him $1 per month as he remained on reserve status. TWA press agent Bill Wagner writing in the TWA Skyliner Magazine described the first days for Trent in Hollywood. \"On the set and off, Brownie is universally well-liked by his fellow workers, and your correspondent can assure you from personal knowledge that a great sigh of relief has gone up from the Schulberg lot, because John Trent has not 'gone Hollywood'. Three months ago, Brownie alighted in Hollywood to be greeted by the usual 'gag' pictures arranged by the studio, after which we thought he would be forgotten to a greater or lesser degree. But Mr. Schulberg had taken such a liking to Brownie that he began an immediate 'build-up' of the former TWA pilot. Brownie became 'JOHN TRENT' for the screen and was immediately given a good part in John Meade's Woman, starring Edward Arnold.\" With no training and few natural instincts in the art of performing, Trent started off slowly in bit parts. As his visibility grew, he still remained pretty much overlooked in most as the second lead or supporting \"B\" movie roles presented to him at the time.\"Crack airman finds acting like flying.\" The Portsmouth Times, Portsmouth, Ohio, May 2, 1937, p. 48. Retrieved: July 9, 2019. He gained a popular following in Badge of Honor (1934), A Doctor's Diary (1937), John Meade's Woman (1937), The Great Gambini (1937) and Blossoms on Broadway (1937). Paramount cast him opposite Ann Dvorak in the comedy, She's No Lady (1937) but he proved to be a \"rather wooden leading man\". ===Tailspin Tommy=== Monogram Pictures cast him in four films based on the comic strip aviator, \"Tailspin Tommy.\"Farmer 1984, p. 130. Trent was a natural for the part of the obsessed youthful pilot who became the focus of a popular comic strip years back during the Charles Lindbergh craze of the late 1920s.Wynne 1987, pp. 172, 175. He would be supported by co-star Marjorie Reynolds as girlfriend Betty Lou and Milburn Stone as best buddy \"Skeeter\". The four films Trent starred in for Monogram were: Mystery Plane (1939), Stunt Pilot (1939), Sky Patrol (1939) and Danger Flight (1939).Beck 2016, pp. 184\u2013185. Still, his wooden performances in other films sealed his fate and, after two more film roles -- as a flight instructor in Monogram's Wolf Call (1939) and in Paramount's I Wanted Wings (1941) (also appearing in the latter in support of Ray Milland and William Holden) -- he left Hollywood for good. Trent disparaged his acting, in later years, stating, \"It was a pretty good job until politics, sex and long working hours moved in. And when talkies came in, I was finished with my growling voice.
