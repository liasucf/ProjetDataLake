The disease is caused by a variety of infectious agents, most commonly Mycoplasma haemofelis (which used to be called Haemobartonella). Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon species were reclassified as mycoplasmas. Coinfection often occurs with other infectious agents, including: feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Ehrlichia species, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum.Prevalence of Infectious Agents and Anti-Erythrocyte Antibodies in Cats with Anemia ACVIM 2009.
