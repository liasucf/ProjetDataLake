It connected Pljevlja with Fo\u010da in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Prijepolje, Sjenica and Novi Pazar in Serbia. However, construction was never completed on the Montenegrin section of the road. Section between Jasenovo Polje and Krnovo was only main road built in Montenegro during 1990s. Section from \u017dabljak to \u0160avnik was built in 2010. In January 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs published bylaw on categorisation of state roads. With new categorisation, M-6 highway was created, from R-5 regional road and parts of previous M-8 highway and R-4 regional road. ==Major intersections== ==References== M-6 ",
