The Aston Manor Local Board of Health was formed in 1869, from part of the ancient parish of Aston. It became an urban sanitary district in 1875, and then under the Local Government Act 1894 became an urban district with a directly elected council. Aston Manor covered the area today known as Aston, including Aston Park, along with Lozells. It was immediately to the north of the county borough of Birmingham. There were extensive manufacturing facilities, including those of motors and cycles with their accessories, also paper-mills, breweries, etc. The population then was largely industrial. The district contained the now publicly owned Aston Hall. Aston Manor was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough in 1903. The census of 1911 recorded a population of around 75,000 in the borough, enough for it to become a county borough in its own right.VoB - Aston Manor It instead was added to the county borough of Birmingham that year.Youngs, Volume 2 ==Notable people== * Victor Johnson (1883\u20131951) was a track cycling racer who, in 1908, won a gold medal at the Olympics.
