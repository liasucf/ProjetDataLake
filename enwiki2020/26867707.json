In 2007, the Office National de la Poste et de l'Epargne was split into Poste Niger, which handles postal services, and Finaposte, which is in charge of financial services and was subsequently privatized. This was part of a larger privatization of some of Nigeria's communication industries. ==See also== *Communications in Niger *Postage stamps and postal history of Niger ==References== Category:Postal organizations Category:Postal system of Niger Category:Government of Niger ",
