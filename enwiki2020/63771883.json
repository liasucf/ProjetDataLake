He later became a freelance cinematographer and founded Kanai Productions in 1968.

His second film, Good-Bye (1971), was the \"first post-war, post-liberation Japanese feature to be filmed in Korea,\" and according to the film scholar Oliver Dew, illustrated \"how a surreal, decided non-representational approach could block the determinations of cultural essentialism\". His 2003 work, Super Documentary: The Avant-Garde Senjutsu, was awarded the FIPRESCI award at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Kanai has been the subject of retrospectives at Oberhausen, the Lausanne Underground Film and Music Festival,, and the Harvard Film Archive. ==Selected filmography== * The Deserted Archipelago (1969) * Good-Bye (1971) * The Kingdom (1973) * The Stormy Times (1991) * Super Documentary: The Avant-Garde Senjutsu (2003) ==References== == External links == * * * Category:Japanese film directors Category:1936 births Category:People from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Nihon University alumni Category:Japanese experimental filmmakers Category:Living people ",
