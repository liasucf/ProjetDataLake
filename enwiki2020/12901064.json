    "text": "Quarry tile is a building material, usually to inch (13 to 19 mm) thick, made by either the extrusion process or more commonly by press forming and firing natural clay or shales. National Tile Contractors AssociationAmerican Society for Testing and Materials Standard ASTM C 242 Quarry tile is manufactured from clay in a manner similar to bricks.http://www.metroceramics.com/about- section/about---what-is-quarry-tile/ It is shaped from clay, and fired at a high temperature, ~2,000 F\u00b0. == Sizes and shapes == The most traditional size in the US is nominally 6 in \u00d7 6 in \u00d7 in thick. Other common sizes include 4 in \u00d7 8 in and 8 in \u00d7 8 in. == Finishes == Traditional quarry tile was unglazed and either red or gray; however, modern \"decorator\" tiles come in a variety of tints and finishes. Industrial quarry tile is available with abrasive frit embedded in the surface to provide a non-slip finish in wet areas such as commercial kitchens and laboratories. == Uses == Quarry tile is extensively used for floors where a very durable material is required. It can be used either indoors or outdoors, although freeze-resistant grades of tile should be used outdoors in climates where freeze-thaw action occurs. Quarry tile is used less often as a wall finish and is occasionally used for countertops, although the wide grout joints can make cleaning of countertops difficult. Most commercial kitchens require a quarry tile to be used because of its slip resistant and non-porous properties. == Installation == For floors, quarry tile is usually set in a thick bed of cementitious mortar. For wall applications, it can be set in either a thick bed of cementitious mortar or a thin bed of mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile. == See also == * Ceramic tile * Ceramic tile cutter == References == Category:Tiling Category:Building materials Category:Architecture stubs ",
