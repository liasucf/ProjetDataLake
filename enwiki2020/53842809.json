    "text": "Miss America 2018 was the 91st Miss America pageant, though the Miss America Organization celebrated its 97th anniversary in 2017. This discrepancy is due to no national pageants being held from 1928-1932 or in 1934 because of financial problems associated with the Great Depression. The 2018 pageant was held in Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey on Sunday, September 10, 2017. This was the first Miss America pageant to be held in Atlantic City since the Miss America Organization headquarters relocated to Boardwalk Hall. The event was broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). On July 24, 2017, it was announced that Chris Harrison and Sage Steele would be returning to co-host the Miss America pageant for the second year in a row. Miss America 2017 Savvy Shields of Arkansas, officially crowned her successor Cara Mund of North Dakota as Miss America 2018 at the end of the event. ==Overview== ===Judges=== ====Preliminary judges==== From September 6\u20138, 2017, judges for the preliminary competition selected the winners of the preliminary talent and lifestyle and fitness competitions as well as the top 15 finalists for the final night of competition on September 10, 2017.
