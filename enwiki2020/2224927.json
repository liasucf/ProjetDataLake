    "text": "Tropidonophis mairii, commonly known as the common keelback, the freshwater snake, the keelback, and Mair's keelback,. www.reptile-database.org. is a species of nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. The species is endemic to Australasia. ==Etymology== The specific name, mairii, is in honor of \"Dr. Mair\", an army surgeon with the 39th Regiment of Foot, who collected the holotype.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Tropidonophis mairii, p. 166). ==Geographic range== T. mairii is found in Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Papua New Guinea. ==Description== Dorsally, T. mairii is olive, brown, or blackish, with small black spots, or with black crossbars anteriorly. Ventrally, it is lighter. The subcaudals and often also the ventrals are edged with black. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled, and arranged in 15 rows at midbody.Boulenger GA (1897). \"An account of the reptiles and batrachians collected by Dr. L. Loria in British New Guinea\". Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova 18: 694-710. (Tropidonotus mairii, pp. 703-704). T. mairii resembles some Australian venomous snakes, the taipans (genus Oxyuranus) and the rough-scaled snake (Tropidechis carinatus). T. mairii rarely grows over in total length (including tail). ==Diet== Mair's keelback feeds mainly on amphibians and small lizards. It is one of the few snakes that can eat cane toads (Rhinella marina), up to a certain size, without being harmed. ==Reproduction== T. mairii is oviparous. ==References== ==Further reading== *Cogger HG (2014).
