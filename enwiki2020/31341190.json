As the overflow drain pipe on this tank was blocked near ground level and could not drain the overflow water as designed, the overflowing water from this tank backed up through multiple other pipes and eventually began overflowing into a room next to Unit 1's control room. The failure of several supposedly water-tight seals between floors allowed the leaking water to descend into lower levels, eventually encountering and shorting out electrical equipment used for some of the nuclear control systems. One of the two redundant reactor protection system trains became unavailable due to the water damage, and the reactor control rod visual position indicators were totally disabled. Although by this point the water leak had already been stopped, the loss of the reactor control rod visual position indicators meant that the reactor could not be shut down via normal control rod operation, and would need to be shut down through an alternate system (either via an uncontrolled emergency drop of the safety shutdown rods or by utilizing the boron injection system). The operators on duty chose to slowly bring the reactor to a normal shutdown via the use of the boron injection system (which was permitted under normal operation rules), and the reactor reached a \"maintenance cold shutdown\" state on April 11, 2014. This event was rated at 'level 1' on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). Following the repair, testing, and recertification of all damaged equipment, Unit 1 was subsequently reconnected to the grid on May 28, 2014. * On September 5, 2012, two employees were mildly injured by a steam release caused by a minor chemical accident which also triggered fire alarms at the plant. *On April 10, 2011, operator error led to one of the reactors automatically shutting down. The incident had no further consequences and was rated at 'level 1' on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).Centrale de Fessenheim: une man\u0153uvre cause un incident nucl\u00e9aire de niveau 1 Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve, published 2011-04-08, accessed 2011-04-12 *On December 27, 2009, a 'level 1' incident on the INES occurred when plant matter was drawn into the Essential Service Water System intake, reducing the flow rate, although the flow remained sufficient to avoid endangering the security of the plant.Communiqu\u00e9 n\u00b02 \u00e0 17h15 - Incident en voie de r\u00e9solution \u00e0 la centrale nucl\u00e9aire de Fessenheim, published 2009-12-27, accessed 2011-03-30 *On January 24, 2004, the water in the primary circuit water of Unit 1 was contaminated by radioactive resin from a system used to filter out boron, quickly blocking several filters and endangering the integrity of the joints on the pumps.Incident \u00e0 la centrale de Fessenheim IRSN, published 2004-02-10 accessed 2011-03-30TRANCHE 1 DE LA CENTRALE NUCLEAIRE DE FESSENHEIM INCIDENTS DE JANVIER 2004 Stop Transports, accessed 2011-03-30 Seven EDF employees inhaled radioactive dust during the replacement of the filters, and another was slightly irradiated during the clean-up the following month.

The majority of the Haut-Rhin d\u00e9partement, including Fessenheim, is classified as being in a zone of moderate seismicity; the southern third is in a medium-risk zone.Quatre centrales sur une zone sismique Les quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments published 2011-03-15, accessed 2011-04-13 The most recent earthquake in this zone, with a magnitude 4.7, took place in this southern third at Sierentz in July 1980.Le risque sismique The last major earthquake in the region was the 1356 Basel earthquake, estimated to have had a Mw magnitude of up to 7.1.Centrale Nucl\u00e9aire de Fessenheim : appr\u00e9ciation du risque sismique R\u00c9SONANCE Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils SA, published 2007-09-05, accessed 2011-03-30 A report commissioned by the Swiss canton of Basel-Stadt, published in 2007, concluded that the previous seismic evaluations undertaken by both EDF and, to a lesser extent, by the Institut de radioprotection et de s\u00fbret\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire (Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute, IRSN) had underestimated the risks involved. In particular, although the location of the fault in the Rhine Rift Valley that led to the 1356 Basel earthquake was sufficiently well known for national and regional purposes, its location was not known precisely enough to evaluate a particular site. Studies conducted by other scientists have, for example, reached different conclusions about which faults might have been involved in the 1356 earthquake, its magnitude (ranging from 6.0 to 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale), and the distance from the fault to the plant (ranging from to away, compared to the distances of and used by EDF and the IRSN respectively). EDF also failed to take into account the possibility of a moderate local earthquake, which may have the potential to do greater damage than one which is larger but more distant, and the report was also critical of some aspects of the RFS 2001-01 assessment requirements. The report found that the design standards in force when the plant was built were similar to those that apply to present-day public buildings: the plant had been designed to accommodate movement, but it was not possible to determine whether or not the safety margins used would be adequate if a more realistic seismic evaluation were to be used. On March 11, 2011 the local Information and Oversight Commission announced that it was commissioning two independent second opinions, to be delivered as soon as possible, one on 'the safety of the plant in the event of an earthquake of magnitude 7.2, corresponding to the new seismic reference point proposed by the Swiss experts', the other on the 'redundancy of the cooling systems' in case of flooding.Centrale de Fessenheim : la CLIS demande deux nouvelles contre-expertises Le Parisien, published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-11 GSIEN has been commissioned to produce one of the reports.Alsace | Fessenheim : contre- expertises et nouvelles \u00e9tudes L'Alsace, published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-11 ===Flood=== Although situated around Le risque d'inondation de la centrale \u00e0 Fessenheim sera r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9 Nouvelobs, published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-13 below the level of the adjacent Grand Canal d'Alsace, it is not clear whether, taking into account the calculation methods in the 1960s, the design took adequate account the consequences of a breach in the canal. In its initial report following the 1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood, the Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety (now part of the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute) called for the risk of flooding at Fessenheim to be re-examined due to the presence of the canal.Rapport sur l'inondation du site du Blayais survenue le 27 d\u00e9cembre 1999 Institute for Nuclear Protection and Safety, published 2000-01-17, accessed 2011-03-21 On March 11, 2011 the local Information and Oversight Commission announced that it has commissioned an urgent report on the 'redundancy of the cooling systems' in case of flooding and that another report 'to determine the areas to strengthen to guarantee the safety of the plant in the event of a breach in the canal', which had already started, is expected in June 2011.Fessenheim : contre-expertises demand\u00e9es France 3, published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-11 ===Aquifer=== The station is built on top of a large aquifer (French Foss\u00e9 rh\u00e9nan, German Oberrhein-Aquifer), contamination of which would be very harmful. A concrete slab is built below the reactor in order to reduce the risk of polluting the aquifer. ===Cooling water=== In August 2018, the plant was shut down during a heat wave to ensure that cooling water being released into the nearby river did not overheat it. ==Opposition== Opposition to the Fessenheim plant dates back to the 1970s when its construction was proposed, and in June 1977 the pirate radio station Radio Verte Fessenheim (Green Radio Fessenheim) began broadcasting against the plant.Teil 11: Internationale Rundfunk- und Fernseh-Chronik Internationale Rundfunk und Fernseh-Chronik, accessed 2011-04-14 There have been concerns about the seismic safety of the plant and, following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents, on March 21 the local Information and Oversight Commission for the plant called for the seismic risk to be re-evaluated based on a 7.2 magnitude earthquake; the plant was originally designed for a 6.7 magnitude earthquake. The Swiss cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Jura have also said that they are going to ask the French government to suspend the operation of Fessenheim while undertaking a safety review based on the lessons learned from Japan.Trois cantons suisses demandent l'arr\u00eat de la centrale nucl\u00e9aire de Fessenheim Associated Press on Yahoo!, published 2011-03-30, accessed 2011-03-30 The German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has called for a temporary closure in line with the 3-month shutdown of pre-1981 plants ordered in Germany.Atomkraft: Fessenheim bereitet dem Land Sorgen Stuttgarter Nachrichten, published 2011-03-23, accessed 2011-04-06 On March 29 the Franche-Comt\u00e9 Regional Council went further and voted for the plant to be closed, the first time a French Regional Council has passed such a vote.Les conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de Franche-Comt\u00e9 votent une motion pour la fermeture de la centrale nucl\u00e9aire de Fessenheim dans le Haut-Rhin La Tribune, published 2011-03-29, accessed 2011-03-30 On April 6 the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt also voted for the plant to be closedLe Grand Conseil de B\u00e2le-Ville exige l\u2019arr\u00eat de la centrale de Fessenheim LeMatin, published 2011-04-06, accessed 2011-04-06 as did the council of the Urban Community of Strasbourg on April 12.Le conseil municipal de Strasbourg pour la fermeture de la centrale de Fessenheim Le Monde, published 2011-04-12, accessed 2011-04-13Jacques Bigot veut faire de Fessenheim une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence mondiale sur la fin de vie du nucl\u00e9aire published 2011-04-12, accessed 2011-04-13 The European Parliament's Green members also supported the closure demands and referred the matter to the European Commission.Nucl\u00e9aire: les Verts europ\u00e9ens veulent faire de Fessenheim un \"site pilote\" Le Parisien, published 2011-04-06, accessed 2011-04-06 Around 3,800 people demonstrated near the plant on April 8; a larger demonstration is expected on April 25.Des milliers de manifestants demandent l'arr\u00eat de la centrale de Fessenheim Le Monde, published 2011-04-11, accessed 2011-04-12 The group Stop Fessenheim have collected over 63,000 signatures through an online petition calling for Fessenheim's closure,Arr\u00eater Fessenheim !

Indeed, just after the closure the French grid operator RTE explained that the closure will not impact France's security as it's being offset primarily by \"combined cycle gas plant in Landivisiau\". ==Closure announcements== After his victory in the 2012 Presidential Election, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande confirmed his plan to close the plant in 2017.France Soir, published 2012-05-02: Pr\u00e9sidentielle : Hollande confirme sa volont\u00e9 de fermer Fessenheim In September 2012, he ordered to close the plant by the end of 2016.Le Figaro 8 September 2015: La fermeture de la centrale nucl\u00e9aire de Fessenheim \u00e0 nouveau repouss\u00e9e In September 2015, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal (Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy since April 2014), said a closure before the end of the term of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande (that ends in May 2017) would furthermore be her intention. Royal has suggested turning the plant into a Tesla factory. In June 2016, EDF demanded a settlement from the State for compensation. On 24 August 2016, Le Monde wrote that a settlement has been stipulated.EDF et l'Etat trouvent un accord \u00e0 400 millions d\u2019euros pour fermer Fessenheim On 9 April 2017, the plant was ordered to close after the Flamanville 3 unit comes online, expected to begin operation in late 2018, later reported to 2019, keeping the French nuclear generation capacity below the legal limit of 63.2 GWe.
