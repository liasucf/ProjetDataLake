    "text": "The 2019 Lansing Ignite FC season was the only season for the club. The Ignite played in USL League One, the third division of American soccer. The team folded after the season ended. == Background == In September 2018, the Lansing State Journal reported that the owners of the Lansing Lugnuts, a local minor league baseball team, had presented plans to Lansing City Council for a professional soccer team to play at Cooley Law School Stadium, also home to the Lugnuts. On October 8, the city council unanimously approved the plans, which are expected to cost the city $1 million over the course of a five-year contract. This also signaled the end of the Lansing United men's team, as United owner Jeremy Sampson became the new club's general manager; however, Lansing United Women would continue to operate as planned. On October 25, 2018, USL League One officially announced Lansing Ignite FC as its ninth founding member team, to begin play in 2019. On November 14, 2018, Lansing Ignite FC announced Nate Miller as the inaugural head coach.Friend, Phil (November 14, 2018) Lansing Ignite Soccer's First Coach, Nate Miller, Ready to Bring Championships to the City.
