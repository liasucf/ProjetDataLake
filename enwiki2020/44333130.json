He was sentenced to 22 years in prison in connection with the healthcare-fraud conviction and ordered to pay approximately $18 million in restitution.http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23220975/former-nfl-player- monty-grow-gets-22-years-prison-fraud On October 21, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that the evidence was sufficient to support Grow\u2019s convictions, and that the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury were not coercive or prejudicial, and that Grow invited any error that the district court may have committed. The Eleventh Circuit, however, vacated the sentence on Count I of the indictment and remanded the case for further proceedings.United States v. Grow (Case No. 18-11809 11th Cir.
