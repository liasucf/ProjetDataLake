Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 == Design & Development == The Ibex was designed by Hall to investigate the reduced wetted area of the pod and boom configuration, hands off spiral stability of a gull wing, and the low speed performance of wide NACA slotted flaps. It also features a V tail, of water ballast and a wingspan to comply with FAI Standard Class rules. On one of its first flights the Ibex showed significant tail flutter. Initially Hall considered replacing the tail with a conventional empennage and tailSoaring, November 1967 but ended up moving the ruddervator counterweights from the tips to the roots which eliminated the problem.Soaring, October 1974 ==Operational history== The Ibex was still flying in 1980 and was eventually donated to the National Soaring Museum. ==Aircraft on display== *National Soaring Museum - 1 in storage ==Specifications (Hall Ibex)== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *The IBEX - designed by Stan Hall Category:1950s United States sailplanes Category:Stan Hall gliders ",
