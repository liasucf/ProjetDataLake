    "text": "Point is the fourth studio album by Japanese recording artist Cornelius. It was first released in Japan on October 24, 2001 by Trattoria Records, and later re-released worldwide in 2002 by Matador Records. It peaked at number 4 on the Oricon Albums Chart. The album was released on CD again by Warner Records in 2019, along with a second disc of the Five Point One music video collection. ==Composition== In a retrospective piece, Drowned in Sounds Samuel Rosean describes Point as a Shibuya-kei album, albeit \"only [in] the most abstract and contextual manner\", noting that its \"spacey guitar and synth- heavy production\" was more comparable to artists such as Stereolab and The Notwist. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Point received an average score of 82 based on 24 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly described Point as \"11 irresistible sound collages that feature driving beats, amiable guitar acoustics, and a quadraphonic sense of aural play that encourages rampant headphone abuse.\" LA Weeklys Dan Epstein found it to be a \"consistently whimsical and inventive\" record, while The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray called it \"a magnificent piece of pop architecture.\" AllMusic editor Heather Phares found that despite Point eschewing the \"stylistic about-faces\" of Fantasma, \"the restraint and cohesion Oyamada brings to the album make its louder and crazier moments... that much more distinctive\". Blenders Alex Pappademas deemed it an improvement over Fantasma, with less \"stylistic range\" but a more refined pop sensibility. Fiona Sturges of The Independent found that Cornelius had \"honed his cut-and- paste sensibilities into something more coherent and utterly beautiful.\" Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said, \"More rounded and less determinedly schizo than Fantasma, Point is a great album of delicious odd-pop made by a whimsically modest genius. Guardian critic Garry Mulholland was more critical, panning the music as \"noises in search of a song, a groove or, indeed, a point\". ==Music videos== For the album's tour, Cornelius and his band created music videos for each song, which played behind them. Richard Wolfson of The Daily Telegraph described the overall effect, \"A Cornelius show is a blur of precision-perfect stops and starts, visual gags, unusual camera angles and sudden visceral leaps into new musical and visual styles.\" In 2004, Matador Records released a DVD called Five Point One including all these music videos. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001\u201302) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon) | 4 |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 albums Category:Cornelius (musician) albums ",
