    "text": "Execution Rocks Light is a lighthouse in the middle of Long Island Sound on the border between New Rochelle and Sands Point, New York. It stands tall, with a white light flashing every 10 seconds. The granite tower is painted white with a brown band around the middle. It has an attached stone keeper's house which has not been inhabited since the light was automated in 1979. == History == This island on which this lighthouse sits is claimed to derive its name from colonial New York, when slaveowning settlers of Sands Point disposed of troublesome slaves by chaining them to the rocks during low tide to let them drown; this tale is first recorded by Robert Caro in 1974.Caro, Robert A. \"The Power Broker\" Random House 1974, p. 151 A 1964 account in The Journal of Long Island History claims that in fact, murderers were manacled with chains to staples driven into the rock at low tide. A more likely etymology is that the British Admiralty named them Executioner's Rocks because so many ships ran aground on the treacherous rocks. On March 3, 1847, the United States Congress appropriated $25,000 for creation of Execution Rocks Lighthouse. Designed by Alexander Parris, construction was completed in 1849, although it was not lit until 1850. Over the years, it has survived both a fire and a shipwreck. The island is under the authority of the United States Coast Guard and is off limits to the public. It can be seen, however, during the Long Island Lighthouse Society's Spring Cold Coast Cruise, and from the Throgs Neck Bridge. A Daboll trumpet was added to Execution Rocks Light on Jan 25, 1869.History of American Steam Navigation, John H. Morrison, W. F. Sametz & Co., New York, 1908, p. 579 Before being executed for murder, serial killer Carl Panzram claimed in a posthumous autobiography that in the summer of 1920 that he raped and killed a total of ten sailors and dumped their bodies at sea near Execution Rocks Light. On November 25, 1958, Execution Rocks Light was the location of a pivotal scene in the first season episode \"The Bird Guard\" of Naked City. On May 29, 2007, the Department of the Interior identified Execution Rocks Light Station as surplus under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Execution Rocks Light Station. On January 27, 2009, the Secretary of the Interior announced that Execution Rocks Light would be transferred to the Philadelphia-based Historically Significant Structures, which would partner with the Science Museum of Long Island to restore the light.Newsday, January 27, 2009, \"Philly group gets care of Execution Rocks Lighthouse\" The lighthouse was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Adventures in 2009. == Chronology == right A chronological history of the lighthouse from the Coast Guard: *1847, March: Congress appropriated $25,000 for the light to be built. *1849, May: Construction was completed. *1850: The lighthouse was first lit. *1856: A fourth order Fresnel lens was installed. *1868: The keeper's quarters were added.
