    "text": "This page contains a list of the oldest living Major League Baseball player since the start of professional league play in 1871. ==Overview== Bill Lennon was the oldest player in baseball on his team's Opening Day of the National Association, the first major league on professional baseball, and Harry Wright became the oldest player when his team played its first game the following day. Wright remained the oldest player until Nate Berkenstock played in the last game of the season, his only appearance in a professional game. Berkenstock remained the oldest to have played until he died, which has been the pattern since then. A list of the same players appears in a slightly different format on the Baseball-reference website. ==Players== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background:#ffffbb;\" | || = member of the Baseball Hall of Fame |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Born !scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Died !scope=\"col\" |Age !scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Team(s) !scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Start and end dates as oldest ballplayer !scope=\"col\" | Duration as oldest player |- |data-sort- value=\"Lennon, Bill\"|Bill Lennon || January 3, 1845 Brooklyn, New York || August 19, 1910 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania || || Fort Wayne Kekiongas (1871) Washington Nationals (1872) Baltimore Marylands (1873) || May 4, 1871 \u2013 May 5, 1871 || |- |style=\"background:#ffffbb;\" data-sort-value=\"Wright, Harry\"|Harry Wright || January 10, 1835 Sheffield, England || October 3, 1895 Atlantic City, New Jersey || || Boston Red Stockings (1871\u20131877) || May 5, 1871 \u2013 October 30, 1871 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Berkenstock, Nate\"|Nate Berkenstock || September 17, 1832 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania || February 23, 1900 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania || || Philadelphia Athletics (1871) || October 30, 1871 \u2013 February 23, 1900 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Pearce, Dickey\"|Dickey Pearce || February 29, 1836 Brooklyn, New York || September 18, 1908 Wareham, Massachusetts || || New York Mutuals (1871\u20131872) Brooklyn Atlantics (1873\u20131874) St. Louis Brown Stockings (1875\u20131877) || February 23, 1900 \u2013 September 18, 1908 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Barker, Al\"|Al Barker || January 18, 1839 Lost Creek Township, Indiana || September 15, 1912 Rockford, Illinois || || Rockford Forest Citys (1871) || September 18, 1908 \u2013 September 15, 1912 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Reach, Al\"|Al Reach || May 25, 1840 London, England || January 14, 1928 Atlantic City, New Jersey || || Philadelphia Athletics (1871\u20131875) || September 15, 1912 \u2013 January 14, 1928 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Berthrong, Harry\"|Harry Berthrong || January 1, 1844 Mumford, New York || April 24, 1928 Chelsea, Massachusetts || || Washington Olympics (1871) || January 14, 1928 \u2013 April 24, 1928 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Martin, Phonney\"|Phonney Martin || August 4, 1845 New York, New York || May 24, 1933 Hollis, Queens, New York || || Troy Haymakers (1872) Brooklyn Eckfords (1872) New York Mutuals (1873) || April 24, 1928 \u2013 May 24, 1933 || |- |data-sort- value=\"Schafer, Harry\"|Harry Schafer|| August 14, 1846 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania || February 28, 1935 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania || || Boston Red Stockings/Red Caps (1871\u20131878) || May 24, 1933 \u2013 February 28, 1935 || |- |style=\"background:#ffffbb;\" data-sort- value=\"Wright, George\"|George Wright || January 28, 1847 New York, New York || August 21, 1937 Boston, Massachusetts || || Boston Red Stockings/Red Caps (1871\u20131878) Providence Grays (1879) Boston Red Stockings/Red Caps (1880\u20131881) Providence Grays (1882) || February 28, 1935 \u2013 August 21, 1937 || |- |data- sort-value=\"McKelvey, John\"|John McKelvey || August 27, 1847 New York, New York || May 31, 1944 New York, New York || ||New Haven Elm Citys (1875) || August 21, 1937 \u2013 May 31, 1944 || |- |data-sort-value=\"Witherow, Charles\"|Charles Witherow || April 1852 (approx.)
