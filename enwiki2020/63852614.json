    "text": "Transmembrane protein 247 (also known as TMEM247 or transmembrane protein ENSP00000343375) is a multi-pass transmembrane protein of unknown function found in Homo sapiens encoded by the TMEM247 gene. Notable in the protein are two transmembrane regions near the c-terminus of the translated polypeptide. Transmembrane protein 247 has been found to be expressed almost entirely in the testes.TMEM247 transmembrane protein 247 [Homo sapiens (human)]\u2014Gene\u2014NCBI. (n.d.). Retrieved April 28, 2020, from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/388946 ==Gene attributes== === General information === The TMEM247 gene is located on chromosome 2 at c2p21, nucleotide: 46,479,565-46,484,425. It has three exons and two introns. TMEM247 is 4,861 nucleotides (nt) long pre-mRNA processing, reduced to 661 nt after mRNA processing and its protein product is 219 amino acids (aa) long.Homo sapiens transmembrane protein 247 (TMEM247), mRNA (345842501). (2019). NCBI Nucleotide Database. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001145051.2 The gene does not include a stop codon as most genes do, but instead has a stop codon created by the process of polyadenylation during mRNA processing. Due to this, TMEM247 has no 3' UTR (untranslated region). TMEM247 codes only for one variant. === Promoter region === The promoter region of TMEM247 has a huge variety of predicted binding sites in the promoter region associated with the gene. Twenty potential interactions of interest have been collected below, though many more exist. Anchor base positions are based on distance from the start of the gene's promoter region, which itself is 1302 base pairs long. There are a number of notable predicted binding sites on the TMEM247 promoter, as well as a notable omission. The promoter lacks a traditional TATA box, the typical binding site for proteins that recruit RNA Polymerase and begin the process of transcription. Instead, TMEM247 contains several predicted binding sites which are core promoter elements for TATA-less promoters. TMEM247 has a promoter region that also contains a significant number of predicted development-related binding sites, such as pluripotent stem cell related factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog), sex-determining HMG box factors, and various homeobox/homeodomain binding sites.Genomatix: Welcome to the Genomatix Software Suite!

Retrieved May 1, 2020, from https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway, These orthologs are exclusive to land-based animals, as clades with an evolutionary origin before reptiles are not represented. The fact that TMEM247 has no relatives before the green anole makes it likely that the gene was novel when it appeared in an ancestor of the species, and was nonexistent before the evolution of reptiles. Classes represented in the orthologs include mammalia, aves, and reptilia. Most orthologs within mammalia are strongly conserved across the entire gene, including a very highly conserved region near the center of the translated protein. The highest evolutionary conservation is centered around the transmembrane regions of the protein, which are highly conserved in all orthologous species.EMBOSS Needle\u2014Alignment. (n.d.).
