    "text": "Ljubinka Bobic (2 January 1897 \u2013 3 December 1978) was a Serbian actress. She appeared in more than fifteen films from 1951 to 1975. ==Biography== She was born in Kru\u0161evac in a poor family with five children. Her brother Miroljub Bobi\u0107, a teacher, is one of 1300 Corporals and a holder of Alban memorial. Her father, Vladislav, a cobbler, was from Srem (Sremski Golubinci), and her mother Jelisaveta was from Macedonia (Struga). They moved to Top\u010dider hill where Ljubinka grew up. Theatre attracted her and with her persistence she becomes a member of National theatre and dedicates her life to acting.. \"\u2026she didn\u2019t acknowledge old age, so she often lied about her actual age. She didn\u2019t care about being acknowledged, not even for big ones she received. She captivated everyone with her charisma, pleasant figure and, if needed, pleasant diction, and she scared everyone with her sharp tongue and the fact she could bring someone down to earth without any qualms. She often swore, and while this was true, her friends often admitted that swear words uttered by her sound charming. Like a true boem, she was a drinker and a smoker. She refused to allow her life be made into a book, because she claimed it would be \"a biography to laugh and cry at, so it would appear more as an anti- biography\". She never got married. She had affairs with the director of \"Politika\" newspaper Vlada Ribnikar, writer Milo\u0161 Crnjanski and Rade Drainac. She was buried in the Alley of deserving citizens on the New Graveyard in Belgrade. A stamp with her silhouette was published in 2003. \"Ljubinka Bobi\u0107\" award was established in 2006. ==Theatrical career== Her talent was discovered by Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107 while she was casting wistful looks in the direction of the theatre during the Big war in 1915 in Skoplje where she was sent by her family to live with her relatives. Thanks to him, she started out as an intern in National theatre of Skoplje. When her relatives informed her parents of this, her parents returned her to Belgrade where she continues the attendance of Women\u2019s worker school. Fate made her cross paths with Nu\u0161i\u0107 again, from whom she asks a recommendation for Zagreb theatre. Still, she chooses the National theatre in Belgrade, a member of which she becomes in 1920 and remains a member until she retires. She didn't act only during Second world war because she refused to make the audience laugh while her country was occupied. In the beginning, she acted as sentimental girls and mischievous boys. Her first big achievement was the role of Puck in \"Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\", followed by role of Fema in \"Pokondirena tikva\", Mrs. Mica in \"Authority\", Marica in \"Suspicious person\", son Raka of lady Minister, who was interpreted by \u017danka Stoki\u0107. Except in comedies, she interpreted the characters of Kata in \"Ko\u0161tana\", Hedviga in Ibsen\u2019s \"Wild duck\", Madlen Petrovna in Krle\u017ea\u2019s drama \"In agony\" and others. Along with \u017danka Stoki\u0107, she made a phenomenal interpretation of \u017divka in \"Minister lady\" written by Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107, which she acted out 265 times during her career \u2013 first time in 1964 when she was 67 and was retired, and last time when she was 81 on 8 November in 1978, less than a month before her death. ==Selected filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
