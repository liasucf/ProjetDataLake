    "text": "Trent University is a public liberal arts university in Peterborough, Ontario, with a satellite campus in Oshawa, which serves the Regional Municipality of Durham. Trent is known for its Oxbridge college system and small class sizes.\"Help choosing a university in Ontario\". The Globe and Mail, 22 October 2013 Erin Millar and Tari Ajadi Trent operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, Catharine Parr Traill, Otonabee, Peter Gzowski and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room, and student government. Although Trent University is predominantly undergraduate, graduate programs are offered at the master's and doctoral levels. Trent was founded through the efforts of a citizens' committee interested in creating a university to serve the City of Peterborough and the surrounding counties, and was created by the Trent University Act, 1962\u201363. The committee recruited Dean Thomas H. B. Symons of the University of Toronto to serve as chair of the academic planning committee and Symons became the university's first president. The Symons campus of Trent, named after founding president Thomas Symons, is located on the banks of the Otonabee River at the northeast corner of the City of Peterborough. The Symons campus plan and its original college buildings, including Champlain College, Lady Eaton College, Bata Library and the Faryon bridge which spans the Otonabee, were designed by Canadian architect Ron Thom. Close to 9 000 undergraduate students and nearly 700 graduate students are enrolled at the Peterborough campus while Trent University Durham GTA serves over 1 600 full- and part-time students at the campus on Thornton Road in Oshawa. The university is represented in Canadian Interuniversity Sport by the Trent Excalibur. == History == A view of the Faryon footbridge that connects the east and west parts of the college across the Otonabee River. Trent University resulted from a community discussion in 1957 about opening a post-secondary institution in the Trent Valley.\"Universities in Canada\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, P. Anisef, P. Axelrod, J. Lennards, 9 March 2012 The campaign for a post-secondary institution in Peterborough coincided with the Ontario government's policy of creating new universities and expanding existing institutions to respond to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1963 Trent University was founded as a non-denominational, public institution in downtown Peterborough, Ontario. It was established as a provincial university under the Trent University Act, 1962\u201363.\"Trent University\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, Robert D. Chambers 2 June 2012 In fall 1964, the university welcomed its first students, its campus consisting of three refurbished older buildings in central Peterborough: Rubidge Hall, Catherine Parr Traill College for women, and Peter Robinson College for men. The governor general, Georges Vanier, officially opened Trent University in 1964.Cole, A. O. C. Trent: The Making of a University, 1957-1987. Peterborough: Trent University, 1992. That year there were about 100 students attending the university.\"Trent University marks 50th anniversary of its opening\". Peterborough This Week, 18 October 2014 by Paul Rellinger Modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, Trent established a bicameral system consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens), exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. Canadian General Electric, a major industrial employer in Peterborough, donated a 100-acre parcel of land along the Otonabee River; other lands were subsequently acquired on both sides of the river to serve as the site of the university's permanent campus. The CGE donation included a functioning hydroelectric power plant dating from the 1890s, which still generates a substantial portion of the university's electricity and produces income for the university. The power plant underwent a $22.8-million upgrade in 2013; Trent University owns 50% of the power plant with Peterborough Utilities Group owning the remaining 50%. The university's Geography Department was set up in 1968, and in 1969 the university offered Canada's first Native Studies program.\"Trent University celebrates 50-year friendship with Curve Lake First Nation\". Anishinabek News, 18 September 2014 In 2017 Trent announced the Trent University Research & Innovation Park (since renamed to Cleantech Commons).\"Trent\u2019s new research park has this small university thinking big\" University Affairs, Mark Cardwell, 13 September 2017 That year the university enrolled about 3,500 new students.\"Trent University about to welcome almost 3,500 new students to Peterborough\".

It is the only Trent college situated in downtown Peterborough and is the oldest remaining college. It serves as the base for the undergraduate departments of English, Cultural Studies, Canadian Studies and Modern Languages. More than five graduate programs also call the college home including Public Texts (English); Theory, Culture and Politics; Cultural Studies; History; the Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies, Big Data Analytics and Financial Analytics. Traill College is also the home of Trent University's Continuing Education program. Traill College consists of Wallis Hall and Crawford Houses, which are residential; as well as Scott House \u2014 the original location of Catharine Parr Traill College \u2014 Kerr House, and Fry Lodge (formerly the Principal's Lodge), which is named after the college's first principal, Marion Fry. The university previously owned Bradburn and Langton Houses but both properties were sold to the Peterborough Housing Corporation in 2009.Galen Eagle. \"City gives permission to sell Langton House\" , Peterborough Examiner, 5 December 2011. The property was sold to Hospice Peterborough in 2012 and will to be turned into a residential hospice.Brendan Wedley. \"Planning committee approves zoning for 10-bed hospice in Langton House building\" , Peterborough Examiner, 23 May 2012. In fall 1999, an in-house task force recommended closing the college as a cost-saving measure, which led to a flurry of protest and a successful campaign to save Traill. In 2008, it was converted to a centre of graduate studies. In 2016, an external presidential review of the college was ordered. It recommended that Traill return to is roots as a more \"traditional\" college and expand its services and reach into the local community. ==== Champlain College ==== Located on Symons Campus along the Otonabee River, this college was opened in 1967. It is named after the early 17th century explorer Samuel de Champlain, who explored the Otonabee area in 1615 and founded Quebec City in 1608 and whose sword is featured in the Trent crest. It originally served as an all-male residence, along with Peter Robinson College. The college is home to the Political Studies department and the Trent University Alumni Association. ==== Lady Eaton College ==== The fourth college, established in 1968, it is named in honour of Flora McCrea Eaton, Lady Eaton. It contains the offices for the departments of History, Philosophy, Classics, Women's Studies, and Modern Languages. It originally served as the Female Dormitory. ==== Otonabee College ==== Trent University; a view across the Otonabee River, showing the west bank part of the campus, including Bata Library on the left. The Faryon bridge is to the right. Otonabee College was founded in 1972. The buildings of Otonabee range along a cedar ridge overlooking the river from which the College derives its name (\"fast water\" in Nishnaabee). To the east of the College are located the new buildings of the DNA Cluster and the Forensic Science program. To the west are Peter Gzowski College and the Science buildings, leading to the Faryon pedestrian bridge, which provides access to the Bata Library, the Athletics Complex, and the colleges on the West Bank. Eight \"houses\" connected by an interior walkway called \"the Link\", make up Otonabee's residence. The residence is co-educational, although there are single-sex areas within the houses. Past \"the Link\" (a path leading to the instructional area of the College which bisects the residences), are a set of faculty offices, the mailboxes, College Porter's office, and the main dining hall looking to the north and east of the grounds. The academic wing is directly connected with the Science Buildings and houses the School of Education, the departments of Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, and Computing & Information Systems. Teaching facilities include a 125-seat lecture theatre, various seminar rooms, laboratories for Anthropology and Psychology and Computer Science, and a Sociology resource room, offices for faculty in many of the disciplines in arts and sciences, and the Wenjack Theatre, which provides a venue for multimedia lecture presentations as well as theatrical productions by amateur and professional companies. Nearby are the Archaeology Centre, Mackenzie House, and a wildlife sanctuary with walks and ski trails. Students at Otonabee play a major role in organizing and conducting cultural, social and athletic activities. The student government (Cabinet) and its committees cooperate with the College Office and dons in planning and delivering a variety of events for both its non-resident and resident members: visiting scholars, artists, musicians, scientists; College dinners and dances; Fall and Winter College Weekend; and intramural co-educational competitions in a number of sports. ==== Peter Gzowski College ==== Founded in 2003, it is the newest of the Trent University colleges, named for CBC broadcaster Peter Gzowski, who was Trent's 8th chancellor. At one point the college had two campuses: on Peterborough's Argyle Street in buildings leased from the Eastern Pentecostal Bible College, now Master's College and Seminary, which housed the Teacher Education and Nursing programs; and the Enwayaang building on the main Symons campus. (\"Enwayaang\" means \"the way we speak together\" in the Anishinaabe language.) Enwayaang housed the Indigenous Studies, Economics, Mathematics and Business Administration programs. Programs at the Argyle location were moved to Enwayaang prior to the 2006\u20132007 academic year. ==== Peter Robinson College ==== The first college to open at the university, it was dedicated to Peter Robinson, the member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada who oversaw migration of Irish settlers to the area in the 1820s. The college used to have a residence (apartment style) until its sale to a private landlord in 2004. The college was shut down by the university administration, against the protests of many Peter Robinson students and faculty.http://www.sadleirhouse.ca/timeline By referendum in March 2003, Trent students voted to create and operate a non-profit educational and cultural student facility, to be shared with the community as a whole. Chosen to house this new facility was Sadleir House: one of the original university buildings at the PR site, it holds special historical significance for both the Trent and Peterborough communities. Funded by a new student levy and organized as the P.R. Community and Student Association (PRCSA), the students' offer to purchase the property was accepted by the current non-university owners. The Trust secured a mortgage for the property and the students took possession of Sadleir House on 27 February 2004. Currently, each student pays a levy fee each year of over $25 to support the mortgage on the house. Among other things, Sadleir House contains the offices of the Arthur, the Trent student newspaper, and the Sadleir House Alternative Library. ==== Julian Blackburn College ==== This college offered programs for part-time students in Peterborough until 2011. It is named after Julian Blackburn, one of the original professors who helped establish Trent. It is now home to Trent's administration, as well as medical, counselling, printing, parking, registrar, financial aid, student affairs, student accounts, and several other important university services. == Trent University Durham GTA == Trent's Durham GTA campus in the Regional Municipality of Durham has been offering courses for over 40 years, initially in classrooms rented from Eastwood Collegiate and Vocational Institute.
