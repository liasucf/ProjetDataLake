    "text": "The fourth season of Veronica Mars, an American drama television series created by Rob Thomas, consists of eight episodes that were all released on Hulu on July 19, 2019. It serves as a continuation of the 2004\u201307 television series as well as the 2014 film. Kristen Bell reprises her role as the title character, and it features the return of several characters from the original series as well as the introduction of new characters. ==Production and development== On August 21, 2018, it was reported that Hulu was planning an eight-episode revival of Veronica Mars with Kristen Bell returning in the title role and series creator Rob Thomas returning as well. On September 6, 2018, it was reported that production would begin in October 2018 and continue through March 2019 in Los Angeles. Diane Ruggiero-Wright and Dan Etheridge returned as executive producers. On September 20, 2018, Hulu officially confirmed the revival, and announced it would premiere in 2019. The season was originally scheduled for release on July 26, 2019, however, during the series' appearance at San Diego Comic-Con on July 19, it was announced that season would be available that day. Along with Thomas and Ruggiero, the writing staff consists of Heather V. Regnier, David Walpert, Raymond Obstfeld, and former NBA player and author Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bell stated that the season was going to be darker and bigger and more cinematic, a little bit different\" in comparison to the original series. Thomas stated the season takes place five years after the film and would \"take Veronica Mars back to its hardcore So-Cal noir roots\" and that it is \"One big case [...] This is a detective show.\" The revival features a new version of the original theme song, \"We Used to Be Friends\" by The Dandy Warhols, covered by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders. ==Plot== Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) and her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni) are private investigators in Neptune, California, a popular spring break vacation destination. Real estate developer Richard \"Big Dick\" Casablancas (David Starzyk) campaigns for the enactment of city beautification laws; local business owners protest the likely expense of complying with such laws. Meanwhile, Veronica rejects a marriage proposal from her longtime boyfriend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring). When a beachside motel is bombed, the Marses are hired to investigate by Congressman Daniel Maloof (Mido Hamada), whose brother's fianc\u00e9e was killed in the explosion. A Mexican crime boss, whose nephew was another victim, sends two assassins, Alonzo (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dodie (Frank Gallegos), to find and kill the bomber. Injured in the blast is Penn Epner (Patton Oswalt), a true crime enthusiast, who seizes the spotlight to accuse Maloof of the crime. The late motel owner's daughter, Matty Ross (Izabela Vidovic), investigates on her own; Veronica eventually takes her under her wing to supervise her. Veronica also befriends nightclub owner Nicole Malloy (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), and occasionally consults with Penn and his club of amateur crime-solvers. Their investigation implicates a local ex-con, who apparently commits suicide before he can be arrested. However, after his death, three more bombs explode in Neptune over several days. The Marses uncover evidence that Casablancas's fixer Clyde Pickett (J. K. Simmons) has been hiring the local juvenile delinquents, organized by Veronica's former friend Eli \"Weevil\" Navarro (Francis Capra), to mug spring break visitors, driving away tourism; Casablancas is then able to buy beachfront property cheaply, planning to redevelop the land for more upscale businesses. Veronica's ex-boyfriend Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield), an FBI agent, arrives to investigate the case. His rekindled flirtation with Veronica eventually makes her realize how much she values her relationship with Logan. She loses her friendship with Nicole when she confesses to considering Nicole a suspect in the case and bugging her office, and decides to accept Logan's proposal. The Marses eventually conclude that Casablancas was responsible for the bomb at the motel, but the subsequent bombs were the work of a copycat. Casablancas is murdered by Alonzo and Dodie after Clyde tips them off to his guilt. The Marses arrest Penn as the copycat, but he hires them to prove his own innocence. Evidence is uncovered which briefly implicates Penn's fellow amateur crime-solver Don (Clark Duke), but Matty spots that the evidence has been tampered with: Penn was the copycat bomber all along, out for glory and attention. The Marses deduce the site of the next bomb, and Keith disarms the bomb with seconds to spare; but Penn gloats to Veronica as he is being arrested. Veronica and Logan are married that day. But a few hours later, Veronica's car explodes, killing Logan \u2014 one last bomb that Penn had set earlier. The next year, when Neptune is fully gentrified and spring break tourism is a thing of the past, Veronica leaves Neptune to solve cases on the road. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars, a private investigator * Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars, Veronica's father and a PI * Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls, Veronica's boyfriend and a Naval Intelligence Officer ===Starring=== * Francis Capra as Eli \"Weevil\" Navarro, leader of the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang * Clifton Collins Jr. as Alonzo Lozano, a mid-level hitman for a Mexican cartel * Percy Daggs III as Wallace Fennel, Veronica's best friend, a high school physics teacher and varsity coach who is now married with a child * Frank Gallegos as Dodie Mendoza, Alonzo's crime partner * Max Greenfield as Leo D'Amato, an FBI agent and former boyfriend of Veronica * Mido Hamada as Daniel Maloof, a Congressman * Ryan Hansen as Dick Casablancas, Logan's friend and now a movie actor * Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Nicole Malloy, the owner of a Neptune nightclub * Dawnn Lewis as Marcia Langdon, the new police chief of Neptune * Patton Oswalt as Penn Epner, a pizza delivery guy and true crime enthusiast who runs a websleuth group called \"Murder Heads\" * David Starzyk as Richard Casablancas, Dick's father and wealthy businessman who is a suspect of the bombings * Izabela Vidovic as Matty Ross, a teenager who loses her father in one of the bombings * Jacqueline Antaramian as Amalia Maloof, Daniel's mother * Paul Karmiryan as Alex Maloof, Daniel's younger brother * J.
