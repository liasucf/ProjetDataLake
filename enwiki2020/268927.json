    "text": "Jacob Johan Anckarstr\u00f6m (11 May 1762 \u2013 27 April 1792) was a Swedish military officer who assassinated Gustav III, king of Sweden. He was convicted and executed for regicide. ==Life== He was the son of Jacob Johan Anckarstr\u00f6m the Elder and Hedvig Ulrika Drufva. He married Gustaviana Elisabet L\u00f6wen (1764-1844) in 1783, and had two daughters and two sons: Gustafva Eleonora L\u00f6wenstr\u00f6m (1785-1860), Carolina Lovisa, Johan Jacob and Carl David. Anckarstr\u00f6m served as a page at court and then as a captain in King Gustav III's regiment between 1778 and 1783. During travels to Gotland, he was accused of slandering the king and fled to Stockholm, where he spent the winter; he was subsequently arrested, brought back, and tried in Gotland. Although he was acquitted due to lack of evidence, he later maintained in his confession that this incident sparked his fire of hatred towards the king, fuelled by the contemporary revolutionary movement in Europe. Drawing of Anckarstr\u00f6m being flogged thumb The Swedish nobles were about this time violently opposed to the king, who, by the aid of the other orders of the state, had wrested their power from them and was now ruling despotically. This dislike was increased by the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1789 and by the king's known desire to interfere in favor of Louis XVIII in France. Anckarstr\u00f6m, a man of strong passions and violent temper, resolved upon the assassination of Gustav and communicated his intention to other disaffected nobles, including Counts Horn and Ribbing. Initial attempts to seize the king were failures. ===The murder=== On 16 March 1792, Gustav III had returned to Stockholm, after spending the day at Haga Palace outside the city, to dine and visit a masquerade ball at the Royal Opera. During dinner, the king received an anonymous letter (written by the colonel of the Life Guards, Carl Pontus Lilliehorn) that contained a threat to his life, but as the king had received numerous threatening letters in the past, he chose to ignore the warning. After dining, the king with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen at his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The king, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor towards the scene where several dancers and masked men filled the tiles. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the king, who then turned backwards to talk to Pollet. Anckarstr\u00f6m stood at the entrance to the corridor and edged himself behind the king, took out a pistol from his left inner pocket and pulled the trigger. Because of the king turning backwards the shot went in at an angle left of the third lumbar vertebrae towards the left hip region. The shot consisted of two bullets, furniture tacks and bits of lead clippings; Anckarstr\u00f6m later confessed that the composition of the shot was intended to be as lethal as possible.High Court protocols, 1792 The king twitched and said \u201cai\u201d without falling. Anckarstr\u00f6m then lost courage; he had thought that the king would fall directly. Bewildered, Anckarstr\u00f6m dropped the pistol and knife on the floor, took a few steps and shouted fire. He quickly went towards the entrance, but the guard had already closed the doors. Despondent, he hid his second pistol and mixed with the crowd. His intention had been to shoot himself with the second pistol. Witnesses told the court that Anckarstr\u00f6m had been agitated and asked if the king was badly wounded. All guests at the masquerade were forced to give their names before leaving the house.High Court protocols, 1792 In the 19th Century the history of the assassination was embellished upon, embellishments that still are taken as facts today.Anon., 1844Elkan, 1910Lindqvist, 2000 Most notably is the tale of how one of the conspirators (often Claes Fredrik Horn) taps the king on the shoulder and saying \u201cbonsoir, beau masque\u201d (Good evening, beautiful masque) to point out Anckarstr\u00f6m's target. The other embellishment would be that the king was shot at a certain point in a counter dance, \u201cPlaisir de Gr\u00f6ns\u00f6\u00f6\u201d. The conductor, so the legend goes, marked the sound of the shot in his notes and the music stopped. But the court records show that few people noticed the shot and the music continued playing for some time afterwards.Sv\u00e4rdstr\u00f6m, 1967 Anckarstr\u00f6m's pistols, legend aside, were brought around to several gunsmiths the next morning and one who had repaired them for Anckarstr\u00f6m recognized them and identified him as their owner. Anckarstr\u00f6m was arrested the same morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until he was informed that Horn and Ribbing had been arrested and confessed in full.High Court protocols, 1792 Anckarstr\u00f6m was jailed in a prison not far from the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Today the former prison is an underground restaurant named after the viceroy Sten Sture. Curiously, the murder had been predicted to the king four years earlier, when he paid an anonymous visit to the celebrated medium of the Gustavian era, Ulrica Arfvidsson. She was often employed by his brother, Duke Charles, and was said to have a large net of informers all over town; she was never suspected to be involved, but she was questioned about the murder. In 1791, Charlotta Roos also predicted misfortune to King Gustav III, something he reportedly referred to on his death bed after the assassination. ===Execution=== Gustav III died of his wounds on 29 March and on 16 April Anckarstr\u00f6m was sentenced. He was stripped of his estates and nobility privileges. He was sentenced to be cast in irons for three days and publicly flogged, his right hand to be cut off, his head removed, and his corpse quartered. The execution took place on 27 April 1792. He endured his sufferings with the greatest fortitude, and seemed to rejoice in having rid his country of a tyrant. His principal accomplices Ribbing and Horn were stripped of titles and estates and expelled from the country.Hig Court protocols, 1792 ===Aftermath=== In the same year, the Anckarstr\u00f6m family changed its surname to L\u00f6wenstr\u00f6m and donated funds for a hospital as a gift of appeasement. This resulted in the L\u00f6wenstr\u00f6m Hospital, or L\u00f6wenstr\u00f6mska lasarettet in Upplands V\u00e4sby north of Stockholm. Living descendants of Anckarstr\u00f6m include Ulf Adelsohn, and solo sailor Sven Yrvind. ==Operas== Anckarstr\u00f6m is a character in Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III and Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (A Masked Ball). In the operas, his motivation is changed to jealousy over his wife Amelia, with whom Gustav is portrayed as being in love. He is actually portrayed as being Gustav's close friend before he switches allegiances. Gustav pardons him with his last breath. In the censored version of the Verdi libretto, set in Colonial-era Boston, he is called Renato (Rene). == References == ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * .
