Between 2004 and 2006, Hook expanded eastwards with the development of the Holt Park residential district, and from 2020 northeastwards with the Green Hart Park and Oakwood Grange developments. == History == Until the 18th century, only a few scattered farms could be found in the area; small hamlets did not begin to appear until inns sprung up to serve travellers. Hook was located on the main London to Exeter stagecoach route. In the late eighteenth century, a turnpike road was constructed to aid the navigation of the steep Scures Hill, to the west of the village. In 1883 Hook railway station was constructed, and the village began to grow with railway workers and commuters settling in Hook.\"History of Hook\" Hook Parish Council Website === Early-Mid 20th century === St John the Evangelist Parish Church was completed in 1938 replacing the tin tabernacle used by worshippers since 1886. The new Church was designed by Edward Maufe and shows in small scale design features that would later be incorporated by him into Guildford Cathedral. Even the Cathedral fund raising scheme of \"buying a brick\" was first utilised at Hook where the Church retains an impressive list of donors and benefactors. Hook also has a Roman Catholic church and an Evangelical Church. The latter now known as Life Church was originally paid for by the family who founded Burberry; founder Thomas Burberry being a Baptist who died in Hook.

Recently, the town has grown in size considerably with new housing developments being constructed. Although within of the far larger town of Basingstoke to the west, Hook's development since the 1980s has been rapid. Calls have been made to redevelop the 'village' centre as Hook has few amenities for its size, as it is now generally considered as a town in terms of population and urban expanse. Affluence is high due to surrounding rural areas, estates, such as Tylney Hall Park and Garden Tylney Hall Park and Garden which is Grade II* listed and Hook Common, a large mixture of forest and heathland coupled with excellent transport links. == Transport == Hook has one of the few national TaxiBus services.
