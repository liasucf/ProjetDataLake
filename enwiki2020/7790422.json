    "text": "Pongwe Pogwe is a Tanzanian village belonging to the ward of Kang'ata, Handeni District in the northern Region of Tanga. The local demonym is \"Wapongwe\" (\"Samwepongwe\" for men and \"Mnamweponge\" for women). ==Geography== In Pongwe Pogwe there is a natural spring water place called Kwekibaya. Kwekibaya is the only source of water for thousands of people and animals. ==History== ===Cultural beliefs=== It is believed that if a person not belonging to Wapongwe cleans the water source (the place where water is actually coming out to the surface), Kwekibaya dries out. If this happens, it is only a Wapongwe family member, in Wagongwe tradition, who can please the natural spring to give out water again. Because of the importance of Kwekibaya, there is a chain of family leaders among the Wapongwe who guide the community in managing the Kibaya in partuicular and general resources such as deforestation issues (which forest is a reserved one). The last leader of wapongwe is Mkulago (1942-2006). Mkulago died on 28 April 2006 and laid to rest on 30 April 2006 in the Mtonga forest. ==References== Category:Populated places in Tanga Region ",
