He also is the main shareholder of the football team. == Biography == Born in 1963 in Madrid, he is the second son of Jes\u00fas Gil y Gil, former President of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (1987\u20132003) and Mayor of Marbella (1991\u20132002), and Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Mar\u00edn Cobo. Graduated as veterinarian, his father gave him control over the Valdeolivas property in Arenas de San Pedro near the Sierra de Gredos, known as location for horse breeding. In time, Gil Mar\u00edn developed a business conglomerate dedicated to horse and bull breeding as well as hunting activities, with businesses in both Valdeolivas (10 km2) and the Finca El Arco (2.5 km2) in the province of Toledo. His father also introduced him to administration of the Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid football team, with Gil Mar\u00edn becoming the CEO in 1993. Since 2004, as Jes\u00fas Gil died, he also became the owner of the majority of shares along Enrique Cerezo, who became Chairman of the company. As the conversion from football club into a Sociedad An\u00f3nima Deportiva (SAD) in the 1990s was ruled as a case of embezzlement (\"unlawful appropiation\") by justice (although the Supreme Court suspended the two-year prison sentence to Gil Mar\u00edn and Cerezo as well as the restitution of shares in 2004 on the basis of the extinction of the charges after 5 years), the property over the shares remains controversial. Gil Mar\u00edn lives in the exclusive La Finca in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n; as of 2019, his fortune was estimated as the 192nd in Spain. == Awards == * 2010 \u2013 Globe Soccer Awards (Best director of the year) == References == Category:Spanish sports executives and administrators Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Category:1963 births Category:Spanish cattlemen Category:Living people ",
