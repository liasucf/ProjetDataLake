She has served as president of Femmes autochtones du Qu\u00e9bec (Quebec Native Women) and the Native Women's Association of Canada. She served from 2004 through 2008 as Associate Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Relations with Citizens and Immigration of the Quebec government, where she was in charge of the Secretariat for Women. In 2017, she was appointed as one of the five commissioners of the government's national inquiry: Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. == Life == Audette's mother was returning to Schefferville by train when she unexpectedly went into labour. The train stopped and her mother was airlifted by helicopter to the nearest hospital, in Wabush, Labrador, where Audette was born. She grew up in Schefferville, Maliotenam, and Montreal. Her mother, Evelyne St-Onge, is Innu and her father, Gilles Audette, is French-Canadian from Montreal. The family was denied a house on her mother's reserve under federal law because her mother married a non-Native man. St-Onge was a co-founder of Quebec Native Women (FAQ), which fought against the clause in the federal Indian Act that stated that a Native woman who marries a non-Native man did not have the right to live in her reserve community. Native men who marry non-Native women do not suffer such restrictions. As Audette grew up, she too became an activist in indigenous affairs. She worked to raise awareness and gain government action on the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. She served as president of Femmes autochtones du Qu\u00e9bec (FAQ), then led the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). She also acted in one of the short film vignettes on Canadian history known as Heritage Minutes as a member of an Attikamek family teaching early French settlers how to make maple syrup. Audette was appointed as Associate Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Relations with Citizens and Immigration Quebec government, in charge of the Secretariat for Women, serving from 2004 through 2008. She has conducted public relations for and acted as coordinator of many festivals. She has also worked as a researcher for Aboriginal Nations, a news magazine broadcast on T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec. In 2017, Audette was appointed as one of five commissioners to the national inquiry: Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. ===Electoral politics=== Some years after her first government service, Audette decided to enter electoral politics.
