    "text": "The Krasukha (; English: Belladonna or Deadly Nightshade) is a Russian mobile, ground-based, electronic warfare (EW) system. This system is produced by the KRET corporation on different wheeled platforms. The Krasukha's primary targets are airborne radio-electronics (such as UAVs) and airborne systems guided by radar. The Krasukha has multiple applications in the Russian Armed Forces. ==Krasukha-2== The Krasukha-2 is intended to jam AWACS at ranges of up to . The Krasukha-2 is also able to jam other airborne radars, such as radar guided missiles. The missiles, once jammed, are then provided a false target away from the original to ensure that the missiles are no longer a threat. The Krasukha-2 guards mobile high priority targets such as the 9K720 Iskander SRBM. ==Krasukha-4== The Krasukha-4 broadband multifunctional jamming station is mounted on a BAZ-6910-022 four-axle-chassis. Like the Krasukha-2, the Krasukha-4 counters AWACS and other airborne radar systems. The Krasukha-4 has the range effectively to disrupt low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and can cause permanent damage to targeted radio-electronic devices. Ground based radars are also a viable target for the Krasukha-4. ==Operators== * ** Russian Ground Forces * * * ** Libyan National Army ==Operational history== Krasukha jammers were reportedly deployed to support Russian forces in Syria. They have reportedly been blocking small U.S. surveillance drones from receiving GPS satellite signals. In July 2018, an OSCE monitoring mission drone recorded a 1L269 Krasukha-2 among other electronic warfare equipment deployed near Chornukhyne, Ukraine. ==References== Category:Military electronics of Russia Category:Electronic warfare Category:Military vehicles of Russia Category:Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies Category:Electronic warfare equipment Category:Modern military equipment of Russia ",
