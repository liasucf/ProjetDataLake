    "text": "The MEI HELLHOUND 40 mm Low Velocity Multi-Purpose Grenade is a fixed type ammunition designed to be fired from a 40 mm Grenade Launcher such as the M79, M203, M320 (attached to the M16 series of rifles or M4 carbine), or Milkor MK-1. The round consists of an A5 filled metal projectile body with a rotating band, a point initiating-base detonating fuze with Safe and Arm technology, and a cartridge case assembly. Upon impact with the target, the firing pin is driven into the detonator, which in turn initiates the spit backcharge, producing a jet which initiates the explosive train from the base forward, resulting in an armor-piercing jet of molten metal and fragmentation of the projectile body. The MEI Hellhound uses the same High-Low Propulsion System as other popular 40mm grenade launchers, which keeps the recoil forces in bounds for an infantry small arm. == Technical Information == * Type: High-explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) * Manufacturer: Martin Electronics, Inc.
