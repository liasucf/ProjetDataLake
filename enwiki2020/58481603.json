The Chanel ready-to-wear collection is showcased biannually for spring-summer and autumn-winter seasons during Paris Fashion Week to an audience of media, retailers, buyers, investors, and customers, under the auspices of the Chambre Syndicale du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode, which is one of three trade associations affiliated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de la couture, du pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter des couturiers et des cr\u00e9ateurs de mode. The House of Chanel is known for liberating women from the corset in the early 20th century and designing fluid, jersey pieces, most notably the little black dress. Chanel died in 1971, Karl Lagerfeld served as Creative Director from 1983 until his death in 2019. Virginie Viard, Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s longtime collaborator for more than three decades, succeeded him as Creative Director. Viard has a background in costume design and presented her first solo collection in May 2019 for Chanel\u2019s Cruise 2020 Collection. == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2012 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2012 Runway Show was presented on October 4, 2011 at the Grand Palais in Paris. With a massive seascape production, which Vogue described as spectacular and risk-taking, Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld unveiled 84 new looks with unconstructed jackets, cutaway backs, ostrich feather skirts, and sequined dresses in a lighter, iridescent palette of whites, creams, nudes, and metallics that shifted to pinks, corals, and blacks. For a sportier element, Lagerfeld added drawstring waists and bomber jackets. The collection featured a variety of fabrics ranging from tweed, organza, lace, chiffon and lam\u00e9 to knit, silk, and leather. With a slight 1920s influence, design details included drop-waists, pearl belts, seaweed panniers, boxy tweed jackets, and ruffles that mimicked sea sponges. There were also aquatic-themed accessories with handbags, shoes, and jewelry shaped as seashells, conch shells, and coral. The production included stylized, oversized installations of giant sea life sculptures: stingray, sea horse, shark, anemone, and coral branches in a variety of matte, glossy, and sparkly finishes. Florence Welch provided the soundtrack with a live performance of \"What the Water Gave Me.\" Saskia de Brauw opened the runway show.

Uma Thurman, Anna Dello Russo, Alexa Chung, Jared Leto, Vanessa Traina, Ines de la Fressange, Sean Lennon, and Carine Roitfeld attended the show and were photographed on the front row. Fashion Critic Tim Blanks described the runway presentation as \"a magical underwater environment.\" Following the October 4, 2011 presentation, Blanks asked Lagerfeld at what point did the theme of the undersea world assert itself on the collection. Lagerfeld replied, \"Nothing is more modern than the shapes in the ground of the sea who have billions of years. The sea is the same all over the world; so it's a manualization in a very modern, graphic way\u2014and where pollution hadn't reached yet.\" Blanks noted the paradoxical metaphor of creating something very modern out of something very old. \"I'm happy you say that,\" noted Lagerfeld. \"In fact, the oldest things are the most modern in a way.\" == Chanel Ready-to- Wear Fall 2012 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2012 Runway Show was presented on March 5, 2012 at the Grand Palais in Paris. Vogue Runway described the runway set as the Fortress of Solitude. Karl Lagerfeld transitioned from the depths of the ocean to the center of the Earth with 68 new looks. The presentation's featured silhouette focused on a three-piece ensemble of jacket, shirt, and pants. The collection's dichotic inspiration sources were mineralogical and cubist. Embroidered crystals along the hemlines and cuffs referenced the former influence, while color-blocking and the angularity of the design details evoked the latter. Even the models' eyebrows were embellished by the couture embroidery house, Maison Lesage.

Michel Gaubert provided the runway soundtrack. Kati Nescher opened the runway show.

Vogue Italia Editor in Chief, Franca Sozzani remarked of the collection, \"It's so different from anyone, because it makes you feel like you're dreaming, but at the same time, you know that you could wear.\" When characterizing the runway design to Blanks, Lagerfeld said, \"What is more modern? This looks like a city of skyscrapers that has exploded, in a way\u2014so I think, nature is not such a bad designer, no? And the other inspiration in terms of cuts and shapes and embroideries is Czech cubism. I thought it was an interesting expression.\" == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2013 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2013 Runway Show was presented on October 1, 2012 at the Grand Palais in Paris. Vogue Runway described the set as having an architectural modernism. With an installation of 13 oversized wind turbines and solar panels across the length of the catwalk signifying a message of sustainable energy, Lagerfeld unveiled 80 new looks. The set was designed to underscore the collection's theme of ease and serenity. This season's featured silhouette statements were boleros and A-line skirts, dresses, and jackets. The creative director used three-dimensional chiffon cut-outs to create more lightness, volume, and movement. He eschewed his typical use of braids, buttons, and chains in favor of a more liberal placement of pearl embellishments for a look that he described to WWD as fresh and light, with different proportions and volumes. Lagerfeld, who is approaching his 30th anniversary as Creative Director of Chanel, continues to modernize the house, without reinventing its core aesthetic. This season, he showed cropped jackets, cocoon shapes, trapeze cuts, bell sleeves, wide-cut jackets, skirt- dresses, embroidered flowers, and organza pinwheels. Kati Nescher opened the runway show.

Everything is airy.\" When asked if this was the biggest thing he'd ever done, in terms of the production scale, the designer responded, \"I don't judge my things in terms of size. Energy is the most important thing in life. The rest comes later.\" == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2013 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2013 Runway Show was presented on March 4, 2013 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

I love how he is always able to take history and meld it with the future in the most beautiful, sensible way.\" As told to Style.com, Lagerfeld noted of his collection, \"It was dark, but I don't think it was sad. It's not easy to run around in pink all day. It's a very cosmopolitan, international look. It's a global look women can wear all over the world\u2026 An interesting thing is that today it's not that Europe, as big as the amount of shops, it's the rest of the world, it's the new world. And that's very interesting, because French luxury industry survives doing so well because there are all of those new fortunes in a new part of the world. And this is something I wanted to show too, that they see all the flags there in this new world\u2026 It's globalization, a fashion globalization.\" == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2014 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Spring 2014 Runway Show was presented on September 30, 2013 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

When asked about the art installation, Lagerfeld replied, \"I designed it. I made small models, and then they make it bigger. Yes, I made everything. It's not different young artists; only one old artist\u2014it's me\u2026 And I think it was right for today, no? Because life is not a red carpet. This is for daily life; that was the idea in fact.\" == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2014 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2014 Runway Show was presented on March 3, 2014 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Most outfits were layered over leggings. Corseted waistlines and knee-length skirts were paired with trapeze coats.

I feel like I could wear everything in the collection.\" \"We saw the punk girl.

The production was a 130-meter-long catwalk set as Boulevard Chanel staging a fashion protest. Lagerfeld's team recreated an urban cityscape with building facades, wrought-iron terraces, pavements, and puddles. This season's underlying theme was female empowerment. This was a collection about individuality and self-expression, which is why there were so many mix and match pieces. This feminine fashion expressionism was that women should be able to dress exactly how they want.

And also, there are all kinds of pieces; everybody can use, play with. It's not professional\u2026 There are no 70s, no 60s\u2014it's more of a Mod de Viv than mod.\" W Magazine's Editor-in-Chief Stefano Tonchi said of the presentation, \"Karl is such a great social commentator. It's true that fashion is supposed to be the mirror of society, but he really put the mirror on our faces and he reflects the feeling and the mood and the ideas that people have in their mind. == Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2015 Runway Show == The Chanel Ready-to-Wear Fall 2015 Runway Show was presented on March 10, 2015 at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Last time we had the demonstration in the streets that belonged to us. Now we have the French brasserie, and it moves me in a way. It's like my cultural roots that come out.\" \"The whole brasserie side was lovely because it is like being at my corner cafe and the feeling of being very French\u2026 And there were loads of tweeds and silhouettes that reminded me of France, reminded me of the 1960s in France and this whole culture of cafes at the time.\" said Lou Doillon. \"I'm a stranger so I have a distorted view on French life, because you know I'm a little tired also of people saying 'Oh France isn't good anymore.' Even the French, the famous French-bashing\u2014so I wanted to show that are few things are not that bad and typically French, and they should enjoy what they have,\" Lagerfeld added. \"The minute I finish one, I have to think about the next one, eh? That's why so many designers think the speed is too big and I don't think so.

Monikered by Vogue Runway as the \u201cC-side,\u201d the Spring 2019 Ready-to-Wear collection was set against a backdrop of a tropical beachside runway,complete with a tiki hut and mini boardwalk. Transitioning from previous seasons of forests and waterfalls, this season\u2019s Chanel beachscape featured sand, turf, waves, and lifeguards. For those concerned about the lavishness or potential waste of the production, the program notes assured guests that the water used to create the 25 centimeter depth and 131 x 32 meter surface would be \u201creprocessed via the common sewage system operated by Eau de Paris,\u201d while every grain of sand would be \u201cput back into the usual circuit of the construction industry, for which it was initially intended.\u201d The production design was said to be reminiscent of Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s childhood holidays on the island of Sylt. As reported by Vogue Italia, \u201cIt is the beach of one of my favourite places\u2014nothing is going on there\u2014 no boats because the sea is too rough,\u201d Lagerfeld explained. \u201cI went as a child \u2013 and back once for a campaign with Claudia Schiffer and Shalom Harlow,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the least polluted place on earth in the middle of the North Sea\u2014in my childhood you had to take little fishing boats to go over. But the same landscape changes every day\u2014the dunes move with the wind.\u201d As told to WWD, Poppy Delevingne said post-show. \u201cIt was like going to the most glamorous beach party of all time.\u201d She continued, \u201cI loved all the pastel colors, all the tweeds, all the raffia hats and sandals. I loved all the models barefoot, I loved all the sunshine-y looks,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve just taken a holiday, so \u2018thank you, Karl.\u2019\u201d The collection of 82 pastel looks in shades of mint, yellow, white, and pink, referenced late 1980s and early 1990s with oversized blazers and bike shorts.

For evening, tiered dresses and skirts were constructed of chiffon, organza, and feathers. Stripes, checks, and color blocking were featured in a palette of red, orange, pink, blue, black, and white. Many critics noted Viard\u2019s desire to stay true to the brand\u2019s iconic, signature tweeds and Lagerfeld\u2019s grand production values, while injecting her sense of wit and youthfulness, reinterpreting the tweed suit as a romper for spring and pairing metallic shorts with camellia-laden jackets. As told to the Italian Bureau of Fashion Network by Bruno Pavlovsky, President of Fashion at Chanel, \u201cIt\u2019s a collection that is the image of Virginie, very young, full of energy. It especially highlights her exceptional knowledge of the brand; 30 years with Karl; a perfect understanding of Mademoiselle Chanel\u2019s contribution and in addition her own inspiration.\u201d According to Vogue, Viard drew inspiration from the French New Wave Cinema of the 1950s and 1960s or the atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague. She cited Brand Ambassador Kristen Stewart\u2019s biopic Seberg, along with Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Breathless as reference points. Notably, French Youtuber and comediene Marie Benoliel caused a stir, by crashing the presentation, when she jumped up onto the runway from the audience. She was promptly escorted off the runway by Gigi Hadid. Virginie Ledoyen, Caroline de Maigret, Aiysha Hart, Sebastien Tellier, Ines de la Fressange, Isabelle Adjani, Sting, Trudie Styler, Soo Joo Park, and Cardi B attended the runway presentation. Fashionista noted the brand\u2019s inclusivity with model casting. Maike Inga opened the runway presentation of 83 looks, while Rianne van Rompaey closed it. Sacha Quenby, Anna Ewers, Jing Wen, Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Lexi Boling, Felice Noordhoff, Sara Grace Wallerstedt, and Vittoria Ceretti also walked the show. Hubert Barrere, Artistic Director of Lesage, also observed. \u201cYou know that with Virginie, everything is simple and obvious. I think that\u2019s maybe the message of this collection. Simpler, less fuss-one fabric that we can texturize, make lighter, more flexible, maybe even a bit more shiny, like the zinc roofs of Paris and the like lights of Paris and that simply makes everyone dream.\u201d == References == Category:Chanel ",
