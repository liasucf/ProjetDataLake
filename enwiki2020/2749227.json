    "text": "Hungarian folk music () includes a broad array of Central European styles, including the recruitment dance verbunkos, the cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s and n\u00f3ta. The name N\u00e9pzene is also used for Hungarian folk music as an umbrella designation of a number of related styles of traditional folk music from Hungary and Hungarian minorities living in modern-day Austria, the, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, central Romania (Transylvania) (Sz\u00e9kely), Moldova (Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3), and Serbia. The obscure origins of Hungarian folk music formed among the peasant population in the early nineteenth century with roots dating even further back. However, its broader popularity was largely due to the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, who in 1846 began composing 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies for piano, five of which were later orchestrated, thus being the first pieces of music by a major composer to incorporate sources from so-called \u201cpeasant music\u201d. These works, which broke free from classical tradition, were often viewed by the elite as brash and unrefined, yet they deeply influenced others, like Johannes Brahms, and later Zolt\u00e1n Kodaly and B\u00e9la Bartok, even having an influence on American jazz. During the 20th century, Hungarian composers were influenced by the traditional music of their nation which may be considered as a repeat of the early \"nationalist\" movement of the early 19th century (Beethoven) but is more accurately the artists' desire to escape the hegemony of the classical tradition manifold at that time. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k took this departure into the abstract musical world in his appropriation of traditional Hungarian as the basis for symphonic creations. Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k studied over 300 melodies, and noted that more modern tunes used for dancing featured pentatonic turns with frequent leaps in fourths.Elizabeth C.
