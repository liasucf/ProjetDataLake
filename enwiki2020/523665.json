    "text": "Llinos Golding, Baroness Golding (born 21 March 1933) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who currently sits in the House of Lords. She qualified as a radiographer and worked in the NHS and is currently the Patron of the Society of Radiographers. The daughter of Ness Edwards MP, she was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001, having replaced her husband John Golding. After stepping down at the 2001 general election she was created a Life peer as Baroness Golding, of Newcastle-under- Lyme in the County of Staffordshire in the same year. Baroness Golding was the peer who vouched for the two 'Fathers for Justice' protesters who threw a flour bomb at Prime Minister Tony Blair during Prime Minister's Questions on 19 May 2004. By vouching for them, Golding made it possible for the pair to access an area of the Commons viewing gallery not behind a glass security screen. There is no suggestion that she had any idea of their protest plans. Later the same afternoon, she apologised to the Houses of Lords and Commons for her part in the affair. She is a board member of the Countryside Alliance, a pro-hunting organisation. == References == ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Lady Golding's Statement on the 19 May incident * Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:Ceramic and Allied Trades Union- sponsored MPs Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Female life peers Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:UK MPs 1997\u20132001 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Newcastle-under-Lyme Category:20th-century British women politicians Category:21st-century British women politicians ",
