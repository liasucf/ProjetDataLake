    "text": "Herennia is a genus of spiders in the family Araneidae, found from India to northern Australia. It was formerly placed in a separate family, Nephilidae. While two species have been known since the 19th century, nine new species were described in 2005. Spiders in this genus are sometimes called coin spiders. While H. multipuncta is invasive and synanthropic, all other known species are endemic to islands. Like in the related genus Nephilengys, the much smaller males mutilate and sever their pedipalps, which are often found stuck in the epigynum or female genital openings. It is suggested that they act as mating plugs to prevent other males from mating with the female and thereby ensure the paternity of offspring. The males cannot mate subsequently and such \"eunuch\" individuals continue to stay near the female. ==Name== Herennia Etruscilla was the wife of Trajan Decius. There are coins bearing her image, which were probably the source for Thorell to name the genus. The non- scientific name coin spiders was proposed because of this fact. ==Species== H. multipuncta , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: * Herennia agnarssoni Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Solomon Islands * Herennia deelemanae Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Borneo * Herennia etruscilla Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Java * Herennia gagamba Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Philippines * Herennia jernej Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Sumatra * Herennia milleri Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 New Guinea, New Britain * Herennia multipuncta (Doleschall, 1859) \u2014 India to China, Borneo, Sulawesi * Herennia oz Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Northern Territory * Herennia papuana Thorell, 1881 \u2014 New Guinea * Herennia sonja Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Kalimantan, Sulawesi * Herennia tone Kuntner, 2005 \u2014 Philippines ==References== Category:Araneidae Category:Araneomorphae genera Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders of Oceania ",
