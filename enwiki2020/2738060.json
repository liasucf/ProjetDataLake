    "text": "strophoid: orange + pink curve In geometry, a strophoid is a curve generated from a given curve C and points A (the fixed point) and O (the pole) as follows: Let L be a variable line passing through O and intersecting C at K. Now let P1 and P2 be the two points on L whose distance from K is the same as the distance from A to K. The locus of such points P1 and P2 is then the strophoid of C with respect to the pole O and fixed point A. Note that AP1 and AP2 are at right angles in this construction. In the special case where C is a line, A lies on C, and O is not on C, then the curve is called an oblique strophoid. If, in addition, OA is perpendicular to C then the curve is called a right strophoid, or simply strophoid by some authors. The right strophoid is also called the logocyclic curve or foliate. ==Equations== ===Polar coordinates=== Let the curve C be given by r = f(\\theta), where the origin is taken to be O. Let A be the point (a, b). If K = (r \\cos\\theta,\\ r \\sin\\theta) is a point on the curve the distance from K to A is :d = \\sqrt{(r \\cos\\theta - a)^2 + (r \\sin\\theta - b)^2} = \\sqrt{(f(\\theta) \\cos\\theta - a)^2 + (f(\\theta) \\sin\\theta - b)^2}. The points on the line OK have polar angle \\theta, and the points at distance d from K on this line are distance f(\\theta) \\pm d from the origin. Therefore, the equation of the strophoid is given by :r = f(\\theta) \\pm \\sqrt{(f(\\theta) \\cos\\theta - a)^2 + (f(\\theta) \\sin\\theta - b)^2} ===Cartesian coordinates=== Let C be given parametrically by (x(t), y(t)). Let A be the point (a, b) and let O be the point (p, q). Then, by a straightforward application of the polar formula, the strophoid is given parametrically by: :u(t) = p + (x(t)-p)(1 \\pm n(t)),\\ v(t) = q + (y(t)-q)(1 \\pm n(t)), where :n(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x(t)-a)^2+(y(t)-b)^2}{(x(t)-p)^2+(y(t)-q)^2}}. ===An alternative polar formula=== The complex nature of the formulas given above limits their usefulness in specific cases. There is an alternative form which is sometimes simpler to apply. This is particularly useful when C is a sectrix of Maclaurin with poles O and A. Let O be the origin and A be the point (a, 0). Let K be a point on the curve, \\theta the angle between OK and the x-axis, and \\vartheta the angle between AK and the x-axis. Suppose \\vartheta can be given as a function \\theta, say \\vartheta = l(\\theta). Let \\psi be the angle at K so \\psi = \\vartheta - \\theta. We can determine r in terms of l using the law of sines. Since :{r \\over \\sin \\vartheta} = {a \\over \\sin \\psi},\\ r = a \\frac {\\sin \\vartheta}{\\sin \\psi} = a \\frac {\\sin l(\\theta)}{\\sin (l(\\theta) - \\theta)}. Let P1 and P2 be the points on OK that are distance AK from K, numbering so that \\psi = \\angle P_1KA and \\pi-\\psi = \\angle AKP_2. \\triangle P_1KA is isosceles with vertex angle \\psi, so the remaining angles, \\angle AP_1K and \\angle KAP_1, are (\\pi-\\psi)/2. The angle between AP1 and the x-axis is then :l_1(\\theta) = \\vartheta + \\angle KAP_1 = \\vartheta + (\\pi-\\psi)/2 = \\vartheta + (\\pi - \\vartheta + \\theta)/2 = (\\vartheta+\\theta+\\pi)/2. By a similar argument, or simply using the fact that AP1 and AP2 are at right angles, the angle between AP2 and the x-axis is then :l_2(\\theta) = (\\vartheta+\\theta)/2. The polar equation for the strophoid can now be derived from l1 and l2 from the formula above: :r_1=a \\frac {\\sin l_1(\\theta)}{\\sin (l_1(\\theta) - \\theta)} = a \\frac {\\sin ((l(\\theta)+\\theta+\\pi)/2)}{\\sin ((l(\\theta)+\\theta+\\pi)/2 - \\theta)} = a \\frac{\\cos ((l(\\theta)+\\theta)/2)}{\\cos ((l(\\theta)-\\theta)/2)} :r_2=a \\frac {\\sin l_2(\\theta)}{\\sin (l_2(\\theta) - \\theta)} = a \\frac {\\sin ((l(\\theta)+\\theta)/2)}{\\sin ((l(\\theta)+\\theta)/2 - \\theta)} = a \\frac{\\sin((l(\\theta)+\\theta)/2)}{\\sin((l(\\theta)-\\theta)/2)} C is a sectrix of Maclaurin with poles O and A when l is of the form q \\theta + \\theta_0, in that case l1 and l2 will have the same form so the strophoid is either another sectrix of Maclaurin or a pair of such curves. In this case there is also a simple polar equation for the polar equation if the origin is shifted to the right by a. ==Specific cases== ===Oblique strophoids=== Let C be a line through A. Then, in the notation used above, l(\\theta) = \\alpha where \\alpha is a constant. Then l_1(\\theta) = (\\theta + \\alpha + \\pi)/2 and l_2(\\theta) = (\\theta + \\alpha)/2. The polar equations of the resulting strophoid, called an oblique strphoid, with the origin at O are then :r = a \\frac{\\cos ((\\alpha+\\theta)/2)}{\\cos ((\\alpha-\\theta)/2)} and :r = a \\frac{\\sin ((\\alpha+\\theta)/2)}{\\sin ((\\alpha-\\theta)/2)}. It's easy to check that these equations describe the same curve. Moving the origin to A (again, see Sectrix of Maclaurin) and replacing \u2212a with a produces :r=a\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta-\\alpha)}{\\sin(\\theta-\\alpha)}, and rotating by \\alpha in turn produces :r=a\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta+\\alpha)}{\\sin(\\theta)}. In rectangular coordinates, with a change of constant parameters, this is :y(x^2+y^2)=b(x^2-y^2)+2cxy. This is a cubic curve and, by the expression in polar coordinates it is rational. It has a crunode at (0, 0) and the line y=b is an asymptote. ===The right strophoid=== A right strophoid Putting \\alpha = \\pi/2 in :r=a\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta-\\alpha)}{\\sin(\\theta-\\alpha)} gives :r=a\\frac{\\cos 2\\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = a(2\\cos\\theta-\\sec\\theta). This is called the right strophoid and corresponds to the case where C is the y-axis, A is the origin, and O is the point (a,0). The Cartesian equation is :y^2 = x^2(a-x)/(a+x). The curve resembles the Folium of Descartes and the line x = \u2212a is an asymptote to two branches. The curve has two more asymptotes, in the plane with complex coordinates, given by :x\\pm iy = -a. ===Circles=== Let C be a circle through O and A, where O is the origin and A is the point (a, 0). Then, in the notation used above, l(\\theta) = \\alpha+\\theta where \\alpha is a constant. Then l_1(\\theta) = \\theta + (\\alpha + \\pi)/2 and l_2(\\theta) = \\theta + \\alpha/2. The polar equations of the resulting strophoid, called an oblique strophoid, with the origin at O are then :r = a \\frac{\\cos (\\theta+\\alpha/2)}{\\cos (\\alpha/2)} and :r = a \\frac{\\sin (\\theta+\\alpha/2)}{\\sin (\\alpha/2)}. These are the equations of the two circles which also pass through O and A and form angles of \\pi/4 with C at these points. ==See also== *Conchoid *Cissoid ==References== * * * * * * * ==External links== Category:Curves ",
