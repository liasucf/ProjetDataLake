    "text": "High flyers, also known as long line high flyers, are vertical poles used by commercial fishermen that serve to locate the beginning and end of a long fishing line, commonly used in tuna, swordfish, as well as other fishing. Often constructed with a vertical marine grade aluminum pole which resists corrosion, they have a tapered fluted buoy to provide buoyancy, and the poles are about 6\u20139 feet (2\u20133 meters) high above the water. The counter-weight at the bottom is often a PVC pipe filled with concrete. The high flyer is tipped with an aluminum radar reflector that warns ships of a line between two high flyers. == References == Category:Fishing equipment ",
