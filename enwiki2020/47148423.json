    "text": "The 2015\u201316 daytime network television schedule for four of the five major English-language commercial broadcast networks in the United States covers the weekday daytime hours from September 2015 to August 2016. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, and any series canceled after the 2014\u201315 season. Affiliates fill time periods not occupied by network programs with local or syndicated programming. PBS \u2013 which offers daytime programming through a children's program block, PBS Kids \u2013 is not included, as its member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Also not included are stations affiliated with Fox (as the network does not air a daytime network schedule or network news), MyNetworkTV (as the programming service also does not offer daytime programs of any kind), and Ion Television (as its schedule is composed mainly of syndicated reruns). ==Legend== * New series are highlighted in bold. ==Schedule== * All times correspond to U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time scheduling (except for some live sports or events). Except where affiliates slot certain programs outside their network-dictated timeslots, subtract one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska, and Hawaii-Aleutian times. * Local schedules may differ, as affiliates have the option to pre-empt or delay network programs.\\- TV listings - Yahoo.com Such scheduling may be limited to preemptions caused by local or national breaking news or weather coverage (which may force stations to tape delay certain programs in overnight timeslots or defer them to a co-operated station or digital subchannel in their regular timeslot) and any major sports events scheduled to air in a weekday timeslot (mainly during major holidays). Stations may air shows at other times at their preference. ===Monday-Friday=== {| class=wikitable ! width=\"1.5%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" colspan=\"2\"|Network ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|7:00 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|7:30 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|8:00 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|8:30 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|9:00 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|9:30 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|10:00 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|10:30 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|11:00 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|11:30 am ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|noon ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|12:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|1:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|1:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|2:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|2:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|3:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|3:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|4:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|4:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|5:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|5:30 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|6:00 pm ! width=\"4%\" bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"|6:30 pm |- ! bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" colspan=\"2\"|ABC | bgcolor=\"gold\" colspan=\"4\"|Good Morning America | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"4\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"yellow\" colspan=\"2\"|The View | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"2\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"yellow\" colspan=\"2\"|The Chew | bgcolor=\"chartreuse\" colspan=\"2\"|General Hospital | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"7\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"gold\"|ABC World News Tonight with David Muir |- ! bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" colspan=\"2\"|CBS | bgcolor=\"gold\" colspan=\"4\"|CBS This Morning | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"2\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"pink\" colspan=\"2\"|Let's Make a Deal | bgcolor=\"pink\" colspan=\"2\"|The Price is Right | bgcolor=\"white\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"chartreuse\" colspan=\"2\"|The Young and the Restless | bgcolor=\"chartreuse\"|The Bold and the Beautiful | bgcolor=\"yellow\" colspan=\"2\"|The Talk | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"7\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"gold\"|CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley |- ! bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" colspan=\"2\"|NBC | bgcolor=\"gold\" colspan=\"8\"|Today | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"4\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"chartreuse\" colspan=\"2\"|Days of Our Lives | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"9\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"gold\"|NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt |- ! bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" colspan=\"2\"|CW | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"18\"|Local and/or syndicated programming | bgcolor=\"yellow\" colspan=\"2\"|The Bill Cunningham Show | bgcolor=\"white\" colspan=\"4\"|Local and/or syndicated programming |} * Note: CBS owned-and-operated and affiliate stations have the option of airing Let's Make a Deal at either 10:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m. Eastern, depending on the station's choice of feed. ===Saturday=== ===Sunday=== ==By network== ===ABC=== Returning series: * ABC World News Tonight * General Hospital * Good Morning America * The Chew * The View ===CBS=== Returning series: * CBS Evening News * CBS This Morning * Let's Make a Deal * The Bold and the Beautiful * The Price is Right * The Talk * The Young and the Restless ===The CW=== Returning series: * The Bill Cunningham Show * Racing Track * Brad & Shawn * 2 Fight Boys * Destination * Temple ===NBC=== Returning series: * Days of Our Lives * NBC Nightly News * Today ==See also== * 2015\u201316 United States network television schedule (prime-time) * 2015\u201316 United States network television schedule (late night) ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:United States weekday network television schedules Category:2015 in American television Category:2016 in American television ",
