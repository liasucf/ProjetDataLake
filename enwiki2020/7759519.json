Formed in 2004, the team was initially made up of players from the defunct Korean league who didn't immediately move to Anyang Halla from the Hyundai and Dongwon teams as well as other disbanded teams and players who had returned from military service. Prior to the 2007\u201308 season, the team was known as Kangwon Land (), named after their owner, Kangwon Land Corporation. Between 2005 and 2019, High1 competed in the Asia League Ice Hockey. ==History== 75pxThe team was formed as Kangwon Land in 2004, named after the owner. The team was formed with the intention of joining the Asia League and was expected to have an operating cost of 2 billion won. The owners also felt that the team's creation would aid in a bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics. The team's formation was first announced in January 2004. The team hired former Dong-won Dreams head coach, Kim Hee-woo. Their founding ceremony was on 15 September 2004 at COEX. Their first game was held at 1:00 pm on 5 October 2004 against Korea University as part of the 59th Korean Domestic Championship. They lost their first game by a score of 3-2. However, they finished as runner-up and took third place in the Kangwon Cup in December of the same year. In July 2005 it was announced that Kangwon Land would be admitted to the Asia League. At that time the team also announced that it would spend 46 days in Canada training, including playing 10 games, in preparation for the season. Alex Kim discusses strategy on-ice with Jeremy van Hoof. Kim won two points titles his first year in the league.Kangwon Land became the second Korean team to enter the Asia League during the 2005\u201306 season. They played 38 regular season games. All of their 19 home games were played in Chuncheon at the Eui Am ice rink. They were swept in their regular season series against Kokudo and the Nippon Paper Cranes while only managing to win one out of nine games against fellow South Korean team, Halla. They finished in seventh place with 28 points. The team also failed to break the top 10 in any of the point rankings. Joshua Liebenow led the team with 16 goals, Park Jin-hong led with 18 assists and Kim Kyu-hyun led the team with 26 points overall.

In the 2006\u201307 season the league reduced the number of games played to 34 with the departure of the Nordic Vikings.
