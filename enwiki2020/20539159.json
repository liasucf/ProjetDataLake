It is the only high school operated by Waltham Public Schools. ==History== The current Waltham High School was constructed in 1968 and expanded in 1998 and 2002. In 2018, Waltham Public Schools exercised eminent domain to buy land for a new Waltham High School. A $374 million loan for a new high school project was approved in 2019; it was the largest loan in Massachusetts history for a public high school. Construction started in September 2020, with the goal of having the new high school finished by the 2024-2025 school year. The school was originally slated to open for the 2020-201 school year before numerous issues in the site plan, acquisition, design and construction processes shifted the opening date back. ==Athletics== In 1906 and 1907, the Waltham football team was undefeated, although there was no organized playoff structure. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+State Championships !Sport !Year(s) |- |Baseball |1964 |- |Cheerleading |2016 |- |Ice hockey |2018 |} ==Performing arts== Waltham fields two competitive show choirs, the mixed- gender \"Music Unlimited\" and the all-female \"Music Express\".
