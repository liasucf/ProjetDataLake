    "text": "The 1990 Alabama Crimson Tide football team represented the University of Alabama for the 1990 College football season. The Crimson Tide was led by first-year head coach Gene Stallings, replacing Bill Curry who left for the University of Kentucky. ==Summary== The 1990 season got off to an excruciating start, as the Tide and new coach Gene Stallings lost three games by a combined total of eight points. In the opener against Southern Miss, star tailback Siran Stacy tore ligaments in his knee and missed the rest of the season. Against Florida, Alabama lost another star player for the year in wide receiver Craig Sanderson and quarterback Gary Hollingsworth threw three interceptions to Florida safety Will White, and the Gators scored the winning touchdown on a blocked punt.\"Loaded For Bear\", S. Looney, Douglas. Sports Illustrated, September 24, 1990 After wins over lightly regarded Vanderbilt and SW Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette), Bama traveled to Knoxville to face undefeated, third-ranked Tennessee. The result was a shocking 9\u20136 upset victory, Alabama's fifth in a row in the Third Saturday in October rivalry. The game was a defensive struggle and a field goal duel. UT's kicker Greg Harris, who hit a 51-yard field goal try to tie the game with ten minutes left, attempted a 50-yarder for the win with 1:35 to go, but Alabama's Stacy Harrison blocked the kick and the ball bounced to the Tennessee 37-yard line. The Crimson Tide advanced the ball seven yards on three running plays, setting up Philip Doyle's third field goal, a game-winning 48-yarder as time expired.\"COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Alabama Stuns Tennessee, 9\u20136\", New York Times, October 21, 1990 The next game was an ugly 9\u20130 loss to Penn State in which Hollingsworth threw five interceptions and Bama rushed for only six yards.\"Lions' defense smothers Tide in 9\u20130 win\" , The Daily Collegian (Penn State University), October 29, 1990 However, Alabama bounced back to win four in a row and salvage a winning season after the 0\u20133 start. Most importantly, Alabama won its first Iron Bowl in five years, dominating Auburn defensively and winning 16\u20137. It was the seventh game in a row in which the Alabama defense held the opposition to single digits. The season ended with a lopsided 34\u20137 bowl loss to Louisville, and Alabama finished 7\u20135. ==Schedule== ==Statistics== :Note: Does not include Fiesta Bowl. ===Overall=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
