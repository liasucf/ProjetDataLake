    "text": "Yreina Cervantez (born 1952) is an American artist and Chicana activist who is known for her multimedia painting, murals, and printmaking. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and her work is in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Mexican Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum, and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. == Biography == Cervantez was born in Garden City, Kansas and raised in Mount Palomar, California. Cervantez's mother was creative and served as an artistic inspiration to her daughter. Her childhood was spent in culturally segregated, rural areas and exposure to the conservative attitude of these neighborhoods inspired Cervantez to later join the Chicana/o movement. Later her family moved to Orange County. During high school, she focused on her watercolor skills. Cervantez received a BA from the University of California, Santa Cruz and in 1989 graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with an MFA. A founding member of the Los Angeles art collective Self Help Graphics, Cervantez spent six years working for this non-profit dedicated to supporting community artwork. In 1987, Cervantez's work was shown in Chicago at the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum. Her work was also part of the CARA project and traveling exhibition which opened in 1983 and had its final venue in 1994. Cervantez was a cast member of the feminist film, Define (1988), by O.Funmilayo Makarah. Between 1990 and 1993, she worked as a coordinator at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. Cervantez is currently a professor of Chicano Studies at California State University, Northridge. == Art == La Ofrenda (1989). Mural painted by Yreina Cerv\u00e1ntez. Located in Los Angeles, California at the First Avenue Bridge. The mural depicts the first female Mexican American union leader, alt=La Ofrenda: mural depicting Dolores Huerta by Yreina Cervantez Cervantez's work often includes a rich visual vocabulary that draws inspiration from pre-Columbian history, Central American politics, the urban landscape of Los Angeles and sometimes herself, as a viewer of what she is painting. She overlaps two different \"worlds,\" one of the present and another of the past, creating a visual space where ideologies are explored and examined. She uses the visual language of Aztlan to create a new artistic vocabulary. Growing up, Cervantez did not see many Latina images in popular culture and because of this, her portraits of Latina women and her self- portraits became an important part of her work. Cervantez's self-portraits show an artist that is at once whole and fragmented, experiencing nepantla. Cervantes often uses the self-portrait technique in order to explore cultural identity. In many of her self-portraits, she continues to blend contemporary culture with Aztec and mesoamerican imagery. Cervantez uses much of this type of iconography of the past in order to update the symbols and create a modern feminist perspective. Her female figures are often described as \"inspiring representations of female agency.\" Cervantez's art is also concerned with helping the viewer recognize that Chicanos are already in their own \"ancestral homelands\" and are actually not \"immigrants\" to the United States. Cervantez has also created many large-scale murals in Los Angeles and is considered a pioneer of the Chicana mural movement. She was involved with designing and painting part of The Great Wall of Los Angeles, which is thought to be the longest mural in the world. Cervantez has been a major influence on artist Favianna Rodriguez, who was so impressed with a printmaking class she took with Cervantez that she quit school to become a full-time artist. == References == == External links == * Faculty Profile Category:American artists of Mexican descent Category:Chicano Category:Mexican-American culture in Los Angeles Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:University of California, Santa Cruz alumni Category:UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture alumni Category:California State University, Northridge faculty Category:American muralists Category:American printmakers Category:Chicana feminists Category:Women muralists Category:American women printmakers Category:People from Garden City, New York Category:21st-century American women artists ",
