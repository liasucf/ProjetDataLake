He became a regular in Laois underage county sides. He won a Leinster Minor Football Championship with them in 2007. Tuohy represented Ireland in International rules football in both the 2011 and 2013 series. He scored a goal in the first Test in 2013 at Breffni Park. ==Australian football== ===Carlton=== Tuohy attracted the attention of Australian rules football recruiters from the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League, a club based in the inner city of Melbourne.
