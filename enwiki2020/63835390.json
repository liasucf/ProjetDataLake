    "text": "Kabardeeswarar temple (also called Swetha Vinayagar Temple, Vellai Vinayagar temple, Valanchuzinathar temple) is a Hindu temple situated in the village of Thiruvalanchuzhi (also spelt as Thiruvalanjuli) near Swamimalai in Kumbakonam taluk of Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India. Shiva is worshiped as Kabardeeswarar and is represented by the lingam and his consort Parvati is depicted as Brihannayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil poet saints known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. There are many inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the Chola dynasty, while later expansions, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century. The temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses a seven-tiered gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Kabardeeswarar and Swetha Vinayagar being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the shrine of Swetha Vinayagar that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. == Legend == thumb The temple is associated with a sage called Herandar, who, according to legend, is believed to have gone through an underground passage to the nether world and brought the Kaveri River to the earth to flow into the Bay of Bengal. Since the river took a convoluted direction in its flow, the place is called Tiruvalanjuzhi. There is an image of Herandar in the temple and the trunk of the elephant-headed god, Ganesha (Vinayagar) swirls towards the right.#A. 1987, p. 35 The presence of Buddhist images from the Chola period in the temple show influence of Buddhist tradition in the region. The temple is renowned for its shrine dedicated to Ganesha (Vinayagar, Vinayaka). The idol of Vinayaka is white in colour and is believed to have been created out of sea foam (kadal norai). Hence, the temple is also known as Swetha Vinayagar Temple in Sanskrit or Vellai Vinayakar Temple in Tamil, meaning \"the temple of the white Vinayaka\". According to popular legend, Indra, the king of the Devas created the idol of Ganesha out of sea foam during the churning of the ocean and left it in a niche in the temple hoping to get back the idol sometime later. But later, when he returned to remove the idol of Ganesha, it would not budge. So, the idol was allowed to remain where it was. A lattice-worked stone window pane called palahani is present in the temple. The temple is originally believed to have been built by Kanaka Chola in prehistoric times. As per another legend, when Devas (celestial deities) and Asuras (demons) were churning the Ocean of milk with Vasuki the serpent, they disregarded the advice of Vinayaka. It resulted in the spilling of poison in Amruta. To propitiate, the Devas created an image of Vinayaga with sea foam and worshipped him at the place. The image of the presiding deity is white in colour on account of the belief. The temple priests do not conduct abhishekham and pour any liquids over the deity for this reason. ==History== Intricate sculptures on the temple walls The central temple, according to historian Subramanyan, is an early Chola temple as seen from the inscription (ARE 620 of 1902) made during the reign of Rajaraja I (985\u20131014 CE) indicating grants made during the 38th regnal year of Madiraikonda Parakesarivarman. One another inscription on the south wall of the mandapa in front of the sanctum dated to Rajaraja indicates grant of land on the 21st year of the rule of Parakesarivarman. An inscription (ARE 633 of 1902) during the 25th regnal year of Rajaraja indicates gift of gold to the deity by Kundavai, the daughter of the king. Another inscription dated to the 258th day during the 24th regnal year of Rajaraja on the south wall of the hall indicates tax free land to the service of two deities, namely, Kshetrapalar and Ganapatiyar. The inscription on the north wall of the hall (ARE 633-B of 1902) dated to the third regnal year of Rajendra I (1012\u20131044 CE) indicates that he ceremonially passed through a hill of gingely seeds and gifted twelve gold flowers to the feet of Lord.
