WVOG's studios are located on Loumor Avenue in Metairie, Louisiana. The transmitter is off River Road, also in Metairie.Radio-Locator.com/WVOG-AM ==History== The first New Orleans station at AM 600 signed on in 1950 as WMRY.Broadcasting Yearbook 1951 page 159 It was originally a daytimer, broadcasting at 500 watts during the day and required to sign-off at night to avoid interfering with other stations on the same frequency. WMRY was programmed to the African American community. An advertisement in the 1951 Broadcasting Yearbook, using the vocabulary of that era, said that a half million \"colored people\" lived in the WMRY coverage area and that WMRY was \"programmed for Negroes by Negroes.\" In the 1958, the WMRY call sign and programming moved over to AM 940 and became the current WYLD. After the move, a new station was launched on the AM 600 frequency by Dave Waagenvord as WWOM (Wonderful World Of Music).Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-161 It carried a beautiful music format of mostly instrumental versions of pop songs and music from Broadway and Hollywood. In 1965, Waagenvord launched 98.5 WWOM-FM (now WYLD-FM), and in 1967, he added a TV station, channel 26 WWOM-TV (now WGNO). In the 1970s, the station's power increased to 1,000 watts, but it still was not authorized to broadcast at night. In 1974, the station was bought by F. W. Robbert, the current owner. He switched to a Christian radio format as WVOG.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-95 In the early 2010s, the station received authorization to broadcast at night, although with the low power of 31 watts. ==References== ==External links== *WVOG official website *FCC History Cards for WVOG WVOG Category:Gospel radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1953 Category:Christian radio stations in Louisiana ",
