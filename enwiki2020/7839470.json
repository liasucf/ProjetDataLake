    "text": "The New Englander is a cocktail made from two to three parts Moxie to one part gin. The name derives from Moxie's regional popularity in parts of New England. Some people also detect a slight resemblance in taste to Necco wafers, another regional product. ==Recipe== 1 part Gordon's Gin 2-3 parts Moxie a large slice of lime a dash of Worcestershire sauce The Worcestershire sauce cuts the drink's sweetness. While some prefer to leave it out, purists argue that a New Englander is incomplete without it. However, in Western Massachusetts, it is frequently left out - this version is called a \"Felix\". ==References== Category:Cocktails with gin Category:New England cuisine ",
