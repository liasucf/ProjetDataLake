According to their website the aim of the project is to develop a rich wiki-based web resource for people interested in or developing projects that involve bioart, open source software/open source hardware, DIY biology, art/science collaborations and electronic experimentation. Hackteria designs were featured in the book Open-Source Lab by Joshua M. Pearce. SciDev reports that Hackteria is trying to change the way development is done with DIY. Wired highlighted a project inspired by Hackteria's earlier prototypes on mobile labs to create the Darwin Toolbox: the portable DIY biotechnology lab-in-a-box, now developed further as the Bento Lab. In India, Hackteria is known for the science of art making. ==See also== * Do-it-yourself biology ==References== ==External links== * Category:Internet properties established in 2009 Category:BioArt Category:Wikis Category:Free software Category:Hacker culture ",
