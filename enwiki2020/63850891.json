    "text": "The Stalking Protection Act 2019 (c. 9) is an Act of Parliament put forward as a private member's bill by then Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston which creates a civil protection order to prevent stalking. == Background == In 2012, the Government amended the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 to introduce two new stalking offences, however, there were little protections where the perpetrator is not a partner or ex-partner, with this act aiming to address these concerns. The Crime Survey for England and Wales reports that more than 1 in 5 women and nearly 1 in 10 men aged 16 to 59 have been victims of stalking since the age of 16. In 2017 to 2018 there were 1,616 prosecutions commenced under stalking offences, with 73% related to domestic abuse. == References == Category:Law enforcement in the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2019 Category:2019 in British law ",
