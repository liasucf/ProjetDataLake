Located at the intersection of Wyckoff and DeKalb Avenues in Bushwick, Brooklyn, it is served by the L train at all times. ==History== DeKalb Avenue opened on July 14, 1928, as part of an extension of the Canarsie Line. This extension connected Montrose Avenue, which had opened four years earlier, to Broadway Junction, which was the western end of the already-operating elevated line to Canarsie. ==Station layout== Platform level This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. Each platform has blue columns are regular intervals with every other column having a standard black and white station name plate. The mosaic tile bands are predominantly green and blue, with yellow and tan accents. Those installed on the stairway from the mezzanine to the Manhattan-bound platform in Summer 2000 feature a seven-inch entrance motif design with a dull green and blue background.http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/BMT_Canarsie_Line#DeKalb_Avenue The trim line has \"D\" tablets on it at regular intervals to represent \"DeKalb.\" ===Exits=== This station has three entrances/exits.
