It slows down the plot, and to me, this episode didn't move to the pace I wanted it too. At least give us something more.\" In contrast, Jessica Goldstein of Vulture wrote a mixed review for the episode, saying: \"It's possible that I've said this before, but I think we have really, truly crossed over to a realm where Pretty Little Liars has no plot at all. Not like 'the plot doesn't make any sense,' a conundrum faced many a time in Rosewood. We are operating in a universe with a total absence of plot.\" \"Exes and OMGs\" currently holds an 8.1/10 rating on IMDb and an 8.5/10 on TV.com. == References == == External links == * * Category:Pretty Little Liars episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ",
