    "text": "Borja Ekiza Imaz (born 6 March 1988) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a central defender. ==Club career== ===Athletic Bilbao=== Born in Pamplona, Ekiza arrived at Athletic Bilbao's youth system at the age of 14, being eligible to represent the Basque through his Navarrese roots. He spent his first two senior seasons with CD Basconia, the club's third team. Subsequently, Ekiza played with the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, being sparingly used over two years. On 8 January 2011, after a string of injuries to the defensive sector in the first team awarded him with promotion to the main squad, he made his La Liga debut in a 1\u20131 away draw against M\u00e1laga CF, playing the full 90 minutes; he finished his first top-flight campaign established in the starting XI, beating competition from seasoned veterans Fernando Amorebieta, Aitor Ocio and Ustaritz and being booked only once. In 2013\u201314, Ekiza lost his starting spot to Aymeric Laporte and Carlos Gurpegui due to repeated injuries, and only appeared once in the league during the season, 37 minutes in a 2\u20131 win at Real Valladolid. On 31 July 2014, he terminated his contract with the Lions and signed a two-year deal with fellow league side SD Eibar hours later. ===Later years=== On 21 July 2017, Cypriot First Division club AC Omonia announced the signing of Ekiza from Ukraine's FC Zirka Kropyvnytskyi. Two years later, following a spell in the same country and league with Enosis Neon Paralimni FC, the 31-year-old announced his retirement from football. ==Club statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Basconia |- |2006\u201307 |18||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||18||0 |- |2007\u201308 |23||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||23||0 |- !Total!!41!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!41!!0 |- |rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\"|Bilbao Athletic |- |2008\u201309 |14||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||14||1 |- |2009\u201310 |8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||8||0 |- |2010\u201311 |14||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||14||0 |- !Total!!36!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!36!!1 |- |rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"center\"|Athletic Bilbao |- |2010\u201311 |21||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||21||0 |- |2011\u201312 |21||0||2||0||8||0||31||0 |- |2012\u201313 |24||0||1||0||3||0||28||0 |- |2013\u201314 |1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||0 |- !Total!!67!!0!!4!!0!!11!!0!!82!!0 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Eibar |- |2014\u201315 |11||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||13||0 |- |2015\u201316 |4||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||7||1 |- !Total!!15!!0!!5!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!20!!1 |- |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Zirka |- |2016\u201317 |10||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||11||1 |- |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Omonia |- |2017\u201318 |6||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||6||1 |- |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Enosis Neon |- |2018\u201319 |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Career total !175!!3!!10!!1!!11!!0!!197!!4 |} ==Honours== Athletic Bilbao *Copa del Rey runner-up: 2011\u201312 *UEFA Europa League runner-up: 2011\u201312 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Pamplona Category:Spanish footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:CD Basconia footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:SD Eibar footballers Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:FC Zirka Kropyvnytskyi players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:AC Omonia players Category:Enosis Neon Paralimni FC players Category:Basque Country international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus ",
