    "text": "The Unbearable Lightness of Being Original Soundtrack Recording is the official soundtrack album for the 1988 film of the same name, an adaptation of the Milan Kundera novel. The soundtrack is composed of various classical pieces by Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek as well as a Czech language translation of the Beatles' song \"Hey Jude\", performed by Marta Kubi\u0161ov\u00e1, and the traditional Czechoslovakian folk song \"Joj, Joj, Joj\", performed by Jarmila \u0160ul\u00e1kov\u00e1 and Vojt\u011bch Jochec. ==Background== According to a liner essay by Grover Sales, the idea of utilising the music of Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek was first suggested by Milan Kundera towards the beginning of the film's production. Kundera's father was a concert musician and a proponent of Jan\u00e1\u010dek's music. The two non-classical pieces in the film, a Czech version of \"Hey Jude\" and the traditional Czechoslovakian song \"Joj, Joj, Joj\", were chosen to reflect the utilisation of rock and jazz music as tools of protest against the Soviet government during the period surrounding the Prague Spring. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Discogs Category:1988 soundtrack albums ",
