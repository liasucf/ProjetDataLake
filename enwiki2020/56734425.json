The peasants, including those in Krankka\u2019s home region of northern Ostrobothnia, rebelled against oppression, including often unbearable borgl\u00e4ger-type taxation. In early 1597, midway into the war after the uprising\u2019s first leader Jaakko Ilkka had been executed, the bailiff Israel Laurinpoika with the help of Perttu Palo and Krankka recruited more than 3,000 men. Krankka, a veteran leader during war with Russia, was chosen to serve as commander over companies from Liminka, Kemi and Ii.

While preparing for a major battle here, Laurinpoika said he was going to leave to gather more men to fight but fled instead, causing disorganization. Additionally, the peasants had relatively primitive weapons, such as clubs and spears, to use against the well-equipped troops of Clas Fleming serving under Sweden\u2019s King Sigismund. The peasants were defeated at this, the final battle, with many casualties. Krankka was captured and imprisoned at Turku Castle. Later that year when Duke Charles (the future King Charles IX of Sweden), an enemy of Sigismund, took control of the castle, he was freed.Katajala, K. \u201cDid the Rich Lead the Poor to Rebel in the Finnish Peasant Revolts of the 15th\u201317th Centuries?\u201d In: Koskinen, U. (eds) Aggressive and Violent Peasant Elites in the Nordic Countries, C. 1500-1700. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016. In more recent times Krankka and the other peasant leaders are remembered as being part of what some historians consider being the first movements toward Finland\u2019s independence. Krankka's uprising days are the subject of Kaarlo Kramsu\u2019s 1887 poem, \"Hannu Krankka.\"Kramsu, Kaarlo. \u201cHannu Krankka.\u201d Runoelmia.

In 2005, a bronze statue of Krankka by sculptor Niilo Rikula was erected near Liminka, Finland. == References == Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1630s deaths Category:Finnish revolutionaries ",
