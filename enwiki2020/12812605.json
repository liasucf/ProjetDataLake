    "text": "Tea Break Over\u2013Back on Your 'Eads!, released in 1975, was the eighth and final studio album by British jazz-rock band If. It was followed in 1995 by a compilation CD covering tracks from the first three LPs featuring the band's previous line-up. The album reflects the band's more rock-influenced style, perfectly balanced with Dick Morrissey's harsher hard bop/bebop sax playing. The title track \"Tea Break\", referring to the hardships of being \"on the road\", is the punch line to an old musicians' joke and contains a tribute to Charlie Parker in the lyrics (\"The Bird was the man to be heard\" and \"The music was the word\") as well as in a swirling bebop tenor solo. The \"Ballad of the Yessirom Kid\", a tribute by the band to Dick Morrissey, finishes with a roaring bebop tenor solo. \"Song for Alison\" features the flute more than holding its own with a rock accompaniment. The song \"Don Quixote\" opens with an extensive acoustic Spanish guitar solo by Whitehorn. == Track listing == (LP version \\- the CD re-release varies the order slightly) ===Side one=== #\"Merlin the Magic Man\" (Davies) \u2013 5:05 #\"I Had a Friend\" (Davies) \u2013 4:30 #\"Tea Break Over, Back on Your 'Eads\" (Whitehorn, Davies, Monaghan) \u2013 6:05 ===Side two=== #\"Ballad of the Yessirrom Kid\" (Davies) \u2013 5:20 #\"Raw Sewage\" (Davies) \u2013 6:13 #\"Song for Alison\" (Morrissey) \u2013 3:55 #\"Don Quixote's Masquerade\" (Davies) \u2013 7:50 ==Personnel== * Dick Morrissey - saxophones, flute * Geoff Whitehorn - electrics and acoustic guitars, vocals * Gabriel Magno \u2013 organ, piano * Walt Monaghan \u2013 bass, vocals * Cliff Davies \u2013 drums, vocals, synthesiser * Carlos Martinez \u2013 percussion ==References== Category:1975 albums Category:If (band) albums ",
