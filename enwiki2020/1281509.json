    "text": "The Ourthe (Walloon: Aiwe d' O\u00fbte) is a long river in the Ardennes in Wallonia (Belgium). It is a right tributary to the river Meuse. The Ourthe is formed at the confluence of the Ourthe Occidentale (Western Ourthe) and the Ourthe Orientale (Eastern Ourthe), west of Houffalize. The source of the Ourthe Occidentale is near Libramont-Chevigny, in the Belgian province Luxembourg. The source of the Ourthe Orientale is near Gouvy, also in the Belgian province Luxembourg, close to the border with Luxembourg. After the confluence of the two Ourthes near Nisramont, the Ourthe flows roughly in north-west and later in northern direction. Near Noiseux it flows for a short distance through the province of Namur. After the municipality of Durbuy it flows in the province of Li\u00e8ge. Eventually it flows into the river Meuse in the city of Li\u00e8ge. The most important tributaries of the river Ourthe are the Ambl\u00e8ve and the Vesdre. Towns along the Ourthe are Houffalize (Ourthe Orientale), La Roche-en-Ardenne, Hotton, Durbuy, Hamoir and Esneux. ==See also== * D\u00e9partement de l'Ourthe == Gallery == Confluence of the two ourthes.JPG|Confluence of the Ourthe Occidentale (Western Ourthe) and the Ourthe Orientale (Eastern Ourthe) La_Roche.jpg|The river in La Roche-en-Ardenne Ourthe333.JPG|The Ourthe near Beffe in autumn Ourthe beffe.JPG|Again the Ourthe near Beffe in autumn Taxodium distichum (Rendeux) JPG1.jpg|The Robert Lenoir Arboretum near Rendeux alongside the Ourthe Hotton JPG01.jpg|The river at Hotton, and a view of the city church Sy2.jpg|Rocks at the Ourthe near Sy 0 Hamoir - L'Ourthe (2).jpg|Bridge across the river at Hamoir 20100705 combain pont02.JPG|The Ourthe flowing through Comblain-au-Pont Esneux JPG01.jpg|View at Esneux and its bridge across the river Lock on Ourthe canal, Li\u00e8ge.jpg|Lock on the Ourthe canal that runs parallel to the lower part of the river, Li\u00e8ge Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of Wallonia Category:Rivers of Li\u00e8ge (province) Category:Rivers of Luxembourg (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Namur (province) Category:Geography of Li\u00e8ge ",
