Twenty All-Star Games have been held since the Panthers entered the league in 1993, with at least one player chosen to represent the Panthers in each year except 1998 and 2011. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. Florida has hosted one of the games. The 53rd took place at the BB&T; Center, then known as the Office Depot Center. * Selected by fan vote * All-Star Game Most Valuable Player2014\u201315 NHL Official Guide & Record Book, p. 234 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Florida Panthers players and coaches selected to the All-Star GameFlorida Panthers 14\u201315 Media Guide. p.178 |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 45th |rowspan=\"2\" |1994 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 46th |rowspan=\"3\" |1996 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 47th |rowspan=\"3\" |1997 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 48th |1998 |No Panthers selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 49th | 1999 | (Did not play) | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 50th |rowspan=\"3\" |2000 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 51st |2001 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 52nd |2002 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 53rd |rowspan=\"2\"|2003 | | |rowspan=\"2\"| |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 54th |2004 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 55th |2007 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 56th |2008 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 57th |2009 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 58th |2011 |No Panthers selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 59th |2012 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 60th |rowspan=\"2\" |2015 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 61st |rowspan=\"4\" |2016 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 62nd |2017 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 63rd |2018 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 64th |2019 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 65th |2020 | | | |} ==Career achievements== ===Hockey Hall of Fame=== The following is a list of Florida Panthers who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Florida Panthers inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Category ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Panthers in category ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2011 |2006\u20132007 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2012 |1999\u20132002 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2010 |1998\u20131999 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2008 |1998\u20131999 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |2002 |1993\u20131995 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2011 |2005\u20132006 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |1995 |1993\u20132001 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |} ===United States Hockey Hall of Fame=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Members of the Florida Panthers inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Panthers ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |2019 |2013\u20132014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | |2007 |1993\u20131998 | |} ===Retired numbers=== The Florida Panthers have retired three of their jersey numbers.
