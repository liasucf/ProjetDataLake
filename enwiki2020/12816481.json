Provocation.\" Mary Bauermeister and her son Simon Stockhausen performed together on the stage. The artist Gregor Zootzky and his animated short film \"Psst pp Piano - Hommage \u00e0 Mary Bauermeister\". Mary Hilde Ruth Bauermeister (born 7 September 1934) is a German artist who works in sculpture, drawing, installation, performance, and music. Influenced by Fluxus artists and Nouveau R\u00e9alisme, her work addresses esoteric issues of how information is transferable through society. \"I only followed an inner drive to express what was not yet there, in reality or thought,\" she said of her practice. \"To make art was more a finding, searching process than a knowing.\" Since the 1970s, the artist's work has concentrated on the themes surrounding New Age spirituality, specifically geomancy, the divine interpretation of lines on the ground. ==Biography== ===Early life and artistic beginnings=== Mary Bauermeister was born in Frankfurt am Main to Wolf Bauermeister, a professor of genetics and anthropology, and Laura Bauermeister, a singer. Mary Bauermeister was artistically influenced in secondary school (1946\u201354) by her drawing teacher, G\u00fcnter Ott. She studied in 1954\u201355 at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Ulm and in 1955\u201356 at the Staatlichen Schule f\u00fcr Kunst und Handwerk in Saarbr\u00fccken. She has been active since 1957 as a freelance artist in Cologne. In 1960, in her studio at Lintgasse 28 in Cologne, she launched a series of gatherings of members of the evolving global artistic movement Fluxus.[...]\"Mary Bauermeister (artist renowned for hosting avant-garde gatherings in 1960s Cologne)\" (seminar speaker on 5 February 2009, in Korea) Fluxus Heidelberg Center Blog At her invitation, avant-garde poets, composers and visual artists such as Hans G Helms, David Tudor, John Cage, Christo, Wolf Vostell, George Brecht, and Nam June Paik organised unconventional concerts of the \"newest music\", readings, exhibits, and actions. These activities have been described as \"comparatively non-hierarchical exchanges of information across national, disciplinary and age boundaries\", contributing in that way to the character of the Fluxus movement which had been developing during the 1950s.Higgins 2002, 11. In 1961, she took part in Karlheinz Stockhausen's composition course at the Internationalen Ferienkursen f\u00fcr Neue Musik in Darmstadt.Stockhausen 1963, 167. Later that same year she collaborated with Stockhausen in a theatre piece titled Originale (Originals), which was given twelve performances at the Theater am Dom, Cologne, from 26 October to 6 November 1961. Amongst the performers were Bauermeister herself (as The Painter), Nam June Paik (Actions), David Tudor (Piano and Percussion), and Hans G. Helms (The Poet).Stockhausen 1963, 107\u201329. In 1962 she had her first solo exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam with a simultaneous day-long performance of electronic music under Stockhausen's direction. On 3 April 1967, in San Francisco, she married Stockhausen, with whom she had two children: Julika (born 22 January 1966) and Simon (born 5 June 1967).Bauermeister 2011, 174, 207, 212. They were divorced in 1972.Stockhausen-Stiftung [2013]. She has two younger daughters, Sophie (born July 1972, father David Johnson) and Esther (born 1974, father Josef Halevi).Bauermeister 2011, 284, 295. ===Residence in New York=== Bauermeister, Perhaps (1965) Drawn by the vitality of the Pop Art movement, in October 1962 Bauermeister relocated to New York City. In the artistic circles of Pop Art, Nouveau R\u00e9alisme and Fluxus, she maintained friendships with Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely. In New York Bauermeister enjoyed considerable artistic success. Since 1964 she has exhibited regularly at the Galeria Bonino on 57th Street. ===Later life=== In the 1970s, Mary Bauermeister returned to Germany and began to occupy herself with marginal sciences, for example Geomancy, the science of energy structures in the earth. She used the knowledge she garnered from these studies for the planning of gardens, which she implemented for public and private clients throughout the world. The artist now lives in R\u00f6srath near Cologne. On the occasion of her 70th birthday in September 2004, the Cologne Museum Ludwig acquired her 1963 wall installation Needless Needles and arranged a display of the work for several months. In 2019, Museum Ludwig acquired three more works by Mary Bauermeister, Rundes Wabenbild, Magnetbild Schwarz-Weiss and the relating 34 sketches M\u00f6glichkeiten Serieller Malerei. 2018 Mary Bauermeister signed an exclusive contract with the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery in New York. == Honours == On 15 June 2020, Bauermeister was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit for her contributions to Germany's post-war art scene. She received the award from the German State Minister of Culture and Science, Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen.
