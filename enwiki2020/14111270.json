    "text": "The Marchington River is a river in the Hudson Bay drainage basin located in Kenora and Thunder Bay Districts in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It travels from its head at Kashaweogama Lake in Thunder Bay District through a series of lakes to Marchington Lake, where it meets the Sturgeon River and North River. It then continues over the small McDougall Falls and through Botsford Lake before emptying into the English River at Abram Lake near Sioux Lookout. Highway 516 crosses the river approximately north of its confluence with Marchington Lake. Highway 642 and the CN transcontinental rail line cross the river about and respectively upstream of the mouth, near Superior Junction. ==Tributaries== *Houghton Creek *Drive Creek *Runway Creek *Marchington Lake **Sturgeon River **North River *Martin Creek ==See also== *List of rivers of Ontario ==References== * * Category:Rivers of Kenora District Category:Rivers of Thunder Bay District Category:Tributaries of Hudson Bay ",
