    "text": "The inauguration of Muhammadu Buhari as the 15th President of Nigeria, and 4th President in the fourth Nigerian Republic took place on Friday, 29 May 2015. It marked the beginning of the first term of Muhammadu Buhari as President following the 2015 general election. The Federal Government declared 29 May a public holiday. More than fifty representatives from foreign governments were expected to attend the inauguration. The government intended to spend less than \u20a62 billion (US$10 million) for the ceremony. The Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal has dismissed a petition filed by the Hope Democratic Party (HDP) seeking to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari from being sworn in for a second term on May 29, 2019. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Buhari winner of the February 23 presidential election with a total of 15,191,847 votes. However, the HDP and its presidential candidate, Ambrose Oworu, filed a petition before the tribunal to nullify the election on the grounds of INEC's non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act. While delivering judgement on Wednesday, May 22, 2019, the three-member panel of the tribunal ruled that the petitioners' application lacked merit and dismissed it. Pulse.ng ==Background== Buhari won the presidential election by more than 2.5 million votes. On 17 May 2015, Buhari's campaign spokesperson said that following the inauguration, the President \"would simply be addressed as Muhammadu Buhari, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\" He would also not prefer to be addressed as \"Mr., Alhaji or Mallam\". Buhari's official portrait was also unveiled on the same day. On 24 May 2015, the All Progressives Congress issued a statement saying that outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan was \"handing over a nation in deep crisis\" and that there was \"no electricity, no fuel, workers are on strike, billions are owed to state and federal workers, $60 billion are owed in national debt and the economy is virtually grounded\". On 26 May 2015, the National Union of Nigerian Students issued a statement saying that South African President Jacob Zuma was not welcome due to his \"poor handling\" of the recent xenophobic attacks against foreign nationals in his country. It also stated that there is \"no point felicitating with a people who clearly do not matter much to you\" and his visit will only amount to pretence. On 27 May 2015, Premium Times reported that the ruling People's Democratic Party had deliberately received the bulk of the 5,000 invitation cards as there were plans to allegedly boo the outgoing president. They also didn't want him to be embarrassed and instead give him a \"cheerful exit\". Following appeal made by many to probe the outgoing administration, President Jonathan during a valedictory session of the Federal Executive Council, said that any future probe should be \"extended beyond [his] administration. Otherwise.. it [would] be witch-hunt\". Suleiman Hashimu walked 750 km from Lagos to Abuja, fulfilling his vow that he had made if General Buhari won the presidency. It took him 18 days to trek the route. He had taken with him \u20a6100,000 ($500) but only spent \u20a63,500 as he was catered for by the people along the way. ==Pre-inaugural events== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Date !! Activity !!

The Kenyan Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary denied these reports and described the list as fake. Citizen News reported that the two-day trip would have cost at least KSh 20 million (about $200,000) in allowances and airfare. Instead, Deputy President William Ruto accompanied by ten officials, represented the president. At the inauguration ceremony, Sahara Reporters' Adeola Fayehun asked Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe when he would be stepping down. Fayehun asked him if there was democracy in Zimbabwe and that it was time for him to step down. Mugabe's spokesperson George Charamba described the reporters as \"activists with cameras\" and that they \"took advantage of protocol restrictions that were imposed on delegations.\" Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo tweeted that the reporters were \"political activists masquerading as journalists who imagine their country as a model of democracy.\" Moyo also stated that \"free countries have rules including diplomatic courtesy not the display of Boko Haram journalism.\" ==References== ==External links== * www.thisisbuhari.com * Programme of Activities, State House Nigeria. * Category:Presidential inaugurations Category:2015 in Nigeria Category:Politics of Nigeria Category:2015 in politics Category:Muhammadu Buhari Category:May 2015 events in Africa ",
