On July 2, 2015, Kraft completed its merger with Heinz, arranged by Heinz owners Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, creating the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, Kraft Heinz Company. ==History== ===Spinoff of Kraft Foods Group from Mondel\u0113z International, Inc=== In August 2011, Kraft Foods Inc. announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies\u2014a snack food company and a grocery company. On April 2, 2012, Kraft Foods Inc. announced that it had filed a Form 10 Registration Statement to the SEC to split the company into two companies to serve the \"North American grocery business\". On October 1, 2012, Kraft Foods Inc. spun off its North American grocery business to a new company called Kraft Foods Group, Inc. The remainder of Kraft Foods Inc. was renamed Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. and was refocused as an international snack and confection company. On November 19, 2013, an arbitration ruling ordered Starbucks to pay Kraft Foods Inc. $2.7 billion because of an early contract termination. The money will go to Mondel\u0113z International, Inc. ===Kraft and Heinz merger=== On March 25, 2015, Kraft Foods Group Inc. announced that it would merge with the H.J. Heinz Company, owned by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to form the world's fifth-largest food and beverage company. Kraft's shares rose about 17 percent in premarket trading after the announcement of the deal, which will bring Heinz back to the public market following its takeover over two years prior. The companies completed the merger on July 2, 2015. ==Sponsorships and promotions== Kraft is an official partner and sponsor of both Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League. Kraft Hockeyville began in 2006 as a Canadian reality television series developed by CBC/SRC Sports and sponsored by Kraft Foods in which communities across Canada compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey. The contest revolves around a central theme of community spirit. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL preseason game. In 2007, it was then relegated to segments aired during Hockey Night in Canada. In 2015, Kraft Hockeyville was expanded into the United States, with a separate competition for communities there. From 2002 to 2014, Kraft sponsored the Kraft Nabisco Championship, one of the four \"majors\" on the LPGA tour. The company also sponsored the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, a post-season college football bowl game, from 2010 to 2012. In 2011, Kraft has released an iPad app called \"Big Fork Little Fork\" which, in addition to games and other distractions, has information regarding how to use Kraft Foods in nutritious ways. ==Brands== The old Kraft logo still seen on some Kraft-branded products The company's core businesses are in beverage, cheese, dairy foods, snack foods, and convenience foods. Kraft's major brands include: * A.1. * Boca Burger * Capri Sun U.S. Licensee * Claussen pickles * Field * Gevalia * Grey Poupon * Horsemen * Jell-O * Kool-Aid * Kraft, including Kraft Dinner, Kraft Singles, Kraft Mayo * Maxwell House * Oscar Mayer * Philadelphia Cream Cheese * Planters * Polly-O * RIDG's Finer Foods, licensing name used by Kraft addressing Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce * Seven Seas \u2013 salad dressings * Velveeta ==Corporate social responsibility== For years, Kraft purchased paper for its packaging from Asia Pulp & Paper, the third-largest paper producer in the world, which was labeled as a \"forest criminal\" for destroying \"precious habitat\" in Indonesia's rainforest. In 2011, when Kraft canceled its contract with Asia Pulp & Paper, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford commended Kraft for efforts made towards forest protection, for \"taking rainforest conservation seriously\". ==Controversy== === Food quality === In 2013, food blogger and activist Vani Hari and blogger Lisa Leake launched an online petition drive to compel Kraft Foods Group, Inc. to remove controversial synthetic dyes Yellow 5 (labeled as Tartrazine) and Yellow 6 from its signature macaroni and cheese products. In April 2013, Hari and Leake delivered a petition with some 270,000 signatures to Kraft headquarters in Chicago, Ill., and asked the company to change its macaroni and cheese recipes. In October 2013, Kraft announced that it would remove artificial dyes from three macaroni and cheese varieties made in kid-friendly shapes, but not its plain elbow-shaped Kraft Macaroni and Cheese product with \"original flavor\". However, in 2017 the New York Times highlighted the continued prevalence of harmful chemicals of phthalates, which can cause male hormone disruption, that were found in high concentrations in Kraft boxed macaroni and cheese powder. === Factory pollution === In 1989, Kraft Foods was listed as one of the top polluters in Ontario, for pumping into Hoople Creek (Ingleside, Ontario) pollutants including phosphorus, suspended solids, and oxygen- destroying material. ==See also== * List of Kraft brands * List of dairy product companies in the United States * General Foods * Ovson Egg ==References== ==External links== * Category:Kraft Heinz Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Condiment companies of the United States Category:Dairy products companies of the United States Category:Food manufacturers of the United States Category:Multinational dairy companies Category:Multinational food companies Category:Multinational companies headquartered in the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Chicago Category:Manufacturing companies based in Chicago Category:American companies established in 2012 Category:Food and drink companies established in 2012 Category:American companies disestablished in 2015 Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 2015 Category:2012 establishments in Illinois Category:2015 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:American brands Category:Corporate spin- offs Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions ",
