    "text": "Sud Radio Transmitter Pic Blanc is a facility for high power medium wave broadcasting located on Pic Blanc, a mountain at 1\u00b043'1\"E and 42\u00b032'5\"N in Andorra. Whilst in operation, it was the highest medium wave transmitting station in Europe. It was built in 1972 by Sud Radio and uses a directional antenna consisting of two free-standing 86 metre tall lattice towers. One of these towers is insulated against ground, while the other one is grounded and carries a cage aerial. The transmitter worked on 819 kHz with a power of 900 kilowatts. It was shut down in November 1981. As replacement, a small transmitter at Gaur\u00e9 near Toulouse was built. Now the facility is abandoned and one of the two towers has been partly dismantled. ==See also== * List of towers ==References== ==External links== * http://perso.wanadoo.fr/tvignaud/galerie/etranger/and-sudradio.htm * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b58031 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b58032 Category:Radio masts and towers in Europe Category:Buildings and structures in Andorra Category:Towers in France Category:Transmitter sites in France Category:Towers completed in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Andorra ",
