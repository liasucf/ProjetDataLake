According to an American obituary bridge column, he was known in Hungary as \"the ultimate authority on Hungarian prose\". == Biography == Ottlik was born and died in Budapest. He attended the military school at K\u0151szeg and Budapest, and studied mathematics and physics at Budapest University 1931\u20131935. After a brief career on Hungarian radio, he was a secretary of Hungarian PEN Club from 1945 to 1957. As he was unable to publish his works for political reasons, he earned his living translating. He translated mainly from English (Charles Dickens, George Bernard Shaw, John Osborne, Evelyn Waugh); and German (Thomas Mann, G. Keller, Stefan Zweig). He was a passionate bridge player and advanced theoretician. In a bridge column three months after Ottlik's death, Alan Truscott placed him \"among the strongest candidates\" for \"the bridge writer with the greatest creativity in terms of card-play theory\". His 1979 book Adventures in Card Play, written with Hugh Kelsey, introduced and developed many new concepts (such as Backwash squeeze and Entry-shifting squeeze). According to Truscott it \"opened new frontiers\" in defence as well as declarer play. In his 1995 obituary of Kelsey, Truscott wrote that it \"broke new ground in many technical areas and is still considered the most advanced book on the play of the cards.\" An American survey of bridge experts in 2007 ranked it third on a list of their all-time favourites, nearly thirty years after its first publication.American Contract Bridge League, Bridge Bulletin, June 2007, pp. 20\u201322. From October 1944 to February 1945, Ottlik and his wife Gy\u00f6ngyi Debreczeni hid the writer , a Jew, in their apartment and shared their food rations with him. G\u00e9za personally intervened to obtain the release of Vas' mother from arrest; if he had not done so, she would have been sent on a death march towards Germany. Gy\u00f6ngyi faced down a group of Arrow Cross Party members who had broken into the apartment to search for the Jew allegedly hiding there; they left without discovering Vas, who survived World War II. For this, the couple were honoured on 4 June 1998 by Yad Vashem as people Righteous Among the Nations. ==Awards== * Ottlik received a grant from the British Government for his translations, 1960 * J\u00f3zsef Attila Prize (1981) * Kossuth Prize for Literature (1985) * Righteous Among the Nations (1998) ==Publications== * Hamisj\u00e1t\u00e9kosok (Swindlers; stories) (1941) * Hajnali h\u00e1ztet\u0151k (Rooftops at Dawn; novella) (1957) * Iskola a hat\u00e1ron (School at the Frontier; novel) (1959) * Minden megvan (Nothing's Lost; short stories) (1969, revised and enlarged 1991) * Adventures in Card Play, Ottlik and Hugh Kelsey (Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1979), 285 pp., \u2013 on play and defence in bridge * Pr\u00f3za (Prose; essays, interviews) (1980) * A Valencia-rejt\u00e9ly (The Valencia Enigma; novel) (1989) * Haj\u00f3napl\u00f3 (Logbook; novel) (1989) * Buda (novel) (1993) ==References== == External links == * Hungarian Literature database * Biography at Frankfurt '99 with linked \"Publications\" * G\u00e9za Ottlik on Hunlit.hu * * (chiefly linked as 'Ottlik, G\u00e9za, 1912\u2013': select \"LC Online Catalog\", then \"Previous\") Category:Hungarian writers Category:Hungarian contract bridge players Category:Contract bridge writers Category:Writers from Budapest Category:Hungarian noble families Category:1912 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Burials at Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery Category:20th-century Hungarian mathematicians Category:Hungarian Righteous Among the Nations Category:Austro- Hungarian mathematicians ",
