It was taken by the Persians, when they attacked Eretria in 490 BCE, but it is chiefly memorable for the victory which the Athenians, under Phocion, gained here over Callias of Chalcis in 350 BCE.Aesch. c. Ctes. \u00a7\u00a7 85-88, de Fals. Leg. 180; Dem. de Pac. 5; Plat. Phoc. 12.) Its site is located near the modern village of Avlonari. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Euboea Category:Former populated places in Greece ",
