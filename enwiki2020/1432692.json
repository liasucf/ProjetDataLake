    "text": "Peacock Sound is an ice-filled sound, long and wide, separating Thurston Island from the Eights Coast of Ellsworth Land in Antarctica. The sound is occupied by the western part of the Abbot Ice Shelf, and is therefore not navigable by ships. The feature was discovered by members of the USAS in flights from the ship Bear in February 1940, and was further delineated from air photos taken by US Navy Operation Highjump in December 1946. The sound was first noted to parallel the entire south coast of Thurston Island, thereby establishing insularity, by the USN Bellingshausen Sea Expedition in February 1960. Named after the sloop of war Peacock in which Captain William L. Hudson, in company with the tender Flying Fish under Lt. William M. Walker, both of the USEE, 1838\u201342, sailed along the edge of the pack ice to the north of Thurston Island for several days in March 1839. == Further reading == \u2022 Defense Mapping Agency 1992, Sailing Directions (planning Guide) and (enroute) for Antarctica, P 382 \u2022 Andrew J.
