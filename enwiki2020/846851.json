    "text": "Polyphagia or hyperphagia is an abnormally strong sensation of hunger or desire to eat often leading to or accompanied by overeating.https://hpo.jax.org/app/browse/term/HP:0002591 In contrast to an increase in appetite following exercise, polyphagia does not subside after eating and often leads to rapid intake of excessive quantities of food. Polyphagia is not a disorder by itself, rather it is a symptom indicating an underlying medical condition. It is frequently a result of abnormal blood glucose levels (both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia), and, along with polydipsia and polyuria, it is one of the \"3 Ps\" commonly associated with diabetes mellitus.Diabetes.co.ukHealthline.com article \"What are the 3 Ps of Diabetes?\" == Etymology and pronunciation == The word polyphagia () uses combining forms of poly- + -phagia, from the Greek words \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 (polys), \"very much\" or \"many\", and \u03c6\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff6 (phago), \"eating\" or \"devouring\". == Underlying conditions and possible causes == Polyphagia is one of the most common symptoms of diabetes mellitus. It is associated with hyperthyroidism and endocrine diseases, e.g., Graves' disease, and it has also been noted in Prader-Willi syndrome and other genetic conditions caused by chromosomal anomalies. It is only one of several diagnostic criteria for bulimia and is not by itself classified as an eating disorder. As a symptom of Kleine\u2013Levin syndrome, it is sometimes termed megaphagia.MACDONALD CRITCHLEY, PERIODIC HYPERSOMNIA AND MEGAPHAGIA IN ADOLESCENT MALES, Brain, Volume 85, Issue 4, December 1962, Pages 627\u2013656, https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/85.4.627 Knocking out vagal nerve receptors has been shown to cause hyperphagia. According to the National Center for Biomedical Information, polyphagia is found in the following conditions:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/9369 * Chromosome 22q13 duplication syndrome * Chromosome Xq26.3 duplication syndrome * Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 * Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2 * Diabetes mellitus type 1 * Familial renal glucosuria * Frontotemporal dementia * Frontotemporal dementia, ubiquitin-positive * Graves' disease * Hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome * Kleine-Levin syndrome * Leptin deficiency or dysfunction *Leptin receptor deficiency * Luscan-lumish syndrome * Macrosomia adiposa congenita * Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 1 * Obesity, hyperphagia, and developmental delay (OBHD) *Pick's disease *Prader-Willi syndrome * Proopiomelanocortin deficiency * Schaaf-yang syndrome == Polyphagia in diabetes == Diabetes mellitus causes a disruption in the body's ability to transfer glucose from food into energy. Intake of food causes glucose levels to rise without a corresponding increase in energy, which leads to a persistent sensation of hunger. Polyphagia usually occurs early in the course of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, once insulin deficiency becomes more severe and ketoacidosis develops, appetite is suppressed. ==See also== ==References== == External links == * Diseases and conditions associated with Polyphagia Category:Symptoms and signs: Endocrinology, nutrition, and metabolism ",
