    "text": "In English, the phrase fly in the ointment is an idiomatic expression for a drawback, especially one that was not at first apparent, e.g. : We had a cookstove, beans, and plates; the fly in the ointment was the lack of a can opener. The likely source is a phrase in the King James Bible:\"A Fly in the Ointment\" , commentary at website of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco :Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour. (Ecclesiastes ) For four centuries, 'a fly in the ointment' has meant a small defect that spoils something valuable or is a source of annoyance. The modern version thus suggests that something unpleasant may come or has come to light in a proposition or condition that is almost too pleasing; that there is something wrong hidden, unexpected somewhere. ==Sources== * The Fly in the Ointment: 70 Fascinating Commentaries on the Science of Everyday Life by Joseph A.
