This was their second attempt at buying a house in the city. The first time, was in 1948, when because they were black, the price was raised by $3,000 on the spot and \"two other parties were interested in the house\" by the time they arrived to look at the house. and The second time, in 1954, three doctors got together to build homes on Fishcreek Road, using a white contractor to purchase the land. They were the third black family to move in and the first to have children in Stow. In the community, she volunteered while she was staying at home, raising her four children.
