    "text": "Knowledge Channel is a Philippine pay television channel owned by ABS-CBN that consists of educational and informative programs. The channel is available on Sky Cable, Sky Direct and other cable providers. It was also previously available on ABS-CBN TVplus (until June 30, 2020), following an alias cease- and-desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission in connection with the expiration of ABS-CBN franchise. ==History== Elvira \"Rina\" M. L\u00f3pez-Bautista established the non-profit organization Sky Foundation, Inc. in June 1999; it would later be renamed the Knowledge Channel Foundation, Inc. (KCFI) in 2003. The Knowledge Channel began broadcasting on November 6, 1999 with 18 hours of educational programs on cable television that supplemented the curriculum of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (later the Department of Education). The foundation entered into a 10-year memorandum of agreement (MoA) with the department, with the latter proclaiming the channel as required viewing in all public schools in 2000 and has since then renewed its partnership with another 10 year MoA signed in November 2009. KCFI's first two original programs are Kasaysayan TV and Pamana. As of 2019, Rina Bautista is the President and Executive Director of KCFI, with Oscar M. L\u00f3pez as Chairman and Carlo Katigbak as Vice-President. On August 2020, the channel operates at 24 hours. ==Programs== ==References== ===Further reading=== *Lopez Link: \"Knowledge Channel leads change through media, gains support\", March 2010. *Lopez Link: \"Dulany Rockefeller joins Knowledge Channel in \u2018Lead the Change\u2019\", January 2010. ==External links== * * * * Category:1999 establishments in the Philippines Category:ABS-CBN Corporation Category:Assets owned by ABS-CBN Corporation Category:Department of Education (Philippines) Category:Educational and instructional television channels Category:Filipino- language television stations Category:Philippines educational programs Category:Television networks in the Philippines Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 Category:Television in the Philippines ",
