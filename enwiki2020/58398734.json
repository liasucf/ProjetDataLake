When Miss K. E. Murray was appointed as a new Principal, she along with Eleanor Hipwell's successor, Sheila McCririck, developed a collection of contemporary British art that would inform and inspire students. The Collection artists included were Patrick Heron, Stanley Spencer, Henry Moore, Paul Nash, Ivon Hitchens and John Hitchens. The University of Chichester closed the Otter Gallery permanently in October 2018, despite public protests and attempts to save it.https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/30052018-protest- against-closure-of-otter-gallery-in- chichesterhttps://www.chichester.co.uk/news/call-to-keep-chichester- university-s-otter-gallery-as-closure- planned-1-8516117https://www.chichester.co.uk/news/campaigners-lament-closure- of-otter-gallery-at-chichester-university-1-8658915 ==Publications== \u2018The Bishop Otter Art Collection - A Celebration\u2019, edited by Gill Clarke, Sansom & Co., 2016, ==References== Category:University of Chichester Category:Culture in West Sussex Category:Museums in West Sussex Category:Art museums and galleries in England ",
