    "text": "W40CN-D is a low-power Class A television station in Sugar Grove, Illinois, United States. The station is presently silent awaiting construction of its facilities on physical channel 27. ==History== Waubonsee Community College, a community college serving the Aurora area, launched the station on channel 54 as W54BE. Programming included distance education telecourses from the college and a community bulletin board. The station moved to channel 40 in 2008. The college marketed the station as primarily on cable: Comcast channel 99 or 17; Mediacom channel 15; or AT&T; U-Verse channel 99. The college was not able to construct a digital facility for the station, citing severe budget problems with Illinois state funding and the local district's real estate tax base as reasons. In April 2012, the college filed to sell W40CN to Local Media TV Holdings. ==References== ==External links== *Official sites: **Waubonsee Community College telecourses **Watching Waubonsee's Educational Television Channel * Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:Sugar Grove, Illinois Category:Kane County, Illinois Category:Television stations in Illinois ",
