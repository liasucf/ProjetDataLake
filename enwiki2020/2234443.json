    "text": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 5400 Class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive. They were similar in appearance to many other GWR tank engines but smaller than the ubiquitous GWR 5700 Class. The nominally Collett- designed 5400 Class had driving wheels for greater top speed with autocoaches, and were all fitted with the required remote control gear for working the push-pull autotrains. They had a modern cab and a larger bunker. They were frequently seen on inner suburban routes from Paddington. ==History== The 5400 class was related to the 2021 class saddle tank, designed by William Dean and built at Wolverhampton railway works. This was a light compact design with wheels, itself derived from the smaller Armstrong GWR 850 Class dating from 1874. The class pioneer was not a new engine at all, rather it was a 1930 rebuild of 2021 tank 2080. It merely had substitute larger wheels and splashers and a larger bunker, whereas the new locos built from 1931 onwards had the rounded-edge cab as well. This cab style was to be fitted to all subsequent GWR pannier tank designs including the later derivations of the 5700 Class. Despite its success, the prototype had a short life as number 5400, lasting only two years before scrapping. It was replaced with an all-new engine with the same number. 25 locomotives were built and they were numbered 5400-5424. == Withdrawal and mileages == Withdrawal from service with BR started in 1957 and was completed in 1963. {|class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"The table is organized with two rows giving the year and numbers of locomotives withdrawn.\" |+ Withdrawal of 5400s from BR |- !

This produced two general purpose classes with wide route availability. The 6400 was auto-fitted but more suitable for hilly routes than the 5400. The 7400 was not auto-fitted. ==See also== * GWR 0-6-0PT \u2013 list of classes of GWR 0-6-0 pannier tank, including table of preserved locomotives ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== ; 5400 Class * * ; General * Guide to GWR Pannier Tank Classes Category:0-6-0PT locomotives 5400 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1930 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:Scrapped locomotives ",
