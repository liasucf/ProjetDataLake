    "text": "Ralliement national (RN) (in English: \"National Rally\") was a separatist and right-wing populist provincial political party that advocated the political independence of Quebec from Canada in the 1960s. The party was led by former cr\u00e9ditiste Gilles Gr\u00e9goire. Unlike the Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale led by Pierre Bourgault, a left-wing party, the Ralliement national was more right of centre on the political spectrum. The Ralliement national was formed in 1966 following a merger between the Regroupement national (a dissident wing of Bourgault's RIN) and a pro-independence group that broke away from the Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes in 1965. In the 1966 Quebec general election, the Ralliement national and the Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale won about 8.8% of the popular vote and no seats. In 1968, the Ralliement national agreed to merge with Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque's Mouvement souverainet\u00e9-association to form the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois under L\u00e9vesque's leadership. After that, Pierre Bourgault disbanded the RIN and invited its members to join the new PQ. At that point, sovereigntist forces in Quebec were united, and three elections later, the PQ won the 1976 Quebec general election, with historic consequences. ==Election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !General election !# of candidates !# of seats won !% of popular vote |- | align=center | 1966 | align=center | 90 | align=center | 0 | align=center | 3.21% |} ==See also== * Politics of Quebec * List of Quebec general elections * List of Quebec premiers * List of Quebec leaders of the Opposition * National Assembly of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * Political parties in Quebec * Secessionist movements of Canada ==References== ==External links== * National Assembly historical information * La Politique qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise sur le Web Category:Provincial political parties in Quebec Category:Defunct secessionist organizations in Canada Category:Defunct political parties in Canada Category:Political parties established in 1966 ",
