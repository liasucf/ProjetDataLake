Roberts grew up listening to jazz, blues, calypso and flamenco records that his father brought back from business trips abroad.

In the late 1960s, he produced programs about African music for the BBC World Service. Roberts moved to the United States in 1970, where he was an editor for Africa Report. In 1972, Roberts traveled to the Caribbean Islands to make field recordings of traditional music, which were released as Caribbean Island Music: Songs and Dances of Haiti, The Dominican Republic and Jamaica on Nonesuch Records as part of their Explorer Series. In 1972, he published Black Music of Two Worlds, which explored the impact that both African and European cultures had on music of the Americas.
