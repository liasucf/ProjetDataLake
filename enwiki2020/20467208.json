Two years later, he was self-demoted to the rank of Lt., since he was unable to hold the job, and serves as Payne's superior in Homicide. In the film, he is portrayed by Ludacris as a much younger Internal Affairs detective. Although his status is unknown at the end of Max Payne 2 \u2013 he is last seen critically injured in the hospital \u2013 it was revealed in the comic series that predates Max Payne 3 that he survived the events of Max Payne 2, thus making him one of two main characters to survive the ending of that game (three in the hardest difficulty).

In Max Payne he is Mafia underboss Jack Lupino's right-hand man. He is depicted as intelligent but cowardly, with a penchant for abusing sexual partners that include underage addicts and call girls. Payne wounds him and chases him through the streets to interrogate him regarding Jack Lupino's whereabouts, and leaves him alive. In Max Payne 2 he has ascended to the rank of underboss, due to the high number of losses in the family in the first game. He is less threatening this time around, and is again at war with the Russian mob. Going against his Godfathers' wishes, his pleas for help is rejected. He is killed by Vladimir Lem, who detonated a bomb located in a \"Captain Baseball Bat Boy\" costume that Gognitti was wearing at the time. * Vladimir Lem \u2013 Vlad is a suave, old- fashioned Russian mafioso and Woden's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

During the two years following Punchinello's death, he has ascended to the top, becoming a powerful Russian Mafia leader, and even bought Jack Lupino's club, the Ragna Rok, turning it into a fancy restaurant called the Vodka.

Marko Saaresto, vocalist of the Finnish rock band Poets of The Fall, serves as the model for the character in the first game. * Raul Passos \u2013 Passos is Max's partner in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil as a bodyguard. In Max Payne 3 he is paid to find and recruit Max for a job in private security. Max and Passos are paid to protect Rodrigo Bronco and his family when the Comando Sombra attempts to kidnap Rodrigo and his wife, Fabiana, and are able to save them. A couple days later, Passos flies Max, Marcelo, Fabiana, and her sister Giovanna to a nightclub where the Comando Sombra abduct Fabianna and is held for ransom. When Max and Raul try to exchange the ransom money to the Comando Sombra, they are ambushed by a group called Crach\u00e1 Preto and the ransom money is stolen.

Later on, Vladimir Lem reveals to Max that Woden sent the file to her because of her job as an assistant to the D.A, thus making Woden the reason of her death. * Mona Sax \u2013 Mona is a hired killer, and a playable character in the second game.

They become romantically involved whilst investigating a conspiracy; however, in Max Payne 3 it is revealed that Payne regrets their affair. In the conclusion of Max Payne 2 she was killed, leaving Payne aggrieved in the first two difficulties of the game, but survives in the hardest difficulty (making her one of three main characters to survive both of the first two games).
