In 1987, Marco Castaneda was voted the Jack Robinson Memorial Award given annually by the Northern California Turf Writers Association at Bay Meadows Racetrack in San Mateo, California in honor of the widely respected Bay area jockey who died in a racing accident on June 20, 1973 while trying to save a fellow jockey. Retired, Castaneda did not ride in 1995 or 1996 then came back in 1997 but made only 16 starts before retiring permanently having won 3,163 races in the United States and Canada. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Colombian jockeys Category:American jockeys Category:Sportspeople from Bogot\u00e1 Category:Colombian expatriate sportspeople in the United States ",
