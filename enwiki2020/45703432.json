Ambedkar Open University. ==History== ===Hyderabad Public Service Commission=== The early Asaf Jahi rulers of the Hyderabad State followed the Mughal administrative traditions, practices and appointed public servants on the basis of nomination and representation. Sir Salar Jung I, the Diwan (Prime Minister) was the creator of modern Hyderabad Civil Service. In 1882, Salar Jung issued the extraordinary Jareeda and emphasized the need of educating and training the young Hyderabadis for recruitment in the Nizam\u2019s Services. He propounded the idea of building an efficient administrative system on the model of British India and introduced several administrative reforms. He dismantled the old/archaic administrative structure and streamlined the public institutions by creating a distinct civil service class. The establishment of Zilabandi system, creation of Subedari and Taluqdari system, Revenue, Police and Judicial reforms by Salar Jung facilitated the formation of Hyderabad Civil Service. Subsequently, the proclamation of Qanuncha Mubarik of 1892, the Cabinet Council, and the Executive Council (1919) framed rules and regulations governing the services as well as regulated and institutionalized the Hyderabad Civil Services. In 1938, through a resolution of the Executive Council a Committee was constituted composed of all Secretaries to Government with the Finance Member as the President and an officer of the Finance Department as Secretary to examine the possibility and role of an agency or agencies for recruitment and appointment and its/their sphere(s) of action. After detailed discussion, it was recommended to establish an independent and impartial recruitment agency, known as the Hyderabad Public Service Commission. The Committee opined that \"the efficiency of an administration depends on its personnel. It is therefore evident that the procedure of recruitment especially for the higher services of the administration, play an important role in creating and maintaining its standard and efficiency. Accordingly, the Hyderabad Public Service Commission was established by a Firman on 27 April 1947. It brought the entire administrative machinery of civil services of the Nizam\u2019s State in tune with the modern times. The Hyderabad Civil Service, was a coveted service in the State of Hyderabad. It was considered to be an elite service, and the best of the government officers were inducted into it through a competitive examination. It was abolished after the Police Action in 1948 and its Officers were absorbed into the Indian government civil services. Hyderabad Civil Service Committee was established and as a personnel agency it played a significant role in the management of civil services. It was independent in its functioning and no attempt was made to bring pressure on the decision- making process of the Committee. It was a multifunctional agency and closely associated with all aspects of Hyderabad Civil Service. It had to conduct examinations for the selection and placement of the candidates for the various vacancies in different departments. The Hyderabad Public Service Commission was constituted on the model of British Provincial Public Service Commission with similar functions. It consisted of a Chairman and Members not exceeding four in number. They were appointed by His Highness the Nizam on the recommendation of the President of the Executive Council. The Chairman and Members of the Hyderabad Public Service Commission were not permitted to further employment after relinquishing their office. The Public Commission established by the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan in 1947 became the forerunner of the Hyderabad Public Service Commission under the Constitution of India, during the period of Burgula Ramakrishna Rao, the first elected Chief Minister of Hyderabad State. The Hyderabad Public Service Commission was finally merged into the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission in 1956. Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission was in existence until the united Andhra Pradesh State was bifurcated into Telangana State and AP State in accordance with AP Reorganization Act, 2014. ===Formation of Telangana State and constitution of TSPSC=== According to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 the Telangana State came into existence with effect from the appointed day i.e., 02.06.2014.
