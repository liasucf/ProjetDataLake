    "text": "Undying Light is the fourth studio album by American death metal band Fallujah, released on March 15, 2019. It was the first album to feature Antonio Palermo as lead singer, replacing Alex Hofmann after he left the band in 2017. It was produced by guitarist Scott Carstairs and Mark Lewis at OHMNI Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. == Critical reception == The album received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Metal Storm gave the album a 5.8/10, saying \"It's not a bad album, it's just entirely unremarkable, which is a crying shame for a band that managed to really distinguish themselves in what can be quite a repetitive sub-genre\". Metal Injection gave the album a negative review, critiquing the album's production, the simplistic songwriting and song structure compared to past releases, and Palermo's vocal performance, writing \"Undying Light isn\u2019t a mixed bag or a slight misstep. It is a genuinely bad record that even diehard fans will have difficulty sitting through. Of course, this is hardly irredeemable. Fallujah has talented musicians and the band has produced great music before. But if Undying Light is a sign of things to come, it\u2019s a fairly dire one. == Track listing == All song lyrics written by Antonio Palermo and instrumentally composed by Scott Carstairs. ==Personnel== ===Fallujah=== * Antonio Palermo \u2013 vocals, programming * Scott Carstairs \u2013 guitars * Robert Morey \u2013 bass * Andrew Baird \u2013 drums ===Production=== * Scott Carstairs \u2013 guitar, bass * Mark Lewis \u2013 drums, vocals ===Design and artwork=== * Nick Keller \u2013 cover art == References == Category:2019 albums Category:Fallujah (band) albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums ",
