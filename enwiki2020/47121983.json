    "text": "The Urswick School is a co-educational secondary school and sixth form located in the Hackney Central area of the London Borough of Hackney, England. The school is named after Christopher Urswick, the Rector of the Parish of Hackney from 1502 to 1522, and a close friend of King Henry VII and his mother, Margaret Beaufort. It was established in 1520 as Hackney Free School. In 1722, it joined with a parochial charity school to form Hackney Free and Parochial School. The school moved to its present location after 1856. The school was significantly rebuilt and expanded in 2011 and was renamed The Urswick School. Today it is a voluntary aided school administered by Hackney London Borough Council and the Church of England Diocese of London. The Urswick School offers GCSEs, BTECs and ASDAN awards as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs and ASDAN awards. ==References== ==External links== *The Urswick School official website Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Hackney Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of London Category:Educational institutions established in the 1520s Category:1520 establishments in England Category:Voluntary aided schools in London Category:Hackney, London ",
