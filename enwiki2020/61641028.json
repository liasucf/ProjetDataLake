    "text": "Matthias Finucane (1737-1814) was an Irish barrister and judge of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He is notable chiefly for divorcing his wife, an unusual step for a judge to take at the time.Ball p.228 ==Career == He was born in Ennis, County Clare, the only son of Andrew Finucane and Joanna Hewitt.Ball p.228 Though his father was described as an apothecary,Bal p.228 which was then considered to be socially a rather humble occupation, Andrew, who was born in 1680, seems to have been a man of some wealth. Matthias went to Trinity College Dublin, where he matriculated in 1755, and entered Middle Temple in 1759. Ball p.228He was called to the Irish Bar in 1764 and became King's Counsel in 1784. He was a member of the well-known drinking club called The Monks of the Screw (or the Order of St. Patrick) founded by John Philpot Curran in about 1780. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1794, having been originally intended for the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). Ball p.188 Though he is said to have owed his appointment to his friendship with John Fitzgibbon, 1st Earl of Clare, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, he was highly regarded as a judge. William Norcott, the barrister and poet, in his poem The Metropolis, praised him for his honesty and commonsense. Ball p.248- He presided at a number of the trials resulting from the Irish Rebellion of 1798. After the failure of the Irish rebellion of 1803, he was one of the members of the Special Commission which was set up to try the rebels. He retired in 1806 and died in County Clare in 1814.Ball p.228 He divided his time between his Dublin town house in Kildare Street, his estate at Lifford, County Clare, and Ennistymon House, which belonged to him through marriage. Ennistymon House, which Finucane acquired by marriage ==Family == In 1775 he married Anne, daughter of Edward O'Brien of Ennistymon, County Clare and his wife Susanna; she was only about sixteen at the time of the marriage. Ball p.228 They had three children: Andrew, the only son and heir, Susanna who married the politician William Nugent Macnamara, and Jane who married her cousin James Finucane. ==Divorce == The marriage was clearly an unhappy one: both husband and wife had love affairs, and the judge fathered several illegitimate children, including John, who was mentioned in his half-brother Andrew's will. According to a long standing family tradition, the Guernsey based portraitist Matthias Finucane (died 1810), who was apparently Irish by birth, was another of the judge's illegitimate children. In 1793 the judge divorced Anne by a private Act of Parliament\"33 George III c.9P\" on the grounds of her adultery with his cousin Lieutenant Donal Finucane. Ball p.228 The Act was eventually repealed in 2012, under the Statute Law Revision Act 2012. \"Obsolete Acts of the British Parliament to be repealed\" Irish Times May 10, 2012 Anne and Donal subsequently married and had several children: she died at Boulogne in 1844. Although the Act explicitly allowed Matthias to remarry, he never did so.Irish Times May 10, 2012 The judge's son Andrew had no issue, and on his death in 1843 the family estates passed to the heirs of his sister Susanna Macnamara, who died in 1819. Among her descendants was the author Caitlin Thomas, who married the celebrated poet Dylan Thomas. ==Sources== *Ball, F.
