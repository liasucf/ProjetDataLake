She is a professor at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University. == Early life and education == Nesrin \u00d6z\u00f6ren was born on July 25, 1972 in the in Silistra Province, Bulgaria.

In 2002, \u00d6z\u00f6ren earned a Ph.D. in the department of biology at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts & Sciences. Her thesis was titled, Involvement of TRAIL-Death Receptors in Human Tumorigenesis and Mechanisms of TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis Signaling. Her doctoral advisor was Wafik El-Deiry. From July 2002 to June 2005, \u00d6z\u00f6ren was a postdoctoral researcher at the in the department of pathology at the University of Michigan. Her advisor was Gabriel N\u00fa\u00f1ez. == Career and research == In August 2005, \u00d6z\u00f6ren joined the faculty at the Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University's department of molecular biology and genetics as an assistant professor. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and professor in 2015. \u00d6z\u00f6ren serves in leadership roles including vice president and president of the . She is a founding member of the . \u00d6z\u00f6ren researches vaccines, apoptosis, innate immune signaling, Beh\u00e7et's disease, and melanomas. In 2018, her invention, \"Microsphere Technology for Durable Vaccine Carrying Proteins\" became the first triadic patent in the field of biotechnology in Turkey. In 2020, \u00d6z\u00f6ren is leading a team to develop a COVID-19 vaccine based on her patented technology. == Controversy == In October 2019, Nesrin \u00d6z\u00f6ren posted a number of tweets with homophobic and transphobic content, where she described LGBTIQ+ individuals as \"exhibitionists who define their existence with their bedrooms\" and as \"people who do not like their chromosome sets and wage a war against biology.\" She also claimed that \"people who are biologically gay are very few, but their impact is ten times more than their number\" and \"there are people who are gay or lesbian because it is fashionable.\" \u00d6z\u00f6ren also stated that she would not mind even if the entire United States or China is gay, but she would never want it to be fashionable in Turkey. Students who interpreted \u00d6z\u00f6ren's comments to be in conflict with Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University's ethics principles concerning gender and sexuality, and potentially harmful to the University's reputation as a scientific institution reported the incident to the administration. The University Rector Mehmed \u00d6zkan, however, did not allow the Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University Committee on Ethical Conduct in Extramural Academic Relations to evaluate the incident. == References == == External links == * Category:1972 births Category:People from Silistra Province Category:Bulgarian Turks in Turkey Category:Bulgarian women scientists Category:Bulgarian biologists Category:Women molecular biologists Category:Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University alumni Category:Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University faculty Category:Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:21st-century women scientists Category:21st-century biologists Category:Turkish medical researchers Category:Women medical researchers Category:21st-century Bulgarian scientists Category:Turkish women scientists Category:Turkish molecular biologists Category:Living people ",
