At first, in Auckland, he played rugby league. He played rugby union from the age of 15 when he went to St Peter's College, Auckland the same Catholic school attended by Pat Lam who also taught there. In his final year at school, in 2000, the team went through the season undefeated, winning the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition. The team was inspired by Pat Lam.\"The Saint who has date with destiny\", The Independent (UK), 10 April 2011, pp. 1 and 17. (retrieved 3 May 2011) In 2001, Tonga\u2019uiha joined the Ponsonby rugby club in Auckland.where he was selected for the Auckland Colts side, playing one game against Japan. Tonga\u2019uiha was selected for the Auckland team in 2002 and 2003, playing 12 games and scoring one try. He first made his break at Bedford Blues as he shone in the 2005/06 season, helping Bedford to a second-place finish behind rugby giants Harlequins, and a Powergen Trophy final place. This, combined with his mobile aggressive ball-carrying, caused Northampton Saints to consider using him. He had also scored a try against Saints in Northampton's victory over Bedford Blues in the Powergen Cup game in December 2004. Tonga'uiha moved to Northampton Saints at the start of the 2006/07 season and at first \u2013 being behind Scotland and British and Irish Lions legend Tom Smith- did not have too many starts in the Guinness Premiership. However, in the 2007/08 season, when Saints found themselves in National League 1, he excelled and earned a number of first team appearances as Northampton Saints cruised towards promotion at the end of the season. This upward trend in performances continued into the 2008/09 season when \u2013 combined with Tom Smith's move towards coaching \u2013 Tonga'uiha cemented his place in the match-day squad and has had his fair share of appearances in the starting XV. Tonga'uiha became something of a crowd favourite at Franklin's Gardens with the nickname 'Tiny' \u2013 an ironic take on his size. On 27 January 2010, it was announced that Tonga'uiha would join Saracens at the start of the 2010/11 season. However, in April 2010, he changed his mind and signed a new three-year contract with the Saints. Soane Tonga'uiha left the Saints at the end of the season 2012-2013 to join the Top 14 Paris club Racing Metro. On 16 May 2014, Soane left Racing Metro to join Top 14 rivals Oyonnax from the 2014-15 season. On 30 June 2016, Tonga'uiha returned to England to join new Aviva Premiership side Bristol Rugby on a two-year deal, prior to the 2016-17 season. He was released by Bristol in April 2018.

His sights had been firmly set on the 2007 Rugby World Cup to be held in France \u2013 ensuring his and other seasoned professionals playing Europe's participation.
