    "text": "was a Japanese mass murderer who killed eight people in the Osaka school massacre in Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture on 8 June 2001. Takuma had a long history of mentally disturbed and anti-social behavior, and an extensive criminal record including a conviction for rape. He stabbed to death eight students and seriously wounded fifteen others at Ikeda Elementary School in a knife attack that lasted several minutes. Takuma was convicted in August 2003 and executed on 14 September 2004. == Early life == Mamoru Takuma was born on 23 November 1963 in Itami, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, Japan. As a child, he displayed unusual and anti-social behavior, including blocking traffic on highways and setting fire to cats. During his second year of high school, Takuma reportedly attacked a teacher and ran away from home for several months. Takuma dropped out of school and got into a physical confrontation with his father, who tried to seek psychiatric help for him as a result. After the hospital refused to treat Takuma, his father disowned him. Takuma worked at a gas station for several months until enlisting in the Japan Air Self Defense Force, but was discharged a year later for having sexual intercourse with a minor. In 1984, Takuma and his mother left his family house and purchased an apartment, leaving his oldest brother and father by themselves. They lived together for a year and a half, until his father came back for his wife. == Criminal history == In November 1984, Takuma was arrested for raping a woman while collecting rent for a condominium management company, and sentenced to three years in prison. Takuma was detained at a juvenile detention center in Nara from 1986 to 1989. Takuma was also arrested for driving his car in reverse gear on the Hanshin Expressway but released after he was found mentally unfit. After his release from prison, Takuma moved to Ikeda and found work as a bus driver and garbage truck driver. Takuma's coworkers described him as a quiet and unremarkable man, but a bit of a loner who did not like dealing with customers. In 1998, Takuma was fired after assaulting a passenger over the smell of her perfume. Takuma found a new job as maintenance man at Itami Elementary School, 6 kilometers away from Ikeda. On 3 March 1999, Takuma dissolved some of his own tranquilizer, temazepam, into the tea served in the teachers' room at Itami Elementary School, sending 4 people to the hospital. Takuma was arrested and sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and later jumped from the roof of the psychiatric hospital in an attempt to commit suicide but failed. After one month's treatment, Takuma was judged to be \"capable of taking care of himself\". After his release from the psychiatric hospital, Takuna continued to display odd behavior, stating that he was a survivor of the Japan Airlines Flight 123 crash. In November 1999, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of entering a private home, but the charges were dropped. Takuma managed to get a job as a taxi driver in September 2000, but was fired on October 16 after he assaulted a hotel bellhop in Osaka and broke the bellhop's nose. Takuma was also kicked out of several apartments for, among other things, throwing his garbage out from the balcony. On 23 May 2001, Takuma voluntarily admitted himself into a psychiatric hospital for depression, but left the next day without treatment. Takuma was arrested at least eleven times and had married four times before June 2001. In October 1998, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his ex-wife. == Massacre == On 8 June 2001, the day of his court hearing for the bellhop assault case, Takuma went on a murderous rampage in the Ikeda Elementary School where he had worked as a janitor. Takuma began to attack students and staff with a kitchen knife until he was wrestled down by staff within minutes. In the quick attack, Takuma killed eight students (seven 8-year-old girls and one 7-year-old boy) and seriously wounded thirteen other children and two teachers. Takuma was described as being in an extremely confused state when arrested, at first repeating \"I went to the elementary school\", and then saying \"I went to the train station and stabbed 100 people with my knife. I did not go to the elementary school.\" Takuma also stated: :\u300c\u4f55\u3082\u304b\u3082\u5acc\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u4f55\u56de\u3082\u81ea\u6bba\u3092\u56f3\u3063\u305f\u304c\u6b7b\u306b\u304d\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\u6355\u307e\u3048\u3066\u6b7b\u5211\u306b\u3057\u3066\u307b\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u300d : Nani mo kamo iya ni natta. Nankai mo jisatsu wo hakatta ga shi ni kirenai. Tsukamaete shikei ni shite hoshikatta. : \"I've become disgusted with everything. I've tried to kill myself several times, but couldn't. I wanted to be caught and be given a death sentence.\" Takuma also hated \"elite\" children who attended Ikeda Elementary School. == Trial and execution == Takuma's lawyers argued that he was suffering from temporary insanity at the time of the attack, but the psychiatrist who had initially diagnosed Takuma as schizophrenic told the court he later determined that Takuma actually had paranoid personality disorder. At one point, Takuma claimed to have been influenced by the Shimonoseki Station massacre that occurred two years earlier and sought to imitate it himself. On August 28, 2003, Takuma was found guilty of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to death. Takuma remained unrepentant, refusing to apologize to the families of the victims, and asked only for the sentence to be fulfilled as fast as possible. In court, Takuma engaged in intentionally provocative behavior, including yawning, shaking his body, and staring at victims' family members. His statement was, \"I should have used gasoline, so I could have killed more than I did.\" On the last day of the trial, Takuma still expressed no guilt or remorse, and continued to insult the victims' families until the judge removed him. The sentence was carried out unusually quickly by Japanese standards (condemned prisoners in Japan usually spend many years on death row), and Takuma was executed by hanging only a year later at the Osaka Detention House on September 14, 2004. ==Influence== Kaoru Kobayashi, who sexually assaulted and murdered 7-year-old Kaede Ariyama in Nara in November 2004, considered Takuma to be a charismatic murderer and sought a speedy execution like him. Kobayashi said: ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Takuma Mamoru * https://web.archive.org/web/20071228095650/http://gonta13.at.infoseek.co.jp/newpage203.htm * http://yabusaka.moo.jp/ikeda.htm Category:1963 births Category:2004 deaths Category:2001 crimes in Japan Category:20th-century criminals Category:21st- century criminals Category:21st-century executions by Japan Category:Executed Japanese people Category:Executed mass murderers Category:Japanese mass murderers Category:Japanese murderers of children Category:Japanese people convicted of murder Category:Japanese rapists Category:People convicted of murder by Japan Category:People convicted of rape Category:People executed by Japan by hanging Category:People from Hy\u014dgo Prefecture Category:People with paranoid personality disorder Category:2004 murders in Asia Category:2000s murders in Japan Category:Japanese taxicab drivers Category:Bus drivers ",
