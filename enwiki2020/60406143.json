    "text": "Song Sun (, born in 1987) is a Chinese mathematician whose research concerns geometry and topology. A Sloan Research Fellow and a laureate of the 2019 Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry, he has been an associate professor at the Department of Mathematics of the University of California, Berkeley since 2018. == Biography == Sun attended Huaining High School in Huaining County, Anhui, China, before being admitted to the Special Class for the Gifted Young at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2002. After graduating from the program with a B.S. in 2006, he moved to the United States to pursue graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, obtaining his Ph.D in mathematics (differential geometry) in 2010. His doctoral advisor was Xiuxiong Chen, and his dissertation was titled \"Kempf\u2013Ness theorem and uniqueness of extremal metrics\". Sun worked as a research associate at Imperial College London before becoming an assistant professor at Stony Brook University in 2013. He was awarded the Sloan Research Fellowship in 2014. In 2018, he was appointed an associate professor at the Department of Mathematics of the University of California, Berkeley. He was an invited speaker at the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians, in Rio de Janeiro. For 2021 he received the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics - New Horizons in Mathematics.Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics 2021 == Conjecture on Fano manifolds and Veblen Prize == In 2019, Sun was awarded the prestigious Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry, together with his former advisor Xiuxiong Chen and Simon Donaldson, for proving a long-standing conjecture on Fano manifolds, which states that \"a Fano manifold admits a K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable\". It had been one of the most actively investigated topics in geometry since a rough version of it was conjectured in the 1980s by Shing- Tung Yau, who had previously proved the Calabi conjecture. The conjecture was later given a precise formulation by Donaldson, based in part on earlier work of Gang Tian. The solution by Chen, Donaldson and Sun was published in the Journal of the American Mathematical Society in 2015 as a three-article series, \"K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, I, II and III\". == Major publications == * * * * == References == Category:Living people Category:21st- century Chinese mathematicians Category:Differential geometers Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:University of Science and Technology of China alumni Category:University of Wisconsin- Madison alumni Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Stony Brook University faculty Category:Mathematicians from Anhui Category:People from Huaining County Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Sloan Research Fellows ",
