    "text": "Best Buddies Australia (BBA) is a not for profit organisation (NGO) with a primary focus of providing socially inclusive friendships to people who have an intellectual disability. ==History== BBA's history originates with Best Buddies International. During 2004, BBI approached the New South Wales Council for Intellectual Disability, offering a creative and innovate program for adults and young people who have an intellectual disability. Coincidentally, a staff member from Melbourne Big Brothers Big Sisters approached BBI at the same time asking to bring the program to Australia. After securing a modest grant from the New South Wales Government, BBA became incorporated in November 2004. The initial program focused on High School Students located in NSW and the provision of an independent Best Buddies Victoria Program focusing on Citizens (Adults). During 2007 additional funds were located and the organisation recruited its first Executive Director, Mark Trevaskis. In the following years, Best Buddies Australia has grown substantially, incorporating Victoria into a National framework. ==Programs== Best Buddies Australia delivered two key programs, the High Schools and the Citizens Programs. BBA High Schools is primarily focused on Public High Schools located in Sydney, New South Wales. Each High School creates a Chapter led by a small team of student leaders. These roles include Chapter President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Buddy Director. Beyond the individual volunteer commitment, Best Buddies Chapters are required to deliver 4 additional group events across the year. These may include group meals, fund raisers or activities. The BBA Citizens Program is delivered in both Victoria and New South Wales and focuses on adults who have an intellectual disability. ==Best Buddies Day== Each year Best Buddies Australia holds a Best Buddies Day celebration. This is a unique event bringing together all young people involved in the program. The event itself is activity based with the aim of not only enjoying and celebrating the volunteer commitment of the young people involved but a vehicle to engage the broader community and develop skills. Best Buddies Day has been sponsored by the Bank of New York Mellon during 2010 and 2011. ==Best Buddy Pair of the Year Award== The BBA Best Buddy Pair of the Year Award is a special award granted to the buddy pair who demonstrate the best friendship. The applicants are asked to provide detail as to frequency of contact, types of activities engaged in and additional detail as to what their friendship is like. This award has been sponsored by Redballoon with first prize being a flight over Sydney in a helicopter. Category:Disability organisations based in Australia ",
