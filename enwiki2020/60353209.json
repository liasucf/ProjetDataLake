    "text": "Joan Henley (2 September 1904 \u2013 10 February 1986) was an Irish actress and radio presenter. She was active on the London stage since at least 1927 in inguenue roles, and appeared there throughout the 1930s. Her first film role was a supporting part in Purse Strings in 1933. She had a career of over 50 years in film and television, but her appearances were seldom and mostly small because she concentrated on the stage and her private life. She is probably best known for her role as the friendly spinster Teresa Alan in the Oscar- winning romance film A Room with a View, which was released less than a year before her death. Joan Henley married Bruce Belfrage in 1930 and they had a son, Julian Belfrage, who became an actor's agent. After her divorce from Belfrage, she was married to author Laurence Meynell from 1956 until her death. == Filmography == * Purse Strings (1933) as Ida Bentley * Charley's Aunt (1938 TV movie) as Donna Lucia * School for Randle (1949) in a minor role * Reluctant Heroes (1951) in a minor role * The Common Room (1959 TV series, one episode) * Peridot Flight (1960 TV series, three episodes) * The Reckoning (1970) as Mrs. Reynolds * The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (1971 TV series, one episode) * Follow Me! as Dinner Guest * Hadleigh (1973 TV series, one episode) * Dial M for Murder (1974 TV series, one episode) * Days of Hope (1975 TV mini series, one episode) * Armchair Thriller (1978 TV series, one episode) * The Thirty Nine Steps (1978) as Lady Nettleship * A Room with a View (1985) as Miss Teresa Alan * The Good Doctor Bodkin-Adams (1986 TV movie) as Mrs. Morrell * Shades of Love: Sincerely, Violet (1987) as Maggie == References == == External links == * Category:1904 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Irish stage actresses Category:Irish television actresses Category:Irish film actresses Category:20th-century Irish actresses ",
