Other accounts connect it with Edmund de Mortimer, 5th Earl of March and 7th Earl of Ulster (1391\u20131425), who was born at New Forest near Tyrrellspass. A local legend said that a large amount of gold was buried in a cellar on the site, guarded by a black cat. ==Building== A large Anglo-Norman castle stood on the site, in dimensions. The remains of a two-storey stone tower are in the northwest corner.http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/5079/1/Aidan_O'Sullivan_Vol_1_20140624090451.pdf ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Westmeath Category:Castles in County Westmeath ",
