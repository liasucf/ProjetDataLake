    "text": "This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in the Winnipeg area. ==Regional profile== The city of Winnipeg has traditionally been a mixed bag, in which all three major parties have bases of support. The northern part of the city is a very left-leaning area which has some of the strongest New Democratic Party support in all of Canada. The south end (with many Jewish and Franco-Manitoban voters) is one of the few areas in the Prairies where the Liberals have been successful since the 1990s. The outer suburban areas tilt rightward, but this was obscured for most of the 1990s by massive vote- splitting. The end of vote-splitting on the right allowed the Conservatives to win two seats in 2004, in one case defeating a star candidate. The Conservatives picked up another seat in 2006, one more in 2008 and two additional seats in 2011\u2014including Elmwood-Transcona, the former seat of longtime NDP MP and former deputy leader Bill Blaikie. In 2015, however, the Liberals took all but one seat in Winnipeg en route to their second-largest seat count ever. The only seat that didn't get swept up in the Liberal tide was Elmwood-Transcona, where Blaikie's son Daniel Blaikie narrowly retook the seat for the NDP. It was the first time since 1968, and only the second time since the end of World War II, that the centre-right has been completely shut out of Winnipeg in the absence of vote-splitting. The Tories managed to pick up two outer suburban seats in 2019. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Charleswood-St. James- Assiniboia #Elmwood-Transcona #Kildonan-St. Paul #Saint Boniface #Winnipeg Centre #Winnipeg North #Winnipeg South #Winnipeg South Centre Image:wgcpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada Image:wggpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada Image:wglpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada Image:wgndp.PNG|New Democratic Party Category:Canadian federal election results in Manitoba ",
