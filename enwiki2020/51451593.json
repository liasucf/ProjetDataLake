Originally, the symbol was used by World War I pilot Francesco Baracca on his airplane. ==History== Enzo Ferrari was a racing driver for Alfa Romeo in the earlier decades of the twentieth century. Following one of his wins at the Targa Florio, he met Francesco Baracca's parents, who told him that their son used to paint a prancing horse on his airplane and suggested that if Ferrari applied the horse on his cars, he would have good luck.Enzo Ferrari: Una leggenda a fumetti, Quattroruote comic book by Editoriale Domus. Ferrari took their advice and started to use the black Prancing Horse on a yellow background (yellow being one of the colours of the city flag of his native Modena) as the official Ferrari logo. Initially, all Scuderia Ferrari's cars were manufactured by Alfa Romeo, but after the foundation of Auto Avio Costruzioni (later known as \"Ferrari\"), Ferrari began to use his Ferrari cars. ==Uses== The Prancing Horse is used as part of Ferrari and Scuderia Ferrari logos, on tifosi's flags and as a Ferrari symbol. ==References== Category:Ferrari Category:Coats of arms with horses ",
