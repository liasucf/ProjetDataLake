Paul Huillard (1875\u20131966) collaborated with S\u00fce on the project. The engineer was L. Bogaerts. Gustave Louis Jaulmes (1873\u20131959) decorated the interior. During World War II (1939\u201345) the Belgian fascist leader L\u00e9on Degrelle occupied the chateau. In September\u2013October 1944 Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands made it his base. The Dutchman Christiaan Lindemans, known as King Kong due to his physique, had served the British secret service for four years before offering his services to the Germans. He was arrested at the Chateau Wittouck on 28 October 1944 on suspicion that he had betrayed the attack on Arnhem. The charge was almost certainly false. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * Category:Castles in Belgium Category:Castles in Brussels Chateau de La Fougeraie ",
