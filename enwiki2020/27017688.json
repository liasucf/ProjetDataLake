    "text": "Kapedo is a trading center in Turkana East Sub-County of Turkana County Government, in Kenya's former Rift Valley Province. It is a four-hour drive from Nakuru town. Administratively, it is headed by a chief (National Government), to be assisted by a village administrator (recruited by the County Government of Turkana). The village lies to the West of Mount Silale in the floor of the Great Rift Valley at the head of the Suguta Valley. The Suguta River emanates from hot springs just east of the village, and is joined by the Kapedo River flowing from the West. The village, occupied by Turkana people and traces of Pokot people (living in squalor of a slum) is in a hot semi-desert area. Most houses are semi-permanent, made of iron sheets on roof and mud on the walls. There are also houses made of mud and palm leaves. However, due to the prospective LAPPSET, the village has a number of permanent house. Kapedo is a trading center with a few shops selling basic goods such as flour, tea, sugar and kerosene. There is very little agricultural land, so the people mainly depend on raising Cows, goats, sheep and camels. Conflict with the neighbouring Pokot people creates risk in herding. The village is home to three learning institutions: Kapedo Mixed Boarding Primary School, Kapedo Girls Primary School and the Kapedo Mixed Secondary School, which was completed and had a staff of eight, mostly BOM teachers over 180 pupils. The capacity of the school is much higher but few students can afford even the modest fees. As of 2011 the Kapedo Sub-District Hospital had 28 beds and four cots. It provided in-patient and out-patient services related to maternity, HIV and tuberculosis. Kapedo has high potential but it is limited mostly due to the defunct hydro-electric power plant that has been desolate for years since the departure of the Finnish missionaries. The 'mission' coined for the Kapedo Mixed Primary School, Hospital, Full Gospel Church, the garage and the guest house were the heavily hit after the redundancy of the HEP project. Due to insecurity from the neighboring Turkana community and being a border village, Kapedo is a host to a platoon of General Service Unit, an Administration Police camp and a number of National Police Reservists. ==References== Category:Populated places in Turkana County ",
