    "text": "Palghat P. Vaidyanathan (born in Kolkata, India on 16 October 1954) is the Kiyo and Eiko Tomiyasu Professor of Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA, where he teaches and leads research in the area of signal processing, especially digital signal processing (DSP), and its applications. He has authored four books, and authored or coauthored close to five hundred papers in various IEEE journals and conferences. Prof. Vaidyanathan received his B.Tech and M. Tech degrees from the Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics, University of Kolkata, and a Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from University of California Santa Barbara in 1982. Prof. Vaidyanathan's pioneering contributions include the development of the theory and structures for filter banks, * P. P.
