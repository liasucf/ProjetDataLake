    "text": "Buddhist verse by Ikky\u016b was an eccentric, iconoclastic Japanese Zen Buddhist monk and poet. He had a great impact on the infusion of Japanese art and literature with Zen attitudes and ideals.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, entry \"Ikky\u016b\" by James H. Sanford ==Biography== ===Childhood=== Ikky\u016b was born in 1394 in a small suburb of Kyoto. It is generally held that he was the son of Emperor Go-Komatsu and a low-ranking court noblewoman. His mother was forced to flee to Saga (\u5d6f\u5ce8), where Ikky\u016b was raised by servants. At the age of five, Ikky\u016b was separated from his mother and placed in a Rinzai Zen temple in Kyoto called Ankoku-ji, as an acolyte. The temple masters taught Chinese culture and language as part of the curriculum, a method termed Gozan Zen. He was given the name Shuken, and learned about Chinese poetry, art and literature. ===Training=== When Ikky\u016b turned thirteen he entered Kennin-ji in Kyoto to study Zen under a well known priest by the name of Botetsu. Here Ikky\u016b began to write poetry frequently that was non-traditional in form. He was openly critical of Kennin-ji's leadership in his poetry, disheartened with the social stratum and lack of zazen practice he saw around him. In 1410, at the age of sixteen, Ikky\u016b left Kennin-ji and entered the temple Mibu-dera, where an abbot named Seiso was in residence. He did not stay long, and soon found himself at Saikin-ji in the Lake Biwa region where he was the sole student of an abbot named Ken'o. It seemed Ikky\u016b had finally found a master that taught true Rinzai Zen as Ikky\u016b saw it. Ken'o was sporadic in his teaching style and was a strong believer in the supremacy of zazen. In 1414, when Ikky\u016b was 21, Ken'o died. Ikky\u016b performed funeral rites and fasted for seven days. In despair Ikky\u016b tried to kill himself by drowning himself in Lake Biwa, but was talked out of it from the shore by a servant of his mother. Ikky\u016b soon found a new teacher in a master named Kaso at Zenko-an, a branch temple of Daitoku-ji. Kaso was much like Ken'o in his style. For years he worked hard on assigned k\u014dans and made dolls for a local merchant in Kyoto. In 1418 Ikky\u016b was given Case 15 of the Mumonkan, (\"The Gateless Gate\", a famous set of 49 k\u014dans), known as \"Tozan's Three (or 60?) Blows\", which depicts Tozan becoming enlightened when Ummon rebukes him for wandering from one monastery to another. One day a band of blind singers performed at the temple and Ikky\u016b penetrated his koan while engrossed in the music. In recognition of his understanding Kaso gave Shuken the Dharma name Ikky\u016b, which roughly means One Pause. In 1420 Ikky\u016b was meditating in a boat on Lake Biwa when the sound of a crow sparked satori. Kaso confirmed this great enlightenment and granted Ikky\u016b inka. Ikky\u016b came up against the jealousy of Yoso, a more senior student who eventually came to run the monastery. In Ikky\u016b's poems, Yoso appears as a character unhealthily obsessed with material goods, who sold Zen to increase the prosperity of the temple. Ikkyu is a main character for TVB Hong Kong Television Chinese History Drama Series Character Chinese name She Shi Man \u4f59\u8bd7\u66fc, known as Yu Shi Man. ===Vagabond=== Ikky\u016b could sometimes be a troublemaker. Known to drink in excess, he would often upset Kaso with his remarks and actions to guests. In response, Kaso gave inka to Yoso and made him Dharma heir. Ikky\u016b quickly left the temple and lived many years as a vagabond. He was not alone, however, as he had a regular circle of notable artists and poets from that era. Around this time, he established a relationship with a blind singer, Mori, who became the love of his later life. Ikky\u016b worked to live Zen outside of formal religious institutions. However, the \u014cnin War had reduced Daitokuji to ashes, and Ikky\u016b was elected abbot late in life, a role he reluctantly took on. This firmly placed him in one of the most important Zen lineages. In 1481, Ikky\u016b died at the age of eighty-seven from acute ague. ==Impact== Ikky\u016b is one of the most significant (and eccentric) figures in Zen history. To Japanese children, he is a folk hero, mischievous and always outsmarting his teachers and the sh\u014dgun. In addition to passed down oral stories, this is due to the very popular animated TV series Ikky\u016b-san. In Rinzai Zen tradition, he is both heretic and saint. Ikky\u016b was among the few Zen priests who argued that his enlightenment was deepened by consorting with pavilion girls. He entered brothels wearing his black robes, since for him sexual intercourse was a religious rite. At the same time he warned Zen against its own bureaucratic politicising. Usually he is referred to as one of the main influences on the Fuke sect of Rinzai zen, as he is one of the most famous flute player mendicants of the medieval times of Japan. The piece \"Murasaki Reibo\" is attributed to him. He is credited as one of the great influences on the Japanese tea ceremony, and renowned as one of medieval Japan's greatest calligraphers and sumi-e artists. Ikky\u016b wrote in Kanbun style classical Chinese, which was employed by many contemporary Japanese authors. For instance, the \"Calling My Hand Mori's Hand\" poem. ==In popular culture== In the anime OVA Read or Die, a clone of Ikky\u016b appears as the leader of the villains, all of whom are also clones of famous historical figures. In the second edition of the book On the Warrior's Path, author Daniele Bolelli refers to Ikky\u016b as his \"hero and philosophical role model\". He also explored Ikky\u016b's life story in a chapter of his 50 Things You're Not Supposed to Know: Religion, and in two episodes of the podcast History on Fire. The Japanese manga author Hisashi Sakaguchi wrote a life story of Ikky\u016b, \u3042\u3063\u304b\u3093\u3079\u30a7\u4e00\u4f11, 'Ikkyu', or 'Akkanbe Ikkyu', more or less according to the popular stories about him. The manga has been translated in four volumes into Catalan, Spanish, French, German and Italian. In the manga Afterschool Charisma, a clone of Ikky\u016b appears among the main body of classmates in a special school filled with clones of famous historical figures. Comic author Tom Robbins identifies Ikky\u016b as his \"idol\". In the anime/manga Eyeshield 21, Hosakawa Ikky\u016b (\u7d30\u5ddd\u4e00\u4f11) is the name of the genius cornerback on the Shinryuji Naga American football team. In the PSP game GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class Slapstick Wonderland, the children's story version of Ikky\u016b can be chosen as the picture book project theme/final story part of the game. Kleenex Girl Wonder wrote the song Don't Cry, Ikkyu about Ikky\u016b. In the Kamen Rider Ghost DVD special, Ikkyu Eyecon Contention! Quick Wit Battle!!, the soul of Ikky\u016b helps Takeru Tenkuji/Kamen Rider Ghost to access his monk-like Ikky\u016b Damashii form.
