    "text": "In convex analysis and the calculus of variations, branches of mathematics, a pseudoconvex function is a function that behaves like a convex function with respect to finding its local minima, but need not actually be convex. Informally, a differentiable function is pseudoconvex if it is increasing in any direction where it has a positive directional derivative. ==Formal definition== Formally, a real-valued differentiable function f defined on a (nonempty) convex open set X in the finite-dimensional Euclidean space \\mathbb{R}^nis said to be pseudoconvex if, for all x,y \\in Xsuch that abla f(x)\\cdot(y-x) \\ge 0, we have f(y)\\ge f(x). Here abla f is the gradient of f, defined by : abla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\\dots,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\right). ==Properties== Every convex function is pseudoconvex, but the converse is not true. For example, the function is pseudoconvex but not convex. Any pseudoconvex function is quasiconvex, but the converse is not true since the function is quasiconvex but not pseudoconvex. Pseudoconvexity is primarily of interest because a point x* is a local minimum of a pseudoconvex function \u0192 if and only if it is a stationary point of \u0192, which is to say that the gradient of \u0192 vanishes at x*: : abla f(x^*) = 0. ==Generalization to nondifferentiable functions== The notion of pseudoconvexity can be generalized to nondifferentiable functions as follows. Given any function we can define the upper Dini derivative of \u0192 by :f^+(x,u) = \\limsup_{h\\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x+hu) - f(x)}{h} where u is any unit vector. The function is said to be pseudoconvex if it is increasing in any direction where the upper Dini derivative is positive. More precisely, this is characterized in terms of the subdifferential \u2202\u0192 as follows: *For all , if there exists an such that \\langle x^* , y - x \\rangle \\ge 0 \\,, then for all z on the line segment adjoining x and y. ==Related notions== A ' is a function whose negative is pseudoconvex. A ' is a function that is both pseudoconvex and pseudoconcave. For example, linear\u2013fractional programs have pseudolinear objective functions and linear\u2013inequality constraints: These properties allow fractional\u2013linear problems to be solved by a variant of the simplex algorithm (of George B. Dantzig). Chapter five: Given a vector-valued function \u03b7, there is a more general notion of \u03b7-pseudoconvexity and \u03b7-pseudolinearity wherein classical pseudoconvexity and pseudolinearity pertain to the case when \u03b7(x, y) = y - x. ==See also== * Pseudoconvexity * Convex function * Quasiconvex function ==Notes== ==References== * . * . * Category:Convex analysis Category:Convex optimization Category:Types of functions Category:Generalized convexity ",
