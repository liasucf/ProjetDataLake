In addition to drums, he provides backing vocals, synthesisers, along with occasional guitar and lead vocals, for 7 Worlds Collide. Selway is well known for his precision and proficiency in various styles and unusual time signatures, being named the 26th greatest drummer of all time by Gigwise in 2008. He has worked with Samaritans since 1991. Selway has released two solo albums: Familial (2010) and Weatherhouse (2014). ==Radiohead== The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Selway, along with guitarist Ed O'Brien, was in the year above singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood, and three years above multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Selway studied Literature, Life, and Thought (English and History) at Liverpool Polytechnic's C.F. Mott Campus near Prescot (now Liverpool John Moores University). Before that, he had studied mathematics, worked for various touring musicians, and worked as an English teacher. In 1991, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They found early success with their 1992 single \"Creep\". Their third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame and is often acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.Jonathan, Emma. \"BBC Worldwide takes exclusive Radiohead performance to the world\". BBC. 3 May 2011. Retrieved 15 June 2011.

Since 2011, Selway has performed at Radiohead shows with a second drummer, Clive Deamer. Selway said: \"One played in the traditional way, the other almost mimicked a drum machine. It was push-and-pull, like kids at play, really interesting.\" == Other work == Selway performing with 7 Worlds Collide, 2009 Selway has been associated with emotional support group Samaritans as a listening volunteer since 1991. He performed with the band Dive Dive in March 2005 and appeared in the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as a member of the band \"The Weird Sisters\" along with Radiohead bandmate Jonny Greenwood and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker.

He and his wife Cait have three children: Leo, Jamie, and Patrick (to whom Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail to the Thief were dedicated, respectively). His mother Thea died during a Radiohead tour in May 2006. The band cancelled one of their dates in Amsterdam so that Selway could carry out his family duties. The band later returned to Amsterdam in August to play the missed show. The discbox, LP, and CD release of In Rainbows mentions a dedication to Thea Selway. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Charts |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| UK Peak chart positions in the United Kingdom: * For Familial: ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Folk ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Heat |- ! scope=\"row\"| Familial | * Released: 30 August 2010 (UK) * Label: Bella Union * Formats: CD, LP, download | 185 || 8 || 7 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Weatherhouse | * Released: 6 October 2014 (UK) * Label: Bella Union * Formats: CD, LP, download | \u2014 || 25 || \u2014 |} === Soundtrack albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Let Me Go | * Released: 15 September 2017 * Label: Bella Union * Formats: LP, CD, digital download |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Running Blind | * Released: 25 July 2011 * Label: Bella Union, Nonesuch * Formats: Vinyl, digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"It Will End in Tears\" |2014 | Weatherhouse |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Around Again (The Acid Remix)\" |2015 | |} ==See also== * List of Old Abingdonians ==References== ==External links== * \u2013 official site Category:1967 births Category:Art rock musicians Category:Alumni of Liverpool John Moores University Category:English rock drummers Category:People educated at Abingdon School Category:People from Abingdon-on-Thames Category:Radiohead members Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:English folk guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English electronic musicians Category:Musicians from Oxfordshire Category:Alternative rock drummers Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Living people Category:Bella Union artists Category:Teachers of English ",
