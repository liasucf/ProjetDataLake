It extends from the Karlovesk\u00e1 bay near the Lafranconi Bridge to the Port of Bratislava and Harbour Bridge. In the past, the riverfront included the Coronation Hill, where the newly crowned Kings of Hungary would recite an oath and make crosses with their sword in four cardinal directions to show their resolution to defend the country. The hill was demolished in 1870 when the shores of the Danube were strengthened. Bratislava Riverfront is a tourist attraction as well as a leisure area for the citizens of Bratislava. == Location and division == The riverfront begins near the garden of the Bratislava Water Company in the Karlova Ves borough of Bratislava and runs along the Danube up to the Harbour Bridge.

Named N\u00e1bre\u017eie \u013dubom\u00edra Kadn\u00e1ra, it consists partially of a bike path and partially of a narrow dirt road winding through the semi-preserved riparian forests. The area features the Museum of the Bratislava Water Company, the Botanical Garden of the Comenius University and the canalised outlet of the river Vydrica.
