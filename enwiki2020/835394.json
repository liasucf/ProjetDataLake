After the First and Second World Wars and Vietnam, large amounts of military surplus was left over from the large amounts of equipment made for drafted troops. However, with the advent of the military being volunteer and the fighting force being smaller, nowadays most military stores have had to switch to selling military-spec items. These mil- spec items are civilian remakes of military items - some being of military quality and some poor knockoffs. There are few \"real\" military stores left with many going out of business or moving online. Among the few authentic military stores left are Army Navy Warehouse and Army Surplus Warehouse. ===In Canada=== An ordinary army surplus store in Haikou, Hainan Province, China.

In 1948 a government agency, the Staatliche Erfassungsgesellschaft f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliches Gut (\"State Collecting Company for Public Good\", StEG), was formed to manage the sale of this army surplus. In reference to the name of this agency, the army surplus was called Stegware. The surplus included 500,000 tonnes or stock and over 150,000 tonnes of scrap. In the early 1950s the US military began to add their own surplus from the war. The joint surplus was sold in so called Steg shops across Germany until the 1980s. Goods included used and new clothing, camping equipment and tools. In the early days vehicles and heavier equipment were also sold. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Militaria Category:Retail formats ",
