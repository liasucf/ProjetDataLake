It is the national tree of Sweden. ==History== The original Orn\u00e4s birch was discovered in 1767 by Hans Gustaf Hiordt in the municipality of Orn\u00e4s, in the central Swedish province of Dalarna. Hiordt sent a description of the tree to the renowned botanist Carl Linnaeus in the Swedish university city of Uppsala. Cuttings were taken from the original tree, from which all Orn\u00e4s birch trees have been propagated. The tree fell in a storm on May 26, 1890. Two new trees were planted in its place, taken from cuttings of the original tree. At a later time a third one was added. The location of the trees is 60\u00b031'15.0\"N 15\u00b032'35.5\"E In 1985, the Orn\u00e4s birch was named as the national tree of Sweden, and examples have been planted in central locations in many Swedish towns. In that same year, the first eight Betula pendula 'dalecarlica's were imported to Pretoria, South Africa, from a nursery in Germany, by an avid tree lover, Karl Ernst Haese. ==Description== Orn\u00e4s birch trees grow to a height of 20\u201325 metres, and have a rounded, somewhat uneven crown. The main branches have an acute angle to the trunk, and only the outermost branches are hanging. The Orn\u00e4s birch is often confused with the similar birches Betula pendula 'Crispa' and Betula pendula 'Laciniata', and all three varieties are sometimes sold commercially as \"Swedish birch\". The genuine Orn\u00e4s birch can be distinguished by its growth-form, and in that its leaves are more deeply indented than the other varieties. Male and female flowers are present, and the Orn\u00e4s birch can be propagated from seed, cuttings, or grafting onto normal Betula pendula rootstock. ==See also== *Birch ==References== * eplanta.com (Swedish) * ornasbjorken.se (Swedish) * gronarader.se (Swedish) Category:National symbols of Sweden Category:Betula Category:Ornamental plant cultivars ",
