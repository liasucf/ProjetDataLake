The group emerged as a faction within National Alliance (AN), a conservative party. Its founders included Antonio Mazzochi (ex-DC), Erder Mazzocchi (ex-DC) and Pietro Armani (ex-PRI). The main goal of CR was the admission of the party into the European People's Party (EPP). In March 2009 the CR, along with the whole AN, joined The People of Freedom (PdL). In September 2008 the Christian-Social European Union, a Christian-democratic association led by Gennaro Castiello (a former member of the Christian Democratic Refoundationhttp://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/231119/consiglio-nazionale-di- rifondazione-dc-una-forte-iniziativa-democratica-e-popolare-per-uscire-dalla- crisi-) which had joined the PdL in April 2008,http://www.casertanews.it/public/articoli/200804/art_20080405083459.htm merged into the Christian Reformists, opening the way to a 40,000 members- strong \"Catholic bloc\". In 2012, while still being part of the PdL, the faction presented its own lists in a few municipalities in Central Italy, gaining a notable 10.5% in Ardea, Lazio.http://www.corriere.it/Speciali/Politica/2012/elezioni12/SEAS/amministrative/comunali/20120506000000_2_COMUNE_70_81.shtml In November 2013 the CR left the PdL and joined NCD.https://twitter.com/CristianoRiform ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:The People of Freedom factions Category:National Alliance (Italy) factions ",
