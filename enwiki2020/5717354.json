Closely modelled on the Order of Glory, it was meant to be its civilian counterpart, awarded for exceptional labour achievements. In the same way as the Order of Glory, it was divided in three classes (the highest being the 1st class), with a person initially received the third degree, and subsequently promoted to higher degrees for further achievements. It also gave a certain number of material benefits to their owners, such as pension raises or free travel in city transports. In 1991, the following number of awards were made: * 1st class \u2013 952 * 2nd class \u2013 50,000+ * 3rd class \u2013 650,000+ == Medals and ribbons == {| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" |+Ribbons ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | First Class ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Second Class ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Third Class |- | align=\"center\" | Image:Order labor glory1 rib.png | align=\"center\" | Image:Order labor glory2 rib.png | align=\"center\" | Image:Order labor glory3 rib.png |- |} == References == * Great Soviet Encyclopedia, entry on \"USSR Orders\" * Decision of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the USSR, dated 18 January 1974, compiled in Collection of legislative acts related to State Awards of the USSR\", M.
