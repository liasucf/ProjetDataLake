    "text": "The Clicking of Cuthbert is a 1924 British silent comedy series of six 30-minute short films, all involving golf. The series, directed by Andrew P. Wilson and starring Harry Beasley, was based on short stories by P. G. Wodehouse. These stories were originally published in various magazines; some of the stories had been featured in the collection The Clicking of Cuthbert (1922), while others were later included in the collection The Heart of a Goof (1926). The films were generally faithful to Wodehouse's original stories and used some of Wodehouse's language in the intertitles. However, some major new subplots and gags were added, including a mischievous caddie played by Harry Beasley. The framing device of The Oldest Member was removed, leaving Beasley as the only regular in the series. The films have been restored, and three have been made available together on video: Rodney Fails to Qualify, Chester Forgets Himself, and The Long Hole (retitled The Moving Hazard).Taves (2006), pp. 16\u201318. ==Films== All six films featured Harry Beasley, credited as The Caddie. ===The Clicking of Cuthbert=== The first short film had the same title as the series.
