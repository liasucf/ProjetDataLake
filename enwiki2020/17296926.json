    "text": "Cristian's algorithm (introduced by Flaviu Cristian in 1989) is a method for clock synchronization which can be used in many fields of distributive computer science but is primarily used in low-latency intranets. Cristian observed that this simple algorithm is probabilistic, in that it only achieves synchronization if the round-trip time (RTT) of the request is short compared to required accuracy. It also suffers in implementations using a single server, making it unsuitable for many distributive applications where redundancy may be crucial. == Description == Cristian's algorithm works between a process P, and a time server S connected to a time reference source. Put simply: # P requests the time from S # After receiving the request from P, S prepares a response and appends the time T from its own clock. # P then sets its time to be T + RTT/2 This method assumes that the RTT is split equally between request and response, which may not always be the case but is a reasonable assumption on a LAN connection. Further accuracy can be gained by making multiple requests to S and using the response with the shortest RTT. We can estimate the accuracy of the system as follows. Let min be the minimum time to transmit a message one-way. The earliest point at which S could have placed the time T, was min after P sent its request. Therefore, the time at S, when the message by P is received, is in the range (T + min) to (T + RTT - min). The width of this range is (RTT - 2*min). This gives an accuracy of (RTT/2 - min). ==See also== * Allan variance * Berkeley algorithm * Clock synchronization * Daytime protocol, older time synchronization protocol using TCP or UDP port 13 * ICMP Timestamp and ICMP Timestamp Reply, older time synchronization protocol using ICMP * International Atomic Time * NTP pool, a collection of worldwide computers that provide a highly accurate time via the Network Time Protocol * NTP server misuse and abuse * ntpd, OpenNTPD and Ntpdate * Precision Time Protocol * Synchronization * Time Protocol, older time synchronization protocol using TCP or UDP port 37 * Time server ==References== Category:Distributed algorithms Category:Synchronization ",
