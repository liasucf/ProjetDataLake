    "text": "Rutland Barrington, the original Pooh-Bah Grand Poobah is a term derived from the name of the haughty character Pooh-Bah in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (1885).This character was based, in part, on James Planch\u00e9's Baron Factotum, the \"Great-Grand-Lord-High-Everything\" from The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood (1840). Williams (2010), p. 267 In this comic opera, Pooh-Bah holds numerous exalted offices, including \"First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Chief Justice, Commander-in-Chief, Lord High Admiral ... Archbishop ... Lord Mayor\" and \"Lord High Everything Else\". The name has come to be used as a mocking title for someone self-important or locally high-ranking and who either exhibits an inflated self-regard or who has limited authority while taking impressive titles.\"Pooh-bah\", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, accessed 14 June 2009 The American writer William Safire wrote that \"everyone assumes [the name] Pooh-Bah merely comes from [W. S. Gilbert] combining the two negative exclamations Pooh! plus Bah!, typical put-downs from a typical bureaucrat.\"Safire, William. \"Whence Poo-Bah\", Safire's Political Dictionary, excerpted in GASBAG, Vol. 24, No. 3, issue 186, p. 28, January\u2013February 1993 ==In popular culture== * The term \"Grand Poobah\" was used recurringly on the television show The Flintstones as the name of a high-ranking elected position in a secret society, the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes.
