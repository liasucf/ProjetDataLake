    "text": "Where Angels Fear to Tread is the fifth studio album by the rock band Mink DeVille. It was released in 1983, and was the second album Mink DeVille recorded for Atlantic Records, and Atlantic brought in two in-house producers, Howard Albert and Ron Albert, to produce the album. Mink DeVille as a rock group had effectively ceased to exist as a band; only lead singer Willy DeVille remained from the original band. For this album, Willy DeVille reached deeper into his Latin roots, even recording a salsa number, \"Demasiado Corazon.\" A single, \u201cEach Word\u2019s a Beat of My Heart,\u201d reached number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Two percussionists from the Latin dance/disco band Foxy, Richie Puente and Joe Galdo, played on the album. A recording of \"Stand by Me\" was made at this session and released on a 7-inch single along with \u201cDemasiado Corazon\u201d and \u201cAre You Lonely Tonight?\u201d ==Reviews== Trouser Press said about the album, \u201cThis uncluttered and uncomplicated tribute to DeVille's chosen forebears -- Sam Cooke, Phil Spector, the Drifters, Joe Tex, James Brown -- also includes forays into Spanish Harlem and other wondrously nostalgic time warps. DeVille's songwriting and singing have returned to top strength, and the record burns with sincerity and warmth. Simply, elegantly excellent.\u201dEditors (2006) \u201cMink Deville/Willy Deville.\u201d Trouser Press. (Retrieved 3-30-08.) Allmusic said about Where Angels Fear to Tread, \u201cDeVille and his band were burning through the pages of rock and R&B; history (there are a couple of doo wop- and New Orleans-flavored cuts as well) with raw swagger and astonishing musicianship. Why they didn't catch on and George Thorogood did is a mystery that will be up to '80s historians to figure out.\u201dJurek, Thom (2007) [ \u201cReview: Where Angels Fear to Tread.\u201d] AllMusic. (Retrieved 3-30-08.) ==Other information== Boris Kinberg, a percussionist in The Mink DeVille Band, considered \"Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac\" one of the best songs Willy DeVille ever wrote. \"It's a brilliant song. It\u2019s a mini-film. In a three-minute song you have an hour and a half movie. It\u2019s about drug deal gone bad.\"See interviews on the Live in the Lowlands DVD (2006; Eagle Rock). Background singers Margaret Reynolds and Beverly Champion had sung with KC and the Sunshine Band and in 1985 would, under the name Margaret Reynolds and Girlfriends, record the Dubwise 12-inch single \"Three Steps from True Love.\" Willy DeVille recorded \"The Moonlight Let Me Down\" a second time in 1996 for a CD single. The single included a radio version and extended version of the song as well as \"Ballad of the Hoodlum Priest\" (from DeVille's Loup Garou). The album\u2019s title comes from the Johnny Mercer song \u201cFools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread),\u201d not from the novel by that title written by E. M. Forster. ==Track listing== Unless otherwise noted, all songs by Willy DeVille. # \u201cEach Word's a Beat of My Heart\" - 3:24 # \u201cRiver of Tears\u201d \u2013 3:18 # \u201cDemasiado Corazon (Too Much Heart)\u201d - 3:33 # \u201cLilly's Daddy's Cadillac\u201d - 2:52 # \u201cAround the Corner\u201d (Carl Sigman, Ezio Leoni, Vito Pallazicini) - 2:30 # \u201cPick Up the Pieces\u201d - 3:20 # \u201cLove's Got a Hold on Me\u201d - 4:33 # \u201cKeep Your Monkey Away from My Door\u201d - 3:08 # \u201cAre You Lonely Tonight?\u201d - 3:00 # \u201cThe Moonlight Let Me Down\u201d - 5:23 ==Personnel== *Ricky Borgia \u2013 guitar, background vocals *The C Lord C \u2013 background vocals *Beverly Champion \u2013 background vocals *Louis Cortelezzi \u2013 alto sax, baritone sax, tenor sax *Willy DeVille \u2013 vocals, guitar, background vocals *Joe Galdo \u2013 drums, percussion *Kenny Margolis \u2013 piano, organ, accordion, synthesizer *Richie Puente \u2013 percussion *Margaret Reynolds \u2013 background vocals *Joey Vasta \u2013 guitar *Fred Wickstrom \u2013 percussion, timpani ===Production=== *Ron Albert - producer, mixing *Howard Albert - producer, mixing *Jay Berman - photography *Willy DeVille - associate producer *Joseph Fontana - executive producer *Mike Fuller - mastering *Patrice Carroll Levinsohn - assistant producer *Louis Ragusa - executive producer ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Mink DeVille albums Category:Atlantic Records albums ",
