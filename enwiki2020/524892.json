    "text": "The voiceless palatal fricative is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `C`. It is the non-sibilant equivalent of the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative. The symbol \u00e7 is the letter c with a cedilla, as used to spell French and Portuguese words such as fa\u00e7ade and a\u00e7\u00e3o. However, the sound represented by the letter \u00e7 in French and Portuguese orthography is not a voiceless palatal fricative but , the voiceless alveolar fricative. Palatal fricatives are relatively rare phonemes, and only 5% of the world's languages have as a phoneme. The sound occurs, however, as an allophone of in German, or, in other languages, of in the vicinity of front vowels. There is also the voiceless post-palatal fricativeInstead of \"post-palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato-velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\". For simplicity, this article uses only the term \"post-palatal\". in some languages, which is articulated slightly more back compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical voiceless palatal fricative, though not as back as the prototypical voiceless velar fricative. The International Phonetic Alphabet does not have a separate symbol for that sound, though it can be transcribed as , (both symbols denote a retracted ) or (advanced ). The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are `C_-` and `x_+`, respectively. Especially in broad transcription, the voiceless post-palatal fricative may be transcribed as a palatalized voiceless velar fricative ( in the IPA, `x'` or `x_j` in X-SAMPA). ==Features== Features of the voiceless palatal fricative: The otherwise identical post-palatal variant is articulated slightly behind the hard palate, making it sound slightly closer to the velar . ==Occurrence== ===Palatal=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
