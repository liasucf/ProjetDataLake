    "text": "The Cambodian rebellion of 1820, also known as Neak sel Rebellion (lit. \"the holy man's rebellion\"), was a Cambodian anti-Vietnamese rebellion led by a monk named Kai. In 1819, Khmer labors were forced to reconstruct the Vietnamese V\u0129nh T\u1ebf Canal. The Khmer labors were heavily exploited by being forced to do hard work, which resulted thousands of deaths from fatigue and consequent disease during the canal's construction. Kai, a monk originally from Wat Sambaur who claimed supernatural powers, revolted against the Vietnamese. Kai occupied the Khmer holy site Ba Phnom and subsequently declared king. Most of his followers were recruited in the area around T\u00e2y Ninh.Many Buddhist monks joined his forces and killed Vietnamese. The rebels marched toward Phnom Penh, three Cambodian generals, Chaophraya Tei (or Somdet Tei, Samdech Tei), Narin Kol and Naike, joined them. King Ang Chan wanted to flee the capital, he sent a letter to Saigon to ask for help. L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t, the viceroy of Cochinchina, ordered Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Tho\u1ea1i and Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Tr\u00ed to assemble an expeditionary force. The Vietnamese army defeated the rebels, killed many of them. Kai escaped, but was pursued and killed with many monks in Kampong Cham.Kai's assistance, the novice Kuy, escaped to live among the Lao. Other leaders had to surrender, including Chaophraya Tei, Narin Kol and Naike. They were put to death in Phnom Penh and Saigon. ==Notes== ;Footnote ;Citations ==References== * * * ==See also== *Cambodian rebellion (1811\u201312) *Cambodian rebellion (1840) *Anti-Vietnamese sentiment Category:19th century in Cambodia Category:19th century in Vietnam Category:Cambodia\u2013Vietnam relations Category:Nguyen dynasty Category:Wars involving Vietnam Category:Wars involving Cambodia Category:Rebellions in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1820 Category:19th-century rebellions Category:History of Cambodia Category:National liberation movements Category:Anti-Vietnamese sentiment ",
