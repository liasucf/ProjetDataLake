Construction was commissioned by Bartolomeo Merelli, the successful impresario of the La Scala opera house in Milan. The architecture is eclectic, but mainly Gothic Revival. The layout is irregular and the facade of the main palace is at right angles to the entrance under a peaked arched balcony topped with statues. the complex includes a scenic tower.
