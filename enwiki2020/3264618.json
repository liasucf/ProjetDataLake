They protect and promote the flourishing of the specific places where they live, which can be as small as a rock or a corner of a field or as large as a section of a country. ==The nature of landv\u00e6ttir== Some scholars have suggested that landv\u00e6ttir are chthonic in nature, spirits of the dead, but others have interpreted them as nature spirits, since they sometimes live in land that has never been populated.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, vol. 1, p. 260, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1956, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, citing Dag Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck. Hilda Ellis Davidson argued that stories such as that of Goat-Bj\u00f6rn imply that they were already there when the settlers arrived in Iceland. Goat-Bj\u00f6rn was offered a partnership by a \"rock-dweller\" (bergb\u00fai) and thereafter prospered. People with second sight saw \"all the land-spirits\" following him to the thing and following his brothers hunting and fishing. They told of people worshiping and receiving advice from spirits living in waterfalls, woods, and rocks.Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson, Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions, Manchester University Press, 1988, , pp. 103-04. Goat-Bj\u00f6rn, the waterfall, and the wood she cites from Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k, the advising spirit in the rock from Kristni saga and \u00deorvalds \u00fe\u00e1ttr ens v\u00ed\u00f0f\u00f6rla. J\u00f6rmundur Ingi Hansen, former High Priest of the \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, said that landv\u00e6ttir are \"spirits and they in some way control the safety of the land, the fertility of the land, and so on.\"Jenny Blain, Wights and Ancestors: Heathenism in a Living Landscape, Devizes, Wiltshire: Wyrd's Well, 2000, , p. 7. According to him, they are \"tied to a spot in the landscape, to a huge rock, to a mountain, or to a specially beautiful place\" and that place can be recognized by being more beautiful than \"just a few yards away.\"Blain, pp. 7-8. The belief in local landv\u00e6ttir lives on in Iceland, with many farms having rocks that are not mowed closely and on which children are not allowed to play.Kveld\u00falf Hagan Gundarsson, ed., Our Troth, vol. 1: History and Lore, 2nd ed. North Charleston, SC: Booksurge, 2006, , p. 470. When construction was about to start on Keflav\u00edk air base, the Icelandic foreman dreamed that a woman came to him asking to delay moving a boulder to give her family time to move out. He did so for two weeks over American objections until she came to him in another dream telling him the landv\u00e6ttir were all out.KveldulfR Hagan Gundarsson, Elves, Wights, and Trolls, Studies Towards the Practice of Germanic Heathenry vol. 1, New York: iUniverse, 2007, , p. 18. Other terms are sometimes used in the texts for the spirits, such as bergb\u00fai, \u00e1rma\u00f0r, and sp\u00e1ma\u00f0r, but there is one mention of pre-Christian Icelanders bringing offerings specifically to landv\u00e6ttir. In a section of Hauksb\u00f3k, a Christian bishop rails against \"foolish women\" who take food out to rocks and hollows to feed the landv\u00e6ttir in hopes of being blessed with a prosperous household.\"Heimsl\u00fdsing ok Helgifr\u0153\u00f0i\" ch. 9; ed. Eir\u00edkur J\u00f3nsson, Finnur J\u00f3nsson, Copenhagen: Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab, 1896, p. 167 at Google Books (Old Norse) de Vries, p. 261.Carmina Gadelica, gathered by Alexander Carmichael (1900) ==Wealth and weal of the land== One version of the Icelandic Book of Settlement says that the ancient law of Iceland forbade having a dragon-prow in place on one's ship in harbor or coming in to land \"with gaping mouth or yawning snout\" because the landv\u00e6ttir would be frightened away.de Vries, p. 260, referring to Ulflj\u00f3t's Law, at Google Books (Old Norse) In Egils saga, Egil Skallagr\u00edmsson set up a nithing pole to agitate the landv\u00e6ttir in Norway so that they would \"go astray . . . until they have driven King Eric and Queen Gunnhild\" out of the country. Hermann P\u00e1lsson and Paul Edwards translate landv\u00e6ttir as \"guardian spirits\" in this passage.Egil's Saga, Penguin Classics, 1976, , p. 148. ===The four landv\u00e6ttir of Iceland=== Iceland is protected by four great guardians who are known as the four landv\u00e6ttir (). According to the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason in Heimskringla, King Harald Bluetooth Gormsson of Denmark, intending to invade Iceland, had a wizard send his spirit out in the form of a whale to scout it out for points of vulnerability. Swimming westwards around the northern coast, the wizard saw that all the hillsides and hollows were full of landv\u00e6ttir, \"some large and some small.\" He swam up Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, intending to go ashore, but a great dragon came flying down the valley toward him, followed by many snakes, insects, and lizards, all spitting poison at him. So he went back and continued around the coast westward to Eyjafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, where he again swam inland. This time he was met by a great bird, so big that its wings touched the hillsides on either side, with many other birds large and small following it. Retreating again and continuing west and south, he swam into Brei\u00f0afj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. There he was met by a huge bull, bellowing horribly, with many landv\u00e6ttir following it. He retreated again, continued south around Reykjanes, and tried to come ashore at Vikarsskei\u00f0, but there he encountered a mountain giant (bergrisi), his head higher than the hill-tops, with an iron staff in his hand and followed by many other giants (j\u00f6tnar). He continued along the south coast but saw nowhere else where a longship could put in, \"nothing but sands and wasteland and high waves crashing on the shore.\"tr. Lee M. Hollander, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1964, repr. 1999, , pp. 173-74; ch. 33, \"Fr\u00e1 Haraldi Gormssyni\" at Net\u00fatgafn (in Icelandic) . de Vries p. 260 refers only to the initial sight of landwights crowding the landscape; in the remainder of the passage the four guardians themselves are not called landv\u00e6ttir, and at the end they are stated to have been four named Icelanders. The four landv\u00e6ttir are now regarded as the protectors of the four quarters of Iceland: the dragon (Dreki) in the east, the eagle (Gammur) in the north, the bull (Gri\u00f0ungur) in the west, and the giant (Bergrisi) in the south. The four landv\u00e6ttir of Iceland are depicted on the Icelandic coat of arms, on the obverse of the Icelandic kr\u00f3na coins, and the team crest of Iceland's national football teams. ==See also== * Adgilis Deda, a Georgian divinity with a comparable function * Genius loci * Kami, Japanese divinities with similar properties * Landd\u00edsir, female spirits of the land attested as venerated in Iceland * Tutelary deity * V\u00e6ttir ==References== Category:Creatures in Norse mythology Category:Tutelary deities Category:Nature spirits ",
