    "text": "Pathius is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The genus was originally named Taphius by Martin Jacoby in 1897; however, this name was preoccupied by Taphius Adams, 1855 (a genus in Mollusca, currently a synonym of Biomphalaria Preston, 1910) and Taphius Rafinesque, 1815 (a nomen nudum genus in Crustacea), so it was renamed to Pathius by N. A. Aslam in 1968. ==Species== * Pathius flavus (Jacoby, 1897) * Pathius maculatus (Bryant, 1957) * Pathius major (Weise, 1912) * Pathius pallidus (Weise, 1912) * Pathius pici Zoia, 2019 * Pathius tanganikanus (Burgeon, 1941) * Pathius variabilis (Selman, 1963) * Pathius vulgaris (Chapuis, 1879) (Phascus?) ==References== Category:Eumolpinae Category:Chrysomelidae genera Category:Beetles of Africa Category:Beetles of Asia ",
