The appointment of the Chief Secretary is made directly by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The position of Chief Secretary is equivalent to the rank of Federal Secretary and the position holder usually belongs to the Pakistan Administrative Service. The current Chief Secretary Sindh is Syed Mumtaz Ali Shah, in office since September 2018. The Chief Secretary is the province's administrative boss as all administrative secretaries report to him. The CS in turn reports to the Chief Minister of Sindh, however the Chief Secretary is not under the charge of the Chief Minister as only the Prime Minister can appoint or remove the CS from his position.
