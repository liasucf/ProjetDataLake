    "text": "Bu\u0121ibba Battery (), also known as Elbene Battery (), was an artillery battery in Bu\u0121ibba, limits of St. Paul's Bay, Malta. It was built in the 18th century, by the Order of Saint John, as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands. The battery no longer exists, but its rock-hewn ditch and some foundations can still be seen. ==History== Some remains of the battery Bu\u0121ibba Battery was built in the 18th century during one of the building programmes of coastal batteries in Malta. Sources conflict as to whether it was built in 1715\u201316, or sometime between 1747 and 1784. It was one of a series of fortifications defending St. Paul's Bay, with the nearest ones to it being Wignacourt Tower and Battery to the southwest and Qawra Tower and Battery to the northeast. The battery's exact layout is not known, but it had a semi-circular gun platform with a parapet, and a blockhouse at the rear. It was surrounded by a ditch which was filled with seawater. ==Present day== Today, the battery no longer exists, but some of its rock-hewn foundations and ditch can still be seen. The ditch and the remains are listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 18th century Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:St. Paul's Bay Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications ",
