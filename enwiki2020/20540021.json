    "text": "{| |} The U-48 class was a class of four submarines or U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The design of the boats was based on plans purchased from the German firm AG Weser in January 1916. The Navy authorized Cantiere Navale Triestino to begin construction of the submarines in Pola in September 1916. Only two of the planned four boats were laid down, but neither of them was launched or completed. Both incomplete submarines were scrapped after the war ended. == Design == Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I,Gardiner, p. 341. and over the first two years of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. With boats to fill that need either under construction or purchased from Germany, efforts were focused on building submarines for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic. In January 1916 Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) purchased plans for an submarine from the German firm AG Weser of Bremen. Austro-Hungarian Navy modifications to the plans resulted in a submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged. The boats were to be long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, the design featured two shafts, with twin diesel engines of (total) for surface running at up to , and twin electric motors of (total) for submerged travel at up to . The U-48 class boats were designed for a crew of 32 men. The U-48 design called for six torpedo tubes\u2014four bow tubes and two stern tubes\u2014and carried a complement of nine torpedoes. The original design specified two 90 mm/35 (3.5 in) deck guns, which were superseded by two 120 mm/35 (4.7 in) deck guns in plans for the third and fourth boats. == Construction == In September 1916, Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) received authorization to build two boats of the class, U-48 and U-49, with the proviso that the boats be built in Budapest with final assembly at the Pola Navy Yard.Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted here (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 2 December 2008.The main CNT shipyards at Monfalcone had been overrun by the Italian Army, causing CNT to set up shop in the navy yard at Pola. These first two boats, which comprised one-third of the six submarines under construction in 1916,The other four boats were U-50 and U-51 of the and U-52 and U-53 of the . See: Gardiner, p. 341. were followed by orders for U-58 and U-59 before the war's end. Although CNT had secured fully complete plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design modifications delayed the start of construction. Additional changes after construction had begun slowed the boats' progress. Compounding this were shortages of both material and skilled shipyard workers, further slowing construction. As a result, neither of the first two boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the second pair was cancelled before either was laid down. U-48 was 70% complete at the war's end, while U-49 was only 55% complete. Both boats were scrapped in place in 1920. == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:Submarine classes Category:Submarines of the Austro-Hungarian Navy ",
