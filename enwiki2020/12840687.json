    "text": "Michael Arthur Holmes (born 9 September 1965 in Bradford) is a professional footballer who played as a midfielder in the Football League for eight teams during the 1980s and 1990s. ==Career== Holmes began his professional career when he joined Bradford City his home town team on a non-contract basis, making his league debut during the 1984\u201385 season. After only a handful of appearances at Valley Parade, he moved on to Wolverhampton Wanderers in November 1985. He made his Wolves' debut on 30 November 1985 in a 1\u20131 draw at Cardiff City. The midfielder became a regular player at Molineux, but could not halt relegation to the fourth tier. The 1986\u201387 season proved his best with the club as he played in a majority of the games, helping them to the play-offs. He scored eight times during the campaign \u2013 all coming in a nine- match hot streak. Several new signings in the close season meant Holmes' second season didn't offer as much playing time, but he still managed 30 appearances in all competitions as the club lifted the Fourth Division championship. He also played in every game in their success in the Football League Trophy. He was released in summer 1988, whereupon he joined Huddersfield Town in a short-lived move. He ended the season with an equally swift stay at Cambridge United, before signing for Rochdale. His spell there saw the club reach the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history, but after making over 60 appearances, he moved on again, signing for Torquay United, then Carlisle United and Northampton Town, but his professional career was ended at the age of 29 by a back injury sustained in a car crash. He then moved into non-league football with Wisbech Town. After spending several years in the pub trade, as a representative and running a pub-restaurant, Holmes and wife Bernadette run a sandwich shop in Leicester. He combines the role with coaching football at Leicester College, and is also co-manager, alongside former Leicester City player Matt Elliott, of Oadby Town in the Midland Alliance. ==References== ==External links== *League stats at Neil Brown's site *Wolves Heroes feature Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Blackpool Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Wisbech Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers ",
