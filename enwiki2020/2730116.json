    "text": "A Pitaval is a collection of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres. The name derived from the French advocate Fran\u00e7ois Gayot de Pitaval (1673\u20131743), who published several volumes of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres et int\u00e9ressantes between 1734 and 1743. Early works were mainly written for legal professionals but later Pitavals also became popular amongst other readers. In the 19th and early 20th century the idea of publishing criminal cases quickly spread in Europe. Pitavals became a well- known literary genre, which was often imitated.Todd Herzog: Crime Stories: Criminalistic Fantasy and the Culture of Crisis in Weimar Germany. Berghahn Books, 2009, , p. 37 Examples for Pitavals are Merkw\u00fcrdige Rechtsf\u00e4lle (1808/11) by Paul Johann Anselm von Feuerbach, Der neue Pitaval (1842\u20131890) by Julius Eduard Hitzig and Willibald Alexis, the Prager Pitaval (1931) by Egon Erwin Kisch, Der neue Pitaval (1963) by Herrmann Mostars and Robert Adolf Stemmle, Ber\u00fchmte Strafprozesse by Maximilian Jactas, Prozesse, die unsere Welt bewegten by Curt Riess and Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrt\u00fcmer by Hans M. Sutermeister (1976). Many notable authors drew their plots from Pitaval's editions. For example, E. T. A. Hoffmann's short story The Marquise de la Pivardiere (1820) is based on a real criminal case from 1697 (as described by de Pitaval).Theodore Ziolkowski. German Romanticism and Its Institutions. Princeton University Press, 1992. . P. 126-127. From 1957 to 1978 the East German TV series Fernsehpitaval depicted German true crime cases.Fernsehpitaval at imdb.com In 1982 and 1986, the Czechoslovak TV aired the series A Small Pitaval From A Large City based on true crime cases in Prague, too.A Small Pitaval From a Large City at imdb.com == External links == * Causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres et int\u00e9ressantes, avec les jugemens qui les ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9es by Fran\u00e7ois Gayot de Pitaval == References == Category:Non-fiction crime books Category:Non-fiction literature ",
