    "text": "Fernando de Toledo, (ca. 1528\u20131591) was a Spanish nobleman. He was the illegitimate and first son of Don Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, \"The Iron Duke\", who fathered Fernando de Toledo upon the daughter of a miller of La Aldehuela, in the province of \u00c1vila, Spain. Not until 1546, when Fernando was nineteen years old, did the duke recognize Fernando as his son. This later became the subject of a comedy written by the great Spanish playwright F\u00e9lix Lope de Vega y Carpio; the title of the play, \"M\u00e1s mal hay en La Aldeg\u00fcela de lo que sue\u00f1a\" means approximately, \"There are worse things in Aldehuela than you have dreamt of\". Fernando Toledo was a prior of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Castile and Le\u00f3n. He was Captain General of the cavalry of Flanders and Portugal, member of the Council of State, and (from 1571 to 1580) Viceroy of Catalonia, succeeding Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y de la Cerda (also known as Diego de Mendoza y de la Cerda, 2nd Count of M\u00e9lito, 1st Duke of Francavilla), who had been viceroy from 1564 to 1571. ==Sources== * * Category:1528 births Category:1591 deaths Category:Viceroys of Catalonia Category:Spanish untitled nobility Fernando Fernando Category:Knights Hospitaller Category:16th-century Spanish people ",
