    "text": "DreamLab is a volunteer computing mobile Android and iOS app launched in 2015 by Imperial College London and the Vodafone Foundation. == Description == The app helps to research cancer and COVID-19 and find drugs. To do this, DreamLab accesses part of the device's processing power, with the user's consent, while the owner is charging their smartphone, to speed up the calculations of the AI algorithm from the ICL (Imperial College London) research laboratory. The aim is to find existing drugs and food molecules that could help people with COVID-19 and other diseases. The performance of 100,000 smartphones would reach the annual output of all research computers at Imperial College in just three months with a nightly runtime of six hours. The app was developed in 2015 by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney and the Vodafone Foundation. As of May 2020, the project had 490,000 registered users. == External links == * DreamLab App at Google Playstore * DreamLab App at Apple Appstore * FAQ Project Dreamlab *Project Description from the Developers == References == Category:Distributed computing projects Category:Application software Category:Medical research Category:Medical research organizations Category:Protein structure Category:Bioinformatics software ",
