    "text": "Scotty's logo Scotty's Builders Supply was an American retailer of home improvement and construction products and services. The company that at its peak operated about 150 stores, closed in 2005. The company was also known as Scotty's Hardware and Scotty's Home Builders. == History == The company has its beginnings in the 1920s Florida land boom when new residents poured into the state to build houses, hotels, and other businesses. A young Georgia farmer working in Winter Haven recognized the demand for building materials and in 1924 opened \"Home Builders Supply\" in Winter Haven. Evanda Hugh Sweet, a local farmer and father of James Sweet, started with one store in 1924, and in 1925, it became incorporated; from that point it grew to a total of 162 stores. Scotty's was instrumental in helping supply building materials to the early real estate booms of Florida. Scotty's, overcome by the very competitive home improvement market, closed all the stores in 2005. Private investment company Oak Point Partners acquired the remnant assets, consisting of any known and unknown assets that weren't previously administered, from the Scott Acquisition Corp., et al., Bankruptcy Estates on September 17, 2008.Order Granting Trustee's Motion for Entry of Order Authorizing Sale of Property of the Estate to Oak Point Partners , Bankrupt Company News, September 17, 2008 == James W.
