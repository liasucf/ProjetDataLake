    "text": "Argentina has a strong body of national LGBT+ cinema. It is also home to the international LGBT film festival Libercine.https://filmfreeway.com/FestivalLibercine Some LGBT+ films from the country have been said to \"have created an impact thanks to positive critical reception, and their queer protagonists\", with the nation itself in recent years said to have \"taken the lead in Latin America in producing provocative films that shed the cliches of so much commercial gay filmmaking in the United States\". Deborah Shaw theorises that new forms of co-production and different avenues of funding may be promoting more queer film in Argentina. ==Analysis== ===Homosexuality as social commentary=== Rosalind Galt proposes that though new queer Argentine cinema and New Argentine Cinema (NAC) occupy the same time period, they may be distinct; that queer cinema is excluded from the discussion of NAC and \"crisis cinema\". Galt argues that \"queer textuality provides a radical mode of articulating economic refusal\", that the extra queer narrative is further subversive against crisis in ways not occupied by NAC, precipitated by creative and cultural differences between queer cinema and other modes of filmmaking. In his 2016 article, Guillermo Abel Severiche also positions queer Argentine cinema as \"[conceptualizing] desire as a means to defy a discourse of power\", referring to Plan B when he asserts that \"the construction of a (homo)erotic sexual tension questions the validity of sexual categories and/or their very existence\", breaking a fixed cultural construct. One way in which this is achieved is the presentation of how the protagonists discover their sexuality, without self-imposing heterosexuality onto themselves or each other. The idea of critiquing society by empowering characters through queer narratives had been mentioned by Luc\u00eda Brackes of Los Andes in 2012, in discussion of the much older 1969 Fuego. Brackes reflects that \"Coca is such a whore that she becomes a lesbian, a revolutionary and almost militant idea about the oppressed condition of women.\" ===\"Berger shot\"=== The \"Berger shot\" drives the view to men's crotches Severiche also writes that director Marco Berger uses cinematographic techniques that result in \"a (homo)erotization of the cinematographic image that intends to break the consolidation of heteronormative conceptions of sexuality\"; these techniques include what he refers to as the \"Berger shot\" \u2014 \"shots that depict a young man's crotch\". He notes that the \"Berger shot\" is an example and an anti- example of the Male Gaze, and can be included in the \"queer gaze\". Mark James writes that \"Berger's distinctive style [is] both tensely sexual but also sensual and romantic\" in how the camera is often \"lingering on the parts of gay imagination and sensuality that all gay boys grow up trying to process \u2014 the sight of a man's arms, hands, legs, hair\u2026 handsome faces and the male body\"; the sexuality but also the innocence means that though imagery of the body is not uncommon in film, \"Berger works it at a wholly different level\", as he intentionally avoids using stereotypical gay imagery in his shots. The Fujoshi film reviewers look at the 2016 film Taekwondo, which Berger co- directed, identifying how even though it is set in a downtown hotel without homoerotic fighting scenes it shows male physicality with \"a lot of physical contact and the bodies (and private parts) detail shots\" (sic); the \"extraordinary masculinity\" is still captured despite its slow and emotional tone. ==Films== Though not produced in Argentina, Wong Kar-wai's famous Happy Together is largely set in the country.https://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-50-best-gay-movies-the-best- in-lgbt-film-making The Argentine films La Le\u00f3n (2007), Absent (2011) and Brief Story from the Green Planet (2019) won the Teddy for best LGBTQ+ feature at the Berlin Film Festival. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Film title !Director !Notes |- |1969 |Fuego |Armando B\u00f3 | |- |1975 |Mi novia el... |Enrique Cahen Salaberry |based on Victor and Victoria |- |1984 |Atrapadas |An\u00edbal Di Salvo | |- |2000 |Apariencias |Alberto Lecchi | |- |2001 |Burnt Money |Marcelo Pi\u00f1eyro |based on a true story |- |2001 |La Ci\u00e9naga |Lucrecia Martel |Salta trilogy |- |2002 |Tan de repente |Diego Lerman | |- |2003 |Carandiru |H\u00e9ctor Babenco |based on Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Carandiru |- |2004 |The Holy Girl |Lucrecia Martel |Salta trilogy |- |2005 |A Year Without Love |Anah\u00ed Berneri | |- |2006 |Glue |Alexis Dos Santos |starring In\u00e9s Efron |- |2007 |La Le\u00f3n |Santiago Otheguy | |- |2007 |XXY |Luc\u00eda Puenzo |starring In\u00e9s Efron and Ail\u00edn Salas |- |2008 |The Headless Woman |Lucrecia Martel |Salta trilogy; starring In\u00e9s Efron |- |2009 |The Fish Child |Luc\u00eda Puenzo |starring In\u00e9s Efron and Ail\u00edn Salas |- |2009 |The Last Summer of La Boyita |Julia Solomonoff | |- |2009 |Plan B |Marco Berger | |- |2011 |Absent (Ausente) |Marco Berger |starring Javier De Pietro |- |2011 |Olympia |Leo Damario | |- |2011 |Widows |Marcos Carnevale | |- |2012 |My Last Round |Julio Jorquera | |- |2013 |Hawaii |Marco Berger | |- |2014 |Death in Buenos Aires |Natalia Meta | |- |2014 |The Guest (La Visita) |Mauricio L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez | |- |2015 |Butterfly |Marco Berger |starring Ail\u00edn Salas, Javier De Pietro |- |2015 |Rara |Pepa San Mart\u00edn | |- |2016 |Esteros |Papu Curotto | |- |2016 |Taekwondo |Marco Berger | |- |2017 |The Heavy Hand of the Law |Fern\u00e1n Mir\u00e1s | |- |2018 |El \u00c1ngel |Luis Ortega |based on a true story |- |2018 |Las hijas del fuego |Albertina Carri | |- |2018 |Marilyn |Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Redondo |based on a true story |- |2018 |My Best Friend |Mart\u00edn Deus | |- |2019 |Un Rubio (The Blonde One) |Marco Berger | |- |2019 |Brief Story from the Green Planet (Breve historia del planeta verde) |Santiago Loza | |- |2019 |End of the Century (Fin de siglo) |Lucio Castro | |- |2020 |El cazador (The Young Hunter) |Marco Berger | |} ==References== Cinema ",
