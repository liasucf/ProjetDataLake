    "text": "Walter Moses Burton (August 9, 1840 - June 4, 1913) was a prosperous farmer and Republican politician who served four terms in the Texas State Senate. Born into slavery in North Carolina in 1840, he was brought to Texas about 1860 (some sources say 1850). His owner, Thomas Burke Burton, a plantation owner in Fort Bend County, taught him to read and write. After emancipation, he purchased several tracts of land from his former owner. He became active in Republican party politics and was elected as the sheriff and tax collector in Fort Bend County in 1869. He was the first Black elected sheriff in the United States. He was first elected to the Fourteenth Legislature in 1874 and served almost continually until 1883. After leaving office, he returned to farming, but continued to be active in the Republican party until his death in 1913. He is buried in the Morton Cemetery in Richmond, Texas. ==References== :Texas Legislators: Past & Present - Walter Burton :Handbook of Texas Online - Walter Moses Burton :Forever Free: Nineteenth Century African-American Legislators and Constitutional Convention Delegates of Texas :Findagrave - Walter Moses Burton : Category:Texas state senators Category:Texas Republicans Category:1840 births Category:1913 deaths Category:American freedmen Category:19th-century American politicians Category:African-American politicians during the Reconstruction Era Category:African-American state legislators in Texas ",
