In 1927 he was transferred to Canada's Department of Railways and Canals, and was appointed the supervising engineer in charge of building the Port facilities and rail terminal, in Churchill, Manitoba. Kydd supervised a construction force of over 1,500 workers. When the port was opened for operations, in 1933, Kydd remained supervising engineer, and was appointed the port's first harbourmaster. Decades later a tugboat operating in Churchill was named in honour of him. ==References== Kydd, George ",
