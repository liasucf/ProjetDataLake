It stretches from Dijon in the north to the river Dheune to the south, overlooking the valley of the Sa\u00f4ne to the east. The east-facing slope of the C\u00f4te d'Or is home to some of the greatest names of Burgundy wine, such as Gevrey-Chambertin, Clos de Vougeot, Meursault and Montrachet. The northern half, the C\u00f4te de Nuits, produces red wine almost exclusively. The C\u00f4te de Beaune, around Beaune in the south, produces a mix of white wine and red wine. The Route des Grands Crus (Route Nationale 74) runs along the foot of the ridge and is popular with tourists. Scientists have not yet conclusively determined what factors cause the few small parcels of land on the C\u00f4te d'Or to produce superlative wines.Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson, The World Atlas of Wine 7th ed. Octopus Publishing Group, 2013 p.50 ==History== The area was settled by the Celts, and there is considerable evidence of Roman occupation in the area. Later it came under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy, with the Cistercians from C\u00eeteaux Abbey playing a prominent role in the development of the vineyards. ==Geology== If the Paris hydrological and geological basin is viewed as a saucer with Paris at its centre, the C\u00f4te d'Or may be seen as a segment of its south-eastern rim; the counterpart of the chalk cliffs of the Pays de Caux, on the English Channel coast to the north-west. The River Seine rises near the C\u00f4te d'Or and enters the sea near the Pays de Caux, having passed through Paris. The C\u00f4te d'Or scarp arises where a broad, relatively shallow graben has formed as a result of an interaction between the forces raising the alpine ridges and the Massif Central. The Jurassic limestone contributes the chemically basic component of the mixture of requirements for a good vineyard, while the scarp provides the drainage and aspect. At the C\u00f4te d'Or, the middle and upper Jurassic rocks overlook the Oligocene, Pliocene and Quaternary rocks of the plain through which the Sa\u00f4ne flows southward towards the Mediterranean Sea. The c\u00f4te therefore forms part of the watershed between northern and southern Europe. On the far side of the plain rise the Jura Mountains, for which the Jurassic period was named. The Route des Grands Crus ==Comblanchien stone== Near Nuits-Saint-Georges, part of the middle Jurassic limestone has been metamorphosed into marble. The metamorphism seems to have arisen from the volcanic disturbances in the already existing (Variscan) Massif Central, set off by the Alpine orogeny. The Massif Central is represented locally by its northern extension, the Morvan, which lies between Nevers and the C\u00f4te d'Or. There is a famous vein of fine-grained marble called Pierre de Comblanchien extending from the village of Comblanchien, just south of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The quarries lie in the C\u00f4te north and south of the village, overlooking Route Nationale 74. The stone comes in a variety of shades, from beige to the pink of bindweed (Convolvulus). It is not susceptible to frost damage and is capable of accepting a polish. ==See also== *Burgundy wine *French wine ==References== ==Further reading== * A bit out of date, and doesn't cover all of Burgundy, but is still the definitive guide.
