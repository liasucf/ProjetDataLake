They were the first refugee group to be taken by the government. In 18 November 1973, it was reported that the first refugees were leaving Santiago and headed to Helsinki. This was handled by Finnish Red Cross. The head manager Gunnar Ros\u00e9n made sure that the refugees were taken care of until everyone had a job and an apartment. They were also promised necessary education. The first group arrived the next day in 19 November 1973. There were about 30 refugees, among them other Latin Americans.https://www.ess.fi/uutiset/paijathame/2007/02/05/pakolaisena- suomessahttps://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2019/04/26/chilen-pakolaiset-saivat- suomessa-lampiman-vastaanoton-ja-voimistivat The Finns welcomed Chileans.
