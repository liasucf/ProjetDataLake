Food Administration was the agency responsible for the administration of the U.S. army overseas and allies' food reserves during the United States participation in World War I. One of its important tasks was the stabilization of the price of wheat on the U.S. market. It was established by of August 10, 1917, pursuant to the Food and Fuel Control Act, and was abolished by another executive order, , on August 21, 1920. \"Records of the United States Food Administration\", The National Archives at Fort Worth, Texas During the time of the administration, the United States was short of nearly everything as many commodities were being sold to their allies. All citizens were asked to donate any weapons, horses, and ammunition they possessed to help supply the army, with a small hope of the items being returned. The rationing was done during this time of National need so that food for soldiers, and citizens, wouldn't be an issue. Concepts such as \"meatless Mondays\" and \"wheatless Wednesdays\" were also implemented to help ration food, so that the government could prioritise the war effort. ==History== Mina Van Winkle, in Food Administration uniform, explains Victory gardening and explains recommended food processing. ===The appointment of Hoover=== Woodrow Wilson realised he would need a dynamic leader to ensure the Food administration was effective. His advisor, Edward House suggested Herbert Hoover who had previously run the Commission for Relief in Belgium. Walter Hines Page, the British ambassador, endorsed this choice and Wilson, a Democrat agreed although Hoover was a Republican. Hoover accepted the position only on the basis that he would have a completely free hand as regards the Washington bureaucracy, which in particular referred to David F. Houston, the Secretary of Agriculture. Despite initial resistance Houston acquiesced and Hoover was appointed. ===Grain Corporation=== The administration employed its Grain Corporation, organized under the provisions of the Food Control Act of August 10, 1917, as an agency for the purchase and sale of foodstuff. Having done transactions in the size of $7 billion it was rendered obsolete by the armistice in Europe. President Woodrow Wilson promoted its transition in a new agency for the support of the reconstruction of Europe. It became the American Relief Administration, approved by an Act (Public, No. 274, 65th Congress) on February 25, 1919. The Food Administration Grain Corporation became the United States Grain Corporation pursuant to of May 14, 1919. ==Poster advertising issued== File:Clean Plate Club pic..png File:\"Sugar means Ships...Every Spoonful -Every Sip- Means less for a Fighter.\", ca. 1918 - ca. 1918.tif File:\"Member of the United States Food Administration.
