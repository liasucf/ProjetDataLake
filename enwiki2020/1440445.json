    "text": "Zdravko Stoyanov Zdravkov (; born 4 October 1970 in Sofia) is a former Bulgarian football goalkeeper. He ended his career at the end of 2006\u201307 season. ==Club career== On the club level, Zdravkov has played for Levski Sofia (1989\u20131995), Istanbulspor (1997\u20131999 and 2000\u20132002), Adanaspor (1999\u20132000), Cherno More (2002\u20132003), Litex Lovech (2003\u20132004) and \u00c7aykur Rizespor (2004\u20132007). December 2002 until January 2003, Zdravkov spent a trial period with Arsenal F.C., but did not eventually sign with the then-reigning FA Premier League champions. ==International career== For Bulgaria, Zdravkov has been capped 70 times. He made his debut on 24 April 1996, against Slovakia in Trnava. He was the starting goalkeeper for his country at the Euro 1996, 1998 World Cup and Euro 2004. Halfway through the France World Cup in 1998, with Bulgaria having played two games (0\u20130 against Paraguay and a 0\u20131 loss to Nigeria), Zdravkov was ranked as the 2nd best goalkeeper in form. Although he went on to concede 6 goals in Bulgaria's loss to Spain in the next game, Zdravkov was an exceptional performer at the World Cup. Six years later, at UEFA Euro 2004, Zdravkov's age began to show, as he was completely outclassed by Swedish, Danish and Italian attackers. Bulgaria lost 0\u20135 to Sweden, 0\u20132 to Denmark and 1\u20132 to Italy, and this was to be Zdravkov's final tournament as national team goalkeeper. ==Personal== Zdravkov participated in the third season of Survivor BG, in Panama, but was evacuated due to serious health problems. He is married to Irena and they have three sons - Ivan, Yoan and Pavel. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Levski Sofia * A Group (2): 1992\u201393, 1994\u201395 * Bulgarian Cup (2): 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392 ;Slavia Sofia * A Group: 1995\u201396 * Bulgarian Cup: 1995\u201396 ;Litex Lovech * Bulgarian Cup: 2003\u201304 ==References== == External links == * Profile at LevskiSofia.info * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Bulgarian footballers Category:Bulgaria international footballers Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:\u00c7aykur Rizespor footballers Category:\u0130stanbulspor footballers Category:Adanaspor footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Bulgarian expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:PFC Levski Sofia players Category:PFC Litex Lovech players Category:PFC Slavia Sofia players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players Category:PFC Cherno More Varna players Category:Bulgarian expatriate footballers Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:Expatriate football managers in China Category:Bulgarian football managers ",
