    "text": "\"Moja \u0161tikla\" (English translation: \"My High-Heel\") was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed in Croatian by Severina. Despite Croatia's previous entry, \"Vukovi umiru sami\" having finished eleventh, Croatia was the beneficiary of the controversy surrounding the national final of Serbia and Montenegro, in which No Name was forced to withdraw from the Contest. Thus, there was a vacant space in the final, which went to Croatia who had finished just outside the top ten. The song was performed twentieth on the night, following France's Virginie Pouchain with \"Il \u00e9tait temps\" and preceding Ireland's Brian Kennedy with \"Every Song Is a Cry for Love\". At the close of voting, it had received 56 points, placing equal 12 in a field of 24 and returning Croatia to the semi-final for their next Contest appearance. The song itself was described in commentary as being in the turbo-folk style, with Severina singing about various chat-up attempts from local men, as well as entering into folk-influenced call-and-response lyrics with her backing singers. The performance featured the combination of traditionally-dressed Balkan folk musicians and Severina herself in a red dress. The dress was partly removed (in a move made famous by Bucks Fizz in their performance of \"Making Your Mind Up\" and now almost de rigueur in the Contest) during the performance. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2007 Contest by Dragonfly featuring Dado Topi\u0107 with \"Vjerujem u ljubav\". The song was on Severina's 2006 extended play, Moja \u0161tikla / Moj sokole. Its controversy and performance inspired a wide range of parodies, the most notable one being \"U govno je stala moja \u0161tikla (Turbo folk \u0161tikla)\" produced by Croatian comic artist Stevo Sinik. The video in question mocks the song, drawing the parallel that it has many elements of turbo folk, which doesn't represent the country. The parody's satirical lyrics and rustic style have contributed to the popularity of the song, and it became one of the most popular parodies in Croatia in 2006. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2006) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Croatian Top 20 ChartCroatian Top 20 Chart |align=\"center\"|6 |- |} ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of 2006 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:2006 songs ",
