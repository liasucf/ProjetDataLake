The Most Typical Avant-Garde: History and Geography of Minor Cinemas in Los Angeles. University of California Press, 2005. p. 355. == Background == Bromberg originally studied journalism and photography at Northwestern University before she became a filmmaker. Bromberg started making her first films at Sarah Lawrence College in 1977, where she studied both film and electronic music. After she graduated from college, Betzy Bromberg relocated to Los Angeles and studied at CalArts under Chick Strand. Later, she spent over twenty years working in the Hollywood industry as an optical effects camerawoman and supervisor. She began teaching in 1990 and in 2002, she became the Director of the Program in Film and Video at CalArts after the industry abandoned analog effects and moved much production overseas. == Style == Bromberg\u2019s earlier films were influenced by New York, where she spent was born and raised, and spent part of her college career. She is known for her experimental avant-garde stylistic approach in cinema. In many of her works she experiments with the intersection of documentary and avant-garde. Bromberg's work in the Hollywood industry of optical effects allowed her to carry over technical and problem solving skills to her experimental work without detriment to its avant-garde themes. Additionally, her experimental film works have all been shot in 16mm, an analog medium which Bromberg says she will work with until \"either I'm done or it's done,\" in reference to the dominance of digital filmmaking in Hollywood. The style of Bromberg's experimental films is described as slowly evolving into the abstract, consciously free of the special effects of her industry career, and evocative of \"a retrieval of a kind of visual innocence.\" Bromberg's use of light and the transformation of the movement of light over time is the basis of her filmmaking and can be seen throughout her works. ==Directorial filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Film Name !Details |- |Glide of Transparency |2016, 16mm, color, sound, 89 minutes, a film in three parts.
