Mature animation is comparatively rare in North America, as animated series are culturally expected to be created for children. This list does not include European, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean series, as mature animation is much more common in these regions. ==Pre-1990s== ===United States=== {| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Genre ! scope=\"col\" | Seasons/episodes ! scope=\"col\" | Show creator(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Original release ! scope=\"col\" | Network ! scope=\"col\" | Studio ! scope=\"col\" | Age rating ! scope=\"col\" | Status |- | Where's Huddles? | Sitcom | 1 season, 10 episodes | \u2022 William Hanna \u2022 Joseph Barbera | July 1, 1970 \u2013 September 2, 1970 | CBS | Hanna-Barbera | TV-G | Ended |- | Wait Till Your Father Gets Home | Sitcom | 3 seasons, 48 episodes | \u2022 William Hanna \u2022 Joseph Barbera | September 12, 1972 \u2013 October 8, 1974 | Syndication | Hanna- Barbera | TV-Y7 | Ended |- | Jokebook | Animated comedy | 1 season, 3 episodes | \u00b7 William Hanna \u00b7Joseph Barbera | April 23, 1982 - May 7, 1982 | NBC | Hanna-Barbera | TV-NR | Ended |- | Stevie and Zoya | Action | 1 season, 13 episodes | Joe Horne | 1987 \u2013 1989 | MTV | MTV Animation | TV-14 | Ended |- | The Simpsons | Sitcom | 32 seasons, 686 episodes | Matt Groening | December 17, 1989 \u2013 present | Fox | \u2022 Gracie Films \u2022 20th Television | \u2022 TV-PG \u2022 TV-14 (some episodes) | Pending |- |} ===United Kingdom=== {| style=\"text- align:center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Genre ! scope=\"col\" | Seasons/episodes ! scope=\"col\" | Show creator(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Original release ! scope=\"col\" | Network ! scope=\"col\" | Studio ! scope= \"col\" | Status |- | Dick Spanner, P.I. | Comedy | 1 season, 22 episodes | Terry Adlam | 1986 \u2013 1987 | Channel 4 | Virgin Group | Ended |} ==1990s== ===United States=== {| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Genre ! scope=\"col\" | Seasons/episodes ! scope=\"col\" | Show creator(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Original release ! scope=\"col\" | Network ! scope=\"col\" | Studio ! scope=\"col\" | Age rating ! scope= \"col\" | Status |- | \u00c6on Flux | \u2022 Avant-garde \u2022 Science fiction | 3 seasons, 16 episodes | Peter Chung | November 30, 1991 \u2013 October 10, 1995 | MTV | MTV Animation | TV-MA | Ended |- | Liquid Television | Animation showcase | 3 seasons, 27 episodes | Japhet Asher | November 30, 1991 \u2013 January 1, 1995 | MTV | \u2022 MTV Animation \u2022 BBC Enterprises \u2022 Colossal Pictures \u2022 BIG Pictures \u2022 Noyes & Laybourne Enterprises | TV-14 | Ended |- | Fish Police | \u2022 Crime \u2022 Comedy | 1 season, 6 episodes | based on the comic created by Steve Moncuse | February 28, 1992 \u2013 March 13, 1992 | CBS | Hanna-Barbera | TV-PG | Ended |- | Beavis and Butt-Head | Sitcom | 8 seasons, 222 episodes | Mike Judge | \u2022 Original series: March 8, 1993 \u2013 November 28, 1997 \u2022 Revival series: October 27 \u2013 December 29, 2011 \u2022 2nd Revival series: Release Date TBA | MTV \u2022 Comedy Central | \u2022 J.J.
