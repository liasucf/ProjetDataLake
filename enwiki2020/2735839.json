The station's frequency was 106.5, which it shared with the University of Minnesota's KUOM-FM in a timesharing agreement.\"Annual Notification of Sharetime Schedule\" (radiok.org) The station was owned by Independent School District #283. ==History== The station began in 1973 with a low-power signal that could only reach a portion of St. Louis Park High School; during this period, the station used the call signs WHAT, WSLP, and KTS. In 1977, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the school district a license to operate a 10-watt radio station, which took the call sign KDXL. KDXL operated at 91.7 through 1985; it changed frequencies so that it would not have a frequency close to KQRS-FM. Independent School District #283 voted to shut down KDXL on June 25, 2018; the following day, it informed the FCC that the station would cease operations on July 1. The license was cancelled on July 16, 2018. ==References== ==External links== Category:Radio stations in Minnesota Category:Radio stations established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Minnesota Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2018 Category:2018 disestablishments in Minnesota Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Defunct mass media in Minnesota ",
