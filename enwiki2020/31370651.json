    "text": "The College of the Marists () is a former-college in the civil parish of Lordelo do Ouro e Massarelos, in the municipality of Porto, in the Portuguese district of the same name. ==History== Although its date of construction is unclear, there was a petition to the local government on 9 April 1895, by the builder Jo\u00e3o Gomes da Silva Guerra. The councilman Boaventura Rodrigues de Sousa, proprietary owner of the land on Avenida da Boavista (referred to on 9 April) and may have been the reason for the monogram inscribed on the cornices. The building and landscaping was attributed to Joel Pereira, owing to Boaventura Rodrigues de Sousa having many similar requirements for other buildings along the Pra\u00e7a Gomes Teixeira, including an example on the corner of Rua das Carmelitas of the same authorship whose used a monogram also inscribed with the owners acronyms. From an inventory elaborated by the Reparti\u00e7\u00e3o de Arboriza\u00e7\u00e3o e Jardinagem (Landscaping and Gardening division) of Porto the site was populated with Cam\u00e9lias jap\u00f3nicas (34), Palmeiras spp. (10), Rododendron (4), Liriodendron tulip\u00edfera (2), T\u00edlias cordatas (2), T\u00edlias argentea (6), T\u00edlias tomentosas (2), Sequ\u00f3ia and Pitosporum. The paintings on the walls in the Music Salon were executed in 1899 by A. Mello. Construction of the wall oriented towards the Avenida da Boavista occurred in 1900. Between 1910 and 1926, the residence was unoccupied as the owners, Adelaide Chambers de Sousa moved her residence to another building along Avenida da Boavista. Beginning between 1926 and 1958, it began to be used a college, specifically the Col\u00e9gio de Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio (College of Our Lady of the Rosary), but still under the ownership of Adelaide Chambers. Between 1959 and 1991, it was the seat and school of the Col\u00e9gio dos Maristas (College of the Marist Brothers). Owing to its several years of service and architecture, a plan to classify the building began on 22 January 1982. A dispatch was issued on 13 March by the Secret\u00e1rio de Estado da Cultura (Secretary-of-State for Culture), yet the former residence remained unoccupied between 1991 and 1995. In 1995, the property changed ownership and began to be the title of BOAPOR, who seat was on Rua do Virg\u00edlio Correia, 49A in Lisbon. A new process was open on 9 May 1996, by the Vice-President of IPPAR, but little advanced until 19 September 2000 (when a dispatch was ordered to reconfigure the area of intervention), this after a proposal was issued on 21 August 2000, by the DRPorto to alter the classification area. A project to rehabilitate the building, under the direction of architects Ant\u00f3nio Portugal Mendon\u00e7a and Manuel Amorim Reis, received the Jo\u00e3o de Almeida Prize in 2006, from the municipality of Porto. On 20 March 2012, the DRCNorte proposed classifying the structure as a Monumento of Interesse P\u00fablico, which received support and was designated on 14 November 2012, along with the establishment of ZPE (Special Protection Area) designation (Announcement 13694/2012, Di\u00e1rio da Republica, S\u00e9rie 2, 220). ==Architecture== The main staircase of to the college The former-college is located in an urban context, addorssing the Avenida da Boavista (to the south) and the Rua de Pedro Hispanoto the north). to the east of the avenue are other palacettes, among them the former-residence of the Viscountess of Lob\u00f5o (already classified). To the west are larger buildings, most modern, including the Hotel Meridien. The building is sited on an elevated plateau relative the Avenida da Boavista taking the form of a trapezoid, with the rear of the building limited by high, granite wall supporting the terrain. In the front, along Avenida da Boavista is a similar granite wall, but of smaller dimensions, surmounted by iron grate. The rectangular building with basement, is two-storeys with mansard roof. A simple plan, the principal facade (oriented to the Avenida da Boavista) includes porch fronted by staircase and defined by balustrade in granite.

On its rear profile, the building is marked by a slender and aligned aperture, while the side elevations (equal to one another) features a ground floor with four windows and an upper floor with balcony doors. The surfaces have a continuous cornice in granite with closed and areas with vases, interrupted the main facade in the center by a small backrest surmounted by a perfect arch back inscribed with the monogram BRS.
