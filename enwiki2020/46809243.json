She runs trying to escape the forest and sees a man in a bath tub full of grub worms and sees a tree with the word \"RUN\" both capitalized and in blood. The female also gets chased by somebody who appears to be a ghost. In the end, she wakes up believing it was just a dream but her feet are covered in mud and there are worms all over and around her clock.
