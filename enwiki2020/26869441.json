They are currently competing in the Basketball League of Serbia. The club is a founding member and shareholder of the Adriatic Basketball Association. ==History== Metalac was established on 24 March 1948 as KK Budu\u0107nost Valjevo. Six days later, the club played its first official game in \u010ca\u010dak against Borac and lost 69:19. In a relatively short period of time, they managed to qualify for a higher level of competition, entering the South Group of a then minor Serbian League under the new name Metalac in 1954. Due to financial problems in 1960, the club had to leave all competitions and restart from scratch again a year after. In 1973 Metalac managed to qualify for the First Yugoslav Federal League by beating Mladost Zemun in the last round of the competition, gaining a decisive advantage over Vojvodina Novi Sad. Metalac spent six consecutive seasons in the First League and managed to beat at least once all the big clubs of Yugoslav basketball in that period. They played their last game in Yugoslav First Federal League on 31 March 1979 against Jugoplastika in Split. During the last couple of years, professional basketball in Valjevo is on the rise again. Metalac qualified for the top level of club competition in Serbia in 2007\u201308 and since then managed to progress to the Basketball League of Serbia Superleague phase five times. They have constantly been a serious contender for a spot in the Adriatic League over the past few seasons and finally became part of it in 2014\u201315 after Radni\u010dki Kragujevac opted out because of financial instability. ==Sponsorship naming== The club has had several denominations through the years due to its sponsorship: * Metalac Family One (1992\u20131993) * Big Enex Metalac (1993\u20131995) * Metalac Farmakom (2013\u20132016) ==Players== ===Current roster=== ==Head coaches== * \u010cedomir Vidakovi\u0107 (1954\u20131955) * Luka Stan\u010di\u0107 (1960\u20131974) * Dragoljub Pljaki\u0107 (1976\u20131977) * Luka Stan\u010di\u0107 (1980\u20131985) * Zoran Kova\u010devi\u0107 (1985\u20131987) * Luka Stan\u010di\u0107 (1987\u20131988) * Luka Stan\u010di\u0107 (1989\u20131990) * Mihailo Po\u010dek (1990\u20131992) * Dragomir Nikitovi\u0107 (1992) * Zoran Kova\u010devi\u0107 (1992\u20131993) * Vojislav Kecojevi\u0107 (1993\u20131995) * Dragan Simeunovi\u0107 (2005\u20132008) * Vlade \u0110urovi\u0107 (2008\u20132009) * Aleksandar Ici\u0107 (2009) * Milovan Stepandi\u0107 (2009\u20132010) * Velimir Ga\u0161i\u0107 (2010) * Milovan Stepandi\u0107 (2010\u20132011) * Bo\u0161ko \u0110oki\u0107 (2011\u20132012) * Dragan Nikoli\u0107 (2012\u20132013) * Milovan Stepandi\u0107 (2013) * Sini\u0161a Mati\u0107 (2013\u20132014) * Vladimir \u0110oki\u0107 (2014\u20132016) * Mihailo Po\u010dek (2016\u20132019) * Vladimir \u0110oki\u0107 (2019\u2013present) ==Notable players== * Stefan Bir\u010devi\u0107 * Petar Bo\u017ei\u0107 * Vuka\u0161in Aleksi\u0107 * Zlatko Boli\u0107 * Du\u0161ko Buni\u0107 * Marko \u010cakarevi\u0107 * Vladimir \u0110oki\u0107 * Mile Ili\u0107 * Marko Ljubi\u010di\u0107 * Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 * Petar Popovi\u0107 * Stefan Sinovec * Kimani Ffriend * Marko Dujkovi\u0107 * Bojan Baki\u0107 * Vladimir Da\u0161i\u0107 * Ivan Mara\u0161 * Slavko Vrane\u0161 * Reggie Freeman * Ashton Mitchell * Renaldo Woolridge ==References== ==External links== * Metalac Valjevo Category:Sport in Valjevo Category:Basketball teams in Yugoslavia Category:Basketball teams established in 1948 ",
