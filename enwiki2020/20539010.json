He had also been the Prime Minister of Agha Mir. Mirza Ghalib received an invitation to a reception in audience by the ruler's Deputy Prime Minister i.e. Subhan Ali Kamboh but the meeting did not happen because Mirza Ghalib stipulated two pre-conditions to his meeting with the formers: (1), that he be granted 'due honor' and (2), that he should be 'excused from making the customary peshkash '. Benefactors did not like pre-conditions being laid down by the supplicants hence the meeting failed.British Aggression in Avadh,1969, p 14, Safi Ahmad Khan, M. M.
