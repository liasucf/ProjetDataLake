    "text": "The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Arantzazu is a Franciscan sanctuary located in O\u00f1ati, Basque Country, Spain. The shrine is a much appreciated place among Gipuzkoans, with the Virgin of Arantzazu being the sanctuary's namesake and patron saint of the province along with Ignatius of Loyola. The place benefits from the highland silence and peaceful atmosphere of the Aizkorri mountain range along with a good road infrastructure, so the place is frequently visited by devotees and regional and foreign tourists alike. It is located in the site where presumably the Virgin of Arantzazu appeared to the shepherd Rodrigo de Balanzategui in 1468. Legend has it, the figure of the Virgin was in a thorn-bush, and his exclamation \"Arantzan zu?!\" (Thou, among the thorns?!) gave rise to the name of the place. According to the linguistic explanation, the name stems from \"arantza + zu\", 'place abounding in hawthorn'. Arantzazu can be found as a female name in Spain in the forms of Arantza and Arantzazu (especially in Biscay and Gipuzkoa) along with Arancha (Spanish spelling) or Arantxa (Basque spelling), much in line with Spanish phonetics. The place is also a starting point for several mountains trails and circuits for hikers that provide access to the meadows of Urbia and on to the mountain range Aizkorri, to the massif Alo\u00f1a and to the lands south and east of the shrine. All the trails are well signalled. Pope Leo XIII granted a Canonical coronation to the image on 13 September 1885. A variant replica bearing its same title was brought to the Philippines in 1705,featuring a standing posture. Pope Francis granted a Canonical coronation to the Philippine image on 31 May 2017.The image is currently enshrined in the Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Our Lady of Arantzazu in San Mateo, Rizal == Etymology == View of the Sanctuary of Arantzazu The name of the sanctuary, the place, and the Virgin are all related to the legend of her appearance. The word arantzazu itself is made up of \"arantza\" which means \"thorn\"1 iz. thorn; spine; prickle 2 iz. (hed.) pain; suffering and the suffix \"zu\" indicating \"abundance\",-zu: atz sufijo abundancial. Bimila hiztegia. Editorial: Elkar S. A. San Sebasti\u00e1n 1991. making the translation \"abundance of thorns\", making reference to the abundant thorny bushes that grow in the area. Esteban de Garibay, in his Compendio historial de las Chr\u00f3nicas y universal historia de todos los Reynos d'Espa\u00f1a (1571),Fundaci\u00f3n San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla. Esteban de Garibay states that the Virgin appeared to a young girl named Mar\u00eda de Datuxtegui. In the same book, however, he gives another version, which is better known. Garibay says that he heard this story from the mouth of a witness who knew a shepherd named Rodrigo de Balzategui. This man had said he found a small image of the Virgin with a child in her arms, hidden in a thorny bush, next to a cowbell. Upon seeing it, he exclaimed, Arantzan zu?!, meaning \"In the thorns, you?!\". This legend again appears in the first history of the sanctuary written by Franciscan Gaspar de Gamarra, twenty years later in 1648: Historian Padre Lizarralde, who created the sanctuary's coat of arms, based its design on the legend, and drew a thorn bush, out of which a star blooms, and with its light it scares away the dragon, sending it into the abyss. The legend reads \u201cArantzan zu\u201d. == The basilica == View of the sanctuary. In 1950 the works for the new basilica were started, and the building was inaugurated five years later. Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza and Luis Laorga were the leading architects, and other artists also took part in the work: *Lucio Mu\u00f1oz, the altarpiece *Jorge Oteiza, the sculptures of the Apostles *Eduardo Chillida, the entrance gates *Nestor Basterretxea, the paintings of the crypt *Xabier \u00c1lvarez de Eulate, the stained-glass windows The Franciscan convent has been a center for Basque culture even under Franco's repression. The main festivity in Arantzazu is on September 9. ==References== * Joxe Azurmendi, Joseba Intxausti, Javier Garrido, Migel Alonso Del Val (2007): The Sanctuary of Arantzatzu, Fontanellato: FMR, ==External links== * Arantzazu in the Bernardo Estorn\u00e9s Lasa - Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia (Euskomedia Fundazioa) (in Spanish) * Sanctuary main page Category:Churches in the Basque Country Category:Shrines to the Virgin Mary Category:Franciscan monasteries in Spain Category:Basilica churches in Spain Category:Roman Catholic shrines in Spain ",
