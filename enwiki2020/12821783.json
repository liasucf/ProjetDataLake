    "text": "The Grove Baronetcy, of Ferne House, in the parish of Donhead St Andrew in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 18 March 1874 for Thomas Grove, Liberal Member of Parliament for Wiltshire South and Wilton. The Grove family descends from John Grove, who settled in Wiltshire in the 15th century. A later member of the family, William Grove (d. 1582), briefly represented Shaftesbury in the House of Commons. He purchased the Ferne estate in 1563 and the manor of Sedgehill, Wiltshire in 1573; the latter continued in the Grove family, albeit reduced in size, until shortly after the death of the third baronet in 1962. The presumed fourth Baronet never successfully proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. As of 2007 the presumed fifth and present Baronet has also not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1962. ==Grove baronets, of Ferne House (1874)== *Sir Thomas Fraser Grove, 1st Baronet (1823\u20131897) *Sir Walter John Grove, 2nd Baronet (1852\u20131932) *Sir Gerald Grove, 3rd Baronet (1886\u20131962) *Walter Felipe Grove, presumed 4th Baronet (1927\u20131974) *Charles Gerald Grove, presumed 5th Baronet (born 1929) ==References== ==Sources== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
