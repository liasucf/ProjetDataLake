He won a PDC Pro Tour card by qualifying from the second day of Q School in 2016. He made his PDC European Tour debut in the 2016 International Darts Open in Riesa, Germany, where he whitewashed Austrian Michael Rasztovits 6\u20130 thanks to an opening 151 checkout. He was scheduled to play world number one Michael van Gerwen in the next round, but an ankle injury forced Van Gerwen to withdraw, giving Meikle a bye to round three, where he lost 6\u20132 to Yordi Meeuwisse. In 2018, he won his second PDC Development Tour title, defeating Rowby-John Rodriguez 5\u20133 in the final of Development Tour 11 in Wigan.
