    "text": "The Belgian provincial, municipal and district elections of 2018 took place on Sunday 14 October 2018. They are organised by the respective regions: * Brussels with 19 municipalities * Flanders with 5 provinces and 300 (down from 308) municipalities ** In the city of Antwerp, elections will also be held for its nine districts * Wallonia with 5 provinces and 262 municipalities ** In the German-speaking Community, the elections are organised by that community rather than the Walloon Region In the municipalities with language facilities of Voeren, Comines-Warneton and the 6 of the Brussels Periphery, the aldermen and members of the OCMW/CPAS council are directly elected. ==General== Although the laws governing local elections differ per region (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia) and per level (provinces, municipalities, districts and OCMW/CPAS), they are all similar, with all of the elections being held on the same second Sunday of October for a six-year term. Between the 2012 and 2018 local elections, elections were only held in May 2014 (European, federal and regional), giving an unusually long period without elections in Belgium. The next European, federal and regional elections will be held in May 2019, only a few months after the October 2018 local elections. ===Parties=== National political parties are mostly separated by language community. A lot of municipalities have local parties as well as a presence of national parties. Here are the most important national parties: * Dutch-speaking parties, generally contending in Flanders and Brussels: N-VA (nationalist), CD&V; (Christian democrats), sp.a (socialists), Open VLD (liberals), Groen (ecologists), Vlaams Belang (far-right), PvdA (Marxist) * French-speaking parties, generally contending in Wallonia and Brussels: PS (socialists), MR (liberals), D\u00e9FI (regionalists/liberals), CdH (Christian democrats), Ecolo (ecologists), PTB (Marxist) * German-speaking parties, generally contending in several German-speaking municipalities in Wallonia ===Voters=== All Belgian citizens aged 18 or over are automatically registered and are obligated to participate in the election. Foreigners, both EU and non-EU, have the right to register to vote. The number of voters is as follows as of 1 August 2018: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | !! rowspan=\"2\" | Belgians !! colspan=\"2\" | EU citizens !! colspan=\"2\" | Non-EU citizens !! rowspan=\"2\" | Total |- !

These municipalities do not belong to any province. Since 2014, the regional electoral legislation has been modified to forbid lists with only one candidate, officially to enforce the sex parity principle, officiously to evict lists from an Islamist party.Ordonnance assurant la pr\u00e9sence minimum de deux candidats sur une liste se pr\u00e9sentant aux \u00e9lections communales, Moniteur belge, 3 April 2014Parlement de la R\u00e9gion de Bruxelles- capitale, Compte rendu int\u00e9gral, S\u00e9ance pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re du vendredi 28 mars 2014 (s\u00e9ance du matin) This 'ISLAM' party's leader had announced in April that it would present lists in 14 out of 19 communes.Fran\u00e7ois Witvrouw, \"Le parti Islam sur les listes \u00e9lectorales de 14 des 19 communes bruxelloises\", L'Echo, 6 April 2018 Finally, there are only two, in Brussels and Molenbeek. A third one in Anderlecht, headed by the aforementioned leader who had been elected in 2012, was invalidated because it hadn't been able to collect 100 signatures for its act of presentation. In April and begin September several politicians, amidst big media interest for this minuscule party (2 councillors, less than 10 members), had announced they would submit a law proposal to forbid it as its leader had multiplied controversial attitudes towards women and announcements that he aimed to introduce sharia in Belgium. The definitive candidates lists have been published online on 21 September 2018, there are 4,104 candidates on 152 lists, they were 3,965 in 2012.Official lists of candidates in the Brussels-Capital Region, 21 September 2018 ===Brussels=== Following the 2012 election, Freddy Thielemans (PS) continued as mayor, heading a coalition of socialists (PS-sp.a) and liberals (MR-Open Vld). In December 2013, Thielemans retired and was succeeded by Yvan Mayeur (PS). In 2017, a scandal emerged surrounding Samusocial, an organisation for homeless people where board members received excessive compensations for supposed meetings. Mayeur was forced to resign and was succeeded by Philippe Close (PS). The coalition was no longer supported by sp.a, and sp.a alderwoman Ans Persoons quit. Persoons and sp.a will contend the election on their own as Change.Brussels. An October 2017 poll showed the Green parties surpassing the socialists as largest party. In 2018, new financial-political scandals emerged regarding at least three organisations (Gial, Brinfin and Neo) where people were reimbursed as self-employed where they should have been actually employed. A debate among the main Dutch-speaking candidates was held on 4 September. Brussels is the only Belgian commune where two Islamic parties contend this election, Islam and its splinter party Salem, the first with two candidates (a father and his daughter), the second with three. Islam had 2 councillors in 2012, one in Anderlecht, the other in Molenbeek, both elected on one-person lists. The third list, in Brussels, failed to get a councillor elected in 2012. This time, the party has only been able to present lists of two candidates in Molenbeek and Brussels. There is a third Islamic party, limited to the province of Li\u00e8ge, the Movement for Education (MPE), which presents lists in three communes, Li\u00e8ge, Dison and Fl\u00e9ron, two one-candidate lists and one three-candidates list.

This coalition included former 'Nolsists', under the leadership of incumbent mayor Francis Duriau, the FDF of Bernard Clerfayt, Ecolo, the PSC and the PS (the Flemish SP competed apart, on a common list with a small local movement, IDS). The coalition was renewed in 2000, without the PSC but with the MR which competed under the Liste du Bourgmestre (Mayor's List) flag, uniting the former PRL and the FDF. In 2006, the coalition excluded the PS, which had among its councillors a controversial Turkish member of the Grey Wolves. This provoked the exclusion of Ecolo by the PS in the ruling coalitions e.g. in Brussels and Molenbeek. In 2012, the PS was maintained in the opposition, while the CDH (4 seats) entered it with 2 aldermen, and the local MR chapter broke up as the federal party forbade any common list with its former FDF partner, but a majority of the local chapter chose to go forward with the (predominantly FDF) Mayor's List as 'Independent Liberals'. The situation before the 2018 elections is quite different from the two previous ones. In 2006 and 2012, federal Vice-Premier Laurette Onkelinx led the PS list against the Mayor's List, overtly hoping to supersede it and take the mayorship. In both elections, the Ecolo list was led by a former federal leader, Isabelle Durant, who chose to keep its alliance with FDF Bernard Clerfayt. In 2017, both Durant and Onkelinx resigned from the municipal council and there are no notorious followers in sight.Belga, \"Laurette Onkelinx quitte le conseil communal de Schaerbeek\", Le Soir, 25 October 2017Jean-Claude Verset, \"Isabelle Durant: \"C'est le probl\u00e8me des partis qui occupent trop longtemps le pouvoir\"\", RTBF Info, 16 June 2017 PS federal deputy Ahmed Laaouej declined the offer to move from Koekelberg to Schaerbeek to replace her.Karim Fadoul, \"Ahmed Laaouej \u00e0 Schaerbeek: un signe de plus ou un signe de moins\", RTBF Info, 27 October 2016\"Le d\u00e9put\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9ral Ahmed Laaouej conduira la liste PS \u00e0 Koekelberg\", La Libre Belgique, 8 June 2017 In 2015, the CDH fraction was halved with the exclusion of Regional deputy Mahinur \u00d6zdemir, officially for refusing to recognize the existence of the 1915 Armenian Genocide.

Below are a few key dates set out in the Act applied to these elections: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%;\" ! Deadline !! Subject !!

A May 2017 proposal to lower the voting age to 16 was blocked by government party N-VA.De N-VA zegt nee tegen stemrecht op 16 jaar, 29 May 2017, deredactie.be Minister of Local Government Homans defined by order of 31 May 2018 the 163 municipalities that vote electronically; the other 145 municipalities vote by paper ballot. Fifteen Flemish municipalities will merge into seven per 1 January 2019, when the legislative period elected in these elections starts. This reduces the number of Flemish municipalities from 308 to 300. By order of 25 May 2018, the Flemish Government defined the number of councillors to be elected. In total, 7,398 municipal councillors will be elected in Flanders, a decrease of 66 compared to 2012. Thirty municipalities see an increase of two councillors, whereas in Ardooie and Ypres the population decreased, leading to a decrease of two councillors. The overall decrease however is mostly due to the merging of municipalities. ===Political background=== Campaign posters in Kortrijk The following political parties have a common regional list numbers: # sp.a # N-VA # CD&V; # Groen # Vlaams Belang # Open Vld While N-VA has replaced CD&V;'s longstanding dominance nationally (in the 2010 and 2014 elections), the latter party retains its advantage on a local level. N-VA was able to break through in a lot of places locally in 2012, but CD&V; remained the largest party in many municipalities, especially in rural ones. Open Vld has strongholds both in rural and urban areas; for example the mayors of Mechelen and Kortrijk are Open Vld members. Sp.a tends to dominate in cities; however, it lost Antwerp in 2012 to N-VA, and Hasselt's mayoralty to CD&V; in 2016. Gent's and Leuven's sp.a mayors are retiring, posing further threats to the party's power in cities. Sp.a chairman John Crombez suggested he would quit if his party's results are bad. Groen only has two mayors, and Vlaams Belang is nowhere in power. ===Provincial elections=== The provincial councils of Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, East Flanders, West Flanders and Limburg will be elected. The Flemish Government reduced the total number of provincial councillors from 351 to 175: 31 instead of 63 for Limburg and 36 instead of 72 for the other four provinces. Councillors are elected for a six-year term, starting on the first working day in December following the elections, thus 3 December 2018. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" ! style=\"width:9%;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! style=\"width:15%;\" colspan=\"3\" | ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | ! style=\"width:20%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Total |- !

Fifteen municipalities will be merged into seven, effective 1 January 2019, thus elections will be held for 300 rather than the current 308 municipalities. In each municipality, 7 to 55 councillors will be elected at- large depending on the population as of 1 January 2018. Councillors are elected for a six-year term, starting on the first working day in January following the elections, thus 2 January 2019. ====Provincial capitals==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! style=\"width:15%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Antwerp ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Ghent ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Leuven ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Hasselt ! style=\"width:14%;\" colspan=\"3\" | Bruges |- !

On 17 November 2016, CD&V; announced that Deputy Prime Minister Kris Peeters will move from Puurs to Antwerp to be their main candidate. This will pit two of the most popular politicians against each other in the biggest city of Flanders. Secretary of State Philippe De Backer will be Open Vld's main candidate, whereas Filip Dewinter will again be the candidate of Vlaams Belang. The pan-European party Volt Europa will team up with the local Pirate Party and field one list under the name \"Paars\" (\"Purple\"). On 13 October 2017, sp.a and Groen announced they would form a joint list, including independents, under the name Samen (\"together\"), led by Groen politician Wouter Van Besien, and third place for sp.a politician . However, following scandals involving Meeuws, Groen decided to end the collaboration in January 2018. Sp.a decided to field independent Jinnih Beels as main candidate, with second place for Meeuws. Kris Peeters surprisingly said he has a chance of becoming mayor even if his party CD&V; only receives 5% of the vote and is needed for a coalition. The elections resulted in a narrow majority for the incumbent coalition, leading De Wever to look for a different coalition. Initially he tried with Groen, but their positions are too different. Eventually N-VA, sp.a and Open Vld formed a coalition.

Mathias De Clercq will remain the main candidate of Open Vld, which will thus be the only major list headed by the same candidate as in 2012. One of the main topics is the implementation of a traffic circulation plan in 2017, which increased the car-free area in the city centre and divided the city into several zones for access by car, in order to improve air quality and stimulate public transportation and cycle use. The sp.a-Groen kartel lost significantly, mostly the sp.a faction, but together they remained the largest bloc. Open Vld gained significantly, becoming the largest single party. Open Vld wants to cooperate with CD&V.; Since neither bloc has a majority, the four parties will try forming a coalition together, but it was uncertain at first as to whether Filip Watteeuw (Groen) or Mathias De Clercq (Open Vld) will become mayor. On 30 November, the four parties announced the formation of their coalition with De Clercq as mayor.
