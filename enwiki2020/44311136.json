As a scholar, he is tremendously productive. Although he does not speak Tibetan and is not a specialist of Tibetan culture, he \"balances this lack with profound understanding of world history and international law.\" He views law and political science as his main areas of expertise. His stand on Tibet-related issues is akin to that of China, whose historical and legal claims to Tibet he supports. As this is not a fashionable stand in Western countries, \"he has become a controversial figure.\" On the other hand, \"because he is so well- informed and his research is so thorough,\" he is often asked to put across pro-Chinese positions in venues dealing with Tibet. == Criticism == On account of his refutation of the claim of a physical and cultural genocide in Tibet, his underlining of the various benefits, rights, and material gains Tibetans have reaped from the region's modernization, and his indictment of what he calls \"ethnonationalism\" on the part of exile Tibetans,Dina Duck, Tibet under Chinese Rule, Human Rights and Human Welfare, pp. 17-28, more specially p. 25. Barry Sautman has drawn criticism from writers supportive of an independent or free Tibet such as Jamyang NorbuJamyang Norbu, A Losar gift for rangzen activists , Phayul.com, February 26, 2009. and Elliot Sperling.Elliot Sperling, The History Boy, Rangzen Alliance, June 24, 2010.Jamyang Norbu criticizes Sautman for his selective use of dubious facts and figures, writing in academic gobbledygook, and jumping to conclusions without citing evidence.Jamyang Norbu.
