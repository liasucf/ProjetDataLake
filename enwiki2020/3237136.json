    "text": "Pablo the Little Red Fox is a British-French animated series which originally ran from March 1999 until 2015 on CBBC and CBeebies. The hero is a little red fox called Pablo and his siblings called Pumpkin and Poppy, their parents, Red Fox and Rose, a dog named Baxter, a hedgehog named Helena, a cat named Finbar, a frog called Fromage, a seagull called Gil and an owl named Madam Owl. The action often takes place at night, when the three little fox cubs go out and explore the city, from circus tents, artist's studios and the local museum. Pablo often leads them astray but somehow they always get out of trouble and find a way back home, to their cosy den at the bottom of Hannah's garden. The graphic style of the cartoons has intense colours and white outlines, reminiscent of silk paintings and Hannah Giffard's original water colour illustrations. The series concept was created by Hannah Giffard, the writer and illustrator of the original books called 'Red Fox' and 'Red Fox on the move' published by Frances Lincoln. Hannah Giffard worked closely on the series as an editor and creator of many of the story lines. She also worked with the art director and director to create the characters and backgrounds for the series. The theme music was composed by Rowland Lee, the lyrics were written by John Grace (who was a writer for the show), and was sung by Clewborough House School, Camberley. The show won a BAFTA in 2000 for best international children's program. At one point, the show aired on Playhouse Disney as part of their Mini Movies interstitials and PBS Kids Sprout. The show has also aired on Nick Jr, Disney Channel, MBC 3, CBeebies, ZDF, MiniMini+, NRK, RT\u00c9, ATV World and La Cinqui\u00e8me. It also aired on ABC Television in Australia from 30 August 2000 to 14 May 2009. It aired briefly between early morning programs on the Armed Forces Network. It also airs on GMA Network in the Philippines. ==External links== * *Official website of Pablo the Little Red Fox * Category:1990s British children's television series Category:2000s British children's television series Category:1990s British animated television series Category:2000s British animated television series Category:1999 British television series debuts Category:2000 British television series endings Category:British children's animated adventure television series Category:British television shows based on children's books Category:British animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:French television shows based on children's books Category:French animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:English-language television shows Category:BAFTA winners (television series) Category:Nick Jr. original programming Category:Treehouse TV original programming Category:BBC children's television shows Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation original programming Category:Animated television series about foxes Category:Animated television series about siblings ",
