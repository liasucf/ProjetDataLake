    "text": "I'd Climb the Highest Mountain is a 1951 Technicolor religious drama film made by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation. It was directed by Henry King and produced by Lamar Trotti from a screenplay by King and Trotti. The story is based on a 1910 novel by Corra Harris about a minister and his wife in southern Appalachia in the early 20th century. The music score was by Sol Kaplan and the cinematography by Edward Cronjager. The film stars Susan Hayward and William Lundigan with Rory Calhoun, Barbara Bates, Gene Lockhart, Alexander Knox and Lynn Bari. The movie was shot in the Appalachian Mountains of Georgia, an unusual and out-of-the-way location at the time. (By an odd coincidence, star Susan Hayward moved to another part of rural Georgia a few years later, settling down to farm and ranch with her second husband when she was not making films. The couple are buried near the town of Carrollton.) ==Plot summary== William Thompson (William Lundigan) is a minister from the Deep South who has recently married Mary Elizabeth (Susan Hayward), a woman from the city. William is assigned a new parish and moves with his wife to a town in Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountains, where he tends to the spiritual and emotional needs of his small flock. The poverty and isolation of the region, and the everyday problems of local people, put a strain on the couple's faith and marriage.http://www.allmovie.com/movie/id-climb-the-highest- mountain-v96127 ==Cast== * Susan Hayward as Mary Elizabeth Eden Thompson * William Lundigan as Rev.
