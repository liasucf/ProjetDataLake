    "text": "3,5-Lutidine is a heterocyclic organic compound with the formula (CH3)2C5H3N. It is one of several dimethyl-substituted derivatives of pyridine, all of which are referred to as lutidines. It is a colorless liquid with mildly basic properties and a pungent, noxious odor. The compound is a precursor to the drug omeprazole. It is produced industrially by condensation of acrolein, ammonia, and formaldehyde. == Biodegradation == The biodegradation of pyridines proceeds via multiple pathways. Although pyridine is an excellent source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for certain microorganisms, methylation significantly retards degradation of the pyridine ring. ==Safety== The is 200 mg/kg (oral, rats). == See also == * 2,6-Lutidine * 2,4-Lutidine == References == Category:Pyridines Category:Non-nucleophilic bases ",
