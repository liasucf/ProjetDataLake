Castle Rock, WA: Castle Rock Christian Church History, Chapter 2. http://www.cr-cc.org/history/Chapter%20II.%201900-1919.pdf For their honeymoon, E. R. and Bessie Moon attended the Oregon Convention of Christian Churches in Turner, Oregon in 1908 where they heard Royal J. Dye talk about the need for missionaries to the Congo. E.R. asked his wife and she responded \"It looks like a direct call to us.\" They were accepted and departed for the Congo in November 1908.Moon, E. R. I Saw Congo. Indianapolis, IN: The United States Christian Missionary Society, 1952. Both Dr. Moon and his wife became fluent in the native Lonkundo language. He translated portions of the Bible into that language. E. R. Moon was an accomplished hunter and builder. He repaired many of the buildings and built several new ones at Logombe. At the new mission at Mondombe, some 500 miles upriver from Logombe, he erected all of the buildings, including a brick church, starting in 1920. He taught native men construction trades. His wife taught the natives in day schools, translated numerous books into the native languages, and managed the orphanage.They Went to Africa: Biographies of Missionaries of the Disciples of Christ.

They had two year-long furloughs and were to return to the U.S., first on the RMS Titanic and the second time on the RMS Lusitania. Fortunately they missed both ships, the first time because E. R. was stuck on a sandbar, and the second time because the family was quarantined in Belgium. Jesse and later Eleanor were raised by their maternal grandparents in Washington State while their parents were in the Congo. ==S.S. Oregon== At the same time as the Moons accepted the call to serve, a plea went out for funds to purchase a boat to provide transportation for the missionaries on the Congo River. Prior to that, the missionaries had used dugout canoes. The Oregon Churches took up this call and raised the funds for the boat, which was built by Tom Rees and Sons, shipbuilders in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was assembled and dedicated in October 1909 at the centennial celebration of the Disciples of Christ Church. It was then taken apart and transported in 1200 different packages by ship and narrow-gauge railway to Kinshasa, now East Leopoldville, on Stanley Pool, in Africa where the British Baptist Mission Society had a station. E. R. Moon had training as a carpenter and, along with Robert Wilson, assembled the S. S. Oregon from June to October 1910. It was a wood-burning, shallow draft stern wheel river steamer that was 90 feet long and had an 18-foot beam. It had a steel hull that contained about 20,000 rivets. It had a main deck and one upper deck.Schillios, R. Harlow. \u201cS. S. Oregon Sails the Congo.\u201d Northwest Rotogravure Magazine, July 15, 1956, 18-19. The native name for the steamship was \"Nsang'ea ndoci\" which means \"Good News,\" appropriate for a missionary undertaking.SS Oregon on Congo River - E. R. Moon is third from left, his wife Bessie is second from left E. R. Moon was the first captain. In 1917 a young native and former slave, John Inkima, started work on the S. S. Oregon; he became captain in 1920 and stayed for almost 30 years. The ship was remodeled in 1935 and a partial third deck added. The steamship continued to serve the missions until it was sold in 1950.\u201cRetired Missionary Recalls 15 Years in Equatorial Africa.\u201d Eugene Register-Guard, November 20, 1955, Section C. The bell from the S. S. Oregon is now housed at the Disciples of Christ Historical Society in Nashville, Tennessee. As part of the effort to expand the missionary field in the Congo, an expedition was undertaken as authorized by the Missionary Conference at Bolenge in May 1916. The expedition lasted for 162 from late May to early November 1816. Four missionaries, E. R. Moon, W. A. Frymire, E. A. Johnston, and W. R. Holder, were given the commission for this expedition. They made use of the S. S. Oregon for much of the journey up two tributaries of the Congo River: the Ubangi and the Ngiri.Moon, E. R., Frymire, W. A., Johnston, E. A., and Holder, W. R.

They mapped the rivers, collected information on the various tribes, and developed an action plan for expansion of missionary activity. ==I Saw Congo== This book, published in 1952, after E. R. Moon retired from active service, recounts his 15 years experiences as a missionary in the Belgian Congo. Written in the first person, it starts with his and Bessie's arrival off the coast of Africa and concludes with their return to the United States. Throughout he talks about his adventures and relations with the natives. He also discusses the flora and fauna of the area. Apparently he became a pretty proficient hunter to provide food for the villages he visited. The book is organized as follows: *Foreword *A Twelve Thousand Mile Honeymoon Trip *Part One - River and Jungle Trail Chapter I - Steamboat on the Congo Chapter II - The Game Trail Chapter III - Snakes, Fish, Insects *Part Two - Congo Village Life Chapter I - The Congo Village Chapter II - Marriage Customs and Names Chapter III - Language and Communication Chapter IV - Folk-Songs, Proverbs, Fables *Part Three - Congo's Old and New Faiths Chapter I - Old Beliefs and Practices Chapter II - A New Faith Takes Root Chapter III - A Mission Station is Opened *Sunset or Dawn? The book provides a glimpse of village life and describes many of the customs of the natives at the time. His particular attention to the language is important because he translated sections of the Bible into the native language. The third part focuses on issues related to his mission - spreading the Christian message. This is set in the context of the native religion. This section also describes how he and his wife opened up the new station at Mondombe. ==Later activities== After his time in Africa, E. R. Moon served as a professor at the College of Missions in Indianapolis, Indiana from 1924 to 1929 and then as a professor in the College of Religion at Butler University from 1929 to 1933. From 1933 to 1938 he pastored various churches in Indiana and was then called to Jamaica from 1938 to 1944. After that they settled in Springfield, Oregon. E. R. Moon was a frequent speaker on his Congo experiences at various Christian Churches. ==Academic background== He received a Bachelor of Oratory (BO) degree in 1903 and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1906, both from Eugene Divinity School; a Bachelor of Divinity (BD) degree in 1918 and a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree in 1924, both from Eugene Bible University; and finally a Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1926 from the College of Missions. ==Awards and honors== He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London in 1927 and was awarded the Royal Order of Lion by the King of Belgium for his explorations on the Congo River. ==References== Category:American Congregationalist missionaries Category:Congregationalist missionaries in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Belgian Congo people Category:1879 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Northwest Christian University alumni Category:American expatriates in the Belgian Congo Category:American Disciples of Christ Category:Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) missionaries Category:People from Castle Rock, Washington Category:People from Marion County, Oregon ",
