The plot, as described by the government of Burkina Faso, targeted President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 \u2013 who, together with Lingani and Zongo, had previously carried out two coups in the country. All known conspirators were quickly executed. ==History== Compaor\u00e9, Lingani and Zongo had gotten to know each other in the late 1970s, in what was then the Republic of Upper Volta, as low-ranking officers and members of the Communist Officers' Group, a clandestine left-wing movement. Another member was Thomas Sankara, a close friend of Compaor\u00e9. In 1982 the four aided Major Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo in overthrowing Colonel Saye Zerbo. After Sankara, Lingani and Zongo were arrested by Ou\u00e9draogo in 1983, Compaor\u00e9 launch a military coup on 3 August to rescue his friends and comrades, overthrowing Ou\u00e9draogo and making Sankara the country's leader, the other three becoming the principal members of the ruling junta. Together they set about a radical transformation of society, called the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\". On 15 October 1987, Compaor\u00e9, Lingani and Zongo joined together to overthrow and murder Sankara. A new junta was declared under the \"Popular Front\", with Comapor\u00e9 becoming President of the renamed Burkina Faso. Lingani and Zongo maintained their positions, as Minister of Popular Defence and Minister of Economic Promotion. The triumvirate of the three set out to undo Sankara's far-left reforms, although their cooperation would come to end after two years. Burkinab\u00e9 authorities allege that on 18 September 1989, while President Compaor\u00e9 was on a state visit to China, a planned coup was discovered by Captain Gilbert Diend\u00e9r\u00e9, commander of the Regiment of Presidential Security. The plot, found out just prior to Comapor\u00e9's return to the country, was supposed to have taken place the moment Compaor\u00e9 landed in Ouagadougou. Sources differ on how he was to be met \u2013 some say he was supposed to be arrested upon arrival, others that the plane was to be blown up. Lingani and Zongo, the no. 2 and 3 most powerful people in the country, were named as the instigators of the coup attempt, and denounced as fascists. A communique read in state radio stated: \"Our people and revolution, and its militants at all levels, have just escaped, on the night of Sept. 18, 1989, a cowardly plot fomented by military and fascist elements led by some ambitious and anti- revolutionary people who are at the very top of the political leadership.\" Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani, Henri Zongo and two unnamed conspirators were quickly arrested and summarily executed once the reported plot was discovered. Compaor\u00e9's rule would go on for another twenty-five years, until his overthrow in the 2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising. ==See also== * History of Burkina Faso ==References== Burkina Faso Category:1989 in Burkina Faso Category:Attempted coups d'\u00e9tat Burkina Faso Category:History of Burkina Faso Category:Military coups in Burkina Faso Category:September 1989 events in Africa ",
