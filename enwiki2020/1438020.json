    "text": "\"Fools Gold\" and \"What the World Is Waiting For\" are two songs by British rock band the Stone Roses. They were released together as a double A-side single on 13 November 1989 through Silvertone Records. \"Fools Gold\" would go on to appear on certain non-UK versions of their self-titled debut studio album (1989). \"Fools Gold\" became the band's biggest commercial hit at the time. It was their first single to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart and stayed in the top-75 for fourteen weeks, peaking at number eight. ==Recording and composition== \"Fools Gold\" and \"What the World Is Waiting For\" were recorded at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall during the late summer of 1989, with additional vocal and guitar parts recorded later at London's Battery Studios, during the autumn of 1989. The tracks had been worked on for four months, and the intention was to put \"What the World Is Waiting For\" as the A side; however, when Roddy Mckenna, Silvertone's A&R; man, heard \"Fools Gold\" he urged the band to use that as the A-side. The band were not completely convinced, and it was agreed, instead, to release the two tracks as a double A-side. \"Fools Gold\" has been described as a Madchester, dance-rock, and funk rock song. The dance-oriented song showcased the rhythm section of Mani on bass and Reni on percussion. Ian Brown stated the song was written over \"The Funky Drummer\" by James Brown, which Reni had to learn the beat from. John Squire also plays guitar with various wah-wah pedal effects. Ian Brown sings the vocals in a whispered delivery. He would also perform with this technique for the track \"Something's Burning\". The bassline was inspired by \"Know How\" by Young MC, which is a sample from the Shaft theme song, performed by Isaac Hayes. The lyrics reference Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" and Marquis de Sade. The verses were inspired by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. ==Release== The single was released in 1989 and entered the UK top ten. It was promoted with a music video, showing The Stone Roses performing outdoors and walking across the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, Canary Islands. The cover art was a painting by John Squire, \"Double Dorsal Doppleg\u00e4nger\", which was later exhibited at Squire's 2004 art exhibition. The band's appearance on the same November Top of the Pops as the Happy Mondays, who performed \"Hallelujah\" from the Madchester Rave On EP, is regarded as a \"cultural high-water mark\", exposing the emerging Madchester scene to a wider audience, and popularizing a new dance-oriented music genre, baggy. Although a non-album double A-sided single, both tracks have appeared on the compilation albums Turns into Stone, The Complete Stone Roses and The Very Best of The Stone Roses. Both tracks have also appeared on some reissued editions of their debut album The Stone Roses, although Fools Gold has appeared more often than What The World Is Waiting For. ==Legacy== In May 2007, NME magazine placed \"Fools Gold\" at number 32 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. In 2009, listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J voted \"Fool's Gold\" number 76 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time. ==Track listing== ===1989 UK release=== ;7\" vinyl (Silvertone ORE 13) # Fools Gold 4.15 (4:15) # What the World Is Waiting For (3:55) ;12\" vinyl (Silvertone ORE T 13) # Fools Gold 9.53 (9:53) # What the World Is Waiting For (3:55) ;Cassette (Silvertone ORE C 13) CD (Silvertone ORE CD 13) # Fools Gold 9.53 (9:53) # What the World Is Waiting For (3:55) # Fools Gold 4.15 (4:15) ===1990 US release=== ;12\" gold vinyl (Silvertone 1315-1-JD) Cassette (Silvertone 1315-4-JS) CD (Silvertone 1315-2-JD) # Fools Gold 9.53 (9:53) # What the World Is Waiting For (3:55) # Fools Gold 4.15 (4:15) ===1990 Japanese release=== ;CD (Silvertone/Alfa 18B2-103) # What The World Is Waiting For (3:55) # Fools Gold (12\" mix) (9:53) # She Bangs The Drums (12\" mix) (3:43) # Elephant Stone (4:51) # Guernica (4:23) # Going Down (2:26) ===Fools Gold 1992 UK reissue=== 12\" vinyl, Cassette and CD the same as 1989 releases ;CD2 (Silvertone ORE CD Z 13) # Fools Gold (The Top Won Mix!)
