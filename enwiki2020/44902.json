    "text": "In phonology, vowel harmony is an assimilatory process in which the vowels of a word have to be members of the same class (thus \"in harmony\"). In languages with vowel harmony, there are constraints on which vowels may be found near each other. Vowel harmony is found in many agglutinative languages. Suffixes and prefixes will usually follow vowel harmony rules. ==Terminology== The term vowel harmony is used in two different senses. In the first sense, it refers to any type of long distance assimilatory process of vowels, either progressive or regressive. When used in this sense, the term vowel harmony is synonymous with the term metaphony. In the second sense, vowel harmony refers only to progressive vowel harmony (beginning-to-end). For regressive harmony, the term umlaut is used. In this sense, metaphony is the general term while vowel harmony and umlaut are both sub-types of metaphony. The term umlaut is also used in a different sense to refer to a type of vowel gradation. This article will use \"vowel harmony\" for both progressive and regressive harmony. ==\"Long-distance\"== Harmony processes are \"long-distance\" in the sense that the assimilation involves sounds that are separated by intervening segments (usually consonant segments). In other words, harmony refers to the assimilation of sounds that are not adjacent to each other. For example, a vowel at the beginning of a word can trigger assimilation in a vowel at the end of a word. The assimilation occurs across the entire word in many languages. This is represented schematically in the following diagram: :{| cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 110%;\" ! before assimilation | ! after assimilation | |- | VaCVbCVbC | \u2192 | VaCVaCVaC | (Va = type-a vowel, Vb = type-b vowel, C = consonant) |} In the diagram above, the Va (type-a vowel) causes the following Vb (type-b vowel) to assimilate and become the same type of vowel (and thus they become, metaphorically, \"in harmony\"). The vowel that causes the vowel assimilation is frequently termed the trigger while the vowels that assimilate (or harmonize) are termed targets. When the vowel triggers lie within the root or stem of a word and the affixes contain the targets, this is called stem-controlled vowel harmony (the opposite situation is called dominant).van der Hulst, H., & van de Weijer, J. (1995). Vowel harmony. In J. A. Goldsmith (Ed.), The handbook of phonological theory (pp. 495\u2013534). Oxford: Blackwell. This is fairly common among languages with vowel harmony and may be seen in the Hungarian dative suffix: :{| cellspacing=\"5\" ! Root ! Dative ! Gloss |- | | | 'city' |- | | | 'joy' |} The dative suffix has two different forms . The form appears after the root with back vowels ( and are back vowels). The form appears after the root with front vowels ( and are front vowels). ==Features of vowel harmony== Vowel harmony often involves dimensions such as {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Some languages have more than one system of harmony. For instance, Altaic languages are proposed to have a rounding harmony superimposed over a backness harmony. Even among languages with vowel harmony, not all vowels need to participate in the vowel conversions; these vowels are termed neutral. Neutral vowels may be opaque and block harmonic processes or they may be transparent and not affect them. Intervening consonants are also often transparent. Finally, languages that do have vowel harmony often allow for lexical disharmony, or words with mixed sets of vowels even when an opaque neutral vowel is not involved. Van der Hulst & van de Weijer (1995) point to two such situations: polysyllabic trigger morphemes may contain non-neutral vowels from opposite harmonic sets and certain target morphemes simply fail to harmonize. Many loanwords exhibit disharmony. For example, Turkish , ('time' [from Arabic ]); * would have been expected. ==Languages with vowel harmony== ===Korean=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\" |+ Korean Vowel Harmony |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Positive/\"light\" (Yang )/Plus Vowels (Yangseong moeum) | (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || ( ) |- | (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || ( ) || ( ) |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Negative/\"dark\" (Eum )/Minus Vowels (eumseong moeum) | (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) || (, ) |- | (, )) || (, ) || (, , ) || (, ) || ( ) || (, ) |- ! |Neutral (Jung )/Centre Vowels (jungseong moeum) | colspan=\"6\" | (, ) |} There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. These categories loosely follow the front (positive) and mid (negative) vowels. Middle Korean had strong vowel harmony; however, this rule is no longer observed strictly in modern Korean. In modern Korean, it is only applied in certain cases such as onomatopoeia, adjectives, adverbs, conjugation, and interjections. The vowel () is considered a partially neutral and a partially negative vowel. There are other traces of vowel harmony in modern Korean: many native Korean words tend to follow vowel harmony such as (, 'person'), and (, 'kitchen'). ===Mongolian=== {| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- ! -RTR | \u044d[] || \u04af[] || \u04e9[] || \u0438[] |- ! +RTR | \u0430[] || \u0443[] || \u043e[] |- |} Mongolian exhibits both a tongue root harmony and a rounding harmony. In particular, the tongue root harmony involves the vowels: (+RTR) and (-RTR). The vowel is phonetically similar to the -RTR vowels, however, it is largely transparent to vowel harmony. Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, . Some sources refer to the primary harmonization dimension as pharyngealization or patalalness (among others), but neither of these is technically correct. Likewise, referring to \u00b1RTR as the sole defining feature of vowel categories in Mongolian is not fully accurate either. In any case, the two vowel categories differ primarily with regards to tongue root position, and \u00b1RTR is a convenient and fairly accurate descriptor for the articulatory parameters involved.Svantesson, J.-O., Tsendina, A., Karlsson, A., & Franz\u00e9n, V.

Other vowels also could be found in loanwords, but they are seen as Back vowels. Tatar language also has a rounding harmony, but it is not represented in writing. O and \u00f6 could be written only in the first syllable, but vowels they mark could be pronounced in the place where \u0131 and e are written. ====Kazakh==== Kazakh's system of vowel harmony is primarily a front/back system, but there is also a system of rounding harmony that is not represented by the orthography. ====Kyrgyz==== Kyrgyz's system of vowel harmony is primarily a front/back system, but there is also a system of rounding harmony, which strongly resembles that of Kazakh. ====Turkish==== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Turkish Vowel Harmony ! colspan=\"4\" | Front || colspan=\"4\" | Back |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Unrounded|| colspan=\"2\" | Rounded || colspan=\"2\" | Unrounded || colspan=\"2\" | Rounded |- !

Complex system | colspan=\"2\" | i || colspan=\"2\" | \u00fc || colspan=\"2\" | \u0131 || colspan=\"2\" | u |} Turkish has a 2-dimensional vowel harmony system, where vowels are characterised by two features: [\u00b1front] and [\u00b1rounded]. There are two sets of vocal harmony systems: a simple one and a complex one. The simple one is concerned with the low vowels e, a and has only the [\u00b1front] feature (e front vs a back). The complex one is concerned with the high vowels i, \u00fc, \u0131, u and has both [\u00b1front] and [\u00b1rounded] features (i front unrounded vs \u00fc front rounded and \u0131 back unrounded vs u back rounded). The close-mid vowels \u00f6, o are not involved in vowel harmony processes. =====Front/back harmony===== Turkish has two classes of vowelsfront and back. Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. T\u00fcrkiye'de \"in Turkey\" but Almanya'da \"in Germany\". {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |+Turkish vowel harmonyExamples from |- ! Nom.sg ! Gen.sg. ! Nom.pl ! Gen.pl. !

This gives constructions such as T\u00fcrkiye'dir \"it is Turkey\", kap\u0131d\u0131r \"it is the door\", but g\u00fcnd\u00fcr \"it is day\", paltodur \"it is the coat\". =====Exceptions===== Not all suffixes obey vowel harmony perfectly. In the suffix -(i)yor, the o is invariant, while the i changes according to the preceding vowel; for example s\u00f6n\u00fcyor \u2013 \"he/she/it fades\". Likewise, in the suffix -(y)ken, the e is invariant: Roma'dayken \u2013 \"When in Rome\"; and so is the i in the suffix -(y)ebil: inan\u0131labilir \u2013 \"credible\". The suffix -ki exhibits partial harmony, never taking a back vowel but allowing only the front-voweled variant -k\u00fc: d\u00fcnk\u00fc \u2013 \"belonging to yesterday\"; yar\u0131nki \u2013 \"belonging to tomorrow\". Most Turkish words do not only have vowel harmony for suffixes, but also internally. However, there are many exceptions. Compound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (thus forms like |g\u00fcn \"this|day\" = \"today\" are permissible). Vowel harmony does not apply for loanwords, as in otob\u00fcs \u2013 from French \"autobus\". There are also a few native modern Turkish words that do not follow the rule (such as anne \"mother\" or karde\u015f \"sibling\" which used to obey vowel harmony in their older forms, ana and kar\u0131nda\u015f, respectively). However, in such words, suffixes nevertheless harmonize with the final vowel; thus annesi \u2013 \"his/her mother\", and voleybolcu \u2013 \"volleyball player\". In some loanwords the final vowel is an a, o or u and thus looks like a back vowel, but is phonetically actually a front vowel, and governs vowel harmony accordingly. An example is the word saat, meaning \"hour\" or \"clock\", a loanword from Arabic. Its plural is saatler. This is not truly an exception to vowel harmony itself; rather, it is an exception to the rule that a denotes a front vowel. Disharmony tends to disappear through analogy, especially within loanwords; e.g. H\u00fcsn\u00fc (a man's name) < earlier H\u00fcsni, from Arabic husn\u00ee; M\u00fcsl\u00fcman \"Moslem, Muslim (adj. and n.)\" < Ottoman Turkish m\u00fcslim\u00e2n, from Persian mosalm\u00e2n). ===Uralic languages=== Many, though not all, Uralic languages show vowel harmony between front and back vowels. Vowel harmony is often hypothesized to have existed in Proto-Uralic, though its original scope remains a matter of discussion. ====Samoyedic==== Vowel harmony is found in Nganasan and is reconstructed also for Proto-Samoyedic. ====Hungarian==== =====Vowel types===== {| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- ! Front | e || \u00e9 || i || \u00ed || \u00f6 || \u0151 || \u00fc || \u0171 |- ! Back | a || \u00e1 || - || - || o || \u00f3 || u || \u00fa |- |} Hungarian, like its distant relative Finnish, has the same system of front, back, and intermediate (neutral) vowels but is more complex than the one in Finnish, and some vowel harmony processes. The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (karba \u2013 in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (k\u00e9zbe \u2013 in(to) the hand). Single-vowel words which have only the neutral vowels (i, \u00ed or \u00e9) are unpredictable, but e takes a front-vowel suffix. One essential difference in classification between Hungarian and Finnish is that standard Hungarian (along with 3 out of 10 local dialects) does not observe the difference between Finnish '\u00e4' and 'e' the Hungarian front vowel 'e' is closely pronounced as the Finnish front vowel '\u00e4' . 7 out of the 10 local dialects have the vowel \u00eb which has never been part of the Hungarian alphabet, and thus is not used in practice. =====Behaviour of neutral vowels===== {| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- |colspan=2 align=right| ||open||middle||closed |- |colspan=2 align=center| Back (\"low\") | a \u00e1 || o \u00f3 || u \u00fa |- |rowspan=2 align=center| Front (\"high\")||unrounded (neutral) | || e \u00e9 || i \u00ed |- |rounded | || \u00f6 \u0151 || \u00fc \u0171 |- |} Unrounded front vowels (or Intermediate or neutral vowels) can occur together with either back vowels (e.g. r\u00e9pa carrot, kocsi car) or rounded front vowels (e.g. tet\u0151, t\u00fcnd\u00e9r), but rounded front vowels and back vowels can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. sof\u0151r = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. r\u00e9p\u00e1|ban in a carrot, kocsi|ban in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels i or \u00ed, for which there is no general rule, e.g. liszt|et, hid|at). Some other rules and guidelines to consider: * Compound words get suffix according to the last word, e.g.: \u00e1rt\u00e9r (floodplain) compound of \u00e1r + t\u00e9r gets front vowel suffix just as the word t\u00e9r when stands alone (t\u00e9r|en, \u00e1rt\u00e9r|en) * In case of words of obvious foreign origins: only the last vowel counts (if it is not i or \u00ed): sof\u0151r|h\u00f6z, n\u00fcansz|szal, gener\u00e1l|\u00e1s, okt\u00f3ber|ben, parlament|ben, szoftver|rel ** If the last vowel of the foreign word is i or \u00ed, then the last but one vowel will be taken into consideration, e.g. pap\u00edr|hoz, Rashid|dal. If the foreign word includes only the vowels i or \u00ed then it gets front vowel suffix, e.g.: Mitch-nek ( = for Mitch) ** There are some non-Hungarian geographical names that have no vowels at all (e.g. the Croatian island of Krk), in which case as the word does not include back vowel, it gets front vowel suffix (e.g. Krk-re = to Krk) * For acronyms: the last vowel counts (just as in case of foreign words), e.g.: HR (pronounced: h\u00e1-er) gets front vowel suffix as the last pronounced vowel is front vowel (HR-rel = with HR) * Some 1-syllable Hungarian words with i, \u00ed or \u00e9 are strictly using front suffixes (g\u00e9p|re, m\u00e9ly|r\u0151l, v\u00edz > viz|et, h\u00edr|ek), while some others can take back suffixes only (h\u00e9j|ak, sz\u00edj|r\u00f3l, ny\u00edl > nyil|at, zs\u00edr|ban, \u00edr|\u00e1s) * Some foreign words that have fit to the Hungarian language and start with back vowel and end with front vowel can take either front or back suffixes (so can be optionally considered foreign word or Hungarian word): farmer|ban or farmer|ben =====Suffixes with multiple forms===== Grammatical suffixes in Hungarian can have one, two, three, or four forms: * one form: every word gets the same suffix regardless of the included vowels (e.g. -kor) * two forms (most common): words get either back vowel or front vowel suffix (as mentioned above) (e.g. -ban/-ben) * three forms: there is one back vowel form and two front vowel forms; one for words of which last vowel is rounded front vowel and one for words of which last vowel is not rounded front vowel (e.g. -hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z) * four forms: there are two back vowel forms and two front vowel forms (e.g. -ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t or simply -t, if the last sound is a vowel) An example on basic numerals: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- |colspan=3| |align=\"middle\"| -kor (at, for time) |align=\"middle\"| -ban/-ben (in) |align=\"middle\"| -hoz/-hez/-h\u00f6z (to) |-ot/-at/-et/-\u00f6t (accusative) |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Back |(regular stem) |hat (6) | rowspan=\"4\" |hatkor nyolckor h\u00e1romkor egykor n\u00e9gykor kilenckor \u00f6tkor kett\u0151kor | rowspan=\"2\" |hatban nyolcban h\u00e1romban | rowspan=\"2\" |hathoz nyolchoz h\u00e1romhoz |hatot |- |(low-vowel stem)|| nyolc (8) h\u00e1rom (3) |nyolcat h\u00e1rmat |- | rowspan=\"2\" align=\"middle\" |Front |unrounded (neutral) || egy (1) n\u00e9gy (4) kilenc (9) | rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"middle\" | egyben n\u00e9gyben kilencben \u00f6tben kett\u0151ben | align=\"middle\" |egyhez n\u00e9gyhez kilenchez |egyet n\u00e9gyet kilencet |- |rounded || \u00f6t (5) kett\u0151 (2) | align=\"middle\" | \u00f6th\u00f6z kett\u0151h\u00f6z |\u00f6t\u00f6t kett\u0151t |} ====Mansi==== Vowel harmony occurred in Southern Mansi. ====Khanty==== In the Khanty language, vowel harmony occurs in the Eastern dialects, and affects both inflectional and derivational suffixes. The Vakh-Vasyugan dialect has a particularly extensive system of vowel harmony, with seven different front-back pairs: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Front | || || || || || |- ! Back | || || || || || |} The vowels , (front) and (back) can only occur in the first syllable of a word, and do not actively participate in vowel harmony, but they do trigger it. Vowel harmony is lost in the Northern and Southern dialects, as well as in the Surgut dialect of Eastern Khanty. ====Mari==== Most varieties of the Mari language have vowel harmony. ====Erzya==== The Erzya language has a limited system of vowel harmony, involving only two vowel phonemes: (front) versus (back). Moksha, the closest relative of Erzya, has no phonemic vowel harmony, though has front and back allophones in a distribution similar to the vowel harmony in Erzya. ====Finnic languages==== Vowel harmony is found in most of the Finnic languages. It has been lost in Livonian and in Standard Estonian, where the front vowels \u00fc \u00e4 \u00f6 occur only in the first (stressed) syllable. South Estonian V\u00f5ro (and Seto) language as well as some [North] Estonian dialects, however retain vowel harmony. =====Finnish===== A diagram illustrating vowel harmony in Finnish. Finnish vowel harmony and case agreement exemplified by mahdollisissa yll\u00e4tt\u00e4viss\u00e4 tilanteissa (\"in possible unexpected situations\"): mahdollinen takes -ssa, yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4 takes -ss\u00e4 and tilanne, with a neutral vowel first but a back vowel second, takes -ssa. In the Finnish language, there are three classes of vowelsfront, back, and neutral, where each front vowel has a back vowel pairing. Grammatical endings such as case and derivational endingsbut not encliticshave only archiphonemic vowels U, O, A, which are realized as either back or front inside a single word. From vowel harmony it follows that the initial syllable of each single (non-compound) word controls the frontness or backness of the entire word. Non-initially, the neutral vowels are transparent to and unaffected by vowel harmony. In the initial syllable: # a back vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with back (or neutral) vowels, e.g. pos+ahta+(t)a \u2192 posahtaa # a front vowel causes all non- initial syllables to be realized with front (or neutral) vowels, e.g. r\u00e4j+ahta+(t)a \u2192 r\u00e4j\u00e4ht\u00e4\u00e4. # a neutral vowel acts like a front vowel, but does not control the frontness or backness of the word: if there are back vowels in non-initial syllables, the word acts like it began with back vowels, even if they come from derivational endings, e.g. sih+ahta+(t)a \u2192 sihahtaa cf. sih+ise+(t)a \u2192 sihist\u00e4 For example: * kaura begins with back vowel \u2192 kauralla * kuori begins with back vowel \u2192 kuorella * sieni begins without back vowels \u2192 sienell\u00e4 (not *sienella) * k\u00e4yr\u00e4 begins without back vowels \u2192 k\u00e4yr\u00e4ll\u00e4 * tuote begins with back vowels \u2192 tuotteessa * ker\u00e4 begins with a neutral vowel \u2192 ker\u00e4ll\u00e4 * kera begins with a neutral vowel, but has a noninitial back vowel \u2192 keralla Some dialects that have a sound change opening diphthong codas also permit archiphonemic vowels in the initial syllable. For example, standard 'ie' is reflected as 'ia' or 'i\u00e4', controlled by noninitial syllables, in the Tampere dialect, e.g. ti\u00e4 \u2190 tie but miakka \u2190 miekka. ... as evidenced by tuotteessa (not *tuotteess\u00e4). Even if phonologically front vowels precede the suffix -nsa, grammatically it is preceded by a word controlled by a back vowel. As shown in the examples, neutral vowels make the system unsymmetrical, as they are front vowels phonologically, but leave the front/back control to any grammatical front or back vowels. There is little or no change in the actual vowel quality of the neutral vowels. As a consequence, Finnish speakers often have problems with pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, olympia is often pronounced olumpia. The position of some loans is unstandardized (e.g. chattailla/ch\u00e4tt\u00e4ill\u00e4 ) or ill-standardized (e.g. polymeeri, sometimes pronounced polumeeri, and autorit\u00e4\u00e4rinen, which violate vowel harmony). Where a foreign word violates vowel harmony by not using front vowels because it begins with a neutral vowel, then last syllable generally counts, although this rule is irregularly followed. Experiments indicate that e.g. miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri always becomes (front) miljon\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4, but marttyyri becomes equally frequently both marttyyria (back) and marttyyri\u00e4 (front), even by the same speaker. With respect to vowel harmony, compound words can be considered separate words. For example, syyskuu (\"autumn month\" i.e. September) has both u and y, but it consists of two words syys and kuu, and declines syys\u00b7kuu\u00b7ta (not *syyskuut\u00e4). The same goes for enclitics, e.g. taaksep\u00e4in \"backwards\" consists of the word taakse \"to back\" and -p\u00e4in \"-wards\", which gives e.g. taaksep\u00e4ink\u00e4\u00e4n (not *taaksep\u00e4inkaan or *taaksepainkaan). If fusion takes place, the vowel is harmonized by some speakers, e.g. t\u00e4ll\u00e4inen pro t\u00e4llainen \u2190 t\u00e4m\u00e4n lainen. Some Finnish words whose stems contain only neutral vowels exhibit an alternating pattern in terms of vowel harmony when inflected or forming new words through derivation. Examples include meri \"sea\", meress\u00e4 \"in the sea\" (inessive), but merta (partitive), not *mert\u00e4; veri \"blood\", verest\u00e4 \"from the blood\" (elative), but verta (partitive), not *vert\u00e4; pel\u00e4t\u00e4 \"to be afraid\", but pelko \"fear\", not *pelk\u00f6; kipu \"pain\", but kipe\u00e4 \"sore\", not *kipea. Helsinki slang has slang words that have roots violating vowel harmony, e.g. S\u00f6rkka. This can be interpreted as Swedish influence. ===Yokuts=== Vowel harmony is present in all Yokutsan languages and dialects. For instance, Yawelmani has 4 vowels (which additionally may be either long or short). These can be grouped as in the table below. {| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em\" |- ! || Unrounded || Rounded |- ! High | || |- ! Low | || |- |} Vowels in suffixes must harmonize with either or its non- counterparts or with or non- counterparts. For example, the vowel in the aorist suffix appears as when it follows a in the root, but when it follows all other vowels it appears as . Similarly, the vowel in the nondirective gerundial suffix appears as when it follows a in the root; otherwise it appears as . {| | -hun/-hin || || (aorist suffix) |- | mu\u1e6dhun || || 'swear (aorist)' |- | giy\u0313hin || || 'touch (aorist)' |- | gophin || || 'take of infant (aorist)' |- | xathin || || 'eat (aorist)' |- | -tow/-taw || || (nondirective gerundial suffix) |- | goptow || || 'take care of infant (nondir. ger.)' |- | giy\u0313taw || || 'touch (nondir. ger.)' |- | mu\u1e6dtaw || || 'swear (nondir. ger.)' |- | xattaw || || 'eat (nondir. ger.)' |} In addition to the harmony found in suffixes, there is a harmony restriction on word stems where in stems with more than one syllable all vowels are required to be of the same lip rounding and tongue height dimensions. For example, a stem must contain all high rounded vowels or all low rounded vowels, etc. This restriction is further complicated by (i) long high vowels being lowered and (ii) an epenthetic vowel which does not harmonize with stem vowels. ===Sumerian=== There is some evidence for vowel harmony according to vowel height or ATR in the prefix i3/e- in inscriptions from pre-Sargonic Lagash (the specifics of the pattern have led a handful of scholars to postulate not only an phoneme, but even an and, most recently, an ) Many cases of partial or complete assimilation of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable are reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable though not absolute tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables. What appears to be vowel contraction in hiatus (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ > a, */ae/ > a, */ue/ > u, etc.) is also very common. ===Other languages=== Vowel harmony occurs to some degree in many other languages, such as * Akan languages (tongue root position) * Australian Aboriginal languages ** Jingulu ** Warlpiri * Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (vowel harmony of one particular timbre across all vowels of a word) * Several Bantu languages such as: ** Standard Lingala (height) ** Kgalagadi (height)Derek Nurse, G\u00e9rard Philippson, The Bantu languages, Routledge, 2003. ** Malila (height) ** Phuthi (right-to-left and left-to-right) ** Southern Sotho (right-to-left and left-to-right) ** Northern Sotho (right-to-left and left-to-right) ** Tswana (right-to-left and left-to- right) * Bezhta * Some Chadic languages, such as Buwal * Chukchi * Coeur d'Alene (tongue root position and height) * Coosan languages * Dusun languages * Iberian languages ** Astur-Leonese\u00c1lvaro Arias. \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, Moenia 11 (2006): 111\u2013139. ** Galician and Portuguese dialects ** Catalan/Valencian ** Eastern Andalusian Spanish ** Murcian Spanish * Igbo (tongue root position) *Italo-Romance languages: several Swiss Italian dialects (including total vowel harmony systems). * Japanese language - in some of the Kansai dialects.

This effect is blocked by voiced obstruents and certain consonant clusters: \"baby\", \"lumpy\". * Somali * Takelma * Telugu * Tibetic languages * Tungusic languages, such as Manchu * Utian languages *Urhobo * Yurok is unique in having rhotic vowel harmony. ==Other types of harmony== Although vowel harmony is the most well-known harmony, not all types of harmony that occur in the world's languages involve only vowels. Other types of harmony involve consonants (and is known as consonant harmony). Rarer types of harmony are those that involve tone or both vowels and consonants (e.g. postvelar harmony). ===Vowel-consonant harmony=== Some languages have harmony processes that involve an interaction between vowels and consonants. For example, Chilcotin has a phonological process known as vowel flattening (i.e. post-velar harmony) where vowels must harmonize with uvular and pharyngealized consonants. Chilcotin has two classes of vowels: * \"flat\" vowels * non-\"flat\" vowels Additionally, Chilcotin has a class of pharyngealized \"flat\" consonants . Whenever a consonant of this class occurs in a word, all preceding vowels must be flat vowels. {| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" | || 'he's holding it (fabric)' |- | || 'apples' |- | || 'he'll stretch himself' |} If flat consonants do not occur in a word, then all vowels will be of the non-flat class: {| style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" | || 'I'll comb hair' |- | || 'I'll burn it' |- | || 'he laughs' |} Other languages of this region of North America (the Plateau culture area), such as St'\u00e1t'imcets, have similar vowel-consonant harmonic processes. ===Syllabic synharmony=== Syllabic synharmony was a process in the Proto-Slavic language ancestral to all modern Slavic languages. It refers to the tendency of frontness (palatality) to be generalised across an entire syllable. It was therefore a form of consonant\u2013vowel harmony in which the property 'palatal' or 'non-palatal' applied to an entire syllable at once rather than to each sound individually. The result was that back vowels were fronted after j or a palatal consonant, and consonants were palatalised before j or a front vowel. Diphthongs were harmonized as well, although they were soon monophthongized because of a tendency to end syllables with a vowel (syllables were or became open). This rule remained in place for a long time, and ensured that a syllable containing a front vowel always began with a palatal consonant, and a syllable containing j was always preceded by a palatal consonant and followed by a front vowel. A similar process occurs in Skolt Sami, where palatalization of consonants and fronting of vowels is a suprasegmental process applying to a whole syllable. Suprasegmental palatalization is marked with the letter \u02b9, which is a freestanding acute accent, for example in the word v\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9rr 'mountain, hill'. ==See also== * A-mutation * Apophony * Consonant harmony * Consonant mutation * Germanic umlaut * I-mutation * Metaphony * U-mutation ==References== ==Bibliography== * Arias, \u00c1lvaro (2006): \u00abLa armonizaci\u00f3n voc\u00e1lica en fonolog\u00eda funcional (de lo sintagm\u00e1tico en fonolog\u00eda a prop\u00f3sito de dos casos de metafon\u00eda hisp\u00e1nica)\u00bb, Moenia 11: 111\u2013139. * * Jacobson, Leon Carl.
