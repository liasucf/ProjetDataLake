Van Kreveld completed his Ph.D. in 1992 at Utrecht University. His dissertation, New Results on Data Structures in Computational Geometry, was supervised by Mark Overmars. He is a professor of computer science at Utrecht University. With Ferran Hurtado, van Kreveld was co-chair of the 2011 Symposium on Computational Geometry. He has also worked in geographic information systems, and (with J\u00fcrg Nievergelt, Thomas Roos, and Peter Widmayer) is the author of the textbook Algorithmic Foundations of Geographic Information Systems (Springer, 1997). ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Dutch computer scientists Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms Category:Utrecht University alumni Category:Utrecht University faculty ",
