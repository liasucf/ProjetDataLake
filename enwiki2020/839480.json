    "text": "The Han twins murder conspiracy was a case of attempted murder of Sunny Han by her identical twin sister Jeen \"Gina\" Han, occurring on November 6, 1996 in Irvine, California. Both are Korean-born American citizens. It quickly became a sensationalized story in the media. The case brought together several themes, including surviving a broken family through a close sisterly bond, a \"good\" twin sister and an \"evil\" twin sister who were co-valedictorians at their high school. Jeen Han was imprisoned at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, CA in 1998 with a sentence of 26 years to life in prison. Twenty years later, in May 2018, she was granted parole by California's Board of Parole. ==Aftermath== In November 1999, an American Justice documentary titled \"Sister Against Sister: The Twin Murder Plot\" aired on A&E;, covering the sensational details of the case. The program was hosted by Bill Kurtis. In 2001, the case was profiled on The Investigators under the title \"Evil Twin\". In 2005, Snapped, a series about true crime on the Oxygen Network, ran an episode about Jeen's plot to kill her twin sister and take over her life. In 2012, this story became the focus of the pilot episode of the Investigation Discovery show, \"Evil Twins\". ==References== ==External links== *\"Family feud leads to twin's murder plot.\" Associated Press at Beloit Daily News.
