It is located in what is now part of the Shimizu-ku area of Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. ==History== Okitsu-juku was established in 1601, just before the beginning of the Edo period. At its peak, there were approximately 316 buildings and 1,668 people. Among the buildings were two honjin, two sub- honjin and 34 hatago. It was a little over 11 kilometers from the preceding post station, Yui-shuku. The classic ukiyo-e print by And\u014d Hiroshige (H\u014deid\u014d edition) from 1831\u20131834 depicts two sumo wrestlers being carried across the Okitsu River, one on a packhorse and the other in a kago. ==Neighboring post towns== ;T\u014dkaid\u014d :Yui-shuku - Okitsu-juku - Ejiri-juku ==Further reading== *Carey, Patrick.
