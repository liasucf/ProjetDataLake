    "text": "Eophis is an early genus of stem-snake (clade Ophidia) containing one species, Eophis underwoodi, from the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) from the Forest Marble Formation of United Kingdom. It is known from a fragmentary dentary from Kirtlington Quarry. It was previously interpreted as an anguimorph lizard. The placement of Eophis as a stem snake was re-affirmed by subsequent analyses. == Phylogeny == Cladogram based in the phylogenetic analysis by Caldwell et al.
