She was launched as K\u00f6nig David 1623 in Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) and initially served as a merchant ship. During the Polish wars with Sweden, it was drafted into the Polish navy along with Wodnik and Arka Noego. They fought in the Battle of Hel on May 17, 1627. After a short artillery duel the skirmish was over. The following day the escadrille met a convoy of 24 Swedish vessels off the coast of Bia\u0142a G\u00f3ra, near \u0141eba. After a short artillery barrage, the Polish ships managed to evade the enemy and headed for Kolberg (Ko\u0142obrzeg). Several days afterwards the escadre managed to break through the Swedish blockade and returned to Wis\u0142ouj\u015bcie, one of two main bases of the Polish Navy.Georg Wislicenus, Willy St\u00f6wer: Deutschlands Seemacht nebst einem \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Geschichte der Seefahrt aller V\u00f6lker. p. 44, 2007, Under the command of a Scottish captain and shipbuilder Jakub Murray, the ship took part in the victorious battle of Oliwa of November 28, 1627. However, the ship played only a minor role and failed to support Wodnik in her attack on Swedish galleon Solen yet received some damage. After the battle the command was given to Gregor Fentross, who also became the admiral of the Polish fleet. Thus K\u00f6nig David became the flagship of the entire Polish Navy. However, during the Swedish assault on Wis\u0142ouj\u015bcie of July 6, 1628, admiral Fentross was killed and the ship received some damage due to artillery fire. All Polish ships were withdrawn up the Vistula river. In January 1629, the ship was rented by king Sigismund III Vasa to the Habsburg-led Catholic League and served during the Thirty Years' War. Stationed in Wismar, the ship fought against Danish and Swedish fleets at the Baltic Sea and the Northern Sea. In November 1630, however, chased by a Swedish pursuit escadre, K\u00f6nig David was forced to seek refuge in L\u00fcbeck and was then interned by the locals. Further fate of the ship remains unknown. Category:Tall ships of Poland Category:Ships built in Gda\u0144sk Category:1620s ships ",
