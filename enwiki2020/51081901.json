    "text": "Sahrawi activist Tecber Ahmed Saleh explains the origins of Sahrawi nationalism, 2019. Sahrawi nationalism is a political ideology that seeks self-determination of the Sahrawi people, the indigenous population of Western Sahara. It has historically been represented by the Polisario Front. It came as a reaction against Spanish colonialist policies imposed from 1958 on, and subsequently in reaction to Mauritanian and Moroccan invasions of 1975. Its main opposing ideologies have been Spanish colonialism (Spanish Sahara, 1884\u20131975), Mauritanian irredentism (Tiris al-Gharbiyya, 1975\u20131979), Moroccan irredentism (Southern Provinces, 1975-present) and Pan-Arabism. ==See also== *Sahrawi nationality law *Decolonization of Africa *UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara ==References== ",
