    "text": "Steve Turner is a former computer game musician and designer. His development team, Graftgold, mostly wrote for games published by Hewson Consultants during the 1980s. The first computer he bought was a ZX80 which had to be assembled by hand. At school he was a member of a computing club where he learnt the Algol 60 programming language. During the 1970s he added Cobol to his repertoire from a government funded training course. He went on to a programming job in the Civil Service. Turner was 30 when he decided to move into games development. His first game was written whilst he was still employed as a programmer and he handed his notice in when he received his first royalty cheque.https://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/developer/steve- turner/ He also wrote a series of articles for ZX Computing between August 1986 and January 1987, called The Professional Touch.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=Programming%3a+The+Professional+Touch&loadpics;=on ==List of games== For Hewson Consultants: *3D Space Wars (1983) *3D Seiddab Attack (1984) *3D Lunattack (1984) *Avalon (1984) *Dragontorc (1985) *Astroclone (1985) *Uridium (1986) (music) *Quazatron (1986) *Ranarama (1987) *Zynaps (1987) (music) *Magnetron (1988) ==References== ==External links== *World of Sinclair entry, with links to interviews from ZX Computing and Sinclair User. *Graftgold Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Video game musicians Category:British video game designers Category:Video game programmers Category:British computer programmers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
