He is interested in the diversity, paleoecology, and evolutionary history of Mesozoic tetrapods, especially archosaurian reptiles and cynodont therapsids, and the history of biology and paleontology. Sues has discovered a number of new dinosaurs and other extinct terrestrial vertebrates in Mesozoic continental strata around the world. He has authored or co-authored over 150 articles and book chapters on vertebrate paleontology and paleoecology. Sues has written \"The Rise of Reptiles\" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2019) and \"Triassic Life on Land: The Great Transition\" (With N. C. Fraser; Columbia University Press, 2010). He has edited Evolution of Herbivory in Terrestrial Vertebrates (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000) and co-edited Terrestrial Ecosystems through Time (with A. K. Behrensmeyer et al.; Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), In the Shadow of the Dinosaurs: Early Mesozoic Tetrapods (with N. C. Fraser; Cambridge Univ. Press, 1994), and Major Transitions in Vertebrate Evolution (with J. S. Anderson; Indiana Univ. Press, 2007). He is also active in promoting the value of natural history collections for addressing major questions in current science. Sues was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2003 and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1998.Who's Who in Canada.
