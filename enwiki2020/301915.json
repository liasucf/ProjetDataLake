    "text": "John Cocke (May 30, 1925 \u2013 July 16, 2002) was an American computer scientist recognized for his large contribution to computer architecture and optimizing compiler design. He is considered by many to be \"the father of RISC architecture.\" ==Biography== He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, US. He attended Duke University, where he received his Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1946 and his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1956. Cocke spent his entire career as an industrial researcher for IBM, from 1956 to 1992. Perhaps the project where his innovations were most noted was in the IBM 801 minicomputer, where his realization that matching the design of the architecture's instruction set to the relatively simple instructions actually emitted by compilers could allow high performance at a low cost. He is one of the inventors of the CYK algorithm (C for Cocke). He was also involved in the pioneering speech recognition and machine translation work at IBM in the 1970s and 1980s, and is credited by Frederick Jelinek with originating the idea of using a trigram language model for speech recognition.Jelinek, Frederick, \"The Dawn of Statistical ASR and MT\", Computational Linguistics, 35(4), 2009, pp. 483-494, doi: 10.1162/coli.2009.35.4.35401 Cocke was appointed IBM Fellow in 1972. He won the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 1985, ACM Turing Award in 1987,John Cocke, The search for performance in scientific processors: the Turing Award lecture. Communications of the ACM, Volume 31 Issue 3, March 1988, Pages 250-253. doi:10.1145/42392.42394 the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and the National Medal of Science in 1994, IEEE John von Neumann Medal in 1984, The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996, the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award in 1999, and The Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2000. In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum \"for his development and implementation of reduced instruction set computer architecture and program optimization technology.\" He died in Valhalla, New York, US. == References == == External links == * IBM obituary * Duke profile from 1988 By Eileen Bryn * Interview transcript * IEEE John von Neumann Medal Recipients Category:1925 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American computer scientists Category:Computer hardware engineers Category:Computer designers Category:Duke University alumni Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Turing Award laureates Category:National Medal of Science laureates Category:National Medal of Technology recipients Category:IBM Research computer scientists Category:Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award recipients Category:IBM employees Category:IBM Fellows Category:People from Charlotte, North Carolina Category:People from Valhalla, New York Category:Mathematicians from New York (state) Category:Duke University Pratt School of Engineering alumni Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences ",
