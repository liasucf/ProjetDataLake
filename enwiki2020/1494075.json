    "text": "Base point pricing is the system of firms setting prices of their goods based on a base cost plus transportation costs to a given market. Although some consider this a form of collusion between the selling firms (it lowers the ability of buying firms to gain a competitive advantage by location or private transportation), it is common practice in the steel and automotive industries. It allows firms to collude by simply agreeing on a base price. ==Types== # Point Pricing (-5 to +5 range) # Rebate Pricing (-5 to +5 range) # Bond Pricing (+95 to +105 range) A pricing approach that involves designating a particular geographic location as a basing point and then charging customers as a freight cost from that location to the location of the customer. Or a pricing method in which customers are charged freight cost from a base point; the base point may be chosen arbitrarily, but the location of one of the company's manufacturing plant is commonly used. ==See also== *Competition policy ==References== Category:Pricing ",
