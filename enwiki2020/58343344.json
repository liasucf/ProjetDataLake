    "text": "Luis Gallego S\u00e1nchez, better known as Luisito Rey (June 28, 1945 \u2013 December 9, 1992), was a Spanish singer-songwriter, better known as the father and first manager of singer Luis Miguel. == Early life == Luisito Rey was the son of Rafael Gallego Rey, a flamenco singer turned electrician, and Matilde S\u00e1nchez Repiso, a singer and dancer. His siblings are Vicente, nicknamed Tito, and Mario. From an early age he had a penchant for singing, composing and playing the guitar. His natural talent helped him to get out of Spain and travel through many countries, including Argentina, where he met his life companion, Italian model Marcela Basteri. His artistic name was originally Luisito Gas\u00e1n (combining the first syllables of his father's and mother's last name). He later settled for Luisito Rey, Luisito being the diminutive of Luis and Rey being his father's maternal surname. A bullfighter fan, his favorite toreador was Luis Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Lucas, better known as Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn, father of famous singer Miguel Bos\u00e9. In his honor, he named his firstborn son Luis Miguel Gallego. His first taste of success was with the song \"Frente a una copa de vino\" (In front of a glass of wine), a ballad classic that became his biggest and only major hit in Latin America. Nevertheless, he wasn't a one-hit wonder, as he had other hit songs, including La Gran Ciudad (The great city) and El Loco (The Crazy Man). == Reputation == Luisito Rey's reputation as a solid artist and able manager was greatly tarnished with the revelations of many of his acquaintances. Some, like Luis Miguel's godfather, renowned Puerto Rican psychologist Alfred D. Herger, have described him as a psychopath and abuser. Years earlier, Rey's brother Vicente stated that Rey would sometimes prostitute Luis Miguel's mother Marcela Basteri for drug binges. Dominican- born Mexican actor and family friend Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda revealed that Rey had taken advantage of him by asking to stay in an apartment which Garc\u00eda was paying for a female friend. Despite constant promises, Rey never reimbursed any of the rent to Garc\u00eda. Keeping with custom, Luis Miguel has said nothing publicly about his relationship with his father. Rey once stated that Pablo Picasso painted a small sketch of him, used in one of his greatest hits albums, and that singer Frank Sinatra was interested in recording La Gran Ciudad. None of these events were actually true. == References == Category:1945 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from C\u00e1diz Category:Andalusian singers Category:Latin music songwriters Category:Spanish composers Category:Spanish male composers Category:Spanish male singers Category:Spanish singer- songwriters Category:Spanish-language singers Category:20th-century singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
