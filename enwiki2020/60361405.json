This is in retaliation for the deaths of their fathers, the war of the Seven against Thebes, who had attempted the same thing. == Family == Thersander was the son of Polynices and Argea. He was succeeded by his son Tisamenus, whose mother was Demonassa.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 9.36.1 == Mythology == Thersander may have bribed Eriphyle with the robe of Harmonia so that she sent her son, Alcmaeon, to fight with him. His father did the same with Harmonia's necklace to convince her to send her husband with the original attackers. The attack of the Epigoni was successful, and Thersander became the king of Thebes.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.7.2 Thersander intended to fight for the Greeks during the Trojan War, but was killed by Telephus before the war began, while the Greeks had mistakenly stopped in Mysia. Pindar refers to Thersander as gaining honor after Polynices' death and preserving the house of Adrastus for later generations.Pindar, Olympian Odes 2.42\u201345 == Notes == == References == * Pausanias, Description of Greece with an English Translation by W.H.S.
