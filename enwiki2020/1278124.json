    "text": "The Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV manufactured by Toyota and derived from its Tundra pickup truck. Introduced in 2000 and manufactured at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton, Indiana, the Sequoia is the first vehicle from a Japanese marque in the popular mainstream full-sized SUV class in North America, and initial planning done by first-generation Sequoia chief engineer Kaoru Hosegawa aimed the Sequoia directly at the Ford Expedition and other full-size SUVs. The Sequoia slots in between the mid-size Toyota 4Runner and the premium Toyota Land Cruiser in the North American Toyota SUV lineup, and is the largest SUV currently being produced under the Toyota brand. As of 2017, the Sequoia is sold in the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. It is offered with LHD only. __TOC__ ==First generation (XK30/XK40; 2000\u20132007)== Development of a full-size SUV alongside a T100 replacement began in the mid-1990s, with a design freeze in 1997 (styled by Toshihiko Shirasawa) and design patent filing of the production design on April 4, 1998 at the Japan Patent Office (JPO) under #1054583. After the introduction of the Toyota Tundra in 1999, speculation started that Toyota intended to compete in the full-size market with a Tundra-based SUV called the Highlander. However, the Highlander name was used on a midsize Camry-based crossover and the Tundra- based SUV was introduced on January 11, 2000 at the North American Auto Show as the Toyota Sequoia, with full production starting in September 2000 for the 2001 model year. The engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis are shared with the Tundra, with the exception of rear disc brakes and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary Land Cruiser, larger than the Chevrolet Tahoe in most dimensions and similar in size to the Ford Expedition; its V8 engine was certified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. Frame assemblies and driveshafts are produced by Dana Holding Corporation. The Sequoia came in two trim levels: SR5 and Limited. It was sold in both two- wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions. Vehicle Stability Control was standard on all models. ===Facelift=== 2005\u20132007 Toyota Sequoia Limited For the 2005 model year, the Sequoia received a minor facelift. A new engine equipped with VVT-i was new for 2005, as well as a 5-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous 4-speed. 4 wheel drive models got a Torsen center differential, replacing the previous open differential, that splits power in full-time mode 40% front and 60% rear under normal driving, and can send up to 53% to the front and 71% to the rear during slip. The grill was redesigned, and the orange lamps were removed from the taillights. Towing Capacity for the 2005 model year: *2WD: *4WD: ==Second generation (XK60; 2008\u2013present)== The back of the Toyota Sequoia SR5 2018 Toyota Sequoia Toyota unveiled the 2008 Toyota Sequoia at the November 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show, with sales beginning that following December. Like the original Sequoia, the new model is based on the new Tundra. However major differences with the Tundra include a fully boxed frame, a rear independent suspension featuring double wishbones with coil springs for improved ride comfort and room, and a locking center differential on 4-wheel drive models. The new suspension helps give the Sequoia a tighter turning radius of and allows for a fold-flat rear seat. Toyota stated the new frame is 70 percent more resistant to bending flex with torsional rigidity up 30 percent However, the new model weighs more than the previous Sequoia. The drag coefficient has been reduced to 0.35. Improvements include an optional ULEV-II compliant 381 horsepower 5.7 L 3UR-FE V8, mated to a 6-speed automatic. The 2008 Sequoia came in three trim lines: the SR5 and Limited, and new Platinum. The base engine is the previous ULEV compliant 4.7 L 2UZ-FE V8 featured from the previous generation. The 4.7 L is standard on the SR5. Some of the earlier 2008 and 2009 SR5 models do come with the 5.7l as an option when purchasing, while the Limited and Platinum models come standard with a 5.7 L V8 engine.

Early 2003 Sequoias were recalled to reprogram the Vehicle Stability Control system due to the possibility of poor acceleration at certain low speeds. The 2002-2003 Sequoia model years also had a defect in the front ball joints. 2004 Toyota Sequoias were subject to the Takata Airbag recall done for free by Toyota dealerships. Recently, the Sequoia, along with the Tacoma and Tundra, have another recall due to the frame prematurely rusting. If there is a 10 mm perforation found on the frame, the vehicle frame will be replaced, if the service is done within 12 years of vehicle purchase or 1 year after recall became official. For those vehicles without 10 mm perforation and located in a cold weather state, Toyota will perform an undercoating service to prevent future rust from forming. ==References== ==External links== * Toyota Sequoia global site * 2nd generation Toyota Sequoia SUV site * Toyota press release detailing the launch of the 2008 Sequoia at the Los Angeles Auto Show. * Toyota's official pricing announcement of the 2008 Toyota Sequoia.
