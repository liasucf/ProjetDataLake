It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chard\u00f3n.Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia, Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938; p. 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chard\u00f3n, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an \"American\" propaganda institution.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 305 On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chard\u00f3n began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos \"Student Enemy Number One.\" In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chard\u00f3n and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States. ==The R\u00edo Piedras massacre== Don Pedro Albizu Campos in 1936 On October 24, 1935, a student assembly held at the university declared Albizu Campos as \"persona non grata.\" Chard\u00f3n requested that the governor provide armed police officers on the university grounds, in case the situation turned violent. Two police officers spotted a \"suspicious-looking vehicle\" and asked the driver, Ram\u00f3n S. Pag\u00e1n, and his friend Pedro Qui\u00f1ones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pag\u00e1n and Qui\u00f1ones.

The R\u00edo Piedras massacre left four men dead.\"Isolina Rond\u00f3n\", testimony, Peace Host ==The assassination of Elisha F. Riggs== Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood located in northwest Washington, D.C.. Riggs was a former officer in the United States Army who was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing sugar cane labor movement and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement.\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America\u2019s Colony\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); . The R\u00edo Piedras Massacre enraged the nationalists including Rosado and Beauchamps. The nationalists believed that Elisha F. Riggs was responsible since Riggs was the police chief of Puerto Rico and the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs. Beauchamps decided to retaliate with the help of Rosado. On Sunday, February 23, 1936, Elisha F. Riggs had attended mass in the Church of Santa Ana in San Juan. When the mass was over, Riggs stepped out of the church and got into his car, a Packard, driven by Angel Alvarez, a police officer. Rosado knew the route which Riggs would normally take and waited. When Riggs' car reached the corner of Allen and Gambaro Streets, Rosado came out of his hideout and began shooting towards Riggs. Rosado then made a run for it, but was soon captured by Alvarez. All the while, Riggs got out of his car and began asking for the declarations of those who witnessed the attempt on his life. He was suddenly approached by Beauchamps who said: Believing that he had a witness to the events Riggs told Beauchamps that he was headed to the police station and to accompany him. Beauchamps boarded Riggs chauffeured car and shot Riggs in the head killing him instantly. Beauchamp tried to escape and hid inside \"Rodriguez y Palacios\", a warehouse in Tetuan Street. Both men were arrested and taken to the San Juan police headquarters located in 305 San Francisco Street.

In the aftermath of the killings, the police claimed that the nationalists were shot because they attempted to escape. None of the police officers involved were demoted or suspended. The news of the assassination of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935\u20131937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn told Gruening that he would do so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial. ==Post assassination== After Riggs' assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned. Members of the Puerto Rican independence movement came under greater scrutiny and persecution. Among the leaders arrested was Pedro Albizu Campos, These leaders were charged with having \"conspired to overthrow\" the U.S. government on the island. They were tried in Boston, Massachusetts, as that federal district court had jurisdiction for Puerto Rico. The first trial jury refused to convict, and ended in a hung jury. A second jury was picked, consisting solely of \"Anglo-Americans.\" This jury found every Nationalist charged to be \"guilty\".Historical Timeline, PR Dream The bodies of both nationalists were returned to their respective families.
