The conflict began in 1454 with the assassination of Uesugi Noritada by Kant\u014d kub\u014d Ashikaga Shigeuji.Hall, John Whitney. (1988). The Cambridge History of Japan: Medieval Japan, p. 233. The Ashikaga, Uesugi, and other clans then leapt to battle, either defending or assaulting Shigeuji. The chaos ended in 1482, when a peace was negotiated. ==Chronology== Ashikaga Shigeuji was appointed to the post of Kant\u014d kub\u014d (sh\u014dguns deputy in the Kant\u014d region) in 1449, the first Ashikaga to hold the post since his father's death ten years earlier. At that point, in 1439, Uesugi Norizane had seized power for his clan. Ten years later, the Uesugi remained powerful in the Kant\u014d; in 1454, Shigeuji arranged to have his deputy, Uesugi Noritada, killed. This was taken as rebellion against the Ashikaga shogunate, and armed conflict quickly broke out. The Uesugi clan mobilized to attack Shigeuji, and , loyal to the shogunate, captured and burned Kamakura, which was the center of the Kant\u014d bureaucracy and Shigeuji's home. Shigeuji then fled the area, to Koga, in Shimotsuke Province, and became known as the Koga kub\u014d. The Uesugi called for the shogunate to send a new kub\u014d to replace Shigeuji, and in 1459, the sh\u014dguns brother, Ashikaga Masatomo, arrived to take up that position. However, Shigeuji's supporters refused to acknowledge this, and maintained Shigeuji's rightful claim to the post. Masatomo set up his new home in Horigoe, in Izu Province. As the fighting continued, both claimed to be on the side of the shogunate; but both sides prevented one another from wielding true power, and so the Uesugi were once again in control of the region. Due to their growing power and numbers, the Uesugi clan now split in three branches (Yamanouchi, \u014cgigayatsu, and Inukake), named after the localities within the Kant\u014d where they resided. The \u014cnin War broke out in Kyoto in 1467, signalling the end of the shogunate's real power and the beginning of the Sengoku period, a period of chaos and war which would last 150 years. Fighting in the Kant\u014d between the Ashikaga and Uesugi calmed for about ten years, resuming in 1477 and ending in 1482, with negotiations for peace. ==Notes== ==References== * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Louis (2002).
