These geckos live in tropical rain forests. They reach a total length of 330 mm. ==Etymology== The generic name, Uroplatus, is a Latinization of two Greek words: \"our\u00e1\" (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03ac) meaning \"tail\" and \"platys\" (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2) meaning \"flat\". Its specific name fimbriatus is the Latin word for \"fringed\" based upon the gecko's unique appearance of fringed skin. ==Description== It is a large nocturnal gecko. Because the eyes are extremely sensitive to light, 350 times more sensitive than the human eye, the species is able to see in colors even at night. By day it plasters itself to a small tree trunk and rests head down. If disturbed it will raise its tail and head, open its mouth and scream. ==Threats== Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to this animal's future as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the Uroplatus species on their \"Top ten most wanted species list\" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it \"being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade\". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the commercial export as likely sustainable. ==Gallery== File:UroplatusFimbriatus.JPG|Giant Leaf tail Gecko File:Leaf Tailed Gecko P9240101.JPG|Leaf Tailed Gecko File:Leaf Tailed Gecko P9240102.JPG|Leaf Tailed Gecko - from below File:Uroplatus fimbriatus (3).jpg|The underside of the Leaf Tailed Gecko clinging to glass File:Uroplatus fimbriatus 003.jpg|Camouflage of the gecko ==References== fimbriatus Category:Endemic fauna of Madagascar Category:Reptiles of Madagascar Category:Reptiles described in 1797 ",
