    "text": "Sir Roger Dalison, 1st Baronet (or Sir Roger Dallison or Dallyson) (c.1562 \u2013 1620), of Laughton, Lincolnshire was an English courtier, Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance and Member of Parliament. Arms of the Dalisons of Laughton He was born the eldest son of William Dalison of Laughton and educated at Exeter College, Oxford (1575) and Gray's Inn (1577). He succeeded his father in 1587 and was knighted in 1603. He attached himself to Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton and the latter's nephew, Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk. With the help of those connections he held a number of public commissions and offices, including those of Esquire of the Body (c.1605\u2013c.1608), Gentleman of the Privy Chamber (by 1615) and Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance from 1608 to 1616. He was elected Member of Parliament for Malmesbury in 1604 and 1614, a seat then under the control of the Earls of Suffolk. He served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1601\u201302. He purchased one of the earliest baronetcies in 1611 but was unable or unwilling to pay the whole price. He was also found to have embezzled large amounts of money from the Ordnance, and died intestate in 1620 as a debtor in the Fleet Prison. He had married 3 times; firstly after 1588 Anne, the daughter of Sir Valentine Browne of Croft, Lincolnshire, secondly Elizabeth, the daughter of Marmaduke Tyrwhitt, of Scotter, Lincolnshire and thirdly by 1592, Elizabeth, the daughter of William Tuthill of Newton, Norfolk. He left one surviving son and a daughter by his third wife. After his death, an irregularity was discovered in the register of baronets, which meant that the surviving son, Thomas, could not automatically inherit the baronetcy. On 27 October 1624 the baronetcy was therefore recreated for him but became extinct when the unmarried Sir Thomas was killed at the Battle of Naseby in 1645. ==References== Category:1560s births Category:1620 deaths Category:Alumni of Exeter College, Oxford Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:High Sheriffs of Lincolnshire Category:English MPs 1604\u20131611 Category:English MPs 1614 ",
