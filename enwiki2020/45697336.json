    "text": "Prestonfield is a football stadium in the royal burgh of Linlithgow, West Lothian, Scotland. It is the home stadium of Linlithgow Rose of the East of Scotland Football League. The stadium was opened in 1949 and currently consists of a covered and seated stand opposite a covered enclosure with the rest of the ground being concrete terracing. The current capacity is 2,264 of whom 301 can be seated. In July 2018, Livingston F.C. confirmed that their home ties in the 2018\u201319 Scottish League Cup Group stage would be held at Prestonfield, due to delays with the installation of a new artificial turf pitch at their own Almondvale Stadium, situated about from Linlithgow. ==References== Category:Sports venues in West Lothian Category:Linlithgow Rose F.C.
