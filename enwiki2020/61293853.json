In the village of Koili, in the province of Pafos, where Mavrokolympos flows, the waters gather and form a small waterfall. These waters over the centuries eroded the soil and formed a small lake. According to Greek mythology, this is where Adonis and Aphrodite would meet to spend time together. == References == Category:Paphos District Category:Geography of Cyprus ",
