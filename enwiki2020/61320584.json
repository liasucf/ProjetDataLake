Paralleling this interest were the Saturday art classes which she began at the age of ten and continued for ten years at the SA School of Arts and Crafts. In 1946 she graduated from Adelaide Teachers College, but within two years had given up teaching to go to Melbourne to dance. Soon art won out over dance and she held her first of many exhibitions in 1951. She held the first art therapy sessions at Kew Mental Hospital in the early 1950s. She also painted sets and costumes for the Ballet Guild. She attended part-time art classes at RMIT1952 - 55. In 1960-61 McGilchrist pursued postgraduate work in Munich at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste due to a grant from AGNSW Dyason Bequest. She then held exhibitions in Munich and London. With the advent of second wave feminism in the mid seventies Erica was at the forefront of promoting and recording women's art. She was a co-founder of Women's Art Register and served as convenor from 1978-89. == Works == Erica worked across various media including works on paper, embroidery and paintings.
