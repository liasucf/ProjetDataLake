The first prototype of the new trainer, designated Yak-UTI or Yak-3UTI flew in late 1945. It was based on the radial-powered Yak-3U, but with the new Shvetsov ASh-21 seven-cylinder radial replacing the ASh-82 of the Yak-3U.Gordon Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 249. It used the same all- metal wings as the Yak-3U, with a fuselage of mixed metal and wood construction. The pilot and observer sat in tandem under a long canopy with separate sliding hoods. A single synchronised UBS 12.7 mm machine gun and wing racks for two 100 kg (220 lb) bombs comprised the aircraft's armament.Gunston and Gordon 1997, p. 97. Let C-11 An improved prototype flew in 1946, with revised cockpits and a modified engine installation with the engine mounted on shock absorbing mounts. This aircraft successfully passed state testing in October 1946, with production beginning at factories in Saratov and Leningrad in 1947.Gunston and Gordon 1997, p. 99. Production Yak-11s were heavier than the prototypes, with later batches fitted with non-retractable tailwheels and revised propellers. A 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun was sometimes fitted instead of the UBS, while some were fitted with rear-view periscopes above the windscreen. In total, Soviet production amounted to 3,859 aircraft between 1947 and 1955. with a further 707 licence-built by Let in Czechoslovakia as the C-11.Gordon Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 250\u2013251. The Yak-11 set five world-class records. ==Yak-11U== In 1951, Yakovlev revised the design of the Yak-11, adding a retractable tricycle landing gear, with two variants proposed, the Yak-11U basic trainer and Yak-11T proficiency trainer, which carried similar equipment to contemporary jet fighters. The new aircraft had reduced fuel capacity and was unsuitable for operations on rough or snow- covered runways, and so was rejected for Soviet service, although a few examples were built in Czechoslovakia as the C-11U.Gordon Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 251. ==Operational history== Egyptian Air Force Yak-11 The Yak-11 entered service in 1947, serving as a standard advanced trainer with the Soviet Air Forces and DOSAAF.Gordon Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 250. Both the Yak-11 and C-11 were used in all Warsaw Pact countries and were exported to eighteen countries, including many African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries. North Korean Yak-11s were used in combat in the Korean War, with one Yak-11 being the first North Korean aircraft shot down by US forces when it was shot down by a North American F-82 Twin Mustang over Kimpo Airfield on 27 June 1950.Thompson 2001, pp. 160\u2013161. East Germany used the Yak-11 to intercept American reconnaissance balloons. ==Survivors== thumb Due to its Yak-3 lineage, the Yak-11 has recently seen widespread popularity among warbird enthusiasts. Highly modified versions of the Yak-11 can be frequently seen at air races. About 120 Yak-11s remain in airworthy condition. == Operators == Fighter/trainer aircraft Yakovlev Yak-11 (National People's Army) Preserved Yak-11 of the Polish Air Force Yakovlev Yak-11 disguised in wartime fighter camouflage ; *Royal Afghan Air Force received 14 aircraft from 1958.
