    "text": "Burkhard Dick (born 1963 in Brake, Lower Saxony) is a German ophthalmologist who has specialized in refractive and cataract surgery. With his many contributions to the scientific literature on this topic, he is considered one of the pioneers of employing the femtosecond laser in cataract surgery. In the \"Power List 2018\" ranking of the world's most influential ophthalmologists by the publication The Ophthalmologist, Burkhard Dick was listed among the Top 20. https://theophthalmologist.com/power-list/2018/ == Biography == Dick attended high school in his hometown of Brake and graduated in 1983. After studying medicine at University of Giessen, he began his specialization as an eye surgeon. As a board certified ophthalmologist, Dick in 1996 joined the eye hospital of the University of Mainz where he became a full professor in 2003. In 2006, Dick was appointed chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University of Bochum and director of the University Eye Clinic. He turned the clinic into one of the surgical centers with the highest number of cataract patients treated with the femtosecond laser, a new technology which has the potential to improve the precision of cataract surgerywith DS Grewal, T Schultz, S Basti S: Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery--current status and future directions. Surv Ophthalmol. 2016 Mar-Apr;61(2):103-31. doi: 10.1016/j.survophthal.2015.09.002.with I Conrad-Hengerer, M Al Sheikh, FH Hengerer, T Schultz: Comparison of visual recovery and refractive stability between femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and standard phacoemulsification: six-month follow-up.J Cataract Refract Surg. 2015 Jul;41(7):1356-64. doi: 10.1016/j.jcrs.2014.10.044. which is the most frequent surgical intervention in North America and Europe. Burkhard Dick is currently president of the German Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (DGII). == Scientific contributions == Dick has published a large number of scientific articles and book chapters on various issues in eye surgery. He has informed the medical community about his experience with the femtosecond laser in special cases like patients with Marfan syndrome,with T Schultz, E Ezeanosike: Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery in pediatric Marfan syndrome.
