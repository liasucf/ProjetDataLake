The color itself derives from the official hue of the Philolexian Society, the university's oldest student organization. Although Columbia blue is often identified with Pantone 292, the Philolexian Society first used it in 1852, before the standardization of colors. Pantone 290, a slightly lighter shade of blue, has also been specified by some Columbia University offices, and is the current official color listed by the Columbia University visual communications office. == Usage, symbolism, colloquial expressions == ===Fraternities and sororities=== Organizations, fraternities and sororities that use Columbia blue for their colors: * Delta Phi * Acacia * Lambda Kappa Sigma * Philolexian Society of Columbia University * Eta Chi Gamma of New York Institute of Technology ===School color=== Columbia blue is used as one of the two or three color symbols for the following colleges, universities and high schools: ===Sports=== * The Buffalo Braves, now Los Angeles Clippers. * The Denver Nuggets have worn Columbia blue road jerseys since the 2003\u201304 NBA season. * The Kansas Jayhawks football team used Columbia blue in the early 1960s and wore Columbia blue in an October 2011 homecoming football game against the Texas Tech Red Raiders to honor their 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl champions. * The Kansas City Royals \"powder blue\" uniforms that debuted in 2008 are actually Columbia blue. * The Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team wears their traditional Columbia blue jerseys instead of the university's official color Reflex blue. * The Memphis Grizzlies introduced an alternate Columbia blue road jersey in 2009, which is actually \"smoke blue.\" * The Tampa Bay Rays selected Columbia blue as one of its three color symbols in September 2007.
