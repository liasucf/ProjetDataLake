Links to * National Cycle Route 1 at Felixstowe and also near Bruisyard * NCR 51 at Felixstowe * RCR 42 at Snape ==Route== ===Woodbridge to Felixstowe=== Woodbridge | Waldringfield | Kirton | Felixstowe ===Felixstowe to Snape=== Felixstowe | Felixstowe Ferry | Bawdsey| Hollesley| Orford | Snape The route from Felixstowe to Snape takes one through the Suffolk Coast and Heaths, an area of outstanding natural beauty. From Felixstowe head for Felixstowe Ferry, a small hamlet next to the ferry itself. You may now take the Bawdsey Ferry across the River Deben. You next pass Bawdsey Manor where radar was developed and from time to time the original transmitter block is open to the public. Head north for Hollesley and just north of the village one has a choice of taking the Butley Ferry, which claims to be the smallest in Europe (and as a result does not take tandems) or go round the creek. If you can book the ferry it is well worth the effort as it adds interest and saves mileage. From Orford it is a simple on-road route to Snape and Snape Maltings. At Snape one can continue on this route to National Cycle Route 1 at Bruisyard or take Regional Route 42 to Minsmere and meet up with National Cycle Route 1 just South of Halesworth. ===Snape to Bruisyard=== Snape | Sweffling | Bruisyard ==External links== * OpenStreetMap cycle mapping for route 41 area * Tourist Information from Visit Suffolk' about cyclings along the coast * Discover Suffolk Coast and heaths * Get Cycling in Suffolk * Map from Sustrans Category:Cycleways in England Category:Transport in Suffolk ",
