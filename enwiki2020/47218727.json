He was a Member of Parliament for \u0130stanbul's second electoral district from the Democratic Left Party (DSP) from 1991 to 2002. He was also a Minister of State during the coalition government led by Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Y\u0131lmaz between 1997 and 1999. ==Early life and career== Of Circassian descent, \u00d6zkan was the youngest of seven children and was born in 1950 in the district of Develi, Kayseri. He was educated at Pertevniyal High School and graduated from Galatasaray School of Economics and Management (now Marmara University.http://www.kimkimdir.gen.tr/kimkimdir.php?id=425 In 1968, he was a contestant in the Golden Lantern Dance Competition along with T\u00fclin Aktan and came first. His brother, Necdet \u00d6zkan, was elected as the Mayor of \u0130stanbul's Bayrampa\u015fa district, after which he took over most of his family trade business.http://www.biyografi.info/kisi/husamettin-ozkan ==Political career== \u00d6zkan joined the DSP in 1991 and became a Member of Parliament for \u0130stanbul's second electoral district in the 1991 general election. He was perceived to be close to the party's leader B\u00fclent Ecevit. ===Minister of State=== Having been re-elected as a Member of Parliament in the 1995 general election, the DSP entered a triple coalition government along with the Motherland Party (ANAP) and Democrat Turkey Party (DTP). The DSP-DTP-ANAP coalition was formed after the coalition between the True Path Party and the Islamist Welfare Party broke down in 1997 as a result of the 1997 military memorandum. In the new coalition, ANAP leader Mesut Y\u0131lmaz became Prime Minister, while DSP leader B\u00fclent Ecevit and DTP member \u0130smet Sezgin became Deputy Prime Ministers. In this new government, \u00d6zkan was made Minister of State. ===Deputy Prime Minister=== The ANAP-DSP-DTP coalition broke down in 1999 after the T\u00fcrkbank scandal, with Ecevit forming a DSP-only minority government until the 1999 general election. \u00d6zkan was made Deputy Prime Minister in this new government, serving alongside Hikmet Ulu\u011fbay. During his time as Deputy, he dealt with issues such as the Capture of Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the Kurdish militant Kurdistan Workers' Party. The DSP polled the highest in the 1999 general election, with Ecevit forming a coalition with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the Motherland Party (ANAP). \u00d6zkan remained as Deputy Prime Minister, joined by the MHP's Devlet Bah\u00e7eli and ANAP's Mesut Y\u0131lmaz. During this government, he played a role in ensuring that the 2000 presidential election process did not result in parliamentary deadlock. ===New Turkey Party=== Concerns over Prime Minister B\u00fclent Ecevit's health resulted in rumours that DSP politicians were plotting to oust him as leader. This led to \u00d6zkan, who was rumoured to be one of the dissident DSP parliamentarians, resigning from the DSP and becoming a co-founder of the New Turkey Party (YTP) along with \u0130smail Cem. Many DSP MPs also joined the party, with the YTP heading for a strong showing in the 2002 general election. However, organisational difficulties and the decision of party member Kemal Dervi\u015f to defect to the Republican People's Party (CHP) led to the YTP winning just 1.13% of the vote and falling far below the 10% election threshold needed to win representation in Parliament. As a result, \u00d6zkan resigned from the party and retired from active politics.http://husamettin-ozkan-kimdir.cix1.info ===Legal investigations=== In 2004, \u00d6zkan was investigated by Parliament over claims that he assisted in protecting individuals at Halk Bank and stopping them from being investigated, thus causing financial damage to the Bank. In 2007, he was found not guilty. ==See also== *List of Deputy Prime Ministers of Turkey ==References== ==External links== *Collection of all relevant news items at Haberler.com Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Turkey Category:Democratic Left Party (Turkey) politicians Category:Members of the 20th Parliament of Turkey Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:People from Kayseri Category:Deputies of Istanbul ",
