    "text": "A sert\u00e3o (, plural sert\u00f5es) is the \"hinterland\" or \"backcountry\". In Brazil, it refers to one of the four sub-regions of the Northeast Region of Brazil (similar to the specific association of \"outback\" with Australia in English). Its borders are not precise. it is a region that is well-known in Brazilian culture, with a rich history and much folklore. Including the famous book of Brazilian literature called Os Sert\u00f5es written by the Brazilian author Euclides da Cunha Originally the term referred to the vast hinterlands of Asia and South America that Portuguese explorers encountered. In Brazil, it referred to backlands away from the Atlantic coastal regions where the Portuguese first settled in South America in the early sixteenth century. A Brazilian historian once referred to colonial life in Brazil as a \"civilization of crabs\", as most settlers clung to the shoreline, with few trying to make inroads into the sert\u00e3o. In modern terms, \"sert\u00e3o\" refers to a semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil, comprising parts of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Pernambuco, Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Piau\u00ed, Sergipe, and Minas Gerais. Geographically, the sert\u00e3o consists mainly of low uplands that form part of the Brazilian Highlands. Most parts of the sert\u00e3o are between and above sea level, with higher elevations found on the eastern edge in the Planalto da Borborema, where it merges into a sub-humid region known as agreste, in the Serra da Ibiapaba in western Cear\u00e1 and in the Serro do Periquito of central Pernambuco. In the north, the sert\u00e3o extends to the northern coastal plains of Rio Grande do Norte state, while to the south it ends gradually in the northern part of Minas Gerais. Two major rivers cross the sert\u00e3o, the Jaguaribe and further east the Piranhas, and the larger S\u00e3o Francisco River is in part in the sert\u00e3o. Smaller rivers dry up after the end of the rainy season. The term sert\u00e3o is also used in Portuguese to refer to the Brazilian hinterland in general, regardless of region. It is this sense that corresponds to sert\u00e3o music, m\u00fasica sertaneja, roughly \"country music\". To avoid ambiguity, the region in the northeast is sometimes called the sert\u00e3o nordestino, while the Brazilian hinterland may also be called the sertania, the land of sert\u00f5es. ==Climate and vegetation== Because the sert\u00e3o lies just south of the equator, temperatures are nearly uniform throughout the year and are typically tropical, often extremely hot in the west. However, the sert\u00e3o is distinctive in its low rainfall compared to other areas of Brazil. Because of the relatively cool temperatures in the South Atlantic Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone remains north of the region for most of the year, so that most of the year is very dry. Although annual rainfall averages between and over most of the sert\u00e3o and on the northern coast at Fortaleza, it is confined to a short rainy season. This season extends from January to April in the west, but in the eastern sert\u00e3o it generally occurs from March to June. However, rainfall is extremely erratic and in some years the rains are minimal, leading to catastrophic drought, while in others rains are extremely heavy and floods occur. This variability has caused extreme famines among subsistence farmers in the region, exacerbated by the extreme imbalance of land ownership throughout the sert\u00e3o. The worst of these famines, between 1877 and 1879, was said to have killed over half the region's population. In its natural state, the sert\u00e3o was covered by a distinctive scrubby caatinga vegetation, consisting generally of low thorny bushes adapted to the extreme climate. Several species of tree in the caatinga, such as the cashew, have become valuable horticultural plants. Most of the sert\u00e3o vegetation is now substantially degraded as a result of centuries of cattle ranching or clearing for cotton farming. Parts of the sert\u00e3o are recognized as a biodiversity hot- spot because of its unique flora.
