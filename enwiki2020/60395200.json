    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team represents the University of Cincinnati in the 2019\u201320 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Bearcats are led by first-year head-coach John Brannen. The team plays their home games at Fifth Third Arena as members of the American Athletic Conference. ==Previous season== The Bearcats finished the 2018\u201319 season 28\u20137, 14\u20134 in AAC play, finishing in second place. They defeated SMU, Wichita State, and No. 1 seed Houston to win the AAC Tournament for the second consecutive year, and received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. As the No. 7 seed in the South region, they were upset by No. 10 seed Iowa in the first round. After the conclusion of the NCAA Tournament, head coach Mick Cronin accepted the head-coaching position at UCLA. John Brannen, the head coach at nearby Northern Kentucky, would be hired to replace Cronin. In the transition, UC lost G/F Rashawn Fredericks and C Nysier Brooks - both of whom would've both been seniors. They also lost sophomore guard Logan Johnson and backup PF Eliel Nsoseme. Incoming freshman and Ohio's Mr. Basketball in 2019, Samari Curtis, also de-committed. Jarron Cumberland announced he would test the waters to enter the 2019 NBA draft on April 20, 2019. On May 27th, Cumberland announced he would return for his senior season. Despite the deluge of transfers, Brannen was able to inspire a late-season recruiting renaissance, as he moved quickly to land Jeremiah Davenport, Chris Vogt, Mika Adams-Woods, Chris McNeal, Jaume Sorolla, and Jaevin Cumberland (in that order) - with the latter four commitments transpiring in under one week's time. It is worth noting that, at the time of the final scholarship being fulfilled, both Logan Johnson and Eliel Nsoseme were still in the transfer protocol and technically \"could\" return to UC; this series of signings effectively locked in their transfer from the program. After all the dust settled, UC would have a final transfer enter the portal in redshirt Freshman LaQuill Hardnett. His spot would be filled shortly thereafter by the highest rated recruit of the 2019 class, Zach Harvey. Entering this season, new scholarship players would now outnumber returning players 7-6. == Offseason == === Departing players === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" ! Name !! Number !!
