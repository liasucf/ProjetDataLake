He is best known as leader/vocalist of the Galloping Coroners () rock band. == Personal ideology == From his childhood on he was very interested in dealing with the Sun and the cosmos. As an adult he is looking for the answer whether the Universe does have a physical, biological or psychological nature. == Life == === Ancestry === Grandpierre's family name comes from French Huguenot ancestors, according to family tradition, with some French bishops, of whom one, Louis Grandpierre, was a Swiss politician and president of the Swiss Appeal Court, and another, K\u00e1roly Grandpierre, a writer and consultantA photo of Lajos Kossuth dedicated to K\u00e1roly Grandpierre. wikimedia >> of Lajos Kossuth, settled in Hungary.

He graduated at ELTE as a physicist-astronomer in 1974, and got his Ph.D. in 1977. ==Physicist career== He studied theoretical biology focused on Ervin Bauer's works. In 2009 his subject field of interest concerned the relation between astronomy and civilization. During 1995-1998 he worked with Professor Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3 studying the physics of collective consciousness and the quantum-vacuum interactions.Grandpierre, A. 1995, Quantum-Vacuum Interactions in the Brain. in the Appendix of The Interconnected Universe. Toward a Unified Science of Quantum, Cosmos and Consciousness, by Ervin Laszlo, World Scientific, pp. 113-117 In 2011 he was an invited professor on Computational Biology at the Chapman University, California for six months. As physicist he had a strong interest in the problem of bringing the sciences and metaphysics together. He paid special attention to interdisciplinal scienceA. Grandpierre was the member of the Scientific Board of the International Consortium for Interdisciplinary Science in 2008. and complexity of living systems in 2008. === Books === As a physicist, Grandpierre published 10 books, 3 book chapters, more than 70 science and over 300 popular science papers. He wrote the Fundamental Complexity Measures of Life and Cosmic Life Forms chapters in the book titled From Fossils to Astrobiology (2008, Springer). He was co-editor of the book Astronomy and Civilization in the New Enlightenment (2011, Springer). === Important publications === In astrophysics he wrote an article on the variable nature of the Sun's core, which was mentioned in New Scientist in 2007. Working with Katalin Martin\u00e1s, he wrote on \"natural\" thermodynamics.Martinas, K. and Grandpierre, A. 2009, Natural Thermodynamics. Kopenhagen, June 22\u201324, 2009, Conceptual Thermodynamics, The Joint European Thermodynamics Conference, Copenhagen He formulated a mathematical principle of biology as published in NeuroQuantology in 2007. == Musician career == As a musician Atilla Grandpierre is best known as leader/vocalist of Galloping Coroners (V\u00e1gt\u00e1z\u00f3 Halottk\u00e9mek in Hungarian) rock band and later the same of acoustic Galloping Wonder Stag from 2005.
