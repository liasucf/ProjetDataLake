The World Rowing Championships in 1966, 1979, 1989, and 2011 were held at Lake Bled. ==Bled Island== The lake surrounds Bled Island (). The island has several buildings, the main one being the pilgrimage church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary (), built in its current form near the end of the 17th century, and decorated with remains of Gothic frescos from around 1470 in the presbyterium and rich Baroque equipment. The church has a tower and there is a Baroque stairway dating from 1655 with 99 stone steps leading up to the building. The church is frequently visited and weddings are held there regularly. Traditionally it is considered good luck for the groom to carry his bride up the steps on the day of their wedding before ringing the bell and making a wish inside the church. The traditional transportation to Bled Island is a wooden boat known as a pletna. The word pletna is a borrowing from Bavarian German Pl\u00e4tten 'flat-bottomed boat'. Some sources claim the pletna was used in Lake Bled as early as 1150 AD, but most historians date the first boats to 1590 AD. Similar in shape to Italian gondolas, a pletna seats 20 passengers. Modern boats are still made by hand and are recognizable by their colorful awnings. Pletna oarsman employ the stehrudder technique to propel and navigate boats across the lake using two oars. The role of the oarsman dates back to 1740, when Empress Maria Theresa granted 22 local families exclusive rights to ferry religious pilgrims across Lake Bled to worship on Bled Island. The profession is still restricted. Many modern oarsman descend directly from the original 22 families. == Gastronomy == The area's culinary specialty, a cream pastry (kremna rezina or krem\u0161nita 'Cremeschnitte'), was designated a protected dish of designated origin in 2016 by the Slovene government. Although various Slovene cream pastries date back to the Habsburg era, the current \"official\" recipe was created in 1953 by I\u0161tvan Luka\u010devi\u0107, the former manager of the Hotel Park's patisserie. There is an annual festival dedicated to the pastry. It is estimated that 12 million cream pastries have been prepared at the Hotel Park\u2019s patisserie over the last 60 years. ==See also== *Tourism in Slovenia ==References== ==External links== *Bled island website *Lake Bled Tourism Bled Bled Bled Category:Bled Category:Sava basin Category:Wetlands of Slovenia Category:Islands of Slovenia ",
