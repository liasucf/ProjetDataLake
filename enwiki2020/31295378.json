    "text": "Court is an unincorporated hamlet in Antelope Park Rural Municipality No. 322, Saskatchewan, Canada. The hamlet is approximately 50 km west of the Town of Kerrobert at the intersection of Highway 51 and Range road 282. The Canadian Pacific Railway played a big role in the towns economy when it was completed in 1914 in the early years of Court's history. Due to the closure of smaller branch lines in the 1980s the tracks from Kerrobert to Court were pulled and Court's population has since then declined. ==See also== * List of communities in Saskatchewan * Hamlets of Saskatchewan Category:Antelope Park No. 322, Saskatchewan Category:Unincorporated communities in Saskatchewan Category:Ghost towns in Saskatchewan Category:Division No. 13, Saskatchewan ",
