    "text": "The given name Erika, Erica, or Ericka, is a feminine form of Eric, deriving from the Old Norse name Eir\u00edkr (or Er\u00edkr in Eastern Scandinavia due to monophthongization). The first element, ei- is derived either from the older Proto-Norse *aina(z), meaning \"one, alone, unique\",Entries \"\u00c6ir\u00edk\u0280\", \"\u00c6i-\", in: Nordiskt runnamnslexikon (2002) by Lena Peterson at the Swedish Institute for Linguistics and Heritage (Institutet f\u00f6r spr\u00e5k och folkminnen).

The second element -r\u00edkr stems either from *r\u00edks \"king, ruler\" (cf.

The name is thus usually taken to mean \"sole ruler, monarch\" or \"eternal ruler, ever powerful\". It is a common name in many Western societies. It is also a popular given name for women in Japan (even though its origin has nothing in common with the Nordic roots of the Western version). Erica is also the name of a genus of approximately 860 species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, commonly known as \"heaths\" or \"heathers\" in English, and is the Latin word for \"heather\". == People with the name == *\u00c9rika Alcocer Luna (born 1974), Mexican singer, winner of the second generation of La Academia *Erika Alexander (born 1969), American actress *Erica Alfridi (born 1968), Italian race walker *Erika Araki (born 1984), Japanese national volleyball team captain *Erica Atkins-Campbell, (born 1972), American singer most famous from Mary Mary *Erica Bartolina (born 1980), American pole vaulter *Erica Blasberg (1984\u20132010), American professional golfer *Erica Bougard (born 1993), American heptathlete *Erika Buenfil (born 1963), Mexican actress *Erika von Brockdorff (1911\u20131943), German resistance fighter during the Second World War *Erika Christensen (born 1982), American actress *Erika Coimbra (born 1980), Brazilian volleyball player *Erica Cornejo, Argentine ballet dancer *Erika Cosby, American painter and daughter of Bill Cosby *Erika Costell (born 1993), American YouTuber, model, and singer *Erika Cremer (1900\u20131996), German physicist *Erica Durance (born 1978), Canadian actress *Erika Eleniak (born 1969), American actress and Playboy Playmate *Erika Ender (born 1974), Panamanian singer, songwriter and actress *Erika Fisch (born 1934), German athlete *Erika Fuchs (1906\u20132005), German translator *Erica Garner (1990-2017), American activist *Erika Gonz\u00e1lez (born 1972), Mexican freestyle swimmer *Erika Hansen (born 1970), American swimmer *Erika Hamden, US astrophysicist and Assistant Professor *Erika Henningsen (born 1992), American actor *Erika Heynatz (1975-), Australian model, actress, singer and television personality *Erica Jarder (born 1986), Swedish long jumper *Erica Hill (born 1976), American journalist *Erika Jayne, dance/electronica artist *Erica Johansson (born 1974), Swedish long jumper *Erica Jong (born 1942), American author *Erika Kaljusaar (born 1956), Estonian actress *Erika Kinsey (born 1988), Swedish high jumper *Erika Kirpu (born 1992), Estonian \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer *Erika Landin, actress and Big Brother contestant *Erika Liebman (1738\u20131803), Swedish poet *Erika deLone, (born 1972), retired American professional tennis player *Erica Lindbeck, American voice actress *Erica Luttrell (born 1982), Canadian voice actress *Erika Mann (1905\u20131969), German writer, the daughter of Thomas Mann *Erika Mann (politician) (born 1950), German politician *Erika Mar\u00edn- Spiotta, Spanish-born biogeochemist and ecosystem ecologist *Erika Mitchell is the real name of author E.
