    "text": "Reefer Madness, one of the earliest films to garner particularly negative contemporary reviews The films listed below have been cited by a variety of notable critics in varying media sources as being among the worst films ever made. Examples of such sources include Metacritic, Roger Ebert's list of most- hated films, The Golden Turkey Awards, Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, Rotten Tomatoes, the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the cult TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000, the cult webseries The Cinema Snob and the Golden Raspberry Awards (aka the \"Razzies\"). Films on these lists are generally feature-length films that are commercial/artistic in nature (intended to turn a profit, express personal statements or both), professionally or independently produced (as opposed to amateur productions), and released in theaters, then on television, or more recently through on-demand streaming services. == 1930s == === Maniac (1934) === Maniac, also known as Sex Maniac, is an exploitation/horror film directed by Dwain Esper. The story is a loose adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story \"The Black Cat\" and follows a vaudeville impersonator who becomes an assistant to a mad scientist. Promoted as a documentary on mental illness, Maniac was criticized for its gratuitous footage of women undressing and for taking horror sequences from the 1922 silent film H\u00e4xan. Danny Peary believes that Maniac is the worst film ever made, Charlie Jane Anders of Gawker Medias io9 described it as \"possibly the worst movie in history\" and Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington wrote that it may be the worst film he had ever seen, writing: \"There are some voyages into ineptitude, like Dwain Esper's anti-classic Maniac, that defy all reason.\" Rotten Tomatoes placed Maniac on their list of movies \"So Bad They're Unmissable\", the Italian Vanity Fair included the film on its list of the 20 worst movies ever, and it is featured in The Official Razzie Movie Guide. === Reefer Madness (1936) === Originally titled Tell Your Children, Reefer Madness was called \"the grand-daddy of all 'Worst' movies\" by Leonard Maltin Reefer Madness (originally released as Tell Your Children and sometimes titled or subtitled as The Burning Question, Dope Addict, Doped Youth, and Love Madness) is a 1936 American exploitation film and propaganda work revolving around the melodramatic events that ensue when high school students are lured by pushers to try marijuana\u2014from a hit and run accident, to manslaughter, suicide, attempted rape, and descent into madness. Pacific Standard wrote that Reefer Madness was \"one of the first films ever to be considered transcendentally bad\" and Leonard Maltin has called it \"the grand-daddy of all 'Worst' movies\". Las Vegas CityLife named it the \"worst ever\" runner-up to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and News.com.au considered it a \"disastrous flop turned cult classic\" due to its \"terrible acting and exaggerated drug-addicted stereotypes\". The film has inspired a number of parodies, including an off-Broadway musical satire and a 2005 film based on the musical.Reefer Madness (2005)-Overview- TCM.com === The Terror of Tiny Town (1938) === The Terror of Tiny Town, directed by Sam Newfield and produced by Jed Buell, remains the only musical Western with an all-dwarf cast. The film was pulled from obscurity as a camp classic after appearing in college and midnight screenings in the early 1970s.The Terror of Tiny Town (1938) - Articles - TCM.com In 1978, it was included in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time and has since been listed as one of the worst films ever made by Flavorwire, Rotten Tomatoes, and The Golden Turkey Awards. Melvin Defleur referred to it as \"Perhaps the worst film of all time\", and critic Gabriel Ricard listed it as the worst film ever made; stating,\"not only is it pretty terrible, but Tiny Town is also pretty endearing.\" In 1986, The Terror of Tiny Town was the first film featured on Canned Film Festival, a late night television show featuring the worst movies ever made. == 1940s == === No Orchids for Miss Blandish (1948) === No Orchids for Miss Blandish, a British gangster film adapted from the 1939 novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film's high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James) was seen as unconvincing. The British film journal Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen\". The Sunday Express film reviewer called No Orchids for Miss Blandish \"the worst film I have ever seen\". The Australian newspaper The Age also gave a harsh review: \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole ... the entire production is unpardonable.\" Cliff Goodwin, discussing No Orchids For Miss Blandish's initial reception, notes it was \"unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made. Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. No Orchids for Miss Blandish was described by British film reviewer Leslie Halliwell as a \"hilariously awful gangster film ... one of the worst films ever made\". Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide states that No Orchids for Miss Blandish \"aspires to be a Hollywood film noir and misses by a mile.\" === The Babe Ruth Story (1948) === The Babe Ruth Story is a 1948 baseball film biography of Babe Ruth, starring William Bendix, Claire Trevor and Sam Levene. The New York Times describes it as \"the Plan 9 from Outer Space of baseball biopics\". It was rushed into release while Ruth was still alive. In the final scene, Ruth delivers on a promise he made to a young cancer patient that he would hit a home run. Not only does Ruth succeed in fulfilling the promise, but also the child is subsequently cured of his cancer. Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe claimed the film was the worst he had ever seen, while The Washington Times stated that it \"stands as possibly the worst movie ever made\". The film has been called one of the worst sports films ever by Newsday and The A.V. Club, and called one of the worst biopics by Moviefone and Spike. Michael Sauter included it in his book The Worst Movies of All Time and Leonard Maltin called it \"perfectly dreadful\". == 1950s == === Glen or Glenda (1953) === Ed Wood appears in a scene from Glen or Glenda. He directed Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space and was named the Worst Director of All Time in The Golden Turkey Awards. A semi- autobiographical quasi-documentary about transvestism, Glen or Glenda starred and was directed by Ed Wood. After a nightmarish dream sequence, Glen undergoes psychotherapy to help cure his affliction. Bela Lugosi appears in this film, as he did in several other Wood films toward the end of his career. Leonard Maltin insists this was far worse than Wood's later Plan 9 from Outer Space and considers it \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Richard Barrios describes Glen or Glenda as \"one of the funniest and worst movies ever made\".Richard Barrios, Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall, Psychology Press, 2003, , Page 235. In his book Cult Movies 3, Danny Peary suggests this is actually a radical, if ineptly made, film that presents a far more personal story than is contained in films by more well- respected auteurs, and it was taken seriously and seen as a significant work by Steve Jenkins, writing for The Monthly Film Bulletin when the film was finally released in the UK in 1981. In 1994, Tim Burton directed Ed Wood, which includes some material about the trials and tribulations of making Glen or Glenda. === Robot Monster (1953) === Robot Monster, a science-fiction film originally shot and exhibited in 3D, features an actor dressed in a gorilla suit and what looks almost like a diving helmet. The film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, is listed in Michael Sauter's book The Worst Movies of All Time among \"The Baddest of the Bs\". It is also featured in The Book of Lists 10 worst movies list, and in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. The Golden Turkey Awards confers on its main character the title of \"Most Ridiculous Monster in Screen History\" and, listing director Tucker among the runners-up to \"Worst Director of All Time\" (the winner being Ed Wood), states, \"What made Robot Monster ineffably worse than any other low-budget sci-fi epic was its bizarre artistic pretension\". It was featured in an episode of the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000, and was fondly remembered by author Stephen King, who quotes, and agrees with, a review in Castle of Frankenstein magazine (\"certainly among the finest terrible movies ever made\", \"one of the most laughable poverty row quickies\"). === The Conqueror (1956) === Howard Hughes funded The Conqueror, an epic film featuring John Wayne as Mongolian chieftain Genghis Khan and the redheaded Susan Hayward as a Tatar princess. The movie was filmed near St. George, Utah, downwind from a nuclear testing range in Nevada, and is often blamed for the cancer deaths of many of the cast and crew, including Hayward, Wayne, Agnes Moorehead, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, and director Dick Powell. In addition to filming near the testing range, truckloads of the red sands were transported back to the studios for interior scenes. The film made the ten-worst list in The Book of Lists, appears in Michael Sauter's book The Worst Movies of All Time, and was among those listed in Michael Medved's book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Originally written for Marlon Brando, The Guardian called the choice of Wayne for Khan \"one of the worst casting decisions of all time\". Complex listed The Conqueror as the worst biopic ever made. Hughes, one of the world's wealthiest people at the time, had previously produced the successful dramatic films Hell's Angels, Scarface, and The Outlaw. After seeing The Conqueror himself, Hughes bought every existing print for $12 million and refused to let the film be seen on television until 1974, reportedly out of guilt over the decision to shoot at such a hazardous location. By 1980, 91 of the 220 cast and crew members had been diagnosed with cancer, over 41%. This was the last film Hughes produced. === Fire Maidens from Outer Space (1956) === Fire Maidens from Outer Space, a low-budget British space opera film (known in the US as Fire Maidens of Outer Space), is about a group of astronauts visiting an all-female society on a moon of Jupiter. This film developed a negative reputation for its poor special effects (including a scene on the alien planet in which an automobile is visible driving past).Fire Maidens Of Outer Space. DVD Talk, August 13, 2013. Retrieved January 21, 2014. Leslie Halliwell described Fire Maidens from Outer Space as \"a strong contender for the title of the worst movie ever made, with diaphanously clad English gals striking embarrassed poses against cardboard sets\".John Walker (ed.) Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000, London and New York; HarperCollins, 1999, (p.287). British film historian I.Q. Hunter included it in his list of candidates for \"the worst British film ever made\".I. Q Hunter, \"From Window Cleaner to Potato Man\" in British Comedy Cinema, edited by I.Q. Hunter and Laraine Porter. Routledge, 2012. . (p.154) The DVD Talk website's review claimed it \"may be among the worst-ever professionally produced science fiction films\". In November 1992, the film was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. === Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) === Plan 9 from Outer Space has been named the worst movie ever made by The Golden Turkey Awards and other sources Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space was labeled the \"Worst Film Ever\" by The Golden Turkey Awards. This movie marked the final film appearance of Bela Lugosi. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by Tom Mason, the chiropractor of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face. Wood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died. Worst of all, Mason couldn't do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and kitschy dialogue. And Wood's characteristically cavalier attitude toward continuity night suddenly changing to day, automobile models suddenly changing makes the film difficult to follow. Shot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor. It has played at the New Orleans Worst Film Festival. In 1994, Tim Burton directed Ed Wood, which includes some material about the trials and tribulations of making Plan 9. Phil Hall of Film Threat calls it \"far too entertaining to be considered as the very worst film ever made\". Likewise, John Wirt of The Advocate goes as far as to call it \"the ultimate cult flick\", and Videohound's Complete Guide to Cult Flicks and Trash Pics states, \"In fact, the film has become so famous for its own badness that it's now beyond criticism.\" Ian Berriman of SFX commented about the unintentional comedy, \"Some things are best watched at 3 am, wrapped in the warm glow of drunkenness ... Plan 9 From Outer Space is one of them.\" The Radio Times Guide to Films described Plan 9 as \"the worst film ever made\" and \"tediously depressing\".Radio Times Guide to Films 2014. Radio Times, London, 2013. (p.947). == 1960s == === The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961) === The Beast of Yucca Flats by Coleman Francis, shot silently with added narration, concerns a scientist (Tor Johnson) who is exposed to radiation from an atomic blast, which turns him into a monster. The film opens with a scene of implied necrophilia that has nothing to do with the remainder of the movie and does not fit anywhere into the film's chronology. Leonard Maltin's TV and Movie Guide calls it \"one of the worst films ever made\". Bill Warren said, \"It may very well be the worst non-porno science fiction movie ever made.\" It was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where members of the cast state it is one of the worst films they have seen up to that point. === Eegah (1962) === The low-budget shocker Eegah features Richard Kiel as a prehistoric caveman emerging in early 1960s California who clumsily finds love with a teenage girl. Arch Hall Jr. performs musical numbers, with lyrics widely considered terrible. The film's notoriety was enhanced as a result of being featured on episodes of Canned Film Festival and Mystery Science Theater 3000, where the cast of the show stated in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide (), that they consider the shaving scene (where Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream) one of the most disgusting things they have seen. It was also one of the films listed in Michael Medved's book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. === The Creeping Terror (1964) === The science-fiction/horror film The Creeping Terror was directed, produced, and edited by Vic Savage (under the pseudonym A.J. Nelson, but he keeps his name when credited as an actor). The movie is about a large slug-like alien that lands on Earth and terrorizes a small town in California.Medved, Harry and Michael (1986). Son of Golden Turkey Awards. New York: Random House/Villard Books. . p. 197. The film is memorable for its use of some bargain-basement effects: stock footage of a rocket launch played in reverse to depict the landing of an alien spacecraft, and the \"monster\" appears to be composed of a length of shag carpet draped over several actors. Notably, the creature's victims inexplicably stand perfectly still as the slow-moving monster approaches them. Scott Weinberg of efilmcritic.com simply summarizes the movie with \"You've seen clips of this one in those 'awful, awful movies' documentaries.\" The movie was featured in the sixth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000. === Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964) === Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is the only film to be featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, Canned Film Festival and Cinematic Titanic The sci-fi movie Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was the creation of Nicholas Webster.SANTA CONQUERS THE MARTIANS (Nicholas Webster, 1964) on Vimeo Because Martian children only get to see Santa Claus on TV signals beamed from Earth, their parents decide to abduct Santa to make them happy. The film was criticized for its oddity and poor special effects. It is also known for starring a very young Pia Zadora. BBC critic Nick Cramp described it as \"possibly the worst film ever made\". The film is cited on a 10-worst list in The Book of Lists and in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. It has been featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000, Canned Film Festival and Cinematic Titanic (a spin-off of MST3K) revisited the film in 2008. === The Horror of Party Beach (1964) === Mystery Science Theater 3000 featured The Horror of Party Beach in 1997, and the film was listed in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Del Tenney directed it, and the plot mainly consists of sea monsters attacking young women at slumber parties on an East Coast beach, who keep returning even after a few murders. The New York Times film review stated, \"The most to be said for him is that he has not stinted on the gore.\"New York Times Movie Review April 30, 1964 Thomas Lisanti in Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959\u20131969 called it \"by far the worst of the sixties beach films\", and Stephen King called it \"an abysmal little wet fart of a film\".Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959\u20131969 By Thomas Lisanti, number 8 Joe Meyers in the Hearst newspaper blog for the Stamford Advocate said on Del Tenney's passing: \"Connecticut had its own Ed Wood, an actor, director and entrepreneur named Del Tenney who made a series of truly awful pictures in the Stamford area during the 1960s, the most notorious of which is Horror of Party Beach, a 1964 drive-in quickie about an atomic mutation that terrorizes Stamford ('Party Beach' was actually Shippan Point).\" It is also listed in Michael Sauter's book The Worst Movies of All Time.The worst movies of all time, or, What were they thinking? Michael Sauter; Carol Pub. Group, 1999 358 pages, page 306 === The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (1964) === The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (sometimes billed as The Incredibly Strange Creatures) is a 1964 American monster movie written and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym \"Cash Flagg\". In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble into a group of occultists and disfigured monsters. Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn's Coney Island. The film was billed as the first \"monster musical\", beating out The Horror of Party Beach by a mere month in release date. The 2004 DVD The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made listed this film as the worst film of all time. The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about Incredibly Strange Creatures in which he tries to explain and justify the movie's value: \"This flick doesn't just rebel against, or even disregard, standards of taste and art. In the universe inhabited by The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, such things as standards and responsibility have never been heard of. It is this lunar purity which largely imparts to the film its classic stature. Like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and a very few others, it will remain as an artifact in years to come to which scholars and searchers for truth can turn and say, This was trash! === Monster a Go-Go! (1965) === Monster a Go-Go! began as Terror at Halfday by Bill Rebane. The production ran out of money and the film was abandoned. Herschell Gordon Lewis, who reportedly needed a second feature to comprise a double bill, purchased and completed it for a minimal amount of money. Several of the film's actors were unable to return, so Lewis simply replaced their parts with new characters who mysteriously appear and fill the roles of the missing characters. One of the actors Lewis managed to rehire had gained weight, gone bald, and grown a goatee, so Lewis recast him as the brother of the original character. The picture consists mostly of lengthy dialogue sequences concerning the apparent mutation of an astronaut into a monster portrayed by the giant Henry Hite. Poor audio quality makes much of the dialogue unintelligible, and when the film is overexposed, several characters' faces appear as bright white, glowing circles. During the climax of the movie, as soldiers prepare to confront the mutated astronaut, he abruptly vanishes and the narrator informs the audience, \"there was no monster\", and that the astronaut has, in fact, been in the Atlantic Ocean the entire time. All Movie Guide calls the film a \"surreal anti-masterpiece\". It was also featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where writer Paul Chaplin called the dialogue \"garbled beyond recognition\". The entire cast of the show later stated it was officially the worst movie they have ever seen. === Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966) === Manos: The Hands of Fate was Mystery Science Theater 3000 most popular episode. The low-budget horror film Manos: The Hands of Fate, made by El Paso insurance and fertilizer salesman Hal P. Warren, concerns a vacationing family kidnapped by a polygamous cult of pagans. The film was conceived after Warren bet Academy Award-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant that anyone could make a horror movie. Warren was convinced by the film's cinematographer and stunt coordinator that most of its glaring mistakes could be fixed in a Dallas post-production studio, when in reality the two wanted to quickly wrap the production because they were not being paid. Several technical gaffes made it into the film, including scenes filmed out of focus, a marking slate being seen in one shot, the scarf on the female lead's head disappearing and reappearing, and an insect bumping the camera lens. The film was shot with a camera that could not record sound and had a 32-second maximum shot length. All dialogue was later dubbed by Warren and four others, including a grown woman who dubbed the voice for a seven- year-old girl. It opens with a nine-minute driving scene that the filmmakers intended to use for cast and crew credits, but failed to do so. The movie includes dialogue spoken while all characters are facing away from the camera, a character complaining about it getting dark while the sun is brightly shining, and the character Torgo, a satyr with overly large thighs, that three women attempt to massage to death. The film gained notoriety and cult popularity by being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and was the show's most popular episode. The film has a 7% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Entertainment Weekly says the movie is \"widely regarded as, quite simply, the worst movie ever made\". Even Warren himself would later admit his film was one of the worst ever, suggesting it might make a passable comedy if redubbed. The film was later restored'Manos: The Hands of Fate': Carefully Restoring The Opposite Of A Masterpiece : NPR and released on Blu-ray in 2015.Read this: The battle over the infamous cult classic Manos: The Hands of Fate|AV ClubSynapse Films === A Place for Lovers (1968) === A Place for Lovers is a French-Italian romantic film directed by Vittorio De Sica (a filmmaker known for acclaimed neorealist works such as Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves), starring Faye Dunaway as a terminally ill American fashion designer in Venice, Italy, and Marcello Mastroianni as a race car driver who has a whirlwind affair with her. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it the \"most godawful piece of pseudo-romantic slop I've ever seen!\" and Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times referred to it as \"the worst movie I have seen all year and possibly since 1926\". Leonard Maltin noted Ebert's comments in his review and offered that the film was \"low points for all concerned\". A Place for Lovers was included as one of the choices in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time and the Italian Vanity Fair listed it as one of the 20 worst movies ever made. === They Saved Hitler's Brain (1968) === They Saved Hitler's Brain is a science fiction film directed by David Bradley.They Saved Hitler's Brain (1964) - TCM.com It was adapted for television from a shorter 1963 theatrical feature film, Madmen of Mandoras,The Madmen of Mandoras (1963) - IMDb and was lengthened by about 20 minutes with additional footage shot by UCLA students at the request of the distributor. In the film, Adolf Hitler's head was severed from his body at the end of World War II and the head plans to rule over a new Third Reich from South America. It has a rare rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 1.3/10. TV Guide called it \"One of the all-time worst\", while Danny Peary said it was \"A legitimate candidate for Worst Film Ever Made title.\" In 1979, it won the World's Worst Film Festival in Ottawa, Canada, which reportedly delighted Bradley. It has been featured in The Golden Turkey Awards, Canned Film Festival, and has been spoofed on The Simpsons multiple times. == 1970s == === Myra Breckinridge (1970) === The LBGT comedy Myra Breckinridge, based on the book of the same name by Gore Vidal,Gore Vidal: The United States of Amnesia - Clip \"Myra Breckenridge\" | HD | IFC Films on YouTube directed by Michael SarneMyra Breckinridge \u2014 Variety and starring Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Mae West, John Huston and Farrah Fawcett, provoked controversy due to a scene in which Welch forcibly sodomizes a bound man while clips from various classic films play onscreen. The film was initially rated X before edits and an appeal to the MPAA brought it down to an R. It also used the technique of inserting clips from Golden Age movies in such a way that the dialogue took on sexual undertones. Several stars whose films were featured objected to the gimmick such as Loretta Young who sued to remove the footage from the 1939 film The Story of Alexander Graham Bell.Myra Breckinridge - TCM.com The film was a critical failure, with Time magazine saying \"Myra Breckinridge is about as funny as a child molester\". Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB (the lowest score possible) and stated that it was \"as bad as any movie ever made\". The Miami News critic Herb Kelly nominated Myra Breckinridge as the worst film ever made. The film is also cited in The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. It also was included in The Book of Lists worst movies of all time, claiming there was something in the movie to offend absolutely everyone. Gore Vidal disowned it, calling it \"an awful joke\", and blamed the movie for a decade-long drought in the sale of the original book. === Zaat (1971) === Directed by Don Barton, Zaat was also known under various titles including Hydra, Attack of the Swamp Creatures, Legend of the Zaat Monster, and The Blood Waters of Dr. Z (the name under which it was lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000). The film follows a Nazi mad scientist who injects himself with a formula that turns him into a mutated catfish. Florida Times-Union critic Matt Soergel quipped that Zaat \"could very well be the best film ever made about a mutated catfish\". Critic Jeffrey Kauffman said, \"this is the sort of film Ed Wood, Jr. might have made\u2014on a bad day\" and added, \"Lovers of fantastically bad films rate Zaat one of the worst\". Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, \"The acting in Zaat is below subpar. Actors seem to be whispering their lines and trying hard not to fully comprehend that they're in one of the worst films ever made\", while Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict also claimed, \"Zaat may be one of the worst films ever created\". NPR called it a \"sci-fi fiasco\" when it became \"the winner \u2014 er, loser \u2014\" on IMDb's Bottom 100. Zaat appeared on Mystery Science Theater 3000, which gave it significant exposure, and was also featured on RedLetterMedia's show Half in the Bag where the hosts called it one of their favorite \"so bad it's good\" films. Total Film included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. === An American Hippie in Israel (1972) === The Israeli film An American Hippie in Israel is about an American hippie traveling to Israel after being involved with the Vietnam War, befriending Israeli flower children, and encountering \"menacing\" mimes along the way. The film was presumed lost, but after resurfacing 38 years after its production, it became a \"midnight sensation\" in Tel Aviv and developed a cult followingAn American Hippie in Israel posted by Cork Film Festival on Vimeo akin to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was then released internationally on home video by Grindhouse Releasing. Gil Shefler of The Jewish Daily Forward described it as \"perfectly awful\", offering that it \"probably is the worst Israeli movie ever made, and a serious candidate for the worst movie of all time\". Ben Hartman of The Jerusalem Post stated the film was \"surely one of the worst films ever made in Israel, or beyond\". Nana 10 said it claims the title of \"worst Israeli film and most amusing\". News article from Nana 10 (Last accessed August 26, 2013). === Bat Pussy (unknown, possibly 1973) === A loose spoof of the 1966 Batman television series cited as one of the earliest examples of a pornographic parody film, the presumably-1970s pornographic film Bat Pussy has been \"widely described\" as the worst pornographic film ever made, on account of \"some incredibly unarousing sex and a general attitude of awfulness\". Possessing no credits or copyright information, there is no known record of Bat Pussys existence prior to the mid-1990s, when it was discovered in the storeroom of an adult movie theater in Memphis, Tennessee, and subsequently released on home video by exploitation film distributor Something Weird Video. Gawker Medias io9 proclaimed the film to be \"the absolute nadir of pornography, period. Not just Batman-themed pornography. ALL pornography\", deriding its \"obese redneck\" cast as rendering the film \"wank-proof\". PornParody.com, a website dedicated to pornographic parody films, acknowledged its status as \"the worst adult movie of all time\", describing Bat Pussy as \"renowned for its technical ineptness and anti-eroticism\" due to its \"physically unappealing\" actors. AV Maniacs contested Bat Pussys categorization as pornography on the grounds of the lead actor's visible impotence and instead labeled the film \"anti-porn\", asking \"How else do you categorize an adult film that completely and utterly fails to elicit even the minutest amount of arousal in its viewers?\" The book The Many More Lives of Batman by William Uricchio and Will Brooker also labeled Bat Pussy \"the worst porn film ever made\", criticizing its poor adaptation of the source material, while Tim Lewis, the general manager of Something Weird Video, selected Bat Pussy as the one film \"so nuts it has to be seen to be believed\" out of the company's entire catalog, saying it was \"only for the truly jaded adult film viewer\". === Karvat (The Hair) (1974) === The Hair is a Finnish erotic black comedy film from 1974, written and directed by Seppo Huunonen. It was loosely based on Lionel White\u2019s 1962 suspense novel Obsession,Lionel White: Novels, and a List of Books by Author like Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s 1965 French film Pierrot le Fou. The Hair tells the story of a middle-aged man who becomes deeply involved with the affairs and criminal connections of a mysterious girl. Critics were scathing about the film. Eeva J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 from Helsingin Sanomat summed up her assessment: \u201cThe Hair is trying to offer sex and humor, a show and momentum, violence and drama. In all of this, it fails miserably.\u201dKarvat (1974) \u2013 Elonet (in Finnish) Timo Malmi from Ilta-Sanomat considers the film to be one of the \"worst Finnish films ever\" and in his assessment calls the film's \u201cplot so confusing and tense that its progression is not even interesting, and the \"alternative\" fantasy ending does not make the viewing experience any easier.\u201dIllalla tv:ss\u00e4: Onko t\u00e4m\u00e4 kaikkien aikojen huonoin suomalainen elokuva? \u201dRyvet\u00e4\u00e4n pohjamudissa\u201d (in Finnish) In connection with the 2011 DVD release, Janne Rosenqvist from Film-o-Holic site found something positive in the film as well: \u201cAt its best, The Hair offers smooth physical black comedy spiced with jazz, but the outright obsession with experimentation is too much of a burden.\u201dRosenqvist, Janne: Kolmen ep\u00e4tasainen kopla miehen maailmasta, Film-o-Holic 19.8.2011. (in Finnish) === At Long Last Love (theatrical version, 1975) === Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich initially apologized for At Long Last Love, once described as \"the worst musical extravaganza in Hollywood history\", but an updated cut of the film has been met with critical reevaluation At Long Last Love was renowned director Peter Bogdanovich's musical homage to great 1930s Hollywood musicals. It features songs by Cole Porter and stars Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds. Upon release, it received very negative reviews. CNN noted it was once considered \"the worst musical extravaganza in Hollywood history\". Esquire film critic John Simon said, \"it may be the worst movie musical of this \u2013 or any \u2013 decade\". Buffalo News film critic Jeff Simon wrote, \"About 45 minutes in, it became apparent to one and all that this was one of the worst and most embarrassing major-talent turkeys of all time.\" Film critic Jay Cocks has said the film was \"regarded as the great white elephant catastrophe of its time\". Hollis Alpert stated, \"This failure is so dismal that it goes beyond failure.\" It was included in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time and Michael Sauter's book The Worst Films of All Time. It is also included in the Golden Turkey Awards Nominees and Winners, the Worst Achievements in Hollywood History. Bogdanovich, who was also the screenwriter, sent press releases to newspapers across the country apologizing for this film. One defender of the film was Roger Ebert, who stated, \"The movie's no masterpiece, but I can't account for the viciousness of some of the critical attacks against it.\" He continued, \"It's a light, silly, impeccably stylish entertainment ... if [Bogdanovich] doesn't go spectacularly right, at least he provides small pleasures and great music.\" In a recent documentary on his career, Bogdanovich lamented being influenced by studio previews to cut the film before its theatrical release. He subsequently recut it again before it debuted on cable TV the next year. A fan of the film, a studio editor who preferred the director's first cut, secretly saved that original version and quietly put it in place of the others. When news of this version streaming on Netflix reached Bogdanovich, he contacted Fox and made a few finishing touches, resulting in a critically acclaimed director's cut that debuted on home video in 2013. === HaMal'ach Haya Satan (The Angel Was a Devil) (1976) === The Angel Was a Devil (filmed in 1971, released in 1976) is an Israeli horror film about a young woman fleeing a murderer that has been described by Meir Schnitzer, a leading authority on Israeli cinema and by others, as \"the worst film ever made in Israel.\" Moshe Guez was the film director, scriptwriter, star, cinematographer, recorder, editor and the composer of some of its original music.Moshe Guez-MUBI Due to the high concentration of crew positions, the production missed out on the subsidy for full-length Israeli movies that is almost automatically given to local productions. The production and distribution were plagued by many additional problems, including impacts of the Yom Kippur War, script and actor changes, and the instant bankruptcy of its final distributor. In 2011, Avida Livny released the documentary Looking for Moshe Guez, describing the film and a search after its director in Israel and the US. The creator released a slightly improved digital version of his movie in 2016. === Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977) === Exorcist II: The Heretic is the sequel to William Friedkin's Oscar-winning 1973 film, directed by John Boorman. While British film critic Mark Kermode called the original film his favourite film of all time, he believes the sequel to be the worst film ever made. The Golden Turkey Awards named it the second-worst film ever made, after Plan 9 from Outer Space. Critic Bill Chambers stated it was \"Possibly the worst film ever made and surely the worst sequel ever made.\" It also appeared in The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst book. Friedkin believes the sequel diminished the value of the original film and called it \"the worst piece of shit I've ever seen\" and \"a fucking disgrace.\" Eventually, the film garnered so much hate that Boorman disowned it. In an interview with Bob McCabe for the book The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows, he confessed, \"The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror.\"John Boorman, cited in Bob McCabe, The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.164 === The Swarm (1978) === The Swarm is a horror film about a killer bee invasion of Texas, directed and produced by Irwin Allen. Despite its all-star cast (including Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Olivia de Havilland), it was a box- office failure and was excoriated by reviewers.Halliwell's film and video guide 2002 edited by John Walker. London. HarperCollins Entertainment, 2001. (p. 804). On its UK release, The Sunday Times described The Swarm as \"simply the worst film ever made\".The worst movie ever? The Guardian, 26 April 2001. Retrieved 29 March 2014. Leslie Halliwell described it as a \"very obvious disaster movie with risible dialogue\". The Guardian article on The Swarm stated, \"You could pass it all off as a sick joke, except it cost twelve million dollars, twenty-two million bees, and several years of someone's life.\" Barry Took, reviewing it for Punch, stated, \"the story is of a banality matched only by the woodenness of the acting\". Time Out magazine called The Swarm a \"risibly inadequate disaster movie\".\"The Swarm\" Retrieved 29 March 2014. The Swarm is included in several \"worst movie\" books, including the Medved brothers' The Golden Turkey Awards,Mikel J. Koven, Film, Folklore and Urban Legends. Scarecrow Press, 2008 (p. 91) and John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide, as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. It soon gained a cult status (enough so that Warner Archive released the extended version on Blu-ray).Warner Archive Releasing Extended Version of 1978\u2019s \u2018The Swarm\u2019 on Blu-ray-Bloody DisgustingOn This Day in Horror History: The Mind Boggling \u2018The Swarm\u2019 Hit Theaters-Addicted to Horror === I Spit on Your Grave (1978) === I Spit on Your Grave became controversial for its graphic violence and lengthy depictions of gang rape. It was initially unable to find a distributor until 1980, when it received a wider release. Luke Y. Thompson of the New Times stated, \"Defenders of the film have argued that it's actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there's always one left standing\". Critic David Keyes named it the worst film of the 1980s. Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club called it \"one of the era's most abhorrent pieces of exploitation trash\" and Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, \"It's one of the most soulless, vile, and morally reprehensible things I've ever had to sit through.\" Roger Ebert gave the film no stars, referring to it as \"A vile bag of garbage ... without a shred of artistic distinction,\" adding, \"Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of, my life.\" Ebert also included it on his \"most hated\" list and considered it the worst movie ever made. Gene Siskel also considered it one of the worst films ever made. Author James Livingston wrote in The World Turned Inside Out that I Spit on Your Grave was \"a terrifically bad movie\", Film Racket featured it as their first entry in to their \"Worst Movie Ever?\" series, and Flavorwire named it the eleventh worst movie ever made. Despite the intense negative reception from some critics, the film has a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics arguing that \"It shows us the raw, shocking reality of rape, in all its bloody viciousness.\" === Caligula (1979) === Teresa Ann Savoy and Malcolm McDowell appear in Caligula, which was panned for its explicit sex scenes The erotic/historical drama Caligula, directed by Tinto Brass, about the infamous Roman Emperor was in part financed by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione. The film, featuring a prestigious cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud) is notable for its explicit scenes of sex and violence, including six minutes of hardcore porn footage filmed by Guccione and another editor. Caligula earned some prerelease controversy after Gore Vidal, who had written the script, distanced himself from the film. When Caligula was released, it received strongly hostile reviews, reviewers criticizing its extreme scenes of sex and violence and lack of narrative coherence. Rex Reed of New York magazine called the film a \"trough of rotten swill\". Roger Ebert gave Caligula a zero stars rating, dubbing it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\", accusing it of being artistically vulgar in its depiction of sex and violence, and of having technically incompetent direction and structure. Caligula was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out on (two hours into its 170-minute running time), after describing himself as feeling \"disgusted and unspeakably depressed\", and he also placed it on his \"Most Hated\" list. Jay Scott, reviewing Caligula for The Globe and Mail, stated, \"Caligula doesn't really work on any level\" and the film and its production \"constitute a boondoggle of landmark proportions\".Jay Scott, The Globe and Mail, February 7, 1980. So negative was its initial reception, Australian newspaper The Age stated that Caligula was being \"billed by critics everywhere as one of the worst films ever made\". Leslie Halliwell dubbed it \"a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sadomasochists\".Photoplay Magazine, Volume 38, 1987 (p. 38) The Hamilton Spectator later referred to Caligula as \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Joe Holleman, in an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch discussing historical films set in Ancient Rome, argued, \"two of the worst movies made in the 20th century were ancient Rome pieces ... Cleopatra and Caligula\". Christopher Armstead, reviewing Caligula for the website Film Critics United, stated, \"Dollar for dollar, this could very well be the worst movie ever made.\" == 1980s == === Heaven's Gate (theatrical version, 1980) === Heaven's Gate destroyed the reputation of director Michael Cimino and bankrupted film distributor United Artists, though re-edits of the film have been met with critical reevaluation. The Western epic Heaven's Gate, loosely based on the Johnson County War in 1890s Wyoming, was plagued by massive cost and time overruns, largely due to director Michael Cimino's extreme attention to detail. He demanded 50 takes of at least one scene, and refused to start shooting for another until a cloud he liked rolled across the sky. It cost over $44 million, but brought in only $3.5 million at the box office. The original version ran at nearly four hours, but was yanked from release after only one week due to scathing reviews. It later resurfaced in a 149-minute version, but by then the damage was done. Vincent Canby called it \"an unqualified disaster\", among other things. Roger Ebert called it \"the most scandalous cinematic waste I've ever seen\". After word of his grandiose spending and defiant nature toward studio United Artists got out (detailed in Final Cut by Steven Bach, a studio executive involved with the film from the beginning). Cimino was awarded the 1980 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film was nominated for four more Razzies, including Worst Picture. In 1999, Time placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century. In February 2010, the readers of Empire voted it the sixth-worst film of all time. That same year, Joe Queenan of The Guardian also called it the worst film ever made, saying that it \"defies belief\". Cimino was initially considered a director on the rise after directing The Deer Hunter (which won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director), but his reputation never recovered after Heaven's Gate. The production is also notorious for the cruelty to animals that occurred both on screen and on site, including deliberately killing a horse with explosives. The film effectively ended not only the existence of United Artists as an independent Hollywood studio (its parent firm sold the company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where it still operates), but also, largely, Cimino's career \u2014 he would not direct again until 1985's Year of the Dragon. Despite the vicious reviews, the film's reputation improved over time. In fall 2012, the New York Film Festival, the venue for its infamous opening, premiered the restored director's cut. In stark contrast, The Times (London) called the restored version \"a modern masterpiece\" and its 1980 cut \"one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history\". The film has also been released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that the film \"has been called a disaster and a disgrace, yet also anointed a masterpiece.\" === The Apple (1980) === The Apple (also called Star Rock) is a 1980 science fiction musical comedy film written and directed by Menahem Golan. It stars Catherine Mary Stewart as a young singer named Bibi, who, in a futuristic 1994, signs to an evil label named Boogalow International Music. It deals with themes of conformity versus rebellion, and makes use of Biblical allegoryBailey, Jason (10 July 2017). \"Bad Movie Night: The Distinctive Disco Cheese of \u2018The Apple\u2019\".

Common criticism from both reviews that appeared in trade publications and major news outlets and the audience were a lack of originality, a weak script, uninspired music, poor execution, and Golan's inexperienced take on the 1960s hippie movement. At the 1980 Montreal World Film Festival, some watchers threw vinyl records of music from the film at the screen.Harris p. 2 The Apple was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1980 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. The ballot was revised and re-released in 2006, where the Worst Picture results remained the same. In addition, the film received six more nominations, two of which were wins: Worst Director (Golan) and Least \u201cSpecial\u201d Special Effects. Sean Burns in the Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a scathing review: \"The Apple isn't just the worst disco musical ever made; it could very well be the worst movie ever made, period.\" In 2004, after a poor transfer on VHS that lead to years of fans rediscovering it a la midnight screenings at sci-fi conventions while also becoming a staple at film festivals and art houses, the cult film was finally released on DVD.'American Idol' Executive Producer's Secret Flop: 'The Apple' - MTV === Inchon (1981) === The war film Inchon, directed by Terence Young and starring Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur,Inchon (1982)-TCM.com was meant to depict the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. Producer Mitsuharu Ishii was a senior member of the Japanese branch of the Unification Church, whose leader, Sun Myung Moon,Slate's Bad Movies: Oscar Slumming - Slate on YouTube claimed he had the film made to show MacArthur's spirituality and connection to God and the Japanese people.s:U.S. v. Sun Myung Moon 532 F.Supp. 1360 (1982) Its eventual production cost of $46 million resulted in a $5 million box office gross, and The New York Times review written by Vincent Canby calls the movie \"the most expensive B-movie ever\". The Washington Post described Inchon as \"one of the biggest commercial disasters in film history\". Every conceivable kind of problem plagued production, including labor issues, the U.S. military withdrawing support due to the film's Unification Church connection, weather and natural disasters, customs difficulties, expensive directorial blunders, and the original director (Andrew McLaglen) quitting before the start of production. Olivier's performance was criticised, and he was awarded the 1982 Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor. The film itself took the 1982 Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and Young's direction earned him a tie for Worst Director of 1982. A number of reviewers at various media outlets described Inchon as the worst film ever made, including The Washington Post, Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. To date, Inchon has never been released on home video in the United States although it was aired on the church's Good Life TV Network.Inchon - The Cinema Snob on YouTube === Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981) === The adventure film Tarzan, the Ape Man, loosely based on the novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, stars Miles O'Keefe (who would later become famous in the 1984 Conan the Barbarian knock-off Ator the Invincible alongside its sequel featured in two episodes of the cult TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000) in the title role and Bo Derek as his partner Jane Parker, and is told from Jane's point of view. Despite being a box office success, it was poorly received by critics upon its release, due to its poor screenplay, bad acting, and unintentional humor. Leonard Maltin, writing for his Movie Guide, stated that the film \"lacks action, humor and charm\", and considered it so bad that it \"nearly forced editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB\". Leslie Halliwell was equally harsh; he described Tarzan, the Ape Man as \"certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the most banal film so far made; even the animals give poor performances\".Leslie Halliwell, John Walker, Halliwell's Film Guide. HarperPerennial, 1996 (p. 1119). Writer Thomas S. Hischak described it thus: \"Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, Tarzan, the Ape Man often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made.\"Thomas S. Hischak, American Literature on Stage and Screen: 525 Works and Their Adaptations McFarland, 2012. (p. 237) Film critic John Nesbit considered it \"my pick for worst film ever\", while Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote, \"this cinematic atrocity truly is one of the all-time worsts\". Tarzan, the Ape Man was nominated for six awards at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Actress (Bo Derek). It holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews. === Mommie Dearest (1981) === Faye Dunaway regretted her Razzie-winning portrayal of Academy Award-winning actress Joan Crawford on the 1981 camp classic Mommie Dearest yet it earned a spot at #41 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains. Mommie Dearest was based on the memoir of the same name by Christina Crawford about her upbringing by Joan Crawford.MUBI It was the first film to sweep the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, winning a total of five Razzies out of the nine nominations, including \"Worst Picture\" and Worst Actress (Faye Dunaway, shared with Bo Derek).

The film is part of the \"100 most awful\" in the book The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst. Entertainment writer Michael Sauter included the film in his book The Worst Movies of All Time. It earned, as film critic and television host Richard Crouse put it, \"some of the nastiest reviews ever\". Eric Henderson of CBS Minneapolis named it at the top of his \"Best 'Worst Movies Ever list. Roger Ebert wrote of this film, \"I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie. \"Mommie Dearest\" is a painful experience that drones on endlessly, as Joan Crawford's relationship with her daughter, Christina, disintegrates from cruelty through jealousy into pathos.\" Of the performance of Faye Dunaway, Variety said \"Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, co-stars and all.\" Variety, Jan. 1, 1981 Despite the reviews at the time, the film was a box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. It has a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus reads, \"Mommie Dearest certainly doesn't lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaway's legendary performance as a wire-wielding monster; unfortunately, the movie is too campy and undisciplined to transcend guilty pleasure\". === D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam (The Man Who Saved the World) (1982) === The Turkish science- fiction adventure D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam (also commonly known as Turkish Star Wars) was directed by \u00c7etin \u0130nan\u00e7 and starred C\u00fcneyt Ark\u0131n. It is notorious for illegally using footage from well-known science fiction films and shows, most notably Star Wars, along with stealing the music score from films such as Moonraker and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film is also criticized for its nonsensical plot, badly written dialogue, and crude special effects. Jos Kirps of ArticlesBase called it \"The Worst Movie Ever\", and stated, \"There are many bad sci-fi movies, and for many years movie addicts even considered Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space the worst movie of all times. But Plan 9 is still a pretty good movie when compared to D\u00fcnyayi Kurtaran Adam.\" Sabah called it the \"world's worst film\". News article from Sabah newspaper (Last accessed August 29, 2013). H\u00fcrriyet described the film as \"sitting on the throne of the king\" when compared to other \"so bad it's good\" cult films. News article from H\u00fcrriyet (Last accessed August 29, 2013). Toronto Standard called it a \"dollar-store Star Wars\" and compared it to the works of Ed Wood.

Unfortunately, it's not that good.\" John J.B. Wilson included it in The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the most enjoyable bad movies ever, saying: \"In rough cut, The Lonely Lady was one of the funniest bad movies ever made.\" Dennis Schwartz called it \"A true candidate for one of the worst films ever.\" Zadora herself said that The Lonely Lady was \"a real turkey, done very badly\", that she \"knew it was bad all along\" and that despite being taken seriously by its director it became a \"camp classic, one of those movies that's so bad it's funny.\" The film was nominated for eleven Golden Raspberry Awards (a record at that time until being surpassed by Showgirls with 13 nominations) and won six: Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Musical Score, Worst Original Song (\"The Way You Do It\"), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay.

Bo and John Derek, however, make films so sincerely bad that they offer nothing in the way of relief.\" Alan Jones of Radio Times named it \"One of the funniest bad movies ever made\". Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing said: \"I daresay even waterboarding is less punishing than watching this.\" Fade In included it on its list of the \"30 worst vanity projects of all time\".

Orange Coast Magazine writer Marc Weinberg and Leonard Maltin criticized the decision to shoot the film in live action. Maltin described it as a \"hopeless mess ... a gargantuan production which produces a gargantuan headache\".

Jay Carr of The Boston Globe claimed that \"They Don't Get Much Worse Than Howard, Glenn Heath Jr. of Slant Magazine wrote that it \"has a rightful place in the canon of worst films ever\", and TV Guide states it is \"one of the worst big-budget movies ever made\".

The movie received 5 nominations at the seventh Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Actor, Worst Screenplay and Worst Original Song as well as a nomination for Worst Picture at the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. The San Diego Union criticized the movie saying, \"In its campy nostalgia for old adventure films, Shanghai Surprise is cloddish. There's something rotten at the core about a movie that would recycle lines like \"That's mighty white of you.\" Even sadder is the realization that some of the old cornball movies are still fresher, more alive, than this regurgitation.\" The Lexington Herald-Leader critic claimed \"This film is bad. The acting is terrible. The hackneyed screenplay traffics in stereotype and yuk-yuk jokes. And the point is non-existent.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer gave 1 star out of five to the picture describing it as: \"...so dismally scripted and directed that no one could redeem it... an atmospheric, handsomely shot and, sadly, utterly empty piece of work.\" The San Jose Mercury News attributed a half-star rating to the movie, declaring, \"Shanghai Surprise stars Madonna and Sean Penn together for the first time and has songs by George Harrison. That is the most positive sentence that can be written about the film, now playing locally.\" The Miami Herald, gave the movie 1 star out of 4, commenting, \"In Shanghai Surprise, as you may have heard, almost everything is just a bit off. Though widely anticipated as a musical, Shanghai Surprise is actually a kind of miniaturization of Raiders of the Lost Ark/Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, with a feisty heroine (Madonna) in the vain [sic] of Rita Hayworth in The Lady From Shanghai, and a roguish adventure hero (Sean Penn) as well as a pop-sprinkled score (partly the work of George Harrison)... There's a plot here, involving Madonna's quest to find a load of hijacked opium for conversion to morphine to help the troops fighting the Japanese. Penn, though he spends his big scene panting in a brothel, will save the day. But the film was conceived and executed as a star vehicle. Wrong stars, wrong roles, not much happening here. And for George Harrison and his Handmade Films, the first big bust.\" === Ishtar (1987) === Ishtar director Elaine May defended her 1987 box office flop, stating, \"If all of the people who hate Ishtar had seen it, I would be a rich woman today.\" Ishtar was written and directed by Elaine May and starred Academy Award- winning duo Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman as an ode to the Road to... film series featuring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

San Jose Mercury News claimed that \"Time has not improved this film's reputation as being one of the worst ever made.\" Time Out suggested it was \"so bad it could have been deliberate\", and called it \"one of the worst films ever made\", while Hot Air referred to it as \"The Citizen Kane of big-budget, A-list vehicular homicides.\" It was included in Michael Sauter's The Worst Movies of All Time book and Richard Roeper included it on his list of the 40 worst films he had seen.Richard Roeper, 10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed and Other Surprising Movie Lists, New York: Hyperion Books, 2003, pp. 66\u201367 In 1999, Time placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century. However, the film has since become a cult classic,10 Movies With Low Ratings That Are Actually Good-Film InquiryStreamline-The Official Filmstruck Blog-An Evening with Elaine May (and ISHTAR) and it has also seen a recent minor critical re-evaluation, with some critics, including Richard Brody, praising the film, and directors Quentin Tarantino, Edgar Wright and Martin Scorsese liking it. Defenders argue that the studio did not back May, resulting in a public relations disaster before it was released in theaters. Joe Queenan compared the film to another comedy film considered the worst, Gigli, and wrote that although it was considered one of the worst films ever made at the time of its release, it \"has several comic moments\" and does not get worse on subsequent viewings, unlike Gigli. May would not direct again until she announced in 2019, then 87 years old, that she would make a film titled Crackpot. === Nukie (1987) === Nukie is a 1987 South African film directed by Sias Odendaal (credited as Sias Odendal) and Michael Pakleppa, and starring Steve Railsback, Ronald France, and Glynis Johns. The plot concerns an alien, Nukie, who crash lands on earth and seeks help from two children to reunite with his brother, Miko, who has been captured by the U.S. government. The film was heavily inspired by Steven Spielberg's 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Simon Abrams of Politico wrote that Nukie was worse than 1988 E.T. knock-off, Mac and Me, writing that it is \"probably the most incompetent E.T. ripoff of any time period ... While Mac and Me was just rotten and ill-conceived, Nukie is uniquely perplexing\". Critic Brad Jones has said that Nukie is the worst film he has ever reviewed. Total Film named Nukie the worst kids movie ever made. They also named it one of the worst science-fiction films ever made. === Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) === Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was the last film in the Christopher Reeve series of Superman films, and co-starred Mark Pillow as the villain Nuclear Man. Despised by fans and critics alike, it is the lowest- grossing film in the series, only taking in $15,681,020 at the North American box office. Many critics pointed out the film's poor screenplay, acting, and special effects (such as a scene in which Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with his super-vision), while some have criticized it for its lack of attention to the comic book source material. Such special effects led Rita Kempley of The Washington Post to call it \"one of the cheesiest movies ever made\". Film critic Jeffrey Lyles voiced similar hatred, claiming that the film \"isn't just one of the worst comic book films, it's one of the worst films ever made\". Superman IV holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews. It appears on Empire list of the 50 worst movies of all time, as well as the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. The film was nominated for two Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Worst Visual Effects. === The Garbage Pail Kids Movie (1987) === The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is a live-action adaptation of the then-popular trading card series of the same name, itself a gross-out parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. The title characters are depicted by dwarf actors in low- budget costumes, with poorly functioning mouths and expressionless faces. The film is often criticized for its gross-out humor, nonsensical plot, poor explanations, bad acting, and the unsettling appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 1, making it tied for the lowest scoring film on the site. Caryn James of The New York Times said the movie is \"too repulsive for children or adults of any age\"Top 10 Movies So Bad They Were Pulled From Theatres- WatchMojo on YouTube and is \"enough to make you believe in strict and faraway boarding schools\". Carlos Coto of the Sun-Sentinel called it \"one of the worst ever made\". Much of its content is said to be inappropriate for children, its intended audience. Throughout the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids steal, get in fights, bite toes off people, flatulate in people's faces, threaten others with switchblades, urinate upon themselves, and run over cars. In addition to scatological behavior, the movie has several scenes that feature sexual images, violence, and drinking. Offended parents launched a nationwide protest of the movie that successfully resulted in the movie being withdrawn from circulation. The shortened release contributed to the movie's poor gross of only $1,576,615. It was nominated for three Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Visual Effects, Worst New Star for the Garbage Pail Kids collectively, and Worst Original Song. === Leonard Part 6 (1987) === Bill Cosby became the first person to accept a Golden Raspberry Award for Leonard Part 6, which he said was the worst movie ever made Leonard Part 6, starring (as well as written and produced by) Bill Cosby, was intended as a parody of spy movies. Leonard Parker, a former CIA spy, is brought out of retirement to save the world from an evil vegetarian who brainwashes animals to kill people. Rita Kempley at The Washington Post noted the large number of Coca-Cola product placements and said \"The only good thing about Bill Cosby's Leonard Part 6 is that we didn't have to see Parts 1 through 5.\" Scott Weinberg at DVD Talk noted the film as \"truly one of the worst movies you'll ever see ... movies this bad should be handled with Teflon gloves and a pair of tongs\". By 1990, Dennis King of Tulsa World wrote that the film had \"become synonymous with 'bomb.'\" Total Film included Leonard Part 6 on their list of the \"66 Worst Films of all Time\". Cosby himself disowned the film, and when it was released to theaters he publicly advised people not to see it. It earned Golden Raspberrys for Worst Actor (Cosby), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. It was also nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Director. Cosby became the first person to accept a Golden Raspberry Award, and said \"It was the worst movie I ever made - the worst movie anyone ever made\". === Hobgoblins (1988) === Hobgoblins, by Rick Sloane, is widely considered a low-budget knock-off that capitalizes on the popularity of the 1984 film Gremlins. It gained popularity in 1998 after being featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. MST3K writer Paul Chaplin later commented on Hobgoblins, saying, \"Oh, man. You have no idea the torture it was to watch this movie several times in the space of a week. It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done.\" Specific points of the film that were lampooned was the extreme misogyny and atrocious treatment of women, the film's technical incompetence and repetitive scenes, its moronic, very poorly conceived plot, its dreadful acting, its ugly look and its preference towards rather needless vulgarity, particularly in regards to its characters and subject matter. Greg Muskewitz at Efilmcritic.com called it \"Jim Henson's worst nightmare\", while David Cornelius of DVD Talk stated, \"There's not one aspect of this movie that isn't the Worst Thing Ever.\" After seeing the MST3K episode himself, Sloane was inspired to direct a sequel, which was released in 2009.Hobgoblins (2008) - MUBI === Mac and Me (1988) === Mac and Me is about a young boy in a wheelchair who meets and befriends an alien who has crash-landed on Earth. A box office failure, the film grossed $6,424,112 in the United States on a $13 million budget. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, whose critical consensus notes that it is \"duly infamous\" as both an imitation of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and a marketing vehicle for McDonald's and Coca-Cola (the filmmakers had admitted a profit-sharing arrangement with the former). One scene features a large, impromptu dance-off with the alien (dressed in a teddy bear costume), a football team, Ronald McDonald, and various other people inside and outside of a McDonald's restaurant. Leonard Maltin described the film as being \"more like a TV commercial than a movie\", and Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle called it a \"shameless E.T. knockoff\". Mac and Me is widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made, with The Telegraph reporting that it is \"frequently pulled out in 'worst film of all time' arguments\". Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (responsible for the 2004 Oscar-nominated Super Size Me) declared it the \"worst thing you'll ever see in your entire life\", as well as the most egregious example of product placement in cinema history. The film was also named the worst ever in the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as by broadcaster Simon Mayo and writer/producer Damon Lindelof. Michael Hayden of GQ India referred to it as \"hands down the worst family movie in Hollywood history\". The film was nominated for four Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and won two trophies: Worst Director for Stewart Raffill (tied with Blake Edwards for Sunset) and Worst New Star for Ronald McDonald in a cameo. Mac and Me has however gained a cult following and was featured on the second season of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival (the only Razzie-winning film ever to be riffed in the history of the show).\u2018Mystery Science Theater 3000\u2019 Will Tackle \u2018Mac And Me\u2019 In Season 2 - UPROXX === Things (1989) === Things, a Canadian low budget, independent, horror exploitation film, was written and produced by Andrew Jordan & Barry J. Gillis. It cost approximately $35,000 in total to make and marked the mainstream film debut of porn star Amber Lynn. It was ostensibly made as homage to horror icons and films, such as George A. Romero and his Night of the Living Dead. Cinema Sewer magazine has repeatedly proclaimed that \"this is the worst movie ever made\".\"Things on DVD!!\", Cinema Sewer, 12 September 2008 Robin Bougie, its founder and editor, wrote \"I don't mean [\"bad\"] like the way Troma makes bad movies. I'm talking about bad with the best of intentions, like all of the best \"bad\" movies. You like tormenting yourself with hilariously trashy, moronic, gory, idiotic bad films? Things is the fucking king of bad movies. This is the movie you put on when you have a get together of pals \u2014 and just blow them away. Trust me, you have never seen anything like this in your life. It's absolutely astonishing in how it is able to mentally wreck anyone who watches it.\" Jeff Kirschner of Dread Central has also named it the worst movie ever made. Things was covered in an episode of RedLetterMedia show Half in the Bag; during the discussion Jay Bauman stated that Things was \"probably one of the worst movies ever made\", to which Mike Stoklasa replied \"I would remove 'probably'.\" == 1990s == === Troll 2 (1990) === Despite its title, Troll 2 does not feature any trolls (the antagonists are actually goblins) and has no relation to the original film, which was also poorly reviewed.Janet Maslin, The New York Times, January 17, 1986; Patricia Smith, The Chicago Sun-Times, January 20, 1986; Alan Carter, The New York Daily News, January 17, 1986; Rex Reed, January 17, 1986 NPR claims that it is \"known as the worst movie of all time\" while The A.V. Club calls it \"a popular candidate for the worst film ever made\". Rumsey Taylor of Not Coming to a Theater Near You opined that it was \"one of the worst films I've ever seen\". Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress gave it one-half star out of five, and stated in his review, \"There are movies that are bad. There are movies that are so-bad- they're-good. And then there's Troll 2\u2014a movie that's so bad that it defies comprehension.\" In addition, TV Guide proclaimed that \"Troll 2 is really as bad as they come.\" Nearly twenty years after its release, the movie's child star, Michael Stephenson, made a documentary about its production and fanbase titled Best Worst Movie, released to critical success in 2009.Best Worst Movie (2010) - Rotten Tomatoes The bad acting and dialogue have become notorious for their camp value; the scene in which Darren Ewing's character states that he will be eaten next has become even an Internet meme, often appearing in videos alongside the \"Garbage Day\" meme from Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2. === Highlander 2: The Quickening (theatrical version, 1991) === The French-British film Highlander 2: The Quickening is a sequel to the cult film Highlander, which transitions the fantasy of the original film into science fiction, and retcons the mystical warriors of the first film into aliens. It was met with harsh criticism by both critics and audiences. Based on 24 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 0% \"Rotten\" rating. Common criticisms included the lack of motivation for the characters, the blatant disregard for established characters and background set forth in the first film (such as the new and seemingly incongruent origin for the Immortals), the massive number of gigantic plot holes, the film's messy, nonsensical story structure, the filmmaker's inability to balance the rather unrelated plots and subplots involved, the unexplained resurrection of Ramirez, and rampantly apparent contradictions in the film's internal logic.Highlander 2: Renegade Version-IGN Roger Ebert named it the worst film of 1991, stating: \"If there is a planet somewhere whose civilization is based on the worst movies of all time, Highlander 2: The Quickening deserves a sacred place among their most treasured artifacts.\" An IGN review said: \"How bad is this movie? Well, imagine if Ed Wood were alive today, and someone gave him a multi-million dollar budget. See his imagination running rampant, bringing in aliens from outer space with immensely powerful firearms, immortals who bring each other back to life by calling out their names, epic duels on flying skateboards, and a blatant disregard for anything logical or previously established\u2014now you are starting to get closer to the vision of Highlander II.\"\"Highlander 2: Renegade Version Review\", IGN, June 16, 2000 In 1995, the film's director Russell MulcahyHighlander II: The Quickening (1991)-MUBI made a director's cut version known as Highlander 2: Renegade Version and then later released another version simply known as Highlander 2: The Special Edition for its 2004 DVD release. The film was reconstructed on both occasions largely from existing material, with certain scenes removed and others added back in, and the entire sequence of events changed. The reconstructed film's reception was far better than the original's; it was elevated to a mixed reception. === Cattive ragazze (Bad Girls) (1992) === The Italian erotic thriller Cattive ragazze (Bad Girls) was directed by gossip columnist Marina Ripa di Meana, and stars Eva Grimaldi as a recently divorced woman falling in love with a male stripper, alongside a cast of big names such as Anita Ekberg and Burt Young. The production received bad publicity, as it was made using money from the country's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. Paolo Mereghetti in his film encyclopedia Dizionario dei Film described the film as a \"vapid mess that can only serve those incapable of understanding what cinema is\", and considered it able to \"compete for the title of worst film in cinema history and win!\" G. Giraud wrote in Il Lavoro that Cattive ragazze \"does not resemble anything in a real movie, or even recall anything previously seen at the cinema, even in its worst\". Film critic Marco Giusti refers to it as \"one of the pillars of Italian trash cinema\". While Cattive ragazze was Ripa Di Meana's directorial debut, she never made another film. === North (1994) === The Rob Reiner film North is an adaptation of the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel, who also wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film. North, which was also Scarlett Johansson's film debut, was a critical and commercial failure, earning only $7,138,449 worldwide despite its budget of over $40 million. It was widely criticized for its plot, its all-star cast of insensitive characters, lack of humor and portrayal of numerous ethnic stereotypes. It has a 14% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and, in his review, infamously wrote, \"I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\" He continued saying \"\"North\" is a bad film \u2013 one of the worst movies ever made\", and it is also on his list of most hated films. Both Ebert and Gene Siskel named North as the worst film of 1994. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said in his review that \"North is director Rob Reiner's first flat-out failure, a sincerely wrought, energetically made picture that all the same crashes on takeoff. It's strange and oddly distasteful, at its best managing to be bad in some original and unexpected ways.\" Richard Roeper named North as one of the 40 worst movies he has ever seen, saying that, \"Of all the films on this list, North may be the most difficult to watch from start to finish.\" The film was nominated for the following awards at the 15th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Bruce Willis, also for Color of Night), Worst Supporting Actress (Kathy Bates), Worst Supporting Actor (Dan Aykroyd, also for Exit to Eden), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay (Andrew Scheinman and Alan Zweibel). === Dis \u2013 en historie om kj\u00e6rlighet (A Story About Love) (1995) === The Norwegian romantic film Dis \u2013 en historie om kj\u00e6rlighet was directed by Aune Sand. The film follows different couples and their love stories around the world, in Cairo, Normandy, Oslo and New York City. Dis received universally poor reviews by critics, and has been called the most poorly reviewed Norwegian film in history. Critic Harald Kolstad of Dagsavisen gave it a score of zero, refused to acknowledge Dis as a film, and claimed to have never seen anything worse. Aftenposten referred to the film as \"the largest turkey\" and \"the most reviled film\", and Total Film included it on its list of the 66 worst films ever made. Despite being a critical disaster it became a commercial success, gaining cult film status with a following akin to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with fans embracing its \"so bad it's good\" qualities. Director Aune Sand insists that Dis is a masterpiece. === Showgirls (1995) === Director Paul Verhoeven, whose Showgirls earned a record 13 Golden Raspberry Award nominations, was the first person to attend the ceremony and accept the awards in person. A large amount of hype for Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls was put behind promoting the sex and nudity in this NC-17 French-American film with a $45 million budget, but the final result was critically derided. Most of the hype revolved around the film's star, Elizabeth Berkley, who only two years before had been one of the stars of the Saturday morning teen sitcom Saved by the Bell. The film won seven Razzie Awards, a record at that time, and received 13 nominations, a record that still stands. It received an additional award at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, where it was awarded Worst Picture of the Decade. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it, \"a film of thunderous oafishness that gives adult subject matter the kind of bad name it does not need or deserve\", while Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com stated, \"Even the grossest porn is more cheerfully sexual than this movie.\" Michael Dequina of TheMovieReport.com also criticized the film, claiming that it was \"the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer\". Adam White wrote in The Independent that it was \"the worst movie ever made\" but also a masterpiece. Stephen Lynch of the Knight Ridder/Tribune similarly named it the worst movie ever made, calling it \"so bad it may be brilliant\". Rotten Tomatoes selected it as one of 25 movies that are so bad they're unmissable while Empire featured it on its poll of the worst films ever made. Showgirls was also featured in Michael Sauter's The Worst Movies of All Time book as well as The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst. Despite being a critical failure and failing at the box office initially, Showgirls found success as a camp cult film, particularly among the LGBT community, but whether the film intended to be satirical remains subject to debate. On the home video market, the film was MGM's most profitable release for years. === Striptease (1996) === A comedy-drama directed by Andrew Bergman, based on a novel by Carl Hiaasen, Striptease centers on a woman (Demi Moore) who becomes a stripper in order to fund an appeal for custody of her daughter. The film was criticized as boring and humourless, and was also accused of being a vanity project for Moore.Brian D. Johnson, \"A Demi-talented actor bares all\", Maclean's 7/08/96, Vol. 109 Issue 28, page 49. Daniel P. Franklin, discussing Striptease in his book Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States stated \"This is the worst film ever made.\"Daniel P. Franklin, Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States. Lanham, Rowman and Littlefield, 2006, , (p. 203). Joe Queenan cited Striptease as an example of what he considered the poor quality of contemporary Hollywood cinema: \"One thing that I admire about films like Striptease is that they serve as powerful reminders that on any given day, Hollywood has the potential to release the worst film in history.\"Joe Queenan, Red Lobster, White Trash, and the Blue Lagoon: Joe Queenan's America Hyperion Books, 1999 , (p.50 ) Richard Schickel in Time, also criticized the film: \"Bergman ... misses Hiaasen's strength: setting mean-funny characters spinning through lowlife milieus ... the crazy, nothing-to-lose anarchy of people living below the margin and beyond the fringe is not within Bergman's fastidious reach.\" Leonard Maltin stated that Striptease was \"Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or bad enough, to qualify as entertainment in any category.\"Leonard Maltin, ed., Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide. A Signet Book, 2001, page 1323. Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's stated \"While Showgirls was honestly sleazy, Striptease is tacky, pretentious \u2013 and boring. Trying to be a comedy, a morality tale and a titillating sideshow, Striptease fails on all counts.\" Striptease was awarded six Golden Raspberry awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actress (Moore), Worst Original Song (\"(Pussy Pussy Pussy) Whose Kitty Cat Are You?\"), and Worst Screen Couple (Moore and Burt Reynolds).\"Moore, Striptease get blasted with Razzie for Worst Picture, 5 others\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 24, 1997, (p. 66). === Le Jour et la Nuit (Day and Night) (1997) === The French romance film Le Jour et la Nuit was directed by philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. It follows a French author who fled to Mexico for a quiet life and an actress who is willing to seduce him to get a part in a film adapted from one of his books. Before its release, Le Jour et la Nuit was heavily promoted in many French newspapers and magazines.Jade Lindgaard and Xavier De La Porte, The Imposter: BHL in Wonderland (Translated by John Howe) London; Verso, 2012. (p. 48-9). When the film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, hundreds of journalists walked out of the screening and those that stayed audibly ridiculed it. Following its release, Le Jour et la Nuit was very harshly criticized by the French media. G\u00e9rard Lefort of Lib\u00e9ration described the film as \"BHL pedalling through guacamole\", and it was also panned by Le Monde and Le Nouvel Observateur. The film also did poorly commercially, with only 73,147 seats for Le Jour et la Nuit having been sold two months after its release. Le Jour et la Nuit was considered the worst French film since 1945 by film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma, and considered as a possible \"worst film in history\" by the French version of Slate. Variety said the film was -out-loud awful without touching the cult realm of 'so bad it's good, Fran\u00e7oise Giroud stated that a bad movie, there's no question\", and L'Humanit\u00e9 called it an \"Absolute debacle\". An original documentary, Anatomy of a Massacre, was released with the Le Jour et la Nuit DVD, and focused on its intense negative reception and failure. === Batman & Robin (1997) === Batman & Robin (1997) was named the worst movie ever made by Empire Batman & Robin is a superhero film based on the DC character Batman and is the fourth and final installment of the Burton/Schumacher Batman film series. It is directed by Joel Schumacher and stars George Clooney as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, Chris O'Donnell as Robin/Dick Grayson, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl/Barbara Wilson and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. This film was largely criticized for its toyetic and camp approach, Mr. Freeze's approach and one-line jokes, as well as its possible homosexual innuendo. , review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 11% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 89 reviews, certifying it \"Rotten\" with an average rating of 3.7/10, and the critics consensus: \"Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for.\" By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 28/100, based on 21 reviews. International Business Times included it on its list of Hollywood's top five worst movies ever made. Michael J. Nelson, of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame, wrote of the movie in his book, Movie Megacheese, \"Batman & Robin is not the worst movie ever. No, indeed. It's the worst thing ever. Yes, it's the single worst thing that we as human beings have ever produced in recorded history.\" Batman & Robin also came in first in an Empire poll of the 50 worst films ever. Joel Schumacher apologized to disappointed fans on the 2005 DVD release of Batman & Robin. === The Avengers (1998) === An adaptation of the popular 1960s British series of the same name, The Avengers starred Ralph Fiennes as John Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma Peel, with Sean Connery as their antagonist, Sir August de Wynter. It was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. The Avengers began to receive negative publicity after Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers. After early test screenings, The Avengers was heavily edited by the studio. On its release, The Avengers was savaged by film critics, with the Birmingham Post stating \"The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made\" and adding that one reviewer had joked the film was such a \"turkey\" that the makers should have handed distribution to the poultry chain Bernard Matthews. Several reviewers disparaged The Avengers for lacking the wit and excitement of its source material. Janet Maslin strongly criticised The Avengers: \"With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of Howard the Duck that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of \"Ugh!\" on the way out the door\" and finished her review with, \"At a pared-down, barely rational 100 minutes, The Avengers is short but not short enough.\" David Bianculli said \"This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name.\" Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated \"The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department ... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy.\" The Avengers also shared a Razzie Award for \"Worst Remake or Sequel\" with the 1998 adaptations of Psycho and Godzilla at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards. Total Film magazine later voted Fiennes and Thurman in The Avengers as \"The Worst Movie Double Act Of All Time\". The film also appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films. === Cinderela Baiana (Bahian Cinderella) (1998) === The Brazilian film Cinderela Baiana was directed by Conrado Sanchez and stars former \u00c9 o Tchan! dancer Carla Perez in the lead role. It is a heavily fictionalized biographical account of Perez's early life and how she came into fame. Despite an all-star cast, including Alexandre Pires, Perez's then-boyfriend and a very popular singer in Brazil at the time, the movie was criticized for its campy dialogue, badly written script, numerous plot holes and ludicrous acting, to the point of Perez herself disowning the film years later.\"'Eu era uma crian\u00e7a sem maldade', diz dan\u00e7arina Carla Perez sobre \u00c9 o Tchan!\" \u2013 Meio Norte, May 14, 2008 It was a box office bomb, and it was some time later banned from circulation by request of Perez herself. It was also the debut of a then-unknown L\u00e1zaro Ramos, who used his salary to pay for acting classes. On March 15, 2010, Brazilian magazine Veja made a Top 10 list of the worst Brazilian movies of all time, and Cinderela Baiana was featured in first place. The reviewer, Pollyane Lima e Silva, called the film \"a shame\".Os Piores 10 Filmes da Hist\u00f3ria do Cinema Brasileiro , Pollyane Lima e Silva; Veja, March 15, 2010 Author Renzo Mora included it in his 25 Movies That Can Ruin Your Life book, while Luis Nassif claimed that, \"For me this is the worst of all.\"Os 25 Piores Filmes do Mundo, Luis Nassif; Avido.com.br, May 20, 2011 === Fatal Deviation (1998) === Fatal Deviation is often credited as being the first martial arts film to be filmed in Ireland. It stars martial artist James Bennett and Michael Graham, who is best known for being a member of the boy band Boyzone. The Irish Post and Den of Geek write that it is a mainstay of worst film lists. Luke McKinney of Cracked.com called it the worst film ever made, writing: \"There are so many things about making a movie that Jimmy doesn't know, that you could replace film school with this movie alone-- just screening it once for students and asking them to list all the things it did wrong. Anyone who doesn't write 'everything' instantly fails.\" The Irish Post named it the worst Irish film of all time, and the Irish Independent wrote that it is \"regarded as one of the worst films ever made\". Entertainment.ie placed it on its list of \"10 So Bad They're Good Movies You Need To See Before You Die\" and it was covered in Pastes Bad Movie Diaries column. === Parting Shots (1999) === The British black comedy Parting Shots was the last film directed by Michael Winner. It starred rock musician Chris Rea as a man who, told he has only six months to live, begins murdering people who have wronged him. Parting Shots was accused of being poorly acted, filmed and scripted, as well as treating murder flippantly.Christopher Tookey, \"Michael Winner's latest film is his most offensive yet.\" The Daily Mail, May 11, 1999, (p.11). Andrew Collins took a very negative view of the film: \"Parting Shots ... is going to set the course of British film-making back 20 years. It is not only the worst British film produced in this country since Carry On Emmannuelle (quite a feat in itself), it is a thoroughbred contender for the crown of Worst Film Ever Made.\"Andrew Collins, \"How to Shoot a Real Turkey\" The Observer, March 28, 1999. Observer Screen, p.6. Christopher Tookey was even more harsh, stating: \"Parting Shots is not only the most horrible torture for audiences that Winner has ever devised. It is also profoundly offensive, even by Winner standards\" and later called Parting Shots \"the most tasteless, abysmal comedy of all time\". Tookey also stated that Winner had \"established himself, over his last dozen films, as beyond doubt the worst director of all time\". In an interview about the film, Charlotte O'Sullivan, the Independent's film editor, claimed Parting Shots was \"the worst film I've ever seen\". O'Sullivan also criticised it for glorifying vigilantism: \"It's Michael Winner and you know, he doesn't have any sense of irony. He seems to be saying it is okay to go and kill people.\"\"Winner's Turkey has a bad aftertaste\". The Sunday Herald, May 2, 1999 (p.7) The journalist Miles Kington later claimed \"Parting Shots ... was directed by Michael Winner and despite the glittering cast, was possibly the worst film ever made.\"Miles Kingston, \"One or two plots to occupy my declining years\". The Independent, May 3, 2005, (p.30). I. Q. Hunter listed Parting Shots as one of the candidates for \"the Worst British film ever made\". Parting Shots was also featured in a poll of Empire magazine readers' \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll. === The Underground Comedy Movie (1999) === The comedy The Underground Comedy Movie is based on a cable access show from 1988. Director and lead actor Vince Offer constructed the film out of a series of tasteless, lowbrow skits (including Gena Lee Nolin loudly using the restroom and a superhero named Dickman who dresses in a giant penis costume and defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen). In 1999, Offer filed a suit against 20th Century Fox and the co-directors of There's Something About Mary, Bobby and Peter Farrelly, claiming that 14 scenes in Mary were stolen from his film. The Farrellys released this statement: \"We've never heard of him, we've never heard of his movie, and it's all a bunch of baloney.\" Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times referred to it as a \"wretched film\" and stated that \"'The Underground Comedy Movie' stands as a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion.\" Rod Dreher of the New York Post said it \"may be the least amusing comedy ever made\". Nathan Rabin covered the film in his column detailing terrible films and stated that: \"nothing I\u2019ve covered for this column was quite as soul-crushingly, brain-meltingly terrible as ... The Underground Comedy Movie.\" Thom Bennett at Film Journal International, wrote \"Anyone offended by unbearably bad films, jokes that are not funny and wasting 90 minutes of their lives is, as promised, guaranteed to be offended. In fact, to even call this mess a comedy is giving it far too much credit\", and \"The Underground Comedy Movie may well be the worst film I have ever seen.\" Writing in Central Western Daily, Peter Young said, \"I am pretty sure that I can declare this The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen.\" == 2000s == === Battlefield Earth (2000) === John Travolta during Battlefield Earth promotional tour Battlefield Earth is based on the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same name, and stars John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker. Although a sequel covering the second half of the book was planned, the panning from critics, poor box office performance, and financial ruin of Franchise Pictures killed off such plans. It was criticized for a poor script, hammy acting, overuse of Dutch angles, repetitive dialogue, and several inconsistencies and plot holes. The movie's producer, Franchise Pictures, was later forced out of business after it emerged that it had fraudulently overstated the film's budget by $31 million. It has a 3% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and it was included in their Top 100 worst-reviewed movies of the 2000s. Roger Ebert predicted that the film, \"for decades to come will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies\". Ebert also wrote, \"The director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why\". It is also on his \"most hated\" list. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called it \"a fiasco that occupies a distinguished place high atop the pantheon of widely reviled crap\" and said, \"A legendary disaster well before it finished completion, Battlefield Earth hit theaters with a \"Kick Me\" sign on it so massive it could be detected from outer space.\" It won seven Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple (John Travolta and \"anyone on the screen with him\"). In 2005, an eighth Razzie (for Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years) was awarded to the film, and in 2010 it won a ninth Razzie at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture of the Decade, the most of any film in the history of the awards at the time, before Jack and Jill surpassed its record with ten wins in 2012. The movie appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. Empire named it the second worst movie ever made after Batman & Robin and The Register listed it as the worst movie ever made. Battlefield Earth screenwriter J. David Shapiro later apologized for making \"the suckiest movie ever\". === Honest (2000) === Honest is the directorial debut of Eurythmics member David A. Stewart, and starring three members of the British/Canadian girl group All Saints (Melanie Blatt, Nicole and Natalie Appleton). It received a large amount of media criticism following its release.\"Honest, it's the worst movie ever; All Saints' film debut is holy awful, say critics\". The Daily Record, May 26, 2000 The Scottish newspaper Daily Record described Honest thus: \"This turgid tale of Sixties London isn't just bad \u2013 it's quite probably the worst film ever.\" Peter Bradshaw noted that Honest \"subscribes to the usual credulous fictions about the charm, glamour and wit of violent criminals, and leaves out these qualities in spades\" and added \"However silly and implausible, it would be all right if there was the slightest hint of brio or fun in the script, written by comedy giants Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. But there isn't.\"\"Honest\" Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian, 26 May 2000. Retrieved 2 October 2014. Alexander Walker called Honest \"An ugly, ratty-looking load of jazzy cliches buried in flashy has-been styles, including slowmo frolicking in the Trafalgar Square fountains, strobe-lit druggy sessions and accelerated action on the mattress.\"Alexander Walker, The Evening Standard, 26 May 2000. British film historian I.Q. Hunter later listed Honest as one of the candidates for the title of \"Worst British film ever made\". === Freddy Got Fingered (2001) === The comedy film Freddy Got Fingered stars Tom Green, who also wrote and directed it, featuring largely gross-out and shock humor similar to that featured in The Tom Green Show. In the film, Green stars as a 28-year-old slacker and cartoonist who falsely accuses his father of child molestation when he questions his son's life goals. Freddy Got Fingered received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with CNN critic Paul Clinton declaring it \"quite simply the worst movie ever released by a major studio in Hollywood history.\" Warren Epstein of The Gazette described Freddy Got Fingered as \"the worst movie ever made\". A review in The Washington Post said: \"If ever a movie testified to the utter creative bankruptcy of the Hollywood film industry, it is the abomination known as Freddy Got Fingered.\" Robert Koehler of Variety called it, \"One of the most brutally awful comedies ever to emerge from a major studio.\" Film reviewer Roger Ebert included the film on his \"most hated\" list, gave it zero out of four stars, and wrote: \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.\" Freddy Got Fingered was nominated for eight awards at the 2001 Razzies, and won for Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst On-Screen Couple. Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson called it \"offensive, stupid and obnoxious\" and said it had \"no redeeming value\". Green accepted his awards in person, traveling to the ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolling out his own red carpet to the presentation. The movie has an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2010, the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture of the Decade, though it lost to Battlefield Earth. Freddy Got Fingered also appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, was featured in Empire list of the \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. === Glitter (2001) === Starring Mariah Carey in the lead role as an aspiring singer, the romantic musical drama Glitter was intended to be her breakthrough role but was a critical failure and a box office bomb. Hindustan Times claimed that Glitter \"was slammed by almost all critics for being the worst film ever\". Fade In stated that \"Glitter isn't just one of the worst music-themed films ever \u2014 it's one of the worst films ever made, period.\" Author Bob McCann wrote in Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television that it's \"rightfully in the running as one of the worst films ever made\". News.com.au, Hi, Flavorwire, Metacritic, and Empire are amongst those who have listed it as one of the worst films ever made. Glitter received six Razzie nominations and Carey won for Worst Actress. It was also featured in John Wilson's The Official Razzie Movie Guide, and in 2005, it was nominated for \"Worst Musical of Our First 25 Years\", but lost to From Justin to Kelly. In an interview in 2010, Carey stated that she believed that the film's failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack being released the same day as the September 11 attacks. It has a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews. === Swept Away (2002) === Madonna received a Golden Raspberry Award for her performance in Swept Away, making her the most awarded actress in the institution's history. The movie received five awards at the 2003 ceremony. A remake of a 1974 Italian film of the same name, the romantic comedy film Swept Away was directed by Guy Ritchie and starred his then-wife Madonna and Adriano Giannini. It received mostly extremely negative reviews, with most of the criticism going towards Madonna's bad acting, the original film being considered superior and the remake being considered just a star vehicle for Madonna. Rotten Tomatoes holds a 5% rating, based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 2.76/10. The site's consensus states: \"Muddled and lacking the political context of the original, Swept Away offers further proof that Madonna can't act.\" Metacritic reports an 18 out of 100 rating, based on 27 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Rex Reed of The Observer said: \"If there is one thing worse than a Guy Ritchie movie, it's a Guy Ritchie movie with Madonna in it.\" Joe Queenan of The Guardian discussed the movie in an article on what makes a movie the worst of all time and said, \"[...] Showgirls has a certain campy allure that grows a bit each time I see it. Madonna's Swept Away doesn't; it seems more amateurish on each viewing, like a morass that starts out as a quagmire, then morphs into a cesspool and finally turns into a slime pit on the road to its ultimate destination in the bowels of Hell.\" Julie Burchill, also from The Guardian, selected it as her pick for the worst film ever made. John Anderson of Newsday said, \"New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.\" Swept Away was also a box office bomb; against a $10 million budget, it grossed $598,645 in the United States and around $437,875 from foreign territories for a worldwide total gross of $1,036,520. The film was awarded five awards at the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Madonna), Worst Screen Couple (Madonna and Giannini), Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Director (Ritchie), while also being nominated for Worst Actor (Giannini) and Worst Screenplay. It was the first film to win both Worst Picture and Worst Remake or Sequel. At the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years, and at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst Picture of the Decade, but in both cases lost to Battlefield Earth. Empire ranked it #20 in its list of \"The 50 Worst Movies Ever\", and After Ellen ranked it #7 in its list of \"The worst movies ever to grace the screen\". === The Master of Disguise (2002) === The comedy film The Master of Disguise was produced in part by Adam Sandler and stars Dana Carvey as Pistachio Disguisey, an undercover Italian waiter who must save his father Fabbrizio (James Brolin) from the evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) by using his inherent skills in disguise. Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its flatulence gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as Tony Montana from Scarface). Many critics also pointed out the short running time, consisting of 72 minutes of the film itself and over ten minutes of end credits juxtaposed with outtakes. Roger Ebert gave it one star out of four, claiming, \"The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.\" Alan Morrisson, writing for the film magazine Empire, proclaimed that The Master of Disguise was \"the worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots\", while Matthew Turner of ViewLondon remarked, \"This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.\" In addition, Chris Parry of eFilmCritic.com stated, \"Quite honestly, I've never seen anything less competent. And I mean that.\" The film holds a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 104 reviews, and was featured on the site's list of the top 100 worst-reviewed films of the 2000s. It also appears on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. A cameo appearance by Bo Derek landed her a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards, but she lost to Madonna for Die Another Day. === Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002) === The action film Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as opposing secret agents. Critics panned it, generally regarding it as having no redeeming features, not even the unintentional comedic value normally associated with bad films. They variously described the film as \"A picture for idiots\", \"Boring to an amazing degree\", \"A fine achievement in stupidity and dullness\", \"Dreadful\", \"[Giving] new meaning to the word incoherent\", and \"bad on just about every level\". One critic suggested an alternative title as \"Simplistic: Bullets Vs. Humans\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote, \"You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense.\" Roger Ebert, who included the film in his \"most hated list\", called the movie \"a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence.\" In addition to being lambasted by critics, it was a disaster financially, recouping just over $19.9 million of its $70 million budget. International Business Times included it on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made. In March 2007, the movie review site Rotten Tomatoes ranked it #1 among \"The Worst of the Worst\" movie list, with 108 \"rotten\" reviews and no \"fresh\" ones. Mental Floss also listed it as the worst movie ever made. === Ben and Arthur (2002) === A low-budget 2002 American romantic drama film about the titular gay couple who come into conflict with Arthur's religious brother, Ben and Arthur was written, directed, produced, edited, and scored by Sam Mraovich, who also played the character Arthur. Ben and Arthur received strong criticism (especially from the LGBT community) for its low budget and poor plotting. BuzzFeed described it as the \"worst gay movie of all time\". The gay popular culture site Queerty described Ben and Arthur as \"unintelligible\" and ended its review by calling it the \"Worst. Movie. Ever.\" The gay movie review site Cinemaqueer likewise stated: \"Ben and Arthur is so terrible that it has awoken the dormant Bette Davis in me. It is so painfully bad that it wouldn't even make good fodder on Mystery Science Theater 3000. This just might possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen ... Unless you get a kick out of mocking bad films, avoid this one at all costs.\" Michael Adams, reviewing the film for his book Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies, describes it thus: \"Ben & Arthur is as over-the-top insane as it is ludicrously executed ... the production values, from biscuits on plates comprising the main course of a candlelit dinner to a church literally having a cardboard cross and a cartoon Jesus on the wall, are as bad as anything I've seen.\" A Rotten Tomatoes article placed Ben and Arthur on their list of \"Films So Bad They're Unmissable\", saying \"If Tommy Wiseau's The Room is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich's Ben & Arthur is its gay equivalent.\" Rotten Tomatoes also stated \"Every scene, every line, every hissy fit is simultaneously hilariously amateur and hysterically fever-pitched.\" Total Film ranked Ben and Arthur at #58 in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Mraovich finds Ben and Arthurs placement among the canon of worst films to be a blessing as the film has received more attention than he ever anticipated. === From Justin to Kelly (2003) === The romantic-comedy musical From Justin to Kelly stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the winner and runner-up, respectively, of the first season of American Idol. The film was a critical and commercial disaster, earning only $4.9 million at the North American box office and achieving a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews. Josh Tyrangiel of Time Magazine described From Justin to Kelly as \"a monstrous Idol movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century\",\"Miss Independent\" Josh Tyrangiel. Time Magazine February 5, 2006 (Subscription Required). while The Free Lance\u2013Star referred to it as \"the world's worst movie\".\"Dishing it!\" The Free Lance\u2013Star, July 9th, 2003, (p.56). Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club, reviewing the film for his \"My Year of Flops\" series, stated, \"All films require suspension of disbelief. From Justin To Kelly requires something more like a temporary lobotomy. Nothing about the main characters or their relationships makes sense.\"Contest-Winning Case File #150: From Justin To Kelly Nathan Rabin, The A.V. Club, November 11th, 2009. Retrieved 28 January 2014. It won a special Razzie\u2014\"Governor's Award \u2013 Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography\"\u2014at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards.\"Gigli Takes Razzie Dishonors as Year's Worst\", Reading Eagle, March 1st, 2004 (p.20) It was nominated for eight additional Razzies (including a second special award, \"Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie\"), and a year later it won for Worst \"Musical\" of Our First 25 Years. Total Film included From Justin to Kelly on their list of \"The 66 Worst Films of All Time\", and International Business Times included the film on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made. In a later interview, Clarkson expressed regret over From Justin to Kelly, stating she only did it because she was contractually obligated to do so: \"I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.\" === The Room (2003) === Tommy Wiseau in a promotional picture for the 2003 cult classic The Room The independently produced The Room, about an amiable banker whose friends betray him one by one, has been called \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies\" by some critics. The Guardian, Vox, The Washington Post, ABC Australia and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung called it the worst film ever made. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V Club called it \"the greatest bad movie of our time\" and said, \"The Room is nearly an anti-film\u2014an inane and unintentionally surreal soap opera, filled with non sequiturs, confused characters, and gratuitous, anatomically incorrect sex.\" Though the film's star, writer, producer, and director Tommy Wiseau has claimed it is a black comedy and its numerous flaws are intentional, other actors involved in the production have denied this, saying that Wiseau intended it as a melodramatic romance. The Room has been noted for its bizarre and non-sequiturial dialogue, protracted sex scenes, various subplots that are inadequately resolved or simply disappear altogether (most notably, a character announces that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, but this is never mentioned again throughout the entire film), and infamous use of green-screen for \"outdoor\" rooftop scenes. It made its broadcast premiere as an April Fools' Day special in 2009 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, edited down from its original R rating to a TV-14/DSLV rating. The day after its appearance, its DVD became the top- selling independent film on Amazon.com. In June 2010, The Room started playing at the American Film Institute Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland. Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through their site RiffTrax.com. In 2013, the book The Disaster Artist, written by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, was published; the book is Sestero's memoir of his involvement in the production of the movie. The book was adapted into an Oscar-nominated film\"Call Me by Your Name\" wins Best Adapted Screenplay-Oscars on YouTube2018|Oscars.org of the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Wiseau (winning a Best Actor Golden Globe Award for his performance)James Franco Wins Best Actor, Musical or Comedy at the 2018 Golden GlobesDisaster Artist, The|Golden Globes and his brother Dave Franco as Sestero. === Gigli (2003) === The Martin Brest movie Gigli features Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, with appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. Gigli was originally a black comedy with no romantic subplot. The producers demanded script rewrites throughout filming, hoping to cash in on the Lopez- Affleck romance that was big news in celebrity-watching publications of the time, such as Us and People. This film cost $54 million to make but grossed only $6 million, making it one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. The Times gave the film a zero, making Gigli the lowest scored film review in the publication's history at that time. International Business Times, which included Gigli in its list of Hollywood's top five worst movies ever made, described reviewers calling it \"the ultimate turkey of all time\". The Wall Street Journal stated that it was \"[t]he worst movie\u2014all right, the worst allegedly major movie\u2014of our admittedly young century\", while Roger Friedman of Fox News claimed it was \"[t]he worst movie ever made\". It was also the winner of seven Razzies (including 2005's Worst \"Comedy\" of Our First 25 Years), and in 2010 the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Worst Picture of the Decade\". It is in Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s, where it has a 6% rating. It was also featured in Empires poll of the 50 worst films ever made, and AfterEllen ranked it #1 in its list of the worst films of all time. === Sex Lives of the Potato Men (2004) === The British sex comedy Sex Lives of the Potato Men is about a group of potato delivery men. The film received strongly hostile reviews from the British media. Reviews claimed Sex Lives of the Potato Men was unfunny, disgusting, and depressing.Critics Pan \"Worst Film Ever\" Sky News, 23 February 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2013. Writing in the Daily Mirror, film critic Kevin O'Sullivan called Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"one of the worst films ever made\".Kevin O'Sullivan, The Daily Mirror, March 5th, 2004, (p.14) Novelist Will Self, in his review for The Evening Standard, called Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"mirthless, worthless, toothless, useless\". The Times reviewer James Christopher dubbed Sex Lives of the Potato Men \"one of the two most nauseous films ever made ... a masterclass in film-making ineptitude\". The Sunday Express film critic, Henry Fitzherbert, also strongly condemned the film: \"Sex Lives is so awful it left me slack-jawed in disbelief ... it must be one of the worst British comedies.\"Henry Fitzherbert, The Sunday Express, 22nd February 2004 (p.67). Catherine Shoard, in a critique in The Sunday Telegraph, stated \"It's hard to know what to say to this \u2013 it's like finding the right words at a nasty accident ... Sex Lives of the Potato Men is probably the lewdest Brit-com since Confessions of a Window Cleaner, and certainly the worst.\" Shoard also described the film as \"Less a film than an appetite suppressant.\"Catherine Shoard, The Sunday Telegraph, 22nd February 2004. Alan Morrison in the Scottish Daily Record described it as \"puerile smut of the very worst kind ... Sex Lives of the Potato Men should never have been made\".\"Review:Sex Lives of the Potato Men. Daily Record, February 20th, 2004. The Irish Times later noted that \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men attracted some of the worst reviews in living memory.\"Donald Clarke, \"Out of Office:Interview with Mackenzie Crook\". \"The Ticket\" Magazine, The Irish Times, April 25th, 2008, (p.6). The Birmingham Post described Sex Lives of the Potato Men as \"quite possibly the worst film ever made\",Mike Davies, The Birmingham Post, April 24, 2008 (p. 13). while The Independent on Sunday stated that the film was \"a strong contender for the title of worst film of all time\".Matthew Bell, Independent on Sunday, February 8, 2009, (p. 42). It was also featured in Empires 50 Worst Movies Ever poll. The film has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews. === Catwoman (2004) === Nominally based on the DC Comics character, Catwoman stars Halle Berry as the title character. It bears little resemblance to the Batman antagonist: the cinematic Catwoman has superpowers, unlike in the comics, and leaps from rooftop to rooftop in stiletto heels. The character's signature lycra catsuit was replaced with slashed leather trousers and matching bra, and a mask that also acts as a hat. She also has a different name, Patience Phillips, to the established DC Catwoman character, Selina Kyle. As the movie character differs so widely from her comic book source, the character, as portrayed in this film, has been cited as \"Catwoman in Name Only\". The film was the result of various rewrites by a total of 28 different screenwriters, though only four were credited after arbitration with the WGA. It has a 9% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was declared \"arguably the worst superhero film ever made\" by the Orlando Sentinel. Jean Lowerison of the San Diego Metropolitan said in her review that Catwoman \"goes on my 'worst' list for the year, and quite possibly for all time\". Sadaf Ahsan of the National Post went further, calling it the worst movie ever made. The Village Voice summed up reviews of the film under the title \"Me-Ouch\". The movie was the winner of four Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director (Pitof) and Worst Screenplay. Berry arrived at the ceremony to accept her Razzie in person (with her Best Actress Oscar for Monster's Ball in hand), saying: \"First of all, I want to thank Warner Bros. Thank you for putting me in a piece of shit, god-awful movie ... It was just what my career needed.\"Halle Berry accepts Razzie Award official Razzie YouTube channel It is on Roger Ebert's \"most hated\" list and International Business Times included it on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made. === Daniel \u2013 Der Zauberer (Daniel \u2013 The Wizard) (2004) === The German film Daniel \u2013 Der Zauberer was directed by Ulli Lommel and stars pop singer and ex-Deutschland sucht den Superstar contestant Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck, who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself. The title is misleading as it implies that K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck is \"Der Zauberer\" (\"The Wizard\"), while the sorcerer is actually a different character (played by Ulli Lommel, the writer/director of the film). The Daily Dot wrote that it is considered to be the worst German film, while n-tv said it was \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". The website filmstarts.de states that Daniel \u2013 Der Zauberer was \"unbearable for non-fans of K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck\", adding that \"the performances of the actors were some of the worst in the history of German cinema\", and alleging that Ulli Lommel and producer Peter Schamoni had \"damaged their reputation\". The film also performed extremely poorly at the box office, having only 13.834 viewers altogether, which led to it being withdrawn from screening at most cinemas within the first week, with RP Online referring to it as a \"super-flop\". It is consistently listed at IMDb's Bottom 100 list and became the lowest rated film at one point. Total Film listed it as the third worst film of all time, after Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 and the direct-to-video animated mockbuster Titanic: The Legend Goes On, and New York Daily News listed it among the seven worst films ever made. In an interview conducted several years after its release, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck admitted that, in retrospect, \"[Y]ou have to say this is the worst movie of all time really\". Filmstarts.de ranked it #4 in its list of the 25 worst movies ever made, and on the German movie rating site Moviepilot.de, it is the lowest-rated film with an average rating of 0.4/10. === Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (2004) === The family-oriented comedy Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was the last film directed by Bob Clark before his death. It is a sequel to the 1999 film Baby Geniuses and like its predecessor, it received negative reviews from film critics, becoming the 6th worst reviewed film of the decade on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% rating. Following the plot of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk', and have knowledge of many secrets. The \"baby geniuses\" become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), a notorious kidnapper of children, who intends to use a satellite system to brainwash the world's population and force them to watch television for the rest of their lives. The film was a box office bomb, only receiving $9 million from its $20 million budget. David Cornelius at efilmcritic wondered \"Why would anyone want to make a follow-up to what is universally viewed as one of the very worst movies ever produced is a mystery for the ages.\" Entertainment Weekly writer Joshua Rivera stated that it was the worst movie he had ever sat through, and Tom Long of The Deseret News said \"It is perhaps the most incompetent and least funny comic film ever made.\" It was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Director (Bob Clark), Worst Supporting Actor (Jon Voight) and Worst Screenplay (Steven Paul (story) & Gregory Poppen). Total Film named it the runner-up to Titanic: The Legend Goes On in its list of the worst films ever made, and Mental Floss selected it as the second worst movie ever made after Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. It also briefly unseated Manos: The Hands of Fate from the top spot on IMDb's bottom 100 list. === Alone in the Dark (2005) === Uwe Boll won a Stinkers Awards for Worst Director and received the Worst Career Achievement award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards Loosely based on a series of video games by Infogrames and directed by Uwe Boll, the German-Canadian-American film Alone in the Dark was panned by critics for a multitude of reasons, including poor script and production values, quick cuts to optimize the gory content, almost no connection to the game, and bad acting. The movie has received a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was included in their Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s at number two. It appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list, and is one of the few films to have received an F rating on CinemaScore.

In 2009, he named it the worst film of the decade. Jeffrey Lyles of The Gazette considered it so bad that \"other legendary bad films ... await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies\", while Scott Nash of Three Movie Buffs dubbed it \"one of the worst movies ever made\".

Total Film included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Amitabh Bachchan, who appeared in the original film and returned for the remake, later admitted that the film was \"a mistake\". === Epic Movie (2007) === Epic Movie is a parody film by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer that mainly parodies epic and fantasy movies, most notably The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the Harry Potter films, but also contains references to all kinds of other then- popular films. Like most works of Frieberg and Seltzer, it received extremely negative reviews, holding an approval rating of 2% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a Metacritic score of 17/100, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Harry Fletcher of the Standard said: \"Filmmakers and trash-peddlers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been responsible for some of the most pointless, lazy and unforgivable movies of the past decade and frankly, they need to be stopped. Disaster Movie, 300 spoof Meet the Spartans and awful Hunger Games mickey-take The Starving Games could easily have made this list of the worst movies ever made, but Epic Movie might be the worst of the lot. It offers the most uninspired, unfunny film pastiches imaginable, sometimes repeating entire sections of dialogue verbatim from the movies they\u2019re supposedly satirising. Nathan Rabin gave it an F score and said, \"Epic Movie [...] strays so far from the solid fundamentals of filmmaking that it calls the very foundation of humor into question.\" Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle said: \"I\u2019ve rarely seen a movie as hostile as this one, both to its audience and to its protagonists, and I don\u2019t think I realized before just how mean-spirited comedy can get (and I was raised on the Three Stooges).\" Jamie Russell of the BBC called it \"the most excruciating, unfunny film you'll see this year\u2026 if not your entire lifetime.\" At the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, it received three nominations, for Worst Remake or Rip-off, Worst Screenplay and Worst Supporting Actress (Carmen Electra). It is included in Empire's and Flavorwire's lists of the 50 worst movies ever made, Standard's list of the 12 worst films ever made, MRQE's 50 worst movies list and Newsweek's list of the 50 worst comedy movies of all time. === I Know Who Killed Me (2007) === I Know Who Killed Me is a psychological thriller film directed by Chris Sivertson and starring Lindsay Lohan as identical twins, one of whom insists her identity is that of another woman after being abducted by a serial killer. At the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, it set a record for most awards won in a single year by winning eight awards and it received two further nominations at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards. The How Did This Get Made? podcast questioned, \"Is this the worst movie Lindsay Lohan has ever been in or flat out the worst movie ever?\" Richard Roeper selected the film as the worst of the 2000s. Gabe Delahaye of Stereogum reviewed I Know Who Killed Me as part of his search for the worst movie ever made, writing that: \"Out of all the possible Worst Movies of All Time so far, none has been as painful to actually watch as I Know Who Killed Me\".

It is included in Empire's and Flavorwire's lists of the 50 worst movies ever made, News.com.au's list of the 15 worst films of all time, Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films and MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.

The film, like most films by Friedberg and Seltzer, received extremely negative reviews, and has a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 73 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Returning to their seemingly bottomless well of flatulence humor, racial stereotypes, and stale pop culture gags, Friedberg and Seltzer have produced what is arguably their worst Movie yet\". It was ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the worst reviewed films of the 2000s. Jason Solomons of The Guardian stated that \"Nothing can convey the grimness of Disaster Movie, which would be the Worst Movie Ever Made were it actually a movie at all.\" Adam Tobias of Watertown Daily Times claimed that \"I just don't see how anyone could not find Disaster Movie one of the worst films of all time.\" Tobias went on to write that the title was appropriate because the film is \"a disaster\".

The British newspaper The People, reviewing The Hottie and the Nottie, claimed \"Paris Hilton is the world's worst actress and she's starring in the worst movie ever made.\" Nathan Lee of The Village Voice called it \"crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny\". Online film critic James Berardinelli described the film's comedy as \"about as funny as the anal rape scene in The War Zone\". Richard Roeper called it \"excruciatingly, painfully, horribly, terribly awful\", and argued that \"nobody in this movie really should have a career in movies\". Connie Ogle in the Miami Herald described The Hottie and the Nottie thus: \"Imagine the worst movie you've ever seen. Got it? Now try to think of something worse. That something is this movie \u2013 wretched, embarrassing and a waste of the time and energy of everyone involved.\" The film appears on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. == 2010s == === Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010) === Bill Corbett, Mike Nelson, and Kevin Murphy during the live Rifftrax of Birdemic An independently produced film that is an apparent homage to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, Birdemic: Shock and Terror tells the story of a romance between the two leading characters, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, as their small town is attacked by birds (which do not appear until 47 minutes into the film). Written, directed, and produced by James Nguyen, it was intended as a \"romantic thriller\" but is notable due to its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting, bad dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and, in particular, its special effects, consisting primarily of poorly rendered computer generated eagles and vultures that perform physically awkward aerial maneuvers and explode upon impact with the ground. The film, which cost $10,000 to make, was called by the Huffington Post \"truly, one of the worst films ever made\" and by The Village Voice as \"one more in the pantheon of beloved trash-terpieces\". Flavorwire ranked it #1 in its list of the 50 worst films ever made. Slate deemed it among the worst movies ever made, while Salon referred to it as \"a cult hit among bad-movie fans\" and Variety stated that the film displayed \"all the revered hallmarks of hilariously bad filmmaking\". Following the home media release of Birdemic, Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through Rifftrax. They later riffed upon the film again theatrically. In response to the cult status of the first film, a sequel\u2014Birdemic 2: The Resurrection\u2014was released in 2013, and included many returning members of the cast and crew.Birdemic 2: The Resurrection (2013) - IMDbFilm Review: \u2018Birdemic 2: The Resurrection\u2019 - Variety === The Last Airbender (2010) === The Last Airbender was panned for its plot holes, bad acting, poor special effects, directing, post-converted 3-D, and the casting of white and Indian actors to portray East Asian or Inuit characters, being accused of whitewashing The Last Airbender is a fantasy/adventure film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and is based on the Nicktoon animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Upon release, the film received extremely negative reviews, with critics panning the bad acting, numerous plot holes, screenplay, poor special effects (despite its reported $150 million budget), and especially Shyamalan's directing. It was also ridiculed for the poor quality of its post-converted 3-D, and the casting of white and Indian actors to portray characters who were East Asian or Inuit in the source material triggered accusations of racism and whitewashing. Further criticism came from fans of the original cartoon series, who said the film differed tremendously from its critically acclaimed source material. David Onda of Comcast wrote that it \"has been called one of the worst ever made. The movie was universally panned by critics and failed to make back its production budget domestically.\" It garnered nine nominations at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five, including Worst Picture and Worst Director. Roger Ebert wrote, \"The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.\" When asked if Last Airbender had been the worst film he has ever seen, Mike Ryan of Vanity Fair answered, \"Yes\". Hi highlighted the film in their \"Worst Films Ever\" series, and Screen Rant and Digital Trends included it in their worst film lists. Dev Patel would later express regret and dislike for his role and his experience with the film. He described his performance as Prince Zuko as being as though he \u201csaw a stranger on the screen that I couldn\u2019t relate to.\u201d === Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star (2011) === Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star was produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions and featured Nick Swardson in the titular role as a small-town manchild who pursues a career in the pornographic film industry after learning that his parents were porn stars in the 1970s. On Rotten Tomatoes, Bucky Larson has a 3% rating, based on 36 reviews. Linda Cook of the Quad-City Times described the film as \"the worst of the worst\", while hollywoodchicago.com called it \"one of the worst comedies of all time\".

Screen Rant included it in its list of the 25 worst movies in film history and Mental Floss named it the fifth worst movie ever. Bucky Larson also appears on MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list, and Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films.

Jack and Jill is a comedy film starring Adam Sandler as Jack, a commercial director, who is visited by his \"identical\" twin sister, Jill (played by Sandler, in drag), during the holidays. Salon stated that Jack and Jill \"received some of the worst reviews of any movie ever\" upon its release. In the film, Jill is wooed by Al Pacino, whom Jack wants to be in his Dunkin' Donuts commercial. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times noted the irony of Pacino's presence, as the actor is best known for playing Michael Corleone in The Godfather, which is widely considered one of the best films ever made, in this film, which he called \"one of the worst movies in the history of cinema!\" Ramin Setoodeh of The Daily Beast and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone reviewed it together in an article entitled \"Adam Sandler's 'Jack and Jill' Is the Worst Movie Ever Made\". After an hour-long critique, RedLetterMedia claimed that it was \"so egregious that it ceased to be a film\", and the site also later called it \"the worst thing in the world\". Mike McGranaghan wrote, on his website The Aisle Seat: \"Howard the Duck, Gigli, Showgirls, From Justin to Kelly. What do they all have in common? They're all widely considered among the worst big studio movies ever made. You know what else they have in common? They're all better than Jack and Jill.\" Jack and Jill won a record 10 awards at the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, sweeping every category. It broke the record previously held by Battlefield Earth for having the most Razzies earned by a single film and is the only film to win every possible award. The film holds a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 110 reviews. === That's My Boy (2012) === Another comedy film starring Adam Sandler, That's My Boy concerns a middle school student named Donny Berger who has sex with his teacher, gets her pregnant, and in turn, earns a lifestyle of a minor celebrity, something he never intended to happen. Years later, Donny (played by Sandler) crashes his now-adult son's (Andy Samberg) wedding and bachelor party to get his money so he can pay his taxes, therefore avoiding prison. The film has been widely panned due to its comedic portrayal of incest, hebephilia, statutory rape, and gerontophilia, with film critic Andrew O'Hehir of Salon stating, \"[Sandler's] new movie about a rape survivor and his estranged son is supposed to be funny, but radiates pain and rage.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times proclaimed, \"To say That's My Boy is one of the worst movies of the year is to insult 2012. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen\", while Richard Haridly of Quickflix called it \"one of the saddest and most exhausting\" films he has ever seen. MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher outright panned the film for its inability to generate laughs as well as its depraved content, calling it \"a disgusting excuse for a comedy\" and possibly \"the most repulsive movie I've ever seen\", and Jonathan Lack of We Got This Covered declared, \"That's My Boy isn't just the worst film of 2012, it's one of the most morally reprehensible comedies of all time, a disgusting movie you should stay far, far away from.\" Furthermore, Ed Whitfield of The Ooh Tray stated, \"It may be the worst film, in any genre, ever made\". In addition to the movie's overwhelmingly negative reviews, That's My Boy earned eight nominations at the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards, such as Worst Picture and Worst Director, and won the awards for Worst Actor (Sandler) and Worst Screenplay. It holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 115 reviews. === Run for Your Wife (2012) === A British comedy film based on the stage farce of the same name, Run for Your Wife starred Danny Dyer as John Smith, a bigamist, and Denise van Outen and Sarah Harding as his wives.

Several critics have called it one of the worst films ever made, including Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, who said \"There's just one use for Movie 43, apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later. It provides me with a handy new answer to a question I'm often asked: 'What's the worst film you've ever seen? Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News also considered it the worst movie she ever saw. Brady Murphy of Murphy Reviews wrote, \"A world where a film like this can exist only reminds me of the other contemptible acts performed by human kind since the dawn of time, and is rather eye-opening in that respect. That probably wasn't intentional, though\"; he went on to say that \"The idea that anyone could think that this would be in any way humorous is simply unbelievable.\" He concluded his review by saying the movie \"had no heart\", and gave it the site's first zero out of ten rating. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times voiced similar hatred, calling it \"aggressively tasteless\" and \"the Citizen Kane of awful\". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post stated, \"If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous Howard the Duck, Gigli, Ishtar and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing Movie 43.\" Movie 43 is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.

It's disturbing to see such an atrocious, regressive, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic cinematic product force-fed to paying audiences. I can understand that a comedy need not be 'safe', but what goes on in Humshakals is simply too horrifying to bear.\" Saurabh Dwivedi of India Today stated \"I can only say that Humshakals will be listed in one of the worst films of the century.\" Writing in Emirates 24/7, Sneha May Francis said that it succeeded Khan's previous endeavor, Himmatwala, in becoming the worst Bollywood film ever.

Gazeta.ru described it as \"probably the worst film in the history of Russian cinema\". Mail.Ru said it was the worst remake, while critic Maxim Shilimanov wrote that \"The film is so bad that it seems that it was shot badly on purpose so that film critics had something to write about.\" In listing it as one of the worst remakes of Soviet cinema, Cosmopolitan Russia opted to quote from a user review from KinoPoisk that called it \"the worst film I've ever seen\" rather than describe the plot. It is the lowest rated film on KinoPoisk, appears on review aggregator Kritikanstvo's all-time lowest-scoring films, and RIA Novosti listed it as the second worst film after Guardians. === Saving Christmas (2014) === Kirk Cameron's plea for fans to support Saving Christmas backfired, resulting in it being the lowest rated film on IMDb Saving Christmas is a faith-based Christmas comedy film starring Kirk Cameron, who plays a fictionalized version of himself attempting to convince his brother- in-law (played by the film's director, Darren Doane) that Christmas is still a Christian holiday.

This resulted in a backlash in which Internet users traveled to the Rotten Tomatoes page and condemned the film. Three weeks after its release, Saving Christmas became the lowest-rated film on IMDb's bottom 100 list. Cameron blamed the low rating on a Reddit campaign by \"haters and atheists\" to purposely lower the film's ratings.

United Passions was accused of ignoring these long-running claims. London Evening Standards Des Kelly wrote that United Passions was \"the worst movie ever made\" and \"the most extraordinary vanity exercise; a vile, self-aggrandizing, sugar-coated pile of manure where Blatter and Co. manage to make North Korea's Kim Jong-un look self-effacing\".Sugar-coated FIFA film is spreading around Europe like a virus Des Kelly, London Evening Standard, 27 October 2014.

Several of the people involved in United Passions later expressed regret over the film. Director Auburtin called United Passions \"a disaster\" and added: \"Now I'm seen as bad as the guy who brought AIDS to Africa or the guy who caused the financial crisis ... apparently I am a propaganda guy making films for corrupt people.\" Tim Roth apologized for taking part in the film and admitted that he took the job in United Passions for the money.

Bumstead Award during the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, a special category for critical and financial failures that were not given an eligible release. ===Dirty Grandpa (2016)=== Dirty Grandpa, a 2016 comedy film starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron as a grandfather and grandson going to Florida during Spring break, received negative reviews for its gross-out and shock humor that was also considered as sexist, homophobic and racist.

Dirty Grandpa, is not just the worst movie [De Niro] has ever been in, but it may be the worst movie anyone has ever been in.\" Glenn McDonald of Indy Week said: \"The awful, ugly Dirty Grandpa is the comedy equivalent of torture porn ... In fact, in the dizzying moments after being bludgeoned by this miserable specimen, I was convinced it's among the worst movies ever made.\" Richard Roeper gave the film zero stars, writing, \"If Dirty Grandpa isn't the worst movie of 2016, I have some serious cinematic torture in my near future.\" On his YouTube channel, Roeper also said: \"I'm not ready to say Dirty Grandpa is the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'm also not ready to say it's not the worst movie I've ever seen.\" Mark Kermode, on his BBC Radio 5 Live show (Kermode and Mayo's Film Review), said that he found the film \"truly, genuinely horrible\" and went on to say, \"after Dirty Grandpa I did feel genuinely unclean, I wanted to go and have a shower, because it's just so revolting. Somewhere in hell there is a multiplex playing this on a double bill, with Movie 43 and Entourage.\" He would later go on to brand it his least favorite film of 2016. Glenn Kelly of RogerEbert.com said: \"The actor Bela Lugosi appeared in some landmark, perhaps even great, films at the beginning of his Hollywood career in the 1930s. ... Lugosi's final film was 1959's Plan 9 from Outer Space, frequently cited as the worst film ever made. The cinematic landmarks of De Niro's career include films such as Coppola's The Godfather Part II and Scorsese's Raging Bull. He has been featured in a good number of very bad films in the years since. But this? This might just be his own Plan 9\". The film has an approval rating of 11% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 2.76/10, while on Metacritic it has a score of 21 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".

It was criticized for having a derivative plot, bad acting and direction, cheap CGI, plot holes and overall low quality. Kg-portal.ru wrote that \"Guardians is a film from which Russian cinema should be protected. It's like a sequel to Plan 9 from Outer Space, filmed by Uwe Boll, with the screenplay by Tommy Wiseau and with him in the lead role\". Rossiyskaya Gazeta commented that the film was \"Worse than you can imagine.\" Meduza compared the film's director, Sarik Andreasyan, to Plan 9 from Outer Spaces director, Ed Wood, and said that Guardians \"is a convincing answer to the eternal question of why we can never catch up with Hollywood even in our own box office\". Afisha said that it was the Russian answer to Howard the Duck, and Ivi, Inc. commented that \"a more talentless film is hard to imagine\". RIA Novosti placed it at the top of their worst film list, and it appears on Kritikanstvo's all-time lowest-scoring films. Critics outside of Russia generally panned the film but were not as harsh, as it has a 30% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews. A sequel was planned, but the film was a box office bomb, which resulted in the film's production company, Enjoy Movies, subsequently filing for bankruptcy, and the Cinema Foundation of Russia, which provided part of the budget, suing the company and demanding a return of the investment. === Iron Sky: The Coming Race (2019) === Iron Sky: The Coming Race is a Finnish-German comic science fiction action film and the sequel to 2012 film Iron Sky. The plot follows a group of nuclear holocaust survivors living in an abandoned Nazi base on the far side of the Moon.

Reviews of film were generally very negative. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 29%, based on 7 reviews. Sophie Monks Kaufman of The Guardian gave the film one out of five stars, calling it a \u201dscattershot, stakes-free, self-consciously wacky space comedy\u201d. She criticized its unidimensional characters and superficial script, noting a tendency to introduce illogical elements with little relation to the rest of the plot, seemingly for the sake of sheer surrealness. Noel Murray of Los Angeles Times called The Coming Race a \u201dgoofy science-fiction picture\u201d and \u201dfrustratingly unfocused\u201d both as a story and as a commentary of the modern era. Just the same, he found the hollow Earth sequence \u201dsuitably wacky\u201d. Samantha Nelson, writing for The Verge, said that the storyline offers \"plenty of opportunities for spectacle\" and comedic commentary of film tropes, and the special effects show significant improvement over those in the first film, however, The Coming Race\u2019s high-speed plot prevents it from giving necessary focus on any single theme. On 13 October 2020 was reported that the production company behind Iron Sky franchise has been filed for bankruptcy mainly because of its very poor results of box office. ===Cats (2019)=== EW.com] Cats is an American film adaptation of the popular musical penned by Andrew Lloyd Webber (based on the works of T.S.
