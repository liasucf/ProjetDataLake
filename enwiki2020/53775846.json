    "text": "A Prayer Before Dawn is a 2017 biographical martial arts film directed by Jean-St\u00e9phane Sauvaire, written by Jonathan Hirschbein and Nick Saltrese and starring Joe Cole. It is based on the book A Prayer Before Dawn: My Nightmare in Thailand's Prisons by Billy Moore. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on 19 May 2017. It was released in the United Kingdom on 20 July 2018, by Altitude Film Distribution, and in the United States on 10 August 2018, by A24. ==Plot== Billy Moore, a young British boxer and troubled heroin addict, is arrested in Thailand and charged with possession of stolen goods and a firearm. Incarcerated into Klong Prem prison, he is quickly subjugated to the horrors of Thai prison life, including being moved into a crowded mass cell ruled by cell boss Keng, forced to sleep next to a corpse and witnessing at knifepoint the rape of a fellow inmate. Billy\u2019s experiences with the other prisoners and personnel are tense, at one point going into a violent frenzy and biting into the neck of a prison guard after being refused painkillers. Following his punishment, he attempts to befriend transgender prisoner Fame. Life in prison worsens for Billy, and he retreats into heavy drug abuse; he subsequently beats two Muslim chefs half to death after being bribed ya ba by a corrupt prison guard. Billy\u2019s psyche finally breaks and he attempts suicide by slitting his wrist, though he survives. With a desperate need to fight again and battle his demons, he eventually joins the boxing team with the help of Fame, whom he later develops a romance with. Billy quickly adapts to the art of Muay Thai kickboxing and is able to win his first bout in a close back-and-forth brawl. Impressed by his performance, prison warden Officer Preecha has him transferred into the boxing team cell, with him being the first foreigner to compete in the national Muay Thai tournament and represent the prison. There he soon develops a comradery with the other boxers, receiving a tattoo on his back. However, he is ambushed by Keng and his gang, who threaten him with a pin prick attack if he loses the tournament. Even worse, it is established that Billy is suffering from hernia due to his drug abuse, and any subsequent damage could result in serious internal bleeding. Regardless, he still desires to compete. The resulting match is gruelling for Billy, as he takes multiple shots to his stomach and is also fouled by his opponent. However, using what he learnt, he manages to knock his opponent out with a spinning back elbow and wins the fight. Despite the victory, the physical trauma is too much, and Billy ends up vomiting blood and passing out. Billy is quickly rushed to hospital, and after waking up, he sneaks out of the building and into the cityscape. Billy soon reconsiders his actions and returns back to the hospital. After being transferred, he meets his father (played by the real Billy Moore) and the two exchange a solemn smile. End credits reveal that after serving three years, Billy Moore was transferred to a UK prison and released on an amnesty by the King of Thailand in October 2010. Since his release, he has devoted his life to working with other addicts and fighting to maintain his own recovery. ==Cast== * Joe Cole as Billy Moore * Pornchanok Mabklang as Fame * Panya Yimmumphai as Keng * Somluck Kamsing as Trainer * Vithaya Pansringarm as Officer Preecha * Billy Moore as Billy's Father ==Production== In October 2014, it was announced Charlie Hunnam would star in the film, with Jean-St\u00e9phane Sauvaire directing from a screenplay written by Jonathan Hirschbein and Nick Saltrese, based upon a memoir written by Billy Moore.
