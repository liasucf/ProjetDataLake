    "text": "Sztutowo () is a village in Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski County, part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland. It is located about 38 km (24 mi) east of Gda\u0144sk on the northeastern edge of the Vistula Delta, at the base of the Vistula Spit on the Baltic coast. At the beginning of World War II, the Nazi Germans established the Stutthof concentration camp in the town, which soon developed into a huge complex of 40 subcamps across numerous locations, with as many as 100,000 people incarcerated there from all of Europe, and more than 85,000 victims. == History == Sztutowo has been known since the beginning of the 13th century as a fishing settlement in the Pomerelian region. A day's journey from Gda\u0144sk (Danzig) on the Hanseatic post road to K\u00f6nigsberg, it was conquered by the Teutonic Knights in 1308. It eventually came under the control of the Dukes of Eastern Pomerania. A coaching inn and stud farm were founded in 1432 to provide refreshment and fresh horses for the coaches, and the settlement developed into a village. After the Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466, the village became part of the autonomous Polish province of Royal Prussia. At that time an estate and manor were founded in Sztutowo, and an agrarian settlement developed nearby. It is recorded that Tsar Peter the Great of Russia stayed in Sztutowo in 1716. The village was annexed by King Frederick the Great of Prussia in 1772 during the First Partition of Poland. A later lessee of the manor was the father of the German pessimist philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, who spent the first five years of his life there (born 1788 in Danzig). As Stutthof, the village became part of the German Empire upon the Prussian-led unification of Germany in 1871. After the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I, the village became part of the territory of the Free City of Danzig in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. === World War II === At the beginning of World War II in 1939, the Nazis (Germans) built the Stutthof concentration camp nearby, which received its first prisoners on September 2 of that year. The camp eventually developed into a huge complex with branches throughout northern Poland by the time it was liberated in May 1945 by the Red Army. More than 110,000 persons of twenty-five nationalities from nineteen countries were imprisoned, and it is estimated that more than 85,000 of them perished here. Located to the west of the current village, the site is now a Polish national museum. == Economy == Sztutowo is an agricultural, fishing, and tourist center, with numerous guest houses, spas, campgrounds, and recreational facilities. It has numerous seaside activities and a close proximity to a Polish national nature preserve and bird sanctuary.
