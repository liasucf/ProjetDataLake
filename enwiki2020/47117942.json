    "text": "The CSR EMU is a series of electric multiple unit cars manufactured by CSR Corporation Limited for use on Buenos Aires' commuter rail network.Broad-gauge Suburban EMU - CSR Corporation Limited The trains operate on three of the city's lines as of 2015 and 705 cars were manufactured, with each line using a different number of cars per train. They were created for use on lines electrified using both third rail and overhead lines. ==Background== A Toshiba EMU on the Sarmiento Line before the purchase of the CSR trains. By 2013, the rolling stock of Buenos Aires' commuter rail network was ageing and deteriorating rapidly. At the same time, high-profile accidents in Flores and Once in previous years had led the national government to revise the concession-based railway privatisation, which was largely blamed for the deterioration of the network.\"El gobierno nacional estatiz\u00f3 los ferrocarriles Sarmiento y Mitre\", Infobae The government thus decided to intervene, revoking concessions to companies such as Trenes de Buenos Aires and setting up Trenes Argentinos to manage the lines.\"Nueva empresa estatal para el Belgrano Cargas\", P\u00e1gina/12, 23 May 2013 This was followed by a series of rolling stock purchases from China CNR Corporation and CSR Corporation Limited (and later some Argentine companies) to replace trains on both diesel and rail segments. For the electrified lines, CSR won the contract to provide the electric multiple units, and an order was placed in January 2013 for 405 cars for the Mitre and Sarmiento lines, with another order for 300 cars for the Roca Line signed in August of that same year.Decreto 9/2013 - Ministerio del Interior, 10 January 2013.Decisi\u00f3n Administrativa 584/2013 - Ministerio del Interior, 15 August 2013. The acquisition of the CSR rolling stock was also accompanied by a series of works on all three lines, both to accommodate the new trains such as with the electrification of the Buenos Aires - La Plata segment on the Roca Line, but also general improvements.Adjudican la \u00faltima parte de la electrificaci\u00f3n del ferrocarril que une Constituci\u00f3n con La Plata - InfoBAE, 5 February 2015. On top of the emergency improvements undertaken following the Once Tragedy,Arranca un plan de obras atrasadas en el tren Mitre - Clarin, 10 August 2012. some of these improvements included the modernisation of stations, raising the height of platforms to match the new trains, incorporating train protection systems, creating new underpasses and rail infrastructure improvements, some of which were also undertaken by the City of Buenos Aires.Randazzo anunci\u00f3 avances en la renovaci\u00f3n del Mitre - Sala de Prensa de la Republica Argentina, 16 January 2014.Comenzaron a funcionar seis de los nuevos trenes chinos del Sarmiento - Clarin, 21 July 2014Obras que alivian la circulaci\u00f3n, unen barrios y evitan accidentes - Buenos Aires Ciudad, 23 June 2015. However, not all works were finished by the time the CSR EMUs arrived on their respective lines, and some works continued on while they were already functioning.Los nuevos trenes del Roca arrancan el 8 de junio - EnElSubte, 22 May 2015. A further 200 cars were purchased for the Roca Line in 2017 to replace the aging Toshiba EMUs which had exceeded their 30-year lifespan. ==Overview== Passengers aboard a Roca Line train. The units were built at CSR's Qingdao factory, a large complex with 1,640,000 m2 of covered space.Los trenes que se vienen desde China - Pagina/12, 23 September 2013. The total cost for the 709 cars was $841 million, which also included R&D; as well as shipping, or $1.09 million to $1.27 million per car depending on the line, which was noted as being significantly below market prices. In 2014, CSR then purchased the Argentine rolling stock manufacturer Emprendimientos Ferroviarios, in part to establish a place in Argentina to maintain the trains once they were in operation.Company Overview of Emprendimientos Ferroviarios S.A. Emfer S.A. - Bloomberg BusinessCSR adquiere EMFER y desembarca en la Argentina - EnElSubte, 26 February 2014. The trains have a series of features in line with modern rolling stock, such as ABS, air conditioning, CCTV, a train protection system and intelligent doors, while numerous components such as the brakes and traction system were sourced from countries such as Germany, Sweden and Japan.Randazzo expuso sobre la recuperaci\u00f3n ferroviaria en Argentina. - Trenes Argentinosa Cargas y Logistica, 24 September 2014.Los nuevos trenes de la l\u00ednea Sarmiento comenzar\u00e1n a funcionar el lunes - La Nacion, 16 July 2014. There are very minor differences with the Roca Line trains, and the most major difference is the overhead collection which runs at a different voltage. The trains began to arrive in February 2014, just 13 months after the order was signed.Presentaron los nuevos vagones chinos de la l\u00ednea Sarmiento - InfoBAE, 26 February 2014. ==Usage== A Mitre Line train at Rivadavia station. The electric multiple units are used on all of Buenos Aires' electrified commuter rail lines, with the exception of the Urquiza Line which uses Japanese Toshiba EMUs.Historia - Metrovias The Belgrano Sur line had diesel multiple units with a similar appearance to the CSR electric multiple units purchased, which began arriving in the country in 2015.Presentaron los trenes 0 km de la l\u00ednea Belgrano Sur: llegar\u00e1n al pa\u00eds en junio - La Nacion, 20 April 2015. The San Mart\u00edn Line also saw new rolling stock from CSR, but in the form of CSR SDD7 diesel-electric locomotives, while the Belgrano Norte line has seen the incorporation of Argentine-built EMEPA DMUs.Los nuevos trenes chinos en el San Mart\u00edn - La Nacion, 26 October 2013.

In the case of the Mitre and Sarmiento lines, the CSR EMUs make up the entirety of the electric rolling stock, while diesel segments such as the Victoria - Capilla del Se\u00f1or route on the Mitre Line are managed by Argentine-built Materfer CMM 400-2 DMUs.Incorporan nuevos trenes y servicios en el Victoria \u2013 Capilla - EnElSubte, 13 April 2015. The first Roca Line trains began arriving in 2015, continuing to arrive throughout the year, and began to be integrated in June of that year, however these will serve alongside the existing Toshiba rolling stock purchased in 1985 in this case.Avanza la obra de electrificaci\u00f3n del Roca - EnElSubte, 18 June 2015.
