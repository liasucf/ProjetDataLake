It was completed in 1974 with the headquarters of Security Pacific National Bank, Capital Group Companies and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton as its main tenants. The tower is the fifth tallest building in Los Angeles, and the 92nd-tallest building in the United States. In 2009 it had the highest assessed value of any office building in Los Angeles County. When it was constructed, Security Pacific Plaza was unique for Downtown Los Angeles, in that its four sides each faced true north, south, east and west. From when it opened in 1974 until 1992, it bore the Security Pacific Bank logo. This logo was removed when Bank of America acquired Security Pacific Bank. Featured in several motion pictures, its plaza area was filmed as that of the adjacent \"Peerless Building\" to the Glass Tower in The Towering Inferno (which was set in San Francisco), as well as the lawyer's office in the film Pretty Woman, and as Tex Richman's office headquarters in The Muppets. The tower was also used in establishing shots as the headquarters for the fictional company Denver- Carrington in the 1991 prime time soap opera \u2018\u2019Dynasty\u2019\u2019. The building site is situated on that features a formal garden with over 200 trees and three waterfalls. In front of the main entrance is the \"Four Arches\" sculpture by Alexander Calder. ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles *List of tallest buildings in the United States ==References== Category:Bank of America buildings Category:Bank buildings in California Category:Buildings and structures in Downtown Los Angeles Category:Bunker Hill, Los Angeles Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Los Angeles Category:Brookfield Properties buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in California Category:1970s architecture in the United States Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certified buildings ",
