The series premiered on the Discovery Channel on May 6, 2014. Filmed on location near Hoonah, Alaska and Chichagof Island, with later seasons filmed on location in Okanogan County, Washington, it follows the extended Brown family's life. Although purportedly a genuine reality TV show, it is criticized for being scripted and/or fake. In April 2019, Radar Online learned that the show has been renewed for a 10th season, although specific dates are not yet known. On November 13, the show was renewed for season 11 which premiered on December 4, 2019. Season 12 premiered on August 23, 2020.

Billy has a criminal history of horse theft in 1980.El Paso County Texas District Clerk, April 14, 1980 Ami has a criminal history of welfare fraud.State of Alaska Dept of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Division, October 12, 1993 ==Residency issues== On October 3, 2014, following an investigation by the Alaska Department of Revenue, a Juneau grand jury indicted the Browns with 60 counts of first-degree unsworn falsification regarding Permanent Fund Dividend forms for their residency and first- and second-degree theft that took place between 2009 and 2012. Billy was charged with 24 of those counts, which occurred from 2010 to 2013 as well as for the theft of more than $21,000 in dividend money for himself and others. The charges meant that the state believed the family spent more than 180 days a year living outside of Alaska and lied about it on their applications. On November 18, 2015, Billy and Joshua struck a plea deal for the whole family except Matt and Rain (Matt wasn't living there and didn't file and Rain was too young). They pled guilty for the rest of the family for lying on PFD forms. Billy and Joshua's punishment for stealing over $21,000 dollars was restitution, fines and 30 days of house arrest at a Juneau hotel. ==References== Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2014 American television series debuts Category:Discovery Channel original programming Category:Television shows set in Alaska ",
