    "text": "\"This Is Mine\" is a song by the British new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in 1984 as the second single from their third studio album How Men Are. It was written by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware, and produced by Marsh and Greg Walsh. The song reached No. 23 in the UK, remaining in the charts for seven weeks. It would be the band's last Top 30 single until 1992's \"Temptation (Brothers In Rhythm Remix)\" A music video was filmed to promote the single, which featured the band robbing a bank. Gregory and Ware crack open the safe and escape in a van driven by Marsh. The video ends with Gregory in a helicopter throwing money into a river. ==Critical reception== Aaron Badgley of AllMusic stated \"\"Sunset Now\", \"Flamedown\" and the brilliant \"This Is Mine\" are just a few of the reasons for this album's greatness.\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"This Is Mine\" - 3:20 #\"Skin\" - 3:40 ;12\" single #\"This Is Mine (Filmix)\" - 7:18 #\"This Is Mine (Cinemix)\" - 8:55 #\"Skin\" - 3:40 ;12\" single (UK release) #\"This Is Mine (Extended version)\" - 5:39 #\"Skin\" - 3:39 #\"Mine\" - 5:04 ;12\" single (US promo) #\"This Is Mine (Filmix)\" - 7:18 #\"This Is Mine (Radio version)\" - 3:20 #\"This Is Mine (Cinemix)\" - 7:25 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1984) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|23 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Dance/Club Play Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |} ==Personnel== ;Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory - lead vocals, backing vocals * Martyn Ware - synthesizer (Roland System 100 Bass), backing vocals, LinnDrum programming, producer * Ian Craig Marsh - synthesizer (Fairlight, Roland System 100) ;Additional personnel * Greg Walsh - synthesizer (Roland System 100 Bass), Fairlight programming, producer * Don Myrick - saxophone (tenor solo) * Michael Harris - flugelhorn * The Phenix Horns Esquire - horns * Mike Prior - photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:1984 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh Category:1984 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Arista Records singles ",
