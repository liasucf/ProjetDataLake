He was elected fellow of St John's in 1540, but moved to Queens' later that year. He was successively bursar and dean of Queens', culminating in becoming vice-president in 1551, and was five times vice-chancellor of the university. Scurrilous Puritans said he had once been the homosexual lover of John Whitgift, later Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he went to live in old age at Lambeth Palace.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided, London, 2005 But he owes his notoriety to his remarkable versatility, and, like the Vicar of Bray, he was always faithful to the national religion, whatever it might be. A weathervane he donated with his initials of AP was said to have swung between 'A Papist','A Protestant', and 'A Puritan', depending on which way the wind blew.Diarmaid MacCulloch, op. cit., p.209. In April 1547 he advocated Catholic doctrines, but recanted two months later, and his Protestant faith was strengthened during Edward VI's reign; he was appointed a royal chaplain and canon of Windsor. Soon after Mary's accession, however, he perceived the error of his ways and was made Master of Peterhouse in 1553 and Dean of Ely in 1557. He preached the sermon in 1557 when the bodies of Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius were disinterred in Cambridge and burnt for heresy, and also, remarkably, in 1560 when these proceedings were reversed and the dead heretics were rehabilitated. In Elizabeth's reign he subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles, denounced the pope and tried to convert Abbot Feckenham to Protestantism; and in 1584 Whitgift in vain recommended him for a bishopric. He was selected as the type of Anglican prelate by the authors of the Martin Marprelate tracts and other Puritans, who nicknamed him \"Old Andrew Turncoat\", \"Andrew Ambo\", \"Old Father Palinode\". Cambridge wits, it was said, translated \"perno\" by \"I turn, I rat, I change often\"; and a coat that had often been turned was said to have been \"perned\". Historian Alice Hogge recounts an episode in which a close friend asked Perne \"to tell her honestly and simply which was the holy religion that see her safe to heaven\". Perne replied that, if she wished, she could live in the religion which the Queen (Elizabeth I) and the kingdom professed \u2013 Anglicanism \u2013 \"but don't die in it. Die in faith and communion with the Catholic Church, that is, if you want to save your soul\". As Hogge notes wryly, he never had the chance to follow his own advice, dying suddenly on the way back to his room after dining \u2013 and \"in the headquarters of that faith [Anglicanism], Lambeth Palace itself\".Hogge, Alice (2005) God's Secret Agents London: Harper Collins, 36\u20137 On his death, he bequeathed the greater part of his library to Peterhouse, where he had been Master, together with the funds to house it in what is now the Perne Library there. ==Notes== ==References== Attribution: * ==External links== Category:1510s births Category:1589 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:16th-century English clergy Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge Category:Masters of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:Deans of Ely Category:Canons of Windsor Category:16th-century English educators ",
