    "text": "\"My Kind of Love\" is a song recorded by Scottish recording artist Emeli Sand\u00e9 for her debut studio album, Our Version of Events (2012). It was released on 8 June 2012 as the album's fourth single and would go on to become a top-twenty hit on the UK Singles Chart. A year after its first release, in August 2013, It was announced that \"My Kind of Love\" would serve as the second single for the American market, after \"Next to Me\" was released as the album's first single. A brand new music video for the American release began production in mid-August. ==Background== While many media outlets slated \"Where I Sleep\" to be released the fourth single, \"My Kind of Love\" was announced as the fourth single from the album on 18 April 2012. The track was written by Sand\u00e9, Emile Haynie and Danny Keyz, whilst production of the song was completed by Haynie, Daniel \"Danny Keyz\" Tannenbaum and Craze & Hoax. It is the only song on the album to have been produced by more than one producer. \"My Kind of Love\" is an R&B; song that draws from the soul genre. On 6 May 2012, Sand\u00e9 performed \"My Kind of Love\" on the first series of The Voice UK, during the second live show. ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"My Kind of Love\" was first released onto YouTube on 20 April 2012 at a total length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. The video was directed by British music video director Dawn Shadforth. Former Skins star Laya Lewis features in the clip alongside Sand\u00e9. In the video, Sand\u00e9 enters a hospital to visit a childhood friend who appears to be suffering severely with cancer and is close to death. When she finds her friend, who appears to be extremely depressed, she gives her a pink wig to wear as the cancer has taken her hair. After helping her to get dressed Sand\u00e9 takes her from the hospital, unbeknownst to the doctors, to take her to the seafront amusements in Hastings to make the last of her days the best she's ever had. Sand\u00e9 also takes her to a park, intercut with scenes of them there when they were young. The video ends with Sand\u00e9 and her friend sitting on a hill above the seaside town and her sitting a hospital corridor, seemingly having taken her friend back. An alternative interpretation is that Sand\u00e9 and the woman being hospitalized are in a same- gender relationship, as hinted by the photograph taken of both of them as adults, as opposed to children. Sand\u00e9 goes to a hospital to comfort her partner with a pink wig, a car ride, and then a merry-go-round ride. On 25 July 2013, she filmed a second video, for the single's RedOne and Alex P Remix, which she uploaded to her VEVO account on 5 September 2013. It features different, interspersed stories depicting conflict, with bullets representing hurtful words: the first is about a couple fighting, the next is about a little girl whose horse is old and that her father wants to put down, and the third is a young man who struggles with being different and being insulted by a group of hecklers for not wanting to join in with the crowd. There are also scenes of the aftermath of the conflicts, with the couple appearing to have reconciled, the little girl riding her horse, and the young man turning to his art to express himself. Meanwhile, Sand\u00e9 is seen in a room where fog surrounds her and rain falls down on her as she sings. The video was Directed by Sanji and the Cinematographer was Eric Wycoff. ==Track listing== *;Digital EPhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/my-kind-of-love-remixes-ep/id526057982 # \"My Kind of Love\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:19 # \"My Kind of Love\" (Live from Hollywood) \u2013 3:46 # \"My Kind of Love\" (Gemini Remix) \u2013 4:19 # \"My Kind of Love\" (Machinedrum Remix) \u2013 5:43 # \"My Kind of Love\" (Wideboys Remix) \u2013 6:30 *;Digital download \u2013 Remix # \"My Kind of Love\" (RedOne and Alex P remix) \u2013 4:24 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2012\u201314) !Peak position |- | Australia (ARIA) | align=\"center\"| 60 |- |- |- | Greece Digital Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2012) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|97 |} ===Certifications=== == Cover versions == * On 11 November 2013, Tessanne Chin covered the song on Season 5 of NBC's singing competition, The Voice for the Live Top 12 round. ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Release date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland | 8 June 2012 | rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download | rowspan=\"2\"| Virgin Records |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | 10 June 2012 |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| United States | 5 August 2013 | Hot AC radio | rowspan=\"3\"| Capitol Records |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 10 September 2013 | Digital download |- | Mainstream radio |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Emeli Sand\u00e9 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:2012 singles Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Soul ballads Category:Songs written by Emeli Sand\u00e9 Category:Song recordings produced by Emile Haynie Category:Songs written by Emile Haynie Category:2011 songs ",
