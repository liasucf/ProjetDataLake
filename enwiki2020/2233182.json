    "text": "Yu So-chow (; 9 July 1930 \u2013 12 May 2017) was a Chinese actress. She was born in Beijing to a Peking opera family. She is the daughter of late Master Yu Jim Yuen who ran the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School in Hong Kong, and teacher of many well-known actors. She started her acting career in 1948 and made over 240 films in the wuxia, kung fu, action, detective and Cantonese opera genres. Her films were successful at the box-office and she was one of the most popular superstars of the 1960 in Asia and Hong Kong. ==Career== Yu learned Peking Opera at the age of eight and made her stage debut at the age of nine. She specialized in playing female warrior roles in which she could skillfully demonstrate her footwork by continuously juggling and kicking back twelve red-tasselled tuo shou (\u812b\u624b) spears, as seen in one of her famous stage Peking operas, The White Snake (\u767d\u86c7\u50b3), and in the 1951 film Amazon on the Sea (\u6d77\u4e0a\u5973\u9738\u738b). Her first movie was made in 1948. She was one of the three actresses in the 1950s who really knew martial arts. Off the screen, she was virtually a heroine: at the age of sixteen, she alone successfully fought off a group of gangsters with only a silky belt on the streets of Shanghai. Her early wuxia pictures from 1948-57 were in both Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue, with stories intended to increase cooperation of the Northern Style and Southern Style of martial arts, as seen in The heroine of deadly darts (\u5973\u4fe0\u97ff\u5c3e\u8ffd\u9b42\u93e2) in 1956. These remarkable wuxia films were mostly based on kung fu novels, e.g. Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery Pt 1 & Pt 2 (\u706b\u71d2\u7d05\u84ee\u5bfa) in 1950, The Golden Hairpin Pt 1 & Pt 3 (\u78a7\u8840\u91d1\u91f5) in 1963, Buddha\u2019s Palm (\u5982\u4f86\u795e\u638c), a four-part film, in 1964 and The Burning of Pingyang City (\u706b\u71d2\u5e73\u967d\u57ce) in 1965. Her performances in Cantonese opera were quite different; she brought in a mixture of Peking Opera, in which she performed a lot of footwork, as in Suet Ting Shan and Fan Lai Hua - Meeting on the Weedy River (\u8606\u82b1\u6cb3\u6703\u6bcd) in 1961, Giving birth on the bridge \u2013 the White serpent (\u65b7\u6a4b\u7522\u5b50) in 1962 and How Zhong Wuyan Conquered the West (\u937e\u7121\u8277\u639b\u5e25\u5f81\u897f) in 1962. She also played a male lead as seen in movies Execution of Lui Po at Pak Moon Lau (\u767d\u9580\u6a13\u65ac\u5442\u5e03) in 1961, Two hunters in a pursuit (\u6587\u6b66\u72c0\u5143\u722d\u5f69\u9cf3) in 1962 and The beauties (\u9663\u9663\u7f8e\u4eba\u5a01) in 1964. Apart from action films, she did a few rare contemporary and melodrama films, for example Midsummer night\u2019s romance (\u590f\u591c\u4e4b\u6200) in 1953, Bachelors beware (\u6eab\u67d4\u9109) in 1960 and Two mouthy ladies from the north and south (\u5357\u5317\u9435\u5480\u96de) in 1965. Her golden age of filming was between 1963 and 1966, when she made at least thirty movies in a year. Her surprise roles in The big revenge part 1 and 2 (\u7055\u6c5f\u6cb3\u7554\u8840\u6d77\u4ec7) (1963) and Heaven, Hell and Crystal Palace (\u5929\u5802\u5730\u7344\u6c34\u6676\u5bae) (1965) did not destroy her popularity nor upset her fans; instead they won the hearts of the audience. Her last major movie was filmed in Taiwan (Decree of the fire dragon (\u8840\u706b\u9f8d\u4ee4) in 1968) and she made a guest appearance in Secret agent no.1 (\u795e\u63a2\u4e00\u865f) in 1970. In 2004, Yu was one of the celebrities honoured on the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong. To date, Yu still holds the record among actresses of making more than 170 wuxia movies. ==Personal life== Yu ended her acting career after she married, in 1966, Mak Bing-wing (; 1915\u20131984), a Chinese actor active in Cantonese opera. Mak Bing- wing began his acting career in the 1930s. He left Hong Kong in 1941 for a tour of the United States, returning in 1947 after the Pacific War had ended. While in the United States, Mak appeared in numerous Grandview Film Company productions. Yu So-chow was his second wife. They had three children and later moved to the United States, where she died of pneumonia on 12 May 2017 in San Francisco, California, aged 86. ==Selected filmography== *The revenge of the great swordsman Assassin Zhang Wenxiang (\u5927\u4fe0\u5fa9\u4ec7\u8a18) (1949) *The five heroes'deadly spears (\u4e94\u864e\u65b7\u9b42\u69cd) (1951) *A story of three lovers, pt 1 & 2 (\u557c\u7b11\u59fb\u7de3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1952) *A heroine from Mount Emei(\u5ce8\u5d4b\u5973\u4fe0 ) (1952) *The dragon-phoenix swordsmen(\u9f8d\u9cf3\u96d9\u528d\u4fe0) (1957) *The strange hero conquered the dragon(\u602a\u4fe0\u8d64\u5c60\u9f8d) (1960) *Conqueress(\u7121\u6575\u694a\u5bb6\u5c07) (1961) *The secret book, part one (\u4ed9\u9db4\u795e\u91dd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e09\u96c6) (1961) *The village militia, pt 1 & 2 (\u9b54\u93e1\u795e\u73e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1962) *The blonde hair monster(\u9ec3\u6bdb\u602a\u4eba) (1962) *The birth of the Monkey King(\u99ac\u9a2e\u7cbe\u51fa\u4e16) (1962) *The Road to the west(\u5510\u4e09\u85cf\u53d6\u897f\u7d93) (1962) *Ingentious swords, pt 1 & 2 (\u767d\u9aa8\u9670\u967d\u528d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1962) *Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery pt 1 & 2 (\u706b\u71d2\u7d05\u84ee\u5bfa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1963) *Valiant Pan An (\u6b66\u6f58\u5b89) (1963) *The iron wild goose pt 1 & 2(\u9435\u96c1\u971c\u7fce\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1963) *The tiger in hunting(\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d) (1963) *Pat cham lau lan sai pat wan (\u4e0d\u65ac\u6a13\u862d\u8a93\u4e0d\u9084) (1963) *Spring blossoms(\u82b1\u958b\u5bcc\u8cb4\u9326\u57ce\u6625) (1964) *The Flying Fox(\u842c\u8b8a\u98db\u72d0) (1964) *The invincible kid Fang Shiyu(\u7121\u6575\u795e\u7ae5\u65b9\u4e16\u7389) (1965) *The all-powerful flute pt 1 & 2(\u7c2b\u8072\u9707\u6b66\u6797\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1965) *Hero of midland(\u4e2d\u539f\u5947\u4fe0) (1966) *Fire dragon and the mythical pearl(\u706b\u9f8d\u795e\u73e0) (1966) *Heroic days of the Great Ming Dynasty (\u65b7\u81c2\u795e\u9f8d\u528d) (1966) *The avengers' tale pt 1 & 2 (\u9435\u8840\u6069\u4ec7\u9304\u4e0a\u4e0b\u96c6) (1966) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Iconic Heroines in Cantonese Opera Films *Yu So Chau at Hong Kong Cinemagic * * as Suqiu Yu * as So-Chow Yu Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Hong Kong film actresses Category:Peking opera actresses Category:Singers from Beijing Category:Chinese film actresses Category:Actresses from Beijing Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in California Category:Actresses from San Francisco Category:American people of Northern Han Chinese descent ",
