Baldrich was appointed financial comptroller of Tucum\u00e1n Province by the de facto President, General Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez, in 1943, and in 1944 he was appointed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction by President Farrell, replacing conservative Catholic writer Gustavo Martinez Zuvir\u00eda. His administration continued the nationalist elitist line Mart\u00ednez began, but was more geared to Hispanism and economic nationalism.
