    "text": "The New York State Executive Department is the department of the New York state government that serves as the administrative department of the Governor of New York.Executive Law \u00a7 30. \"There shall continue to be in the state government an executive department. The head of the executive department shall be the governor. The governor may appoint such subordinates and employees as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of his duties as head of the executive department, and may prescribe their duties and fix their compensation within the amounts appropriated therefor.\" This department has no central operating structure; it consists of a number of divisions, offices, boards, commissions, councils, and other independent agencies that provide policy advice and assistance to the governor and conduct activities according to statute or executive order. Its regulations are compiled in title 9 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. ==History== At the time of the New York's 1920s constitutional reforms, the Executive Department\u2014headed by the Governor\u2014housed only a few core functions such as budgeting, procurement, the state police and military and naval affairs. Since that time, numerous agencies have been created within the Executive Department to accommodate governmental functions not anticipated in the 1920s, while conforming with the limits established by the Constitution. These additions include divisions and offices that do not logically fit into the framework of the other departments, such as the Division of Veterans' Affairs (which advises veterans on services, benefits and entitlements, and administers payments of bonuses and annuities to blind veterans) and the Office of General Services (which provides centralized data processing, construction, maintenance and design services as well as printing, transportation and communication systems). ==List of divisions, etc.== Some of the divisions, offices, boards, commissions, councils, and other independent agencies that are part of the New York State Executive Department are the: * New York State PoliceExecutive Law \u00a7 31. \"There shall be in the executive department the following divisions: [...] The division of military and naval affairs.
