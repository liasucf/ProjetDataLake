    "text": "Daniel Joseph Wilson (born 1 January 1960) is a former footballer and manager. He has previously coached Sheffield Wednesday, Bristol City, Milton Keynes Dons, Hartlepool United, Swindon Town, Sheffield United, Barnsley and Chesterfield. ==Playing career== Born in Wigan, Lancashire, Wilson started his career with hometown club Wigan Athletic in the Northern Premier League, scoring once in eight appearances before moving to Bury in the Football League. As a player, he won the Anglo Scottish cup with Chesterfield in 1981, and went on to win the League Cup with both Luton Town in 1988 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1991. His equaliser for Luton against Arsenal with seven minutes remaining in the 1988 final is arguably the most famous match-saving goal in the club's history. He was also a runner-up in both domestic cup finals with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. He also won 24 caps for Northern Ireland, scoring one goal. ==Managerial career== ===Barnsley=== In 1993, Wilson and Viv Anderson joined Barnsley from Sheffield Wednesday on free transfers to become player-assistant manager and manager respectively. 12 months later, after a disappointing season, Wilson was appointed player-manager after Viv Anderson left to become assistant manager to Bryan Robson at Middlesbrough. In 1994\u201395, Barnsley finished sixth in Division One. In an ordinary season this would have meant occupying a playoff place, but due to the Premier League reducing from 22 to 20 clubs, only two teams would be promoted (with fifth placed club occupying the final playoff place) and Barnsley missed out. The following season was a disappointment as the club finished mid-table. In the following season, 1996\u201397, Wilson guided Barnsley to the Premier League as Division One runners-up. It was the first time that Barnsley had won promotion to the top division of English football. Although their stay lasted only a single season before relegation, Wilson's side reached the FA Cup quarter finals knocking out favourites Manchester United in the fifth round. ===Sheffield Wednesday=== In the summer of 1998, Wilson returned to his old club Sheffield Wednesday as manager and was hopeful of revitalising the club's fortunes. They had just finished 16th in the Premier League and five seasons earlier, when Wilson was still on the club's playing staff, they had reached both domestic cup finals and finished seventh in the first ever Premier League. In 1998\u201399, Wilson guided Sheffield Wednesday to a respectable 12th place in the Premier League and had hopes for a top half finish the following season. But he was sacked the following March, having led the club only toward relegation. Four Sheffield based MPs including David Blunkett called for his head in January 2000 (he picked up the Premier League's Manager of the Month award in January 2000) following some poor results like losing 8\u20130 to Newcastle United. Bassetlaw MP Joe Ashton said after his sacking: \"Danny was a lovely fellow, but he couldn't do it (manage Sheffield Wednesday). ===Bristol City=== In June 2000, Wilson was appointed manager of Division Two Bristol City on a four-year contract. He left the club at the end of the 2003\u201304 season after his contract was not renewed, having failed to achieve promotion at the club. ===Milton Keynes Dons=== In December 2004, Wilson took over from Stuart Murdoch as the new manager of the League One side Milton Keynes Dons. In his first season, he managed to save the club from relegation \u2013 they would have gone down had it not been for a 10-point penalty imposed on Wrexham who had gone into receivership. Wilson was unable to save MK Dons from relegation to League Two at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, and he was sacked on 10 May 2006. ===Hartlepool United=== On 13 June 2006, Wilson was appointed manager of Hartlepool United. Wilson took over from Youth Team Coach Paul Stephenson who took temporary charge of the First Team for the late stages of the 2005\u201306 season. Hartlepool United were relegated alongside MK Dons to League Two. In the 2006\u201307 season, he brought Hartlepool to second from top of League 2 and won promotion back to League 1. He left Hartlepool United on 15 December 2008, leaving Chris Turner in temporary charge. === Swindon Town === Appointed manager of Swindon Town on 26 December 2008, Wilson saved the team from relegation that season. Wilson brought in many new signings, including Gordon Greer, Alan O'Brien, Jonathan Douglas, David Lucas and Charlie Austin After getting Swindon into the 10 League 1 Play-off Final, the club lost 0\u20131 against Millwall F.C.. The following 2009\u201310 play-off season saw Wilson and club chairman Andrew Fitton forge many relationships with Premier League and SPL sides, most notably Liverpool, Manchester City and Celtic, who all loaned Wilson players to aid his development of the squad. Wilson released youth team goalkeeper Jamie Stephens to the Liverpool youth academy, who in turn loaned Swindon Stephen Darby, who later scored the winning penalty that put Swindon through to the 2009\u201310 play-off final. Simon Ferry and Paul Caddis were loaned from Celtic, both having since been signed on permanent deals from the club. Wilson loaned Manchester City striker David Ball for the 2010\u201311 season. On 2 March 2011, Wilson resigned his post after a poor run of form that had seen the club slip into the relegation zone. ===Sheffield United=== On 27 May 2011, Wilson was appointed the manager of Sheffield United. The appointment was greeted with some dissatisfaction amongst the fans, as approximately 400 gathered outside Bramall Lane to voice their anger at the appointment, particularly considering his links as a former player and manager of bitter rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Disapproving chants against his appointment could be heard throughout the announcing press conference. Wilson's subsequent statements suggested that he already felt the pressure resultant from having crossed the divide. As part of the restructure of the Blades managerial setup, captain Chris Morgan was promoted to a player-coach position. Morgan had played under Wilson during his earlier years at Barnsley. A couple of weeks later, Wilson appointed former Sheffield United player Frank Barlow as his assistant. Wilson made a positive start at the Blades, winning his first league game in charge with a 2\u20130 victory over Oldham Athletic. This was then followed up by a League Cup victory over Hartlepool United and a 2\u20130 home victory over Brentford in Wilson's first home league game. Wilson was named League One manager of the month for December 2011 after managing the Blades to league victories over Rochdale, Bournemouth, Notts County and Hartlepool United. Despite the Blades scoring 92 league goals and accumulating 90 points (finishing 3rd) in Wilson's first season in charge, the team lost on penalties in the 2011\u201312 League One play-off final against Huddersfield Town. Wilson won the League One manager of the month award for October 2012 after guiding the Blades into the automatic promotion places, including a 19-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, six months later he left Sheffield United on 10 April 2013 following a poor run of form. ===Barnsley=== On 17 December 2013, Wilson was announced as manager of Barnsley for the second time, fifteen years after his previous departure. He took over following the sacking of David Flitcroft with Barnsley at the foot of the Championship table. On 12 February 2015, Wilson was sacked by Barnsley after a poor run of results. ===Chesterfield=== On 24 December 2015 he was named as new manager of Chesterfield, replacing Dean Saunders. His second game in charge saw an impressive 7\u20131 victory against Shrewsbury Town. Wilson secured Chesterfield's League One status with a game to spare, ending the season in 18th place. The following season started brightly under Wilson, with Chesterfield remaining unbeaten in the opening three games of the season, winning two. Wilson was sacked as Chesterfield manager on 8 January 2017, following a 2\u20130 defeat at Bradford City, after a poor run of results. ==Managerial statistics== :As of 7 January 2017 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"5\"|Record |- !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % |- |align=left|Barnsley | |align=left|2 June 1994 |align=left|7 July 1998 ||201||74||55||72|| |- |align=left|Sheffield Wednesday | |align=left|7 July 1998 |align=left|21 March 2000 ||80||23||17||40|| |- |align=left|Bristol City | |align=left|27 June 2000 |align=left|5 June 2004 ||226||107||55||64|| |- |align=left|Milton Keynes Dons | |align=left|7 December 2004 |align=left|21 June 2006 ||82||25||25||32|| |- |align=left|Hartlepool United | |align=left|31 June 2006 |align=left|15 December 2008 ||133||58||29||46|| |- |align=left|Swindon Town | |align=left|26 December 2008 |align=left|2 March 2011 ||121||44||40||37|| |- |align=left|Sheffield United | |align=left|27 May 2011 |align=left|10 April 2013 ||106||55||31||20|| |- |align=left|Barnsley | |align=left|17 December 2013 |align=left|12 February 2015 ||63||19||13||31|| |- |align=left|Chesterfield | |align=left|24 December 2015 |align=left|8 January 2017 ||56||18||10||28|| |- !colspan=4|Total !1,066!!422!!276!!368!! |} ==Honours== ===As a player=== Chesterfield *Anglo-Scottish Cup: 1980\u201381 Luton Town *Football League Cup: 1987\u201388 Sheffield Wednesday *Football League Cup: 1990\u201391 ===As a manager=== Barnsley *Football League First Division runner-up: 1996\u201397 Bristol City *Football League Trophy: 2002\u201303 Hartlepool United *Football League Two runner-up: 2006\u201307 Individual *LMA Manager of the Year: 1996\u201397 *Premier League Manager of the Month: January 2000 *Football League One Manager of the Month: December 2011 ==Personal life== Wilson lives in Chesterfield with his wife Karen.
