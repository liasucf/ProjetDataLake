The church was constructed between 1785 and 1787, with the sacristy added in 1817. The church walls are 21 inches thick, of brick laid in Flemish bond. Atop the roof is a small wooden belfry that in 1933 replaced a larger one in this same location. St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. == First Catholic Parish in English-speaking North America == It is a direct descendant of Maryland's first Roman Catholic Chapel at St. Mary's City, whose communicants formed the first nucleus of American Catholicism. The Parish, then connected to the one in St. Mary's City Maryland also fell under the umbrella of the first establishment of religious freedom in America,Cecilius Calvert, \"Instructions to the Colonists by Lord Baltimore, (1633)\" in Clayton Coleman Hall, ed., Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633-1684 (NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910), 11-23.\"Reconstructing the Brick Chapel of 1667\" Page 1, See section entitled \"The Birthplace of Religious Freedom\" by George Calvert and his sons who established the new colony as a refuge for persecuted Catholics. == Colonial Relics == The church contains artifacts from the original \"The Ark\" and \"The Dove\" sailing ships, which bore the first settlers to the Maryland colony in 1633\u201334. == Stained glass depiction of local Indian chief in battle == The church also has a very old stained glass depiction of the local paramount Indian Chief in battle with rival Indians. That Chief later converted to Christianity and was a member of the parish in the 1640s. == Gallery == Image:St Ignatius Roman Catholic Church Rear Jul 09.JPG|St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church, Rear View, July 2009 Image:St Ignatius Roman Catholic Church Headstone Jul 09.jpg|St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church, Artistic Headstone, July 2009 ==References== ==External links== *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust * *St. Mary's County Historic Preservation Commission: St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church entry *Visit St. Mary's City Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Churches in St. Mary's County, Maryland Category:Roman Catholic churches in Maryland Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1787 Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:1787 establishments in Maryland Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Mary's County, Maryland ",
