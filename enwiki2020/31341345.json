It was built in 1904 in order to keep the ashes of Buddha, given to Japan by the Kingdom of Thailand. \u201d\u899a\u738b\u201d literally means \"Enlightenment King,\" referring to the Buddha, and \u201c\u65e5\u6cf0\u201d means Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand in Japanese. Usually, each temple in Japan belongs to a religious sect. However, Nittai-ji doesn\u2019t belong to any religious sect. Every three years, 19 religious sects take their turn to dispatch a chief priest to Nittai-ji. Usually, the ambassador of the Kingdom of Thailand visits Nittai-ji on his birthday. == History == ===Discovery of the Buddha's relics=== In January 1898, a resident officer from Britain, William Peppe, discovered a pot of soapstone containing human bones when he was excavating a tumulus near the border of Nepal at Piprahwa.Nittai-temple.

Retrieved November 25th, 2015 from http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/thailand/jpth120/knowledge/temple.html Some ancient lettering written on the side of the pot are thought to be dated around the 3rd century B.C. The script reads, \u201cThe pot of the holy remains of Buddha is enshrined with a heart of trust by wife, children, brothers and sisters, together with a Sakya clan in India, Sakya\u201d. This lends support for the historicity of a traditional belief expressed in Buddhist text, which claim that after the Buddha's death, he was cremated and the ashes of his remains were divided into eight portions.Royal Thai Embassy Tokyo.Japan.

Retrieved November 26th 2015 from http://www.thaiembassy.jp/rte1/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=268&Itemid;=242 Some of the portion given to the Sakya clan was kept at Kapilavastu. In the 19th century, many researchers believed the Buddha to be a product of legend. This discovery provided evidence for the Buddha as a historical person. The government of India decided to keep the pot in the Indian Museum in Kolkata and gave the ashes of the Buddha to the royal family of Thailand. King Chulalongkorn kept the ashes in Wat Saket and divided it into several portions as a gift to other Buddhist countries like Ceylon and Burma. When the minister of Japan, Manjiro Inagaki, heard the news, he requested that the king offer a portion of ashes to Japan. The king granted his request and presented a portion of the relics to Japan as a gift from the royal family of Thailand to the Japanese people.Kawaguchi, K.

Mr. Aoki immediately commanded all of the chiefs of Buddhist sects (13 sects and 56 sub sects) to prepare to receive the holy ashes. They held a conference and decided to receive the holy ashes. In June 1900, a mission was organized in order to receive the holy ashes. The mission traveled to Thailand on June 15 of that year and received the holy ashes from King Chulalongkorn at the Royal Palace. They promised King Chulalongkorn to build a new temple not belonging to any Buddhist sect at which to enshrine the holy ashes. King Chulalongkorn also gave a one thousand year old gold-bronze statue of the Buddha, a national treasure in Thailand, to function as the main statue of the Buddha in the new temple. The mission brought the holy ashes back to Japan and the holy ashes were temporarily kept at My\u014dh\u014d-in temple in Kyoto. Representatives from each Buddhist sect in Japan conferred about the new temple that would keep the holy ashes. After many conferences, they decided to build the temple in Nagoya. The Nagoya city government prepared 330,000 square meters of land to build the temple. Finally, in 1904, Nissen-ji (now, Nittai-ji) was built in commemoration of the friendship between Japan and Thailand. == Architecture== ===Stupa=== The Stupa (\u5949\u5b89\u5854 H\u014dan-t\u014d) is an important cultural property designated by Aichi Prefectural Government.

In front of the stupa, there is a round pathway for holding the celebratory annual ritual and circumambulation. The second story contains the Relic Hall (\u820d\u5229\u6bbf Shariden). ===Main Hall=== The main hall (\u672c\u5802 Hond\u014d) is the location of the gold-bronze statue of the Buddha. In front of this hall, there is a signature by the current king of Thailand, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, containing the phrase \u201cSakyamuni Buddha\u201d written in the Thai language.
