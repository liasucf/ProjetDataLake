With specialist expertise as an agricultural school, St Gregory's College provides a co-educational environment for students in the Year K to Year 6 primary school; and a boys-only environment for students in the Year 7 to Year 12 secondary schools. Founded on 3 February 1926 and conducted by the Marist Brothers since 1929, St Gregory's has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 1,100 students, including 180 boarders. The college is located within the Diocese of Wollongong, and is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, the Association of Marist Schools of Australia, and is an associate member of the Independent Schools Association (ISA). ==History== ===Early days=== St Gregory's College commenced operations in 1926. The property on which the college is located was owned by Thomas Donovan. In the early 1920s he contacted the Marist Brothers about starting a school for boys to help them learn the skills to have careers. St Greg's Intermediate class, circa 1932 St Gregory's commenced operations as a boarding school on 3 February 1926 with five Marist Brothers as staff, and two students (The Cuskelly Brothers). By the end of the year the student numbers had risen to ten. In 1929 the estate was handed over to the Marist Brothers by Thomas Donovan. Donovan intended that St Gregory's College should exist for country boys whom he would endow with bursaries. Much of the early infrastructure was also donated by Mr Donovan, for example the Chapel, classrooms and the first dormitory. The foundation Principal in 1926 was Br Felix. However, before the end of the first year he was recalled to his position at St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill. Br Laurentius who was on the staff took over the position. Br Laurentius was only 27 years old but suffered from ill health. Enrolments climbed to around 50 students despite the College not having main electricity or a reliable supply of water. The Great Depression saw enrolments drop to ten students and the college was threatened with closure. Principal Br Laurentius died in 1933 after a long illness. Br Antoninus was appointed the new Principal and led the college during the Depression years. === Recent history === The college has hosted the Marist cricket and basketball Carnival's, Won the Arrive Alive and Nutri-Grain Cup. In 2008 St Gregory's had a mass in celebration of the \"Journey of the World Youth Day Cross and Icon\" just months before World Youth Day in which the college was very involved. In 2018, the College became a K-12 school, with the opening of the Junior School on the College grounds. The Junior and Senior schools are administered separately, under the direction of the Headmaster and the Trustees. The Junior School is co-educational, and the Senior School is a single-sex school for boys only. Girls must seek an alternate secondary school at which to complete their senior education. ===Sexual abuse allegations=== In June, July and August 2014 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began an investigation into the response of Marist Brothers to allegations of child sexual abuse in schools in the ACT, NSW and Queensland. Five former students, one former teacher, a former assistant principal and two former principals, former and current Marist officials and clergy, and one of the clergy at the centre of the allegations gave evidence or made statements before the Royal Commission that the alleged cases of abuse happened during the 1970s, and 1980s at Daramalan College, Canberra, at , Campbelltown and in Far North Queensland.
