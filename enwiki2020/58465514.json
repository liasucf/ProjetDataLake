    "text": "L2 Syntactical Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) developed by Xiaofei Lu at the Pennsylvania State University, is a computational tool which produces syntactic complexity indices of written English language texts. Along with Coh-Metrix, the L2SCA is one of the most extensively used computational tool to compute indices of second language writing development. The L2SCA is also widely utilised in the field of corpus linguistics. The L2SCA is available in a single and a batch mode. The first provides the possibility of analyzing a single written text for 14 syntactic complexity indices. The latter allows the user to analyze 30 written texts simultaneously. ==Usage== ===Second language writing development=== The L2SCA has been used in numerous studies in the field of second language writing development to compute indices of syntactic complexity. ===Corpus linguistics=== The L2SCA has also been used in various studies in the field of corpus linguistics. ==Indices== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- !No. ! !Construct !Index !Abbr.1 |- |1. |rowspan=\"9\" colspan=\"2\"|Syntactic structures |Word count |W |- |2. |Sentence |S |- |3. |Verb phrase |VP |- |4. |Clause |C |- |5. |T-unit |T |- |6. |Dependent clause |DC |- |7. |Complex T-unit |CT |- |8. |Coordinate phrase |CP |- |9. |Complex nominal |CN |- |10. |rowspan=\"14\"|Syntactic complexity indices |rowspan=\"3\"|Length of production units |Mean length of sentence |MLS |- |11. |Mean length of T-unit |MLT |- |12. |Mean length of clause |MLC |- |13. |rowspan=\"3\"|Amounts of coordination |Clause per sentence |C/S |- |14. |Verb phrase per T-unit |V/T |- |15. |Clause per T-unit |C/T |- |16. |rowspan=\"3\"|Amounts of subordination |Dependent clause per clause |DC/C |- |17. |Dependent clause per T-unit |DC/T |- |18. |T-unit per sentence |T/S |- |19. |overall sentence complexity |Complex T-unit ratio |CT/T |- |20. |rowspan=\"4\"|Phrasal sophistication |Coordinate phrase per T-unit |CP/T |- |21. |Coordinate phrase per clause |CP/C |- |22. |Complex nominal per T-unit |CN/T |- |23. |Complex nominal per clause |CN/C |} ;Notes * Note 1: Abbreviation ==See also== *Coh-Metrix == References == == External links == * Category:Computational linguistics Category:Applied linguistics Category:Second language writing ",
