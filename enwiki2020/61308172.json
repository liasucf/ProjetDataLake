She was married to the operetta singer and composer Rudi Gfaller. __FORCETOC__ ==Life and career== Wiet was born in Vienna where her father was a civil servant. She studied at the conservatory there and then trained as a singer in Heidelberg with her aunt, Helene Wiet who had been a prominent opera singer in Prague and Vienna until her retirement from the stage in 1899. She made her debut at the in Heidelberg as Fiametta in Franz von Supp\u00e9's operetta Boccaccio. She was then engaged by the Neuen Operetten-Theater in Leipzig where she sang leading soprano roles in numerous operettas, including the title role in the first Leipzig performance of Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n's Die Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1sf\u00fcrstin. It was in Leipzig that Wiet met her future husband, Rudi Gfaller, at the time a tenor singing with the company and later an operetta composer himself. The couple married in 1912. When Gfaller became the director of Leipzig's in 1926, she moved to that theatre. A critic for Die Weltb\u00fchne noted in 1931 that she could have had international stardom had she not remained \"riveted\" to Leipzig. The Panorama was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, after which the couple retired to their house in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl. She remained active in the musical life of the town until her death in 1971 at the age of 85. Her husband died a year later. They are buried together in the Bad Ischl Cemetery. ==References== ==External links== *The grave of Therese Wiet and Rudi Gfaller in the Bad Ischl Cemetery.
