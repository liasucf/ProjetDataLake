She was assessed at and had triple-expansion engines driving her paddle wheel. The engine was rated at 1.305 nhp and the ship could reach a maximum speed of 20 knots. == Early career == The Koningin Regentes was used as a ferry boat between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom until the outbreak of World War I. She sometimes also carried mail as cargo. == World War I == After World War I began, Koningin Regentes was refitted with special accommodations and a new layer of paint for service as a hospital ship. Her name was therefore also changed to HS Koningin Regentes. The Koningin Regentes now served on a new route between Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Boston, Lincolnshire, England, and operated on this route for nearly the entire war. === Sinking === On 6 June 1918 Koningin Regentes departed Boston bound for Rotterdam. When she was 21 miles east of Leman lightship, she was torpedoed by the Imperial German Navy submarine SM UB-107 and sank shortly afterwards. Seven people lost their lives in the sinking and the survivors were saved soon after. == Wreck == The wreck of Koningin Regentes lies at a depth of and is broken in several pieces. It lies close to an English drilling site, and the sea floor is level with only sand and shells; visibility is also very good. One of the ship\u2032s steam engines lies on top of the ship and her decks have collapsed and are under a lot of sand. ==References== Category:1895 ships Category:Passenger ships of the Netherlands Category:World War I ships of the Netherlands Category:Hospital ships in World War I Category:Paddle steamers Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:Maritime incidents in 1918 Category:World War I shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Ships sunk by German submarines in World War I Category:World War I crimes by Imperial Germany ",
