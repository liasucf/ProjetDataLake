    "text": "The 1917 Denver Pioneers football team represented the University of Denver in the Rocky Mountain Conference (RMC) during the 1917 college football season. In their third season under head coach John Fike, the Pioneers compiled a perfect 9\u20130 record (6\u20130 against RMC opponents), shared the RMC championship with Utah State, and outscored all opponents by a total of 226 to 45. At the end of the season, both Denver and Utah State were undefeated against Rocky Mountain Conference opponents. A game between Denver and Utah State was proposed to determine an undisputed conference champion, but Denver's faculty ruled against the game. Denver officials claimed the title and asserted that the Utah Aggies \"have a right to claim nothing more than a tie for the honors.\"In games against three common conference opponents (Colorado, Wyoming, and Colorado A&M;), Utah State won by a total margin of 120 points; Denver defeated the same three opponents by a total margin of only 31 points. The 1917 team was the only group in the University of Denver's football history to compile a perfect season. ==Schedule== ==References== Denver Category:Denver Pioneers football seasons Category:Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference football champion seasons Category:College football undefeated seasons Denver Pioneers football ",
