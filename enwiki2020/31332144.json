    "text": ", also romanized as gambaru, is a ubiquitous Japanese word which roughly means to slog on tenaciously through tough times.Kristoff, Nicholas. \"Shoichi Yokoi, 82, Is Dead; Japan Soldier Hid 27 Years,\" New York Times (US). September 26, 1997. The word ganbaru is often translated to mean \"doing one\u2019s best\", but in practice, it means doing more than one's best.Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, Sabine. (1998). The word emphasizes \"working with perseverance\"Zeng, Kangmin. (1998). or \"toughing it out\".Kristoff, Nicholas D. \"A Japanese Generation Haunted by Its Past,: New York Times (US). January 22, 1997 Ganbaru means \"to commit oneself fully to a task and to bring that task to an end\".Albach, Horst. (1994). It can be translated to mean persistence, tenacity, doggedness, and hard work. The term has a unique importance in Japanese culture.Allison, Anne. (1994). The New York Times said of Shoichi Yokoi, the Japanese holdout who surrendered in Guam in January 1972, that in Japan \"even those embarrassed by his constant references to the Emperor felt a measure of admiration at his determination and ganbaru spirit\".. After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the slogan \"Gambaro Kobe\" was used to encourage the people of the disaster region as they worked to rebuild their city and their lives.Davies, Roger J. et al. (2001). After the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, gambaru was one of the most commonly heard expressions. \"U.S. donations not rushing to Japan,\" 11Alive News (US). March 17, 2011; excerpt, \"Devin Stewart, a senior director at the Japan Society in New York City, said, \"Suffering and persevering is a type of virtue in Japan ... the ability to persevere and remain calm under difficult situations. Among the most commonly heard expressions there, are gaman, to persevere or tough it out; gambaru, to do your best, to be strong; and shoganai, it cannot be helped, which expresses a sense of fatalism ....\" ==Analysis== Gambaru focuses attention on the importance of finishing a task and never stopping until a goal is achieved. The continuing effort to overcome obstacles (even if not successful) is an important concept in Japan. Unlike the related, but passive gaman, ganbaru is an active process.Haghirian, Parissa. \"Mastering The Basics,\" American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), 15 February 2011; excerpt, \"Where ganbaru is an active process and requires people to do something to achieve their goals, gaman is passive and focuses more on enduring and not complaining.\" Although there are many near synonyms in Japanese, there are few antonyms.Allison, ==See also== * Go Rin No Sho, The Book of 5 Rings * Jiayou, a Chinese term of similar meaning * Paiting, a Korean term of similar meaning * Sisu, a Finnish word denoting tenacity and a broader concept * Stoicism ==Notes== ==References== * Albach, Horst.
