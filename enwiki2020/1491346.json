    "text": "Lalla Fatma N'Soumer (; c.1830 \u2013 c. 1863) was an important figure of the Algerian resistance movement during the first years of the French colonial invasion of Algeria. She was seen as the embodiment of the struggle. Lalla, the female equivalent of the Berber word mass, is an honorific reserved for women of high rank, or who are venerated as saints. From 1854 to July 1857, she assisted in leading a resistance against the French. Once captured by French forces, she was imprisoned until her death six years later. Her disciples would believe that she was gifted powers by God, including the abilities to see the future and cure illness. Her ashes were transferred in 1994 from the cemetery of Sidi Abdellah, 100 meters from the zawiya Boum\u00e2ali in Tourtatine towards the Square of the Martyrs of El Alia Cemetery. == Legacy == Lalla Fadhma's life has been documented in the movie Fadhma N'Soumer, directed by Belkacem Hadjadj and released in 2014. The lead role of Fadhma N'Soumer was played by French actress Laetitia Eido . A few statues of Lalla Fatma are in display in Algeria. A few schools and streets bear her name in Algeria. ==References== * Emile Carrey, R\u00e9cits de Kabylie.
