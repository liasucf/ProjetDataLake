    "text": "Bodrum () is a district and a port city in Mu\u011fla Province, in the southwestern Aegean Region of Turkey. It is located on the southern coast of Bodrum Peninsula, at a point that checks the entry into the Gulf of G\u00f6kova, and is also the center of the eponymous district. The city was called Halicarnassus of Caria in ancient times and was famous for housing the Mausoleum of Mausolus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built by the Knights Hospitaller in the 15th century, Bodrum Castle overlooks the harbour and the marina. The castle includes a museum of underwater archaeology and hosts several cultural festivals throughout the year. The city had a population of 36,317 in 2012. It takes 50 minutes via boat to reach Kos from Bodrum, with services running multiple times a day by at least three operators. == Etymology == In classical antiquity Bodrum was known as Halicarnassus (Ancient Greek: \u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2,\u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, at Perseus project ), a major city in ancient Caria. The suffix -\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (-assos) of Greek \u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is indicative of a substrate toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced or established the place's name. It has been proposed that -\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (-carnassos) part is cognate with Luwian word \"ha+ra/i-na-s\u00e0\", which means fortress.Ilya Yakubovich. \"Phoenician and Luwian in Early Age Cilicia\". Anatolian Studies 65 (2015): 44, doi:10.1017/S0066154615000010 . If so, city's ancient name was probably borrowed from Carian, a Luwic language spoken alongside Greek in Western Anatolia. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with \ud800\udea0\ud800\udea3\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0 \ud800\udeb4\ud800\udea0\ud800\udea5\ud800\udeb5\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0 (alos k\u0302arnos) in inscriptions. The modern name Bodrum derives from the town's medieval name Petronium, which has its roots in the Hospitaller Castle of St. Peter (see history). ==History== Theatre of Halicarnassus in Bodrum, with the Bodrum Castle seen in the background. Halicarnassus ( or Alikarnass\u00f3s; ) was an ancient Greek city at the site of modern Bodrum in Turkey. Halicarnassus was founded by Dorian Greeks, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of Medusa, Athena or Poseidon, or the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were Troezen and Argos. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by Strabo, and were proud of the title of Antheadae. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with Alos\u03b4karnos\u03b4 in inscriptions. At an early period Halicarnassus was a member of the Doric Hexapolis, which included Kos, Cnidus, Lindos, Kameiros and Ialysus; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games, instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century Halicarnassus was under the sway of Artemisia I of Caria (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus ), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the battle of Salamis. Of Pisindalis, her son and successor, little is known; but Lygdamis, the tyrant of Halicarnussus, who next attained power, is notorious for having put to death the poet Panyasis and causing Herodotus, possibly the best known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city (c. 457 BC). At the Suda On Line Project. The city later fell under Persian rule. Under the Persians, it was the capital city of the satrapy of Caria, the region that had since long constituted its hinterland and of which it was the principal port. Its strategic location ensured that the city enjoyed considerable autonomy. Archaeological evidence from the period such as the recently discovered Salmakis (Kaplankalesi) Inscription, now in Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, attest to the particular pride its inhabitants had developed. Alexander the Great laid siege to the city after his arrival in Carian lands and, together with his ally, the queen Ada of Caria, captured it after fighting in 334 BCE. ===Mausolus=== Mausolus ruled Caria from here, nominally on behalf of the Persians and independently in practical terms, for much of his reign from 377 to 353 BC. When he died in 353 BC, Artemisia II of Caria, who was both his sister and his widow, employed the ancient Greek architects Satyros and Pythis, and the four sculptors Bryaxis, Scopas, Leochares and Timotheus to build a monument, as well as a tomb, for him. The word \"mausoleum\" derives from the structure of this tomb. It was a temple-like structure decorated with reliefs and statuary on a massive base. Today only the foundations and a few pieces of sculpture remain. ===Petronium=== left Crusader Knights arrived in 1402 and used the remains of the Mausoleum as a quarry to build the still impressively standing Bodrum Castle (Castle of Saint Peter), which is a well-preserved example of the late Crusader architecture in the east Mediterranean. The Knights Hospitaller (Knights of St. John) were given permission to build it by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed I, after Tamerlane had destroyed their previous fortress located in \u0130zmir's inner bay. The castle and its town became known as Petronium, whence the modern name Bodrum derives. In 1522, Suleiman the Magnificent conquered the base of the Crusader knights on the island of Rhodes, who then relocated first briefly to Sicily and later permanently to Malta, leaving the Castle of Saint Peter and Bodrum to the Ottoman Empire. ===20th century=== Bodrum was a quiet town of fishermen and sponge divers until the mid-20th century; although, as Mansur points out, the presence of a large community of bilingual Cretan Turks, coupled with the conditions of free trade and access with the islands of the Southern Dodecanese until 1935, made it less provincial. The fact that traditional agriculture was not a very rewarding activity in the rather dry peninsula also prevented the formation of a class of large landowners. Bodrum has no notable history of political or religious extremism either. A first nucleus of intellectuals started to form after the 1950s around the writer Cevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131, who had first come here in exile two decades before and was charmed by the town to the point of adopting the pen name Halikarnas Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131s\u0131 ('The Fisherman of Halicarnassus').Bodream, Jean- Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2010, pp.62-66 ==Geography== ===Climate=== Bodrum has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Winter average is around and in the summer , with very sunny spells. Summers are hot and mostly sunny and winters are mild and humid. == Main sights == The Castle of St. Peter was built by the Knights Hospitaller. The Castle of St. Peter, also known as Bodrum Castle, is one of the major attractions on the peninsula. The castle was built by the Knights Hospitaller during 15th century and the walls of fortification contains some pieces of the Mausoleum ruins, as it was used as a source for construction materials. The Castle of Bodrum retains its original design and character of Knights' period and reflects Gothic architecture. It also contains the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, a museum opened by Turkish Government in 1962 for the underwater discoveries of ancient shipwrecks in the Aegean Sea. In 2016 the castle was inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey. The castle is currently under renovation since 2017 and only some parts of it is accessible for touristic purposes. Built in 4th century BC, ruins of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is also one of the main sights in Bodrum. It was a tomb designed by the Greek architects and built for Mausolus, a satrap in the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was once considered as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but by the 12th century CE had mostly been destroyed. Today ruins of the tomb attracts both domestic and international tourists. It is planned to turn the ruins into an open-air museum in future years. Apart from Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, there are also other museums that are located on the peninsula. Zeki M\u00fcren Art Museum is a museum dedicated to Turkish classical musician Zeki M\u00fcren. After his death, the house in which the artist lived in Bodrum for the last years of his life was transformed into Zeki M\u00fcren Art Museum by the order of the Ministry of Culture and was opened to the public on 8 June 2000. Bodrum Maritime Museum is another museum of Bodrum that targets to conduct activities regarding classification, exhibition, restoration, conservation, storage and safekeeping of the historical documents, works and objects important for the maritime history of the city. Bodrum City Museum is a minor museum in city center that presents the general history of Bodrum peninsula.

Even though naked sponge diving's past can be traced back at least three thousand years in the Aegean region, modern sponge diving started to be prevalent in Bodrum after the Koan and Cretan immigrants settled in the city in the early 20s, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. During its golden age between 1945 and 1965, there were close to 150 boats engaged in sponge diving activities in Bodrum. However, due to the sponge diseases, artificial sponge production and ban on sponge diving eventually ended this lucrative industry in Bodrum.left Over the years, tourism became one of the major activities and main income source of local communities in Bodrum.Bodrum The abundance of visitors has also enlivened Bodrum's retail and service industry.
