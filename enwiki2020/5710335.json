    "text": "Bust in Alba Iulia. Ioan (or Ion) Fluera\u0219 (or Fluiera\u0219) (November 2, 1882 - June 7, 1953) was a Romanian social democratic politician and a victim of the communist regime. ==Biography== ===Early activities=== Born in Cherelu\u0219 (Ker\u00fcl\u0151s), Arad County, in the Cri\u0219ana region,Constantiniu; Roz he trained as a wheelwright and settled in Arad, where he became active in socialist circles. In 1901, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, and began contributing to its press in Hungary; with Iosif Jumanca and Tiron Albani, he led the Party's ethnic Romanian wing.110 ani de social-democra\u021bie, p.3, 15 The latter eventually reformed itself as the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. At the time, Fluera\u0219 unsuccessfully ran in elections for the Hungarian diet.Roz Between 1906 and 1914, he was editor-in-chief of Adev\u0103rul (the party newspaper), until it was closed down by Hungarian authorities. Living in Budapest, Fluera\u0219 was conscripted after the outbreak of World War I, and worked for the Austro-Hungarian Air Service in a factory on Csepel Island. ===Transylvanian politics=== In the summer of 1918, he and Jumanca became involved in reestablishing Adev\u0103rul, which, inspired by the Fourteen Points, became connected with the fight for emancipation of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat, and their eventual union with Romania. Before the Aster Revolution, Fluera\u0219 and Jumanca were charged with contacting the Romanian National Party, negotiations which led, in early October, to the creation of Consiliul Na\u021bional Rom\u00e2n Central (CNRC, the Central Romanian National Council).Constantiniu The CNRC was instrumental in convoking the Alba Iulia Assembly of December 1, 1918, one which declared Transylvania's secession from the Hungarian Republic, and its will to join with Romania; Fluera\u0219 was the Assembly's vice president, and subsequently served as Chief of Department of Social Security and Hygiene in the Directory Council (the de facto government of the region, led by Iuliu Maniu).110 ani de social- democra\u021bie, p.16; Br\u0103tescu; Constantiniu; Roz Among the other Social Democrats in the Council were Jumanca, Albani, and Enea Grapini. On the very day of the Alba Iulia Assembly, he was elected general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat. Later in the same month, after a strike was worker's rally broken up in Bucharest and the newly created Socialist Party of Romania (PS) repressed, Fluera\u0219 and Jumanca, urged by Constantin Titel Petrescu, met with King Ferdinand I and Premier Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu, persuading them to grant concessions to the labor movement.Br\u0103tescu In 1920, he was one of Romania's envoys to the Paris Peace Conference. ===Interwar Romania=== In late 1918, the Transylvanian and Banat socialists agreed to join the PS as a distinct section. In late 1919, Fluera\u0219, Jumanca, and Ilie Moscovici carried unsuccessful negotiations for a merger between Alexandru Averescu's People's League and the Socialist groups; talks were mediated by Constantin Argetoianu.Argetoianu Alongside Gheorghe Cristescu, Alexandru Dobrogeanu- Gherea and others, Fluera\u0219 was a delegate to the Second Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, where the matter of the PSR's joining of the international body and its support of Bolshevik lines were debated. The Transylvanian delegates and, as a former member of the Directory Council, Fluera\u0219 first and foremost, were the target of Nikolai Bukharin and Christian Rakovsky's attacks, given that they supported a Greater Romania in front of Bolshevik principles; upon their return, Fluera\u0219, Gheorghe Popovici, and others were expelled from the PS (despite Cristescu's reserves) -- the remaining group reformed itself as the Romanian Communist Party (PCR).110 ani de social-democra\u021bie, p.17; Constantiniu; Denize; Frunz\u0103, p.22-23, 269-270; Roz; Tism\u0103neanu, p.45-46 After the reestablishment of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSD) as a socialist group opposed to the PCR, Fluera\u0219 served several terms as a party representative to the Chamber of Deputies of Romania. He settled in Bucharest in 1922, and worked for the Labor Ministry. With Moscovici, \u0218erban Voinea, and Iacob Pistiner, Fluera\u0219 represented the PSD to the 1924 Congress of the Labor and Socialist International in Marseille.110 ani de social-democra\u021bie, p.19 When the authoritarian regime of King Carol II was imposed in 1938, he supported the change and remained active in the guilds established by the new corporatist structure of the National Renaissance Front (as a member of the Upper Economic Council and the Senate).110 ani de social- democra\u021bie, p.23, 24; Constantiniu; Tism\u0103neanu, p.60 A potential target of Iron Guard reprisals during the National Legionary State, Fluera\u0219 survived the Legionnaires' Rebellion, and, upon the Guard's defeat, sent a congratulatory telegram to Conduc\u0103tor Ion Antonescu.Scurtu, p.11 He retreated from public life for the rest of World War II. ===After World War II=== In early 1945, after the royal coup that toppled Ion Antonescu's pro-Nazi regime and placed Romania in the Allies camp, Fluera\u0219 and George Grigorovici founded the Socialist Democratic Party, which claimed legitimacy inside the socialist camp and denounced collaboration with the Communists.110 ani de social-democra\u021bie, p.24 It was dissolved in September 1946. Fluera\u0219 remained opposed to the main Social Democratic Party (PSD), and accused the growing Soviet influence which had found its advocates inside the latter political group (the wing led by Lothar R\u0103d\u0103ceanu and \u0218tefan Voitec). He also allegedly refused office in the Communist-backed Petru Groza government, and rallied with Constantin Titel Petrescu's Independent Social Democrats, which had split with the PSD over the issue of running common lists with the communists. He was arrested in late 1948, presented as a dissident PSD member,Frunz\u0103, p.229, 283 tried for \"having collaborated with a fascist regime\", and held in various prisons inside the country, where he was routinely tortured, being ultimately murdered by two fellow inmates, Constantin Juberian and \u0218tefan Rek in Gherla prison (according to one testimony, he was beaten to death with sandbags).Traiul \u0219i sf\u00e2r\u0219itul...
