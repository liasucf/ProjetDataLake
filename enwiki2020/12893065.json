A crew must detonate nuclear fusion weapons underground and push the crust back into its proper position. Meanwhile, on the surface, there is a debate as to whether to inform the public about the impending crisis. ==Cast== == See also == * * == References == == External links == * * * Category:Syfy original films Category:Canadian disaster films Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films Category:2000s disaster films Category:2005 science fiction films Category:Canadian science fiction films Category:Canadian films Category:CineTel Films films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian television films ",
