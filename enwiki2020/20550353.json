    "text": "Jill-Lyn Euto (March 20, 1982 - January 28, 2001) was an eighteen-year-old American youth from Syracuse, New York who was found murdered on January 28, 2001. Her mother found her stabbed to death in her apartment. Her murder remains unsolved. ==Biography== Euto was studying to be a paramedic while working at clothing store Aeropostale in Shopping Town Mall. ==Murder== Euto had previously made plans to watch the Super Bowl with her mother and sister on January 28, 2001. When Euto did not show up, her mother, Joanne Browning, called her phone and received no answer. On January 29, Joanne called Euto's work and was told that she had not shown up for a scheduled shift. With her fear for her daughter heightened, Joanne went to Euto's sixth-floor apartment at 600 James Street in Syracuse, New York. Joanne found Euto's body and informed the police. Investigators have stated that the murder occurred between noon and 3 pm on January 28. No locks were broken and no money was taken. Based on eyewitness reports, whoever killed her did not come into the building with her. The murder weapon was one of Euto's own kitchen knives. ==Investigation and aftermath== To date, police have not publicly identified any suspects. Following the murder, Joanne Browning appeared on national television on shows such as The Sally Jessy Raphael Show, The Montel Williams Show, and the case has been profiled on America's Most Wanted.\"Jill-Lyn Euto: Six Years After\", by Molly English-Bowers,Syracuse New Times, January 24, 2007. Retrieved March 5, 2010. In 2006, Joanne Browning filed a lawsuit against the property owner of the apartment. The complaint alleged that the property owners failed to \"take minimal precautions to protect decedent from foreseeable harm from the criminal conduct of a third party.\" The case was dismissed due to lack of proof of negligence on behalf of the property owner. An annual candlelight vigil for Jill took place from 2001 to 2007 to remember Jill and raise awareness. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders ==References== ==External links== *justice4jill-lyn Website *Syracuse Police Cold Case Site Category:2001 deaths Category:2001 in New York (state) Category:2001 murders in the United States Category:American murder victims Category:Deaths by stabbing in New York (state) Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Female murder victims Category:January 2001 events in the United States Category:People murdered in New York (state) Category:Unsolved murders in the United States ",
