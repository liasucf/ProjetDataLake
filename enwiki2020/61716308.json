    "text": "Kristin K. Baldwin is an American scientist and Professor at the Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University. Her research focuses on using reprogrammed and induced pluripotent stem cells to model and study the epigenetic changes of the genome and the brain. == Early life and education == Baldwin completed a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Zoology with honors at Duke University, Durham, NC. She completed her PhD in Immunology at Stanford University, CA in 1998. == Career and research == Baldwin was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in the laboratory of Mark M. Davis. From 1998 to 2005 she was an associate research scientist / postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY. in the laboratory of Richard Axel. Since 2016, she has been an assistant professor, associate professor and full professor at Scripps Research. Baldwin is currently a Professor at the Department of Neuroscience and Investigator, Dorris Neuroscience Center at Scripps Research and an adjunct professor at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Department of Neuroscience. She is a member of Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine. Baldwin research uses direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons or reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to neurons, and studies their gene expression to define neuronal subtypes in normal development and different diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia or addiction. Recently, her group also identified and characterized antibody libraries for de-differentiating cells. == Awards and honors == *NIH Director's Pioneer Award (2016) *Kavli Fellow and Session Chair, Kavli Frontiers of Science Symposium (2012) * Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation Faculty Scholar (2011) *California institute of regenerative medicine (CIRM) New Faculty Awardee (2008) * Pew Scholar in the Biological Sciences (2007) * Whitehall Grant Award (2007) == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American scientists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:American women neuroscientists Category:Duke University Trinity College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Scripps Research faculty ",
