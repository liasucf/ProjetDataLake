    "text": "right Araka-Kalai is a role-playing game supplement for H\u00e2rnMaster published by Columbia Games in 1987. ==Publication history== Araka-Kalai was the first supplement created for H\u00e2rnMaster, written by Edwin King and Dave Kowan, with art by Eric Hotz. It was published in 1987 by Columbia Games as a 44-page book, with two center-bound cardstock character sheets. ==Contents== Araka- Kalai is a campaign setting focussed on a colossal noxious sinkhole called the Pit of Araka-Kalai and the uncharted caverns beneath it that contain monsters, shrines and cults. The Pit itself is filled with a strange organic sludge as well as the ruined temple of the god Ilvir. The supplement includes seven mini-scenarios set in the area, although several of the scenarios are only undetailed sketches. Reviewer Ken Rolston noted that \"The adventures themselves are really little more than scenario outlines, though one or two provide enough detail to qualify as complete adventures.\" ==Reception== In the October 1989 edition of Dragon, Ken Rolston was impressed with the production values and writing, noting that \"The graphics are excellent, with color maps, abundant diagrams of locations and buildings, and appropriate, expressive illustrations of scenes, characters, and creatures. The style of presentation is clear and detailed, and is dry with an occasional droll impulse. It is well organized for reading and reference. And the campaign materials \u2014 well, they\u2019re voluminous, historically and socially plausible, and full of dramatic fantasy adventure and thematic hooks.\" Given the originality of the setting versus the paucity of detail in the adventure scenarios, Rolston thought that it was \"more distinguished as a campaign setting than an adventure supplement\". Nevertheless he gave it a thumbs up, saying, \"This is a strongly recommended adventure setting.\" ==References== Category:Fantasy role-playing game supplements Category:H\u00e2rn supplements ",
