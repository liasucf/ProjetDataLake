It has believed to have gotten the name Amitabh Bachchan Falls from the Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, who is very tall. It is one of the tallest waterfall shown to tourists by local tour operators and cab-drivers- cum-guides. Like most other waterfalls in Sikkim there is much confusion with pictures shown by a random Google search. ==External links== *https://www.flickr.com/photos/d-40/5452492981/in/set-72157625947337063 ==References== Category:North Sikkim district Category:Waterfalls of Sikkim Category:Tourist attractions in Sikkim Category:Amitabh Bachchan ",
