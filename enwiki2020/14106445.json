    "text": "Coupe de Ville is a 1990 American comedy-drama film directed by Joe Roth. It stars Daniel Stern, Arye Gross, and Patrick Dempsey as three very different brothers asked by their father to drive a 1954 Cadillac Series 62 convertible from Detroit to Miami. ==Plot== Meet the Libner brothers: Marvin (Daniel Stern), the oldest, is a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Buddy (Arye Gross), the middle child, is a timid dreamer. Bobby (Patrick Dempsey), the youngest, is a handsome rebel in reform school. As kids, they fought a lot and as adults, they barely speak to each other. In the summer of 1963, their tough and eccentric father, Fred (Alan Arkin), gives them a task: to bring a 1954 Cadillac, bought for their mother, Betty (Rita Taggart), from Detroit to Miami. As the trip goes on, the three brothers fight and begin to reconnect with each other while trying to keep the Caddy in mint condition. ==Cast== * Patrick Dempsey as Robert \"Bobby\" Libner * Arye Gross as Buddy Libner * Daniel Stern as Marvin Libner * Alan Arkin as Fred \"Pop\" Libner * Rita Taggart as Betty Libner * Annabeth Gish as Tammy * Joseph Bologna as Uncle Phil Libner * James Gammon as Dr. Sturgeon, the Cadillac Surgeon * Ray Lykins as Rick * Chris Lombardi as Raymond * Josh Segal as Billy Sturgeon == Production == Despite of the film's title, the Cadillac in the movie is not a Coupe De Ville.
