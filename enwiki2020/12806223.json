    "text": "A cruise ship poolside theater is a giant LED display screen, ranging from around 250 to 350 square feet (33 m2). It is complemented with a large, 50,000-80,000 watt sound system. The theater is usually placed facing the main swimming pool of a cruise ship. The theater can be used to display news, sporting events, poolside activities, concerts, and movies. The poolside theater was introduced in 2004 on the Caribbean Princess, and was built with or installed on other ships in Princess Cruises's fleet. Princess named their poolside theaters as \"Movies Under The Stars\", but the theater is used all day. For the outdoor nighttime movies (weather permitting), cushions and blankets are placed over the deck chairs, and popcorn is provided. The \"Movies Under The Stars\" name also refers to the service via cable television in the staterooms at night.http://www.princess.com/news/article.jsp?newsArticleId=na804&submit;=pk In 2005 Carnival Cruise Lines launched their first ship with a poolside theater, the Carnival Liberty. Carnival named their poolside theaters as \"Carnival's Seaside Theater\". Since the launch of the Carnival Liberty, every new cruise ship built by Carnival has had the \"Carnival Seaside Theater\" added.http://www.carnival.com/CMS/Articles/seasidetheatre_expansion.aspx In 2005 and in 2006, Disney Cruise Lines has installed its own poolside theater on its two older ships refurbishments. Costa Cruises also has introduced poolside theaters on its Concordia-class fleet. Royal Caribbean International debuted outdoor movie screens as part of the \"Aquatheater\" on the Oasis class, and has since been added poolside screens to most of their fleet as part of the \"Royal Advantage\" revitalization program. == Images == Image:MoviesOutdoor.jpg|The poolside theater on the Caribbean Princess Image:CarnivalLibertyPoolside.jpg|The poolside theater on the Carnival Liberty Image:Carnival Victory Seaside Theater.jpg|The poolside theater on the Carnival Victory == Cruise ships that have a poolside theater == === AIDA Cruises === *AIDAluna *AIDAblu *AIDAsol *AIDAmar *AIDAstella ===Carnival Cruise Lines=== *Carnival Freedom *Carnival Liberty *Carnival Splendor *Carnival Valor *Carnival Victory *Carnival Magic *Carnival Dream *Carnival Triumph *Carnival Sunshine *Carnival Conquest *Carnival Glory *Carnival Breeze *Carnival Pride *Carnival Vista ===Costa Cruises=== *Costa Diadema *Costa Favolosa *Costa Fascinosa *Costa Luminosa *Costa Pacifica *Costa Serena ===Disney Cruise Line=== *Disney Dream *Disney Fantasy *Disney Magic *Disney Wonder ===Dream Cruises=== *Genting Dream ===MSC Cruises=== *MSC Fantasia *MSC Musica *MSC Orchestra *MSC Poesia ===Norwegian Cruise Line=== *Norwegian Epic *Norwegian Escape === P&O; Cruises === *Azura ====P&O; Cruises Australia==== *Pacific Jewel *Pacific Pearl ===Princess Cruise Lines=== *Caribbean Princess *Coral Princess *Crown Princess *Dawn Princess *Diamond Princess *Emerald Princess *Golden Princess *Grand Princess *'''' *Ruby Princess *Royal Princess *Sapphire Princess *Sea Princess *Star Princess *Sun Princess ===Royal Caribbean International=== * Vision Class ** ** ** ** ** ** * Voyager Class ** ** ** ** ** * Radiance Class ** ** ** * Freedom Class ** ** ** * Oasis Class ** ** * Quantum Class ** ** ** (Under Construction) == References == Category:Cinemas and movie theaters ",
