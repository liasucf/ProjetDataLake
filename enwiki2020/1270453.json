The range's foothills stretch into Cabarrus, Anson,Union,and Richmond counties and terminate in the hills of Person County. The Uwharries were once a coastal mountain range; isostasy has slowly raised the eastern seabed until today they lie in the Piedmont of North Carolina over 150 miles from the coast. Formed approximately 500 million years ago by accretion along the Gondwanan tectonic plate, they are thought to have once peaked at some 20,000 feet,uwharries.com before eroding to a maximum of just over 1,100 ft. The range's high point is High Rock Mountain (1,188 feet/362 meters as measured by the NC Geodetic Survey), in southwestern Davidson County. The Uwharries lie within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. They give their name to the Uwharrie National Forest. Once entirely cleared for timber and farmland, the mountains were designated a U.S. National Forest in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. The woodlands have since returned, providing a haven for a diversity of wildlife, recreational facilities, and numerous Native American archeological sites. In 1799, the discovery of gold at the nearby Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County led to America's first gold rush. The North Carolina Zoo, America's first state- supported zoo, is located in the Uwharries region. The Caraway Mountains, a segment of the Uwharries, are located in western Randolph County, west of Asheboro. ==Protected areas== * Birkhead Mountains Wilderness * Morrow Mountain State Park * Uwharrie National Forest ==References== ==External links== * Uwharrie Forest page at UNC Asheville * Category:Mountain ranges of North Carolina Category:Landforms of Randolph County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Montgomery County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Stanly County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Davidson County, North Carolina ",
