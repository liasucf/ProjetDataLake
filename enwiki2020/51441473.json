Neuamt was a bailiwick (Obervogtei) of the Z\u00fcrichgau, a subject territory of Z\u00fcrich within the Old Swiss Confederacy, from 1442 to 1798. The bailiwick was detached from the County of Kyburg as the latter was given to emperor Frederick III to ensure his support in the Old Z\u00fcrich War. The territories of Kyburg left of the Glatt river were retained by Z\u00fcrich, and were not re-attached to Kyburg when the county was re-purchased from the Habsburg ten years later. The bailiwick was administered by two reeves (Oberv\u00f6gte) residing in Z\u00fcrich. The former bailiwick now forms part of the Z\u00fcrcher Unterland within the canton of Z\u00fcrich, forming a strip of land west of the Glatt river with a width between tree and ten kilometres, including territory now in the municipalities of: Weiach, Stadel, Neerach, Hochfelden, H\u00f6ri, Niederglatt, Niederhasli, Regensdorf (Adlikon). Enneth\u00f6ri was a settlement east of the Glatt, attached to the Neuamt in 1667/89. == References == * Sammlung Schweizerischer Rechtsquellen, I.
