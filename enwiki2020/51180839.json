In response to the perceived threat, Japanese residents were forced into internment camps. It was only in April 1949 that the all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians. The memorial's light was eventually re-lit on August 2, 1985. In remembrance of those who fought for freedom & democracy in WWI and those who volunteered and died in WWII, even while their families (some of whom were themselves veterans of WWI) were interned in concentration camps.
