    "text": "Super black is a surface treatment developed at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the United Kingdom. It absorbs approximately 99.6% of visible light at normal incidence, while conventional black paint absorbs about 97.5%. At other angles of incidence, super black is even more effective: at an angle of 45\u00b0, it absorbs 99.9% of light. ==Technology== The technology to create super black involves chemically etching a nickel\u2013phosphorus alloy. Applications of super black are in specialist optical instruments for reducing unwanted reflections. The disadvantage of this material is its low optical thickness, as it is a surface treatment. As a result, infrared light of a wavelength longer than a few micrometers penetrates through the dark layer and has much higher reflectivity. The reported spectral dependence increases from about 1% at 3 \u00b5m to 50% at 20 \u00b5m. In 2009, a competitor to the super black material, Vantablack, was developed based on carbon nanotubes. It has a relatively flat reflectance in a wide spectral range. In 2011, NASA and the US Army began funding research in the use of nanotube-based super black coatings in sensitive optics.Nanostructured Super-Black Optical Materials 10/23/2013 Nanotube-based superblack arrays and coatings have recently become commercially available. ==See also== * Emissivity * Black hole * Black body ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:Materials science Category:Optics Category:Shades of black ",
