Majestic first appeared in the Register of Shipping (RS) in 1805 with Coults, master, Chapman, owner, and trade Government service.RS (1805), Seq.\u211629. On 6 January 1800 Lloyd's List reported that the transport Majestic had burnt to her waterline at Barbados. Majestic was lying in Carlisle Bay off Barbados on 20 October 1808 when she caught fire. The cause was believed to have been a candle put on a cask of rum that then ignited fumes. There were some 170 officers and men of the York Rangers on board, all of whom were saved, though they lost their arms and equipment. Boats towed Majestic out of the bay where she was allowed to drift to leeward. Three of her crew died in the fire. The Register of Shipping for 1810 showed Majestic with Harland, master, Chapman & Co., owners, and trade Government service. It carried the annotation \"BURNT\".RS (1810), Seq.\u211635. ==Citations== ==References== * * Category:1804 ships Category:Ships built in Whitby Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Maritime incidents in 1808 Category:Ship fires Category:Shipwrecks in the Caribbean Sea ",
