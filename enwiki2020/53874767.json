In science he is best known as historian of philosophy and author of a monumental work on 16th century Spanish thinkers, though he contributed also to history, theory of law and theology. In politics he is recognized chiefly as a Traditionalist theorist of state, apart from his rather modest militancy within Integrism and Carlism. Throughout all his life he was also active in various lay Catholic organizations. ==Family and youth== Rosequilloin Wikimedia Commons misspelled as \"Riosequillo\" entry gate The Solana family was first recorded in the 13th century as related to Lia\u00f1o, a village currently situated on the outskirts of Santander;Aurelio Gonz\u00e1lez de Riancho Colongues, Marcial Solana y Gonzalez-Camino, [in:] LXXV Aniversario del Centro de Estudios Monta\u00f1eses.

In unclear circumstances in late August 1936 he crossed the French frontierhis biographer claims that Solana left Spain \"rapidamente\" via the Navarrese Dancharinea on August 31, 1936, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 58. It is neither clear when and how Solana found himself in Navarre nor why he crossed to France, as Navarre was from the onset firmly controlled by the Nationalists but soon returned and spent 1937 in Valle de Baztan, following the Nationalist seizure of Cantabria returning to his Rosequillo estate.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, pp. 30-31 He is not listed as active member of the Carlist executive,the work discussing in detail Carlist debates prior and after the Unification Decree does not mention Solana a single time, see Juan Carlos Pe\u00f1as Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s, El Carlismo, la Rep\u00fablica y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937).

It also marked the climax of his engagement: in the 1950s Solana abandoned militancy and focused on scientific and Catholic duties.Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 366 ==Philosopher== Juan Viv\u00e8s, Flanders Solana dedicated most of his scholarly attention to philosophyBueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 89 and though he fathered other attempts mostly in theology, he excelled as historian.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 21 The question underlying most of his efforts is about existence of filosof\u00eda espa\u00f1ola, a category bearing features specific to the Spanish realm. His answer was to the affirmative. It was founded on assertion that a specifically Spanish philosophical approach was formulated in the 16th century, deemed Siglo de Oro,Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 24 and owing its constituting features to Juan Luis Vives, Francisco de Vitoria, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, Domingo de Soto and Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 116-117 It comprised a multitude of trends, yet its backbone was the late scholastic schoolSolana started to demonstrate penchant for the Spanish scholastics already when writing his PhD dissertation, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 48 spanned between vivismo and suarismo;Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 20 it gave rise to a number of currents which were to power the Spanish philosophy later on,\"fueron los espa\u0144oles quienes elevaron la filosof\u00eda escol\u00e1stica a la perfecci\u00f3n que alcanz\u00f3 en el siglo XVI.

On the opposite end were the Liberal thinkers, even the iconic ones, and his references to Unamuno or Ortega y Gasset are extremely rare;though by the end of his life Solana ordered a book of Ortega, apparently intrigued by his popularity abroad similarly he displayed scarce interest in foreign philosophers. Francisco Suarez Solana fathered some 60 works related to philosophy and theology;Gonz\u00e1lez de Riancho Colongues 2009, pp. 163-4 most are minor pieces.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 345-363 His opus magnum, not only in philosophy, is La Historia de la Filosof\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola. \u00c9poca del Renacimiento, a massive 3-volume work written in 1928-1933 and published in 1941;the first volume was 699 pages, the second one 604 pages and the third one 636 pages. The opus followed a homogenous pattern, discussing individual philosophers one by one; a biography was followed by discussion of works written, summary of thought and evaluation against the background of Spanish philosophy a stepping stone towards it was an earlier 1927 study.Los grandes escol\u00e1sticos espa\u0144oles de los siglos XVI y XVII: sus doctrinas filos\u00f3ficas y su significaci\u00f3n en la Historia de la Filosof\u00eda A much smaller work dubbed synthesis of his thought was Fueron los espa\u00f1oles quienes elevaron la filosof\u00eda Escol\u00e1stica a la perfecci\u00f3n (1955).full title Fueron los espa\u0144oles quienes elevaron la filosof\u00eda Escol\u00e1stica a la perfecci\u00f3n que alcanz\u00f3 en el siglo XVI Another huge work is a massive treaty on juridical systems according to the Thomist epistemology (1925).Exposici\u00f3n y cr\u00edtica de los modernos sistemas jur\u00eddicos a la luz de la teor\u00eda tomista del conocimiento.

The first one is \"monarqu\u00eda hereditaria\". The second one is \"monarqu\u00eda templada\", i.e. royal powers moderated by collegial bodies representing the society.according to Solana the representation enjoyed by society in the Cortes \"no son el resultado de la divisi\u00f3n social, subordinada, jerarquizada o estratificada como la concibe el marxismo o la econom\u00eda pol\u00edtica\", but the result of traditional bodies and establishments, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 369 The third one is \"descentralizaci\u00f3n y autarqu\u00eda\",contemporary scholars maintain that when writing about autarchy Solana meant self-government, Jacek Bartyzel, Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji, Radzymin 2015, ; p. 113. He also used the term \"organismo prot\u00e1rquico\", see his El tradicionalismo, p. 557 i.e. far-reaching self-governmenta contemporary scholars claims that Solana preferred to speak bout autarqu\u00eda rathen than about autonomy as the latter was getting increasingly associated with peripheral nationalisms. For Solana, a region was a nation in statu nascendi which stopped developing, \"naciones incipientes\", \"g\u00e9rmenes de naciones que no llegaron a serlo\", Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 367 of \"intra-sovereign entities\",literally \"personas infrasoberanas\", Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 298, Bartyzel 2015, p. 113 communities organized on geographical,the geographic ones are best embodied in \"sistema foral\" as outlined in manifestos of Carlist royals, like Carlos VII issuing his Carta Manifiesto of 1869 professional, functional or any other basis.see Marcial Solana, \u00bfQu\u00e9 es el tradicionalismo pol\u00edtico espa\u0144ol?, [in:] Tradici\u00f3n 1933, pp. 281-283 Solana's own contribution is described as picking Traditionalist doctrine up where de Mella left off and developing it to confront totalitarian theories emerging in the 1920s and 1930s.Bartyzel 2015, p. 113 Solana's thought contained a strong anti-tyrannical thread, embodied already in the concept of a moderated monarchy; he also largely ignored his rival to the title of key party pundit, V\u00edctor Pradera, whose thought endorsed dictatorial solutions.Pradera was assassinated by the Republican militia and in the Nationalist zone he was treated as a martyr. Despite this, in Solana\u2019s key political treaty, El Tradicionalismo pol\u00edtico espa\u0144ol, written in 1937-1939, Pradera merited only \"decena de citas\"; in the same work V\u00e1zqued de Mella was mentioned 68 times, Gil Robles 46 times, Ram\u00f3n Nocedal 34 times, Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo 25 times and Antonio Aparisi 23 times, referred after Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 370. During his lifetime Pradera seemed mutually critical of Solana, referring to him as \"distingyished caveman\" (\"caracterizado cavern\u00edcola\") and noting that \"not all of us have to live in a sty\" (\"no todos debemos vivir en las cochiqueras\"), Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 22 During the Republic Solana produced a treaty on the right to resist and to overthrow a despotic regime.La resistencia a la tiran\u00eda, seg\u00fan los tratadistas del siglo de oro espa\u0144ola, printed in 4 parts in Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola of August and September 1934 However, an entirely new element introduced to Traditionalism was spelling out its incompatibility with totalitarian concepts. He went to great lengths denouncing Soviet, Fascist and Nazi regimes,\"pone especial inter\u00e9s en deslindar el corpus te\u00f3rico del carlismo de los movimientos totalitarios tan de moda en el 'bando nacional'. Y para ello se detiene en estudiar algunas de las obras te\u00f3ricas m\u00e1s importantes como La doctrina del fascismo, de Benito Mussolini (1935), el Mein Kampf de Adolf H\u00edtler, el Gran informe sobre del fascismo (1929) y varios discursos pronunciados por el Duce\", Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 257 claiming that the tyranny and deification of state which they introduce, combined with excessive nationalism, render them \"irreconcilable Traditionalist enemies\".Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 257, Bartyzel 2015, p. 232 Manuscript of his key theoretical work, completed in 1938, in its epilogue contained a veiled warning to Franco; it noted that Traditionalists would never support a regime based on foreign ideas,Solana pledged Traditionalist to support to any government, \"mon\u00e1rquico o no, con la condici\u00f3n de que practique las ideas tradicionalistas espa\u00f1olas\", but warned also that \"al que no las practique no le seguiremos jam\u00e1s y por los t\u00e9rminos legales le combatiremos siempre, sea quien fuere, ll\u00e1mese como se llame\", El tradicionalismo referred after Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 370 lamented \"espantosa guerra civil que desangra a la Patria\" and feared \"que tanta sangre y tantas ru\u00ednas y tantas desgracias\" might turn useless.\"que tanta sangre y tantas ruinas y tantas desgracias no sean in\u00fatiles\", El tradicionalismo referred after Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 370 Juan Vazquez de Mella Like some Traditionalists, Solana welcomed democracy though he understood it simply as a principle of representation.Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, pp. 369-370 Other a bit unorthodox piece of his concepts were references to \"derechos del hombre\",Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 369 praise of religious and educational liberties (though \"rectamente entendida\" and \"para f\u00ednes l\u00edcitos\"),Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 370. His biographer claims that though Solana advocated moral unity between state and church, he claimed that both should be separate and divided in therms of administration and economy; he reportedly opposed state subsidies to the Church, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 14. This claim seems incompatible with Solana\u2019s 1916 amendments to the state budget, referred in El Siglo Futuro 07.12.16, available here notes that a human was the end and not the meansBueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 15 and that \"sociedad es para el hombre y no al rev\u00e9s\".El tradicionalismo p. 250, referred after Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 15 Some of his writings contain highly exalted passages on exceptional role of the Spaniards, comments resemblant of typical nationalist discourse and quite atypical for Traditionalism.Solana 1934, pp. 71-73 Finally, as member of the movement which prided itself on belligerent past Solana was unusually bold in condemnation of \"espirit\u00fa de violencia\"; though he applied it mostly to foreign ideas,Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 257, Bartyzel 2015, p. 232 he was also careful to note that notorious \"Traditionalist intransigency\" had its limits.namely the rules of Lord and the good of Spain, Solana 1934, p. 69 Last but not least, he considered himself a Traditionalist rather than a Carlist.for Solana Carlism was more about a doctrine than about a dynasty, Pedro S\u00e1inz Rodr\u00edguez, Testimonio y recuerdos, Barcelona 1978, p. 295, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 16 As political theorist Solana was not a prolific writer. His legacy consists of one major work, El Tradicionalismo pol\u00edtico espa\u00f1ol y la ciencia hispana, written in 1937-1938 and published in 1951;Marcial Solana, El Tradicionalismo pol\u00edtico espa\u0144ol y la ciencia hispana, Madrid 1951, 682 pages it contains his vision of Traditionalist regime discussed against the Spanish theoretical background. The next to be listed is a mid-size treaty La resistencia a la tiran\u00eda (1933),the scholars discussed in the article are mostly Alonso de Castro, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, Juan de Mariana and Juan M\u00e1rquez followed by some 10 smallEl regionalismo (1918), La espa\u0144olizaci\u00f3n de Espa\u0144a por la Tradici\u00f3n (1932), Do\u0144a Cirila Gonz\u00e1lez-Camino, tradicionalista ejemplar (1933), Tradicionalismo igual Navarrismo (1934) and very small pieces.El liberalismo, he ah\u00ed el enemigo (1933), Qu\u00e9 es el tradicionalismo pol\u00edtico espa\u0144ol?

(1934), all 2-3 page notes Out of these one should single out unpublished letters to Alfonso Carlos, in fact legal treaties on Carlist succession rules.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 300-304 ==Other writings and activities== Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo Solana published some 40 works on history, mostly minor press articles he contributed from the 1910sBueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 24 to the 1950s. None of them is of general importance; his historiographic works which stand out are two mid-size biographical studiesDon Francisco Xavier de Villanueva y Sota. Comisario Ordenador de Marina (1931) and Notas sobre la vida militar de Don Pedro Solana y Collado Coronel de Infanter\u00eda (1945) and two heraldic dissertations,El escudo de la ciudad de Santander (1922), La Her\u00e1ldica en el Real Valle de Villaescusa.

In the 1920s he entered Sociedad Men\u00e9ndez PelayoBueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 24 and started contributing to its Bolet\u00edn, in 1940 becoming member of Junta Directiva.Solana greatly appreciated his entry into the Junta, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 60, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 32 In 1934 he co-founded Centro de Estudios Monta\u00f1es, nominated member of the board and jefe of secci\u00f3n de biograf\u00eda; in 1939 he grew to vice-president and in 1940 to president.Solana resigned in 1944 and remained a member of the executive, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 58 Since the 1930s he took part in works of Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para el Progreso de las Ciencias.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 32 In 1940 Solana entered Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 60 In 1945 he was invited to join Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Pol\u00edticas as acad\u00e9mico correspondiente, admitted in 1951 upon his address Fueron los espa\u00f1oles quienes elevaron la Filosof\u00eda escol\u00e1stica a la perfecci\u00f3n.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 61-2 In 1951 he was nominated Cronista del Real Valle de Villaescusa.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 63 In the 1950s he became a member of numerous provincial Santander bodies: Patronato de las Cuevas Prehist\u00f3ricas,La Vanguardia 21.08.55, available here provincial Consejo de Cultura,Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 35 Universidad de Verano and Colegio C\u00e1ntabro.Gonz\u00e1lez de Riancho Colongues 2009, p. 162 Though not particularly active beyond his native Cantabria, at times Solana was recorded as delivering lectures \u2013 usually related to 16th-century Spanish philosophy \u2013 to scholarly and semi-scholarly audiences elsewhere.for Granada see La Prensa 24.04.44, available here, for Barcelona see Spain 1948, available here Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica logotype An entirely different thread is incessant Solana's activity in religious organizations. Already during his academic years he was engaged in Apostolado de la Oraci\u00f3n, Congregaci\u00f3n de la Inmaculada y San Luis Gonzaga, Academia de Literatura Pr\u00e1ctica de San Luis Gonzaga and Congregaci\u00f3n Universal de la Casa Santa de Loreto.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 45-6 In the 1920s he entered the Malta Order,Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 25 contributed to various religious assemblies,Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 56 excelled in ACNDPBueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 50 and Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica;ABC 17.11.29, available here in the 1930s he was considered prospective member of Academia Pont\u00edfica de Ciencias.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 56-7 In the 1940s he limited himself to co-operation with the local Santander hierarchy, e.g. entering Comisi\u00f3n Ejecutiva for various reconstruction works;Bueis G\u00fcemes 2014, p. 33 in the 1950s he acted as attorney for some real estates, held by the Santander diocese.Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 62 Last but not least, he contributed financially to renovating local temples.e.g. in 1951 contributing to renovation of Santuario de Socabarga ==Reception and legacy== RACMYP site Some Solana's works were rewarded in the mid-1920s;Relaciones entre el Derecho y la Moral seg\u00fan la doctrina de Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino was rewarded at juegos florales of 1925, Exposici\u00f3n y cr\u00edtica de los modernos sistemas jur\u00eddicos a la luz de la teor\u00eda tomista del conocimiento won the prize of University of Salamanca in 1925, papal nuncio rewarded Solana for his writings on Aquinas, also in 1925, see El Adelanto 25.03.25, available here his first major honor was the 1927 Premio de Torre\u00e1naz, awarded by RACMYP.for Los grandes escol\u00e1sticos, ABC 29.10.27, available here Historia de la Filosof\u00eda was commenced as a response to grand competition to complete history of Spanish philosophy, launched by Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para el Progreso de las Ciencias; the work was submitted in 1933 and declared victorious in April 1936,Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 23 earning Premio Echegaray.Gonz\u00e1lez de Riancho Colongues 2009, p. 163 In the scholarly realm the reception was overwhelmingly positive, though with many reservations.Romero Raizabal noted that the work \"no merece la importancia que le est\u00e1n dando. Tiene defectos tan notorios que hasta yo mismo los conozco\". Ram\u00f3n Ce\u0144al Lorente wrote \"en tono muy cr\u00edtico\" and fumed about poor introduction. Padre Cris\u00f3gono claimed too much attention was dedicated to biography sections and too much focus was on mystic, logic and cosmovision. Domingos Maur\u00edcio Gomes Dos Santos complained about Portuguese authors being underrepresented. Padre Goenaga complained about arbitrary choice of philosophers and too little synthesis, marginalised by descriptive accounts. Guillermo Fraile considered the periodisation debatable. Detailed discussion in Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, pp. 22-32. Solana\u2019s cousin Zamanillo laughed that no-one would ever bother to read \"esto\"; when asked how the jury would make their mind, Zamanillo suggested they would consider weight in kilograms, and hence Solana stood a high chance of winning, Bueis G\u00fcemes 2015, p. 22 Solana's position was already established; formal confirmation came with the 1945 invitation to RACMYP. Starting the 1950s Solana's work on Renaissance Spanish philosophy became a must-have reference of any work dealing with history of Spanish philosophyAdolfo Mu\u0144oz Alonso, Las ideas filos\u00f3ficas en Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo, Madrid 1956, p. 16, Joaqu\u00edn de Encinas, La tradici\u00f3n espa\u0144ola y la revoluci\u00f3n, Madrid, 1958, p. 209 and some works covering Siglo de Oro seem based exclusively on Solana's study, though not all credited him.the work of Frederick Copleston in its section relared to Siglo de Oro resembles Solana\u2019s work in terms of selection of authors, contents and discussion, but contains no reference (except bibliographical address at the end), Frederick Copleston, Historia de la Filosof\u00eda, Barcelona 1975, According to some, no better work has been written until today.\"this is probably the most thorough history of Spanish philosophy of the Golden Age, but its direct summary format detracts somewhat from its usefulness\", Henry W.

The work was released commercially in two versons; a scaled down one was Antonio de los Bueis G\u00fcemes, Marcial Solana. Estudio cr\u00edtico, Madrid 2014 (no ISBN), and a full-blown one Antonio de los Bueis G\u00fcemes, Marcial Solana. Una vida en la tradici\u00f3n, Santander 2015, The work provides an all-round discussion of Solana, yet it clearly focuses on his work as historian of philosophy. Solana's theory of state went into almost total oblivion;Solana is not mentioned in a recent encyclopedical entry on Spanish Traditionalism, see Pedro Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Cuevas, Tradicionalismo, [in:] Javier Fern\u00e1ndez Sebasti\u00e1n (ed.), Diccionario pol\u00edtico y social del siglo XX espa\u00f1ol, Madrid 2008, , pp. 1163-1173 even within the Traditionalist and Carlist realm it is entirely overshadowed by later works of El\u00edas de Tejada and Gambra.a very recent monograph on Spanish Traditionalism mentions Solana 3 times. In comparison, V\u00e1zquez de Mella is noted 57 times, Gambra 77 times and El\u00edas de Tejada 113 times, see Bartyzel 2015. Among numerous Tradiitonalist websites, usually ignoring Solana, the exception is Hispanismo service, available here Founders of the Left-wing Partido Carlista dismissed it as \"escrito con una mentalidad reaccionaria\".Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 412, Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos.

It was published in 4 parts: 1) Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola 01.08.33, pp. 352-371, available here; 2) Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola 16.08.33, pp. 442-461, available here; 3) Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola 01.09.33, pp. 580-590, available here; 4) Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola 16.09.33, pp. 1-8, available here. Solana briefly discusses Plato and Aristotle (353-355) before moving to Aquinas. He first listed 3 reasons for complacency (p. 358) before moving to the issue of resistance; Solana claims also that according to Aquinas, also the secular power was to be obeyed if ruling to the benefit of order and justice (p. 361). According to Solana, Aquinas recommended passive resistance over an active one, namely to \"evitar los males que acarrea el levantamiento contra el tirano\" (p. 363). In Solana\u2019s reading of Aquinas, if no mode of resistance (including the active one) was feasible, people should limit themselves to trust in God (p. 363). Most of the essay is dedicated to Spanish thinkers one by one (I: 364-371, II: 441-461, III:580-583), followed by their synthesis (III:583-590, IV:1-4). In the very final section Solana tackles the question whether the doctrine of siglo de oro theorists was applicable to tyranny as understood in the 1930s (IV:4-8). The answers was to the affirmative, conditional and with preference to passive resistance (p. 7) discussing views of the Siglo de Oro theorists on tyrannical rule.at times also other Solana works are interpreted as instigation to rebellion against the Republic, e.g one scholar claims that in Solana\u2019s 1934 address Tradicionalismo igual Navarrismo \"la sublevaci\u00f3n fue interpretada como una afirmaci\u00f3n de la navarridad\", Floren Aoiz, El jarr\u00f3n roto: la transici\u00f3n en Navarra: una cuesti\u00f3n de Estado, Tafalla 2005, , p. 171 Referred to by both English and Spanish scholars as \"lay theologian/te\u00f3logo seglar\",Pedro Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Cuevas, Las tradiciones ideologicas de la extrema derecha espa\u00f1ola, [in:] Hispania LXI/1 (2001), p. 132, Pedro Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Cuevas, Historia de las derechas espa\u00f1olas: de la Ilustraci\u00f3n a nuestros d\u00edas, Madrid 2000, , p. 332. The English-language verson can be found in numerous works, see e.g. Martin Blinkhorn, Spain in conflict 1931-1939: democracy and its enemies, London 1986, , p. 161.

In fact, out of 56 pages of Solana\u2019s work only 8 were dedicated to Aquinas. Solana did not advance own claims as to what was right but styled his work as referring thought of earlier philosophers. Finally, Solana noted that according to the authors referred, a regime must share a number of features before resistance to its rule would be justified and \"produced theological justifications for the violent overthrow of the Republic\", \"argued that violence against the Republic was justified\",Preston 2012, available online here instigated anti-Semitism by disseminating the idea \"that there was a Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik plot\u201d and \"the political left had thus to be annihilated at all cost\".Nil Santianez, Topographies of Fascism: Habitus, Space, and Writing in Twentieth-century Spain, Toronto 2013, , p 135. In fact, the article contained not a single reference to Jews, Masons or Bolsheviks. Neither did the text mention destruction, annihilation or extermination of the enemy. Then, instead of referring to \"at all cost\" opposition, it listed a number of conditions that must be met before resistance to a tyrant is offered, and clearly expressed preference for passive over active resistance The article provided rationale for counting Solana among architects of \"the Spanish Holocaust\" and \"theorists of extermination\".Preston 2012 Rosequillo estate today In his last will Solana marked funds and a large Villaescusa plotslightly excededing 4 ha, Bolet\u00edn Oficial de la Provincia de Santander 15.10.76, available here for Fundaci\u00f3n Marcial Solana, entrusted with setting up a college in La Concha.
