Located south of Mecca, the clan is a branch of Zahran tribe, among its leaders Tufayl ibn Amr, one of Muhammad's companions. There are Islamic prophecies with regards to 'End-Times' that have quoted the tribe; like the following by Abu Hurairah: > Abu Hurairah said, I heard the Prophet say, The Hour will not come until the > buttocks of the women of Daws move (quiver) whist going around Dhu > l-Khalasah. Dhu l-Khalasah was an idol worshiped by the tribe of Daws during > the Jahiliyyah.
