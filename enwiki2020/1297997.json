Its northern and western peripheries are primarily agricultural. ==History== Kleinburg was founded in 1848 by John Nicholas Kline (1825\u20131854), a German-Canadian settler. A direct German translation of Kleinburg is \"small castle\". Residents argue that the community of Kleinburg could be named after its founder or after its landscape (though the latter would necessitate the spelling \"Kleinberg\", \"Small Mountain\" in English). In its early days, Kleinburg was dependent on its many flour and wheat mills, located off the Humber River. Kleinburg has historically been a small, quiet town, but now attracts many affluent visitors and residents. Housing developments began in the 1950s in the west and continued in the 1970s southeast of Kleinburg. Other developments occurred in 1993 in the south, 1998 in the northeast, and the 2000s to the north. During its major expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s, many new large homes were built. ==Main Street== The historic commercial district of Kleinburg along Islington Avenue has many heritage buildings, as well as modern developments with mixed residential and commercial uses. Main street has local shops, restaurants, and national chains including Subway, Starbucks, and Royal Bank. Its oldest extant building, built in 1867, is home of The Doctor's House restaurant. Local attractions include McMichael Art Gallery, Kortright Centre, Humber River Trails, Bindertwine Park, Pierre Berton Heritage Centre, and Copper Creek Golf Course. ==Politics== Kleinburg is not an incorporated entity; it has no political jurisdiction and no geopolitically-defined boundaries.
