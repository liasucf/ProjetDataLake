    "text": "Toa Baja () is a city and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the northern coast, north of Toa Alta and Bayam\u00f3n; east of Dorado; and west of Cata\u00f1o. Toa Baja is spread over five barrios, including Toa Baja barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Toa Baja is considered to be a part of the Metropolitan Area. It shares its metropolitan area status with San Juan, Bayam\u00f3n, Guaynabo, Cata\u00f1o, Carolina and Trujillo Alto. Toa Baja is located fifteen minutes by car from San Juan and one hour from Ponce. ==History== The region of what is now Toa Baja belonged to the Ta\u00edno region of Toa and Bayam\u00f3n, which was located on the north coast of Puerto Rico. The regions were led by cacique Aramana and Majagua respectively. During the Spanish colonization, a farm was settled in the region around 1511 where Spanish settlers tried to learn from the Ta\u00ednos how to grow fruits and vegetables. Some of the families that settled in the region were the Marrero, Salgado, and Mart\u00ednez, which came from the Canary Islands. In 1745, the town was officially organized, with the parish being built in 1749. It was dedicated to Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception). It is said that in 1776 there were six cattle ranches and 12 sugar cane estates in the region. However, rises in the flow of nearby rivers were problematic for the population. Because of this, in 1841 a group of residents requested the settlement to be transferred to what is now Dorado. The town of Dorado was officially founded the next year. In 1902, after the U.S. invasion, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved the consolidation of several municipalities, which resulted in the annexation of Toa Baja to the city of Bayam\u00f3n. However, in 1905 the law was annulled, and Toa Baja regained its status as an independent town. In 2010, Toa Baja was among the top ten municipalities in Puerto Rico, in terms of population, with 89,609. ===Hurricane Maria=== The Plata River rose more than 11 feet on September 20, 2017 with (Hurricane Maria) causing major flooding to areas along the river. Radar installation at Punta Salinas in Toa Baja The four radar systems used by the Federal Aviation Administration in Puerto Rico were broken and took almost two weeks to restore. One of the radar systems is located at Punta Salinas in Toa Baja. ===Flood control project=== In mid 2018, the United States Army Corps of Engineers announced it would be undertaking a major flood control project of a river that often causes flooding in Toa Baja, R\u00edo de la Plata. ==Geography== Toa Baja is located in the Northern Coastal Plains of the island, in the karst zone. It has an area of 24.0 miles2 (62.4 km2). The terrain consists mostly of alluvial deposits and clay-like surface as a result of the surrounding waters. The elevations range from 200 to 490 feet (60 to 150 meters) above sea level, with most of its highest parts located in the south. The rest of the area is mostly plain. The northern part of Toa Baja is characterized for its mangroves and marshes, while the southern part is classified as typical karst area. Updated flood zone maps (as of 2019) show that Toa Baja is extremely vulnerable to flooding, along with Humacao, Rinc\u00f3n, Barceloneta, and Corozal. For its many rivers, almost the entire municipality of Toa Baja is in the flood zone area. Homes in Toa Baja have historically been built a few feet above ground level to account for flooding. After Hurricane Maria, architects from the University of Puerto Rico and Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico provided residents of Toa Baja with ideas on how to mitigate flooding. ===Water features=== There are three main rivers in Toa Baja: R\u00edo de la Plata, R\u00edo Cocal, and R\u00edo Hondo. La Plata is the longest river on the island and crosses Toa Baja in the east. Cocal is the natural boundary between Toa Baja and Dorado. Boca Vieja Bay () is a bay located in Toa Baja. ===Barrios=== Subdivisions of Toa Baja. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Toa Baja is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . # Candelaria # Media Luna # Palo Seco # Sabana Seca # Toa Baja barrio-pueblo ===Sectors=== Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci\u00f3n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. ===Special Communities=== Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods are in Toa Baja: Sector Villa Hostos (Campanillas), San Jos\u00e9, Sector El 26, Toa Ville, Villa Albizu in Candelaria, Villa Calma, Villa del Sol, Villa Esperanza, Villa Marisol, and Villa Quintero. In 2009, an order was given by Governor Luis G. Fortu\u00f1o to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a \"Special Community\", which consisted of homes built illegally on flood-prone, state land. The Federal Emergency Management Agency bought these homes from the Puerto Rican government in order to keep the land from being used further. In January 2010, the Puerto Rican government began demolishing some of the homes. The village had a large population of Dominicans, including illegal aliens. In 2013, the mayor and the community continued to argue about how to construct in Villas del Sol. By 2016, six years after the community had been promised, by the government of Toa Baja, that it would receive permits for the building of critical infrastructure, it had not. Some families had dispersed, others had constructed humble homes on land obtained from a private donor. ==Demographics== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=3|Race (self-defined) Toa Baja, Puerto Rico \u2013 2010 Census |----- !
