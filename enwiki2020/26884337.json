    "text": "The TCF/LEF family is a group of transcription factors which bind to DNA through a SOX-like high mobility group domain. They are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where they recruit the coactivator beta-catenin to enhancer elements of genes they target. They can also recruit members of the Groucho family of corepressors. ==Human members== *TCF7 (TCF-1) *TCF7L1 (TCF-3) *TCF7L2 (TCF-4) *LEF1 ==References== * NCBI CDD: cd01388 (SOX-TCF_HMG-box); human proteins Category:Developmental genes and proteins Category:Transcription factors ",
