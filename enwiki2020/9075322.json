On January 23, 2007 The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80 percent initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20 percent to be acquired over time. In 2006 Korkunov had $100 million in sales worldwide, produced 25,000 metric tons of chocolate, and exported 5% of that from Russia. In December 2012 A. Korkunov opened a chocolate boutique in Moscow selling 15 types of hot chocolate and freshly made products from the production facility in Odintsovo. Possible future plans include more boutiques throughout Russia if the logistic problems can be solved. ==See also== * Food industry of Russia ==External links== *Official website *Wrigley's press release == References== Category:Russian chocolate companies Category:Companies based in Moscow Category:Food and drink companies established in 1999 Category:Russian brands Category:2007 mergers and acquisitions Category:1999 establishments in Russia ",
