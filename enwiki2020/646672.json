    "text": "Wanaka (), once called Pembroke, is a popular ski and summer resort town in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. At the southern end of Lake W\u0101naka, it is at the start of the Clutha River and is the gateway to Mount Aspiring National Park. Wanaka is primarily a resort town with both summer and winter seasons. Its economy is based on the many outdoor opportunities this offers. Historically, M\u0101ori visited the Wanaka area to hunt and fish in summer, or on their way to seek pounamu (greenstone) on the West Coast. Ng\u0101i Tahu abandoned their seasonal camps after a raid by a North Island war party in 1836. The current town was founded during the gold rush of the 19th century. Along with the rest of the Queenstown-Lakes District, Wanaka is growing rapidly, with the population increasing by 50% between 2005 and 2015. ==History== Wanaka was visited annually by Ng\u0101i Tahu who sought greenstone in the mountains above the Haast River and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending the Clutha River / Mata-Au in reed boats called m\u014dkihi. Ng\u0101i Tahu use of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In 1836, the Ng\u0101ti Tama chief Te Puoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass: they fell on the Ng\u0101i Tahu encampment between Lake W\u0101naka and Lake H\u0101wea, capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children. Some of the Ng\u0101i Tahu fled down the Waitaki river to the coast; Te Puoho took his captives over the Crown Range to Lake Wakatipu and thence to Southland where he was killed and his war party destroyed by the southern Ng\u0101i Tahu leader Tuhawaiki. The first European to visit the area was Nathaniel Chalmers, who was guided inland by Chiefs Reko and Kaikoura in 1853. Reko and Kaikoura showed Chalmers the rock bridge \"Whatatorere\" at Roaring Meg, which was the only place that the Kawarau River could be jumped over, and returned him down the Clutha in a m\u014dkihi reed boat. European settlement began in the Upper Clutha River Valley in the 1850s, with the establishment of sheep stations by runholders. The first station was at Albert Town, the only place where settlers could ford the Clutha River. The present site of Wanaka was first surveyed in 1863. Settlement increased in Pembroke during the 1870s because of timber milling in the Matukituki Valley that used Lake W\u0101naka for transport. Tourism began in 1867 when Theodore Russell opened the first hotel, and with the world's first sheepdog trials. The town of Pembroke was renamed Wanaka in 1940. Wanaka proved a very popular tourist destination because of its borderline continental climate and easy access to snow and water. ==Geography== Wanaka cafe strip on a quiet clear spring dayThe town of Wanaka is situated at the southern end of Lake W\u0101naka, surrounded by mountains. To the southwest is the Crown Range and town of Queenstown (); to the north the Haast Pass cuts through the Southern Alps near Makarora. To the northeast are the towns of Omarama and Twizel. Very close to Lake W\u0101naka is Lake H\u0101wea, in a parallel glacial valley, which has a recently developed settlement of about 1,500 people. To the south of the town lies more of the Southern Alps. The Glendhu Bay motorpark is close to the town, leading into the Matukituki River valley which gives access to the Mount Aspiring National Park. The centre of the town lies on flat land beside Roy's Bay. Parts of the town have expanded into the hills surrounding the centre and around Roy's Bay in both directions. The lakeside area of the town is prone to occasional flooding in spring, when heavy rain and snowmelt can cause the lake to rise quickly, as in November 1999. ===Climate=== Despite New Zealand's mostly oceanic climate, Wanaka is one of the few areas in the country to enjoy a semi-continental climate, with four distinct seasons.

That Wanaka Tree close to winter ===Winter=== Tramping to the summit of Treble ConeWanaka has the broadest range of snow activity choices of any town in NZ. These include Treble Cone, Cardrona Alpine Resort and Snow Farm, some of New Zealand's premier commercial ski fields. Wanaka is the main accommodation provider for these resorts and so is very busy in high season (July\u2013September). Winter in Wanaka is also the home to a variety of winter sporting events including everything from the annual free Winter Games to The Merino Muster. Treble Cone has good lift-accessed terrain and for this reason has become popular amongst visitors, 'ConeHeads'. It also catches some of the better snow in the area, with its location and orientation getting more snow from NW storms. Cardrona is more attractive to families and beginners, though an attempt has been made at the park riding population in competition with SnowPark. Snowpark is a dedicated 100% artificial terrain park for advanced riders. Snow Farm is New Zealand's only commercial cross-country ski field. Cardrona also hosts one of the few Olympic sized halfpipes in the world and has been used for practice for Olympic competition. ==Government== Nationally, Wanaka is part of the Waitaki electorate, represented by the New Zealand National Party's Jacqui Dean since 2005.

During the early 20th century an unsuccessful proposal was made for the Otago Central Railway, then terminated at Cromwell, to be extended to Wanaka and onward to Lake H\u0101wea.Over the Garden Wall : The Story of the Otago Central Railway, James Albert Dangerfield, George West Emerson; New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (Otago Branch), 1967 The main reason for NZR's reluctance was having to cross the Clutha River twice. A more direct route to H\u0101wea was planned but dropped due to cost. ==References== ==External links== * *Wanaka promotions site *Warbirds over Wanaka website Category:Queenstown-Lakes District Category:Populated places in Otago Category:Climbing areas of New Zealand ",
