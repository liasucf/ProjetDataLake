    "text": "The Purduettes are the primary all-female choral ensemble of Purdue University. Formed in 1942, the group typically consists of 50-60 undergraduate collegiate women, and performs a variety of jazz, gospel, and swing songs. Similar to the all-male Purdue Varsity Glee Club, the Purduettes are housed within Purdue Musical Organizations, wear matching attire, employ student leadership, and feature smaller groups of members known as Specialites that perform during shows. The group is a featured ensemble annually in the Purdue Christmas Show, and in 2017 the Purduettes celebrated their 75th anniversary. Roughly every 4\u20135 years the Purduettes tour internationally, most recently to Costa Rica in 2015, and were planned to travel to Italy in spring 2020. == Current Roster (2020-2021) == * First Sopranos ** Madi Delay ** Alyssa Easton ** Caitlyn Freville** ** Hannah Friddle ** Ashley Fritz ** Hanna Golichowski ** Brittany Gonzalez-Pelayo ** Brein Gross* ** Grace Kindig ** Allie Roberts ** Andrea Romero ** Nisha Sen-Gupta ** Serena Viau* ** Elizabeth Waterman * Second Sopranos ** Geraldine Berkemeier ** Allie Dinkens ** Elishayva Humphrey ** Cara Janis ** Bella Matthews ** Lauren Pengiel* ** Hadleigh Pierce ** Caroline Roth ** Rachel Smith ** Caroline Svendsen ** Sydney Thoma ** Lilly VanFossen * First Altos ** Kyley Carmany* ** Caitlyn Cass ** Katie Chandler ** Emily Collins** ** Allison Deckard ** Sara Hobart ** Kylie Koutsouros ** Jessica Miller ** Egypt Owens ** Morgan Pierce ** Hope Schimmelpfennig ** Maddie Shafer* ** Victoria Vitatoe * Second Altos ** Jennifer Ascher* ** Rachel Cooper ** Cecilia Daily ** Fiona Gannon ** Madison Sailer ** Eleanor Hamilton* ** Jordyn Hanni* ** Amanda Kirchner ** Meredith LaPlante ** Addison Schreiber ** Clarissa Vasquez ** Hannah Wachnicki *Indicates student leadership == Current Specialty Groups (2020-2021) == *Purduette Trio **Serena Viau **Katie Chandler **Jessica Miller *The Remedy **Caitlyn Freville **Hadleigh Pierce **Morgan Pierce **Eleanor Hamilton *Lonely Hearts **Sydney Thoma **Ashley Fritz **Bella Matthews **Maddie Shafer **Fiona Gannon **Addison Schreiber == References == Category:American choirs Category:Purdue University ",
