He left to join ASI Data Science (now Faculty), a company founded by his brother Marc Warner in 2014, where he is now a commercial principal. Warner was a key figure in the computer modelling used by Vote Leave's successful 2016 referendum campaign. He was brought in by Dominic Cummings to run the Conservative Party's private computer model for the 2019 general election, which predicted that the Conservative Party would win 364 seats (they won 365).
