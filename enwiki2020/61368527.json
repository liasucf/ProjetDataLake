Lead vocalist Nick 13 said the album had a more stripped and guitar-driven production than the band's previous releases. They also say they used vintage equipment in the recording to get a retro 1950s sound. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Greg Calbi \u2013 mastering * Keith Cooper \u2013 backing vocals * Djordje Stijepovic \u2013 standup bass * Mike Fasano \u2013 drums * Linas Garsys \u2013 artwork * Ben Grey \u2013 backing vocals * Ted Hutt \u2013 acoustic guitar, mixing, producer, shaker, tambourine * Sergie Loobkoff \u2013 artwork * Ryan Mall \u2013 engineer * Don Nemarnik \u2013 technician * Nick 13 \u2013 composer, guitar, vocals * Skinhead Rob \u2013 backing vocals * Jason Stockwell \u2013 technician * Dave Whiston \u2013 guitar technician ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ Chart performance of Retrofuture ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Tiger Army albums Category:Rise Records albums ",
