    "text": "Hotel del Luna () is a 2019 South Korean television series, starring Lee Ji- eun and Yeo Jin-goo as the owner and manager, respectively, of the eponymous hotel that caters only to ghosts. Produced by GT:st, written by the Hong sisters and directed by Oh Choong-hwan, it aired on tvN from July 13 to September 1, 2019. It was the most viewed tvN drama of 2019, and it is the twelfth-highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history. ==Synopsis== The \"Guest House of the Moon\" is not like any other hotel. A supernatural place, the hotel is not visible in its true form during the daytime as humans can only come across the hotel under special circumstances such as an invitation or lunar eclipse. Its staff and clients are all souls/ghosts coming to terms with unfinished business in their former lives before they pass on to the afterlife and cycle of reincarnation; the staff in particular have been there for decades and even centuries as they have not settled their grudges. The exception to this is the hotel general manager, which has been filled by a succession of human \"passerbys\" since they need to interact normally with the real world in instances like paying bills or fulfilling ghosts' requests with still-living relatives/friends. Some of the more powerful or long-lasting ghosts can make themselves present among humans but they have to abide by the guidelines of the deities Mago and Grim Reaper; for instance killing a human being will usually result in the soul being destroyed without going on to the afterlife. Ghosts can see other ghosts and humans, however only a select few humans such as the Guest House of the Moon manager can see ghosts. Jang Man- wol (Lee Ji-eun) is the owner of this hotel, currently known as the \"Hotel del Luna\" that is located in Myeong-dong, Seoul. Due to a huge sin committed a millennium ago, the hotel catering to the dead has been bound to her soul. As a result of manipulation by the deity Mago (Yi-suk Seo), she meets Gu Chan- sung's father and makes a deal for his son to work for her after 20 years in return for his life and money. With his new found fortune and life, his father takes Gu Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) abroad where the young man grows up as a sincere perfectionist who is level-headed, but also has a soft heart. He comes back to South Korea after his father's death to be an assistant manager at a multinational hotel corporation, only to face Jang Man-wol, after which he ends up fulfilling the agreement and becomes the manager of Hotel Del Luna. Through Gu Chan-sung, the audience is introduced to the mysteries and the secrets behind the Hotel and its owner. ==Cast== ===Main=== Lee Ji-eun and Yeo Jin-goo during an interview for Hotel del Luna * Lee Ji-eun as Jang Man-wol ** Kim Gyu-ri as young Man-wol : The beautiful but moody owner of Hotel del Luna (Guest House of the Moon) for 1,300 years. Initially condemned to be the owner of the hotel to atone for killing many people, her character gradually softens after she meets Gu Chan-sung. After the accidental death of her parents in the wilderness, Man-wol was found unconscious by a merchant and his son. Later she was taken in by Yeon-woo's mother and raised alongside him. After the death of Yeon-woo's mother, the pair remained close as siblings, and grew up to found a clan of bandits that aligned with the rebellion. Upon reaching adulthood, Man- wol was initially warm, smart, and brave, but also sarcastic and ruthless. After robbing princess Song-hwa, who was traveling near the bandits' territory, she met Go Chung-myung, a high-ranking soldier serving the king. After an initial scuffle, the pair fell in love, with Go Chung-myung teaching Man-wol to write her name. After Chung-myung informed Yeon-woo about the threat of princess Song-hwa, Yeon-woo convinced Chung-myung to betray Man-wol in hopes of saving her life. The bandits, including Yeon-woo, were captured by Song-hwa's forces and hanged to death, but Man-wol was spared as an unwitting collaborator. In rage and hatred, Man-wol killed Go Chung-myung and Princess Song-hwa on their wedding night, along with many other guests. Afterwards, she searched for the guest house of moon for the dead to atone for her sins. Once she found it, she became cursed to run the guest house until her heart, now personified by an ancient tree, finally changed. Alternating between being cold/aloof and bad-tempered, she held grudges as the centuries passed until she met Gu Chan-sung and changed for the better. She is known for her love of gaudy and elaborate outfits (over 100 in the series), and frequently drinking champagne. * Yeo Jin-goo as Gu Chan-sung ** Kim Kang-hoon as young Chan-sung : The new general manager of Hotel del Luna, succeeding the previous manager, Noh Joon-suk. He is a handsome Harvard MBA graduate, who is hired as an assistant manager at one of Korea's top hotels. However, due to a deal his father made with Jang Man-wol twenty-one years before, Chan-sung is forced to become the general manager for the Hotel del Luna and overcome his fears in coping with the unseen world of ghosts. Being stoic and rational puts him at odds with Man-wol, particularly curbing her spendthrift and extortionist tendencies. Once he settles in at Hotel del Luna his compassion emerges, with a customer focus tailored to each of the ghost clients, then eagerly learning Man-wol's backstory and protecting her from committing further sins. ===Supporting=== ====At the Hotel del Luna==== * Jung Dong-hwan as No Joon-suk : The hotel's general manager for 30 years who is retiring; Chan-sung's predecessor. * Shin Jung-geun as Kim Seon-bi (formerly Kim Shi-ik) : The longest employee of the hotel and the Sky Bar's bartender.
