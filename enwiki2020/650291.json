    "text": "Mamenchisaurus ( , or spelling pronunciation ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur including several species, known for their remarkably long necks which made up half the total body length. It is known from numerous species which ranged in time from 160 to 145 million years ago, from the Oxfordian age of late Jurassic Period in China. The largest species, which according to Gregory S. Paul was M. sinocanadorum, may have reached in length and possibly weighed 50-80 tonnes (55-88 short tons). ==Discovery== Mounted M. hochuanensis skeleton, Field Museum Mamenchisaurus was first discovered in 1952 on the construction site of the Yitang Highway in Sichuan, China. The partial skeleton fossil was then studied, and named Mamenchisaurus constructus in 1954, by the renowned Chinese paleontologist Professor C. C. Young. The type specimen had an incomplete neck with 14 vertebrae preserved and none of these were complete. M. constructus has been estimated around and in length.Paul, G.S. (2010). The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press.Young, C.C. (1954), On a new sauropod from Yiping, Szechuan, China. sinica, III(4), 481-514. Mamenchisaurus means 'Mamenchi lizard', from the Chinese Pinyin m\u01ce (\u9a6c 'horse') and m\u00e9n (\u95e8 'gate'), while chi is a transliteration of x\u012b (\u6eaa 'stream' or 'brook'), combined with the suffix -saurus (from Greek sauros meaning 'lizard'). It was intended to name the reptile after the place where its fossil was first found\u2014a construction site next to the M\u01cem\u00edngx\u012b (\u9a6c\u9e23\u6eaa) Ferry Crossing by the Jinsha River (\u91d1\u6c99\u6c5f, the westernmost major headwater stream of the Yangtze River), near Yibin (\u5b9c\u5bbe) in Sichuan Province of China. However, due to an accentual mix-up by Young, the location name M\u01cem\u00edngx\u012b (\u9a6c\u9e23\u6eaa 'horse-neighing brook') was mistaken as M\u01cem\u00e9nx\u012b (\u9a6c\u95e8\u6eaa 'horse-gate brook').Origin of the Mamenchisaurus name (in Chinese), Beijing Museum of Natural History website The fact that the first Mamenchisaurus fossil was found as the result of construction work led to Young's naming the type species as Mamenchisaurus constructus. M. jingyanensis skeleton, Beijing Museum of Natural History In 1972, a second species was described, named Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis, with a neck that reached up to in length.Paul, G.S. (1988). \"The brachiosaur giants of the Morrison and Tendaguru with a description of a new subgenus, Giraffatitan, and a comparison of the world's largest dinosaurs\". Hunteria, 2(3): 1\u201314. This species had a complete neck preserved which contained 19 vertebrae.Young, C.C., and Zhao, X.-J. (1972). \"Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis sp. nov.\" Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology Monographs, A, 8:1-30. This was the longest neck known until the description of Supersaurus, based on a single neck vertebra, BYU 9024, with an estimated neck length of about 14 meters (46 feet). Another long-necked sauropod exceeding M. hochuanensis was Sauroposeidon which was discovered in 1994. Based on the Sauroposeidon holotype, which only preserved 4 neck vertebra, its neck was estimated to be between 11.25 and 12 meters (36.9\u201339.4 feet) long.Wedel, M.J., and Cifelli, R.L. (2005). \"Sauroposeidon: Oklahoma\u2019s native giant.\" Oklahoma Geology Notes, 65(2): 40-57. In 1993, M. sinocanadorum was described, which consisted of skull material and the first four cervical vertebrae. This species possessed the longest cervical rib of any described sauropod dinosaur, measuring . This is longer than the longest Sauroposeidon cervical rib, which measures .\"Osteology, paleobiology, and relationships of the sauropod dinosaur Sauroposeidon\", by Mathew J. Wedel, Richard L. Cifelli, and R. Kent Sanders (Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 45, pages 343-388, 2000). Additional remains attributed to this species, but not yet formally described, belong to one of the largest dinosaurs known\u2014the restored skeleton measuring in length. It is named in reference to the China-Canada Dinosaur Project. In 2001, another M. hochuanensis specimen was described. It had skull, pectoral girdle and forelimb material preserved, all of which were missing from the holotype. It was also found with four fused tail vertebra, which have expanded neural arches and taller neural spines, that belong at the tip of the tail. It's thought that these could be a weapon, such as a tail club, or a sensory organ. Other Chinese sauropods, Shunosaurus and Omeisaurus, are also known to have had \u2019tail clubs\u2019 but they differ in shape to that of M. hochuanensis. ===Species=== Size comparison of M. constructus, M. youngi, M. hochuanensis and M. sinocanadorum * M. anyuensis He, Yang, Cai, Li & Liu, 1996. Approximately in length. Known from both the Suining Formation and Penglaizhen Formation. Uranium-lead dating places M. anyuensis at 114.4 Ma in age; as this would make it roughly 30 million years younger than the other Mamenchisaurus species, it is unlikely that M. anyuensis is actually a member of the genus. * M. constructus Young, 1954: (Type species) The holotype specimen, represented by a partial skeleton that was long, from the Hantong Formation. * M. hochuanensis Young & Zhao, 1972: Four partial skeletons.

The species was named in honour of Young. It was a very complete and articulated specimen preserving all the vertebra from the head up until the 8th tail vertebra. It had 18 neck vertebra. At 16 meters (52 ft) long with a 6.5-meter (21 ft) neck, is relatively small among various species of Mamenchisaurus. ==Classification== Artist's impression of M. youngi The cladogram below shows a possible phylogenetic position:J.A.
