Once Seeta (Savitri) his ex-lover, who was forcibly married to a wise person Ramu (Jaggayya) arrives at his hospital and her husband is diagnosed with cancer and terminally ill.

At that point in time, Raghu ensures Radha that he will definitely make Ramu recover. Parallelly, Ramu overhears the conversation, later takes a promise from Seeta that she should marry Raghu after his death. Now Ramu is to undergo major surgery under Raghu which will decide his fate.
