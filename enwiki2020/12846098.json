    "text": "Tra te e il mare is the sixth studio album by Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini. It was released in Italy on 15 September 2000 by CGD East West Records. As of January 2001, the album sold 400,000 copies in Italy, peaking at number 2 on the Italian Albums Chart. The Spanish-language version of the album, titled Entre t\u00fa y mil mares, was released for the hispanophone market on 11 September 2000. It was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Album and Best Engineered Album at the 2nd Latin Grammy Awards, while its producers were nominated for Producer of the Year. The album has sold 4,000,000 copies worldwide. In late 2011, a song named \"Sonambula\" was leaked in the internet. After some polemics claiming that the song was from Pausini's yet to be released album, Pausini confirmed that the 30-second snippet was indeed a demo from \"Entre t\u00fa y mil mares\" that didn't make it to the final cut. The track \"Per Vivere\" was written by Pausini after she went to Rio de Janeiro in early 1997 and saw many children on the street. Since the same year, Pausini makes money donations to the Rom\u00e3o de Matos Duarte institution. ==Track listing== ===Tra te e il mare=== ===Entre t\u00fa y mil mares=== ==Charts and certifications== ===Charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Peak Position |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|38 |- |Dutch Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|40 |- |Finnish Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |- |German Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|34 |- |Italian Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Swedish Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|41 |- |Spanish Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Swiss Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums | style=\"text- align:center;\"|26 |- |U.S. Billboard Latin Pop Albums | style=\"text- align:center;\"|13 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Position |- |Italian Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |Swiss Albums Chart |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |} ===Sales and certifications=== ==Notes== ==References== * \"Song Search\".
