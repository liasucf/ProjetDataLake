    "text": "Ragnar Arthur Granit (30 October 1900 \u2013 12 March 1991) was a Finnish-Swedish scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967 along with Haldan Keffer Hartline and George Wald \"for their discoveries concerning the primary physiological and chemical visual processes in the eye\". ==Early life and education== Ragnar Arthur Granit was born on 30 October 1900 in Riihim\u00e4ki, Finland, at the time part of the Russian Empire, into a Swedish-speaking Finnish family. Granit was raised in Oulunkyl\u00e4, a suburb of the Finnish capital of Helsinki, and attended the Swedish Normal Lyceum in Helsinki. Granit graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Helsinki in 1927. ==Career and research== In 1940, when Finland became the target of a massive Soviet attack during the Winter War, Granit sought refuge \u2013 and peaceful surroundings for his studies and research work \u2013 in Stockholm, the capital of neighbouring Sweden, at the age of 40. In 1941, Granit received Swedish citizenship, which made it possible for him to live and continue with his work without having to worry about the Continuation War, which lasted in Finland until 1945. Granit was proud of his Finnish-Swedish roots and remained a patriotic Finnish-Swede throughout his life, maintaining homes in both in Finland and Sweden after the Moscow Armistice ended the Continuation War and secured Finnish independence. Granit was professor of neurophysiology at the Karolinska Institute from 1946 to his retirement in 1967. ==Awards and honors== In 1960, Granit was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS). In 1967 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Granit said that he was a \"fifty-fifty\" Finnish and Swedish Nobel laureate.Ragnar Granit in the National Biography of Finland: \"There have since been occasional arguments about how many of the observations that led to the Nobel Prize were made only after Granit arrived in Sweden and about whether he is 'a Finnish or a Swedish Nobel laureate'. Granit commented diplomatically on the matter by saying \"fifty-fifty\". When he received his Nobel Prize, Granit was indeed a Swede by citizenship; but a significant amount of his experimental work had been done in Oxford and Helsinki, and even in Stockholm his colleagues were still mostly Finns.\" Photograph of the Finnish/Swedish Nobel prize winner Ragnar Granit receiving the prize from the King of Sweden, Gustaf VI Adolf. ==Death== Granit died on 12 March 1991 in Stockholm at the age of 90. Granit and his wife Marguerite, who died the same year, were buried in a church cemetery on the Finnish island of Korpo. ==References== ==External links== * including the Nobel Lecture December 12, 1967 The Development of Retinal Neurophysiology Category:1900 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:Finnish physicians Category:Finnish Nobel laureates Category:Swedish Nobel laureates Category:Karolinska Institute faculty Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:People from Vantaa Category:Swedish-speaking Finns Category:Finnish neuroscientists Category:Swedish neuroscientists Category:Finnish physiologists Category:Finnish emigrants to Sweden Category:20th-century physicians ",
