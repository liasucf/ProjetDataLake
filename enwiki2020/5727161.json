    "text": "Garhmukteshwar (also spelled Garhmukhteshwar) is a city and a municipal board in Hapur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. ==History== Garhmukteshwar is an ancient place that is mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata. There are claims that it was a part of ancient Hastinapur, the capital of the Pandavas. An ancient fort, repaired by the Maratha leader Mir Bhawan, became, under the British, the headquarters of the tehsil. The name of the town is derived from the temple of Mukteshwar Mahadeva, dedicated to the goddess Ganga who is worshipped there in four temples. The town has 80 sati pillars, marking the spots where Hindu widows are said to have become satimata. The town also has a mosque, built by Gays- ud-din Balban, that bears an inscription in Arabic dating to 682 Hijri (1283 A.D.). ===Partition violence=== Garhmukteshwar was the scene of major anti- Muslim violence in November 1946, at a time when various areas of British India were experiencing significant communal unrest as the partition of the country into India and Pakistan loomed. Gyanendra Pandey describes the place as \"a metaphor for the atrocities of Partition; and Partition itself a metaphor for the kind of extraordinary genocidal violence that was not witnessed again in India, perhaps until 1984\". A mela (fair) held from the town was attended by between 700,000 - 800,000 people and on 6 November 1946 there were a series of attacks on Muslim shopkeepers at the event, resulting in 46 deaths and a further 39 people injured. The assaults and also arson attacks continued on and off for several days at the mela, while the town of Garhmukteshwar itself witnessed a large number of anti-Muslim atrocities, including killings, arson and the destruction of the Muslim quarter. Official reports gave the Muslim death toll in the town as at least 214 people, and there were also quite a lot Hindu deaths in retaliatory attacks. Official investigations into violence in Uttar Pradesh at that time note that there was a \"desire for revenge\" among both Hindus and Muslims, resulting from news of similar violence in Calcutta. ==Climate== Garhmukteshwar has a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate characterised by very hot summers and cool winters.
