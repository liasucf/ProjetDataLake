Davis was named to the Hockey East All-Rookie team, scoring 26 points in 39 games in the 2015-16 season. She would put up 23 points in 35 games the next year, before missing the entire 2017-18 season after having bilateral labrum surgery on both hips. She finished her university career with 142 points in 147 games, being named to the Hockey East First-Team All-Star and MVP of the 2019 Beanpot Tournament in her final year. She was recognised with the Sarah Devens Award in 2020, the first player from Boston University to win the award. Near the end of her university career, she contacted both the NWHL and the PWHPA to explore her professional options, expressing a hope that the two organisations would merge. She would end up being drafted by the NWHL's Boston Pride in April 2020, after they traded for the 1st overall pick from the Toronto expansion team. On the 30th of April 2020, she signed her first professional contract with the Pride. === International === Davis served as assistant captain for Team USA in the 2018 IIHF World Women's U18 Championship, where she scored 3 points in 5 games as the country won gold. == Personal life == Davis has a Master's Degree in Special Education, and has been admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital doctorate program in occupational therapy. In high school, she had done research on a marine lab in the Atlantic Ocean.
