    "text": "Ensign of Royal Canadian Navy since 2013 The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) is tasked to provide maritime security along the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic coasts of Canada, exercise Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic archipelago, and support Canada's multi-national and bilateral interests overseas. It comprises the Pacific Fleet at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Esquimalt, and the Atlantic Fleet at CFB Halifax. CFB Esquimalt is located on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, and is home to 15 vessels and 6,000 staff, the headquarters for Maritime Forces Pacific, Her Majesty's Canadian (HMC) Dockyard Esquimalt, Fleet Maintenance Facility \u2013 Cape Breton (FMF-CB), Fire Fighting and Damage Control School, the Naval Officer Training Centre (NOTC Venture), and extensive housing. CFB Halifax is home port for the 18 vessels of the Canadian Atlantic Fleet and situated in Halifax, Nova Scotia. CFB Halifax employs 7,000 civilians and military staff, and hosts the Canadian Atlantic Fleet headquarters, HMC Dockyard Halifax, FMF Cape Scott, extensive maritime research facilities, an ammunition depot, and the four maritime squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force that deploy helicopters aboard ships. The Canadian Armed Forces are currently constructing a new naval facility at Nanisivik, Baffin Island, to provide a summer port for RCN patrols in the Canadian arctic. With the loss of area air defence capabilities in 2015 (and, temporarily, at-sea replenishment capabilities), the RCN was, at that time, classified as a Rank 5 navy (offshore regional coastal defence) on the Todd-Lindberg classification system, dropping from Rank 3 (multiregional power projection). In 2011, the government restored the traditional name of the Royal Canadian Navy, removed at the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968. Commissioned vessels are designated as 'Her Majesty's Canadian Ship' (HMCS), minor ships as 'Patrol Craft Training' (PCT) and auxiliaries as 'Canadian Forces Auxiliary Vessel' (CFAV). ==Submarines== St John's harbour on Newfoundland The Victoria class are British built diesel-electric fleet submarines designed in the late 1970s to supplement the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine force. They were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War. In 1998, Canada purchased the submarines to replace the aging s. Refit for Canadian service included the removal of Sub-Harpoon missile firing and mine-laying capabilities, installation of torpedo launch systems and upgrades to weapons and fire control systems. Each vessel holds 53 crew. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:80%;\" |- valign=\"top\" ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Ship ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Pennant ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Armament ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Displacement ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Propulsion ! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" | Service |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" | Builder ! scope=\"col\" | Laid down ! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned ! scope=\"col\" | Fleet |- valign=\"center\" | || SSK 876 | rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | *6 \u00d7 530 mm torpedo tubes *18 \u00d7 Mark 48 torpedoes | rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" | * 2,220 t surfaced * 2,439 t submerged | rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | *Diesel-electric () *2 Paxman Valenta 16 RPA diesel generators, *2 GEC, motor-generators | Cammell Laird||12 August 1987|| December 2000 ||Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || SSK 877 | Cammell Laird||13 March 1990|| October 2003 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || SSK 878 | Cammell Laird||10 January 1989||March 2003 ||Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || SSK 879 | * 2,296 t surfaced * 2,540 t submerged | Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering ||February 1983|| September 2015 ||Pacific |} ==Frigates== HMCS Halifax en route to Haiti in January 2010 as part of Operation Hestia' The s are multi-role vessels with anti-submarine, anti-aircraft and anti-ship capability. In response to recent global security interests, the role of the class has shifted from open ocean to littoral engagement. Innovations in operational tactics have allowed the vessels of this class to adapt to new asymmetric surface threats. To ensure effective long-term capacity in this new threat environment the ships are undergoing a refit, including passive and active weapons, radars, and new combat architecture to meet the modern requirements. As of 2018, all twelve ships had been refitted. Each holds a complement of 225 officers and crew. All ships of the class are named after major Canadian cities. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:80%;\" |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Pennant ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Service |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" | Builder ! scope=\"col\" | Laid down ! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned ! scope=\"col\" | Fleet |- valign=\"center\" | || FFH 330 | align= center rowspan=12 | *24 Honeywell Mk 46 torpedoes *16 Evolved Sea-Sparrow SAM *8 RGM-84 Harpoon SSM *1 57 mm Bofors Mk2 gun *1 20 mm Vulcan Phalanx CIWS *6 .50 caliber machine guns *1 CH-148 Cyclone | align= center rowspan=12 | * 3,995 t (light) * 4,795 t (operational) * 5,032 t (deep load) | align= center rowspan=12 | *2 LM2500 Gas turbines *1 SEMT Pielstick Diesel engine | Saint John Shipbuilding ||19 March 1987 || 29 June 1992 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 331 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 19 May 1988 || 23 August 1993 || Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 332 | Davie Shipbuilding || 16 December 1988 || 14 July 1994 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 333 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 22 April 1989 || 29 July 1993 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 334 | Davie Shipbuilding || 6 October 1989 || 29 December 1993|| Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 335 | Davie Shipbuilding || 15 June 1991 || 12 May 1995 || Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 336 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 8 February 1991 || 21 July 1994 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 337 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 25 April 1992 || 10 September 1994 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 338 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 20 March 1993 || 23 June 1995 || Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 339 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 18 December 1993 ||9 September 1995 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 340 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 24 August 1994 ||16 June 1996 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || FFH 341 | Saint John Shipbuilding || 29 April 1995 ||28 September 1996 || Pacific |} ==Maritime coastal defence vessels== HMCS Brandon, a maritime coastal defence vessel The s are multi-role vessels built and launched from the mid- to late-1990s and are crewed by a combination of Naval Reserve and Regular-Force personnel. Each vessel displaces 970 t and runs with a complement of between 31 and 47 officers and crew. Their main missions are counter narcotics, coastal surveillance, sovereignty patrol, route survey, and training. The ships' capabilities include a mechanical minesweeping system, a route survey system, and a bottom object inspection vehicle. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:80%;\" |- valign=\"top\" ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Ship ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Pennant ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Armament ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Displacement ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Propulsion ! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" | Service |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" | Builder ! scope=\"col\" | Laid down ! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned ! scope=\"col\" | Fleet |- valign=\"center\" | || MM 700 | rowspan=\"12\" align=\"center\" | * 2 \u00d7 M2 machine guns * 1 \u00d7 Bofors 40 mm/60 Mk 5C gun | rowspan=\"12\" align=\"center\" |970 t | rowspan=\"12\" align=\"center\" | *2 \u00d7 Jeumont DC electric motors *4 \u00d7 600VAC W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 SACM V12 diesel alternators |Halifax Shipyards||12 December 1994|| 21 September 1996 ||Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || MM 701 |Halifax Shipyards||28 April 1995|| 26 October 1996 || Atlantic |- valign=\"top\" | || MM 702 |Halifax Shipyards||11 August 1995||10 May 1997 ||Pacific |- valign=\"top\" | || MM 703 |Halifax Shipyards||8 December 1995|| 21 June 1997 ||Pacific |- | |MM 704 |Halifax Shipyards |26 April 1996 |14 June 1997 |Atlantic |- | |MM 705 |Halifax Shipyards |26 July 1996 |17 April 1998 |Pacific |- | |MM 706 |Halifax Shipyards |7 November 1996 |18 April 1998 |Pacific |- | |MM 707 |Halifax Shipyards |22 February 1997 |26 July 1998 |Atlantic |- | |MM 708 |Halifax Shipyards |31 May 1997 |12 July 1998 |Atlantic |- | |MM 709 |Halifax Shipyards |5 September 1997 |5 December 1998 |Pacific |- | |MM 710 |Halifax Shipyards |6 December 1997 |5 June 1999 |Pacific |- | |MM 711 |Halifax Shipyards |28 March 1998 |18 July 1999 |Atlantic |} ==Patrol craft training vessels== PCT Orca amongst the Gulf Islands off British Columbia. 2007 s are primarily used for one-to-six-week long 'at sea' naval officer training. Regular force boatswains, engineers and naval communicators serve in these ships to train junior officers and non-commissioned sailors. They also patrol coastal waters for pollution infractions and fishing violations, and are frequently tasked for search and rescue operations. They operate year-round in the coastal waters of British Columbia. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:80%;\" |- !Name !Pennant number !Commissioned !Builder !Fleet |- | Orca || PCT 55 || 9 November 2006 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Raven || PCT 56 ||15 March 2007 || Victoria Shipyards|| Pacific |- | Caribou || PCT 57 ||31 July 2007 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Renard || PCT 58 ||13 September 2007 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Wolf || PCT 59 ||29 November 2007 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Grizzly || PCT 60 ||19 March 2008 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Cougar|| PCT 61 ||2 October 2008 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |- | Moose || PCT 62 || 27 November 2008 || Victoria Shipyards || Pacific |} ==Support and auxiliary vessels== HMCS Oriole is the oldest commissioned ship in the navy. ===Interim Auxiliary Replenishment Vessel=== * ===Sail training ships=== * (KC 480) *HMSTV Goldcrest (KC 2355) *HMSTV Tuna (KC 2372) ===Torpedo and sound ranging vessels=== *CFAV Sikanni (YTP 611) *CFAV Stikine (YTP 613) ===Yard diving tenders=== *Unnamed (YDT 11) *CFAV Granby (YDT 12) *CFAV Tonnerre (YDT 21) *CFAV Sechelt (YDT 610) *CFAV Sooke (YDT 612) ===Fireboats=== * (YTR 561) \u2013 retired in 2014 and awaiting disposal * (YTR 562) ===Tugboats=== * * * * * * * * * * * ===Yard auxiliary general=== *CFAV Pelican (YAG 4) *CFAV Gemini (YAG 650) *CFAV Pegasus (YAG 651) *CFAV Albatross (YAG 661) *CFAV Black Duck (YAG 660) ==Development and procurement== Harry DeWolf under construction in May 2018 German The RCN is undergoing a complex program of capacity expansion, ship life extension, modernization and fleet procurement. The Nanisivik Naval Facility on Baffin Island in the arctic will provide shore services for fleet operations in the arctic during the four month summer season. The National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy will invest more than $60 billion into the development of Arctic capable patrol vessels, frigate-class surface warships, and long-range auxiliary supply vessels. Construction has begun on the six vessels under the Arctic Patrol Ship Project. (A further two AOPS are planned for the Canadian Coast Guard). The commercial containership is currently in service as a fleet supply vessel, to meet operational requirements until the two new s are completed. While up to 15 warships of the Canadian Surface Combatant/Type 26 frigate program remain in the planning stages, the RCN has upgraded all current frigates with advanced systems and life extension maintenance to maximize operational capability into the 2030s. In addition to the fleet component, the Canadian Armed Forces has replaced the former CH-124 Sea King helicopters with the CH-148 Cyclone. The first six Cyclones were delivered June 2015 followed by a further two Block 1.1 Cyclones in November/December 2015. As of February 2019, 17 interim Cyclones had been delivered and the aircraft had reached initial operating capability. In May 2019, it was announced that the Skeldar V-200 UAV would be acquired for both the RCN and Canadian Special Forces. As a light helicopter UAV, it will be capable of operating from a range of RCN vessels. On 29 April 2019 Ocean Industries was awarded a contract to build four tugboats to replace both the Fire-class fireboat (one retired in 2014) and Glen-class tugs to be delivered beginning in 2021. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- | Displacement | Ship displacement at full load |- | Propulsion | Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated |- | Service | The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate |- | Laid down | The date the keel began to be assembled |- | Launched | The date the ship was launched |} ==See also== * Royal Canadian Navy * Origins of the Royal Canadian Navy * History of the Royal Canadian Navy * List of ships of the Royal Canadian Navy * Hull classification symbol (Canada) * Her Majesty's Canadian Ship * List of aircraft of the Royal Canadian Navy == References == ==Bibliography and further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * 01 .
