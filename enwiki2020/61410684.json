FEPASA had promised many news for the station, such as cafeterias, newsstands, public phones and restrooms, but none of them was made. Actually, the station was reopened without lighting in the platforms and ticket gates, the ticket offices were working in an improvised location with wood fences, and there was a great grap in the platforms, projected to receive the French trains, which started operating in 1979. The new building, made with concrete molds, occupied a area and could receive an average of 26,000 passengers per day in its platforms of of extension. To contain the income evasion, FEPASA also predicted to build concrete walls through all the line extension, with gaps between each block, where flower gardens would be made. Since 1996, it belongs to CPTM. Besides the name of the politician is currently spelled \"Domingos de Morais\", the company preferred to keep the original spelling as \"Moraes\".
