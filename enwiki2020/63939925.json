    "text": "Progress MS-14 (), Russian production No. 448, identified by NASA as Progress 75P, is a Progress spacecraft launched by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). This is the 166th flight of a Progress spacecraft. == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. == Spacecraft == This flight was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of Victory: the Ribbon of Saint George and the orders of the Second World War were put on board the Soyuz. In order to prevent the Progress MS-14 coronavirus from entering the station, it underwent additional disinfection before launch before being sent. First of all, disinfection of the internal surfaces and equipment, as well as the external surfaces of the goods delivered was carried out with the selection of control samples. After refueling the vessel and upgrading the equipment, additional disinfection was carried out to prevent the virus from entering the ISS. == Launch == The Soyuz-2.1a used to launch Progress MS-14, dubbed the \"Victory Rocket\" was decorated with the number \"75\" on its payload fairing to mark the 75th anniversary of the meeting of U.S. and Soviet troops on the Elbe River in Germany in the final days of World War II in Europe. The number has a double significance because the cargo mission is the 75th Progress resupply flight to the International Space Station since 2000. Progress MS-14 was launched at 01:51:41 UTC from Baikonur Site 31/6 on a fast-track trajectory. Following a nominal launch, Progress MS-14 docked with the Zvezda port on the ISS at 05:11:56 UTC. == Docking == And 3 hours 20 minutes after the launch, Progress MS-14 successfully docked automatically at the aft port of the Zvezda at 05:11:56 UTC, where it is expected to remain until December 2020. After its mission is complete, it will depart and re- enter the Earth's atmosphere for destruction over the South Pacific Ocean. == Cargo == The Progress MS-14 spacecraft delivered 2528 kg of cargo, with 1358 kg of this being dry cargo. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Dry cargo: 1358 kg * Fuel: 700 kg * Oxygen: 50 kg * Water: 420 kg == Undocking and decay == The Progress MS-14 is scheduled to remain docked at the station through late 2020, when it will depart with trash and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere for destruction over the South Pacific Ocean. == See also == * Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station == References == Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2020 Category:2020 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets ",
