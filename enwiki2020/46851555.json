In November 1942, during the Second World War, it was attacked in the Indian Ocean by two Japanese commerce raiders, one of which (the Hokoku Maru) was sunk possibly by a shell fired by the Ondina. After the war it continued operating until decommissioned and broken up in 1959. == Description == Displacing , Ondina was long with a beam of . The vessel had a draught of . Fitted with a single Werkspoor six-cylinder diesel engine that was capable of generating 2,800 hp, the ship had a top speed of 12 knots. Its armament consisted of a single 102 mm quick-firing gun and several machine guns. == Career == Launched in April 1939, Ondina was built at the NDSM shipyard in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Completed in August 1939, prior to the Second World War the vessel sailed for La Corona, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell company. === Second World War === In November 1942, Ondina took part in the battle against the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and raiders Aikoku Maru and Hokoku Maru where it was damaged; after which it was temporarily repaired and then sent to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia where she was stationed from 22 June 1943 supplying fuel to US submarines. On 1 September 1943 the Ondina also supplied fuel to the ship MV Krait then taking part in Operation Jaywick, the raid on Singapore. At the end of 1943 the ship was sent to the US for repairs at Tampa, sailing via Melbourne, Balboa, Panama Canal and Galveston. ==== Action against Japanese raiders ==== On 11 November 1942, Ondina was sailing escorted by HMIS Bengal, a Bathurst class corvette, to the southwest of Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean, when the Japanese commerce raiders Aikoku Maru and H\u014dkoku Maru attacked them. The Japanese ships were each armed with eight 5.5-inch guns, while Ondina had only a 102 mm gun and Bengal a single 3-inch weapon. Both Allied ships scored hits in the H\u014dkoku Maru which blew up and sank; the other raider escaped. Ondina was so damaged in the action that the captain ordered \"abandon ship\" after which he died. With the tanker's crew in lifeboats, the Japanese killed some with machine gun fire, rescued the majority of the crew of their sunken companion, and retired. Ondina did not sink, so its crew reboarded, repaired some of the damage, and reached port safely. === Postwar === Ondina was decommissioned and scrapped in 1959, at Hong Kong. == See also == * Japanese raiders in the Indian Ocean == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === * == External links == * Category:1939 ships Category:Oil tankers Category:Tankers of the Netherlands Category:World War II tankers Category:World War II merchant ships of the Netherlands Category:South-East Asian theatre of World War II Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan ",
