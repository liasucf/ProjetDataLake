    "text": "There are a number of passages in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that have been interpreted as involving same-sex sexual acts and desires. These interpretations form the basis of Jewish and Christian attitudes towards homosexuality. == Hebrew Bible == === Leviticus 18 and 20 === Chapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus form part of the Holiness code and list prohibited forms of intercourse, including the following verses: *\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" Chapter 18 verse 22 Bible Gateway provides 42 other English translations of the verse. *\"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\" Chapter 20 verse 13. Bible Gateway provides 42 other English translations of the verse. These two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general. More recent interpretations focus more on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the polytheistic Canaanites. The Hebrew Bible only prohibits this practice for men. This is clearly seen by contrasting these verses with Lev. 18:23 and 20:15-16 respectively, where sex with animals is prohibited for both men and women. More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of the Israelites from the Canaanites. One of those interpretations is from Janet Edmonds, which says: > \"To interpret these passages of Leviticus, it\u2019s important to know that this > book of the Bible focuses on ritual purity for the Israelites, and setting > guidelines for the Israelites to distinguish themselves from their pagan > neighbors, the Egyptians and Canaanites, who lived in the lands before they > were settled by the Jews. This is shown in Leviticus Chapters 18 and 20 by > three specific scripture passages (Leviticus 18:2-3, 18:24 and 20:23) that > state that the Israelites should never do what the Egyptians and Canaanites > did.\" === Sodom and Gomorrah === Lot prevents Sodomites from raping the angels, by Heinrich Aldegrever, 1555 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, John Martin, 1852 The story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Some interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests more than homosexuality, but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape, or have sex with, the angels who retrieved Lot. While the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom, the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name \"Sodom\" became the basis of the word \"sodomy\", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex. While the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom, Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice as well as its commission of 'abomination': The Talmudic tradition as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in Matthew 10:14\u201315 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will not welcome them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Later traditions on Sodom's sin, such as Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse. In Jude 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been \"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh\", which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels. Jewish writers Philo (d. AD 50) and Josephus (37 \u2013 c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom. By the end of the 1st century AD, Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices. === David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi === The account of the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream writers as a relationship of affectionate regard. It has also been interpreted by some authors as of a sexual nature.Boswell, John. Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe. New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135\u2013137)Halperin, David M. One Hundred Years of Homosexuality. New York: Routledge, 1990. (p. 83) Theologian Theodore Jennings identifies the story as one of desire for David by both Saul and Jonathan, stating, \"Saul's jealousy has driven [David] into Jonathan's arms.\" Michael Coogan addresses the claim of their homosexual relationship and explicitly rejects it. One relevant Bible passage on this issue is 1 Samuel 18:1: *When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. (NRSV) Another relevant passage is 2 Samuel 1:26, where David says: *I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. (NRSV) The story of Ruth and Naomi in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted by contemporary scholars as the story of a lesbian couple. Coogan states that the Hebrew Bible does not even mention lesbianism. == New Testament == === Romans 1:26\u201327 === This passage, part of a larger discourse in 1:18-32, has been debated by some 20th and 21st century interpreters as to its relevance today, what it actually prohibits and whether it represents Paul's view or rhetoric that Paul is actively arguing against. Clement of Alexandria and John Chrysostom regard it as concerning female and male homosexual intercourse, while Augustine of Hippo views it as referring to heterosexual and homosexual anal sex.Bernadette J. Brooten: Patristic Interpretations of Romans 1:26, in: Elizabeth E. Livingstone (ed.), Studia Patristica XVIII, vol. 1, Kalamazoo 1985, p. 287-291. Although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity, some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity or that Paul's condemnation was relative to his own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. These interpretations are, however, in a minority. Scholars, noting that Romans 1:18\u201332 represents an exception in the book of Romans as a whole and uses vocabulary elsewhere not seen in Paul's letters, have for decades puzzled over the passage. Several scholars believe these verses are part of a much larger non-Pauline interpolation, a later addition to the letter.Percy Neale Harrison, Paulines and Pastorals (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80-85; Robert Martyr Hawkins, The Recovery of the Historical Paul (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, The Origins of the New Testament (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., The Birth of the Christian Religion (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter, SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C. O'Neill, Paul's Letter to the Romans (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1975), 40-56; William O. Walker, Jr., \"Romans 1.18\u20132.29: A Non-Pauline Interpolation?\" New Testament Studies 45, no. 4 (1999): 533-52. Others argue that the grammar of the Greek original demands that Romans 1:18-32 be read as a rhetorical set-up, a summary of Hellenistic Jewish legalist rhetoric that Paul actively forbids followers of Christ from using in Romans 2. === 1 Corinthians 6:9\u201311; 1 Timothy 1:8\u201311 === In the context of the broader immorality of his audience, Paul the Apostle wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 6 verses 9-11: In 1 Timothy 1:8\u201311, Paul the Apostle states: In the letter to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakia () and arsenokoitai (). Arsenokoitai is a compound word. Compound words are formed when two or more words are put together to form a new word with a new meaning. In this case, arsenokoitai is from the Greek words 'arrh\u0113n / ars\u0113n' () meaning \"male\", and koit\u0113n () meaning \"bed\", with a sexual connotation. A direct translation would be \u201cmale-bed\u201d. Its first recorded use was by Paul in 1 Corinthians and later in 1 Timothy 1 (attributed to Paul). Some scholars consider Paul to have adapted this word by translating, to Greek, the verse from Leviticus 20:13 \u201cmales who lie with males.\u201d with additional adaption from the wording of the Septuagint translations of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:23\" Due to its unclear definition, English translators struggled with representing the concept of arsenokoitai. It has been variously rendered as \"sodomites\" (NRSV), \"abusers of themselves with mankind\" (KJV), \"men who have sex with men\" (NIV) or \"practicing homosexuals\" (NET) Malakia (\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1, \"softness\", \"weakliness\") is an ancient Greek word that, in relation to men, has sometimes been translated as \"effeminacy\". Also translates to \u201cof things subject to touch, \"soft\" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, \"gentle\"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include \"pathic\". However, in modern Greek it has come to mean \"masturbation\", and its derivative \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u2013 malakas means \"one who masturbates\". ====Interpretation==== Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a \"soft\" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or \"those who abuse themselves\"; all that is factually known about the word is that it means \"soft\".Robinson 2012 Most scholars hold that Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, and , in mind when he used the word \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (which may be of his coinage) with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it \"did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers\", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of arsenokoitia as active or passive and says that \"many men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives\".\u03a4\u1f78 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u1fe6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (Migne PG 88, col. 1896). Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term arsenokoites by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be \"consistent with a homosexual meaning\". A discussion document issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word arsenokoites relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of 80 days for \"intercourse of men with one another\" (canon 9), explained in the Pedalion as mutual masturbation \u2013 double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) \u2013 and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, 15 without (canon 18) for being \"so mad as to copulate with another man\" \u2013 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 in the original \u2013 explained in the Pedalion as \"guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)\" \u2013 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, but this is not the case if the semen was ejaculated between his thighs (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the Pedalion, the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title The Rudder.Text in the original Greek language, pp. 562\u2013578 Some scholars consider that the term was not used to refer to a homosexual orientation, but argue that it referred instead to sexual activity. Other scholars have interpreted arsenokoitai and malakoi (another word that appears in ) as referring to weakness and effeminacy or to the practice of exploitative pederasty. === Jesus's discussion of marriage === In Matthew 19 and parallel in Mark 10, Jesus is asked if a man can divorce his wife. In that context, Jesus replies: Robert A. J. Gagnon, a theologian, argues that Jesus's back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\".Robert A. J. Gagnon, \"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G. Myers and Letha Dawson Scanzoni, What God Has Joined Together?\" Reformed Review 59.1 (Autumn 2005): 19-130, 56. Available online at On the other hand, Bart Ehrman, Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, states of Jesus's references to Genesis 1 and 2, \"Yeah, [Jesus is] not actually defining marriage. He's answering a specific question.\" Ehrman notes further \"And here the conversation is quite easy. In our surviving records Jesus says nothing about same-sex acts or sexual orientation. Nothing. Nada.\" === Matthew 8; Luke 7 === In Matthew 8:5\u201313 and Luke 7:1\u201310, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the Greek word pais, used in this account, was sometimes given a sexual meaning. Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is \"boy\", \"child\" or \"slave\" and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of Liddell and Scott and Bauer. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word \u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 (pais): a child in relation to descent (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word \"pais\" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave. Matthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1\u201310 and John 4:46\u201353. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2\u20136 being present also in Matthew. The Commentary of Craig A. Evans states that the word pais used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as Q used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became doulos (slave) in Luke and huios (son) in John. Writers who admit John 4:46\u201353 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's pais as \"child\" or \"boy\", while those who exclude it see it as meaning \"servant\" or \"slave\". Theodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the pais in Matthew's account is the centurion's \"boy-love\" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that, while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports \"neither of these interpretations\", with Wendy Cotter saying that they fail to take account of Jewish condemnation of pederasty. === Matthew 19:12 === In Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Jesus's reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted by some commentators as having to do with homosexual orientation; Clement of Alexandria, for instance, cites in his book \"Stromata\" (chapter III,1,1Clemente de Alejandria: Stromata II-III, Fuentes Patristicas, vol.10 (Marcelo Merino Rodriguez ed.), Madrid 1998, p. 315) an earlier interpretation from Basilides that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry. \"The first category \u2013 those eunuchs who have been so from birth \u2013 is the closest description we have in the Bible of what we understand today as homosexual.\" === Acts 8 === The Ethiopian eunuch, an early Gentile convert described in Acts 8, has been interpreted by some commentators as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word \"eunuch\" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12. Some religious commentators suggest that the combination of \"eunuch\" together with the title \"court official\" indicates a literal eunuch who would have been excluded from the Temple by the restriction in Deuteronomy 23:1. == See also == * Biblical law in Christianity * Christianity and homosexuality * Homosexuality and Judaism * Homosexuality in ancient Greece * Malakia * Homosexuality and religion * Women in Christianity * Abomination (Judaism) * Sexuality of Jesus ==Notes== == References == == Bibliography == * Amsel, Nachum.
