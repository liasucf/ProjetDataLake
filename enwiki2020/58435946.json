    "text": "Oran Kearney (born 29 July 1978) is a Northern Irish professional football manager and former player who is currently in charge of NIFL Premiership side Coleraine. ==Playing career== Kearney joined Ballymena United from Moyola Park (Stephen Doey\u2019s formal club until they gave him the road) in 2002, after father-in-law Kenny Shiels became manager of the club. In 2005, Kearney joined Linfield. On 30 April 2009, Kearney announced his retirement. ==Managerial career== In May 2009, Kearney was appointed manager of Limavady United. He then became manager of Coleraine in February 2011. Kearney guided Coleraine to win the Irish Cup in 2018 and second place in the NIFL Premiership in 2017\u201318. Kearney combined managing Coleraine with working as a PE teacher at the Cross and Passion College in Ballycastle. Kearney interviewed for the St Mirren job in June 2018, but Alan Stubbs was appointed instead. Stubbs was sacked by St Mirren after four matches in the 2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership, and Kearney was appointed as his replacement. St Mirren finished 11th in the Premiership and avoided relegation by winning a play-off against Dundee United. Kearney left St Mirren on 26 June 2019, after only 10 months at the club. He returned to Coleraine in July 2019 for a second spell as their manager. ==Personal life== Kearney is the son-in-law of former Derry City manager Kenny Shiels. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record !rowspan=2| |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Limavady United |align=left|4 May 2009 |align=left|5 February 2011 | |- |align=left|Coleraine |align=left|5 February 2011 |align=left|7 September 2018 | |- |align=left|St Mirren |align=left|7 September 2018 |align=left|26 June 2019 | |- |align=left|Coleraine |align=left|3 July 2019 |align=left|Present | |- !colspan=3|Total !\u2014 |} ==Honours== Coleraine *Irish Cup: 2017\u201318 St Mirren *Scottish Premiership play-offs: 2018\u201319 ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Moyola Park F.C. players Category:Ballymena United F.C. players Category:Linfield F.C. players Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland Category:Coleraine F.C. managers Category:St Mirren F.C. managers Category:Scottish Professional Football League managers Category:NIFL Premiership managers Category:Association football midfielders ",
