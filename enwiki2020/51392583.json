    "text": "The Bal\u0131kesir\u2013Band\u0131rma Regional, numbered as B32TCDD regional trains - tcdd.gov.tr (), is a long passenger train operating daily between Bal\u0131kesir and Band\u0131rma. The train is a temporary replacement for the 6th of September Express and the 17th of September Express which operate only between \u0130zmir and Soma, due to a tunnel collapse on the Manisa-Band\u0131rma railway. Once construction on rebuilding the tunnel is complete and regular train service from \u0130zmir to Band\u0131rma returns, the Bal\u0131kesir-Band\u0131rma Regional will be discontinued. ==References== Category:Passenger rail transport in Turkey ",
