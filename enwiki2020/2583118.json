    "text": "Sir Michael Livesey Sir Michael Livesey, 1st Baronet, MP (1611\u20131663), was a Parliamentarian Colonel of Kentish Yeomanry and one of the regicides of King Charles I. A baronet, seated at Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey, Livesey was a zealous Puritan who sided with Parliament during the Civil War. ==Life== An active County Committee member, he was appointed Sheriff of Kent in 1643. Livesey commanded Kent Yeomanry, but in 1644, amid accusations of cowardice and threats of mutiny, he challenged the authority of Sir William Waller and detached his cavalry from Waller's command. A partial reconciliation was reached when their disagreement was brought before the Committee for Both Kingdoms in September 1644, and Livesey's troops rejoined Waller's army until the spring of 1645. Livesey refused to serve in the New Model Army and his regiment was taken over by Henry Ireton. In September 1645, Livesey was elected recruiter MP for Queenborough, Kent, and emerged as a radical Independent and Republican. When pro-Royalist riots broke out in Kent in December 1647, Livesey was sent to quell them; he remained in the south-east during 1648, quelling a 600-strong pro-Royalist riot in Horsham and harshly suppressed further suspected Royalist activity in the county. During July, he pursued the Earl of Holland's insurgents after they attempted to capture Reigate Castle, and then defeated them at Kingston in Surrey, thus ending the threat of a Royalist uprising in the environs of London. Appointed a Commissioner, Livesey was a signatory to the King's death warrant and was an active Member of the Rump Parliament, where he emerged as deeply hostile to Royalists and Papists. Like other Republicans, he opposed the establishment of the Protectorate in 1653, but occupied himself with local duties: he served as High Sheriff of Kent between 1655 and 1656. Denounced as a regicide at the Restoration, he and his wife fled to the Low Countries. Sir Michael died in 1663,Livesey Memorial at All Saints', Eastchurch, Kent and Dame Elizabeth Livesey, daughter of Sir Henry Fynes (1587\u20131641), died without issue in 1666. ==See also== * Livesey baronets ==References== Category:1611 births Category:1663 deaths Category:People from the Isle of Sheppey Category:History of Kent Category:Regicides of Charles I Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:High Sheriffs of Kent Category:English MPs 1640\u20131648 Category:English MPs 1648\u20131653 ",
