Chin En-y\u016b (\u9673\u5ef6\u7950, Chen Yanyou in Mandarin Chinese), a medical doctor in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, moved to Japan as the Yuan Dynasty was replaced by the Ming Dynasty. He arrived in Hakata, and practiced medicine, calling himself Chin Gair\u014d (\u9673\u5916\u90ce, Chen Wailang), using the title of his Yuan Dynasty government. He was invited several times to Kyoto to serve Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the sh\u014dgun, but he declined. He later became a Buddhist monk, assumed the name of Sokei (\u5b97\u656c), and died in Hakata. History of Uir\u014d (in Japanese) His son, S\u014dki (\u5b97\u5947), moved to Kyoto, and was sent to his father's home town of Taizhou, China. He brought the recipe for Reih\u014dtan medicine (\u970a\u5b9d\u4e39), which was such an effective medicine for many diseases that it was given the name of \"T\u014dchink\u014d\" (\u900f\u9802\u9999) by the emperor because of its special fragrance. It was also called Uir\u014d, an alternative of the Zhejiang pronunciation of \"Wailang\", the government title of his father. S\u014dki entertained foreign guests with special cakes, which were called \"Uir\u014d cakes\". J\u014dyu, S\u014dki's son, was a man of high esteem. His son, Soden (\u7956\u7530), was also so respected that Soden's eldest son, Sadaharu (\u5b9a\u6cbb), was given the family name of Uno (\u5b87\u91ce) by sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Uno Sadaharu moved to Odawara in 1504 at the invitation of Hojo Soun and the descendants of Chin Gair\u014d have made Uir\u014d medicine there ever since. Recent research Uir\u014d Family and Its T\u014dchink\u014d Medicine, a doctorate thesis by Shigeru SUGIYAMA (Pharmaceutical Department of Chiba University, 1996) (in Japanese) shows that Uir\u014d medicine was available in both Kyoto and Odawara until the Genroku Period of the late 17th century. Uir\u014d cakes became available in Odawara during the Meiji Period in the late 19th century. Later as per Japanesse newspaper Dr. Naturo relative of Sokei will practice Uir\u014d for the Ming Dynasty. ==Medicine== Uir\u014d medicine comes in small silvery pills, much like Jintan pills. A typical package contains 428 pills in three plastic bags. It is considered a good remedy for stomachache, headache, giddiness, and other routine conditions. Its ingredients include ginseng, musk, borneol, and cinnamon bark.
