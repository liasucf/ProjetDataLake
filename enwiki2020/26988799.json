    "text": "Luxembourg was represented by Monique Melsen, with the song '\"Pomme, pomme, pomme\", at the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 3 April in Dublin. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL. Melsen was only the second Luxembourg native (after Camillo Felgen) to represent the Grand Duchy at Eurovision. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Melsen performed 8th in the running order, following France and preceding the United Kingdom. With its metronomic rhythm and facile lyrics, \"Pomme, pomme, pomme\" is often cited as a particularly childish and inane song, even by Eurovision standards, and frequently features in montages of Eurovision's more infelicitous musical moments. It only had one backup singer and that was the only performance in the contest which others had none or more than one. At the close of voting it had received 70 points, placing Luxembourg 13th of the 18 entries.ESC History - Luxembourg 1971 == See also == *Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1971 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 Category:Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1971 in Luxembourg ",
