    "text": "The Raunki\u00e6r system is a system for categorizing plants using life-form categories, devised by Danish botanist Christen C. Raunki\u00e6r and later extended by various authors. Life forms ==History== It was first proposed in a talk to the Danish Botanical Society in 1904 as can be inferred from the printed discussion of that talk, but not the talk itself, nor its title. The journal, Botanisk Tidsskrift, published brief comments on the talk by M.P. Porsild, with replies by Raunki\u00e6r. A fuller account appeared in French the following year.Raunki\u00e6r, C. (1905) Types biologiques pour la g\u00e9ographie botanique. Oversigt over Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Forhandlinger, 1905, 347-438. Raunki\u00e6r elaborated further on the system and published this in Danish in 1907.Raunki\u00e6r, C. (1907) Planterigets Livsformer og deres Betydning for Geografien. Gyldendalske Boghandel - Nordisk Forlag, K\u00f8benhavn and Kristiania. 132 pp., (PDF).Ch. 2 in Raunki\u00e6r (1934): The life-forms of plants and their bearings on geography, p. 2-104. The original note and the 1907 paper were much later translated to English and published with Raunki\u00e6r's collected works.Ch. 1 in Raunki\u00e6r (1934): Biological types with reference to the adaption of plants to survive the unfavourable season, p. 1.Raunki\u00e6r, C. (1934) The Life Forms of Plants and Statistical Plant Geography, being the collected papers of C. Raunki\u00e6r. Translated by H. Gilbert-Carter, A. Fausb\u00f8ll, and A. G. Tansley. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Reprinted 1978 (ed. by Frank N. Egerton), Ayer Co Pub., in the \"History of Ecology Series\". . Note: These are not all of Raunki\u00e6r's publications, only those on plant form and geography. ==Modernization== Raunki\u00e6r's life-form scheme has subsequently been revised and modified by various authors,Ellenberg. H. & D. Mueller-Dombois (1967). A key to Raunki\u00e6r plant life-forms with revised subdivisions. Ber. Goebot. Inst. ETH. Stiftg Rubel. Zurich. 37:56-73, .M\u00fcller-Dombois, D. & H. Ellenberg (1974) Aims and methods in vegetation ecology. John Wiley & Sons, New York. Reprint 2003, Blackburn Press, Shimwell, D.W. (1971) The Description and Classification of Vegetation. Sidgwick & Jackson, London. but the main structure has survived. Raunki\u00e6r's life-form system may be useful in researching the transformations of biotas and the genesis of some groups of phytophagous animals. ==Subdivisions== The subdivisions of the Raunki\u00e6r system are premised on the location of the bud of a plant during seasons with adverse conditions, i. e. cold seasons and dry seasons: ===Phanerophytes=== These plants, normally woody perennials, grow stems into the air, with their resting buds being more than 50 cm above the soil surface, e.g. trees and shrubs, and also epiphytes, which Raunki\u00e6r later separated as a distinct class (see below). Raunki\u00e6r further divided the phanerophytes according to height as *Megaphanerophytes, *Mesophanerophytes, *Microphanerophytes, and *Nanophanerophytes. Further division was premised on the characters of duration of foliage, i. e. evergreen or deciduous, and presence of covering bracts on buds, for 8 classes. 3 further divisions were made to increase the total of classes to 12: *Phanerophytic stem succulents, *Phanerophytic epiphytes, and *Phanerophytic herbs. ===Epiphytes=== Epiphytes were originally included in the phanerophytes (see above) but then separated because they do not grow in soil, so the soil location is irrelevant in classifying them. ===Chamaephytes=== These plants have buds on persistent shoots near the soil surface; woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the soil surface, a maximum of 25 cm above the soil surface, e.g., bilberry and periwinkle. ===Hemicryptophytes=== Hemicryptophytes These plants have buds at or near the soil surface, e.g. common daisy and dandelion, and are divided into: *Protohemicryptophytes: only cauline foliage; *Partial rosette plants: both cauline and basal rosette foliage; and *Rosette plants: only basal rosette foliage. ===Cryptophytes=== A cryptophyte geophyte These plants have subterranean or under water resting buds, and are divided into: *Geophytes: rest in dry soil as a rhizome, bulb, corm, et cetera, e.g. crocus and tulip, and are subdivided into: **Rhizome geophytes, **Stem-tuber geophytes, **Root- tuber geophytes, **Bulb geophytes, and **Root geophytes. *Helophytes: rest in marshy or wet soil, e.g. reedmace and marsh-marigold; and *Hydrophytes: rest submerged under water, e.g. water lily and frogbit. ===Therophytes=== These are annual plants that complete their lives rapidly in favorable conditions and survive the unfavorable cold or dry season in the form of seeds. Many desert plants are by necessity therophytes. ===Aerophytes=== Tillandsia landbeckii, an aerophyte Aerophytes were a later addition to the system.Gal\u00e1n de Mera, A., M. A. Hagen and J. A. Vicente Orellana (1999) Aerophyte, a New Life Form in Raunki\u00e6r's Classification? Journal of Vegetation Science 10 (1): 65-68 These are plants that obtain moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. They usually grow on other plants yet are not parasitic on them. These are perennial plants whose roots atrophy. Some can live on mobile sand dunes. Like epiphytes and hemicryptophytes, their buds are near the soil surface. Some Tillandsia species are classified as aerophytes. ===Popular References=== Farley Mowat, in his book, Never Cry Wolf, described using a Raunki\u00e6r's Circle in making a \u201ccover degree\u201d study to determine the ratios of various plants one to the other. He spoke of it as \"a device designed in hell.\" ==References== Category:Plant life-form Category:Botanical nomenclature Category:Ecology de:Lebensform (Botanik) ",
