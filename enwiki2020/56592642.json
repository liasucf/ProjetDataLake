Nauk. Societas Vistulana, 2003, p 91. Arnold, from 1196 (the date of his predecessor, Bishop Mrokota's, death) was a Pozna\u0144 bishop. However, he was mentioned for the first time only in the bull of Pope Innocent III of August 2, 1201. From 1206 Arnold II was a follower of Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw Laskonogi in his dispute with the Archbishop of Gniezno, Henryk Kietlicz, who led a hostile reform of a part of the clergy. Ignoring the interdict that the archbishop imposed on his diocese, he continued to give religious services to the cursed prince. It ended with an excommunication on Arnold, approved by a papal bull on January 10, 1207. He took part in the congress of princes in G\u0142og\u00f3w at Christmas 1208, where he removed church punishments. He took part in 1210 at the congress in Borzykowa. He died on January 15, 1211.According to some researchers, it is identical to the bishop of Lubus, documented in 1191, and it was only from this episcopate that he was transferred to Pozna\u0144. However, this hypothesis is impossible to prove and seems rather unlikely. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:1211 deaths Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:13th-century Polish people ",
