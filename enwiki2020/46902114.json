His album H\u00f4tel de Ville came out in 2017 on Warner Music Canada. == Early life == Born and raised in Toronto, Helman graduated in 2013 from Earl Haig Secondary School. He is Jewish. He got his guitar for his 10th birthday and by the time he was 14, he knew he wanted to be a professional musician. At 15 years old, he signed a development deal with Warner Music Canada where he began writing sessions with writers such as Simon Wilcox and Thomas \"Tawgs\" Salter. ==Career== In 2014, Scott Helman announced the release of the track \"Bungalow\" as the first single from his debut EP Augusta. He later toured with Tegan and Sara, Shawn Mendes, Walk Off the Earth and Vance Joy. Since the May 2017 release of his full-length album H\u00f4tel De Ville, Helman has toured and released the singles \u201cKinda Complicated,\u201d \u201cRipple Effect\u201d and the gold-certified \"PDA\". In February 2018, as part of CBC Music's Junos 365 Sessions, Scott Helman performed The Tragically Hip's iconic song, \"Bobcaygeon\" as a tribute to the late Gord Downie. In the summer of 2018, Scott was invited to open for Vance Joy's five Canadian tour dates, and then his European tour. In advance of the European tour, Scott released \"Hang Ups\", which was followed by a remix featuring Spanish singer Blas Cant\u00f3. In 2019, Scott toured the United States, opening for Dean Lewis. The song \"Everything Sucks\" was written during a difficult time when Helman was trying to find a song that could help lift his spirits, while simultaneously justifying the experience he was going through; when he could not find one, he wrote one himself. Helman's 2019 single \"Evergreen\" is about climate change; Helman called upon his fans to share their own thoughts on the issue under a movement he titled The EverGreen Manuscript, which was incorporated into the official video, a mural he painted in Toronto, and in a document, he plans to share with government officials. == Tours == * U.S Tour - Supporting Walk Off The Earth - 2015 * European Tour - Supporting Walk Off The Earth - 2015 * Canadian Tour - Supporting Matthew Good - 2015 * Canadian Tour - Scott Vs.
