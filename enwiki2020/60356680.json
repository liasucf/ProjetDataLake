    "text": "John K\u0151szegi (; died after 1327) was a Hungarian influential lord in the early 14th century, who served as Master of the horse from 1311 until 1314. He inherited large-scale domains in Slavonia and Transdanubia in 1310. After 1314 or 1315, he became an ardent enemy of Charles I of Hungary, who defeated him in 1316 and 1317, resulting the collapse of his province within months. He was the ancestor of the Tam\u00e1si family. ==Family== John was born into the powerful K\u0151szegi family around 1280 as the son of Henry II K\u0151szegi and his unidentified wife, the daughter of Palatine Mojs II. He had two siblings, Peter the \"Duke\", the ancestor of the Herceg de Szekcs\u0151 family, and a sister, who married into the Venetian patriarch Morosini family.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus H\u00e9der 4. K\u0151szegi [and Rohonci] branch) His three sons \u2013 Nicholas, Peter and Henry \u2013 bore the Tam\u00e1si surname since 1339, when they first appeared in contemporary records. The Tam\u00e1si family descended from Henry and provided influential barons during the reign of King Sigismund; the kinship became extinct in 1444.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus H\u00e9der 5. Tam\u00e1si branch) ==Powerful lord== After the death of his father in the spring of 1310, John inherited his large-scale and contiguous domains in Upper Slavonia \u2013 e.g. Krapina (Korpona), Belec, Kostel, Vrbovec (Orbolc), O\u0161trc (Oszterc), \u0110ur\u0111evac, Koprivnica (Kapronca) \u2013 and Southern Transdanubia \u2013 e.g. Somogyv\u00e1r, D\u00f6br\u00f6k\u00f6z, Domb\u00f3v\u00e1r and K\u0151szeg (Batina) \u2013, becoming one of the most powerful lords in the Kingdom of Hungary, who administered his province independently of the monarch. John inherited Henry's political positions too; he functioned as isp\u00e1n of Bodrog, Somogy and Tolna counties from 1310 until his defeat in 1316. Initially, John continued his father's latest policy and nominally supported the efforts of Charles I, who became the incontestable King of Hungary after years of civil war fought for the throne. He was made Master of the horse in late 1311 and held the dignity until the second half of 1314. On 23 January 1312, Nicholas III K\u0151szegi confirmed his previously concluded alliance with the House of Habsburg in F\u00fcrstenfeld (), beyond his own person, on behalf of his brother Andrew, his uncle Bishop Nicholas of Gy\u0151r and the sons of the late Henry, John and Peter \"the Duke\". The ruins of Essegv\u00e1r, seized by John K\u0151szegi Despite his court position, John administered his province without the king's intervention. In the following years, there are several reports of his committed crimes and dominations against his neighbors, when aimed to further spread his influence over the remaining portions of Slavonia and the eastern counties of Southern Transdanubia. For instance, he seized the forts of K\u00e9m\u00e9nd from James Gy\u0151r around 1313 and Hars\u00e1ny from the Matucsinai family in Baranya County. There, he also owned Orahovica (Raholca), a possible heritage from his father. After his successful expansions, he was also styled as isp\u00e1n of the county since 1315. In addition, John also owned the castles of Ny\u00e9k, Tam\u00e1si and Tolnav\u00e1r in Tolna County at least since 1315. John also had interests in the southeastern part of Veszpr\u00e9m County, after he besieged and acquired Essegv\u00e1r (today ruins near B\u00e1nd) from L\u0151rinte II L\u0151rinte around 1314. Simultaneously, he also made plundering raids and invasions from his territory of Upper Slavonia. He acquired the fort of Ludbreg from the P\u00e9c kindred in Bjelovar-Kri\u017eevci County and B\u00e9la Castle from the Priory of Vrana (Order of Saint John) and Lobor in Vara\u017edin County. Around 1314, John also besieged and occupied Als\u00f3lendva in southern Zala County (today Lendava, Slovenia) from Stephen Hah\u00f3t or his son Nicholas (formerly historians J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi and Erik F\u00fcgedi incorrectly identified Ivan K\u0151szegi as belligerent and set 1292 for the date of the siege). Egyed Monoszl\u00f3 made his last will and testament in March 1313, not long before his death; according to his intention, his widow and minor orphan daughters were supposed to inherit the whole Atyina lordship (today Vo\u0107in in Croatia). However, as Charles I narrated in his document issued on 22 May 1317, John K\u0151szegi demanded Atyina for his family in accordance with the right of escheatage. Nevertheless, Egyed's son-in-law Nicholas Aba and his brothers acquired Atyina Castle. John K\u0151szegi captured and imprisoned Nicholas and Peter Aba (or Atyinai) shortly thereafter. In the first half of 1314, Nicholas was taken tied up before the Atyina Castle and dragged along the walls at the heels of a horse to persuade the defenders to surrender the fort. Despite this, John K\u0151szegi was unable to capture Atyina and took Nicholas back to prison, who languished in captivity in the subsequent three years. Sometimes before 1316, John also occupied the fort of Koro\u0111 (K\u00f3r\u00f3gy) in Valk\u00f3 County from its owners, the K\u00f3r\u00f3gyi family. ==Downfall== According to historian P\u00e1l Engel, John K\u0151szegi's behavior regarding the heirdom of Atyina, among others, contributed to the open confrontation between Charles I and the oligarchic powers, which reached its peak at the general diet in the autumn of 1314. In Engel's hypothesis, Charles launched a military campaign against the K\u0151szegis beyond the river Drava in the summer. There were some clashes, where numerous familiares of John K\u0151szegi were captured. Accordingly, Charles summoned the diet thereafter and broke the alliance with the provincial lords and intended to defeat them one after another. In contrast, historian Gyula Krist\u00f3 questioned Engel's analysis: there is no information that the diet has been held in 1314, which proved to be a peaceful year without serious military campaigns. Krist\u00f3 said there are no proofs that a confrontation between John and the royal armies took place in that year, and it was only a local war against the Atyinai (or Ny\u00e9ki) family. M\u00e1r\u00e9 Castle, owned by John K\u0151szegi until 1316 In the autumn of 1315, Charles I launched his first large-scale campaign against John and Peter K\u0151szegi and their territory. Charles personally led his troops into Tolna County. He besieged and captured the fort of Ny\u00e9k in November. However John sought assistance from his relatives, Andrew, who administered Western Transdanubia and Nicholas II; they represented the other two branches of the K\u0151szegi family. According to P\u00e1l Engel, the united K\u0151szegi troops managed to expel the royal army from the region, while successfully recovered the castle of Ny\u00e9k. Gyula Krist\u00f3 doubted Charles' personal presence and considered the royal troops failed to take Ny\u00e9k. After a few months of ceasefire, Charles launched his second campaign against the K\u0151szegis' province in Southern Transdanubia in the spring of 1316. John's relatives, were unable to provide help, including Andrew, because his several familiares pledged allegiance to the king and left his army in the same time. The royal army stormed into John's territory across the port of B\u00e1ta along the Danube in May, in order to eliminate the K\u0151szegis' hinterland. They besieged and destroyed Somogyv\u00e1r in Somogy County, then captured the forts of Tolnav\u00e1r, Ny\u00e9k and Tam\u00e1si in Tolna County within weeks in June. Subsequently, Charles' army occupied Hars\u00e1ny and K\u00e9m\u00e9nd in Baranya County before their ultimate successful siege at K\u0151szeg (Batina) in July. John's other castles in Transdanubia \u2013 for instance, Domb\u00f3v\u00e1r, Szekcs\u0151, D\u00f6br\u00f6k\u00f6z and M\u00e1r\u00e9 \u2013 surrendered without combat. P\u00e1l Engel argued several familiares of John K\u0151szegi, including Nicholas Fels\u0151lendvai, Alexander Ozorai and Stephen M\u00e1r\u00e9i, had departed from his allegiance before the war due to Charles' successful persuasion and bribery, which resulted the monarch's decisive victory. In the upcoming months, Charles handed over a significant part of the occupied lands and castles to their original rightful owners. The king returned to Temesv\u00e1r (present-day Timi\u0219oara, Romania) by August. After the loss of Southern Transdanubia, John and Peter K\u0151szegi withdrew to Upper Slavonia beyond the Drava. Krist\u00f3 argued the aforementioned minor clashes there occurred in the second half of 1316 (and not in 1314, as Engel proposed), when Mikcs \u00c1kos captured seventeen servants of the K\u0151szegis, who tried to destroy the village of Kri\u017eevci. John and Peter K\u0151szegi entered alliance with the sons of the late Stephen Baboni\u0107, who ruled Lower Slavonia, at the end of 1316. Their anti- Charles league, which directed against the newly appointed Ban John Baboni\u0107, was also supported by a local powerful lord, Peter Monoszl\u00f3. Charles I, who managed three other campaigns against the oligarchs \u2013 including Andrew K\u0151szegi \u2013 at the same time, sent his army, led by Demetrius Nekcsei, Paul Garai and Stephen M\u00e1r\u00e9i, against the insurgents in June 1317. John Baboni\u0107 launched a counterattack too; he defeated the K\u0151szegis in two battles and also captured several castles, including Orahovica, Monoszl\u00f3 (today Podravska Moslavina, Croatia), Polosnica, Me\u0111ura\u010da (Megyericse) and Zdenci (Izdenc) by the end of the year. Withdrawing to the northwestern portions of Slavonia, John K\u0151szegi was able to retain his lands and forts only in Vara\u017edin County and Zagorje, where from his father, Henry II extended his power over the decades. There were some border conflicts in the following years, and John retook Me\u0111ura\u010da; Charles' general Paul Sz\u00e9csi was killed, when attempted to recapture the fort in late 1318. John and Peter fought in the army of their relative Andrew, whose province was ultimately crushed by the royal troops in the first half of 1319. Nicholas Ludbregi recaptured B\u00e9la Castle for the Priory of Vrana by the end of the year, and finally retook his seat Ludbreg from the K\u0151szegi brothers in early 1320. John surrendered by the spring of 1320, only some castles remained in his possession, including Krapina and Koprivnica. On 18 March 1322, Charles I referred to John and Peter as \"former rebels, now Our adherents\". When his namesake cousin, John the \"Wolf\" rose up in open rebellion against Charles I in 1327, John and Peter joined to him. However royal generals Mikcs \u00c1kos and Alexander K\u00f6cski defeated them within months. During the military campaign, John K\u0151szegi lost his fortress of Koprivnica, which was captured by Mikcs \u00c1kos. John died sometime after 1327, but presumably before 1336; when the K\u0151szegis made an alliance with the Habsburgs in that year, only Peter's name was listed among the traitors by Charles I. His three sons pledged allegiance to the king in May 1339; in exchange for Vrbovec, they were granted (back) Tam\u00e1si, following that they were referred to with the surname \"Tam\u00e1si\". == References == == Sources == * * * * |- |- John Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people ",
