Tweedbank has a pond known as Gunknowe Loch, a restaurant Herges on The Loch, several shops, and a railway station. ==History== The settlement was started in the early 1970s on the land of a farm whose original house still stands (serving as a boarding cattery) adjacent to the community centre (known locally as 'The Barns'). The original settlement was built by Scottish Special Housing and included the streets of Neidpath Court, Blakehope Court, Hareshaw Bank, Stobshaw Place, Stobshaw Terrace and Haining Drive. In the 1980s Bett Housing (later to be taken over by Lema Homes) began building on the site at the entry of Tweedbank from Galashiels; this estate included the streets Abbotslea, Riverside Drive, Abbotsferry Road, Lowood Park, Ladymoss and Heathery Rigg. To locals this area was often known as 'the Betts'. The 1990s saw two developments by Eildon Housing Association, namely Jura Drive and Craw Wood, with private housing being built around Tweedbank View and Tweedbank Drive. The final development in the 2000s was constructed by Barratt Homes in the area around Weavers Linn, built on the former Abbotsford to Lowood road (later a footpath). Before the advent of the new town of Tweedbank, the area was occupied by the farms of Tweedbank and Bridgend Mains .Ordnance Survey map 6 in. to 1 mile: Selkirkshire Sheet VIII.NW & NE, Surveyed: 1897, Published: 1900 The new housing estate lies in the civil parish of Melrose in the former county of Roxburghshire.Canmore website entry for Tweedbank: canmore.org.uk/site/86457 - website of the archeological inventory of Historic Environment Scotland ==Education, sport and landmarks== The original primary school near the loch was a small school of fewer than 100 pupils and composite classes. In 1996 this changed, due to a slightly increasing population, and the school was now able to teach students in separate classrooms organised by their year of schooling. In the early 2000s the school expanded due to a significant increase in the local population. In addition to residential housing and the Primary School, Tweedbank also boasts an all weather sports complex, an Astroturf football and hockey pitch, an indoor bowling club, a large children's all-weather play area, and the Gun Knowe Loch, which is actually a man-made lake. The loch is popular with locals due to its abundance of swans and ducks. Amenities located next to the Gun Knowe Loch include a local shop, a hairdressers, and the bar/restaurant Herg\u00e9s on the Loch, which has outdoor seating available in the summer. Government offices for Agriculture & Fisheries and the Scottish Public Pensions Agency can also be found within Tweedbank. Tweedbank is the site of the biggest industrial estate in the region and of Radio Borders HQ. ==Culture== Each year in May, the village celebrates a week-long 'Tweedbank Fair' in which a local 'Tweedbank Lad and Lass' (together with two attendants each) are appointed from members of the school's Primary Seven class. ==Transport== Class 158 DMU at Tweedbank railway station The village is served by Tweedbank railway station, the terminus of the Borders Railway that runs between the Central Borders and Edinburgh.
