    "text": "Laurent Brochard (born 26 March 1968 in Le Mans, France) is a retired professional road racing cyclist from France. In 1997 he won a stage of the Tour de France and became world road champion in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain. Brochard was a runner and started cycling competitively at 19. He started with Castorama and became part of Festina cycling team. His role in Festina was super-domestique, supporting stars such as Richard Virenque but able to ride competitively when given the chance. He was implicated in the Festina scandal in the 1998 Tour de France. After serving his suspension, Brochard joined Ag2r Pr\u00e9voyance as leader and had successes in races such as Crit\u00e9rium International and Etoile de B\u00e9ss\u00e8ges. He then moved to Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com. He is a fan of Belgian comic character Marsupilami, often wearing Marsupilami logo and clothing at races. ==Major results== ;1991 - amateur : 2 stage wins - Circuit Franco-Belge ;1992 - Castorama : Stage win - Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en ;1993 - Castorama : Stage win - Tour M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en ;1994 - Castorama : Overall - Tour du Haut-Var : Overall and 1 stage win - Regio-Tour ;1995 - Festina : 3 stage wins - Tour de l'Ain ;1996 - Festina : Overall and 2 stage wins - Tour du Limousin ;1997 - Festina : World Road Race Cycling Champion : Stage 9 - Tour de France : 3 stage wins - GP Midi Libre ;1998 - Festina : 1 stage win - GP Midi Libre ;1999 - Festina : Stage win - Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;2000 - Jean Delatour : Paris\u2013Bourges : Route Adeli\u00e9 : Stage win - Paris\u2013Nice : Stage win - Crit\u00e9rium International ;2001 - Jean Delatour : Paris\u2013Camembert : Grand Prix de Villers-Cotter\u00eats : Stage win - Circuit de la Sarthe : Coupe de France de cyclisme sur route ;2002 - : Overall and 1 stage win - Tour de Pologne : Overall and 1 stage win - Regio-Tour : Stage win - GP Midi Libre ;2003 - : Paris\u2013Camembert : Overall and 1 stage win - Crit\u00e9rium International : Stage win - Troph\u00e9e Castille et Leon ;2004 - : Overall and 1 stage win - \u00c9toile de Bess\u00e8ges : Stage win - Circuit de la Sarthe ;2005 - : Paris\u2013Camembert : 5th overall - Tirreno\u2013Adriatico ;2006 - : no wins ;2007 - : Mountains classification - Tour de Romandie : Points classification - Tour Down Under : Stage win - Tour de Luxembourg ;2008 - Amateur : 5th Place L'Etape du Tour 2008 ==See also== * List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences ==External links== *Profile at Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com official website * Cyclingnews interview 2003 * Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:French male cyclists Category:French Tour de France stage winners Category:French Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners Category:French sportspeople in doping cases Category:Olympic cyclists of France Category:UCI Road World Champions (elite men) Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Le Mans Category:Tour de France cyclists ",
