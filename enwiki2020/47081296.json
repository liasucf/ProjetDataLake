    "text": "Ren\u00e9 Gabriel (14 September 1890 \u2013 30 October 1950) was a French decorative artist and designer who specialized in furniture series (meuble de s\u00e9rie). He had a clean, logical style that inspired many of the new designers in the years after World War II (1939\u201345). The prestigious Prix Ren\u00e9 Gabriel continues to be awarded to French designers for modern designs that can be mass-produced. ==Early career== Ren\u00e9 Gabriel was born on 14 September 1899 in Maisons-Alfort, Paris. He studied at the \u00c9cole Germain Pilon from 1912 to 1914, and at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts d\u00e9coratifs (ENSAD) from 1914 to 1917. From 1919 he exhibited furniture and painted designs at the Salon des Artistes D\u00e9corateurs and the Salon d'Automne. Gabriel's sober and rational furniture style resembled that of Francis Jourdain. At the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris he designed the Chambre de Jeune Fille at the Ambassade Fran\u00e7aise. Gabriel also made block-printed wallpaper at his Au Sansonnet workshop in the 1920s. Later he made wallpaper patterns for Nobilis and Papiers Peints de France. His designs covered a wide range, and included elegant florals or landscapes and jazzy abstractions. In 1924 Gabriel became a professor at the \u00c9cole des Arts Appliqu\u00e9s. He contributed to the Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres from 1927. ==Last years== Furniture for an apartment in Le Havre After World War II (1939\u201345) Gabriel had considerable influence through the courses that he gave at ENSAD, and also for his work on the reconstruction of Le Havre, where he was commissioned to design furniture by the architect Auguste Perret. From 1944 to 1947 he was president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des artistes d\u00e9corateurs. He was head of the workshop at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs from 1946. In 1949 he was named a knight of the Legion of Honour. Ren\u00e9 Gabriel died on 30 October 1950. ==Legacy== Gabriel's aesthetic combined elegance with uncompromising rigor. He inspired the new generation of designers of the 1950s. Paul Breton, director of the Salon des arts m\u00e9nagers, created a prize in Gabriel's honor in 1951 to boost mass production of high-quality modern furniture. The Prix Ren\u00e9 Gabriel is the most prestigious French design award. It rewards a designer for innovative and democratic furniture. Winners have included Marcel Gascoin, Henri Meyer, Ren\u00e9-Jean Caillette, Jacques Hauville, the brothers Robert and Jacques Perreau, Roger Landault, Alain Richard, Pierre Gautier Delaye, Pierre Guariche, Marc Berthier, Pierre Paulin, Antoine Philippon and Jacqueline Lecoq, and Pascal Mourgue. ==Exhibitions== Gabriel's work was shown in exhibitions that included: *1921: Exposition of French Art in the Rhine *1925: International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris *1926: Mus\u00e9e Galliera *1930: Antwerp Exposition internationale coloniale, maritime et d'art flamand (carpet) *1933, Exposition of the Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres at the Hague (porcelains) *1934: Galeries Bernheim et Charpentier, porcelains *1934: Salon de la Lumi\u00e8re, furniture sets *1935: Salon des arts m\u00e9nagers, furniture series *1936: Milan Triennale *1937: Salon des arts m\u00e9nagers (Children's village, Decorative artists pavilion, School of applied arts *1938: Salon des arts m\u00e9nagers *1938: Cairo *1939: New York, Pavillon de la France (furniture sets).
