She is the leader of the National Confederation of Women. M\u00e1xima Apaza founded the Federation of Women of El Alto.MESA 2: CON MUJERES TENDR\u00c1S QUE PELEAR She was elected senator, as substitute for Senator Jos\u00e9 Alberto Gonzales for the MAS (Movement to Socialism). In July 2015 she participated in the \"Foro Nueva Independencia\", held in the Argentine city of Tucum\u00e1n (Argentina):Foro Nueva Independencia In the panel \"With women you will have to fight: gender, politics and social movements. Traditions of struggle, political and social memory. New challenges for women\" shared with the panelists Hebe de Bonafini (president of the association Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo), with Milagro Sala (activist from Jujuy, leader of the association La Tupac Amaru), and with Piedad C\u00f3rdoba, moderated by the writer and activist Marta Dillon. M\u00e1xima Apaza highlighted the decolonizing character and the gender perspective in the policies implemented by the Government led by Evo Morales. But, simultaneously, she recognized the need for a collective work and from the bases to end against the patriarchy: \"If in a home we put into practice decolonization, assuming men and women the roles and functions of the home, is a contribution in this historical juncture we are living\". Apaza is an advocate for safe abortions. She has worked with Ipas for years to educate people on the preventable public health problem of unsafe abortion, which tends to greatly affect rural, indigenous women. Prior to her work in Bolivia, abortions were only accessible in cases of rape. Furthermore, women were dying as a result of unsafe abortions. Though restrictions on these abortions still exist, Apaza has contributed to women being able to have access to safe and effective abortions. Pregnant women with serious health conditions, financial limitations, and who are minors or adolescents are now among those who are able to access safe abortions. Apaza's stance on the reform of the penal code regarding abortions is as follows: \"We cannot turn a blind eye to this reality. With the reform of the penal code, for the first time women will be able to decide over their own bodies and that decision must be respected.\" Has collected international accessions for the exit to the sea of Bolivia: Suddenly the brothers from different countries manifest themselves: \u00abMar for Bolivia!\u00bb. And where are the Bolivians, in the country that we visit so much the president [Evo Morales] there is a spontaneous reaction and they all say: \"Mar for Bolivia!\". The world is aware that Bolivia lives in an enclosure that harms it, we do not have access to the sea and that hurts our economy, harms the economy of the region. The countries realize perfectly and that is why we receive countless supports from different countries. Where the president arrives, where a Bolivian arrives, there will always be a support that says \"sea for Bolivia.\" So we do not reach all countries, we know that they are supporting us. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from La Paz Category:Bolivian Christian socialists Category:Bolivian people of Aymara descent Category:Democratic socialists Category:Indigenous leaders of the Americas Category:Movement for Socialism (Bolivia) politicians Category:20th-century women politicians Category:21st- century women politicians Category:Women members of the Senate of Bolivia Category:Members of the Senate of Bolivia Category:Indigenous people of South America Category:Women human rights defenders Category:Female Christian socialists ",
