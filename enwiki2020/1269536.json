    "text": "Muckross Abbey The abbey in the 1890s Muckross Abbey (Irish: Mainistir Locha L\u00e9in and Mainistir Mhucrois) is one of the major ecclesiastical sites found in the Killarney National Park, County Kerry, Ireland. It was founded in 1448 as a Franciscan friary for the Observantine Franciscans by Donal McCarthy Mor. It has had a violent history and has been damaged and reconstructed many times. The friars were often subjected to raids by marauding groups and were persecuted by Cromwellian forces under Lord Ludlow. Today the abbey is largely roofless although, apart from this, is generally quite well preserved. Its most striking feature is a central courtyard, which contains a large yew tree and is surrounded by a vaulted cloister.Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Volume 2. 1892.
