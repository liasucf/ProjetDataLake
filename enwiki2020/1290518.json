    "text": "Gleneagles Hotel is a hotel near Auchterarder, Scotland. ==History== Construction of hotel was commenced by the Caledonian Railway (CR), which also built the nearby Gleneagles railway station. However by the time it opened in 1924, the CR had been absorbed by the London, Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS). It was equipped with its own dedicated railway branch line. An up-and- coming dance band leader named Henry Hall was involved in buying their pianos, and organising the dance band entertainment. He decided that radio broadcasts would be an ideal way to advertise the new hotel, so was given permission to move his Trafford Band from Manchester's Midland Hotel to the Gleneagles and form a new band in Manchester. The hotel's opening night was celebrated with Scotland's first ever outside broadcast on 7 June 1924. After the season ended, the band moved to the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. Summer 1925 saw the band return to Gleneagles, although their commercial recordings were made in Manchester, and the winter seasons were in Liverpool. During World War II, as with many large country hotels, it was converted into Gleneagles Hospital under the charge of Dr Thomas Ferguson as Medical Superintendent. In 1948 ownership of the hotel passed from LMS to the British Transport Commission and in 1963 to British Transport Hotels.British Rail Hotels Limited Railway Gazette 28 September 1962 page 353 In 1980 the hotel was designated as a Category B listed building. In 1981, British Transport Hotels sold Gleneagles to a newly-established private sector operator, Gleneagles Hotels plc.Gleneagles sale Rails August 1981 page 19 In 1984 it was acquired by Arthur Bell & Sons, which came into the ownership of Guinness in 1985 and Diageo in 1997. Between 1982 and 1986, \u00a311 million was spent on renovation and since 1982 the hotel has been open all year round. In 1986, and every year since, the hotel has been awarded five red stars by the AA. The hotel remained owned by Diageo, until it was sold to a private investment company Ennismore in 2015. The hotel was redeveloped in preparation for hosting the 40th Ryder Cup in 2014 played on the PGA Centenary Course. ==Facilities== Gleneagles has three golf courses: the King's Course, Queen's Course and PGA Centenary Course, previously known as the Monarch's Course.
