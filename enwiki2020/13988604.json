The rivalry was considered by many as the best in Mississippi, featuring a prank by Mississippi College students who painted \"TO HELL WITH MILSAPS\" (sic) on the Millsaps Observatory. The football rivalry resumed in 2000 as the \"Backyard Brawl\", with games being held at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium until 2006 when it was played at Robinson-Hale Stadium on the campus of Mississippi College.
