    "text": "Menendo Gonz\u00e1lez (Portuguese and Galician: Mendo Gon\u00e7alves; died 6 October 1008) was a semi-autonomous Duke of Galicia and Count of Portugal (997\u20131008), a dominant figure in the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. He was the royal alf\u00e9rez, the king's armour-bearer (armiger regis) and commander of the royal armies, under Vermudo II (r. 984\u2013999), and he continued to hold the position until his death. He became the tutor (1003) and ultimately father-in-law of Vermudo's successor, King Alfonso V. He maintained peaceful diplomatic relations with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba until 1004, after which there was a state of war. ==Regency of Alfonso V== Before 999, King Vermudo II placed his heir, Alfonso V, under the tutorship of his alf\u00e9rez Menendo. Alfonso was only five at his father's death (September 999) and he spent the early years of his reign in the care of Menendo and his wife. The earliest act of Alfonso as king dates to 13 October 999, and it lists as confirmants first Count Menendo Gonz\u00e1lez (\"Menendus Gundisaluiz, comes\") and then \"Duke\" Sancho Garc\u00eda of Castile (\"Santius, dux, Garsea prolis\"). Menendo, too, appears in contemporary documents with the ducal title, as in \"Lord Duke Menendo, son of Gonzalo\" (\"dux domnus Menendus proles Gundisalvi\"). Alfonso V in the twelfth-century Libro de los Testamentos (fol. 53v). Until 1003, the young Alfonso always appears in his official acts with his mother, Elvira Garc\u00eda, a sister of the count of Castile, beside him. Possibly she was exercising the regency under her brother's influence. In 1000, Menendo witnessed the king's confirmation of the testament of Hilal, called Salvatus, the Mozarabic abbot of San Cipriano de Valdesalce, after the queen-regent Elvira and before five bishops of the realm. A charter dated 23 December 1001 records the settlement of a dispute concerning the monastery of Celanova by Alfonso V and \"his elder, the lord Menendo, son of Gonzalo\" (\"senatus sui domni Ermenagildi Gundisaluiz prolis\"). Another charter dated 11 January 1002 records the donation of San Andr\u00e9s de Congostro to the monastery of Celanova and was confirmed by Duke Menendo. After 1003, Elvira no longer appears in royal charters; she may have been removed in a palace coup by Menendo. In subscribing one royal act Menendo went so far as to call himself \"he who under the authority of the aforementioned king ordains and guides all things\" (\"qui sub imperio iam dicti regis hec omnia ordinavit et docuit\"). In 1004, Sancho challenged the regency of Menendo. Both counts petitioned the C\u00f3rdoban hajib Abd al-Malik to arbitrate the dispute. According to Ibn Khaldun, a hearing took place and Abd al-Malik's deputy, the judge (qadi) of the Mozarabic community of C\u00f3rdoba, Asbag bin Abd Allah bin Nabil, found in favour of Menendo. According to some sources this took place in C\u00f3rdoba with the two disputant counts in attendance, but according to others it took place in Le\u00f3n. A royal charter of 1007 gives the king's recognition to the power of Menendo in Galicia. In it he is called \"the great count who holds all the land of Galicia\" (comes magnus ... omnem terram Gallecie ... obtinebat). ==Relations with C\u00f3rdoba== Menendo did not initially collaborate with C\u00f3rdoba, but after contingents were sent from C\u00f3rdoba to reinforce Coimbra and the frontier with Portugal, Menendo entered into a pact with Abd al-Malik. This included a clause calling for military collaboration in 1003. That year Leonese and Castilian troops assisted C\u00f3rdoba in an attack on Catalonia. This pact seems to have been broken in 1005, when a C\u00f3rdoban army marched on the Leonese kingdom with the intent of taking Zamora. The city was not captured, but a large territory was seized. For the remainder of Menendo's regency there was no peace with C\u00f3rdoba. A pyxis once owned by Menendo Gonz\u00e1lez and now in the museum of the cathedral of Braga provides further evidence of his relations with C\u00f3rdoba. The ivory pyxis with chalice and silver paten,C\u00e1lice de S. Geraldo at the Museum of the Cathedral of Braga. has an inscription on the rim of its lid which allows it to be dated to between 1004, when the hajib Abd al-Malik received the title he bears in the inscription, Sayf al-Dawla (\"sword of the state\"), and 1007, when he received the higher title of al- Muzaffar (\"the victorious\"). The pyxis was acquired by Menendo before his death, since an inscription to the bottom relates its donation to the church by him and his wife, Toda. The chalice and paten, which are contemporary, appear to be made to fit the pyxis and were possibly commissioned by Menendo. How he obtained the pyxis is unknown. He may have taken it as booty during a campaign against C\u00f3rdoba, or received it as a gift from the court of C\u00f3rdoba to the Leonese regent during diplomatic negotiations. The historian Seraf\u00edn Moralejo suggests it may have been presented to Menendo by Asbagh the qadi as \"a good-will gift ... a bitter one indeed and a warning, too, since the title of Sayf al-Dawla carved on its lid commemorated the raid the hajib had launched on Le\u00f3n one year earlier.\" The iconography of the pyxis might indicate its function as a diplomatic gift. ==Violent death== The last recorded act of Menendo was to confirm a charter of the monastery of San Pedro de Rocas in 1007. He was mentioned in a lawsuit settled in favour of Count Munio Fern\u00e1ndez in early 1008, but as he did not confirm the result it is probable that he was away from court in Galicia. Eight months later, on 6 October 1008, he died a violent death in unclear circumstances. Ibn Khaldun, dating his death by the anno Hegirae, places it between 17 September 1007 and 4 September 1008, but the date provided by the Chronicon Lusitanum is more reliable. It records that \"in the year 1046 of the Spanish era, on the day preceding the nones of October, Count Menendo was killed.\" The wording of both Ibn Khaldun and the Chronicon suggests that Menendo died violently, probably assassinated. Count Munio has been suspected of arranging his assassination in order to usurp the regency. If so, he was foiled by the queen-mother, Elvira Garc\u00eda, who proclaimed the fourteen-year-old Alfonso to be of age to assume the responsibilities of government. Around 1013, Alfonso married Elvira Men\u00e9ndez, Gonzalo's daughter. She gave birth to a son, Vermudo III, who succeeded him on the throne, and a daughter, Sancha, who married Count Ferdinand of Castile and passed the Leonese throne on to him. Elvira Men\u00e9ndez died on 2 December 1022. In 1014 Alfonso V confirmed all the possessions of the monastery of Guimar\u00e3es, which had been founded by Menendo's grandmother, Mumadona D\u00edaz. ==Viking attack?== Olaf Haraldsson. It has been suggested that Menendo was perhaps killed defending Portugal from a Viking raid. According to the later Icelandic saga Heimskringla, the Vikings under Olaf Haraldsson attacked Gunnvaldsborg, possibly to be identified as a descriptive toponym meaning \"city of Gonz\u00e1lez\" (in Latin *Gundisalvus-burgus) and indicating Tui, which was within Menendo's dukedom and is independently known to have been destroyed by Vikings about this time. There is a Latin document of 1024 that bears the rubric Tudensis sedes post Normannorum vastationem Ecclesiae Divi Jacobi attributa: \"the see of Tui was assigned to the church of Santiago after being laid waste by the Northmen\". In the words of the Heimskringla: > He [Olaf] conquered the castle called Gunnvaldsborg\u2014it was large and old\u2014and > there he captured the earl who was in command there, called Geirfith. Then > he had a meeting with the townspeople and imposed a ransom on them for > freeing the earl\u2014twelve thousand gold shillings; and that sum was paid by > the townspeople as he had demanded. As says Sigvat: > :A thirteenth time the Thronders' > :thane did win a battle > :south in Seljupollarin > :sithen, with great carnage, > :when to ancient stronghold > :early at morn he marched, and > :gallant Earl Geirfith of > :Gunnvaldsborg made captive. All the details of this theory\u2014Menendo's death in battle, the identity of Gunnvaldsborg and the timing and place of Olaf's raid\u2014are speculative and have been recently dismissed as unfounded. ==Family relations== Menendo Gonz\u00e1lez was probably the eldest son and successor of Gonzalo Men\u00e9ndez and his wife Ilduara Pel\u00e1ez. Menendo's wife is variously known in contemporary sources as Toda, Tota, Todadomna, Tutadomna, Tutadonna, etc. One twelfth-century source calls her Mayor. Menendo had at least six sons and three daughters: *Rodrigo Men\u00e9ndez, a direct ancestor in the maternal line of Urraca Fr\u00f3ilaz, wife of Pedro Fr\u00f3ilaz de Traba *Gonzalo Men\u00e9ndez (attested 983\u20131008), is cited with the title of count during his father's lifetime *Pelayo Men\u00e9ndez, served as armiger regis in 1012\u201314 *Ramiro Men\u00e9ndez (attested 1005\u201315), served as armiger regis in 1015 *Egas Men\u00e9ndez (attested 1007\u201314) *Munio Men\u00e9ndez (attested 1007\u201314) *Elvira Men\u00e9ndez, queen of Alfonso V *Ilduara Men\u00e9ndez (attested 1025\u201358), married Nu\u00f1o Al\u00f3itiz, a count in Portugal *Ildoncia (Eldonza) Men\u00e9ndez (attested 1014) == Notes == == References == == Bibliography== === Secondary sources === * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * === Primary sources === * * * * Category:1008 deaths Category:Counts of Portugal Category:County of Portugal Category:10th-century rulers of Portugal Category:11th-century rulers of Portugal Category:Year of birth unknown ",
