It is operated by AENA. ==History== Although it had been in operation since the beginning of the 1950s, the official opening of the airport took place on 19 January 1958. In 1961 began the first renovation of the airport complex, with an extension of the runway and enlargement of the passenger terminal. In 1975 Infraero became the administrator of the airport, which later invested in further extension of the runway (completed in 1993) and in great enlargement of the passenger terminal (completed in 1998). In 2012 the airport has already started the last extension through the construction of a completely new passenger terminal which will double its capacity. Previously operated by Infraero, on March 15, 2019 AENA won a 30-year concession to operate the airport. ==Airlines and destinations== ==Accidents and incidents== *12 July 1951: a L\u00f3ide A\u00e9reo Nacional Douglas DC-3/C-47 registration PP-LPG, still registered under Linhas A\u00e9reas Paulistas \u2013 LAP, flying from Macei\u00f3 to Aracaju, after aborting a landing in adverse conditions in Aracaju, overflew the runway and initiated a turn in low altitude to the right.
