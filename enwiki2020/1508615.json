    "text": "Brendan Kenneally (born 1 April 1955) is a former Irish Fianna F\u00e1il politician. He was a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Waterford constituency. He was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1989 general election. He retained the seat at subsequent elections until losing it at the 2002 general election. He then became a member of the 22nd Seanad, nominated by the Taoiseach. He regained his D\u00e1il seat at the 2007 general election. Kenneally's father Billy Kenneally also served as a TD for Waterford from 1965 to 1982, and his grandfather William Kenneally served as a TD for Waterford from 1952 to 1961. He was appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications by the Taoiseach Albert Reynolds in 1992. The Sunday Tribune reported that while a senator, between 2005 and 2007, Kenneally ran up total expenses amounting to \u20ac139,189. On 3 August 2009, the Irish Independent revealed that Kenneally was one of the TDs with the highest expense claims in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 2008. He claimed \u20ac73,857 in expenses. He lost his seat at the 2011 general election. In 2016, after his cousin was convicted of 1980s sexual abuse of boys, Brendan Kenneally revealed that he had been approached in 2002 by one victim's family but had not informed the Garda because the victim did not want him to. This caused controversy in 2020 for Mary Butler, his successor as Waterford Fianna F\u00e1il TD, who apologised for allowing him to canvass for her in the general election and for renting an office from him. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Local councillors in County Waterford Category:Mayors of Waterford Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 28th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 30th D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Politicians from County Waterford Category:Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann Category:Fianna F\u00e1il senators Category:Alumni of Waterford Institute of Technology ",
