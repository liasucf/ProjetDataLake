    "text": "A West Midlands Police motorcyclist escorts a British Army ambulance during the strike The 1989\u201390 British ambulance strike was part of a dispute over pay between ambulance crews and the government with action lasting from 7 September 1989 to 23 February 1990. Ambulance workers were aggrieved that their pay had fallen behind that of firefighters, with which it had been linked in 1985. A government pay offer of 7.5% was rejected by the five ambulance workers unions who demanded a 25.8% rise. Union action started with an overtime ban but escalated to a full refusal of crews to attend non- emergency calls in November. The government used the British Army, volunteer ambulances and the police to mitigate the effects of the strike. A pay deal of 16.9% was reached on 23 February 1990 and the ambulance crews returned to work. The strike was regarded as a success for the union, who had carefully cultivated public opinion throughout. == Background == A Kent Ambulance Service vehicle pictured in 1987 Ambulance provision in the United Kingdom was organised on a local basis by separate ambulance services. The pay and conditions of employees in these services had last been agreed by the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability in 1979. The commission recognised that morale was low and recommended a pay increase of 25.8% (at a time when annual inflation was around 16%). Despite this the ambulance workers had gone on strike in 1981\u20132 over pay, with emergency cover being provided by the police. As a result of the strike a new salary scale was agreed in November 1985, linking pay to that of firefighters. The fire brigades union (and police) secured favourable pay settlements which broke the link and, by 1989 ambulance workers were paid 11% less than firefighters. The ambulance workers, represented by five trade unions, considered they had been forgotten and that the service was being run \"on the cheap\". The unions sought to restore the link established in the 1985 settlement and petitioned the government for a \u00a320 per week pay rise for their members. They also wanted funding to train their members in paramedic skills. The Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, was keen not to raise inflation by awarding further pay increases. It was also carrying out reform of the National Health Service and thought a win over the unions would help cement this. In May 1989 the government offered a 7.5% pay rise; the unions recommended that their members accept this but it was rejected by a large majority. The unions seem to have underestimated the feelings of their members. == Limited service == Kenneth Clarke, pictured in 2010 Ambulance service crews voted on 7 September by a 4:1 majority to implement an overtime ban and a ban on rest-day working from 13 September. The ambulance services had relied on these additional hours to provide non-emergency services such as the transport of patients between hospitals. The services mitigated the effect of the union action by using private taxis to transport patients and asking, where possible, that patients provide their own transport. The health secretary, Kenneth Clarke, rejected an offer by the unions to enter arbitration on 22 September, causing negotiations to collapse. Later that month ambulance service officers and controllers voted to join the overtime ban from 4 October, reducing the options available to the ambulance services. From late September the negotiating committees of the ambulance officers and ambulance crew unions agreed to operate jointly; despite previous tension between the two. Roger Poole was selected as chief negotiator for the workers in the dispute and eventually came to represent members from five separate unions. Ambulance drivers in particular had been reliant upon overtime payments to supplement their basic wage and by early October were warning that they may have to soon return to work. The union responded in mid-October by escalating the action in an attempt to restart negotiations. A ban on some clerical work and non-urgent patient transfers was implemented. The latter caused issues as in previous actions doctors had responded by simply labelling all transfers as urgent, increasing the volume of work for the thinly stretched ambulance services. Other measures included lock-outs and sit-ins at depots and a public petition that eventually attracted 4 million signatures in support of the ambulance workers. There was little government response to the new measures, apart from to put the British Army on standby from 30 October to provide ambulance services if needed. The unions escalated matters further from November with emergency ambulance crews restricted to emergency 999 calls only and not providing transfer services, as they had previously. ==Strike== St John Ambulance staff and personnel, 1987 The government responded to the union escalation by threatening to dock the pay of crews who refused to carry out non-emergency work or to suspend them. The unions then advised that if any member was suspended then all members in that ambulance service should declare themselves as suspended. However the union asked that these members continue to provide an emergency service, though they would be unpaid. In London some 2,500 ambulance workers, responsible for 455 ambulances in 71 depots, were suspended by 7 November. The government thought that allowing ambulance workers to continue to respond to emergency calls on an unpaid basis would be bad publicity and the police and army were called in to provide emergency coverage. The first army ambulances were deployed on 8 November in London and, together with police and volunteer ambulance crews, ran 51 vehicles that day. This marked the first occasion that army ambulances had been used since the Winter of Discontent. Malcolm Rifkind, pictured in 1993 In Glasgow ambulance crews voted, by a narrow margin and against the advice of their union officials, for an all-out strike from 1 December, including the withdrawal of an emergency response. The strike lasted until 3 December and Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arranged for 30 army ambulances to provide emergency cover based out of Territorial Army (TA) drill halls. These, and police-manned ambulances, had responded to 200 calls by the early hours of 2 December. Rifkind alleged that the crews in Edinburgh had also refused to respond to emergency calls, though the crews disputed this. By December the British Army were providing emergency ambulance services in Lincolnshire, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. In Surrey Royal Navy and Royal Air Force drivers were also used, alongside ambulances single- crewed by ambulance service managers, to provide a service based out of police stations and TA drill halls. The ambulance unions attempted to reopen negotiations by dropping demands for a cut to working hours, additional leave and further long service perks. The government refused to make any compromises and, with few options left the unions carried out further action in January. Crews were instructed to refuse calls put through by the ambulance service and to only respond to those made directly by the police, medical services and general public. The unions hoped this would require the deployment of more army ambulances and swing public opinion behind them. The unions asked the public to demonstrate support for the strike by lining the streets at mid-day on 30 January. At around this time some union members lost patience and crews in West Sussex, Manchester and North-West London went on wildcat strikes of all services; a London-wide strike was narrowly averted at a meeting of shop stewards. In other places ambulance crews began to drift back to work. == Resolution == A 1990 Mersey Regional Ambulance Service vehicle In February the government made an indication that it was considering a revised pay offer but this was actually a stalling tactic, as they were waiting for public opinion to turn against the unions. The unions themselves were losing large amounts of their funds in paying strike benefits to their members. The National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) alone had paid out almost \u00a31 million while both the Transport and General Workers' Union and GMB were in deficit because of the strike. The non-ambulance crew members of these unions questioned why such large amounts were being spent on action which affected only a small portion of the membership. Indeed, the costs were so high that a pay dispute for ancillary workers, some of the lowest paid in the health service, was postponed because of a lack of funds. The unions escalated the strike further on 15 February, instructing members not to follow any orders issued by senior ambulance service managers. By this point the British Army was operating in 18 ambulance service areas. The two parties were brought together for conciliation talks by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. A joint industrial council was formed to consider a deal but talks broke down over the issue of back-pay for suspended workers. The government eventually relented on this issue and talks resumed on 22 February. A mutually acceptable pay rise of 16.9% over two years was agreed in the early hours of 23 February. The government also granted a \u00a3500 per year bonus to ambulance crew members with additional medical training and a further 2% pay rise in services that could offset the cost through efficiency savings. A vote of ambulance service workers approved the deal by 4:1; members of NUPE, the largest ambulance union, voted 85% in favour on a 74% turnout. The strike, one of the most successful of the Thatcher era, was called off. Poole claimed that the settlement he secured \"drove a coach and horses\" through the government's pay policy and in recognition of his success was named a runner-up in the Today programme's Man of the Year award. The strike led to greater recognition of the skill involved in the work of the ambulance crews and began their transformation into multi-skilled paramedics. ==Public opinion == A Royal Air Force Land Rover ambulance of the type used during the strike The strike has been noted for the close attention paid to public opinion during the dispute. The ambulance unions worked hard to court public approval and conducted polling throughout the strike to judge this. The recent Marchioness disaster of 20 August 1989 reminded the public of the importance of the emergency services and the ambulance crews' decision to respond to the Deal barracks bombing of 22 September 1989 was well received. The unions' efforts to ensure emergency cover was preserved was judged to be key to maintaining public approval. It was also noted that Poole's calm demeanour was well received by the public while Clarke's brusque manner and confrontational negotiation style led him to be perceived as a bully. The government attempted to mobilise public opinion against the strike by briefing the press on alleged incidents where ambulance crews had refused to respond to emergencies. These included claims, later proved false, that a crew in Becontree had refused to respond to a call about a newborn baby found in a ditch; that another crew refused to attend a call-out to a man with a severed foot and that one West Midlands ambulance station refused to provide emergency coverage for 48 hours. Clarke was questioned over these false claims in parliament after which they ceased. Another public relations move was implemented on 17 November; the government's pay offer of 6.5% over 12 months was amended to 9% over 18 months. While having little cost impact this appeared more generous. The Department of Health also took out full-page advertisements in national newspapers from 27 November, ostensibly to provide information on ambulance coverage but largely an attempt to sway public opinion. The unions judged that these were ineffective. Opinion polls conducted during the strike showed public support of around 80% in favour of strikers, including support of 75% among conservative voters. At its highest, only 10% of the public supported the government. It was judged that the unions' appointment of Poole as a single spokesman and negotiator was a good move, especially when compared with the government's fragmented response. A number of different spokesmen acted for the government and sometimes gave contradictory briefings leading to a public perception of a lack of coordination and competence. The Labour Party was steadfast in its support for the strike but there were splits in the Conservative Party, encouraged by lobbying from the unions. Some Conservative backbenchers spoke with Clarke privately to suggest that he agree a resolution to the strike. The Labour Party attempted to capitalise on this by raising a debate in parliament on the government's handling of the strike. This had the opposite effect as Conservative MPs rallied to support the government. == References == Category:1989 labor disputes and strikes Category:1990 labor disputes and strikes Category:1989 in the United Kingdom Category:1990 in the United Kingdom Category:Protests in the United Kingdom Category:Health and medical strikes Category:Labour disputes in the United Kingdom ",
