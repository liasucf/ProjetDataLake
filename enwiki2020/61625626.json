During the premiere show, it was announced Martyna Lewandowska received the most votes, therefore becoming the official housemate. * : On Day 4, Karolina was originally nominated. After nominations, Mateusz broke the rules by talking about nominations. After being questioned by \"Big Brother\", he had to indicate a person (from his nomination) he wanted to evict. That person was Karolina. As a result of Mateusz's action, Karolina was granted immunity and therefore saved from nomination. * : Anna was automatically nominated for eviction as punishment for placing last in the week's task. Mateusz was the winner of the same task and he was granted immunity. However, on Day 10 Mateusz was automatically nominated for eviction as punishment for his inappropriate behaviour towards Malwina during a party the night before. * : During the live show on Day 17 after the public vote ended, it was revealed that Karolina received 67% of votes to evict and \u0141ukasz received 18% of votes to evict. \u0141ukasz was given a choice by the Big Brother: he could either evict Karolina or leave the house himself. He chose to evict Karolina. \u0141ukasz was given immunity and could not be nominated for eviction. * : On Day 21, Aleksandra was ejected from the Big Brother house for breaking the rules by requesting viewers vote to evict Kamil. * : Martyna and Vasilis won the week's task and as a reward, their votes during nominations counted double. Sarah was granted immunity for completing a task. * : \u0141ukasz had to choose three housemates to be evaluated by viewers. He picked Anna, Dawid, and Mateusz. Anna received the most negative comments and was automatically nominated. Mateusz received the most positive comments and was granted immunity. * : Natalia D. was automatically nominated after losing a challenge. * : On Day 34 Kasia was ejected from the Big Brother house for constantly disobeying Big Brother. * : Kamil was chosen to be automatically nominated by several housemates as part of a task the previous week. * : As punishment for aggressive behaviour between Dawid, Kamil and Vasilis, there was online voting on Facebook. Dawid received the most votes and was automatically nominated for eviction. However, later that day it was announced that Dawid decided to leave the house. * : On Day 53 Martyna, Mateusz and Vasilis were automatically nominated for eviction for not completing tasks, disobeying and undermining the authority of the Big Brother. * : After Ewa left the house on Day 62, the eviction vote between her and Kamil was cancelled. * : On Day 66 three new potential housemates were introduced: Bart\u0142omiej, Ewelina and Sandra. However, only two of them became official housemates. Bart\u0142omiej was chosen by the six remaining housemates, while Sandra received more votes than Ewelina during voting on Facebook. * : Anna was chosen to be automatically nominated by the viewers during voting on Instagram. * : All housemates had to fight for the right to nominate. Martyna failed to complete a task and lost the right to nominate. * : Wiktor received a \"Golden Ticket\" from the viewers during voting on Instagram and automatically advanced to the final. * : On Day 80 Bart\u0142omiej was ejected for discussing nominations. * : During the week, former housemates were asked which of the remaining housemates least deserved to be in the final. They chose Sandra. Then the viewers on Instagram were asked \"Should Sandra be in the final?\" and 70% voted \"NO\", therefore Sandra was evicted. == Ratings == Official ratings are taken from Nielsen Audience Measurement. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 96%; margin- left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" |- ! !colspan=\"2\" |Week 1 !Week 2 !Week 3 !Week 4 !Week 5 !Week 6 !Week 7 !Week 8 !Week 9 !Week 10 !Week 11 !Week 12 !Week 13 |- !Monday | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ccc\" | - |286,352 |347,202 |415,210 |572,704 |486,798 |372,258 |454,584 |497,547 |523,809 |636,164 |493,493 |489,628 |517,272 |- !Tuesday |447,425 |318,567 |361,519 |375,837 |440,266 |454,584 |454,584 |490,378 |464,488 |473,696 |497,884 |482,088 |526,355 |- !Wednesday |483,219 |390,155 |347,202 |497,537 |436,687 |504,695 |429,528 |429,618 |442,089 |572,992 |497,464 |520,469 |489,408 |- !Thursday |400,893 |529,751 |451,004 |468,901 |458,163 |526,172 |451,004 |523,147 |541,006 |486,601 |455,226 |482,004 |392,315 |- !Friday |508,275 |340,043 |504,695 |340,043 |393,734 |454,584 |519,013 |590,601 |462,724 |479,569 |391,960 |463,292 |436,727 |489,216 |- !Saturday |261,296 |318,567 |221,923 |422,369 |336,464 |354,361 |343,622 |347,202 |381,250 |403,244 |420,628 |357,984 |340,171 |440,150 |- !Sunday |465,322 |479,640 |554,807 |791,047 |515,434 |680,086 |687,245 |655,030 |593,778 |829,465 |681,283 |736,720 |764,890 |1,057,401 |-style=\"background:#FFB6C1\"| !
