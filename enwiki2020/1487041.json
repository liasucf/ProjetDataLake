    "text": "The Lakewood BlueClaws are a Minor League Baseball team based in Lakewood, New Jersey. They are affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies are a member of the Class A South Atlantic League. Their home field is FirstEnergy Park. ==History== The BlueClaws moved to Lakewood from Fayetteville, North Carolina, where they had been known as the Fayetteville Generals and later as the Cape Fear Crocs. Their first season in Lakewood was 2001. The Phillies' previous South Atlantic League affiliate was based in Kannapolis, North Carolina, and known as the Piedmont Boll Weevils from 1995 to 2000 (the team is now known as the Kannapolis Intimidators). Prior to that, the team was based in Spartanburg, South Carolina. ==Fan support== Since their arrival in New Jersey, the BlueClaws have been a success at the gate. In each of their first five seasons, they averaged over 6,500 fans per game. On August 26, 2002, in a game against the Hickory Crawdads which the BlueClaws won 3\u20130, attendance was a South Atlantic League record 13,003. The BlueClaws have led the South Atlantic League in either average or total attendance every year, and became the fastest team in South Atlantic League history to reach the 2 and 3 million fan attendance mark. On August 24, 2009, Phillies pitcher Brett Myers threw a scoreless inning in a rehab assignment on the same day a seven-year-old from Toms River, New Jersey became the 4 millionth fan in team history. This box office success comes in the absence of great success on the field. In their first five seasons, the BlueClaws failed to qualify for the playoffs. Their overall record topped the .500 mark for the first time in 2004. All told, in their first eight seasons, the BlueClaws topped 10,000 fans at a game three times, most recently in 2010 when they retired Ryan Howard's #29. ==Other developments== On September 1, 2004, Ryan Howard became the first former BlueClaw to play in the major leagues, playing first base for the Phillies in a 7\u20132 loss to the Atlanta Braves at Citizens Bank Park. He played for the BlueClaws in the 2002 season. In 2005, he was named the National League Rookie of the Year, and in 2006 he was named the National League Most Valuable Player. In May 2007, while on the 15-day disabled list, Ryan Howard played two rehab games with the BlueClaws after suffering a hamstring injury. Each game drew over 8,000 fans and helped push the BlueClaws to a new team attendance record for the month of May. The 2008 World Champion Philadelphia Phillies featured several former BlueClaws on their roster. Former NL MVP Ryan Howard was with the BlueClaws in 2002. World Series MVP Cole Hamels was with Lakewood in 2003, and starting catcher Carlos Ruiz was a member of the original Lakewood BlueClaws roster, in 2001. The team offers a post-game fireworks show after every Friday home game, and at the ballpark, and seniors eat free every Thursday night. Thursday nights are \"Thirsty Thursdays\", with dollar Coors Light and soda, 50 cent wings and live music all night. During the 2009 season, the BlueClaws announced that the team would adopt a new logo, color scheme, and uniforms for the 2010 season. ==Records== ===Season records=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Season||Affiliation||Manager||First Half Record||Second Half Record |- |2001||Phillies||Greg Legg||28\u201342, 7th place North||32\u201337, 5th place North |- |2002||Phillies||Jeff Manto||33\u201336, 6th place North||36\u201334, 5th place North |- |2003||Phillies||Buddy Biancalana||22\u201347, 8th place North||35\u201334, 3rd place North |- |2004||Phillies||P.
