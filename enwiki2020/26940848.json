    "text": "The history of the Catholic Church in Canada extends back to the arrival of the earliest European explorers. A French priest accompanied the great explorer Jacques Cartier, performing the first ever recorded Holy Mass on Canadian soil on July 7, 1534, on the shores of the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula. It was followed by deliberate conversion of the First Nations into the fold of Catholicism. Soon after, more and more religious congregations set foot in Canada especially among French-speaking present-day Quebec. In this long history of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, a number of deceased persons of the Church have had their life and work declared worthy of achieving one of the four stages of canonization in the Catholic Church: Servants of God; Venerable; Beatification (Blessed); and, for some, full recognition as a Saint. ==Fondateurs== The list of Canadian Roman Catholic Saints (St.), Blesseds (Bl.) and Venerables (Ven.) includes six individuals called the Fondateurs, or Founders. These people are particularly venerated for establishing the Church in Canada. Generally, these are: St. Marguerite Bourgeoys, St. Marguerite d'Youville, St. Fran\u00e7ois de Laval, St. Marie de l'Incarnation, Bl. Catherine de Saint-Augustin and Ven. Jeanne Mance. Sometimes, Ven. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re is also included. ==Saints== ===The Canadian Martyrs=== The first Canadians to be canonized as saints were the Canadian Martyrs, eight Jesuit missionaries from Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, who were martyred in the mid-17th century in Canada and upstate New York. They comprised the six priests and two companions missioning to the Huron during colonial days of New France. These holy men were canonized by Pope Pius XI on June 29, 1930, for having been martyred for their faith. Their feast day is celebrated in Canada on September 26. * St. Jean de Br\u00e9beuf (1593\u20131649) * St. Noel Chabanel (1613\u20131649) * St. Anthony Daniel (1601\u20131648) * St. Charles Garnier (1605\u20131649) * St. Isaac Jogues (1602\u20131646) * St. Gabriel Lallemant (1610\u20131649) * St. Ren\u00e9 Goupil (1607\u20131642) * St. Jean de Lalande (1620\u20131646) ===Other Canadian saints=== St. Marguerite Bourgeoys (1620-1700) founded the Congregation of Notre Dame who are involved in providing Christian education to many parts of the world.
