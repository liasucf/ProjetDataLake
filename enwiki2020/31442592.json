It was first published on 14 July 1910. Its first publisher was Henry H. Palmer. He had previously published a newspaper in the neighboring town of Tumalo. He operated the newspaper with his wife Clara, who was also an experienced journalist.Pinkerton, Trish, \"A newspaper's centennial\", Redmond Spokesman online, Redmond, Oregon, 14 July 2010. In September 1911, the Palmers announced that The Spokesman had acquired a new press and paper cutter to improve newspaper printing and production. A typesetting machine was soon added. In January 1912, a new 1,200-pound linotype machine was installed to further improve the operation. However, on 26 February 1912 a fire started in a neighboring hardware store. It spread to adjacent buildings, burning down a grocery store, a bakery, a furniture store, and The Spokesmans office. Despite the fact that the loss exceeded their insurance coverage by $4,000, the Palmers were able to keep the newspaper going by using the presses at Redmond's other newspaper, The Oregon Hub and at The Bulletin in nearby Bend to print The Spokesman while new equipment was ordered. After several months in temporary quarters, the paper moved into a new stone building on the old office site. When new equipment, including another modern linotype machine, was installed, the Palmers began printing The Spokesman in their own production facility again. The sign atop the new office building announcing the home of The Redmond Spokesman was high and long. The Spokesman was Redmond's second paper. Its competition was The Oregon Hub, which was founded in 1909. A third community paper, the Redmond Enterprise, began publication in 1913. In 1914, the Palmers bought out the other two newspapers, leaving The Spokesman as Redmond's only newspaper. The Palmers sold The Spokesman to M.W. Pettigrew in 1916. The change in ownership was announced in the 17 February edition of the paper that year. Pettigrew had been in the newspaper business in Kansas, but had moved to central Oregon to become a farmer. He was the publisher and editor of the paper until 1920, when he sold the business to Douglas Mullarky.Hole, Leslie Pugmire and Trish Pinkerton, \"Notable People\", Images of America Redmond, Archadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2009, p. 48-49. Mullarky was an experienced newspaperman, having been a reporter for The Hub and the founder of the short- live Redmond Enterprise. He published The Spokesman until 1922.\"Perspective\", The Redmond Spokesman, Redmond, Oregon, 6 April 2011, p. 4.\"Mullarky Named Snell Secretary\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 10 December 1942, p. 1. He sold the newspaper to W.B. Russell and Edgar Bloom. Bloom and his wife bought Russell's share in the newspaper in 1925.\"Spokesman Wins Honors\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 21 September 1944, p.2.\"Redmond Spokesman Half Interest is Sold\", Bend Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 11 June 1925, p. 5. The Blooms ran the business until November 1931, when they sold it to Joe and Mary Brown. The Browns owned and published The Spokesman for the next 40 years, first as a couple and then Mary alone. Both of the Browns were graduates of the University of Oregon. Under their leadership the paper won the prestigious Hal E. Hoss memorial trophy three times in five years in the mid-1930s. Sponsored by the University of Oregon School of Journalism, the Hoss trophy honored the best weekly newspaper in the state of Oregon. After The Spokesman won it for the third time, the trophy was retired and presented to Joe Brown at a ceremony in Redmond.\"Redmond Editor Receives Trophy, Spokesman is Rated Best Weekly in Oregon\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 9 February 1939, p. 1. In 1939, the Browns built a new facility to house their newspaper operation. The building was constructed on two adjoining lots on 6th Street between C and D streets in downtown Redmond. The new building was one-story, built in the streamline moderne style. It had a fa\u00e7ade and was front to back. The building provided office space for the newspaper staff as well as housing the print shop.\"Redmond Spokesman Plans New Building\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 6 April 1939, p. 5.\"Streamline Modern\" , Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County Community Development Department, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 11 July 2001. In 1942, Mary Brown was elected president of the Oregon Press Conference while her husband was serving in the United States Navy. In 1955, she became sole owner of The Spokesman. She continued to run the business until 1971. In June 1971, Mary Brown sold The Spokesman to Western Communications, Inc.\"Redmond Spokesman sold to new publishing company\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 30 June 1971, p. 1. The first publisher after Western Communications took ownership of the paper was Robert Moody.\"Changing of the Guard\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 30 June 1971, p. 4. He stayed until 1975, when Carl Vertrees became publisher. Vertrees ran the paper for 26 years, winning the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association\u2019s Carl C. Webb award for long-term public service in 1992.\u201cBulletin wins merit award\u201d, The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 26 July 1992, p. D.3. When Vertrees retired in February 2001, Gary Husman moved from general manager to publisher. In 2010, Husman was elected president of the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association.\"Community Involvement: The Ultimate Team Sport\", Oregon Publisher, Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, Portland, Oregon, November 2008, pp. 2-3. In November 2012 Western Communications laid off a significant portion of the Redmond Spokesman staff and announced they would no longer be reporting \"hard news\" for the Redmond community. It was reported in 2017 that Western Communications had recently experienced difficulty paying employees on their regularly scheduled paydays. This was positioned by management as a prioritization of funds for other financial obligations. The Spokesman was purchased by Eastern Oregon Media Group in a bankruptcy auction in August 2019. It was part of the sale of The Bend Bulletin to EO Media Group. The Spokesman is under the Bulletin's umbrella. Its editor is Gerry O'Brien as of September 2019. == Western Communications == Today, The Spokesman remains part of Western Communication's family of publications, which includes five other Oregon newspapers and two California papers. Western Communications was founded by publisher Robert W. Chandler. It is headquartered in Bend, Oregon, 20 miles south of Redmond.\"Our History\", The Bulletin, Western Communications, bendbulletin.com, Bend, Oregon, 1 April 2011.
