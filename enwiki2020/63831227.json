PSG mainly played their home league games at the Parc des Princes in Paris, but once at the Stade de Paris in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine as well, registering an average attendance of 21,754 spectators per match. The club was presided by Daniel Hechter until January 1978, when Francis Borelli became the new president. The team was coached by player-manager Jean-Michel Larqu\u00e9. Mustapha Dahleb was the team captain. In January 1978, Daniel Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation for running a ticketing scheme at Parc des Princes. On January 8, 1978, PSG beat Olympique de Marseille 5\u20131 in his final match at the stadium as club president. Mustapha Dahleb offered Hechter the match ball after the final whistle and was then carried in triumph by the players while the fans in attendance chanted his name. The next day, Francis Borelli, who had been vice-president until then, became the new president. Carlos Bianchi, who arrived to Paris in June 1977, was Hechter's last big signing. The Argentine striker scored 37 goals in 38 league matches. ==Players== :As of the 1977\u201378 season. ===Squad=== ===Out on loan=== ==Transfers== :As of the 1977\u201378 season. ===Arrivals=== ===Departures=== ==Kits== French radio RTL was the shirt sponsor.
