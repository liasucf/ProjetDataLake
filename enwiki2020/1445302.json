    "text": "Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 5.5th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight- thousanders \u2013 for every two people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to. However, this is primarily because most climbers tend to try to ascend to the primary peak of Lhotse, rather than the lowest summit of the mountain. It was first climbed by Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter on May 12, 1970. On April 27, 1980, Nicolas Jaeger was seen for the last time at altitude during an attempted ascent of Lhotse Shar in Nepal, and is presumed dead. ==References== Category:Eight-thousanders of the Himalayas Category:Mountains of Nepal Category:Mountains of Tibet ",
