    "text": "The Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan\u2013C\u00e1diz railway is an important Iberian-gauge railway line in Spain. It branches from the Madrid\u2013Valencia railway at Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan and terminates in C\u00e1diz. It was once the only line linking Madrid to Seville, but now primarily serves local commuter rail services and regional traffic since the opening of the Madrid\u2013Seville high-speed rail line in 1992. ==Route== The line serves major Spanish cities including C\u00f3rdoba, Seville, Jerez de la Frontera and C\u00e1diz; along with a small branch to Ja\u00e9n at Linares- Baeza, and a second after Linares to Almer\u00eda of around . The line also branches off at C\u00f3rdoba as the C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga railway. In October 2015 the section of the line between Seville and to C\u00e1diz was upgraded to high-speed standard after 14 years of works and put in service by Alvia trains for speeds up to 200 km/h. ==Services== The line is used by Cercan\u00edas Madrid's C-3 service, the C-1 and C-4 of Cercan\u00edas Sevilla and the C-1 of Cercan\u00edas C\u00e1diz; along with numerous regional services along various stretches of the line. A Larga Distancia service runs the full distance between Madrid and Seville (although not all the way to C\u00e1diz), taking 7 hours and 41 minutes; since the opening of the AVE high-speed rail line travel has been reduced to 2 hours and 21 minutes non-stop, freeing up the older slower line for other traffic. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Iberian gauge railways ",
