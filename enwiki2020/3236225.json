    "text": "St\u00e9phen-Charles Chauvet (1885\u20131950), commonly known as Dr St\u00e9phen Chauvet, was the author of the first illustrated book about Easter Island, L'\u00cele de P\u00e2ques et ses myst\u00e8res, published in Paris in 1935. Chauvet never traveled to Easter Island; he derived much of his information from sources of mixed reliability. However, his book remains an important work, in particular, because of its many illustrations, some of which show objects that no longer exist. The French version of the book has never been republished. A Spanish translation, \"La isla de Pascua y sus misterios\" was published in Santiago, Chile, in 1946 and reprinted in 1970. An English translation has also been published. == See also == *History of Easter Island == References == * ==External links== *L'\u00eele de P\u00e2ques et ses myst\u00e8res (2004 on-line translation by Ann Altman, with all illustrations and additional biographical material on Chauvet) * Category:1885 births Category:1950 deaths Category:French male writers ",
