    "text": "The N23 road is a national primary road in Ireland, and is located entirely in County Kerry. The route is one of the shorter national primary routes, merely forming a link road between the N21 Limerick - Tralee route at Castleisland to the N22 Tralee - Killarney - Cork route at Farranfore. This facilitates traffic passing in the Limerick - Killarney direction or vice versa, allowing it to avoid detouring into Tralee. ==See also== *Roads in Ireland *Motorways in Ireland *National secondary road *Regional road ==References== *Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2006 \u2013 Department of Transport 23 Category:Roads in County Kerry ",
