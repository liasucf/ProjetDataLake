She also provided the voice of popular puppets, Manicka and Mrs. Katerina, who are the female equivalents of the Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek puppet characters. In addition, \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 worked as a voice actress as well. Notably, \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 provided the Czech language-voice of Lisa Simpson on the Czech version of the American animated sitcom, The Simpsons. The Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek Theater (S+H) had been founded in Prague by Josef Skupa in 1930 as Czechoslovakia's first professional puppet theater. \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1, who was born in Prague in 1944, began performing at the Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek Theater after completing secondary school. She graduated from the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts (DAMU) and became a full member of the S+H theater company in 1966. She began performing the lead role of the puppet girl, Manicka, in 1967. Manicka, who quickly became a popular character, was a friend of the established father-son puppets, Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek. \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 married Milo\u0161 Kirschner, a S+H puppeteer and theater director. In 1971, Kirschner created a new grandmother puppet, Mrs. Katerina, specifically for \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1, which added another female character to the ensemble. Since their creation, \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1's Manicka and Mrs. Katerina have become very popular in the Czech Republic. \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 also toured with the puppet theater internationally and performed her puppets in several foreign languages. \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 became the head of the Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek Theater in 1996, following the death of her husband that same year. She led the theater until her death in March 2017. In addition to her puppetry and voice acting on television shows, such as The Simpsons, \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 also authored several books and directed and wrote her own plays. In 2008, a Czech court awarded \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 the rights to utilize the Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek characters after an eight-year legal dispute, which allowed her Spejbl and Hurv\u00ednek Theater to continue its programs. In 2016, actress Marie \u0160imsov\u00e1 began performing in the role of the puppet, Manicka, due to \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1's declining health. Following a long illness, \u0160t\u00e1chov\u00e1 died at her home in Prague on March 22, 2017, at the age of 72. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1944 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Czech puppeteers Category:Czech actresses Category:Czech voice actresses Category:Czech theatre directors Category:20th-century Czech dramatists and playwrights Category:Czech female singers Category:Academy of Performing Arts in Prague alumni Category:21st-century Czech dramatists and playwrights Category:Czech women dramatists and playwrights Category:21st-century women writers Category:20th-century women writers ",
