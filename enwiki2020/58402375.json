Services were provided by trains on the Haddington line. ==History== The station was opened by the North British Railway in 1846. The line passed on to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and finally the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The station was closed to passengers in 1949 and to freight in 1968. ==Future== The majority of the former branch line was acquired by East Lothian District Council in 1978 and converted into a railway walk and cycleway. Local campaign group, RAGES (Rail Action Group East of Scotland) have long-term ambitions to reintroduce rail services to Haddington. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * * *RAILSCOT on North British Railway line Category:Disused railway stations in East Lothian Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1846 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1968 Category:Former North British Railway stations Category:Railway stations in East Lothian Category:1846 establishments in Scotland Category:1968 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Haddington, East Lothian ",
