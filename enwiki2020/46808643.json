The Telegraph, 16 January 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2015. ==Early life== Vladim\u00edr Nedv\u011bd was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, on 27 March 1917. He was born into a devoutly Christian household and would be sent to annual religious camps for children in the summer. Of this time and his relationship with God he recalled - For his education he attended Kyjov High School before joining the Czech Air Force in October 1936. At the military academy he trained as a navigator and graduated in 1938 with the rank of flight lieutenant. ==Wartime service== ===German invasion and escape=== With the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1939, Nedv\u011bd escaped to the west. With out identity papers he travelled by foot and train to Lebanon where he boarded a ship for France, which he reached in early 1940. However, the German invasion of France saw him needing to escape once more, this time to the United Kingdom in June 1940. ===Service with the Royal Air Force=== Upon reaching the United Kingdom, Nedv\u011bd enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He trained as a navigator and was deployed to No. 311 (Czech) Squadron, a Wellington bomber squadron. To his fellow Czech's he was known as Vlad, and Ned by his British colleagues.

After take off the men took over the flight (placing the Communist co-pilot under arrest) and took the aeroplane to a United States Air Force base near Munich in Germany.
