It has been vacant since the resignation of Duncan D. Hunter on January 13, 2020. Rep. Duncan Hunter pleads guilty to misusing campaign funds, is expected to resign from Congress, Los Angeles Times, Sarah D. Wire and Seema Mehta December 3, 2019. Retrieved December 3, 2019. From 2003 through 2013, California's 52nd consisted of many of San Diego's northern and eastern suburbs, Santee, including Lakeside, Poway, Ramona, La Mesa, Alpine, Winter Gardens, Borrego Springs and Spring Valley. Due to redistricting after the 2010 United States Census, much of this area is now part of the 50th District. Despite being indicted by a federal grand jury for misusing campaign funds, Hunter narrowly won re-election in 2018.Washington Post On December 3rd, 2019, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy misuse of campaign funds, and it was expected he would resign before being sentenced on March 17, 2020. On January 7, 2020, he submitted letters of resignation to both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Governor of California Gavin Newsom indicating that his resignation would take effect at close of business on January 13.Rep. Hunter Announces Resignation Date, Newsom Will Not Call Special Election, KNSD, Julie Watson and NBC 7 Staff January 7, 2020. Retrieved January 10, 2020. A day later, Newsom's office stated that there would be no special election to fill the seat, and so it will remain vacant until being filled in January 2021, subsequent to the regularly scheduled 2020 election. Ammar Campa-Najjar, the Democratic nominee for the seat in 2018, and Republican Darrell Issa, who formerly represented California's 49th congressional district, are competing in this election. Polls indicate a close election between Campa-Najjar and Issa. == Geography == The 50th district is based in San Diego County. It includes suburban and outlying areas of the county, including Fallbrook, San Marcos, Valley Center, Ramona, Escondido, Santee, Lakeside, parts of El Cajon and mountain and desert areas stretching east to the Imperial County line. It extends slightly into southwestern Riverside County and covers much of the city of Temecula. == Competitiveness == === In statewide races === {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! colspan=\"3\" | Election results from statewide races |- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\" !

An open special election was held on April 11, 2006. The top vote getter was Democrat Francine Busby, who won 44% of the vote. The second-place finisher was Republican Brian Bilbray, who won 15% of the vote. Paul King was the top Libertarian party vote getter, with 0.6% of the vote. Since no candidate received a simple majority, the top vote-getters in each party competed in a runoff or special general election on June 6, 2006 (the same day as the statewide California primary). Bilbray was sworn in on June 13, based on unofficial counts, two weeks before the election was certified. As a consequence of this action, a court challenge to the election results filed by voters was denied on jurisdictional grounds. This decision was appealed unsuccessfully. === 2006 === === 2008 === === 2010 === === 2012 === === 2014 === === 2016 === === 2018 === == Historical district boundaries == === 44th District === In the 1980s, was one of four encompassing San Diego. The district had been held for eight years by Democrat Jim Bates and was considered the most Democratic district in the San Diego area. However, Bates became bogged down in a scandal involving charges of sexual harassment. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham won the Republican nomination and hammered Bates about the scandal. Cunningham won by a point. The San Diego area was represented entirely by Republicans for only the second time since the city was split into three districts after the 1960 U.S. Census. After his victory, Cunningham changed his official residence from his Del Mar home to a condominium in the Mission Valley neighborhood in San Diego, so he could reside in the district that he represented in Congress. === 41st District === In the 1980s, was another of four encompassing San Diego. The northern San Diego County district had been held for 12 years by Republican Bill Lowery and was considered the most Republican district in the San Diego area. Most of the district became the after state redistricting following the 1990 U.S. Census. In 1992, Cunningham campaigned against Lowery in Lowery's district in the Republican primary. The new 51st District was more dominated by ethnic whites and was more conservative than Cunningham's more urban, former 41st District located farther south. Lowery was tainted by the House check kiting scandal and lost the primary to Cunningham. The latter, a Navy career officer, had run on a campaign theme of \"A Congressman We Can Be Proud Of.\" After winning, Cunningham changed his official residence back to his Del Mar home in the old 41st/new 51st District. === 2000s === From 2003 to 2013, the 50th district consisted of the northern coastal region of San Diego County and included the suburbs of San Marcos, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach, and Escondido. == In popular culture == On November 29, 2005, Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report declared on his show that the 50th Congressional District was \"dead\" to him after its insufficient support for his \"friend\" Duke Cunningham. Colbert placed the district on the show's ever-changing \"Dead to Me\" board, saying that he now considered the number of congressional districts in the United States to be 434. (The number became 433 when he retired the 22nd District of Texas for its insufficient support for Tom DeLay.) On March 1, 2006, he \"downgraded\" the 50th District's status from \"dead to me\" to \"never existed to me.\"List of The Colbert Report episodes, episodes 122 and 226. == See also == * List of United States congressional districts * United States congressional delegations from California == References == == External links == * sdvote.com: San Diego Voter Registrar * sos.ca.gov: Secretary of State Padilla Announces Results of Randomized Alphabet Drawing for June 7 Presidential Primary Election Ballots * GovTrack.us: California's 50th congressional district 50 Category:Government of San Diego County, California Category:Political districts in Riverside County, California Category:East County (San Diego County) Category:North County (San Diego County) Category:Escondido, California Category:Ramona, California Category:San Marcos, California Category:Santee, California Category:Temecula, California Category:Valley Center, California Category:Constituencies established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in California ",
