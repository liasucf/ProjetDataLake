    "text": "Autoroute 530 (A-530) is an autoroute located Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Quebec. The spur route links Autoroute 30 with Salaberry-de- Valleyfield and features two interchanges, one at Boulevard Pie XII and the other at Route 201. Originally, Autoroute 530 was to connect to Autoroute 20 and Autoroute 30 along the Route 201 corridor through Salaberry-de- Valleyfield, crossing the St. Lawrence River via the Monseigneur Langlois Bridge. Part of this highway was built during Autoroute 20 construction in Coteau-du-Lac, but designated as part of Route 201. Autoroute 530 was originally part of Autoroute 30, but was re-designated in 2012 when A-30 was realigned to cross the St. Lawrence River. ==Exit list== From west to east. ==Photo gallery== File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (1).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (2).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (3).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (4).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (5).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (6).jpg File:Quebec Autoroute 530 - EB (7).jpg ==References== ==External links== * Transports Quebec Map 530 ",
