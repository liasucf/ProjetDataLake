It averages 20 cm (8 inches) in length and lives in damp environments. Chinese red-headed centipede In ancient Chinese traditions, this centipede is used for its healing properties. It is said that putting a Chinese red head on a rash or other skin-disease will speed up the healing process. The roasted dry centipede is pulverized and used in Korea for the treatment of back pain, furuncles and sores. Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans is known for harbouring little aggression to other centipedes, a trait very rare amongst giant centipedes and allows it to be kept communally. Females are incubatoral mothers, guarding the eggs by wrapping their body around the clutch until it hatches. ==Venom== The venom of the Chinese red-headed centipede contains a small peptide toxin called RhTx, which increases activation of the TRPV1 ion channel, causing a localized burning pain. The crude venom is said to be toxic in mice and to induce platelet aggregation. In addition, another 26 neurotoxins belonging to 10 different groups of peptides have been identified. In January 2018 Chinese scientists found an antidote to the painful venom of centipede in the drug retigabine, used to treat epilepsy. ==See also== *Ssm spooky toxin ==References== ==External links== Category:Scolopendridae Category:Fauna of Yunnan Category:Taxa named by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch ",
