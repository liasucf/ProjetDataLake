    "text": "Getting happy, an experience seen almost exclusively in the Black Church and in Pentecostal churches generally, refers to the experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, usually involving ecstatic singing, dancing, and a general spiritual fervor. It is heavily associated with shout music (as the music and the bodily expression are largely inseparable). Accounts of nineteenth century African American slave spirituality use the term, as recorded in the book God Struck Me Dead: Voices of Ex-Slaves. :All of my people were great Christians. Shouting, singing, praying, and good old heartfelt religion make up the things that filled their lives. [...] Aunt Charlotte used to cry most all the time when she got happy. --an ex-slave preacher, in God Struck Me Dead, page 75. One of the early nineteenth century traditional 'Negro Spirituals' to use the phrase, is the following: :GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY :Good morning everybody :Good morning everybody, Lord :My soul got happy this morning :My soul got happy this morning, Lord :You may call me \u201chypocrite member\u201d :You may call me \u201chypocrite member\u201d, Lord :But my soul got happy, this morning :But my soul got happy this morning, Lord :I\u2019m going to see my mother :I\u2019m going to see my mother, Lord :Going to sit down by my Jesus :Going to sit down by my Jesus, Lord.
