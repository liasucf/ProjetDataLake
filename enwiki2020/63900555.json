    "text": "King Friedrich II inspects the potato cultivation around 1750 Cuisine of Berlin describes different aspects of Berlin's culinary offerings. On the one hand, it means the traditional Berlin cuisine of Berlin households with dishes such as K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse or Kassler and, on the other hand, often a rustic pub and snack kitchen, which has become increasingly international due to labor migration since the Second World War. Since German reunification, numerous top-class restaurants have also been added. ==History== Until the end of the 19th century, the Berlin kitchen was a simple kitchen, which emphasized hearty taste and saturation rather than refinement. In the 17th century, numerous Huguenots settled in Berlin and brought their cooking traditions with them. The Prussian-Protestant kitchen integrated these influences essentially through simplification. Typical ingredients were pork, goose and fish such as carp, eel and pike, cabbage, legumes such as peas, lentils and beans as well as beets, cucumbers and potatoes. What is striking \u2013 from today's perspective \u2013 is the frequent use of the noble crayfish, which made it possible to catch fish rich in Berlin in the 18th and 19th centuries. With the founding of the German Empire, Berlin became the capital of a world empire and the arrival from different provinces expanded the city's cooking tradition, and Berlin cuisine began to internationalize. Jewish and Eastern European types of preparation were added, which expanded the menu in the capital. In the 1920s, Berlin was one of the largest cities in the world. Numerous large hotels and restaurants offered different dishes. The Nazi regime and the Second World War of annihilation that followed put an end to this culinary diversity. While in the eastern part, as the de facto capital of the GDR, the upscale gastronomy almost completely disappeared and international influences did not appear for decades, the restaurant scene in the west recovered slowly from this break. The 6th-floor food hall at Kaufhaus des Westens The first restaurants for fine cuisine opened in the rebuilt City West after the war. During the division of Berlin, the delicatessen department of KaDeWe remained one of the largest of its kind in the world and is still very popular with city residents and tourists alike. The Berlin currywurst is said to have been invented in 1949 by Herta Heuwer from K\u00f6nigsberg, who was running a small snack stand in Charlottenburg at the time. In 1958, the Caf\u00e9 Kranzler opened on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, which wanted to follow the pre-war coffeehouse culture. The caf\u00e9 established itself in the following years as a West Berlin institution. Due to the labour migration after the Second World War, the Berlin kitchen internationalized again. Turkish immigrants are said to have invented the doner kebab in Kreuzberg in the 1970s, which is now considered one of the most typical Berlin snacks. Since reunification at the latest, Berlin has been able to establish itself again as a metropolis for gourmets. Even in the former eastern part such as Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg, there are now numerous restaurants with international offerings. In 2017, there were a total of seven restaurants that were awarded two Michelin stars. Another 14 restaurants received a star. In 2017, Berlin was the city with the most star restaurants in German-speaking countries. ==Typical dishes== ===Meat dishes=== \"Liver Berlin Style\" * \"Liver Berlin style\" \u2013 Fried veal liver with onions and apple slices on mashed potatoes *Eisbein \u2013 Pickled Ham Hock *Currywurst *Kassler \u2013 Salted and smoked roast pork *Roast goose \u2013 Traditional Christmas dinner in many Berlin households *K\u00f6nigsberger Klopse \u2013 Meatballs with anchovies and caper sauce *D\u00f6ner Kebab ===Fish dishes=== \"Aal Gr\u00fcn\" with potatoes\"Aal Gr\u00fcn\" (\"Green eel\") \u2013 Eel in herb sauce * Rollmops \u2013 Pickled herring filets * \"Polish carp\" \u2013 Carp in gingerbread sauce ===Vegetable dishes and side dishes=== Kartoffelpuffer with salmon and cream horseradish *Kartoffelpuffer \u2013 Potato Pancake, often found at Christmas markets, sweet with apple sauce and sugar or hearty with salmon and cream horseradish *Jacket potato with curd cheese and linseed oil * \"Teltower R\u00fcbchen\" \u2013 caramelized and then braised turnips; served as a side dish with roast goose or duck, roast pork, Kassel cutlets, tongue or meatloaf *Sauerkraut * \"Bratkartoffeln\" \u2013 Fried potatoes, served as a side dish or main course with fried egg ===Dessert=== * \"Berliner Luft\" \u2013 (\"Air of Berlin\") White wine cream with raspberry sauce * \"Mohnpielen\" \u2013 Bread pudding with poppy seeds * \"Rote Gr\u00fctze\" \u2013 Red fruit jelly ===Bakery products=== Berliner Pfannkuchen Berliner Pfannkuchen \u2013 Lard pastries filled with plum jam * Berliner Napfkuchen \u2013 Yeast cake with raisins * Berliner K\u00e4sekuchen \u2013 Cheese cake made from curd cheese mass with raisins and rum on a short pastry base * \"Liebesknochen\" (\" Love Bone\") \u2013 German word for Eclair ===Beverages=== Berlin has a long brewing tradition.
