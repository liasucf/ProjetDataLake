    "text": "The Dundas Shamrocks Junior Rugby League Football Club was formed in the mid-1960s as an attachment to St Patrick's Marist College Dundas' sports auxiliary for weekend rugby league within the Balmain Junior Rugby League competition. In the mid-1990s the school sports auxiliary ceased to exist and the club was rechristened the Dundas Shamrocks. The club has been a member of the Balmain Junior Rugby League since its inception in the 1960s and provides teams for age groups from under 6's to A-Grade. The club headquarters are located at the St Patrick's Marist College Dundas, on the corner of Kissing Point Road and Kirby Street, Dundas. The ground boasts some of the most magnificent fields (international and mod) within the Balmain Junior Rugby League and has excellent canteen and change room facilities.
