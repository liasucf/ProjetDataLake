    "text": "Hypatima isopogon is a moth in the family Gelechiidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1929. It is found in southern India. The wingspan is about 12 mm. The forewings are grey with a slight yellowish tinge, the disc sprinkled white towards the base. There is an elongate black dot beneath the costa near the base and a fusiform dark fuscous streak extending along the costa from one-fourth to two-thirds, trisected by two fine oblique white strigulae, preceded by a similar strigula and followed by a white dot. The first white strigula is located within the costal blotch extended to the middle of the disc, preceded there by some darker suffusion and a dark fuscous tuft, a white and dark fuscous tuft on the fold nearly beneath this. There are longitudinal streaks of dark fuscous suffusion from these tufts to a similar apical patch, the upper marked with a black dot and there is an irregular series of white specks crossing the wing at this point, with some scattered white scales towards the apex. The hindwings are subhyaline (almost glass like) grey, with the veins and terminal edge suffused darker grey.Exotic Microlepidoptera. 3 (17): 513. ==References== Category:Hypatima Category:Moths described in 1929 ",
