    "text": "William Pitts II (1790\u20131840) was an English silver-chaser and sculptor. ==Life== He was son of William Pitts I (c.1755 \u2013 after 1806), a silver-chaser to whom he was apprenticed in 1806, and his wife Mary Armitage. In 1812 he obtained the gold Isis medal from the Society of Arts for modelling. He was a draughtsman, and also tried painting; ambidextrous, he drew and modelled with either hand. Pitts gained a reputation for models and reliefs in neo-classical taste. A versatile artist, he made designs for plates and other domestic items. He also worked for Rundell & Bridge as a chaser. He ran into business and financial troubles, and committed suicide on 16 April 1840 by taking laudanum at his residence, 5 Watkins Terrace, Pimlico. ==Works== Pitts chased a portion of the \"Wellington Shield\" designed by Thomas Stothard for Green & Ward, and the whole of the \"Shield of Achilles\" designed by John Flaxman for Rundell & Bridge. In later life he modelled, in imitation of those, a \"Shield of \u00c6neas\" and \"Shield of Hercules\" from Hesiod only a portion of the former was carried out in silver. Pitts had a very prolific imagination, and In 1830 he executed the bas-reliefs in the bow-room and drawing-rooms at Buckingham Palace. He exhibited models at the Royal Academy, and made two designs for the Nelson monument. He executed for publication a series of outline illustrations to the works of Virgil, of which two numbers were published, and also a series of illustrations to Ossian, of which two were engraved in mezzotint, but never published. He made similar drawings to illustrate Horace and the Bacch\u00e6 and Ion of Euripides. ==Family== Pitts married at the age of nineteen, and left at least five children, of whom the third son Joseph Pitts II (baptised 1821, died 1880) was known as a sculptor. In 1846 Joseph executed a bust of George Stephenson that is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. ==Notes== Attribution Category:1790 births Category:1840 deaths Category:English silversmiths Category:English sculptors Category:English male sculptors Category:Draughtsmen Category:Suicides by poison ",
