    "text": "A number of midrashim exist which are smaller in size, and generally later in date, than those dealt with in the articles Midrash Haggadah and Midrash Halakah. Despite their late date, some of these works preserve material from the Apocrypha and Philo of Alexandria. These small works, were in turn used by later larger works, such as Sefer haYashar (midrash) and Zohar. Important editors and researchers of this material include Abraham ben Elijah of Vilna, Adolf Jellinek, and Solomon Aaron Wertheimer. == Principal works == The chief of these works are: * Midrash Abba Gorion, a late midrash to the Book of Esther * Midrash Abkir, on the first two books of the Torah. Only fragments survive. * Midrash Al Yithallel, stories about David, Solomon, and the rich Korah * Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot, a haggadah for Shavuot * Chronicle of Moses (or Divrei ha-Yamim shel Mosheh) * Midrash Eleh Ezkerah, on the execution of the ten sages by the Roman emperor Hadrian. * Midrash Eser Galiyyot, the ten exiles of the Jews up to the time of Hadrian. * Midrash Esfah, on verses from the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy. Only fragments survive. * Midrash Hallel. See Midrash Tehillim * Midrash Leku Nerannena, a collection for Hanukkah. Only fragments survive. * Midrash Ma'aseh Torah, a compilation of doctrines and rules. * Midrash Petirat Aharon, a telling of the death of Aaron. * Midrash Petirat Mosheh, a telling of the death of Moses. * Midrash Taame Haserot ve-Yeterot, inferences from the presence or not of matres lectionis, and about qere and ketiv. * Midrash Tadshe (also called Baraita de- Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair), on the symbolism of the Tabernacle, and various symbolic numbers. * Midrash Temurah (called by Me'iri Midrash Temurot), on duality in the natural world. * Midrash Veyechulu, on several books of the Torah. Only citations survive. * Midrash Vayisau, a story of the sons of Jacob, warring against their enemies. * Midrash Vayosha, an aggadah for the seventh day of Passover. == Survey of Collections== The more recent (circa 1900) collections of small midrashim referred to above and in Midrash Haggadah are the following: *A.
