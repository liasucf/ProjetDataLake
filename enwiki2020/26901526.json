    "text": "In mathematics, Welch bounds are a family of inequalities pertinent to the problem of evenly spreading a set of unit vectors in a vector space. The bounds are important tools in the design and analysis of certain methods in telecommunication engineering, particularly in coding theory. The bounds were originally published in a 1974 paper by L. R. Welch. ==Mathematical statement== If \\\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_m\\\\} are unit vectors in \\mathbb{C}^n, define c_\\max = \\max_{i eq j} |\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle|, where \\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle is the usual inner product on \\mathbb{C}^n. Then the following inequalities hold for k=1,2,\\dots: : (c_\\max)^{2k} \\geq \\frac{1}{m-1} \\left[ \\frac{m}{\\binom{n+k-1}{k}}-1 \\right] ==Applicability== If m\\leq n, then the vectors \\\\{x_i\\\\} can form an orthonormal set in \\mathbb{C}^n. In this case, c_\\max=0 and the bounds are vacuous. Consequently, interpretation of the bounds is only meaningful if m>n. This will be assumed throughout the remainder of this article. ==Proof for k = 1== The \"first Welch bound,\" corresponding to k=1, is by far the most commonly used in applications. Its proof proceeds in two steps, each of which depends on a more basic mathematical inequality. The first step invokes the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality and begins by considering the m\\times m Gram matrix G of the vectors \\\\{x_i\\\\}; i.e., : G=\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\langle x_1, x_1 \\rangle & \\cdots & \\langle x_1, x_m \\rangle \\\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\ \\langle x_m, x_1 \\rangle & \\cdots & \\langle x_m, x_m \\rangle \\end{array}\\right] The trace of G is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Because the rank of G is at most n, and it is a positive semidefinite matrix, G has at most n positive eigenvalues with its remaining eigenvalues all equal to zero. Writing the non-zero eigenvalues of G as \\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_r with r\\leq n and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the inner product of an r-vector of ones with a vector whose components are these eigenvalues yields : (\\mathrm{Tr}\\;G)^2 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^r \\lambda_i \\right)^2 \\leq r \\sum_{i=1}^r \\lambda_i^2 \\leq n \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i^2 The square of the Frobenius norm (Hilbert-Schmidt norm) of G satisfies : ||G||^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i^2 Taking this together with the preceding inequality gives : \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^m |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2\\geq \\frac{(\\mathrm{Tr}\\;G)^2}{n} Because each x_i has unit length, the elements on the main diagonal of G are ones, and hence its trace is \\mathrm{Tr}\\;G = m. So, : \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2 = m+\\sum_{i eq j} |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2 \\geq \\frac{m^2}{n} or : \\sum_{i eq j} |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2 \\geq \\frac{m(m-n)}{n} The second part of the proof uses an inequality encompassing the simple observation that the average of a set of non-negative numbers can be no greater than the largest number in the set. In mathematical notation, if a_{\\ell}\\geq 0 for \\ell=1,\\ldots, L, then : \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^L a_{\\ell} \\leq \\max a_{\\ell} The previous expression has m(m-1) non-negative terms in the sum, the largest of which is c_\\max^2. So, : (c_\\max)^2\\geq \\frac{1}{m(m-1)}\\sum_{i eq j} |\\langle x_i , x_j \\rangle|^2\\geq\\frac{m-n}{n(m-1)} or : (c_\\max)^2\\geq \\frac{m-n}{n(m-1)} which is precisely the inequality given by Welch in the case that k=1. ==Achieving Welch bound equality== In certain telecommunications applications, it is desirable to construct sets of vectors that meet the Welch bounds with equality. Several techniques have been introduced to obtain so-called Welch Bound Equality (WBE) sets of vectors for the k = 1 bound. The proof given above shows that two separate mathematical inequalities are incorporated into the Welch bound when k=1. The Cauchy- Schwarz inequality is met with equality when the two vectors involved are collinear. In the way it is used in the above proof, this occurs when all the non-zero eigenvalues of the Gram matrix G are equal, which happens precisely when the vectors \\\\{x_1,\\ldots,x_m\\\\} constitute a tight frame for \\mathbb{C}^n. The other inequality in the proof is satisfied with equality if and only if |\\langle x_i, x_j \\rangle| is the same for every choice of i eq j. In this case, the vectors are equiangular. So this Welch bound is met with equality if and only if the set of vectors \\\\{x_i\\\\} is an equiangular tight frame in \\mathbb{C}^n. ==References== * * Category:Inequalities ",
