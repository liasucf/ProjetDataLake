It is native to many of the western Transverse Ranges, Inner California Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada in California, and its range extends just into Nevada. ==Description== Keckiella breviflora is a branching, bushy shrub with many thin stems, approaching a maximum height near two meters. Its shiny green leaves are arranged oppositely on the branches, and each is one to four centimeters long, generally lance-shaped and finely serrated or smooth along the edges. The shrub produces tall inflorescences which are loose, glandular spikes of flowers. Each flower is one to two centimeters wide with five pale pink or pinkish-streaked white lobes whose external surfaces have long, shiny hairs. The three lower lobes curl outward from the mouth and under, and the two upper lobes are joined into a lip that curves forward over the mouth. Within the mouth are long stamen filaments bearing anthers, and a flat, hairless, sterile stamen called a staminode. ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment of Keckiella breviflora *Keckiella breviflora \u2014 UC Photos gallery breviflora Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Nevada Category:Flora of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California) Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges ",
