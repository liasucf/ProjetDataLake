    "text": "The Hyundai \u03b1-series(alpha-series) is a multi-valve, four cylinder engine family comprising 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6L naturally aspirated versions and a 1.5L turbocharged version. Introduced in 1992, this was Hyundai's first engine designed entirely in-house. Design objectives were to provide high performance and good fuel economy with excellent durability at a reasonable cost.http://papers.sae.org/891185/ The first \u03b1-series engine marketed was the \u03b1-1.5D (Engine code:G4EK). It was a single overhead camshaft (SOHC), twelve (12) valve, inline-four, petrol-based and naturally aspirated version. An \u03b1-series inline-four, dual overhead camshaft (DOHC), four valve per cylinder version later developed from the \u03b1-1.5D.https://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-19/business/fi-4835_1_pikes-peak The \u03b1-series engine debuted in the 1992 Hyundai Scoupe Asia Korea and Europe market and later used in other Hyundai models.https://www.automobilemag.com/news/hyundai-engines/amp/ The \u03b1-series engine were initially produced in 1.3 L and 1.5 L, with only the 1.5 L offered in North America. A strengthened block, an eight-counterweight crankshaft, and hydraulic engine mounts were added in 2000 to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness). A 1.6 L version was introduced in 2001 and initially sold alongside earlier versions. The 1.3 L and 1.5 L were later dropped. The 1.6 L engine was further revised in 2005 with a 1.4 L version also available for certain markets. Known as the Alpha II it debuted in the Kia Rio JB. Notable features included a DOHC 16-valve cylinder head, graphite-coated pistons, a strengthened cylinder block, ribbed aluminum oil pan, coil-on-plug ignition, an enlarged throttle body (increased from 48 mm to 52 mm), a revised PCM (powertrain control module), simplified and shortened intake ducting, a revised intake manifold, and a returnless fuel system. These improvements further reduced NVH and emissions, with the 1.6 L version becoming ULEV- certified in all 50 U.S. states. In 2011 the Alpha engine was replaced with the Hyundai Gamma engine. ==1.3== G4EH in a 1999 Hyundai Accent L The G4EA/G4EH is a SOHC 12-valve 1.3 L (1341 cc) engine, with a bore and stroke of 71.5 mm and 83.5 mm, respectively. Output was 71 hp (53 kW) at 5500 rpm and 81 lb\u00b7ft (110 N\u00b7m) at 3000 rpm for the carbureted G4EA and 83 hp (62 kW) at 5500 rpm and 86 lb\u00b7ft (117 N\u00b7m) at 3000 rpm for the G4EH with electronic fuel injection. The 1.3 L engine wasn't available in North America. ==\u03b1-1.5D 12vG4EK== The \u03b1-1.5D 12v (G4EK) is an in-line four, single overhead camshaft (SOHC), 12 valves (3-valves/cylinder); spark-ignition 4-stroke engine. An \u03b1-1.5D-equipped vehicle's power output varies from the market it was sold. The naturally aspirated engine's advertised power and torque per market is listed below: Europe Market: 65 kW (87 hp/ 88 PS) DIN with 132 Nm (97 lb-ft) of torque North America market: 68.5 kW / 92 hp / 93 PS SAE net and 132 Nm (97 lb-ft) of torque. Asia Korea Domestic Market: 75 kW (101 hp/ 102 PS JIS net and 142 Nm (105 lb-ft) of torque.

It utilized the 75.5 mm bore of the original 1.5 L engine, but was destroked to 78.1 mm. Other design improvements of the 1.6 L G4ED carried over to the 1.4 L G4EE, except for CVVT. The engine was noted for its smoother, freer revving nature as compared to the larger 1.6 L due to its squarer bore:stroke dimensions. It also produced slightly improved fuel consumption, but at the expense of overall power output. ===Applications=== * 2005\u20132011 Hyundai Accent * 2005\u20132011 Hyundai Getz * 2004\u20132007 Kia Cerato * 2005\u20132011 Kia Rio/Rio5 ==See also== * List of Hyundai engines ==References== *1992 Hyundai S-Coup\u00e9 LS specifications - Carfolio.com *1992 Hyundai S-Coup\u00e9 GT specifications - Carfolio.com *Hyundai 1.6L Alpha Engine *Hyundai Accent History *2006 Hyundai Accent Press Release Alpha Category:1992 introductions Category:Inline-four engines ",
