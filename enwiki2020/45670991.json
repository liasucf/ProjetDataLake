    "text": "De Tranquillitate Animi (On the tranquility of the mind) is a Latin work by the Stoic philosopher Seneca (4 BC-65 AD). The dialogue concerns the state of mind of Seneca's friend Annaeus Serenus, and how to cure Serenus of anxiety, worry and disgust with life. ==Background== Around 400 B.C., Democritus wrote a treatise On Cheerfulness (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b7\u03c2; Peri euthymi\u00e9s). The term euthymia, or \"cheerfulness\", can mean steadiness of the mind, well-being of the soul, self-confidence. Seneca lauds Democritus in relation to his treatise on the subject, and states that he will use the Latin word tranquillitas as a rough translation of euthymia.Volume 2 of History of rhetoric Writing a little later than Seneca, Plutarch wrote a similar work, described in the 1589 translation as, \"a philosophical treatise concerning the quietness of the mind\".catalogue showing - A philosophicall treatise concerning the quietnes of the mind.

It has often been dated to around 60 AD on the (possibly wrong) assumption that the theme of the dialogue reflects Seneca's own deteriorating political situation at court.Fritz-Heiner Mutschler in Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist, pages 153-4 [Retrieved 2015-3-14] ==Title and contents== The title when translated into English means on the tranquility of the mind (or) soul. The word animi is translated, in a general sense, as the rational soul, and in a more restricted sense, as the mind as a thing thinking, feeling, willing. T. M. Green provides definitions of animus, animi as being soul, mind and also courage, passion. Monteleone translated tranquillitas animi as, mental equilibrium.Perseus Digital Library - Tufts University Search Tools - Latin Word Study Tool (for expanded definitions see page under Lewis & Short) [Retrieved 2015-3-14]T.

The superior position ho sophos (the sage) inhabits, of detachment from earthly (terrena) possibilities of future events of a detrimental nature, is the unifying theme of the dialogues.R Bett - A Companion to Ancient Philosophy - p.531 (edited by Mary Louise Gill, Pierre Pellegrin)[Retrieved 2015-3-19] (ed. Bett was source of term ho sophos) Compared with the other two works, the intention of De Tranquillitate Animi is more therapeutic.M. T. Griffin - Seneca on Society: A Guide to De Beneficiis, page 146. Oxford University Press, 14 Mar 2013 [Retrieved 2014-3-14] The work opens with Serenus asking Seneca for counsel, and this request for help takes the form of a medical consultation. Serenus explains that he feels agitated, and in a state of unstable immobility, \"as if I were on a boat that doesn't move forward and is tossed about.\" Seneca uses the dialogue to address an issue that cropped up many times in his life: the desire for a life of contemplation and the need for active political engagement. Seneca argues that the goal of a tranquil mind can be achieved by being flexible and seeking a middle way between the two extremes. If we want to achieve peace of mind, Seneca recommends an austere life, oblivious to excessive and useless luxury. He advises us to choose our companions carefully, since if we choose those that are corrupted by the vices, their vices will extend to us (chapter 7). Austerity is the main treatment for peace of mind: we have to learn to know how to contain ourselves, curb our desires, temper gluttony, mitigate anger, to look at poverty with good eyes and to revere self-control (chapter 8). Seneca compares those who have a lot and do not know how to enjoy it to a person who owns a large library of books for mere display (chapter 9). In chapter 11, Seneca introduces the figure of the Stoic sage, whose peace of mind (ataraxia) springs directly from a greater understanding of the world. The sage's complete security and self-sufficiency exclude the unhealthy passions (apatheia), i.e disturbances which cannot upset the person who is, by definition, rational. Only reasoning, caution, and foresight can create in someone the ideal atmosphere of peace. The philosopher, while preserving his peace of mind, does not hate humanity for its injustice, vileness, stupidity and corruption. The times we live in are no worse than the preceding ones, it is not reasonable to waste time raging about these evils, it is more reasonable to laugh at them (chapter 15). Thus the right treatment is to follow nature, find the right balance between sociability and solitude, labour and leisure, sobriety and intoxication, and to \"watch over our vacillating mind with intense and unremitting care\" (chapter 17). ==Later history== The first extant copy of the work is as part of the codex Ambrosianus (no. 90), of the Ambrosianus library in Milan, dating from the 11th century A.D. == References == ==Further reading== ===Translations=== *Elaine Fantham, Harry M.
