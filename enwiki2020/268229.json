    "text": "In geometry, a vertical translation (also known as vertical shift) is a translation of a geometric object in a direction parallel to the vertical axis of the Cartesian coordinate system.... The graphs of different antiderivatives of the function f(x) = 3x2 \u2212 2\\. All are vertical translates of each other. Often, vertical translations are considered for the graph of a function. If f is any function of x, then the graph of the function f(x) + c (whose values are given by adding a constant c to the values of f) may be obtained by a vertical translation of the graph of f(x) by distance c. For this reason the function f(x) + c is sometimes called a vertical translate of f(x).. For instance, the antiderivatives of a function all differ from each other by a constant of integration and are therefore vertical translates of each other.. ==See also== * Horizontal translation ==References== Category:Elementary geometry ",
