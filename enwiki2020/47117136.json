It is managed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. == History == The hospital has its origins in the Henry Brock Hospital which opened in a converted private house in 1924. After the Second World War it was decided to commission a purpose-built facility: the new hospital was designed by Keppie Henderson & Joseph Gleave and built on a site adjacent to Henry Brock Cottage Hospital between 1951 and 1955. The horizontal form of the hospital was designed to survive the horizontal blast of an atomic bomb being dropped on the Clyde\u2019s submarine bases. == Services == The hospital has 92 inpatient beds as well as a Minor Injuries Unit. The hospital has approximately 47 births per year and has full accreditation as baby friendly, since 2006. This is down from 900 births per year in 2002. ==Performance== An Inquiry was set up by Scottish Ministers to investigate the occurrence of C. difficile infection at the hospital from 1 January 2007 onwards. The Inquiry published its final report on 24 November 2014. The findings of the inquiry were considered by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland, when they produced a report in July 2015, entitled \u201cLearning from serious failings in care\u201d. ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Category:NHS Scotland hospitals Category:Vale of Leven Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in Scotland Category:Hospitals established in 1955 ",
