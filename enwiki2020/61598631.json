    "text": "350px Cromwell with the Coffin of Charles I is a partially-varnished c.1831 watercolour by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, now in the D\u00e9partement des Arts graphiques of the Louvre in Paris. ==Production== The work was painted as a reaction against Paul Delaroche's Cromwell and Charles I, exhibited at the 1831 Paris Salon, the first to be held after the July Revolution and Louis-Philippe I's seizure of power - Delacroix's own Liberty Leading the People had been exhibited at the same Salon. Both works are based on a fictional account by Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand of Oliver Cromwell opening Charles I's coffin after the latter's execution.Susanne Zantop, Paintings on the move, Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press, 1989, 194 p., , . Delaroche's work was less a portrayal of an event than an oblique comment on the French Revolution and Louis XVI's execution,Michael J. Braddick, The Oxford Handbook of the English Revolution, OUP Oxford, 2015, 640 p., , . with Cromwell standing in for Napoleon.Martin Meisel, Realizations : Narrative, Pictorial, and Theatrical Arts in Nineteenth-Century England, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2014, 492 p., , . Besides this nostalgia for France's Ancien R\u00e9gime, Delaroche was attempting to find a middle way between Ingres' neoclassicism and Delacroix's romanticismMary Lathers, Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850, Christopher John Murray \u00e9d., New York, Routledge, 2013, 1336 p., , . Delaroche's version of the scene Delacroix was not alone in critiquing Delaroche's painting - Punch even published a parody of it in 1852 entitled Louis Napol\u00e9on Looking at the Corpse of LibertyPunch : Or the London Charivari, , read online According to a letter from Delacroix to his painter friend Paul Huet, Delacroix chose to produce the work in watercolour to express a radical opposition to Delaroche's approach.Stephen Bann, Paul Delaroche : History Painted, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1997, 304 p. , . Delacroix's work imitated Delaroche's historical realism but as a small watercolour not a huge canvas. It also added Delacroix's own romanticism, which attempted to revive the past by evoking emotion.Historical Abstracts : 1775-1914, vol. 45, no.s 3-4, American Bibliographical Center, Clio, 1994, p. 906. Unlike Delaroche, Delacroix preferred to imagine an evolving and troubled Cromwell on the edge of the scene not at its centre, finding the coffin by accident.

It recalls the watercolour style of Delacroix's friend Richard Parkes Bonington, even down to the theatrical curtain above Charles' head. Unlike in Delaroche's work, all but Charles' head is unseen, recalling his beheading. Delaroche ignored the criticism of his work and showed Cromwell again in his Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers in 1836, which was so strongly savaged by the critics that Delaroche never exhibited at the Paris Salon again and barely exhibited outside it either. Delacroix's work was acquired in December 1942 from Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9rard for 8750 Reichsmarks (175,000 francs) for the Museum Folkwang in Essen, but was returned to the Louvre in 1948 as part of the first consignment of looted art to leave D\u00fcsseldorf. After its return to France it was assigned to the Louvre. ==References== == Bibliography == * L\u2019Invention du Pass\u00e9.
