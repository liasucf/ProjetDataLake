During the 13th century the church was a part of Baynard's Castle, an ancient royal residence.\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p62:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 In 1361, Edward III moved his Royal Wardrobe (a storehouse for Royal accoutrements, housing arms and clothing among other personal items of the Crown) from the Tower of London to just north of the church. It was from this association that the church acquired its unique name. The Wardrobe and the church, however, were both lost in the Great Fire of London in 1666.\"The Old Churches of London\" Cobb,G: London, Batsford, 1942 Of the 51 churches designed by Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe is among the simplest of his designs; it was erected in 1695. The church was again gutted during the London blitz by German bombing; only the tower and walls survived. It was rebuilt and rededicated in 1961. ==Advowson== The advowson of St Andrew's was anciently held by the family of FitzWalter to which it probably came from the holding by Robert Fitzwalter (d.1235) of the office of Constable of Baynard's Castle.Thornbury, Walter. Old & New London, Vol.1, pp.302-3 In 1417 it was held by Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (d.1417), as his charter dated 24 June 1417 appointing feoffees to his estate records.Jeayes Charters, no.581 Berkeley's Inn, the town house of that family stood nearby, at the south end of Adle Street, against Puddle Wharf, as reported by John Stow in his \"Survey of London\" (1598)Quoted in Thornbury, op.cit ==Building== The steps leading from the street up to the ground-level of the church are steep St Andrew's is situated on a terrace overlooking the street, its plain red-brick exterior contrasting with the stone buildings on either side. The interior is aisled, with arcaded bays supported by piers rather than the usual columns.\"The City of London Churches\" Betjeman,J Andover, Pikin, 1967 The original interior fittings were mostly destroyed during the war, and many of the church's features were procured from other destroyed Wren churches. The weathervane on the steeple comes from St Michael Bassishaw (which was demolished in 1900). A replacement pulpit came from the church of St Matthew, Friday Street.\"The London Encyclopaedia\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) The font and cover also came from here. The royal arms, of the House of Stuart, came from St Olave Old Jewry (demolished, except for its tower, in 1887). There is a figure of St Andrew, dated around 1600, which stands on the north side of the sanctuary and an unusual figure of Saint Anne who is shown holding the Virgin Mary who in turn holds the Christ child. This statue, which is probably north Italian, dates to around 1500. William Shakespeare was a member of this parish for about fifteen years while he was working at the Blackfriars Theatre nearby, and later he bought a house within the parish, in Ireland Yard. In his honour, a memorial was erected in the church.The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 Regular Sunday services are conducted there by the St Gregorios congregation of the Indian Orthodox Church.Church website Retrieved 29 October 2009 The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. ==Notable clergy== * Guy Treweek (husband of Rachel Treweek, the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England), was priest-in-charge from 2011 to 2015 * Luke Miller, priest-in-charge from 2015 to 2016 ==See also== St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe Interior * List of churches and cathedrals of London * List of Christopher Wren churches in London ==Notes== ==External links== * Church Website * Location map (Multimap.com) * 360\u00b0 panorama inside St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe Category:Churches completed in 1695 Category:17th- century Church of England church buildings Category:Church of England church buildings in the City of London Category:Christopher Wren church buildings in London Category:English Baroque architecture Andrew Category:Rebuilt churches in the United Kingdom Category:Diocese of London Category:Grade I listed churches in the City of London Category:1695 establishments in England ",
