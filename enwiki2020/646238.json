    "text": "Robert Brian \"Robin\" Cook (born May 4, 1940)Stookey, Lorena Laura (1996). Robin Cook: A Critical Companion, Westport, Connecticut, London: Greenwood Press. is an American physician and novelist who writes about medicine and topics affecting public health. He is best known for combining medical writing with the thriller genre. Many of his books have been bestsellers on The New York Times Best Seller List. Several of his books have also been featured in Reader's Digest. His books have sold nearly 400 million copies worldwide.AEI Speakers, American Entertainment International Speakers Bureau. \"Robin Cook Biography\". Second and fifth paragraphs. Retrieved April 8, 2012. ==Early life and career== Cook was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Woodside, Queens, New York City. He moved to Leonia, New Jersey when he was eight, where he could first have the \"luxury\" of having his own room. He graduated from Wesleyan University and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and finished his postgraduate medical training at Harvard.Cooking Another Medical Thriller , Naple News. By Sandy Reed. \"Q&A; about [Robin Cook's] 31st book and much more.\" Sixth paragraph. March 27, 2012. Retrieved April 7, 2012. Cook ran the Cousteau Society's blood-gas lab in the south of France. He later became an aquanaut (a submarine doc) with the U.S. Navy's SEALAB program when he was drafted in 1969. Cook served in the Navy from 1969 to 1971, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. He wrote his first novel, Year of the Intern, while serving on the Polaris submarine . ==Novelist== The Year of the Intern was a failure, but Cook began to study bestsellers. He said, \"I studied how the reader was manipulated by the writer. I came up with a list of techniques that I wrote down on index cards. And I used every one of them in Coma.\" He conceived the idea for Coma, about illegally creating a supply of transplant organs, in 1975. In March 1977, that novel's paperback rights sold for $800,000. It was followed by the Egyptology thriller Sphinx in 1979 and another medical thriller, Brain, in 1981. Cook then decided he preferred writing over a career in medicine. Cook's novels combine medical fact with fantasy. His medical thrillers are designed, in part, to keep the public aware of both the technological possibilities of modern medicine and the ensuing socio-ethical problems which come along with it. Cook says he chose to write thrillers because the forum gives him \"an opportunity to get the public interested in things about medicine that they didn't seem to know about. I believe my books are actually teaching people.\" The author admits he never thought that he would have such compelling material to work with when he began writing fiction in 1970. \"If I tried to be the writer I am today a number of years ago, I wouldn't have very much to write about. But today, with the pace of change in biomedical research, there are any number of different issues, and new ones to come,\" he says. Cook's novels have anticipated national controversy. In an interview with Stephen McDonald about the novel Shock, Cook admitted the book's timing was fortuitous: To date, Cook has explored issues such as organ donation, fertility treatment, genetic engineering, in vitro fertilization, research funding, managed care, medical malpractice, medical tourism, drug research, and organ transplantation. Many of his novels revolve around hospitals (both fictional and non-fictional) in Boston, which may have to do with the fact that he underwent his post-graduate training at Harvard and has a residence in Boston, or in New York. ===Personal life=== He is on leave from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Cook is a private member of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees, led by chairman Joseph B. Gildenhorn, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States. ==Bibliography== * Year of the Intern (1972), * Coma (1977), * Sphinx (1979), * Brain (1980), * Fever (1982), * Godplayer (1983), * Mindbend (1985), * Outbreak (1987), * Mortal Fear (1988), * Mutation (1989), * Harmful Intent (1990), * Vital Signs (1991), * Terminal (1993), * Fatal Cure (1993), * Acceptable Risk (1995), * Invasion (1997), * Toxin (1998), * Abduction (2000), * Shock (2001), * Seizure (2003), * Death Benefit (2011), * Nano (2013), * Cell (2014), * Host (2015), * Charlatans (2017), ;Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery series * Blindsight (1992), * Contagion (1995), * Chromosome 6 (1997), * Vector (1999), * Marker (2005), * Crisis (2006), * Critical (2007), * Foreign Body (2008), * Intervention (2009), * Cure (2010), * Pandemic (2018), * Genesis (2019), ==Film and television adaptations== * Coma (1977) has been adapted for both film and television: ** Coma (1978), a feature film directed by author/doctor Michael Crichton and produced by Martin Erlichmann for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ** Coma (airdates September 3\u20134, 2012) a four-hour A&E; television mini-series based on the 1977 novel and subsequent 1978 film, directed by Mikael Salomon and produced by brothers Ridley and Tony Scott * Sphinx (1979) was adapted into the feature film Sphinx (1981), directed by Franklin J.
