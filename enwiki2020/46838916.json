In 1953, it was transformed into a rural committee with representatives from 29 villages, in which Chan became the chairman for six terms. Lau Wong-fat succeeded as chairman in 1970 and served from seventh to twentieth terms until Junius Ho Kwan-yiu took over in 2011. In 2015, Lau Wong- fat retook the chairmanship from Junius Ho. In 1959, the New Territories villagers protested against the changing of land use by the government which later brought the New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Ordinance into existence. The rural committee has been member of the Heung Yee Kuk, the powerful organ voicing the interests of the villagers and its chairman Lau Wong-fat has been Chairman of the Kuk for more than twenty years.
