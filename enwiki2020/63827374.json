    "text": "ZeroZeroZero is an original soundtrack album by Scottish post-rock band Mogwai, released on 1 May 2020 on Rock Action Records. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was released initially in a download only format via Bandcamp, and for the first week on a pay-what-you-want basis. 50% of the first week's income for the record is to be donated to charities including Help Musicians and various NHS charities. The music was composed for ZeroZeroZero, an Italian crime drama television series based on the book of the same name by Roberto Saviano. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Mogwai * Stuart Braithwaite \u2013 guitar, vocals * Dominic Aitchison \u2013 bass guitar * Barry Burns \u2013 guitar, piano, synthesizer * Martin Bulloch - drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Chart performance of ZeroZeroZero ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 60 |} ==References== Category:Mogwai soundtracks Category:2020 soundtrack albums Category:Rock Action Records albums ",
