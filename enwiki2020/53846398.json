    "text": "Gareth \"Gaz\" Brookfield (born Gareth Brookfield, 4 July 1979) is a musician based in Bristol. He is usually a solo artist, playing acoustic guitar, but is regularly joined by fiddle player Ben Wain and also has a full band, the Company of Thieves. He is also followed on his expansive tours by a loyal following calling themselves \"The Land Pirates\". ==Biography== In his early career, Brookfield played with a number of bands but moved to a solo career in 2006. In 2010, he won Acoustic Magazine's Singer-Songwriter of the Year award, which also won him a place on the Big Top stage at Beautiful Days Festival, where he played twice more since. He played at other major festivals such as Glastonbury, and supported artists such as The Levellers, New Model Army, Ferocious Dog, and Frank Turner. In 2011, he became the first (and to this date only) unsigned solo act to sell out the 450-capacity Fleece in Bristol, an achievement which he has since repeated four more times with his Christmas shows; the 2014 show was also his 1,000th gig. In 2017, due to demand, the Christmas show was moved to the 750-capacity Bristol Bierkeller which sold out as well. With the closure of the Bierkeller shortly afterwards, the 2018 show was moved again, this time to the bigger SWX venue, where the 2019 show was also held. The Bristol Post, naming Brookfield in their \"60 Coolest People in Bristol\" article, said \"There aren't many musicians in Bristol who could sell out the 1,100-capacity SWX, but he does.\" ==The Company of Thieves== Brookfield plays semi-regular shows with a full band, the line-up of which is as follows; *Ben Wain (fiddle) *Nick Parker (mandolin) *Chris Webb (guitar) *Leks Wood (drums) *Jon Buckett (keyboards) *Tom Granville, (bass) ==Discography== Brookfield has released seven albums, plus three \"Solo Acoustic Guy\" albums with re-workings of his previous songs. He has also produced a number of live albums. ===Studio=== *Trial and Error (2011) *Tell It to the Beer (2012) *In The Company Of Thieves (2013) *True and Fast (2015) *I Know My Place (2016) *Lostfolk (2019) *Lockdown (2020) ===Reworkings=== *Solo Acoustic Guy (2015) *Solo Acoustic Guy II (2016) *Solo Acoustic Guy III (2017) *Aged Revolt (split with Jake Martin, covering each other's songs, 2018) ==References== ==External links== * Twitter * Facebook * BBC Music artist page Category:Living people Category:1979 births Category:English male singers Category:English singer-songwriters Category:21st-century English singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
