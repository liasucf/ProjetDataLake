    "text": "The 2018 Colorado State Senate elections took place as part of the biennial United States elections. Colorado voters elected state senators in 17 of the 35 districts in the state senate. State senators serve four-year terms in the Colorado State Senate. The Colorado Reapportionment Commission provides a statewide map of the state Senate here, and individual district maps are available from the U.S. Census here. A primary election on June 26, 2018 determined which candidates appeared on the November 6 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained from the Colorado Secretary of State's website. Following the 2016 state Senate elections, Republicans maintained effective control of the Senate with 18 members. Democratic state Senator Cheri Jahn switched from Democrat to unaffiliated on December 29, 2017. However, Sen. Jahn decided to still caucus with Democrats. In the 2018 election, Republicans defended 10 seats while Democrats defended 6 seats with Jahn's 1 Independent seat up for grabs. To claim control of the chamber from Republicans, the Democrats needed to net 1 Senate seat while electing a Democrat to the Independent seat. The Democratic candidate won the Independent seat while Democrats netted 2 additional seats, giving the party majority status in the chamber. ==Summary of Results== *Districts not shown are not up for election until 2020. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%;line-height:14px;\" !
