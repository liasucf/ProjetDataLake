    "text": "NetworkX is a Python library for studying graphs and networks. NetworkX is free software released under the BSD-new license. == Features == * Classes for graphs and digraphs. * Conversion of graphs to and from several formats. * Ability to construct random graphs or construct them incrementally. * Ability to find subgraphs, cliques, k-cores. * Explore adjacency, degree, diameter, radius, center, betweenness, etc. * Draw networks in 2D and 3D. == Suitability == NetworkX is suitable for operation on large real-world graphs: e.g., graphs in excess of 10 million nodes and 100 million edges.Aric Hagberg, Drew Conway, \"Hacking social networks using the Python programming language (Module II \u2013 Why do SNA in NetworkX)\", Sunbelt 2010: International Network for Social Network Analysis. Due to its dependence on a pure-Python \"dictionary of dictionary\" data structure, NetworkX is a reasonably efficient, very scalable, highly portable framework for network and social network analysis.Aric A.

Vaught, J. Millman (Eds.), pp. 11\u201315. == Integration == NetworkX is integrated into SageMath.http://sagemath.org/links-components.html == See also == * Social network analysis software * JGraph == References == ==External links== * Official website: * NetworkX discussion group * Survey of existing graph theory software * NetworkX on StackOverflow * Category:Free mathematics software Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:Graph drawing software Category:Numerical software Category:Software using the BSD license ",
