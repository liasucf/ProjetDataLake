    "text": "The Delta IV Heavy (Delta 9250H) is an expendable heavy-lift launch vehicle, the largest type of the Delta IV family and the world's second highest- capacity rocket in operation, behind SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. It is manufactured by United Launch Alliance and was first launched in 2004.\"Boeing Delta IV Heavy Achieves Major Test Objectives in First Flight\" , Boeing, 2004, accessed 22 March 2012. The Delta IV Heavy consists of a central Common Booster Core (CBC), with two additional CBCs as liquid rocket boosters instead of the GEM-60 solid rocket motors used by the Delta IV Medium+ versions. At lift off, all three cores operate at full thrust, and 44 seconds later the center core throttles down to 55% to conserve fuel until booster separation. The boosters burn out at 242 seconds after launch and are separated as the core booster throttles back up to full thrust. The core burns out 86 seconds later, and the second stage completes the ascent to orbit. The rocket uses three RS-68 engines, one in the central core and one in each booster. == History == Delta IV Heavy for Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), in 2014. The Delta IV line of rockets was developed by McDonnell Douglas, later United Launch Alliance. The Delta IV Heavy is the most powerful member of the line, which also includes the smaller Delta IV Medium. The Delta IV Heavy can lift 28,370 kg (62,540 lbs) to low Earth orbit and 13,810 kg (30,440 lbs) to geostationary transfer orbit. It is an all liquid-fueled rocket, consisting of an upper stage, one main booster and two strap-on boosters. The first launch of the Delta IV Heavy in 2004 carried a boilerplate payload and failed to reach intended orbit. Cavitation in the liquid-oxygen propellant lines caused shutdown of both boosters eight seconds early, and the core engine nine seconds early; this resulted in a lower staging velocity for which the second stage was unable to compensate. The payload was left in a lower than intended orbit. Its first operational payload was the DSP-23 satellite, successfully launched in 2007; it was then used to launch a further five visual and electronic reconnaissance satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office through 2013. In December 2014, the Delta IV Heavy was used to launch an uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft, designated Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1). After several delays, the mission was successfully launched at 12:05 UTC on 5 December 2014. == Capability == Capacity of the Delta IV Heavy: * Low Earth orbit (LEO), 200 km \u00d7 28.7\u00b0: * Low Earth orbit (ISS), 407 km \u00d7 51.6\u00b0: * Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO): * Geosynchronous orbit (GEO): * Lunar transfer orbit (LTO): * Mars transfer orbit: The Delta IV Heavy's total mass at launch is approximately and produce around of thrust to power the rocket skyward at liftoff. == Launch history == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Flight No. !
