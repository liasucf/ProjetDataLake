    "text": "Maurice L\u00e9vy (February 28, 1838, Ribeauvill\u00e9 - September 30, 1910, Paris) was a French engineer and member of the Institut de France. L\u00e9vy was born in Ribeauvill\u00e9 in Alsace. Educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he was a student of Adh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant,Osakada K., p.24 and the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es, he became an engineer in 1863. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), he was entrusted by the Government of National Defense with the control of part of the artillery. During the next decade he held several educational positions, becoming professor at the \u00c9cole Centrale in 1875, member of the commission of the geodetic survey of France in 1879, and professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1885. ==Total strain theory== L\u00e9vy changed the assumption, \"the directions of principal strains coincide with those of the principal stresses\", stated by Saint-Venant, to \"the directions of increments of principal strains coincide with those of the principal stresses\" and that was also the first attempt of using an incremental flow rule. In 1888 L\u00e9vy inaugurated a system of boat-traction by means of overhead cables. A trial system was installed between Joinville-le- Pont and Saint-Maurice; it consisted of an endless cable which was kept in motion by powerful steam-engines and to which boats were attached and thus kept at a speed of four kilometers an hour. The system proved unsatisfactory, however. == Selected works == L\u00e9vy is the author of several works, including: * \"La Statique Graphique et Ses Applications \u00e0 l'Art des Constructions\" (1874; 2d ed. 1887); * \"Sur le Principe d'\u00c9nergie\" (1888); * \"\u00c9tude des Moyens de Traction des Bateaux: Le Halage Funiculaire\" (with M. G. Pavie, 1894) L\u00e9vy also wrote papers on kinematics, mechanics, physical mathematics, geometry, etc., in the \"Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\", the \"Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique\", and the \"Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es\". L\u00e9vy was an officer of the Legion of Honor and of public instruction, and a member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Rome. ==Notes== == References == * Article, by Isidore Singer & Victor Rousseau Emanuel * C.
