In the , Mount Mee had a population of 484 people. ==Geography== Mount Mee is a mountain, located north of the town of Dayboro in the D'Aguilar Range. ==History== The area around Mount Mee was known to the indigenous inhabitants of the area as Dahmongah, a word meaning \"flying squirrel\" or glider. The English name Mount Mee is possibly derived from another local word mia-mia, meaning a view or lookout, but this name was not formalised until the establishment of the school in 1899. Settlers began arriving in the area around Mount Mee in 1873, many being timber-getters attracted by the red cedar timber that was readily available in the area. Initially, timber cut down in the area was exported to the nearby towns of Caboolture, D'Aguilar and Woodford, but a sawmill was eventually built in the fledgling town. A number of larger mills were operated on various parts of the mountain until the last closed in 1982. Dahmongah Provisional School opened on 20 February 1884. In 1900 it was renamed Mount Mee Provisional School. It closed in 1904 due to low student numbers but opened again in 1909. On 1 October 1909 it became Mount Mee State School. Mount Mee Methodist Church was consecrated on 16 December 1922. As at 2020, it is a community church which can be used for any Christian purpose. Mount Mee Public Hall opened in 1933. A special tractor called the Linn tractor was used to haul logs instead of bullock teams in the early 1930s. Over time, agriculture became important to the economy of the area, with dairy farms and banana plantations being particularly important. Mount Mee Banana Settlement State School opened on 4 April 1934 and closed circa 1939. Mount Mee was initially governed as a part of the Caboolture Divisional Board, but was rolled into the new Moreton Bay Region when that entity was amalgamated with Pine Rivers Shire and Redcliffe City in 2008. ==Demographics== In the , Mount Mee recorded a population of 484 people, 49.9% female and 50.1% male.
