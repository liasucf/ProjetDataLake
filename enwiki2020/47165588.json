On All About Jazz Joshua Weiner wrote \"The almost psychic interplay here between Giuffre and Hall is typical of the 3, but Brown is a real surprise. He sounds glad to be liberated from the relative stricture of Oscar Peterson's trio, fitting seamlessly into Giuffre's conception while still providing a strong, swinging pulse\".Weiner, J., All About Jazz Review, October 14, 2003 == Track listing == All compositions by Jimmy Giuffre unless noted. # \"The Easy Way\" \u2013 5:56 # \"Mack the Knife\" (Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht) \u2013 4:54 # \"Come Rain or Come Shine\" (Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer) \u2013 4:32 # \"Careful\" (Jim Hall) \u2013 6:30 # \"Ray's Time\" \u2013 7:00 # \"A Dream\" \u2013 2:09 # \"Off Center\" \u2013 4:41 # \"Montage\" \u2013 1:51 # \"Time Enough\" \u2013 2:41 == Personnel == *Jimmy Giuffre \u2013 clarinet, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone *Jim Hall \u2013 guitar *Ray Brown \u2013 bass == References == Category:Jimmy Giuffre albums Category:1959 albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
