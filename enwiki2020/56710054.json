Faced with the choice between school and music, he left his home village and fled to Thessaloniki. He became a self taught musician. By the 90s he was working as an arranger, ensemble director and producer on studio recordings. Alternating between touring abroad, he joined the group Savina Yannatou & Primavera en Salonico in 2001, with four albums released by ECM; from 2002 to 2005 he taught at the Technical Education Institute of Epirus and the University of Macedonia. Later, under the fictional auspices of \u2018no bizz productions\u2019, he became the pivot, and inspiration, of \u201cninety nine (99)\u201d, improvised public rehearsal performances in a small underground theatre in Thessaloniki from 2005 to 2011 involving onstage encounters between Doneff and musicians, dancers, actors, poets and visual artists. Interludes of composing for the theatre and silver screen were interspersed with forays into theatre direction and, under the name of Tome Rapovina, directing and editing short films. From 2014 to 2016, he worked as a composer and actor with the Kammerpiele in Munich and the Thalia Theater in Hamburg. As a result of his appearance as an ECM artist, Dine Doneff together with painter & photographer Fotini Potamia, founded the label \u201cneRED music\u201d following a suggestion of Manfred Eicher, ECM\u2019s founder and producer.
