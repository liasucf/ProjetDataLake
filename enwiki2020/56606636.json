However, the price for the car high. The standard car cost 46,500 CSK in 1935, while the aerodynamic sedan was even more expensive at 46,500 CSK. The standard price was reduced to 40,800 CSK in summer 1936 and production ceased before the end of the year. ==References== Category:Cars introduced in 1934 Category:Cars of the Czech Republic Category:Praga vehicles ",
