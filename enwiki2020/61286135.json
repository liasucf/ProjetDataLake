The competition was contested by 64 clubs split geographically across 4 groups of 16 teams each. The teams included amateur clubs (although a few are semi-professional) and the reserve teams of professional clubs. The season was suspended indefinitely on 12 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 16 April 2020, the FFF announced the termination of the competition, with promotion and relegation decided by points earned per game played, subject to the normal verification process by the financial authority, the DNCG. ==Teams== On 16 July, the FFF ratified the constitution of the competition, and published the groups as follows: * 46 clubs who were neither relegated or promoted from the 2018\u201319 Championnat National 2 groups. * 3 teams relegated from 2018\u201319 Championnat National (Drancy, L'Entente SSG, Marignane Gignac). * 12 teams promoted from 2018\u201319 Championnat National 3. (Angoul\u00eame, Angers (res), Bourges Foot, SC Bastia, Louhans-Cuiseaux, Mulhouse, Montpellier (res), Saint-Quentin, Rouen, Guingamp (res), Gobelins and Chamali\u00e8res). * 3 teams reprieved from relegation from the 2018\u201319 Championnat National 2 groups (Haguenau, N\u00eemes(res), Monaco (res)). ==League tables== ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ==Top scorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Goals |- |1 |align=left| Geoffray Durbant |align=left|Sedan |15 |- |2 |align=left| Pythocles Bazolo |align=left|Bobigny |14 |- |rowspan=3|3 |align=left| Kevin Farade |align=left|Bobigny |rowspan=3|13 |- |align=left| Nigel Solvet |align=left|Haguenau |- |align=left| Jordan Popineau |align=left|Blois |- |6 |align=left| Marvyn Belliard |align=left|Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve |12 |- |rowspan=2|7 |align=left| K\u00e9vin Cardinali |align=left|Colomiers |rowspan=2|11 |- |align=left| Samy Alouache |align=left|Moulins-Yzeure |- |9 |align=left| Daouda Gueye |align=left|Bourges Foot |10 |- |rowspan=3|10 |align=left| Louis Mafouta |align=left|Grasse |rowspan=3|9 |- |align=left| S\u00e9bastien Persico |align=left|Chartres |- |align=left| Mamadou Niang |align=left|Saint-Quentin |} ==Season outcomes== ===Promotion=== SC Bastia, Saint-Brieuc, S\u00e8te and Annecy were champions of each group, and are promoted to 2020\u201321 Championnat National, subject to the usual ratification by the FFF and DNCG. ===Relegation=== Croix, Drancy, Lille (res), Mantes, Oissel, Vitr\u00e9, Montpellier (res), Stade Bordelais, Saint- \u00c9tienne (res), Saint-Priest, Endoume Marseille and N\u00eemes (res) finished in the relegation places, and are relegated to 2020\u201321 Championnat National 3, subject to any reprieves detailed in the next section. On 16 June 2020 Mulhouse were administrative relegated by the DNCG committee of the FFF. The relegation was confirmed on appeal. ===Reprieves=== Any reprieves required due to administrative relegations, mergers or clubs folding are usually decided by taking, in order, the 14th placed clubs ranked by order of their record against clubs finishing 9th to 13th position in their group, followed by the 15th placed clubs ranked by order of their record against clubs finishing in 10th to 14th position in their group. Due to the season not being completed, this ranking used points per game rather than points earned. Saint-Priest were reprieved due to the administrative relegation of Mulhouse, subject to that club appealing the decision. ====Best 14th placed team==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=20 | !width=165 |Team !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=200 | |-bgcolor=#ccffcc |1||align=left|Saint- Priest ||1.83||6|| Reprieved |- |2||align=left|Lille (res)||1.5||1|| |- |3||align=left|Vitr\u00e9||1.14||0|| |- |4||align=left|Montpellier (res)||1.12||-5|| |} ====Best 15th placed team==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=20 | !width=165 |Team !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=200 | |- |1||align=left|Saint-\u00c9tienne (res)||1.6||0|| |- |2||align=left|Drancy||1.43||2|| |- |3||align=left|Marseille Endoume||1.16||0|| |- |4||align=left|Oissel||0.33||-14|| |} ==References== 2019-20 4 Fra France ",
