Australia at The Oval (only Test of the season). Australia won the most famous match in history by 7 runs with F R Spofforth, the original \"Demon Bowler\", taking seven for 46 and seven for 44. Soon afterwards, The Sporting Times printed its legendary obituary notice: The death notice which first named the Ashes :In Affectionate Remembrance :of :ENGLISH CRICKET, :which died at the Oval :on :29th AUGUST, 1882, :Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing :friends and acquaintances :---- :R.I.P. :---- :N.B.--The body will be cremated and the :ashes taken to Australia. * 25 September: Ted Peate breaks the late James Southerton\u2019s 1870 record by taking his 211st wicket of the season. His record stands until Charles Turner takes his 215th wicket on 23 August 1888. Further details can be found in the articles History of Test cricket (to 1883) and The Ashes. ==Notes== An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1883 * James Lillywhite's Cricketers\u2019 Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1883 *John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1883 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1882 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
