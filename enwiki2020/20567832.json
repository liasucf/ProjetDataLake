    "text": "Valaji or Valachi is a r\u0101gam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music). It is a pentatonic scale (audava or owdava r\u0101gam, which means \"of 5\"). It is a janya r\u0101gam (derived scale), as it does not have all the seven swaras (musical notes). The equivalent of Valaji in Hindustani music is Kal\u0101vati.Ragas in Carnatic music by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH PublicationsRaganidhi by P. Subba Rao, Pub. 1964, The Music Academy of Madras == Structure and Lakshana == Valaji scale with shadjam at C Valaji is a symmetric r\u0101gam that does not contain rishabham or madhyamam. It is a pentatonic scale (audava-audava r\u0101gam in Carnatic music classification). Its ' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms): * : * : (the notes used in this scale are shadjam, antara gandharam, panchamam, chathusruthi dhaivatham and kaisiki nishadam) Valaji is considered a janya r\u0101gam of Chakravakam, the 16th Melakarta r\u0101gam, though it can be derived from other melakarta r\u0101gams, Harikambhoji, Vagadheeswari, Ramapriya, Vachaspati or Nasikabhooshani, by dropping both rishabham and madhyamam. Since Chakravakam is lowest in ordinal number among these 6 melakarta scales, Valaji is associated with it. == Popular compositions == Valaji is a pleasing scale, but has only a few compositions in classical music. It has been used to score film music as well. Here are some popular kritis composed in Valaji. *Jalandhara supithasthe japa kusuma bhasure by Muthiah Bhagavatar *Santatam Ninne by G. N. Balasubramaniam *Sri Gayatri, by Saint Gnanananda Tirtha( Sri Ogirala Veera Raghava Sarma) *T\u00e2ndava Priy\u00e2 by Kalyani Varadarajan == Related r\u0101gams == This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this r\u0101gam. === Graha bhedam === Valaji's notes when shifted using Graha bhedam, yields another pentatonic r\u0101gam Abhogi. Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same, while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the r\u0101gam. For more details and illustration of this concept refer Graha bhedam on Abhogi. === Scale similarities === *Malayamarutam is a r\u0101gam which has shuddha rishabham in both ascending and descending scales in addition to the notes in Valaji. Its ' structure is : *Nagasvaravali is a r\u0101gam which has the shuddha madhyamam in place of the nishadam. Its ' structure is : *Mohanam is a r\u0101gam which has the chathusruti rishabham in place of the nishadam.
