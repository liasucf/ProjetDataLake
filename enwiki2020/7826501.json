Paternoster Row was described as \"almost synonymous\" with the book trade. It was part of an area also called St Paul's Churchyard. The street was devastated by aerial bombardment during the World War II. In 2003 the street was replaced with Paternoster Square, the modern home of the London Stock Exchange, although a City of London Corporation road sign remains in the square near where Paternoster Row once stood. ==Name== The street is supposed to have received its name from the fact that, when the monks and clergy of St Paul's Cathedral would go in procession chanting the great litany, they would recite the Lord's Prayer (Pater Noster being its opening line in Latin) in the litany along this part of the route). The prayers said at these processions may have also given the names to nearby Ave Maria Lane and Amen Corner. An alternative etymology is the early traders, who sold a type of prayer been known as a \"pater noster\". ==History== The name of the street dates back at least to the 16th century. Houses in St. Paul's Churchyard were damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666, burning down the old St. Paul's Cathedral. When the new St. Paul's Cathedral was erected, booksellers returned after a number of years. Gentleman Henry (Robert) Gunnell, Esq. (1724\u20131794) of Millbank, a senior officer in the House of Commons and House of Lords who worked the Tax Acts for the American Colonies with Prime Minister George Grenville and also Lord North, bought No.8 Paternoster Row in 1778 as one of his portfolio of properties and soon after gave it to his eldest son John Gunnell (1750\u20131796), a Westminster gentleman. John though seldom stayed at the house, as he lived mainly at Margate, Kent, and it was instead used as a literary venue by his father Henry (Robert) and his friends, where among other notable members, Jane Timbury would attend. Her stance as a novelist and poet later inspired Jane Austen in her career. Henry (Robert) Gunnell's wife Anne Rozea (1727\u20131795) of Duke's Court, St.Martin's Lane (situated where now the National Gallery cafe is positioned) was known for her attendance, reciting moving French poetry dressed in an exquisite mantua with ornate jubilee hat. Johann Christian Bach (1735\u20131782) was also known to have attended on occasions. Henry (Robert) had bought No.8 Paternoster Row from Philanthropist Sylvanus Hall, a successful London currier and leather goods craftsman (Guildhall Library) and also governor of both St.Thomas and Bridewell Hospitals, who owned two other houses on Paternoster Row and had earlier worked with Anne Rozea at \"Gunnell\u2019s Hat Warehouse\" at No.54 Chandois Street (next door to the Mercers Coventry Cross), Covent Garden, from the mid 1760s. There he oversaw the manufacture of fashionable hats, cloaks and silk garments and later married Henry (Robert) Gunnell and Anne Rozea's daughter, Ann Gunnell (1746\u20131804), at the church of St.Augustine, Watling Street, 02.Feb.1769 just east of St.Paul's cathedral. They lived at No.8 Paternoster Row for nine years, until her father bought it for his son John as part of his inheritance as mentioned in 1778. Ann and Sylvanus Hall then moved to a house on Golden Square, Soho. On the 21.Feb.1776, at the Old Bailey, Jeremiah Pope was indicted for stealing \u2018six hundred pounds weight of lead piping\u2019 from the three properties (Nos. 8, 9, and 10) of Sylvanus Hall on Paternoster Row. Another well-known visitor to No.8 was Thomas Vanhagen, whose famous pastry shop was located beside Pauls Alley, St Paul\u2019s Churchyard, facing the North Entrance and where many Londoners took their refreshment. Various caricatures of Vanhagen (British Museum) were published over the years. His daughter Charlotte married Henry (Robert) and Anne\u2019s son Henry Gunnell (1754-1823), also of the House of Commons, 10.July.1779 at the parish of St.Gregory by St.Paul's. The Gunnells eventually sold No.8 Paternoster Row in 1794. A bust of Aldus Manutius, writer and publisher, can be seen above the fascia of number 13. The bust was placed there in 1820 by Bible publisher Samuel Bagster. It was reported that Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Anne Bront\u00eb stayed at the Chapter Coffeehouse on the street when visiting London in 1847. They were in the city to meet their publisher regarding Jane Eyre. A fire broke out at number 20 Paternoster Row on 6 February 1890. Occupied by music publisher Fredrick Pitman, the first floor was found to be on fire by a police officer at 21:30. The fire alarm was sounded at St. Martin's-le-Grand and fire crews extinguished the flames in half an hour. The floor was badly damaged, with smoke, heat and water impacting the rest of the building. This blaze was followed later the same year on 5 October by 'an alarming fire'. At 00:30 a fire was discovered at W. Hawtin and Sons, based in numbers 24 and 25. The wholesale stationers' warehouse was badly damaged by the blaze. On 21 November 1894, police raided an alleged gambling club which was based on the first floor of 59 Paternoster Row. The club known both as the 'City Billiard Club' and the 'Junior Gresham Club' had been there barely three weeks at the time of the raid. Forty-five arrests were made, including club owner Albert Cohen. On 4 November 1939, a large-scale civil defence exercise was held in the City of London. One of the simulated seats of fire was in Paternoster Row. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. was one of the publishing companies on Paternoster Row. ==Destruction during World War II== The street was devastated by aerial bombardment during the Blitz of World War II, suffering particularly heavy damage in the night raid of 29\u201330 December 1940, later characterised as the Second Great Fire of London, during which an estimated 5 million books were lost in the fires caused by tens of thousands of incendiary bombs. After the raid a letter was written to The Times describing: Another correspondent with the newspaper, Ernest W. Larby, described his experience of 25 years working on Paternoster Row: The ruins of Paternoster Row were visited by Wendell Willkie in January 1941. He said, \"I thought that the burning of Paternoster Row, the street where the books are published, was rather symbolic. They [the Germans] have destroyed the place where the truth is told\". ==Printers and booksellers based in Paternoster Row== The Globe' Note: Before about 1762, premises in London had signs rather than numbers. * The Tyger's Head \u2013 Christopher Barker (????), his son Robert Barker (1545\u20131629)A Dictionary of Printers and Printing. * The Star \u2013 Henry Denham (1564) * The Brazen Serpent (1627\u20131650) \u2013 Robert Dawlman (1627\u20131635, 1635\u20131638, died 1659), Luke Fawne (1635\u20131638, 1639\u20131641), Samuel Gellibrand (1639\u20131641, 1641\u20131650) * The Golden Ball/Ball (1650\u20131675) \u2013 Samuel Gellibrand (1654, 1655, 1656, 1661, 1667, 1669, 1673) (died 1675), two of his sons Edward Gellibrand (1676, 1678, 1679, 1680, 1681, 1685), John Gellibrand (1679\u20131685), F.?
