He was also Count of \u00c1lava and had under his personal control part of the County of Castile. As the eldest son of Sancho III he inherited the dynastic rights over the crown of Pamplona, becoming feudal overlord over two of his brothers: Ramiro, who was given lands that would serve as the basis for the Kingdom of Arag\u00f3n; and Gonzalo, who received the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. Likewise, he had some claim to suzerainty over his brother Ferdinand, who under their father had served as Count of Castile, nominally subject to the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n but brought under the personal control of Sancho III. ==Biography== Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez inherited the crown of Pamplona after the death of his father Sancho III in 1035, bypassing the late king's eldest son Ramiro, who was illegitimate. In 1043 he defeated his half-brother in battle, setting the eastern border of the kingdom. Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III took advantage of the weakened state of the numerous Islamic taifa kingdoms that arose after the dissolution of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba to push the southern border over their territory, taking the city of Calahorra in 1045. He also inherited from his father the County of \u00c1lava and a great part of the County of Castile (La Bureba, Trasmiera, Montes de Oca, the Encartaciones and Las Merindades). In the year 1037 he joins his brother Ferdinand, the nominal Count of Castile, in a battle against the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n that took place near the river Pisuerga and that came to be known as Battle of Tamar\u00f3n. Bermudo III, King of Le\u00f3n, was defeated and killed in battle, ending a dynasty of monarchs that went back to Peter of Cantabria. Ferdinand would then be crowned King of Le\u00f3n.Bernard F. Reilly, The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain 1031\u20131157, (Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1995), 27. The relationship between the two brothers would however turn sour by the conflictive distribution of the lands of Castile between Le\u00f3n and Pamplona, leading to the Battle of Atapuerca, where Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez would perish.Joseph F. O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, (Cornell University Press, 1975), 195. ==Marriage and family== Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III married Stephanie of Foix in Barcelona in 1038. Stephanie was the youngest daughter of Bernard-Roger, Count of BigorreSalazar y Acha agrees with the opinion of Languedoc historians who held that she was the daughter of Bernard-Roger, Count of Bigorre and his wife Gersenda, explaining Stephanie's presence in Barcelona as a lady in the court of her maternal aunt Ermesinde of Carcassonne married to Ramon Borrell, count of Barcelona. They had nine children: * Sancho Garc\u00e9s, nicknamed Sancho the Noble, who became King of Pamplona and ruled as Sancho IV from 1054 until his death in 1076. He married Placencia of Normandy. * Urraca Garc\u00e9s, married in 1074 to Garc\u00eda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, lord of N\u00e1jera and Gra\u00f1\u00f3n. * Ermesinda Garc\u00e9s, married to Fort\u00fan S\u00e1nchez, lord of Y\u00e9queda. * Ramiro Garc\u00e9s, lord of Calahorra. * Fernando Garc\u00e9s, lord of Bucesta, Jubera, Lagunilla and Oprela. * Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00e9s, lord of Murillo and Agoncillo. Ram\u00f3n became known as the fratricidal, after he murdered his brother and King Sancho IV. Afterwards he escaped to the Taifa of Zaragoza. In an 1134 charter, Marquesa, wife of Aznar L\u00f3pez, referred to her grandfather \"rex Raymundi\" (literally 'king' Ram\u00f3n). However, in medieval Navarre there are examples of the term being used by infantes, so this need not signify he claimed the throne on his brother's death.Besga Marroqu\u00edn, Armando (2011). \"El reparto del Reino de Pamplona del a\u00f1o 1076\". Alfonso VI Imperator, totius orbis Hispanie. Fernando Su\u00e1rez and Andr\u00e9s Gambra, coord. (Madrid: Sanz y Torres) pp. 51-91. . * Jimena Garc\u00e9s, lady of Corcuetos, Hornos de Moncalvillo and Daroca.Appears for the last time on 27 May 1085 at the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real of Najera confirming a donation made by her brother Ramiro. * Mayor Garc\u00e9s, lady of Yanguas. * Sancha Garc\u00e9s Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez had two illegitimate children by unknown women: * Sancho Garc\u00e9s, lord of Uncastillo, married to Constanza. His son, Ramiro S\u00e1nchez would be the father of Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, who became King of Pamplona. * Menc\u00eda Garc\u00e9s, married to Fort\u00fan Ochoiz, lord of Cameros. ==Ancestry== ==Notes== ==Sources== * *Salazar y Acha, Jaime de (1992). \"Reflexiones sobre la posible historicidad de un episodio de la Cr\u00f3nica Najarense\".
