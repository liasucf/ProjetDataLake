The station broadcasts a country music format using the on-air brand name as Country 105. ==History== The station was launched in 1944 as CFPA at 1230 kHz, an AM Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network station owned by local businessman Ralph Parker. When the Dominion Network dissolved in 1962, CFPA transferred its affiliation to the main CBC Radio network. It ceased airing CBC programming in 1972, adopting a country music format. In 1980, the station was purchased by Leader Broadcasting and adopted the call sign CJLB. In 1988, the station was acquired by Newcap Broadcasting. In 1986, CJLB received CRTC approval to add a low-power FM transmitter in Nipigon/Red Rock, Ontario on 96.3 MHz to rebroadcast the programs of CJLB Thunder Bay. CJLB applied to move Nipigon's frequency to 96.1 MHz, and it is uncertain if this was ever implemented.Decision CRTC 86-1137 In 1995, Newcap entered a local marketing agreement with Dougall Media, giving Dougall the right to manage the station. On November 2, 1994, CJLB was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to convert to FM.CRTC Decision 94-842. In 1996, the station moved to 105.3 MHz. In 2002, CJLB-FM dropped its KIXX 105 country music format and adopted a hot adult contemporary/CHR format as Hot 105. In 2004, Dougall terminated the LMA when Newcap applied to purchase CJUK. Newcap changed CJLB's callsign to its current CKTG calls and adopted its current classic rock format as 105.3 The Giant in early 2005. In mid-2005, CFQK-FM in Kaministiquia, Ontario, located near Thunder Bay which had no affiliation with CKTG dropped their \"Larry FM\" variety hits format to Hot AC/CHR as HOT FM.
