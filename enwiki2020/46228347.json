    "text": "The 50's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 is a restaurant at Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of the four main theme parks at Walt Disney World.O'Halloran (2007), p. 189. The restaurant replicates the kitsch of a 1950s diner.Gindin & Greenhill-Taylor (2011), p. 19. The waitresses dress similarly to Leave It to Beaver character June Cleaver, and each acts as though she is the mother of the guests she is serving, to the point of scolding and giving (mild) discipline to the patrons if they are \"misbehaving\" (similar to the concept of themed restaurants such as Ed Debevic's (a 1950s-themed diner in Chicago) and Dick's Last Resort, where the servers are specifically trained to be obnoxious).Wiley & Jenkins (2012), p. 327. While eating, guests watch 1950s television shows such as Leave It to Beaver and Topper on black-and-white televisions.Goldsbury (2010), p. 313. Menu items include chicken pot pie, pot roast, fried chicken, meatloaf, and milkshakes.Lafray (2005), p. 60. The 50's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 opened in 1989. Two years later, another theme restaurant opened at the park: the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant; the 50's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 had garnered much success, and Disney hoped that another restaurant that had a strong emphasis on theme would have a similar level of success. The Sci-Fi Dine-In initially received little interest, but, within five weeks of opening, it was serving between 1,500 and 2,000 meals on a daily basis, just as the 50's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 was doing. These restaurants are two of the four in the park that offer table service, the others being the Hollywood Brown Derby and Mama Melrose's Ristorante Italiano.Shumaker (2003), p. 77. In the book Walt Disney World Resort: Also Includes Seaworld and Central Florida, Corey Sandler writes that the 50's Prime Time Caf\u00e9 ties with the Beaches and Cream Soda Shop at Disney's Beach Club Resort for the best milkshakes in Walt Disney World.Sandler (2007), p. 46. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * Category:Disney's Hollywood Studios Category:Walt Disney World restaurants Category:1950s in American television Category:1989 establishments in Florida Category:Restaurants established in 1989 Category:Retro style Category:Nostalgia in the United States Category:American cuisine ",
