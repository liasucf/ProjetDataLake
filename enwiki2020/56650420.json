    "text": "Phantom Brickworks is the ninth studio album by English producer Stephen Wilkinson, known by his stage name Bibio. Released on 3 November 2017, it's his sixth album for Warp Records and his first entirely ambient record. The album is a set of improvised compositions consisting of simple piano, synth, and guitar loops surrounded by tape hiss and field recordings. Making the songs based on the concept that \"places can be haunted by meaning,\" Wilkinson mentally went into both real and fantasy places when producing the tracks. The album was well-received by reviewers, who called it Bibio's most accomplished record, and landed at number 11 on Time Out New York's list of the best albums of 2017. ==Concept== a chapel demolished in 1991 (pictured in 2014). The pieces on Phantom Brickworks gave Wilkinson \"a mental portal into\" real and imagined settings.\"Listen to \u2018Phantom Brickworks III\u2019\". Warp Records Official Website. 19 September 2017. Retrieved 19 February 2018. He made the LP based on the concept that \"places can be haunted by meaning,\" reasoning, \"human beings are highly sensitive to the atmospheres of places, which can be enhanced or dramatically altered when you learn about the context of their history.\" The songs are very similar to electronic voice phenomena recordings in their attempt to record sounds of ghostly activity. Most of the song titles are references to parts of the United Kingdom, such as the track named after Capel Celyn, a community in Gwynedd, Wales that was intentionally flooded to create a reservoir in 1965, and \"Capel Bethania,\" a song named after a chapel demolished in 1991. ==Production and composition== While elements of ambient music have been included in all of Bibio's records, Phantom Brickworks is his first entirely ambient release. The album is a set of improvised, slow-tempo minimal ambient electronic compositions that were written and recorded in more than ten years using only a microphone and loop pedal.Murray, Robin (1 October 2017). \"Phantom Conversations: Clash Meets Bibio\".

Time Out New York. 11 December 2017. Retrieved 20 February 2018. Sam Walker-Smart analyzed the sounds \"constantly weave in and out of the mix, drifting by as if in a dream.\" Phantom Brickworks has a very spacious structure that uses lots of reverberation, delay, and elements of long sustain in the composition: XLR8R analyzed it has a \"widescreen vibe,\" where the tracks have \"patient, sometimes nearly imperceptible cycles of accretion and subsidence\" and, as a result, \"feel as much like landscapes as they do music.\" On each track, hazy filtering, field recordings, and tape hiss are present to either drown out or undermine the importance of the main loop.Cook, Fred (7 November 2017). \"Bibio \u2018Phantom Brickworks\u2019\". Gigsoup. Retrieved 20 February 2018. As Clash magazine noted, \"the material on Phantom Brickworks writes its own rules [of ambient music] as it progresses, with Bibio uncovering fresh techniques simply through the act of performance.\" Writer Phillippa Nicole Barr states that in achieving a haunting vibe, the music's rhythmic structure follows a sort-of offbeat pattern that \"conveys that sense of the uncanny \u2013 slowing the listener down to a meditative state, so that they can begin to imagine the many phantoms all around them.\" ==Release and promotion== \"Phantom Brickworks III\" and \"Capel Celyn\" were released on 19 September 2017 and 25 October 2017\"Listen to \u2018Capel Celyn\u2019, New album \u2018Phantom Brickworks\u2019 out 3 November\".
