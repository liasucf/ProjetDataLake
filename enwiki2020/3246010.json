    "text": "HD 196885 is a binary star system in the northern constellation of Delphinus. It is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 6.39. According to its parallax of , it is located at a distance of 112 light years from the Sun. It is drifting closer with a radial velocity of \u221230 km/s, and is expected to come to within in 836,000 years. The absolute magnitude of the system is 3.76. The primary, component A, is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F8V It is about two billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity, for a rotation period of around 15 days. The star has 1.33 times the mass of the Sun and 1.45 times the Sun's radius. The metallicity of this star \u2013 what astronomers term the abundance of elements with higher atomic number than helium \u2013 is nearly double that in the Sun. It is radiating 2.7 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,340 K. In 2004, a planet was announced to be orbiting the star in a 386-day orbit. Follow-up work published in 2008 did not confirm the original candidate but instead found evidence of a planet in a . This object has a minimum estimated mass at least three times that of the planet Jupiter. Perturbation by the secondary star in this system may have driven the planet into a high inclination orbit. The secondary, component B, is a red dwarf star separated by 0.7 arcseconds from the primary star. At a distance of 112 light years, this corresponds to a separation of 24 AU between the stars. Since the separation along the line-of-sight is unknown, this represents a lower limit on the true separation. The orbital elements of the pair give an orbital period of 72 years, a semimajor axis of , and an eccentricity of 0.42. It has a class in the range M1V to M3V with 45% of the Sun's mass. The star BD+10 4351B, located 192 arcseconds away from HD 196885 is located at the same distance and may be a physically bound companion star, in which case HD 196885 is a triple system. If it is bound, then the separation is at least 6,600 AU (the separation along the line-of-sight is unknown, so this value represents a lower limit on the true separation). ==See also== *Epsilon Reticuli *GJ 3021 ==References== Category:F-type main-sequence stars Category:M-type main- sequence stars Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet Category:Binary stars Category:Delphinus (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects 196885 101966 7907 ",
