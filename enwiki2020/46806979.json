    "text": "The office of Vice President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia existed from April 1963 to June 1967. It was established by the new Yugoslav Constitution adopted on 7 April 1963. The first to serve in the role was Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107 who assumed office on 30 June 1963. Due to an affair involving wire-tapping of Yugoslav president and general secretary of the League of Communists Josip Broz Tito, Rankovi\u0107 was forced to resign from the Central Committee and from the vice presidency on 1 July 1966. He was subsequently replaced by Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107 two weeks later who served out the remainder of Rankovi\u0107's four-year term. On 26 April 1967 new amendments to the 1963 constitution were approved which disestablished the vice presidency once Rankovi\u0107 and Popovi\u0107's combined four-year term was up. The office ceased to exist on 30 June 1967. ==List of vice presidents== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! ! Picture ! Name (Born\u2013Died) ! colspan=\"2\"| Term of Office !
