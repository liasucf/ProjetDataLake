Alt URL It serves as a prequel to Fathishandhuvaru (1997) which starred Reeko Moosa Manik and Niuma Mohamed in lead roles. It also celebrates the first 3D Maldivian film released in the cinema. == Cast == * Yoosuf Shafeeu as Jinaa * Fathimath Fareela as Niha * Ahmed Nimal as Naseem * Ahmed Saeed as Shareef * Mohamed Faisal as Saleem ==Development== Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun 3D was based on a story published by Ibrahim Waheed on an online news platform Haveeru Daily. Titled Jinaa: Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun (2009), the story serves as prequel to the story Fathishandhuvaru (1996) written by Waheed which was later adapted to a film by same name in 1997. The film was marketed as being the first 3D release for a Maldivian film and the first release derived from spin-off. It was also hyped as the most awaited release of the year. It was made on a budget of MVR 1,300,000. Alt URL ==Release and response== Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun 3D was initially slated to release on 28 September 2012, however, shifted for an early 2013 release due to the unavailability of cinema. The dates further fluctuated before being finalised for 5 April 2013 release, due to the ongoing upgrading work of cinema. Upon release the film received generally negative reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem from Haveeru Daily criticised the screenplay for the lack of \"amusement\" and the \"abrupt rush\" in story-line with \"flaws in the script\". He further deprecate the acting of the cast; \"Not only Yoosuf Shafeeu, everyone in the cast gave a forgettable performance barring Ahmed Nimal. He concluded the review praising the efforts put into visual effect and addressing the \"dislike of the film in comparison to Fathis Handhuvaru\". Fathimath Zaina from Vnews echoed similar sentiments and mentioned: \"It brings a good opportunity for Maldivians to experience a Dhivehi film in 3D, however it is a disappointment as a film overall. It does not bring justice to the genre it represent and so does the same to the story it's based on\". Ibrahim Waheed, who originally penned the story, disapproved the film; \"The story proceeded with no pace, the film moved unnoticed, bass sound was so high you do not hear the dialogues well, direction extremely weak\". ==Soundtrack== ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Award !scope=\"col\"| Category !scope=\"col\"| Recipients !scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"22\" | 7th Gaumee Film Awards | Best film | Fathis Handhuvaruge Feshun 3D | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Director | Ali Shifau | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Actor | Yoosuf Shafeeu | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Actress | Fathimath Fareela | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Original Song | rowspan=\"3\"| Shifa Thaufeeq | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Best Female Playback Singer | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | |style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Best Editing | Ali Shifau | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Cinematography | Ibrahim Visan | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Screenplay | Ibrahim Waheed | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Sound Mixing | rowspan=\"2\"| Ali Shifau | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Sound Editing | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Makeup | Hassan Adam | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Visual Effects | Ahmed Sinan | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |} ==References== Category:2013 films Category:Maldivian films Category:Dark Rain Entertainment films Category:2013 horror films Category:Maldivian horror films ",
