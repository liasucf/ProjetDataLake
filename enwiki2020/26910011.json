She was listed incorrectly among the stewardesses. Also, a female presidential aide, Zofia Kruszy\u0144ska-Gust, was supposed to fly but did not do so due to illness. Additionally, Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, was invited but did not board the flight due to its conflict with the Jewish Sabbath, which prohibits flight on Saturday. ==References== ==External links== * Federacja Rodzin Katy\u0144skich * National Katyn Memorial Foundation * Text of President Kaczynski's planned speech commemorating Victims of the Katyn Forest Massacre Category:Lists of Polish people * casualties ",
