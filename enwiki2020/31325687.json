The party emerged from a split in the Syrian Communist Party in 1986, formed by the pro-Perestroika faction led by Yusuf Faisal. At the time of the 2000 Damascus Spring, the party was able to publish a newspaper called an-Nour (\"The Light\"). The 11th party congress, held in March 2011, re-elected Hanin Nimir as First Secretary of the party. == Electoral results == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ People's Council of Syria ! Election year !
