    "text": "The Music of Dolphins, by Karen Hesse, is a children's book that follows the story of Mila, a feral child raised by a pod of dolphins around the Florida Keys and Caribbean. \"Mila\" is an abbreviated form of the Spanish word milagro, meaning \"miracle\". The novel uses a narrative structure that parallels Mila's increasing comprehension of the English language. At the novel's opening, when Mila is with the dolphins and cannot speak English , also cannot recognise who she is. The text moves to simple English as Mila learns the language, becomes more complex as her emotions increase, reverts to simple English when she yearns for the dolphins and, finally, goes back to third person. Although the novel is fiction, it is based on real life experiences of people who have worked with feral children. ==Summary== Mila, a girl raised by dolphins, is discovered and captured on a cay and taken to a scientific research facility. She progresses quickly and meets Shay, who looks like Mila, another feral child, and thought that they were alike, two girls that are different from the people around them. Shay is a quiet girl. As more time passes, she falls in love with music and Doctor Beck's son Justin, and wonders why she progresses so quickly, yet Shay cannot. Shay is sent to another home, with other children. And Sandy explains to Mila that the feral children that have been studied, they have stopped progressing at a point, all except for Mila. Soon, Mila finds her newfound knowledge slipping away and becomes more dolphin again. She requests to be released back to the ocean and after some discussing among her caregivers, she was being returned to the ocean and reunites with her dolphin family. ==Characters== Mila: The protagonist of the story, a girl raised by dolphins. She is captured on a cay and taken to a scientific research facility, where she is taught to be a human and Doctor Beck who help her in her struggle to learn English and about human life.

Later he tells Mila that Dr. Beck's interest in Mila is more scientific than familial. However, the two fall in love in the climax of the story. Sandy: A friend of Dr. Beck's. She sometimes acts as a caregiver of Mila, who finds Sandy to be the most sympathetic and understanding person in the story. Mr. Aradondo: A janitor at the facility where Mila is kept.
