    "text": "West Portal station is a Muni Metro station in the West Portal neighborhood in San Francisco, California. It is built around the western entrance to the Twin Peaks Tunnel. The station consists of two side platforms, with the entrance at the western end. A non-accessible footbridge connects the platforms inside fare control. ==History== Former street-level stop outside Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1967 Opening in 1918, the station originally was similar to a regular curbside stop at the entrance to the tunnel. But when streetcar system was partially converted to light rail in the late 1970s, the existing underground metro station was built in its place. On July 18, 2009, the West Portal station was the scene of a collision between a K Ingleside train and a L Taraval train. An estimated 44 people were injured. The station was temporarily closed from June 25 to August 24, 2018, during the Twin Peaks Tunnel shutdown. West Portal is a bottleneck for Muni Metro trains in all directions, as automobiles blocking train traffic momentarily can cause cascading delays. During the shutdown, new switches and a new control panel were installed to improve manual operation of the intersection. In 2019, parking control officers were assigned to direct traffic through the unsignaled intersection, which reduced delays by 40%. As part of August 2020 changes to Muni Metro, the K and L were through-routed as an all-surface line, with frequent S Shuttle service between West Portal and Embarcadero. Mini-high platforms were constructed on Ulloa Street at West Portal to provide accessible transfer between the K/L and subway trains. The forced transfer at West Portal was criticized by disability advocates. ==References== ==External links== *SFMTA - West Portal Station inbound and outbound *SFBay Transit (unofficial) - Metro West Portal Station Category:Muni Metro stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1918 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1982 Category:1918 establishments in California ",
