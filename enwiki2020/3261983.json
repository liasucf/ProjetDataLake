    "text": "Dinefwr was a local government district of Dyfed, Wales from 1974 to 1996. It was named after Dinefwr Castle which was the court of the House of Dinefwr and one of the three principal royal courts of Wales with Aberffraw and Shrewsbury. It was formed by the merger of the borough of Llandovery, the urban districts of Ammanford, Cwmamman and Llandeilo along with Llandeilo Rural District, from the administrative county of Carmarthenshire. The inaugural elections to the authority were held in 1973. Further elections were held in 1976, 1979, 1983, 1987 and 1991. Independent councillors held a majority of the seats on the authority throughout its existence and the most significant political grouping was the Labour Party who held a number of seats in the former mining wards of the Amman Valley. In 1996 the district was abolished under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. It was replaced by the new unitary authority of Carmarthenshire, which covers the areas of the former districts of Carmarthen, Llanelli and Dinefwr. ==Elections== * 1973 Dinefwr Borough Council election * 1976 Dinefwr Borough Council election * 1979 Dinefwr Borough Council election * 1983 Dinefwr Borough Council election * 1987 Dinefwr Borough Council election * 1991 Dinefwr Borough Council election ==See also== *Dinefwr Park *Dinefwr Castle *House of Dinefwr ==References== ==External links== *Abandoned Communities ....
