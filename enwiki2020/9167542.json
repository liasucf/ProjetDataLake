His parents were Guy De Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, (1272\u20131315), Warwick) and Alice De Toeni, later Countess of Warwick who had seven children including John. Towards the end of his life he resided in the parish of St. Andrew, near Baynard's Castle, City of London. He bequeathed his house to the King who had it converted for use as his great wardrobe. A bachelor, he died without issue and his barony expired. His remains were interred, between two pillars, before the image of the Virgin, on the south side of the nave of Old St Paul's Cathedral, where there was a monument to his memory, incorrectly later known as Duke Humphrey's Tomb, because of the mistaken belief that it was the tomb of Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester.W. Carew Hazlitt, Faiths and Folklores, 1905, p. 196. The grave and monument were destroyed along with the old cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666.
