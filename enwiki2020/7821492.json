    "text": "Kenneth George Beamish (born 25 August 1947) is an English former football player, coach and manager. In his playing days he was a forward, and he scored a total of 159 goals in 555 Football League games. He started his career at Tranmere Rovers in 1965, and in six years at the club would make close to 200 appearances. From March 1972, he then spent three years with Brighton & Hove Albion, making around 100 appearances. In May 1974 he signed with Blackburn Rovers for \u00a325,000, and went on to play close to 100 games with the club in a two-year spell. Bought by Port Vale for \u00a312,000 in September 1976, he was voted the club's Player of the Year in 1977\u201378, and was the club's top scorer for two consecutive seasons. Sold to Bury for \u00a335,000 in September 1978, he played around 50 games, before he moved back to Tranmere Rovers in 1979. In 1981, he transferred to Swindon Town, before he announced his retirement the following year. He later served as Swindon's manager in the 1983\u201384 campaign. ==Playing career== Beamish started his career with Fourth Division Tranmere Rovers in 1966, under the management of Dave Russell. Rovers missed out on promotion at the end of 1965\u201366 after finishing behind fourth place Colchester United on goal average. Promotion was achieved in 1966\u201367, after the club finished fourth, four points ahead of Crewe Alexandra. Tranmere retained their Third Division status in 1967\u201368, 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, and 1970\u201371. Beamish was the club's top scorer two out of his six seasons with the club. Now managed by Jackie Wright, Rovers struggled in 1971\u201372, and in March 1972, Beamish switched to league rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. Beamish enjoyed a successful start to his Brighton career, as the club won promotion as Third Division runners-up in 1971\u201372. However the club struggled in the Second Division, and finished in last place in 1972\u201373. Manager Pat Saward was replaced by Brian Clough, but the 1973\u201374 campaign was also difficult, as Brighton avoided their second successive relegation by eight points. Beamish was signed by Gordon Lee's Blackburn Rovers for a \u00a325,000 fee in May 1974. He soon built a good understanding with strike partner Don Martin. The 1974\u201375 season was successful, as Blackburn were promoted to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division, with Beamish claiming 11 of he and Martin's 26 goal haul. Rovers finished mid-table in 1975\u201376 under the stewardship of Jim Smith. A popular player, fans would chant \"Beamo, Beamo\" years after he left Ewood Park. He joined Third Division Port Vale for \u00a312,000 in September 1976 and went straight into the first team. He became the club's top scorer in the 1976\u201377 season with 18 goals in 44 games; three of these goals came against Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 3 January. He was voted Player of the Year for his 16 goals in 49 games in the 1977\u201378 season; he scored ten goals more than his closest rival Jeff Hemmerman, as the club were relegated into the Fourth Division. He started the 1978\u201379 campaign with four goals in four consecutive games, before he was sold on to Third Division Bury for \u00a335,000 in September 1978. He helped the \"Shakers\" to avoid relegation in 1978\u201379, as he scored 20 goals in 49 league games for the club before he returned to Tranmere Rovers in November 1979, now back in the Fourth Division and managed by John King. Rovers suffered in 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381, and had to apply (successfully) for re-election under Bryan Hamilton in 1981. He then transferred to Swindon Town, and played just two league games, as Swindon were relegated out of the Third Division in 1981\u201382. Throughout his career he played 555 games in the Football League, scoring 159 goals. ==Management career== After retiring as a player he became manager of Swindon Town. John Trollope had originally brought Beamish to the club as his assistant. After Trollope's unsuccessful venture into management came to an end, Beamish took over the reins from him towards the end of the 1982\u201383 season. Working on a tight budget, Beamish was given only full season in charge, in which he led the Town to their lowest ever league finish \u2013 seventeenth in Fourth Division. However, he did lead the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where former club Blackburn Rovers eliminated Swindon. When his contract expired at the end of the 1983\u201384 season, new sponsors Lowndes Lambert demanded a big-name manager, and Beamish was replaced by Lou Macari. He worked at Blackburn Rovers as commercial manager, from 1986 until his retirement in August 2012. ==Statistics== ===Playing statistics=== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Tranmere Rovers |1965\u201366 |Fourth Division |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |1966\u201367 |Fourth Division |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |1967\u201368 |Third Division |25||5||3||1||0||0||28||6 |- |1968\u201369 |Third Division |36||13||1||0||4||1||41||14 |- |1969\u201370 |Third Division |46||9||6||3||3||1||55||13 |- |1970\u201371 |Third Division |40||10||3||0||2||3||45||13 |- |1971\u201372 |Third Division |29||12||7||3||3||2||39||17 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !178!!49!!20!!7!!12!!7!!210!!63 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Brighton & Hove Albion |1971\u201372 |Third Division |14||6||0||0||0||0||14||6 |- |1972\u201373 |Second Division |38||9||1||0||1||1||40||10 |- |1973\u201374 |Third Division |44||12||0||0||1||0||45||12 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !96!!27!!1!!0!!2!!1!!99!!28 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Blackburn Rovers |1974\u201375 |Third Division |43||12||3||2||5||3||51||17 |- |1975\u201376 |Second Division |37||7||0||0||7||3||44||10 |- |1976\u201377 |Second Division |6||0||0||0||3||2||9||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !86!!19!!3!!2!!15!!8!!104!!29 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Port Vale |1976\u201377 |Third Division |37||12||5||4||2||2||44||18 |- |1977\u201378 |Third Division |42||13||4||3||3||0||49||16 |- |1978\u201379 |Fourth Division |6||4||0||0||2||0||8||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !85!!29!!9!!7!!7!!2!!101!!38 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Bury |1978\u201379 |Third Division |35||16||4||1||0||0||39||17 |- |1979\u201380 |Third Division |14||4||0||0||5||1||19||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !49!!20!!4!!1!!5!!1!!58!!22 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Tranmere Rovers |1979\u201380 |Fourth Division |27||9||3||2||0||0||30||11 |- |1980\u201381 |Fourth Division |32||6||2||1||4||0||38||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !59!!15!!5!!3!!4!!0!!68!!18 |- |Swindon Town |1981\u201382 |Third Division |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !555!!159!!42!!20!!45!!19!!642!!198 |} ===Managerial statistics=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Swindon Town |align=left|April 1983 |align=left|June 1984 |- !colspan=3|Total |} ==Honours== ;Individual *Port Vale F.C.
