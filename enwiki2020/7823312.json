He also supported state takeovers of mismanaged school districts, pushing for a seizure of the Newark Public Schools in 1995. Ewing opposed state funding for economically disadvantaged schools and felt that there was no reason that richer districts could not be better supported than poorer ones, noting that \"Some people drive a Mercedes; some drive a Ford Taurus, like me\", but \"[w]e can't pay for everyone to drive a Mercedes\". In 1996 his wife, Allison Ewing then age 76, pulled her car over to talk to a friend, Peggy Pulleyn, age 85. Peggy was walking down a road in Bedminster and Allison killed her with her car.
