    "text": "This article attempts to list the oldest extant buildings in the state of Mississippi in the United States. Some dates are approximate and based upon dendochronology, architectural studies, and historical records. The area that is now Mississippi was originally inhabited by Native Americans. The city of Natchez was first established by French Colonists in 1716, and is one of the oldest and most historically important European settlements on the Mississippi River. The region was colonized and traded between French, Spanish, British, and American forces during the 1700s and a diverse architectural legacy remains visible in about ten surviving structures from that period. To be listed here a building must: *date to Mississippi statehood in 1817 or prior; or *be the oldest building in a region, large city, or oldest of its type (government building, style, etc.) ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
