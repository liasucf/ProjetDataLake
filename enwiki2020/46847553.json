Thapki leaves with Kabir. Bihaan tries to stop her. Shraddha tells Sankar that she knows that she had blackmailed Thapki and they form an alliance. Aditi overhears them and tells Bihaan.

Amma Mai wants Bani to marry her son Prince. Shraddha tries to make an alliance with Amma Mai. Shraddha's plan is revealed by Thapki. When Bihaan tries to save Bani, Bihaan is shot by Amma Mai and dies. Amma Mai and Monty are arrested. Bani blames her mother Thapki for Bihaan's death and leaves home. Kosi takes Bani in. Thapki is then kidnapped by Shraddha. Vasu rescues Thapki and defeats Shraddha. ===15 years later=== Tina is to marry Samar. Bani and Kosi arrive to take revenge on Thapki. Thapki asks Aryan, who looks like Bihaan, to impersonate Bihaan. Aryan is the older brother of Bani's fianc\u00e9, Manav. On the day of marriage, Kosi creates mayhem in which Tina marries Manav and Bani marries Samar. Bani apologises to Thapki and Kosi is arrested.
