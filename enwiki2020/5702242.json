    "text": "Lawrie George Dudfield (born 7 May 1980) is an English former professional footballer. He played for a number of professional clubs, including Kettering Town, Leicester City, Hull City, Northampton Town, Notts County and Southend United. Dudfield made over 300 career appearances including playing in the Premier League, later becoming the most expensive player in Hull City's history in June 2001. After retiring from football in 2009 Dudfield launched Iconz Experience Ltd. a company specialising in UK Soccer Tours and EPL Soccer Clinics featuring many current and former Professional Footballers. He now spends his time between the UK and the United States. == Career == ===Leicester City=== Dudfield started off his career at Kettering Town where at 16 years and 2 months he became the youngest player to play in the National League in August 1996. After making 14 appearances in all competitions including 3 starts Dudfield was signed by Leicester City on his 17th birthday, spending 4 years working his way up from being the top scorer in the youth and reserve teams in the first 2 years before making his EPL debut in April 2000 at home to Everton as a replacement for Tony Cottee. He went on to make two appearances in the Premier League and was named on the substitutes bench a further 11 times in his breakthrough season. On 15 September 2000 Dudfield joined Lincoln City on a month's loan for further experience, making his Football League debut for the club in the 1\u20131 home draw with Blackpool the following day. Following this experience he then starred on loan for Chesterfield, scoring five goals in fourteen appearances as the club were successfully promoted as League 2 Champions. ===Hull City=== Chesterfield were keen to secure a permanent transfer for Dudfield following his successful loan spell however due to the reputation he was forming for himself other clubs came in for him and in June 2001 Hull City broke their transfer record to bring Dudfield to the club by signing him for over \u00a3250,000. He spent two successful seasons at Hull City playing 59 times, scoring 17 goals and becoming a firm fans favourite so much so that he still regularly guests on local sports shows in the area as well as occasionally taking up co-commentary duty on Hull City's EPL and EFL games for BBC Humberside. In the 2001/2002 season Dudfield's performances earned him the annual Supporters Club Player of the Year Award. ===Northampton Town=== He fell out of favour with New Hull City manager Peter Taylor, who had coincidentally had sold him from Leicester City, and was sent out on loan to Northampton, who liked what they saw and signed him for a fee of \u00a325,000. He spent one season at Northampton Town playing 32 games and scoring 7 goals. He then made the move to Southend United on loan following the appointment of Colin Calderwood as the new manager. ===Southend United=== Dudfield hit the ground running immediately on loan with his new club scoring 5 goals in his loan spell, 3 of them match winning goals, as his goals helped fire Southend United up from the bottom of League 2 to mid table safety. Following the conclusion of his loan spell Dudfield made known his desire to stay with the club and subsequently turned down more attractive offers from clubs including Yeovil Town, Peterborough United and Luton Town in order to remain at the club. It proved to be a wise decision as during his spell at Southend United he became a firm fans favourite as the club were promoted to League 1 via a win over Lincoln City in the League 2 Play Off Final at the Millennium Stadium. Dudfield would in fact appear in 3 major finals at the Millennium Stadium (staged there as the new Wembley Stadium was being built) for Southend United during his spell at the club with Southend United also reaching consecutive LDV Finals. Following promotion to League 1 it was expected that Dudfield would remain at the club however he had a disagreement with owner Ron Martin, who he felt had reneged on his word to offer him a new improved contract, and left the club \"out of principle\" stating that he was a man of his word and expected the same in return. Dudfield left the club immediately after promotion despite Martin expecting him to return for pre-season and never returned to the club. ===Notts County=== His contract situation saw him make appearances for Boston United before Notts County signed Dudfield in the summer of 2006. He signed a two- year contract, which kept him there until the summer of 2008. During his two- year spell at the club, Dudfield relaunched his career showing his versatility by playing Centre Forward, Right Midfield and Left Wing as he played 74 games for the Magpies scoring on 17 occasions. In the 2006\u20132007 season Dudfield formed an impressive partnership with Jason Lee as the strikers scored 35 goals between them. His form earned him a Player of the Year nomination. In 2007-2008 Dudfield was used as the main striker for the new management team and was a mainstay of the team, often playing as a sole striker. Following the end of the season Dudfield announced he was leaving the club to seek new opportunities. ===Cork City=== On 25 July 2008, he signed a contract with League of Ireland side Cork City, having impressed manager Alan Mathews during a training period at the club. Dudfield scored several important goals for the club in the last couple of months of the 2008 season, and featured in the UEFA Cup and Setanta Sports Cup final, in which they beat Glentoran 2\u20131 to win the competition for the first time. Dudfield then decided to return home, turning down the offer of a new two-year deal, in order to retire from football due to the troublesome knee injury that had continued to take its toll. == Management == ===Quorn=== In September 2011, Dudfield was appointed as first team manager at semi-pro Quorn of the Evo-Stik League, who under their previous manager had lost the first 9 games of the season. He held the position for several months taking the club off the bottom of the League, including wins against eventual champions Ilkeston FC, before leaving a month before the end of the 2011/12 season. Quorn FC remains Dudfield only coaching role to date despite being linked with a number of coaching roles at professional clubs, most notably Notts County. == Career after Football == ===Iconz Experience Ltd.=== Upon his retirement from full-time professional football in 2009, Dudfield began employment at Nottingham Forest and worked in various roles through to his departure in May 2015. In early 2015 Dudfield launched his own company, Iconz Experience Ltd. focussing on UK Soccer Tour's as well as hosting 'EPL Soccer Clinics' abroad. Specialising in using former Premier League footballers as the main attraction, Iconz Experience Ltd. exhibited at the 2013 Soccerex festival in Rio de Janeiro with a host of international household names including Ruud Gullit, Aron Winter and Gaizka Mendieta. On 1 June 2015, Iconz Experience signed an official partnership agreement with Nottingham Forest to exclusively host all 'Nottingham Forest UK Soccer Tours' from countries such as the U.S, Australia and various other countries. Since 2015, former Manchester United and England Striker Alan Smith has been the official ambassador for Iconz Experience Ltd. and coaches including former Leicester City EPL boss Micky Adams have been linked with hands on roles at the company. ==Honours== ; Chesterfield * Football League Third Division promotion: 2000\u201301 ; Southend United * Football League Two play-offs winners: 2004\u201305 ; Cork City * Setanta Sports Cup: 2008 ==References== ==External links== * *Lincoln City F.C.
