    "text": "\"XS\" is a song by Japanese-British singer-songwriter Rina Sawayama, released on 2 March 2020, as the third single off of her debut studio album, Sawayama, via the label Dirty Hit. The song criticises capitalism in the face of climate change over a pop, R&B;, avant-pop and rock soundscape. A remix featuring British singer-rapper Bree Runway, was released on 10 July 2020. ==Background, themes and composition== Sawayama said in a statement that \"XS\" is a song that \"mocks capitalism in a sinking world\": \"XS\" is a 2000s-inspired pop, R&B;, avant-pop and electropop song with \"upbeat bubblegum pop vibes\" composed in the key of D minor with a tempo of 117 beats per minute. It begins with an \"eerie\" buildup of violins, while a \"shredding\" guitar riff appears before and after the chorus. ==Music video== The music video for \"XS\" was uploaded on YouTube on 17 April 2020, the same day as Sawayama's self-titled debut album was released. It currently has over 4 million views, making it the most-viewed video on Sawayama's channel. It was directed by Ali Kurr, who had also previously directed the music video for her other single, \"STFU!\". In the video, Sawayama portrays a \"QVC-like\" \"robotic\" saleswoman who attends a shopping channel broadcast to promote a beverage named \"RINA Water\", which consists 99% of 24-karat gold and 1% of plasma. It is then later revealed that the liquid is extracted from a creature which is chained in an underground factory. ==Track listing== *Digital download/streaming #\"XS\" \u2013 3:21 *Digital download/streaming \u2013 Bree Runway Remix #\"XS\" (Bree Runway Remix) \u2013 3:22 == References == Category:Rina Sawayama songs Category:2020 songs Category:2020 singles Category:Dirty Hit singles Category:Songs about consumerism Category:Pop songs Category:Contemporary R&B; songs Category:Avant-pop songs Category:Songs written by Nate Campany ",
