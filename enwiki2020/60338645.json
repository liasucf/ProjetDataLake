The monument was meant to recall those fallen in the battles of World War I between 1915-1918. While completed some years before, the bronze statue was only installed in 1926 with the King in attendance.Comune of Pistoia, short blurb and photoTuscan Cultural property, short catalogue of monuments. The bronze statue depicts a muscular, semi nude, semi-recumbent man sheltering a statue of victory as he glares to the distance. The statue is on a marble base with flanking bas-reliefs depicting a Winged victory and a mother and child sharing bundles of wheat (fasce). The sculptor, Silvio Carnevari (1891-1953) would go on to sculpt depictions of athletes for the Stadio Mussolini] in Rome. Many of this statues, including The Pugilist and his Monument to Victory (Monument to those fallen in the wars of Africa) at Civita Castellana, also focus on the athletic man in combat.Gente di Tuscia, short biography on Canevari. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Pistoia Category:Monuments and memorials in Tuscany Category:World War I memorials in Italy Category:Italian fascist architecture Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1925 ",
