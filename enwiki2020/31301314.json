It borders Tibet to the north and is bound by tributaries of the Wong Chhu (Raid\u0101k) basin to the west.

Thus, most of northern Bhutan is part of these protected areas. Wangchuck Centennial was established on December 12, 2008 in honor of the Wangchuck dynasty, founded in 1907. It contains headwaters of four major river systems: Punatsang Chhu, Mangde Chhu, Chamkhar Chhu, and Kuri Chhu.
