    "text": "Alexander Graeme Dickson (23 May 1914 \u2013 23 September 1994) founded Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) in 1958. VSO was created to send volunteers to developing countries, and Dickson's idea came from his own \"Christian but non- denominational faith\". The first volunteers went to Sarawak, Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia. In 1951, Dickson married writer, artist and campaigner Mora Dickson (n\u00e9e Robertson) (20 April 1918 \u2013 17 December 2001), author of A Chance To Serve (1976) recounting the beginnings of VSO. On leaving VSO in 1962, the Dicksons formed Community Service Volunteers, which focused on UK-based volunteer projects. Alec Dickson became a MBE in 1945 and a CBE in 1967. A plaque marking the London house where he died was erected by the Bedford Park Society. ==References== ==External links== *Obituary Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Chiswick ",
