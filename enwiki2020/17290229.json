    "text": "The 1947 U.S. Open was the 47th U.S. Open, held June 12\u201315 at St. Louis Country Club in Ladue, Missouri, a suburb west of St. Louis. Lew Worsham denied Sam Snead his elusive U.S. Open title by prevailing in an 18-hole playoff. For Snead, it was his second of four career runner-up finishes at the Open. In the third round, amateur Jim McHale Jr. tied the tournament record with a 65, and he established a new nine-hole record with a 30 on the front nine. That mark was equaled fifteen times before it was broken in 1995 by Neal Lancaster, who carded a 29 on the back nine in the final round. Worsham's win marked the 17th consecutive victory in a major championship for an American- born golfer. This remains the longest stretch ever for American golfers. A significant reason this occurred is because the British Open, which is usually won by international golfers, was cancelled for most of the 1940s due to World War II. The purse was $10,000 with a winner's share of $2,000 and $1,500 for the runner-up. In addition, both playoff participants received a $500 bonus. ==Course layout== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !align=\"left\"|Hole!!1!!2!!3!!4!!5!!6!!7!!8!!9!!Out!!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18!!In!!Total |- | align=\"center\"|Yards||395||233||187||421||545||325||150||347||537||3,140||349||399||180||576||416||500||188||365||419||3,392||6,532 |- | align=\"center\"|Par||4||3||3||4||5||4||3||4||5||35||4||4||3||5||4||5||3||4||4||36||71 |} Source: == Past champions in the field == === Made the cut === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left| Lloyd Mangrum|| align=left| ||1946 || 77 || 72 || 69 || 75 || 293 || +9 || T23 |- | align=left|Billy Burke || align=left| || 1931 || 74 || 75 || 71 || 74 || 294 || +10 || T27 |- | align=left| Lawson Little|| align=left| ||1940 || 72 || 69 || 76 || 71 || 296 || +12 || T23 |- | align=left|Gene Sarazen || align=left| || 1922, 1932 || 72 || 75 || 74 || 79 || 300 || +16 || T39 |- | align=left| Ralph Guldahl|| align=left| ||1937, 1938 || 74 || 77 || 76 || 77 || 304 || +20 || T55 |- | align=left|Tony Manero || align=left| || 1936 || 74 || 75 || WD || || || || |} Source: === Missed the cut === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Player || Country || Year won || R1 || R2 || Total || To par |- | align=left|Tommy Armour || align=left| || 1927 || 78 || 78 || 156 || +14 |- | align=left|Sam Parks, Jr. || align=left| || 1935 || 78 || 83 || 161 || +19 |- |} Source: ==Round summaries== ===First round=== Thursday, June 12, 1947 {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T1 || |Chick Harbert || || rowspan=3 align=center|67 || rowspan=3 align=center|\u22124 |- |Henry Ransom || |- |Harry Todd || |- |align=center|4 || Bobby Locke || || align=center|68 || align=center|\u22123 |- |rowspan=4 align=center|T5 || Leland Gibson || || rowspan=4 align=center|69 || rowspan=4 align=center|\u22122 |- |Otto Greiner|| |- |Dick Metz || |- |Bud Ward (a) || |- |rowspan=5 align=center|T9 || Ed Furgol || || rowspan=5 align=center|70 || rowspan=5 align=center|\u22121 |- |Ben Hogan || |- |Al Smith || |- |Horton Smith || |- |Lew Worsham || |} Source: ===Second round=== Friday, June 13, 1947 {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T1 || |Chick Harbert || || 67-72=139 || rowspan=2 align=center|\u22123 |- |Dick Metz || || 69-70=139 |- |align=center|3 || Lew Worsham || || 70-70=140 || align=center|\u22122 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T4 || Jim Ferrier || || 71-70=141 || rowspan=3 align=center|\u22121 |- |Henry Ransom || || 67-74=141 |- |Bud Ward (a) || || 69-72=141 |- |rowspan=4 align=center|T7 || Bobby Locke || || 68-74=142 || rowspan=4 align=center|E |- |Johnny Palmer || || 72-70=142 |- |Sam Snead || || 72-70=142 |- |Harry Todd || || 67-75=142 |} Source: ===Third round=== Saturday, June 14, 1947 (morning) {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |align=center|1 || Lew Worsham || || 70-70-71=211 || align=center|\u22122 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T2 || Bobby Locke || || 68-74-70=212 || rowspan=2 align=center|\u22121 |- | Sam Snead || || 72-70-70=212 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T4 || |Ed Oliver || || 73-70-71=214 || rowspan=2 align=center|+1 |- |Bud Ward (a) || || 69-72-73=214 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T6 || Jim Ferrier || || 71-70-74=215 || rowspan=3 align=center|+2 |- |Ben Hogan || || 70-75-70=215 |- |Joe Kirkwood, Sr. || || 72-73-70=215 |- |align=center|9 || Sammy Byrd || || 72-74-70=216 || align=center|+3 |- |rowspan=4 align=center|T10 || Ed Furgol || || 70-75-72=217 || rowspan=4 align=center|+4 |- |Dick Metz || || 69-70-78=217 |- |Johnny Palmer || || 72-70-75=217 |- |Paul Runyan || || 71-74-72=217 |} Source: ===Final round=== Saturday, June 14, 1947 Worsham began the final round with a stroke lead over Snead and Bobby Locke. A front- nine 33 kept him in the lead, but after three bogeys on the back he had to settle for a 71 and a 282 total. Snead overcame two early bogeys with birdies at 5, 6, and 15. After a bogey at 17, Snead needed a birdie on the 72nd hole to tie Worsham and force a playoff the next day. His approach shot left him away, which he rolled in for final-round 70. Locke shot 73 to finish three strokes back, in a tie for third place. {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money ($) |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T1 || Lew Worsham || || 70-70-71-71=282 || rowspan=2 align=center|\u22122 || rowspan=2 align=center|Playoff |- | Sam Snead || || 72-70-70-70=282 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T3 || Bobby Locke || || 68-74-70-73=285 || rowspan=2 align=center|+1 || rowspan=2 align=center|900 |- |Ed Oliver || || 73-70-71-71=285 |- |align=center|5 || Bud Ward (a) || || 69-72-73-73=287 || align=center|+3 || align=center|0 |- |rowspan=6 align=center|T6 || Jim Ferrier || || 71-70-74-74=289 || rowspan=6 align=center|+5 || rowspan=6 align=center|400 |- |Vic Ghezzi || || 74-73-73-69=289 |- |Leland Gibson || || 69-76-73-71=289 |- |Ben Hogan || || 70-75-70-74=289 |- |Johnny Palmer || || 72-70-75-72=289 |- |Paul Runyan || || 71-74-72-72=289 |} Source: :(a) denotes amateur === Playoff === Sunday, June 15, 1947 In the 18-hole playoff on Sunday morning, Snead led Worsham by two strokes with just three holes remaining. Worsham birdied the par-3 16th with a putt and Snead bogeyed 17 after he missed the fairway and overshot the green from the rough. The match was all-even at the tee of the 90th hole, a par-4 of . Both put lengthy drives in the fairway, and Snead's approach shot stopped pin-high and left of the hole. Worsham was long and lay feet past the cup on the apron of the green. His downhill chip hit the hole without dropping, and ended up away, leaving Snead his birdie putt for the win. Snead left it well short and as he prepared to hole out in continuation, Worsham called for an official to determine who was further away. With a tape measure, it was determined that it remained Snead's turn, who was visibly flustered with the unnecessary interruption and delay. Snead missed the putt. Worsham then rolled in his par-saving putt for a 69 and the title, which averted an additional 18-hole playoff in the afternoon. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money ($) |- | align=center|1|| Lew Worsham || ||align=center|69 ||align=center|\u22122|| align=center|2,500 |- | align=center|2 || Sam Snead || ||align=center|70 || align=center|\u22121|| align=center|2,000 |} *Prize money includes $500 playoff bonus for each. ====Scorecard==== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Hole!! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9 !!10!!11!!12!!13!!14!!15!!16!!17!!18 |- |Par||4||3||3||4||5||4||3||4||5|| 4||4||3||5||4||5||3||4||4 |- |align=left| Worsham||E||E||E||E||E||E||E||style=\"background: PaleGreen;\"|+1||style=\"background: Pink;\"|E||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22121||\u22121||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22122||\u22122||\u22122||style=\"background: PaleGreen;\"|\u22121||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22122||\u22122||\u22122 |- |align=left| Snead||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22121||\u22121||\u22121||\u22121||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22122||style=\"background: Green;\"|E||E||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22121||\u22121||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22122||\u22122||\u22122||style=\"background: Pink;\"|\u22123||\u22123||\u22123||\u22123||style=\"background: PaleGreen;\"|\u22122||style=\"background: PaleGreen;\"|\u22121 |} :{|class=\"wikitable\" span = 50 style=\"font-size:85%; |- |style=\"background: Pink;\" width=10| |Birdie |style=\"background: PaleGreen;\" width=10| |Bogey |style=\"background: Green;\" width=10| |Double bogey |} Source: ==References== ==External links== *About.com \u2013 1947 U.S. Open *USGA Championship Database Category:U.S. Open (golf) Category:Golf in Missouri U.S. Open U.S. Open U.S. Open U.S. Open ",
