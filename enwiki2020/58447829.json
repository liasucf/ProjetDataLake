In the first round, held on 9 September (which was the common election day in Russia), none of the candidates received an absolute majority. The candidates proceeding to the second round, scheduled for 16 September, were incumbent Acting Governor Andrey Tarasenko, nominated by the United Russia, and Andrey Ishchenko, nominated by the Communist Party.\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0440 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442 16 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f The second round of election was subject to public protect due to perceived inconsistencies in the counting of votes. During most of the counting, Ishchenko was in the lead by a margin of around 5%. However, after 95% of votes had been counted, Tarasenko began to gain ground. By 99% counted, he had gained a lead over Ishchenko. The official final results indicated Tarasenko had won with 49.55% of votes to Ishchenko's 48.06%, a margin of 7,650 votes. The sudden shift in the results triggered accusations of electoral fraud, and the Central Electoral Commissions sent representatives to Primorsky Krai to review the situation. On 19 September, they recommended invalidating the election results. On 20 September, the Regional Election Commission followed this recommendation and officially invalidated the results, leading to a new election held in December. ==Previous events== Previous gubernatorial election in Primorsky Krai were held on 14 September 2014, Vladimir Miklushevsky was elected as Governor. On 4 October 2017, he resigned, and Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Andrey Tarasenko as Acting Governor. ==Candidates== Five candidates were registered to participate in the election\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0445. \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0413\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! colspan=3 | Candidate !

The planned reform has provoked countrywide protests. For this reason, the elections proceeded on a background of an aversion to the governmental party \u201cUnited Russia\u201d (which was the only party in the parliament supporting the reform) as to the betrayers. In the second round, the anti-reform forces were consolidated around Ishchenko as a person not belonging to that party. So, despite Tarasenko has unequivocally won the first round, Ishchenko succeeded in obtaining a comparable number of votes in the second round. ==Results== The results of the first (left) and second (right) rounds by territorial election commissions. |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" ! style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Candidate ! style=\"text- align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Party ! colspan=\"2\"| 1st round ! colspan=\"2\"| 2nd round |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;text-align:center;\" ! width=\"75\"|Votes ! width=\"30\"|% ! width=\"75\"|Votes ! width=\"30\"|% |- | style=\"background-color:;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrey Tarasenko | style=\"text-align:left;\"| United Russia | UR | '''''' | 46.56 | '''''' | 49.55 |- | style=\"background-color:;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrey Ishchenko | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Communist Party | CPRF | '''''' | 24.63 | | 48.06 |- |bgcolor=#c50d13| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Yulia Tolmacheva | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Party of Pensioners |RPPSJ | | 10.80 | style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"| |- | style=\"background-color:;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andrey Andreychenko | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Liberal Democratic Party | LDPR | | 9.27 |- | style=\"background-color:;\"| | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alexey Kozitsky | style=\"text-align:left;\"| A Just Russia | JR | | 4.83 |- | style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9;\" colspan=\"8\"| |- style=\"font-weight:bold\" | style=\"text- align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"| Total | | 100.00 | | 100.00 |- | style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9;\" colspan=\"8\"| |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"| Valid votes | | 96.09 | | 97.61 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"| Blank ballots | | 3.91 | | 2.39 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"| Turnout | | 30.23 | | 35.43 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"4\"| Registered voters | | style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;\"| | | style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;\"| |- | style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9;\" colspan=\"8\"| |- | style=\"text- align:left;font-size:90%;\" colspan=\"8\"| Official results published by the Primorsky Krai Electoral Commission 1st round result2nd round result |} Exit polls on the day of the second round have also shown a victory of Tarasenko. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line- height:14px\" |- !rowspan=2|Poll source !Tarasenko !Ishchenko |- |bgcolor=| |bgcolor=| |- |KC Expert-group | 53%||47% |} ==Fairness of election== Andrey Ishchenko at a rally against rigging the election results near the building of the Government of Primorsky Krai After counting 95% of the protocols of the second round, the candidate from the Communist party Ishchenko won by a significant margin \u2014 51.6% against 45.8%.
