    "text": "Virtual Safari is a series of interactive virtual set-top games within The Lion King franchise, published on The Lion King DVDs. They featured Timon and Pumbaa going on virtual safari adventures. == Production == This series marked the first time that Buena Vista Home Entertainment collaborated \"so ambitiously\" with Disney Feature Animation and DisneyToon Studios to create a game of this type. Andy Siditsky, sr vp worldwide creative services and DVD production, explained that he wanted set a higher benchmark with what could be done in a set top experience: \"We started thinking about various theme park rides land Timon and Pumbaa were our natural hosts. That led to different ways of doing it and different pieces and wondering where would you go?\". He brainstormed ideas with a small team including re-recording mixer Terry Porter, discussing different types of tours. They worked closely with the Feature Animation team to develop the animation and assets for the game. As part of the research, the team traveled to Walt Disney World, hung around The Jungle Cruise and read some of scripts of the rides, using them as a guide. There was some trepidation over whether the team could successfully complete the project as it had never been done before. Describing it as an \"experiment\", Siditsky noted that it opened up the door to create virtual safari type of experiences down the line. Part of the challenge was in making it an engaging theme park ride while being relevant to The Lion King franchise and including some adult humour. An additional challenge was in making the animation quality up to the level of the film, considering time and budget constraints. Around 20% of The Lion King was repurposed for Virtual Safari. The first Virtual Safari game was released on The Lion King special edition after six months of work, which combined traditional and CG elements. A second was put onto The Lion King 1-1/2 DVD released Feb. 10, 2004. This one featured a roller coaster experience which was patterned after Mr. Toads Wild Ride to create a more comedic experience. Nathan Lane returned to voice Timon. == Gameplay == Virtual Safari is a cross between the Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones Disney theme park rides along with Kilimanjaro Safaris. Players press the left or right arrow buttons at decision making points to decide which way the vehicle travels. In the first game, Ernie Sabella reprised the voice of Pumbaa and a Nathan Lane sound-alike voiced Timon. == Entries == * Timon And Pumbaa\u2019s Virtual Safari Boat Tour *Timon And Pumbaa\u2019s Virtual Safari Jeep Tour * Timon And Pumbaa\u2019s Virtual Safari 1.5: The Lion King Prideland Adventure *Timon And Pumbaa\u2019s Virtual Safari 2.0: Prideland Pachiderm Safari == Critical reception == The Digital Bits felt the game would be appealing to young children, but noted that as someone who buys DVD out of a love of film, \"interactive games don't particularly do anything for me\". Sound and Vision felt it was one of the few aspects of the DVD specifically aimed at children. DVDCC said it was \"Worth checking out\". When speaking about how a featurette about the lost attraction The Little Mermaid Under the Sea Adventure was to b featured on The Little Mermaid 2-Disc DVD, DLP Today commented \"they\u2019ve taken the \u201cVirtual Safari\u201d idea from The Lion King\u2019s DVDs and transferred the concept to a real Disney theme park attraction\". DVD Mag said they didn't expect a lot from VS1.5 butt hat it offered a very fun experience. IGN felt it was \"definitely not as traumatic as the original virtual safari on The Lion King\". MousePlanet noted there is \"plenty of humor and adventure mixed in\" to VS2.0. AnimatedViews felt the game was impressing but lacked replay value due to not having much gameplay. == References == Category:The Lion King video games ",
