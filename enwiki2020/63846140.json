    "text": "Xhemail Abria (1830\u20131908) was a Kosovar intellectual and writer born in Gornje Obrinje, Drenica. ==Background== He was the son of Sefer Ku\u00e7i. Educated at home as a youth, he worked as a shepherd. Though self-taught, he was precocious and participated in the popular education of the time. ==Career== He was awarded the title Pleqnar i Kosov\u00ebs (\"Elder of Kosovo\") at the Junik Assembly of 1877 and raised his profile by attending the inaugural meeting of the League of Prizren in 1878. He represented Drenica at the subsequent meeting, presided over by Binak Alia, where the Karanarme decree was signed. Alia later passed the chairmanship on to Abria. In addition, he participated in the 1899 Assembly of Pe\u0107 (held near what is now De\u00e7an) and Deli Prekazi's Drenica revolt in 1903. ==The People's Genius== Xhemail Abria was known by three surnames: Abria (from his birthplace, known in Albanian as Abria e Ep\u00ebrme), the honorific Aga, and Seferi (from his father). Rising from illiteracy to a connoisseur's understanding of the philosophy, history, and geography of the Albanian people, he was given the sobriquet of Gjeniu i Popullit (\"The People\u2019s Genius\"). An apocryphal example was his response to a query from a village elder named Rexh\u00eb Hyseni from Belo Polje, near what is now Istok. The man asked Abria to solve a thorny dispute between two local clans over a family gravesite too old to otherwise identify. Abria suggested the following, akin to a crude version of modern DNA analysis: > Exhume one of the dead and get a bone from therein. Summon one man from each > family and obtain a drop of blood from each. Put each drop on the bone and > see which one is absorbed into the marrow, awarding the site to that drop\u2019s > bloodline. ==Quotes== * Fjala n`kam\u00eb nuk peshon rand!(\u201cWords have no weight standing (so sit)!\u201d) * Ma pive kafen e ftoft\u00eb!
