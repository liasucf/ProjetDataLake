    "text": "Suifenhe () is a county-level city in southeastern Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, located where the former Chinese Eastern Railway crosses the border with Russia's town of Pogranichny, Primorsky Krai. In January 2014 Suifenhe became the only Chinese city in which trading with Russian Ruble is allowed. The city shares its name with the Suifen River, and is under the administration of Mudanjiang Prefecture-level City. Suifenhe and the surrounding border areas were scenes of vicious combat when the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria in August 1945. ==Geography and climate== Suifenhe (labelled as Sui-fen-ho ) (1955) Suifenhe has a monsoon- influenced humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dwb), with long, very cold, but dry winters, and warm, humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperatures range from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Precipitation is light in the winter, and more than 2/3 of the year's precipitation occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 44% in July to 64% in January and February, the city receives 2,413 hours of bright sunshine annually, with the latter half of winter being especially sunny. ==Administrative divisions== Suifenhe administers two towns: *Suifenhe Town () *Funing () ==Transport== ===Road=== Suifenhe is also a terminus of both G10 Suifenhe\u2013Manzhouli Expressway and China National Highway 301, which run northwest to Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia), which is another China\u2013Russia port- of-entry. ===Road and rail border crossing=== Suifenhe is one of the points where China's and Russia's railway systems connect through a rail border crossing on the Sino-Russian border. The rail line was originally constructed as the Chinese Eastern Railway in the early 20th century, but now serves as the terminus of the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway. The train station on the opposite side of the border is Grodekovo, in the town of Pogranichny, Primorsky Krai. As of December 2009, Russian train schedule sites show the existence of the passenger train no. 401, making the 26-km trip between Suifenhe and Grodekovo twice a week; however, the twice-a-week trains no. 006, Khabarovsk\u2013Harbin, and no. 967, Vladivostok\u2013Harbin only have a scheduled stop in Grodekovo and not in Suifenhe.Russian train schedules site. One can search e.g. by entering \"Grodekovo\" as a station name, obtaining results like this: http://www.poezda.net/en/station_timetable?st_code=2034464&forDate;=08-12-2009 The through trains from Khabarovsk and Vladivostok may in reality be just single cars, or groups of cars, attached to a train terminating in Grodekovo, and then passed on to the Chinese railways. The cross-border rail line is important for freight transportation. As of 2015, the main cargo entering China from Russia over this railway crossing is iron ore; at 1.3 million tons over the first 5 months of the year, it constitutes about 1/3 of the total import cargo volume. The G10 Suifenhe\u2013Manzhouli Expressway and China National Highway 301, which terminates at Suifenhe is connected via a road border crossing to Russia's A184 Highway. The nearest city to the crossing on the Russian side is Pogranichny. ==Environmental issues== The Environmental Investigation Agency conducted an investigation in February 2008, in the illegal logging of Russian wood, which was taking place in Suifenhe. The main supplier of the wood, Wal-Mart, has recently acknowledged that the practice in Suifenhe is illegal, under Russian law, and has committed to end all illegal sales of wood in six years.The New Yorker. \"The Stolen Forests.\" Oct. 6, 2008. ==References== Category:Cities in Heilongjiang Category:China\u2013Russia border crossings Category:Mudanjiang ",
