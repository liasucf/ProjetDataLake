Kirksey is headquartered in Houston, Texas on a LEED certified corporate campus. Kirksey designs high- performance, healthy buildings for all clients. This was formalized through the creation of the EcoServices team, a private think-tank and consulting group whose focus is to mainstream environmentally friendly building practices. The team educates other firm members and the community on green building practices. A basicGREEN program was developed that prescribes sustainable design measures to be implemented on every project, regardless of LEED Certification and at no added cost to the project.
