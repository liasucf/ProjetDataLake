He is best known for being a member of the South Korean project boy band JBJ, and for finishing 21st in the survival show Produce 101 Season 2. == Life and career == Jin Longguo was born in Helong, Jilin, China on March 2, 1996. He is a Chaoxianzu of Gim clan of Gimhae descent. On November 10, 2018, he posted a picture of a handwritten letter addressing dating rumors with Sonamoo's Nahyun and the situation of one of his cats on his fan caf\u00e9. He denied the dating rumors, stating that they became friends after meeting multiple times at events. He also talked about the controversy of his cat Rcy, which rose after fans spotted a stray cat with similar markings as Rcy. Choon Entertainment explained that he adopted a new cat, Kagu, in June, who conflicted often with Rcy, and they put Rcy up for adoption. They claimed to have been unable to stay in touch with the new owner, and on September 25, they discovered he had escaped, and Rcy was apparently brought back to Choon Entertainment, where he was taken care of. His ear had been clipped, to show he was considered a stray and was recently sterilized. His appearances on The Show on November 11 and 18 were canceled, with former fellow JBJ member Kim Sanggyun and Golden Child's Bomin temporarily replacing him, but, as of November 18, it has not been announced whether he would remain as an MC. The same day, more controversies arose after Longguo's private Instagram was hacked and its contents released. In an apology letter, he wrote, \"I also feel very sorry for my behavior on my private Instagram account. When I wrote this letter I was very embarrassed by what I did. I will live more humbly than before, and think hundreds of times before acting.\" == Discography == === Extended plays === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Sales |- !
