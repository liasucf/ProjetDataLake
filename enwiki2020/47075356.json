    "text": "Penicillium parvum is an anamorph species of fungus in the genus Penicillium which was isolated from soil in Papua New Guinea.ATCC Penicillium parvum produces ferrichrome siderophores Phytochemical investigation of the soil microfungus Eupenicillum parvum led to the isolation of two new compounds: a chromone derivative euparvione and a new mycophenolic derivative euparvilactone, as well as thirteen known compounds. Several isolated compounds were evaluated for in vitro binding assays using opioid receptors (subtypes \u03b4, \u03ba, and \u03bc) and cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). Compound 10 displayed the best selective \u03bc-opioid receptor and CB1 receptor binding affinities showing values of 47% and 52% at a 10 \u03bcM concentration, respectively. These findings provide insight into the potential therapeutic utility of this class of compounds. == Further reading == * * * == References == parvum Category:Fungi described in 1948 ",
