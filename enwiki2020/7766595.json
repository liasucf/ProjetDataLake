    "text": "The August 29th Movement (or August Twenty-Ninth Movement, ATM), was a Chicano communist organization that lasted from 1974 to 1978. It formed out of the Labor Committee of La Raza Unida Party in Los Angeles, and other collectives, officially forming at a Unity Conference in May 1974. It was one of several organizations that were part of the New Communist Movement, which were influenced by the thought of Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin's theories on the National Question. The ATM published a manifesto, \"Fan The Flames: A Revolutionary Position on the Chicano National Question,\" in 1975. In it, the organization articulated the view that Chicanos living in the Southwestern United States were an oppressed nation due to the annexation of northern Mexico in the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u201348, and had a right to independence. The strategy of ATM, like other NCM formations, was to build a multinational communist party. The August Twenty-Ninth Movement published a newspaper, Revolutionary Cause, and a theoretical journal, The Red Banner. In New Mexico, the ATM chapter entered into the Chicano Communications Center, a media organization founded by Elizabeth \"Betita\" Martinez. They were responsible for the destruction of an entire edition of her book 450 Years of Chicano History, one of the first Chicano histories, due to disagreement of how ATM saw the books portrayal of the Chicano National Question.Martinez, Elizabeth Betita. \"A View from New Mexico: Recollections of the Movimiento Left.\" Monthly Review. July\u2013August 2002. http://www.monthlyreview.org/0702martinez.htm. In 1978, ATM merged with I Wor Kuen, an Asian-American Communist organization, to form the League of Revolutionary Struggle. ==Publications== * Dasco Strike: Lessons for the M-L Movement.
