    "text": "Blackjack is a name used for small American surveillance satellites to be launched starting in 2021. These will replace or compliment larger systems such as Misty and KH-11. These new orbiters will be cheaper, more numerous and short-lived than existing systems. The new devices could be launched more covertly, would be harder to track and attack and would be constantly replaced by new versions as the older ones fall to earth. Each would have limited capabilities, but would operate as part of a constellation of twenty to ninety satellites networked together. Costs would be reduced by using the common commercial satellite buses now available. In mid 2020, open sources indicated the first two satellites would be launched in the third quarter of 2021. ==See also== * Enhanced Imaging System * Future Imagery Architecture * KH-11 * Misty (satellite) ==References== Category:DARPA projects Category:National Reconnaissance Office satellites Category:Reconnaissance satellites of the United States ",
