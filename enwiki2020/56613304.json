He is the founding editor of Real Leaders, a leadership magazine that focuses exclusively on sustainability and ethical business. He has held the title of managing editor since the launch of the magazine in 2009. He is known for interviewing influential figures and celebrities such as Sharon Stone, Desmond Tutu, Sara Blakely, Sheryl Sandberg and Warren Buffett. Originally started as a members-only magazine for members of the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) Schreiber relaunched Real Leaders as a mainstream title at Barnes & Noble, New York in September 2017. He is the author of a series of best-selling books in South Africa, that explore dark subject matter with humor, the first of which was: \"Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Kak?\" in 2007 and \"Complete Kak\" in 2011. He cofounded a book imprint in 2002 called Two Dogs and collaborated with South African authors in writing books for men.HighBeam The books started a trend in South Africa, of books that tackled serious social issues with irreverent humor. In 2003 he was asked by the South African Government to redesign the new parliamentary mace, that replaced the old version used by the apartheid government. His artistic work on the mace is seen as a symbolic break with the past and a reinterpretation of national imagery, more suited to the post-1994 democratic elections, when Nelson Mandela was voted in as president. He was interviewed by Forbes in 2017. His opinions and writing have appeared in The New York Public Library, Inc. and The Baltimore Sun == References == Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:People from Cape Town ",
