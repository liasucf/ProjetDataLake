    "text": "Fang Weigui (; born 1957 in Shanghai) is a Chinese comparative literature scholar, sinologist, and literary translator.See K\u00fcrschner\u2019s Who is who of German scholars: K\u00fcrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender 2007: Bio- bibliographisches Verzeichnis deutschsprachiger Wissenschaftler der Gegenwart, 21st edition, 2007. Berlin; Boston; New York: DeGruyter / Saur, 2007. . - K\u00fcrschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender notes that Fang\u2019s main research focus is on \"Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft; moderne chinesische Kultur und Literatur; Sprachwandel des Chinesischen (Historische Semantik); chinesische Medien\" (i.e., comparative literature; modern Chinese culture and literature; language change of Chinese (historical semantics); [and] Chinese media). ==Early Years== Fang graduated from Shanghai International Studies University where he subsequently taught at the German Department before enrolling in a cooperative academic program of Beijing Foreign Studies University and Humboldt University of Berlin. At the time he wrote a thesis on Bertolt Brecht and Lu Xun that was published by a West German publisher in 1991.See the text Fang Weigui \u65b9\u7ef4\u89c4\u201d, ibidem. http://wxy.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/wyxyjs/91270.html Accessed Nov 23, 2017. Subsequently, he obtained a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from RWTH Aachen University. His doctoral dissertation on the image of China in German literature 1871\u20131933 was published 1992.The book was positively reviewed in the journal Hefte f\u00fcr ostasiatische Literatur (Cahiers on East Asian Literature, Munich), Nr. 15, Nov. 1993, S.144-146. This book was inspired by the theoretical work of the Aachen-based Belgian comparatist Hugo Dyserinck that was focused on what Dyserinck called \"imagology\".As Adrian Hsia noted in 1998, \"imagology is experiencing a renaissance in Europe. A recent example is the doctoral dissertation of a Chinese scholar from Shanghai with the subtitle \u201cEin Beitrag zur komparatistischen Imagologie\u201d (\u201cA Contribution to Comparative Imagology\u201d). As a student of the comparatist Hugo Dyserinck and benefitting from the latter\u2019s erudition, he devotes over 60 pages to delineating all aspects of imagology. (Adrian Hsia, Chinesia: The European Construction of China in the Literature of the 17th and 18th Centuries. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1998; p.13. - , 978-3-484-63016-1.) Dyserinck demanded critical research of mutually existing (ideological) auto-images and hetero- images current in \"national literatures\" like the French and the German that influenced each other.Thomas Krause thinks that Fang emphasized the recurrence of typical ideological images: \"Auff\u00e4llig ist, da\u00df bestimmte imagotype Elemente immer wieder mechanisch \u00fcbernommen und trotz ver\u00e4ndertem Kontext nur leicht ver\u00e4nder benutzt werden. Weigui Fang schlu\u00dffolgert daraus, da\u00df die charakteristischen Merkmale der Konstanz die 'Wirkungspotenz ', die '\u00dcberlieferungsm\u00f6glichkeiten' und die 'Gebr\u00e4uchlichkeit' sind. Dadurch, so seine \u00dcberlegungen, wird erst die 'Universalit\u00e4t' erm\u00f6glicht.\" (Thomas Krause, Die Fremde Rast Durchs Gehirn, Das Nichts\u2026: Deutschlandbilder in den Texten Der Banater Autorengruppe (1969-1991). Frankfurt; Berlin; Bern; New York; Paris: Peter Lang, 1998, p.19.) ==Career in Germany== Since 1992, Fang worked as research fellow at the University of Trier. While teaching courses on Chinese literature and being engaged in research at the university\"s Institute of Chinese Studies, he also wrote a Post-doctoral thesis on Chinese literature of the post-May 4th or Republican period (1919\u20131949). From 1996 to 2000, Fang was a senior research fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies of the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He was engaged in research on \"new knowledge\" in Late Qing China. Professor Michael Lackner advocated acceptance of Fang's post- doctoral thesis as a thesis of habilitation at the time. In 2001, Fang was employed as a senior research fellow at the Department of Chinese Literature and simultaneously at the Department of Communication Theory of Trier University. He worked in a media-focused research project initiated by both departments. In 2002, a slightly revised version of his post-doctoral thesis was accepted as his \"Habilitationsschrift\" by the University of Erlangen (Erlangen Umiversit\u00e4t, today the Erlangen campus of the University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg). This work, entitled Selbstreflexion in der Zeit des Erwachens und des Widerstands \u2013 Moderne Chinesische Literatur 1919-1949 (Self- reflection in the Period of Awakening and Resistance \u2013 Modern Chinese Literature, 1919-1949), was published by the Harrasowitz publishing company as a volume of a well-reputed series (Lun Wen: Studien zur Geistesgeschichte und Literatur im China, Vol. 7) in 2006. The book was positively reviewed by Prof. Wolfgang Kubin.Prof. Kubin wrote about this book: \u201ceine \u2026 gut lesbare Literaturgeschichte, die sch\u00f6n bebildert, klug nach Themen eingeteilt und vor allen Dingen verst\u00e4ndlich ist. \u2026 Wer China im 20. Jahrhundert verstehen will, kommt um dieses Buch nicht herum. Es bringt auf wunderbare Weise die gesamte Problematik des chinesischen Intellektuellen, man kann auch weitergehend sagen: des chinesischen Geistes, ja der Chinesen, auf einen Punkt. W\u00e4re der Verfasser in der Lage gewesen, diese Problematik auch in die Problematik des 20. Jahrhunderts der Weltgeschichte allgemein zu stellen, dann w\u00e4re er genial gewesen!\u201d See Wolfgang Kubin, \u201c WEIGUI FANG, Selbstreflexion in der Zeit des Erwachens und des Widerstands.

The book was also positively reviewed in the renowned scholarly journal Weimarer Beitr\u00e4ge.See the article \u201c Heute h\u00f6chst aktuell \u2013 der Blick zur\u00fcck, auf eine fast schon vergessene Phase des Umbruchs im \u2018Land der Mitte\u2019.

Since 2002, subsequent to his habilitation (or professorial, postdoctoral qualification), Fang Weigui was an Associate Professor (Privatdozent) lecturing at the Department of Middle Eastern and Far Eastern Languages and Cultures of Erlangen University (Universit\u00e4t Erlangen).At the time, Weigui Fang was probably the first citizen from an East Asian country to achieve his \u201chabilitation\u201d in Germany in recent decades. When he became a \u201cPrivatdozent,\u201d that was the utmost a Chinese citizen could achieve in that country. In fact, there were no full professors of Chinese or of comparative literature (\u201cordentliche Professoren\u201d with unlimited tenure) from China teaching at German universities when Fang was habilitated, and probably there are none today. There have been allegations that this was due to a \u201cclosed-shop policy\u201d of departments of Chinese, Japanese, French, English and so on to keep out foreign citizens who are native speakers of the language taught and who have a profound knowledge of their own culture. Foreigners were employed as lecturers or invited for short periods of a one, two, and perhaps up to four years as \u201cguest professors.\u201d This limits opportunities for scholars from all foreign countries. An important legal basis for this practice was the requirement that \u201cregular\u201d (\u201cordentliche\u201d) professors must be civil servants, without the right to strike. Only German citizens can be employed as civil servants. As a Privatdozent, and simultaneously, until 2006, a senior research fellow, Fang was not only permanently engaged in research while also teaching courses at the Dept. of Chinese Literature. As noted already, he was likewise very active at the Department of Communication Theory in Trier.See the German-language online journal TELEPOLIS, on Aug. 11, 2003, regarding Weigui Fang\u2019s role as a researcher engaged in the research project The Internet in China (\"Das Internet in China\") supported by both the Dept. of Chinese Literature and the Dept. of Media Science of the University of Trier. - URL https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Du-bist-ein-286-3430589.html - Accessed Nov 23, 2017. This work led to Fang's book Das Internet und China that was discussed in the Swiss daily Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, mentioned by Der Spiegel, and reviewed in the Swiss journal Der Bund.In his book review of Das Internet und China (Hanover, Germany: Heise, 2004), Nick L\u00fcthi writes, \u201cBei der Lekt\u00fcre stellt sich heraus, dass sich der Autor der [\u2026] Problemzonen durchaus bewusst ist, sich aber davor h\u00fctet, einen anprangernden Ton anzuschlagen \u2013 im Wissen, dass manche der denunzierten Missst\u00e4nde Folge einer vielschichtigen Gemengelage sind.\u201d Nick L\u00fcthi, \u201cHinter dem Grossen Firewall: Internet-Boom in China: Sars hat dem E-Business weiteren Schub verliehen\u201d, in: Der Bund (Bern, Switzerland), Aug. 4, 2004, p.35.

Hamburg: GIGA, Springer VS, 2012. ; (eBook) ==Career in China== When Fang returned to China in 2006, Professor Wolfgang Kubin saw \"a good scholar\" leaving the country (i.e., Germany) and regretted this very much.Prof. Wolfgang Kubin wrote, \u201cGute Wissenschaftler verlassen bekanntlich Deutschland, und so ist auch der hochtalentierte Sinologe Fang Weigui \u65b9\u7ef4\u89c4, der in Deutschland promoviert worden ist und sich daselbst auch habilitiert hat, nach China zur\u00fcckgekehrt.\u201d In English: \u201cIt is a well-known fact that good scholars are leaving Germany, and thus, the highly talented sinologist Fang Weigui, who obtained a Ph.D. in Germany and accomplished his \u201chabilitation\u201d in this country, has returned to China.\u201d See Wolfgang Kubin, review of Weigui Fang (ed.), Den Kranich fragen. 155 Gedichte von Bai Juyi.

Subsequent to his return to his native country in 2006, Fang soon became a professor at the School of Chinese Language and Literature of Beijing Normal University, and a researcher at the Center for Literary and Art Studies. Since 2012, he has been a Chiangjiang Scholar and Distinguished Professor.See the text entitled \u201dFang Weigui \u65b9\u7ef4\u89c4\u201d, ibid., http://wxy.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/wyxyjs/91270.html Accessed Nov 23, 2017. His main research focus is on comparative poetics, comparative literature, history of concepts, sociology of literature, and Chinese literature written abroad. Among the books written or edited by Fang since 2006, it is necessary to mention Wenxue Shehuixue Xinbian, a new compilation of texts concerning approaches to the sociology of literature, edited and commented by him, and published by Beijing Normal University Press. When this book appeared in print in 2011, it was discussed in the journal China Reading Weekly (Chine lecture hebdomadaire).See Li Jiajia, \u00ab \u4e3a \u2018\u6587\u5b66\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u2019 \u5408\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d / Wei wenxue shehui xue heli dingwei \u00bb (Rational positioning of sociology of literature), in: \u4e2d\u534e\u8bfb\u4e66\u62a5Zhonghua dushu bao (Chine lecture hebdomadaire), May 23, 2012, p. 6. \u2013 Printed publication; also online: .

In addition to the books he wrote or edited and his scholarly articles, Fang also organized several international scholarly conferences at Beijing Normal University (BNU) in recent years under the general heading \"Ideas and methods\" (Sixiang yu fangfa); thus for instance a conference focused on the dialogue between the East and the West that was announced under the heading: \u00ab Sixiang yu Fangfa: Quanqiuhua Shidai Zhongxi Duihua de Keneng / Id\u00e9es et m\u00e9thodes: Possibilit\u00e9s d'un dialogue sino-occidental \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de la mondialisation / Ideas and methods: Possibilties of a Chinese-Western Dialogue in the Era of Globalization \u00bb. A book published under the same title that presents many contributions by participating scholars was edited by Fang and published by Peking University Press in 2014. A year later, Fang organized the conference \u00ab Sixiang yu Fangfa: Jindai Zhongguo de Wenhua Zhengzhi et Zhishi Jiangou\" / Id\u00e9es et m\u00e9thodes: Politique culturelle et construction des connaissances modernes dans la Chine moderne / Ideas and methods : Cultural politics and the construction of modern knowledge in modern China \u00bb.

Their contributions were published in 2018 by Palgrave Macmillan in the book Tensions in World Literature : Between the Local and the Universal, edited and with a long introduction by Weigui Fang that reveals his dedication to an approach inspired by conceptual history as well as his universalist commitment to the dialogue between nations. In 2018, the contributions of the foreign and Chinese scholars discussing World Literature, world literatures, and global literature were also published by Peking University Press in Chinese, in addition to the English version published by Palgrave Macmillan. Subsequent to the above mentioned conference on world literature organized by Fang in 2015, two other conferences have been organized by him at BNU: \\- Sixiang yu fangfa: Lishi Zhongguo de Nei yu Wai / Ideas and Methods: Changing Order, Interlaced Civilizations: Inside and Outside of the historical China.

October 27\u201329, 2018. In 2019, Palgrave Macmillan published Fang's book Modern Notions of Civilization and Culture in China. As Prof. Wang (Academia Sinica, Taipei) noted, Fang discusses in this book \"the paradigm shift and conceptual changes surrounding the wenming concept in the intellectual history of modern China.\"Excerpt of the statement by Prof. Fansen Wang, vice-pr\u00e9sidente, Academia Sinica, Taipei, published on the back cover of Fang\u2019s book. In addition to ten monographical studies (in German, English, and Chinese), Weigui Fang has also edited eight books. He is the translator of four books (from German to Chinese, and from Chinese to German) and he has also published more than one hundred scholarly articles.See the text entitled\u201dFang Weigui \u65b9\u7ef4\u89c4\u201d, ibid. .

The well-known sinologist Wolfgang Kubin praised Fang on several occasions. Thus he called him a \"highly talented sinologist\" when he reviewed Fang's translation of 155 poems by the Classical Chinese poet Bai Juyi).See Wolfgang Kubin\u2018s book review of Den Kranich fragen. 155 Gedichte von Bai Juyi (Asking the Crane; 155 poems by Bai Juyi), ed. by Weigui Fang, in the scholarly journal ORIENTIERUNGEN.

Wolfgang Kubin refers to this translation again in his book Die chinesische Dichtkunst. (Chinese Art of Poetry), Munich: Saur, 2002. The German sinologist Karl-Heinz Pohl, professor emeritus of the University of Trier, also praised Fang on several occasions. In his preface to the book Den Kranich fragen (Asking the Crane, 155 poems of Bai Juyi), he applauds Fang's \"superior art of translation\"In German: \u201csouver\u00e4ne \u00dcbersetzungkunst\u201d.

As Prof. Pohl notes, Fang is a not only a \"Distinguished Professor\" at the School of Chinese Language and Literature of Beijing Normal University in China but also Changjiang Scholar of the Ministry of Education of China.\u201dChangjiang scholar\u201d is a honorific title. See also the text entitled \u201dFang Weigui \u65b9\u7ef4\u89c4\u201d, published by the School of Chinese Language and Literature, Beijing Normal University, in: BNU website http://wxy.bnu.edu.cn/szdw/wyxyjs/91270.html Accessed Nov 23, 2017. He is simultaneously the Director of the Center for Literature and the History of Ideas at BNU. Fang is widely recognized as one of the most significant experts focused on the history of ideas in China. He is not only known as a specialist in this field in China but also abroad. The journal Archiv orient\u00e1ln\u00ed / Revue trimestrielle des \u00e9tudes africaines et asiatiques (vol. 71, no. 1, February 2003, p. 209\\. ISSN 0044-8699), published by the Oriental Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences praised his article \"Yi, yang, xi, wai and other terms: The Transition from Barbarian to Foreigner in Late Imperial China\" by stating : \"This study is an excellent example of the role of lexicology\" if it is practiced with \"such competence.\"See: Archiv orient\u00e1ln\u00ed / Quarterly Journal of African and Asian Studies, T. 71, no. 1, fevrier 2003, p. 209. \u2013 Like similar articles by Fang, his essay on yi, yang, xi, wai and other terms was used by numerous authors. R.J. Smith refers to it in his book The Qing Dynasty and Traditional Chinese Culture. Lantham; Boulder; New York; London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2015. ; 978-1-4422-2194-9. It is also mentioned in Sufen Sophia Lai\u2019s article \u201cRacial Discourse and Utopian Visions in Nineteenth Century China\u201d that forms part of the book Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Occidental and Eastern constructions, edited by Red Kowner and Walter Demel. Brill: Leiden, 2012, p. 327-350. (hardcover); 978-90-04-23741-4 (e-book). Fang\u2019s essay on the change the concepts of yi, yang, xi and wai underwent was also discussed in Monumenta Serica / Journal of Oriental Studies, T. 53 (2005), p.254. It is obvious that Fang's interest in the history of concepts has been alive for many years already. In fact, \"Fang became one of the first scholars in China to focus on the history of concepts when his research essay on changing notions of civilization and culture in modern China was published in 1999,\" as Prof. Fansen Wang, Vice-president of the Academia Sinica in Taipei, recently noted.See the back cover of the book Modern Notions of Civilization and Culture in China, London ; New York ; Singapore : Palgrave Macmillan, 2019. Fang's research on the evolution (or changing history) of the image of China in German literature found wide reception among colleagues in East Asia and in the West.As a consequence, Fang was invited to scholarly conferences in Japan, South Korea, France, etc. \u2013 The French scholars Marie Doll\u00e9 and Genevi\u00e8ve Espagne write : \u00ab FANG WEIGUI [\u2026] explique qu\u2019au XIXe si\u00e8cle des personnalit\u00e9s de premier plan infl\u00e9chissent nettement la r\u00e9ception allemande et fran\u00e7aise de la culture chinoise dans le sens du d\u00e9dain et de la d\u00e9formation. \u00c0 la suite de Montesquieu, Rousseau, Herder qui, d\u00e8s le XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, avaient laiss\u00e9 entendre leurs voix discordantes au milieu d\u2019un discours globalement sinophile, Hegel, Schelling et Marx donnent \u00e0 leur pens\u00e9e une orientation sinophobe.
