When he was a child, his family moved to Australia, where he attended the Melbourne Grammar School, before returning to England where he attended The Leys School. He made his debut in first-class cricket for London County against Ireland at Crystal Palace in 1902. He played for London County until 1904, making eight appearances. He made two first-class appearances for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University in 1905, before playing for the Gentlemen of England against Surrey in 1906.
