    "text": "David Onri Anderson is a Tennessee-born painter, musician and curator of French/Algerian ancestry, who emerged from the Nashville arts community in the mid-1990s. His large scale paintings are heavily influenced by nature, eastern Tantra artwork and Cosmic Philosophy and are sometimes accompanied by installation elements such as raw earth. His works frequently explore the spaces between oneness and variation. In 2016, he was awarded the Anny Gowa Purchase Award from Watkins College of Art, Design & Film and in 2017 considered by the publication Nashville Scene as Best Emerging Painter. In early 2019, the artist's musical project, the metal-influenced Dream pop band called Onri (with fellow members Aaron Harper and Zack Rafuls), released their sixteen-track debut album, \"Bed Bop\". ==Solo exhibitions== *2019 Patrick Painter Gallery \u201cApple Core Peace Temple\u201d *2018 \"Earthbound\" Elephant Gallery, Nashville *2017 \"Rice, Beans & Incense\" Atlanta Contemporary, Atlanta *2017 \"I\u2019m So Glad I Got My Own\" (Natural High), Fluorescent Gallery, Atlanta HUM, *2017 The Browsing Room, Nashville *2016 Paper Mind, Bijan Ferdwosi, Nashville *2016 \"What\u2019s In My Soup?\" BFA Thesis Show, Brownlee O.
