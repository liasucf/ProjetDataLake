Other problems includes an out-of-date asset list and loss of insurance paperwork. Local residents called for the council to be disbanded at a public meeting in April 2018. The suspension of the clerk on full pay, for alleged misuse of his work computer, was said to be on the verge of bankrupting the council by early 2019. A by- election took place on 15 March 2018 following the resignation of a councillor. It was won by retired police officer, Steve Oaten. Councillor Oaten became chairman of the community council, but resigned in February 2019 citing \"the overbearing conduct and behaviour\" of some councillors and saying the council needed \"a few new faces\". ===Vale of Glamorgan Council=== Sully and Lavernock is in the electoral ward of Sully for elections to the Vale of Glamorgan Council.
