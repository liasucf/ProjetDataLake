    "text": "Rock 'N' America was an American sketch comedy and music video show. The series opening credits theme song was \"(You Can Still) Rock in America\" by Night Ranger. In the middle of the series run, the original series host Rick Ducommun was replaced by Frazer Smith. The opening and ending credit music changed also, using a portion of the song Automatic Sighs (falsely credited as \"Automatic Signs\" during the end credits) by the band Strange Advance off their album Worlds Away. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980s American sketch comedy television series Category:1980s American satirical television series Category:1980s American musical comedy television series Category:1984 American television series debuts Category:English-language television shows ",
