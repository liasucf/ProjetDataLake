He first gained notice when an influential Los Angeles DJ, Nic Harcourt, began playing his music on the radio station KCRW. It led to much interest from the LA music industry, which Murdoch largely ignored, turning down advances from record labels and opting to release his music independently. ==Four Songs== He self-released the EP Four Songs through independent record stores and website CD Baby in November 2002.Langer, Andy (December 2003) \"(Derek Sivers)\".

Time Without Consequence peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. On 9 June 2006, Murdoch began a 34-city tour in conjunction with the Coalition of Independent Music Stores, with most bookings at independent record stores. The album became one of the most licensed albums of the decade, receiving placements on dozens of films and television shows: * \"Orange Sky\" appeared in The O.C., House, Prison Break, Ugly Betty, Dirty Sexy Money, Ladder 49, Suburgatory, and Southland, as well as in promotions for Oscar nominated foreign film, Paradise Now and a Honda commercial. * \"Home\" appeared in a season 2 episode of Prison Break. * \"All My Days\" was featured in The O.C., Grey's Anatomy, Scrubs, Without a Trace, Stargate Universe, Sense8, and a promo for Southland.

Three of these were unreleased at the time; \"Towards the Sun\" and \"Crinan Wood\" were later released on Murdoch's 2011 album \"\"Towards the Sun\". * Several songs were used in a surfing documentary One California Day. \"Crinan Wood\" was used in the episode Chuck Versus the Masquerade from the show Chuck. ==Career== In the spring of 2009, Murdoch embarked on a rare US headlining tour, during which he distributed an early version of a new album entitled Towards the Sun in a limited edition packaged in a hand-printed, cardboard sleeve. Recent bookings by Murdoch include two concerts in Berlin, one small club appearance and a second as part of the City Slang label's 20th anniversary. In February 2011, he performed in New York City as part of Lincoln Center's prestigious \"American Songbook Series\". Afterwards, he went on a sold-out tour of major markets throughout North America. (i.e. Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Chicago, Minneapolis.) 2011 also saw the official release of his third recording, \"Towards The Sun\". ==Critical reception== Murdoch is compared to the late British singer-songwriter Nick Drake. His first album Time Without Consequence was met with wide critical praise, gaining him five stars with Alternative Press as well as placing him on Rolling Stone's Top Ten Artists list. His newest release Towards the Sun is gathering higher praise still in both the US and in Europe. PopMatters, giving the record a 9/10 calls Murdoch's performance \"hauntingly beautiful\" and \"heartbreakingly lovely\". Q magazine in the UK give the record four stars with this to say: \"Acoustic troubadour makes stunning second outing. Anyone who harps on about how the songwriters of today don't match up to those of yesteryear should be directed to this remarkable second record.\" ==Discography== ===LPs=== * Time Without Consequence, 2006 * Towards the Sun, 2009 ===Extended Plays=== * Four Songs, 2002 (EP) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * CNN: The 'Britney' backlash: Budding songwriter rejects record contract * Alexi Murdoch at NPR Music Category:1973 births Category:British male singers Category:British songwriters Category:British singer-songwriters Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:British people of Greek descent Category:British people of French descent Category:British expatriates in the United States Category:Musicians from London Category:Living people Category:Duke University alumni Category:21st-century British singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
