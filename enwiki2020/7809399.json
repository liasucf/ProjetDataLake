    "text": "In mathematics, a topological space X is called countably generated if the topology of X is determined by the countable sets in a similar way as the topology of a sequential space (or a Fr\u00e9chet space) by the convergent sequences. The countable generated spaces are precisely the spaces having countable tightness - therefore the name countably tight is used as well. ==Definition== A topological space X is called countably generated if V is closed in X whenever for each countable subspace U of X the set V \\cap U is closed in U. Equivalently, X is countably generated if and only if the closure of any A \\subset X equals the union of closures of all countable subsets of A. ==Countable fan tightness== A topological space X has countable fan tightness if for every point x\\in X and every sequence A_1,A_2,\\ldots of subsets of the space X such that x\\in\\bigcap_n\\overline{A_n} , there are finite set B_1\\subset A_1, B_2\\subset A_2,\\ldots such that x\\in \\overline{\\bigcup_nB_n}. A topological space X has countable strong fan tightness if for every point x\\in X and every sequence A_1,A_2,\\ldots of subsets of the space X such that x\\in\\bigcap_n\\overline{A_n} , there are points x_1\\subset A_1, x_2\\subset A_2,\\ldots such that x\\in \\overline{\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots\\\\}}. Every strong Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space has strong countable fan tightness. ==Properties== A quotient of countably generated space is again countably generated. Similarly, a topological sum of countably generated spaces is countably generated. Therefore the countably generated spaces form a coreflective subcategory of the category of topological spaces. They are the coreflective hull of all countable spaces. Any subspace of a countably generated space is again countably generated. ==Examples== Every sequential space (in particular, every metrizable space) is countably generated. An example of a space which is countably generated but not sequential can be obtained, for instance, as a subspace of Arens\u2013Fort space. ==See also== * The concept of finitely generated space is related to this notion. * Tightness is a cardinal function related to countably generated spaces and their generalizations. ==External links== * A Glossary of Definitions from General Topology * https://web.archive.org/web/20040917084107/http://thales.doa.fmph.uniba.sk/density/pages/slides/sleziak/paper.pdf ==References== * Category:General topology ",
