It is located in eastern part of the Silesian Voivodeship, on the Czarna Przemsza and Bia\u0142a Przemsza rivers (tributaries of the Vistula, see Przemsza). Even though D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, it now is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship (since 1999), and previously (1975\u20131999) it was in Katowice Voivodeship. D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation \u2013 Katowice urban area, and within a greater silesian metropolitan area populated by about 5.2 million people.European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) The population of the city itself is 119,373 (Dec 2019). ==Area and districts== D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza is the largest city of the province and the 9th largest in Poland in terms of territory, with total area of 188 square kilometers. The city lies among the hills, at 258 to 390 meters above sea level. D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza borders B\u0119dzin County, Zawiercie County, Olkusz County and the city of Sosnowiec. The city is divided into several districts: Antoni\u00f3w, B\u0142\u0119d\u00f3w, Bugaj, Centrum, Dziewi\u0105ty, Go\u0142on\u00f3g, Korzeniec, Ku\u017aniczka Nowa, \u0141azy B\u0142\u0119dowskie, \u0141\u0119ka, \u0141\u0119knice, \u0141osie\u0144, Marianki, Mydlice, Okradzion\u00f3w, Piek\u0142o, Ratanice, Reden, Sikorka, Strzemieszyce Ma\u0142e, Strzemieszyce Wielkie, Trzebies\u0142awice, Trzydziesty, Tucznawa, Ujejsce, Z\u0105bkowice. Furthermore, in 1977\u20131984 the town of S\u0142awk\u00f3w was a district of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza. The place name D\u0105browa, is derived from the Polish word d\u0105b (oak), and denotes an oak grove, as the territory of the original village is believed to have been covered by oak forests back in the early days of its existence. From the 19th century, the settlement grew to be an important coal mining center, and its name was supplemented by the adjective G\u00f3rnicza (which refers to mining) in 1919, to distinguish it from such towns, as D\u0105browa Tarnowska and D\u0105browa Bia\u0142ostocka. Church in D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza Museum ==History== In the first half of the 18th century D\u0105browa was a small agricultural settlement belonging to the B\u0119dzin parish of Lesser Poland's Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship. First mentioned on 25 July 1726, when parish priest of Holy Trinity Church at B\u0119dzin noted a woman named Anna Lisowa from D\u0105browa. According to the 1787 census of the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w, the settlement numbered 184 inhabitants. The districts of D\u0105browa, which for centuries had been separate villages, are much older. Trzebieslawice was first mentioned in the 12th century, B\u0142\u0119dow was mentioned by Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c in the year 1220, Strzemieszyce and Ujejsce were mentioned in the 14th century, Go\u0142on\u00f3g in the 15th century, while Z\u0105bkowice was described by Jan D\u0142ugosz. Church in Strzemieszyce Wielkie After the Third Partition of Poland (1795) D\u0105browa was incorporated into the Prussian province of New Silesia. The Prussians discovered rich deposits of coal here and the first coal mine was established by Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden in 1796. In 1799, first detailed map of this area was created, on which a settlement called Stara D\u0105browa is presented. It was located along a road from Krak\u00f3w to Upper Silesia. The coal mine, established by Friedrich Reden, attracted workers, and a settlement was soon established around it. In 1815, D\u0105browa was annexed by Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1846, the Cieszkowski Coal Mine was opened, named after J\u00f3zef Cieszkowski. The Zinc Plant Konstanty operated as early as 1823, and the Huta Bankowa steel works, which is still in operation, was built in D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza in 1834. First primary school was opened in 1820, and first Roman Catholic church of St. Alexander was built in the 1870s. In 1909 the gmina of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza was established by Tsarist authorities. Even though its population reached 30,000, the Russians were reluctant to grant D\u0105browa town charter, so it remained a village until 18 August 1916, when Austrian authorities, which during World War I occupied southern part of Congress Poland, agreed to establish the town. In the Second Polish Republic, D\u0105browa belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, and during World War II it was annexed into the Third Reich, as part of the Upper Silesia Province. Together with whole Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie, the city was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship after World War II, in 1945. The 1970s saw the construction of the Katowice Steelworks, which is nowadays the biggest steel producing plant in Poland, after privatization owned by ArcelorMittal. In the 1970s the town expanded territorially and economically. In 1975 and 1977 the neighboring localities of Strzemieszyce Ma\u0142e, Strzemieszyce Wielkie, Z\u0105bkowice and others became suburbanized. The population of D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza reached its peak in 1982 with 152,373 inhabitants. In the 1990s all local coal mines were closed, because of lack of coal. But the oldest part of the town Reden still exists.
