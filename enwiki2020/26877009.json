During the first war of independence, Heidelberg served as capital of the South African Republic, from 1880 to 1883. Lesedi is a Sesotho word meaning \"light\". The name was decided upon because the municipality represents the light of the area. South African Languages - Place names == Politics == The municipal council consists of twenty-six members elected by mixed-member proportional representation. Thirteen councillors are elected by first-past-the-post voting in thirteen wards, while the remaining thirteen are chosen from party lists so that the total number of party representatives is proportional to the number of votes received. In the election of 3 August 2016 the African National Congress (ANC) won a majority of seats on the council. The planned abolition of the Lesedi, and its absorption into Ekurhuleni after the 2016 municipal elections, was blocked by the High Court of South Africa in 2015. The following table shows the results of the election. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Party !!colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| Votes !!colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| Seats |- !
