Artwork by Tom Ashlee featuring Ellie Hook. == Critical reception == MTV Iggy writes, \"Their self-titled album, out March 15, is exploding with flashy electropop enthusiasm\" and \"Keyboardist Tim Estherby\u2019s opening synth is like a beam of fluorescent light announcing frontman Sam Hammond's zealous call for youthful abandon; surrender is inevitable, and pretty blissful. 'Honey' serves a similarly sized slice of shimmery liberation, and 'Diamonds' is as crystalline as its name implies\" == Track listing == ==References== Category:2015 debut albums ",
