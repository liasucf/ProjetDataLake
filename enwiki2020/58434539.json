    "text": "==Amphibian== *Phylum: Chordata *Class: Amphibia Amphibians are tetrapod animals from the class Amphibia comprising toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and caecilians. They have an amphibious lifestyle, where the larvae are aquatic. Skin is generally soft and with glands. They show three type of respiration through moist skin, buccal cavity and lungs. Caecilians are limbless amphibians, whereas other amphibians have short limbs. Amphibians lay cluster of eggs as egg masses closer to a water body and show an external fertilization. About 20 species of amphibians are found in Czech Republic. The low numbers is due to cold climate, where both amphibians and reptiles are poikilothermic animals they cannot survive in very cold environments. This is a list of amphibians and reptiles found in Czech Republic. ===Order: Caudata - Salamanders and allies=== ====Family: Salamandridae - True salamanders & Newts==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Palmate newt 200px | Lissotriton helveticus | Least Concern |- |Carpathian newt 200px |Lissotriton montandoni | Least Concern |- |Smooth newt 200px |Lissotriton vulgaris | Least Concern |- |Alpine newt 200px |Ichthyosaura alpestris | Least Concern |- |Fire salamander 200px |Salamandra salamandra | Least Concern |- |Italian crested newt 200px |Triturus carnifex | Least Concern |- |Northern crested newt 200px |Triturus cristatus | Least Concern |- |Danube crested newt 200px |Triturus dobrogicus | Near Threatened |} ===Order: Anura - Frogs and toads=== ====Family: Bombinatoridae - Fire-bellied toads==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |European fire- bellied toad 200px |Bombina bombina | Least Concern |- |Yellow-bellied toad 200px |Bombina variegata | Least Concern |} ====Family: Bufonidae - Tree toads==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Common toad 200px |Bufo bufo | Least Concern |- |European green toad 200px |Bufo viridis | Least Concern |- |Natterjack toad 200px |Epidalea calamita | Least Concern |} ====Family: Hylidae - Tree frogs==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |European tree frog 200px |Hyla arborea | Least Concern |} ====Family: Pelobatidae - Spadefoot toads==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |European common spadefoot 200px |Pelobates fuscus | Least Concern |} ====Family: Ranidae - True frogs==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Marsh frog 200px |Pelophylax ridibundus | Least Concern |- |Edible frog 200px |Pelophylax kl. esculentus | Least Concern |- |Pool frog 200px |Pelophylax lessonae | Least Concern |- |Moor frog 200px |Rana arvalis | Least Concern |- |Agile frog 200px |Rana dalmatina | Least Concern |- |European grass frog 200px |Rana temporaria | Least Concern |} ==Reptile== *Phylum: Chordata *Class: Reptilia Reptiles are tetrapod animals from the class Reptilia comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. Reptiles are vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades -- the fetus develops within the mother, contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. There are about 16 species of reptiles found in Czech republic. The only venomous snake is the European adder. ===Order: Testudines - Turtles=== ====Family: Emydidae - Terrapins==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |European pond turtle 200px |Emys orbicularis | Near Threatened |- |Pond slider 200px |Trachemys scripta | Least Concern (Introduced) |} ===Order: Squamata - Scaled reptiles=== ====Family: Anguidae==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Eastern slowworm |Anguis colchica | Least Concern |- |Common slowworm 200px |Anguis fragilis | Least Concern |} ====Family: Lacertidae - True lizards==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Sand lizard 200px |Lacerta agilis | Least Concern |- |European green lizard 200px |Lacerta viridis | Least Concern |- |Common wall lizard 200px |Podarcis muralis | Least Concern |- |Viviparous lizard 200px |Zootoca vivipara | Least Concern |} ====Suborder: Serpentes - Snakes==== ====Family: Colubridae - Colubrids==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |Smooth snake 200px |Coronella austriaca | Least Concern |- |Grass snake 200px |Natrix natrix | Least Concern |- |Dice snake 200px |Natrix tessellata | Least Concern |- |Aesculapian snake 200px |Zamenis longissimus | Least Concern |} ====Family: Viperidae - Vipers==== {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=20% | Binomial !width=20% | Status |- |European adder 200px |Vipera berus | Least Concern |} ==References== ==External links== Reptiles Amphibians Reptiles Amphibians ",
