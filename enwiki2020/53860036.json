It was published by Sahitya Academy in 1965, with a reprint in 1994. The translation is in prose and is not a direct translation from Tamil but based on English translations of the original. According to the then Additional Secretary to Government of Tamil Nadu, H. K. Ghazim, \u201cHis [Suhrawardy\u2019s] is a fine piece of work in chaste Urdu. Apart from its own literary merit, the work is faithful to the original.\u201d The second translation was made in verse by poet Mukhtar Badri in 2001 and was published in Chennai under the title Lafz lafz gohar. ==See also== * Tirukkural translations * List of Tirukkural translations by language == Notes == == Bibliography== * Ghazi, H.
