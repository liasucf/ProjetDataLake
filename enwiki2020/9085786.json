    "text": "Umm al Binni lake is a mostly dry lake within the Central Marshes in Maysan Governorate in southern Iraq. The 3.4 km (2.11 miles) wide lake is approximately 45 km northwest of the Tigris\u2013Euphrates confluence. Because of its shape, location, and other details, it has been conjectured to represent an impact crater. == Evidence as an impact crater == Using satellite imagery, Sharad Master suggests the 3.4 km diameter dry lake may be an impact crater based on its nearly circular, slightly polygonal rim shape, and contrasting shape to other lakes in the region. As to its origin, he rules out karst topography, salt doming, tectonic deformation, and igneous intrusion as well as possible bombing or man-made origins. Some structures may initially be found through satellite remote sensing and later established as impact craters like the recently confirmed Santa Marta crater found by Master and J. Heymann.Master, S.; Heymann, J (2000). A Possible New Impact Structure near Gilbu\u00e9s in Piau\u00ed Province, Northeastern Brazil, Meteoritics & Planetary Science, vol. 35, Supplement, p.A105A. P. Cr\u00f3sta and M. A. Vasconcelos (2013). Confirmation Of The Impact Origin Of The Santa Marta Crater, Brazil, 76th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting == Details and historical context == Master estimates the age of the crater to be less than 5000 years old, or between 2000\u22123000 BC, due to the deposition of sediments of the Tigris- Euphrates plain as a result of the 130\u2013150 km seaward progradation of the Persian Gulf during that time period. Some relate this apparent impact site to the 2350 BC Middle East anomaly.Courty M-A (1998) Causes and effects of the 2350 BC Middle East anomaly evidenced by micro-debris fallout, surface combustion and soil explosion.

British Archaeol Reports S728, Archaeopress, OxfordGoogle search A lack of writings describing this event by well-known authors like Herodotus (484\u2013425 BC) and Nearchus (360\u2013300 BC) or later historians implies the impact may have occurred much earlier, between 2000\u22123000 BC. During this time period, the Al Amarah region was approximately 10 m. deep under the Persian Gulf. Impact-induced tsunamis would have devastated coastal Sumerian cities. This may provide an alternate origin of the 2.6 m sediment layer discovered during an excavation of the Sumerian city of Ur by Leonard Woolley in 1922-1934. Descriptive passages in The Epic of Gilgamesh (circa 1600\u20131800 BC) may describe such an impact and tsunami, suggesting a link to the Sumerian Deluge: == Climate change and impact effects == It has been proposed that sudden climate changes and catastrophic events around 2200 BCE (including the collapse of the Sumerian civilisation) could be linked to a comet or asteroid impact. Master has conjectured that the alleged Umm al Binni impact could be responsible for this catastrophe, producing the energy equivalent to thousands of Hiroshima-sized bombs. Using equations describing impact effects based on work from Collins et al., Shoemaker, Glasstone & Dolan and others, Hamacher determined that an impacting bolide would have produced energy in the range of 190 to 750 megatons of TNT (for an asteroid and comet impact, respectively). For comparison, the Tunguska event was estimated to have an explosive force of about 10-15 megatons. Hamacher's result is dependent on the impactor's density, size, and impact velocity. In order to produce an impact crater with the dimensions of Umm al Binni lake, a Ni-Fe asteroid (density = 7860 kg/m^3, v = 15 km/s) would have been around 100 m in diameter while a comet (density = 500 kg/m^3, v = 25 km/s) would have been between 200 and 300 m in diameter. The resulting impact effects would have caused massive devastation to an area thousands of square kilometres in size, but would not have been sufficient on its own to have caused the wide- scale damage seen at distances exceeding ~100 kilometers from the impact and thus could not be responsible for many of the more distant devastating effects on its own. Although a large mount of circumstantial evidence has been published in the literature suggesting Umm al Binni is an impact crater, no on-site analysis has been done, primarily due to the current volatile and dangerous situation in Iraq. Therefore, Umm al Binni lake remains a possible, albeit unconfirmed, impact structure. ==See also== * 4.2 kiloyear event, c. 2200 BC * 2350 BC Middle East Anomaly * Burckle crater * Great Flood (China), c. 2300 BC * List of possible impact structures on Earth * Tunguska event ==External links== *Google Earth view (taken when the lake was completely dry) == References == Category:Lakes of Iraq Category:Holocene impact craters Category:Possible impact craters on Earth ",
