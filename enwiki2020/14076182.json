    "text": "Thomas Hands (4 January 1870 \u2013 after 1900) was an English professional footballer who played as an outside left. He played 134 games for Small Heath in the Football Alliance and the Football League. Born in Small Heath, Birmingham, Hands played for several clubs in the local area before signing for Small Heath, then playing in the Football Alliance, in December 1890. He went on to make nearly 150 appearances for the club. The strength of Hands's game lay in his speed. In Small Heath's first Football League season, in which they won the inaugural Second Division championship, he was part of a forward line who all reached double figures of goals scored. He also contributed to their runners-up spot and promotion to the First Division the following year, and played for a further two years in the top flight. At the end of the 1895\u201396 season, he walked out of the club over a dispute about money and never played league football again. ==References== * Category:1870 births Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Year of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:People from Small Heath, Birmingham Category:Football Alliance players ",
