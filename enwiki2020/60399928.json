The band was raised in November 1859 as part the Sirmoor Rifle Regiment, originally consisting of 16 Bandsmen and one with the rank of Naik who serves as bandmaster. Certain changes in 1886 (such as the raising of a new 2nd Battalion) allowed for an expansion of the existing band. The two bands often cooperated with each other in both of their musical and operational duties (bandsmen also served as stretcher bearers and medical personnel on the battlefield). The army sanctioned the training of a new band in 1949, with 56 recruits beginning their army service. Within a year of that decision, a brigade staff band was established, leaving the unit with two separate military bands. At the time, ad hoc instruction and education was given by British bandmasters and acclaimed musicians of working for the army, which would end in May 1951. The two bands routine continued for over a decade until the two bands were amalgamated because of financial considerations.
