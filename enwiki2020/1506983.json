    "text": "The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (also known as the KCAs or Kids' Choice) is an annual American children's awards ceremony show that is produced by Nickelodeon. Usually held on a Saturday night in late March or early April, the show honors the year's biggest television, movie, and music acts as voted by viewers worldwide of Nickelodeon networks. Winners receive a hollow orange blimp figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984\u20132009 era, which also functions as a kaleidoscope. The show features numerous celebrity guests and musical acts. Since 2002, slime stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCAs also host live entertainment. It has also been known to overwhelmingly cover people with the network's trademark green slime. The series SpongeBob SquarePants has won the most KCA awards, with seventeen overall through the series' run. Individually, Selena Gomez has won the most trophies with eleven, followed by Will Smith (10) and Adam Sandler (9). Whoopi Goldberg is the only person to have won a Kids' Choice Award, along with the mainstream \"EGOT\" combination of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Rosie O'Donnell has hosted the show most times (8), followed by Jack Black (3), and John Cena (2). ==History== Alan Goodman, Albie Hecht, and Fred Seibert created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a show called The Big Ballot in 1987, named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a thank you video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform. Hecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash (Corey McPherson Nash, Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York).The Nickelodeon Logo, The Fred/Alan Archive The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990. The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface. As the Internet came into widespread use, the voting eventually moved from a combination of 900 number telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at Pizza Hut locations, to being conducted exclusively on the network's website, and included text messaging by 2007. During the early years of Internet voting, there were several problems, including the digital equivalent of ballot stuffing and adult voting. As a result, a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick.com account is allowed (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only rather than a screen name, by creating an account with a false age, or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an iPhone application and mobile browser voting were also added. The 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called \"The Big Green Help Award\" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to Leonardo DiCaprio. For the 2010 awards, \"The Big Green Help\" award was renamed \"The Big Help\" award, with First Lady Michelle Obama winning the first award under the rename. Unlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner rather than a traditional envelope. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers, and even a foot. Voting became available for Canadians in time for the 2010 ceremony, owing to the inauguration of Nickelodeon's Canadian service in November 2009. In June 2010, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards for Mexico.kicks Choice Awards Mexico 2010 Other countries with their own Kids' Choice Awards include Brazil, United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia, which are either fully original local productions, or inserted as continuity during their broadcast of the American ceremony. The Australian Kids' Choice Awards had its last local ceremony in 2012. In August 2011, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards event for Argentina. In June 2014, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards event for Colombia. The 2020 ceremony was the first ceremony to be held in a virtual format, a change that was necessary in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. ==Awards== This table shows the awards from the past.

Previous ceremonies have been held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, the Hollywood Bowl, the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, and Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, but mostly at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus. After renovations to Pauley beginning in 2011, the show was moved to the Galen Center at USC;Associated Press, UCLA to renovate famous court, ESPN, May 11, 2010 it was expected to be a temporary home, but the network retained Galen for the 2012-14 ceremonies due to the construction of the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference and Guest Center, making it difficult to have the \"Orange Carpet\"; the smaller Kids' Choice Sports had its first ceremony in 2014 at Pauley. For the 2015 and 2016 shows, the ceremony occurred at the remodeled Forum in Inglewood, California. Between the 2017 and 2019 shows, the venue alternated between the Galen Center and The Forum. The 2020 awards, previously scheduled for March 22, were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; a spokesperson said that Nickelodeon \"will have further information about a new date in the future.\" The ceremony was later moved to May 2 to be held virtually. The 2020 show was planned to serve as a tie-in with Nickelodeon's Slimefest event. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Location |- |1988 |rowspan=3| Universal Studios Hollywood |- |1989 |- |1990 |- |1991 |Pauley Pavilion |- |1992 |Universal Studios Hollywood |- |1994 |Pantages Theatre Universal Studios Florida |- |1995 |Barker Hangar |- |1996 |Universal Pictures |- |1997 |Grand Olympic Auditorium |- |1998 |rowspan=2| Pauley Pavilion |- |1999 |- |2000 |Hollywood Bowl |- |2001 |rowspan=3| Barker Hangar |- |2002 |- |2003 |- |2004 |rowspan=7| Pauley Pavilion |- |2005 |- |2006 |- |2007 |- |2008 |- |2009 |- |2010 |- |2011 |rowspan=4| Galen Center |- |2012 |- |2013 |- |2014 |- |2015 |rowspan=2| The Forum |- |2016 |- |2017 |Galen Center |- |2018 |The Forum |- |2019 |Galen Center |- |2020 |Virtual show |} Note ==Ceremony hosts== The 1987 Big Ballot studio show was unhosted. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Initially, the award was chosen by the kids from a slate of nominees. Actors, athletes and singers were all eligible for the award, with ballots containing nominees from multiple categories. ====Hall of Fame Award winners==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !

Hosts of the show have also been slimed, and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment, such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of Sabrina the Teenage Witch in 2001, or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013. Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed, as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007, and Halle Berry later found out in 2012. Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 awards, a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original YCDTOTV recipe, much to her dismay, proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime. Below is a list of all the celebrities that have been slimed over the past years at the Kids' Choice Awards. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !

Olympians, extreme sports stars and daredevils participated in special stunts performed live on national television\u2014often landing into the trademark green slime. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Celebrity (ies) ! width=\"85%\"| Stunt synopsis |- | align=\"center\"| 2002 | Dave Mirra | The BMX pro-biker broke his own record for a double back flip on a BMX bike and landed in a 5,000 gallon tank of green slime. |- | align=\"center\"| 2003 | Tony Hawk | The skateboarding champion skateboarded into an 11,000 gallon tank of green slime. |- | align=\"center\"| 2004 | Mat Hoffman | The BMX pro performed the \"World Record Skydiving Bike Jump\" landing in a lakefull of green slime. |- | align=\"center\"| 2005 | Donald Trump/David Spitz Jr. | From New York, The Apprentice host \"fired\" human cannonball David Spitz Jr. into the air, where he landed in a net laced with green slime. |- | align=\"center\"| 2006 |Ryan St. Onge | In a live remote from the Utah Olympic Park in Park City, Utah, the U.S. Olympic Freestyle Aerial Skier skied into 10,000 gallons of green slime. |- | align=\"center\"| 2007 | Ron Jones | Bungee jumping into a pool of slime. |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"| 2008 | Jack Black Orlando Bloom | Kids Choice 2008 had many slime stunts all hosted by professional boxer Laila Ali. Depending on the outcome of the stunt, a certain amount of green slime was added to a slime vat backstage which was referred to throughout as the \"Slime Meter\". The slime was used later on at the end of the show, in what was supposedly the \"World's Longest Celebrity Sliming,\" in which Orlando Bloom joined host Jack Black to be slimed for one solid minute. Host Black even made a remark about how the grand total of 27 tons of slime could fit in a vat that only held 25 tons. |- | Akon | In the first stunt, affectionately called the \"Slime-o-Lition Derby\", the pop star had 45 seconds to ride the Kids' Choice Bobble Head Kart. The choices were the shark-themed \"Jaws Jalopy\", a hot dog-shaped \"Weiner Wagon\" and the winner, the Jack Black Bobble Head Kart which was essentially a go-kart with a giant Jack Black head on the top. Akon successfully completed the course adding 10 tons of slime to the vat, \"plus 5 for finishing\" bringing the total to 15 tons. |- | Usher | The famous R&B; singer performed the second stunt manning a \"slime hose,\" firing at a sumo wrestler and propelling him in costume along a long platform. The amount of slime added to the vat was determined by how far the \"human target\" was propelled by the spray of slime. Viewers voting online picked the sumo wrestler over his competitor, the Scuba diver. The \"human target\" was launched all the way to the 5-ton mark bringing the total of slime in the vat to 20 tons. |- | Heidi Klum | The last stunt was performed by the supermodel or as host Black called her \"Heidi the Human Dart\". Klum was attached by a harness to a long cable, allowing her to swing freely in which she did. Armed with a pad of spikes, she swung between her platform and what was a trampoline-like wall covered in slime balloons. For every slime balloon Klum popped in 30 seconds, one more ton of slime was added to the vat. Kids voted online to determine exactly what type of spike pad Klum would use to pop the balloons. The choices were the hand-worn \"mittens\" and the winner the \"butt pad\" which unanimously beat out the mittens. Klum popped 7 balloons on the wall, adding 7 more tons of slime to the vat and bringing the total of slime in the vat to 27 tons. |- | align=\"center\"| 2009 | Will Ferrell | The comedian-actor slid down a slime-covered slide that was placed on top of Janss Steps on the UCLA campus, on a luge head first into a pool of slime. |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2010 | Apolo Anton Ohno | Two stunts were featured at the 2010 awards.
