    "text": "The New River Clyde bridge is a proposed construction as part of the ongoing regeneration of the Clyde waterfront area, in Scotland. If built, it will be the first new vehicle crossing point on the Clyde since the Clyde Arc bridge was built in 2006. ==Proposal== Renfrewshire Council are proposing a new road bridge to be built between Renfrew and Yoker.Clyde Waterfront and Renfrew Riverside, Renfrewshire CouncilMinisters give green light to \u00a390m Clyde Waterfront and Renfrew Riverside project, Scottish Condstruction Now, 20 November 2018 The site of the bridge would be at Renfrew Ferry. If built, the structure would more than likely replace the ferry service. As the Clyde is still an important area for shipping and is still used for ship building, a moveable bridge structure would have to be built to let vessels pass up and down the river. Initial estimates for construction are \u00a350m, using City Deal funding. If given the go-ahead, construction would start in 2018-19. In late 2018 the project was approved by the Scottish Government, but West Dunbartonshire Council later objected to the bridge with concerns about traffic levels. However, in February 2019, members of West Dunbartonshire Council's IRED committee unanimously voted to drop the council's objection to the project. ==References== Category:Road bridges in Scotland Category:Transport in Renfrewshire Category:Transport in Glasgow Category:Proposed bridges in the United Kingdom Category:Bridges across the River Clyde ",
