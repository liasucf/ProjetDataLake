She is known for her work on X-chromosome inactivation and for discovering the functions of a new class of epigenetic regulators known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for example Xist and Tsix. == Education == Jeannie T. Lee received an AB from Harvard College in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and an MD/PhD in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/jeannie-t-lee While at Harvard she worked with Nancy Kleckner on antisense regulation of Tn10 transposition. While at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine her advisor was Robert L. Nussbaum. Her PhD research focused on Fragile X syndrome, and let to her strong interest in X chromosome inactivation and epigenetics. Then she did postdoctoral work with Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute , during which she discovered the nature of the X-inactivation center. She was also Chief Resident of Laboratory Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital. == Research career == Lee joined the faculty at Harvard in 1997 and devoted her studies to noncoding RNA and sex chromosome dynamics during development and disease. Her major career research achievements include identifying the X inactivation center, discovering Tsix antisense RNA, determining Xist's mechanism of action, demonstrating that a lncRNA is a regulator of Polycomb repressive complex 2, and determining that the X chromosome folds like Origami and adopts a unique conformation. Her studies established the existence and function of a group of regulatory RNAs known as long noncoding RNAs or lncRNAs. There are about ten times as many lncRNAs in a eukaryotic cell as mRNAs. In a 2013 interview, she was asked what excited her about this group of RNAs. She said they control gene expression in a locus-specific way, by recruiting chromatin modifying activities to the locus, so the lncRNAs make excellent drug design targets. She founded RaNA Therapeutics to test this idea. Upon conferring the Lurie Prize to Lee in 2016, Dr. Charles A. Sanders of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health remarked: \u201cDr. Lee\u2019s work has revolutionized the field of epigenetics. Her research has led to groundbreaking contributions, and we now have a better understanding of the unique role that long non-coding RNAs play in gene expression, which could lead to the development of new therapeutics.\u201d She was President of the Genetics Society of America,http://www.nasonline.org/member- directory/members/20033180.html Codirector of the Harvard Epigenetics Initiative, and is Vice Chair of the Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. She delivered a set of lectures to iBiology on X chromosome. inactivation. == Notable publications == * Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome.
