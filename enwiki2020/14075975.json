    "text": "Fuzzy mathematics forms a branch of mathematics including fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. It started in 1965 after the publication of Lotfi Asker Zadeh's seminal work Fuzzy sets.Zadeh, L. A. (1965) \"Fuzzy sets\", Information and Control, 8, 338\u2013353. ==Definition== A fuzzy subset A of a set X is a function A:X\u2192L, where L is the interval [0,1]. This function is also called a membership function. A membership function is a generalization of a characteristic function or an indicator function of a subset defined for L = {0,1}. More generally, one can use a complete lattice L in a definition of a fuzzy subset A .Goguen, J. (1967) \"L-fuzzy sets\", J. Math. Anal. Appl., 18, 145-174. ==Fuzzification== The evolution of the fuzzification of mathematical concepts can be broken down into three stages:Kerre, E.E., Mordeson, J.N. (2005) \"A historical overview of fuzzy mathematics\", New Mathematics and Natural Computation, 1, 1-26. :# straightforward fuzzification during the sixties and seventies, :# the explosion of the possible choices in the generalization process during the eighties, :# the standardization, axiomatization, and L-fuzzification in the nineties. Usually, a fuzzification of mathematical concepts is based on a generalization of these concepts from characteristic functions to member functions. Let A and B be two fuzzy subsets of X. Intersection A \u2229 B and union A \u222a B are defined as follows: (A \u2229 B)(x) = min(A(x),B(x)), (A \u222a B)(x) = max(A(x),B(x)) for all x \u2208 X. Instead of min and max one can use t-norm and t-conorm, respectively ,Klement, E.P., Mesiar, R., Pap, E. (2000) Triangular Norms. Dordrecht, Kluwer. for example, min(a,b) can be replaced by multiplication ab. A straightforward fuzzification is usually based on min and max operations because in this case more properties of traditional mathematics can be extended to the fuzzy case. A important generalization principle used in fuzzification of algebraic operations is a closure property. Let * be a binary operation on X. The closure property for a fuzzy subset A of X is that for all x,y \u2208 X, A(x*y) \u2265 min(A(x),A(y)). Let (G,*) be a group and A a fuzzy subset of G. Then A is a fuzzy subgroup of G if for all x,y in G, A(x*y\u22121) \u2265 min(A(x),A(y\u22121)). A similar generalization principle is used, for example, for fuzzification of the transitivity property. Let R be a fuzzy relation in X, i.e. R is a fuzzy subset of X\u00d7X. Then R is transitive if for all x,y,z in X, R(x,z) \u2265 min(R(x,y),R(y,z)). == Fuzzy analogues == Fuzzy subgroupoids and fuzzy subgroups were introduced in 1971 by A. Rosenfeld .Rosenfeld, A.
