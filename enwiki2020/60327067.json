    "text": "Bez Tebe (; ; stylized in sentence case) is the debut studio album by Slovenian singer-songwriter Senidah. It was released on 25 March 2019 under Belgrade-based label Bassivity Digital. Songs were written by the artist and Benjamin Krneti\u0107 and produced by An\u017ee Kacafura, with the exception of \"Crno Srce\", which is written and produced by Slobodan Veljkovi\u0107. The record, containg ten tracks, is primarily urban music incorporating electronic, soul and indie music. Lyrically, songs are about searching for love. ==Background== In March 2018 Senidah released her trap solo single \"Sla\u0111ana\" for Belgrade- based label Bassivity Digital, quickly acquiring enormous popularity on the West Balkans. The second single \"Belo\" (White) was then released on 3 June. The title track and \"Nisi Bio Tu\" (You Weren't Here) were released on 28 December, alongside lyrics videos. \"Sla\u0111ana\" won The Best Hip-Hop Song of the Year Award at the 2019 Music Awards Ceremony. She started teasing the album on the ceremony red carpet, alongside her collaboration with RAF Camora. On 19 March 2019 Senidah announced the release of her debut studio album via Instagram. On the day of release, she held a promotion for media, friends and colleagues and presented the music video for \"Crno Srce\" (Black Heart). The rest of the songs were uploaded to YouTube on 15 May. ==Music and lyrics== A trap and soul record, Bez Tebe also features elements of synth-pop and indie music. The songs were composed by Senidah alongside album's producer An\u017ee Kacafura, while the lyrics were written by Benjamin Krneti\u0107. The album's opening track, \"Soba\" (Room), has a slow trap beat completed with emotional lyrics, settling the tone for the whole record. The meaning behind the title of the lead single, \"Sla\u0111ana\", which is a common female first name, was said to be a representation of a random girl seeking for love, whom people can relate to. Whilst, some believe that the title is referring to the street slang term for amphetamine and its influence as an escape from reality, disappointment and loneliness. Others think it's referring to Serbian rock musician Sla\u0111ana Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who's noted for her unique appearance and musical style. The third track, \"Crno Srce\" (Black Heart), deepens the dark atmosphere. However, \"Aman\" (Enough Already) brings brighter vibe, despite singing about a relationship coming to its end. The song also incorporates several Turkish terms common to the West Balkans. The title track, \"Bez Tebe\", is a melancholic trap ballad. Sixth track, \"Tre\u0107i Svet\" (Third World), was described as a 'summer jam'. \"Vatra\" (Fire), also features summer motives, but with a darker tone. \"Belo\" (White), again holds a drug reference this time with explicit allusions laced throughout the track. \"Strava\" (Horror) was described as a rave love song influenced by the '80s music. The final track, \"Nisi Bio Tu\" (You Weren't Here) was based on an unfortunate event from Senidah's life and brings honest ending to the album, featuring acoustic guitar and powerful vocals. In an interview for the Serbian edition of Hello! she dubbed it \"her saddest song that she doesn't want to talk about\". ==Critical reception== Bez Tebe was met with generally positive reviews from critics. On behalf of Slovenian magazine Mladina, Gregor Kocijan\u010di\u010d praised the album and remarked that Senidah brought back the epicentre of Balkan music to Ljubljana for the first time following the punk scene of the 1980s. Nevertheless, he was critical of the record's occasional embrace of turbo-folk elements, while abandoning the frames of R&B.; Writing for Muzika.hr, Patrik Horvat called the album the artist's \"powerful and interesting introduction to the general public\", noting that she \"faithfully transformed her heavy emotions into impressive pieces of art that were authentically brought out by her voice\". Vanja Ratkovi\u0107 of Noizz.rs drew comparisons between the voice of the artist and the voice of British musician FKA twigs \"due to their mysteriousness\", claiming that \"the Balkans have finally come up with an artist who can compete at an international level\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Discogs.
