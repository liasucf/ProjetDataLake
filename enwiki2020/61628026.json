    "text": "Le Tote is an online women's clothing rental business in the United States which uses a subscription box model. It was founded in 2012 by Brett Northart (now President) and Rakesh Tondon (now CEO). In 2019, Le Tote acquired Lord & Taylor. Le Tote is one of several companies renting women's clothes; competitors include Rent the Runway, The Ms. Collection, Gwynnie Bee, and Armarium. While Rent the Runway focuses more on high-end, \"event-driven\" clothes, Le Tote mainly rents \"everyday wear.\" In late August 2019, Le Tote finalized an agreement with Hudson's Bay Company to buy the Lord & Taylor chain for C$99.5 million in cash on closing (probably before year end 2019) plus C$33.2 million two years later. HBC was to get a 25% equity stake in Le Tote. The buyer would retain the stores' inventory, with an estimated value of C$284.2 million. The deal required HBC to pay the stores' rent for at least three years, at an estimated C$77 million cash per year. Le Tote opened its first physical location, inside a Lord & Taylor store in the Ridge Hill Mall in Yonkers, NY, in October 2019. It is referred to as a Rental Studio and customers can view a selection of inventory and sign up for the service there. On August 2, 2020, Le Tote and subsidiary of Le Tote, Lord & Taylor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:American companies established in 2012 Category:Retail companies established in 2012 Category:Non-store retailing Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Subscription services Category:Clothing rental companies Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 ",
