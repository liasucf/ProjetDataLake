    "text": "Satan's Blade is a 1985 American slasher film directed by L. Scott Castillo, Jr. It follows two groups of people lodging at a mountain resort who are stalked by a mysterious killer potentially linked to a supernatural entity in the mountains. Shot in 1980 in Big Bear, California, Satan's Blade was released on VHS in 1985, and later received Blu-ray releases by Olive Films in the United States in 2015, and by Arrow Films in the United Kingdom in 2016. ==Plot== A pair of female bank robbers make off with $50,000 after they kill two bank tellers in cold blood. They lay low at a snowy mountain cabin resort while waiting to rendezvous with their partner, George. As they wait, one of the robbers gets greedy and shoots the other. She plans to do the same to George when he arrives, but she doesn't get the chance, as she's stabbed in the back by an unseen assailant while dragging her ex-partner's body. Ben, the local sheriff, and another officer arrive at the cabin after gunfire is reported, and discover the bodies. The next day, two married couples arrive at the resort to celebrate one of the men's (Tony) graduation from law school and passing of the bar examination. Simultaneously, a group of college girls also arrive with a friend whose father has recently died. Despite being told of the murders and a local legend about a murderous mountain man who comes from the bottom of a nearby lake, the college girls decide to take the cabin, which is right next door to where the married couples are staying. During the night, one of the young women has a nightmare of a man murdering her and everyone else. The following day, one of the college women, Stephanie, meets Tony on the lake, and the two talk. Stephanie ends up spending the afternoon with Tony, while her friends stay back at their cabin. That night, an unseen killer enters the girls' cabin and systematically stabs each of them to death. Stephanie returns to the cabin later in the evening and discovers all of her friends have been murdered. She retreats to Tony and his friends' cabin, which the killer eventually breaches, murdering everyone inside except for Stephanie, who hides under a bed. The following morning, she emerges from the cabin and meets Sheriff Ben, who embraces her before stabbing her in the stomach. When she asks him why, he admits that he simply wanted the money stowed in the cabin, and that he didn't want to hurt anyone; however, he alternately explains that he is possessed and brandishes a knife that is a talisman. Stephanie flees back into the cabin, but Ben follows, chasing her up the staircase, where he tackles her to the floor and stabs her to death. Afterwards, Ben throws the knife in the lake. Later, a hand emerges from the lake and throws the knife back out, the blade sticking in the side of a tree. A man hiking through the woods notices the knife and dislodges it from the tree bark. ==Cast== *Tom Bongiorno as Tony *Stephanie Leigh Steel as Stephanie *Thomas Cue as Al *Elisa R.

This release of the film runs 82 minutes in length. In the United Kingdom, the film was submitted for approval by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in 2016.

This is where the film is the most charming, however, because the film's many failures work in the viewer's favors.\" On a scale of 1 to 10, HorrorNews.net awarded the film a rating of 6/10. The reviewer noted the film's poor acting, audio, lighting, and film quality; but further stated, \"unless you are a fan of old school low budget slasher films, this may not be the film for you. otherwise, it is a good example of the genre and the time period.\" Hysteria Lives! rated the film a negative 1.5 out of 5 stars, stating that although the film had its moments, it was essentially a zero budget copy of the first two Friday the 13th films. ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * * * Category:1985 films Category:1985 horror films Category:1980s slasher films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American slasher films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in country houses Category:Films set in forests Category:Films shot in Big Bear Lake, California ",
