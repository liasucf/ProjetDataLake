He continued at Tohoku as a faculty member, and became a full professor there in 1988.Biography, Tohoku University, retrieved 2015-03-19. He was the Dean of Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University from April 2008 to March 2010. He retired in 2010, becoming a professor emeritus at Tohoku University, but continued teaching as a professor at Kwansei Gakuin University until March 2015.Faculty profile, Kwansei Gakuin University, retrieved 2015-03-19. He was an Auditor of Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology from April 2016 to October 2018. ==Contributions== Nishizeki has made significant contributions to algorithms for series-parallel graphs, finding cliques in sparse graphs, planarity testing and the secret sharing with any access structure. He is the co-author of two books on planar graphs and graph drawing.; . In 1990, Nishizeki founded the annual International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC). ==Awards and honors== At the 18th ISAAC symposium, in 2007, a workshop was held in honor of his 60th birthday.ISAAC Day 1, Joachim Gudmundsson, dense outliers, December 21, 2007, retrieved 2015-03-19. In 1996 he became a life fellow of the IEEE \"for contributions to graph algorithms with applications to physical design of electronic systems.\"1995 New Fellows, IEEE Japan Section, retrieved 2015-03-19. In 1996 he was selected as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery \"for contributions to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for planar graphs, network flows and VLSI routing\".ACM Fellow award citation, retrieved 2015-03-19.
