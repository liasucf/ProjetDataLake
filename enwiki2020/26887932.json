A Judicial Commission, headed by an honest judge, Justice Rajeshekharan Nair, is investigating into the scam. Vettukuzhi, a corrupt political kingmaker, tries to save Sadasivan and the reputation of his party. Dr. Dinesh, son of Sadasivan, does not appreciate his father's illicit friendship with Vettukuzhi. Dr. Dinesh's and his lover Sunitha's marriage gets called off due to the allegations faced by his father. With things getting tense, Vettukuzhi tries to bribe Rajasekharan, but fails. In his attempt to complete his new novel, Shabari, a young and noted writer, has a temporary residence at the local government guest house. With the arrival of the Commission, Shabari is forced to vacate his room for Justice Nair and family, which consists of wife Malathi and daughter Devi, who is also an amateur dancer. Shabari and Devi fall in love via mutual admiration for their artistic skills, without personally getting to know each other. Rajasekharan and Malathi are happy about this union. When Shabari proposes to Devi, she remains silent, and only then he realizes that she lacks the ability to speak. Though devastated, he informs his parents about the situation, and his family staunchly opposes his proposal. Justice Rajasekharan tries to convince Shabari's father, who is also his childhood friend, though he fails to influence the family's decision. Eventually, the Commission submits its report about the dam scam, which results in the resignation of Minister Sadasivan. Devi's family remains heartbroken over her fate, while preparing to leave the Guest House. The very next morning, Shabari's family arrives and convinces Rajasekharan of their consent to accept Devi, who has now gone missing. In a frantic search, Shabari finally finds a weary Devi sitting by the river side. Thus, the duo is united, ending the film on a happy note. ==Cast== *Prem Nazir as Justice Rajasekharan Nair *Jayaram as Shabari *Shobhana as Devi, Rajasekharan's Daughter *Jayabharathi as Malathi, Rajasekharan's Wife *Suresh Gopi as Dr. Dinesh, Minister Ongallur Sadasivan's Son *Karamana Janardanan Nair as Kuttisankaran, Shabari's Father *Thilakan as Vettukuzhy, A Politician and Minister Ongalloor Sadasivan's Friend *Sukumari as Thankamani, Shabari's Mother *Nedumudi Venu as Shekharan, Shabari's Family Friend *Innocent as Rappayi, Aide at the Guest House *Jagathi Sreekumar as Manikanta Pillai, Manager at the Guest House *Oduvil Unnikrishnan as Kurup, Marriage Broker *Mamukkoya as Mamu *K.
