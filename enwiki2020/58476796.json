    "text": "Fran\u00e7oise d'Humi\u00e8res, Dame de Contay, n\u00e9e de Contay (circa 1489-1557), was a French court official; she served as Governess of the Children of France from 1546 to 1557. Fran\u00e7oise d'Humi\u00e8res was the daughter of Charles de Contay, senechal du Maine, and Barbe de Hallwin, and married the courtier Jean d'Humi\u00e8res (d. 1550) in 1507. She inherited the lordship of Contay from her father, and became Dame de Contay. In 1546, she and her spouse where appointed governor and governess to the Dauphin, and subsequently became the main governor and governess to all the children of king Henry II of France and Catherine de Medici. The royal children were raised under their direct supervision, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers. As head governor and governess, the d'Humi\u00e8res couple headed the staff of the royal nursery, staff of about 250 people, which included tutors and governesses of lower rank, who attended more directly to each of the children. Among them was notably Marie- Catherine Gondi, who served as sub-governess. The royal children where mainly raised away from the rest of the court on Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and when the royal court visited Saint Germain, the nursery was sent to Ch\u00e2teau de Blois or Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise. From 1548, the nursery was expanded to include Mary, Queen of Scots and her governess (Janet Stewart, Lady Fleming, later Fran\u00e7oise de Paroy) and personal Scottish entourage of about 30 people. When her spouse died in 1550, he was succeeded as governor by Claude d'Urf\u00e9, who was given charge of the finances of the royal nursery, but the king confirmed Fran\u00e7oise d'Humi\u00e8res as main governess with the responsibility for his children. Several letters are known between the king and queen and the d'Humi\u00e8res regarding the upbringing of the royal children. ==References== ==Sources== * *Robert J. Knecht, Hero or Tyrant?
