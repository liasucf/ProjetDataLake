See Vitto, Fanny (2015), p. 10, note 2. south of Beit She'an and about west of the Jordan River, containing the longest written text hitherto discovered in any mosaic in the Land of Israel, and also the oldest known Talmudic text.Sussmann, Jacob (1975), pp. 123, 124. Quote: [p. 123] \"The inscription contains twenty-nine long lines, among which are 1807 letters! It is, by far, larger than all the inscriptions discovered until now among mosaic flooring, whether those belonging to ancient synagogues or those belonging to other structures. Thus, for example, it is more than three-times larger than the inscription found at Ein Gedi, which was discovered a few years ago, and which was, until now, the largest one discovered in the country.\" [...] [p. 124] \"This is the first time that we have access to any Talmudic text inscribed close to the time of its inception and in close proximity to the centers of Talmudic formulation in the Land of Israel, a text that was inscribed, presumably, not too far after the redaction of the original Palestinian work, and in a place that is nigh the spiritual center of the Land of Israel during the Talmudic era: viz., Tiberias of the 5th-century (B)CE (sic). The text before us is not dependent upon the textual tradition of handwritten manuscripts, the pathway in which the Palestinian Talmudic literature has reached us; nor was it transferred unto us by way of reed pens (calamus) used by the scribes, copyists and proofreaders of various kinds, and for this reason it is invaluable for offering a critique on the Talmudic text. What is especially important is the clear Palestinian spelling of words, and their original versions of many geographical place-names, two areas that were rife with copyist-errors, and those made by proofreaders.\" END QUOTE Unlike other mosaics found in the region, the Re\u1e25ob mosaic has very little in the form of ornate design and symmetric patterns, but is unique due to its inscription, acclaimed by scholars to be one of the most important epigraphical findings discovered in Israel in the last century.Sussmann, Jacob (1975), p. 123 Its text sheds invaluable light on the historical geography (toponymy) of Palestine during the Late Roman and Byzantine periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in different regions.Vitto, Fanny (2015), p. 7; Sussmann, Jacob (1975), p. 124; et al. These eight regions are: the area of Scythopolis (modern-day Beit She'an) and the Jordan valley (the longest paragraph), Susita (Hippos) and its neighbouring settlements on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, Naveh (Naw\u0101) in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, Tyre and its neighbouring cities to the south, and the Land of Israel proper, dealt with in the second-longest paragraph, followed by the cities of Paneas and Caesarea, finishing with villages from the vicinity of Sebaste.Ben David, Chaim (2011), pp. 231-240 By delineating the boundaries of the Land of Israel, it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian captivity,Ben David, Chaim (2011), p. 238; Lieberman, S. (1976), p. 55; et al.The Baraitta of the borders of Eretz-Israel is, for all practical purposes, only a geographical reference to the old borders, as once settled, but not an ethnographic reference to the border for all time, since demographics change. and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in what concerns the laws of Seventh Year produce, and of demai produce. The mosaic also describes different kinds of fruits and vegetables that were cultivated in the country at the time, and the laws which applied to them at the time.Sussmann, Jacob (1975), p. 124; Feliks, Yehuda (1986), p. 454; Jewish legal inscription from a synagogue, Israel Museum, Jerusalem ==History== A Late Roman and Byzantine-period Jewish village located about one kilometre (half mile) northwest of Tel Rehov has preserved the old name in the form of Rehov (Hebrew) or Roob/Ro\u014db (Latin).Mazar, A. (1999)Onomasticon (1971), \"Ro\u014db\" (entry No. 766)Marcellius, R.P. Henricus (n.d.), p. 469 (s.v. Roob) According to excavator F. Vitto, the village synagogue underwent three phases of construction and reconstruction: first built as a basilical hall in the 4th century CE, it was destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in the following century, with the addition of a bemah, of a new mosaic floor and a plaster coating for the walls and pillars, decorated with several inscriptions; and the last phase, dating to the 6th or 7th century CE, when the narthex was added on whose floor the halakhic inscription was laid. Others put the creation of the halakhic inscription in the late 3rd century CE at the earliest.Feliks, Yehuda (1986), pp. 454\u2013455 The synagogue was probably abandoned after being destroyed in an earthquake.Alexandre, Yardenna (2017) The site of the ancient Jewish village was later taken by the Arab village of Farwana, documented at least since the Ottoman period, and abandoned during the 1948 war. Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv was established in 1946 on land including the ancient site.Vitto, Fanny (1975), p. 119; Vitto, Fanny (2015), p. 3 The remains of the ancient synagogue were first discovered by members of Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv while preparing their lands for cultivation in the late 1960s. An archaeological excavation of the site in 1973, led by a team under IAA's Fanny Vitto, revealed the mosaic and its content, which has been on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem since 1978.Archaeology Wing - Ward 6 (The Holy Land). ==Description of mosaic== The mosaic pieces are made of black limestone tesserae contrasted against a white background, measuring , with an accompanying text written on 29 lines, comprising a total of 350 words,Vitto, Fanny (1974), pp. 102\u2013104 with an average length of to each line. It begins with the salutation, \"Shalom\" \u2013 Peace!, followed by a long halakhic text, and ends with the salutation, \"Shalom,\" followed by an appendix where it lists some eighteen towns in the vicinity of Sebaste (the ancient city of Samaria) whose fruits and vegetables were exempt from tithes and the stringencies applied to Seventh Year produce. There is little uniformity in the size of the letters, while the spelling of some words is faulty. Portions of the main text contain elements that are related to late second-century rabbinic literature, particularly that found in the Tosefta (Shevi'it 4:8\u201311), the Jerusalem Talmud (Demai 2:1; Shevi'it 6:1) and Sifrei on Deuteronomy 11:24, although the mosaic of Re\u1e25ob expands on aspects of each. The more ancient text in the Re\u1e25ob mosaic has been used to correct errors in transmission of extant rabbinic texts.Sussmann, Jacob (1975), p. 124 Of especial interest to philologists, the system of spelling in the mosaic follows the Beth-Shean practice of enunciation, where \u02bbayin () is often interchanged with aleph (), and \u1e25et () is often interchanged with he (), just as it is alluded to in the Jerusalem Talmud (Berakhot 2:4)Arie Itzhaki (1980), p. 36 ==Legal (halakhic) background== Replica of mosaic at Kibbutz Ein Hanatziv The text in the Re\u1e25ob mosaic can only be understood in the context of Jewish law at the time, which required the tithing of agricultural produce six years out of a seven-year cycle, as well as the observance of Seventh Year law strictures on the same produce once in every seven years. This, too, was contingent upon lands that had been settled by returning Jews from the Babylonian captivity. The underlying principle in Jewish law states that when the Jewish exiles returned from the Babylonian captivity in the 4th century BCE, the extent of territories resettled by them in Galilee and in Judea did not equal nor exceed the territory originally conquered by Israel at the time of Joshua, more commonly referred to as \"those who came-up from Egypt.\"Babylonian Talmud (Hullin 7a; Yebamot 16a); Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, Hil. Terumot 1:5\u20136 The practical bearing of this restructuring of boundaries (although still part of the biblical Land of Israel proper)As argued by Ishtori Haparchi (2007), pp. 40, 42. Although Rashi in BT Hullin 6b (s.v. \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05df \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4) says that Beit She'an was not part of the Land of Israel, Ishtori Haparchi argues that the sense here is to places not captured by the Returnees from Babylon, although they were conquered by Joshua, and which places have only the technical name of \"outside the Land of Israel,\" just as we see with Akko in BT Gittin 76b. Likewise, Beit She'an was subdued by Israel during the time of Joshua, forcing its inhabitants to pay tribute unto Israel (BT Hullin 7a on Judges 1:27\u201328), but was not taken by the Returnees from Babylon. meant that places then settled by non-Jewish residents in the land (whether Phoenicians, Syrians, Grecians, or otherwise) and not taken by Israel were not deemed as consecrated landAs explained by Menachem Meiri in his Beit HaBechirah (Hullin 6b, s.v. \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05df), although Ishtori Haparchi (Kaftor Vaferach) disputes this, saying that the land was always consecrated, but that the laws regarding the land differed with Israel's return from the Babylonian exile. and, therefore, fruits and vegetables grown in such places and purchased by Jews were exempt from the laws of tithing, and of Seventh Year restrictions. However, if fruits and vegetables were purchased by gentile vendors from Israelites in their respective places and transported into these non-consecrated places in order to be sold in the marketplaces, they were still made subject to tithing as demai-produce by prospective Jewish buyers.Safrai, Z. (1977), p. 17 (note 91). The term \"demai\" is a Halakhic term meaning \"dubious,\" referring to agricultural produce, the owner of which was not trusted with regard to the correct separation of the tithes assigned to the Levites, although the terumah (the part designated unto priests) was believed to have been separated from such fruits. In such \"dubious\" cases, all that was necessary was to separate the one-tenth portion due to the priests from the First Tithe given to the Levites, being the 1/100th part of the whole. The Second Tithe is also removed (redeemed) from the fruit in such cases of doubt. The fruits and vegetables mentioned in the Re\u1e25ob mosaic with respect to Beit She'an (as detailed in the Jerusalem Talmud) were not locally grown in Beit She'an, but were transported there from places settled by Israel.Jerusalem Talmud, Demai 2:1 (Commentary of Solomon Sirilio); p. 16a in the Oz veHadar edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. Beit She'an was a frontier city along the country's eastern front with Transjordan, and since it was not initially settled by Israelites upon their return from Babylon, although later Israelites had joined the local inhabitants,Josephus mentions a population of above 13,000 Jews in Beit She'an at the outset of the war with Rome in the second half of the 1st century CE. See Josephus (1981), s.v. The Jewish War 2.18.3. (p. 493). all home-grown fruits and vegetables there were made exempt from tithing in the days of Rabbi Judah HaNasi.Babylonian Talmud (Hullin 6b\u20137a); Jerusalem Talmud (Demai 2:1, s.v. \u05e8' \u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e8' \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e9\u05dd \u05e8' \u05d9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05df \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05df). According to the Talmud, Rabbi Judah HaNasi, taking as an exemplum an act that he heard performed by Rabbi Meir, released the entire region of Beit Shean from the obligations of tithing home-grown produce, and from observing the Seventh Year laws with respect to the same produce. He also did the same for the cities of Kefar \u1e62ema\u1e25, Caesarea and Beit Gubrin. Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posqui\u00e8res holds that the enactment made by Rabbi Judah HaNasi applied only to vegetables, but not unto produce belonging to harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), the fruit of the vine (grapes, raisins, wine), or to produce derived from the olive tree (olives and olive oil), since the commandment to tithe these products is a biblical injunction. Tel Rehov ancient synagogue: marble screen with menorah relief ==Translation of ancient text== [Excursus: The agricultural products named above were not cultivated in Beit She'an, but were brought into the city by donkey drivers, whether they were Jewish rustics or in some cases non-Jews, who had bought them from Jewish planters in other regions of the countryThat is to say, the country settled by Israelites upon their return from the Babylonian captivity. to be sold in the marketplace of Beit She'an.Sussmann, J. (1975), p. 126 To this list can be added the special fruits peculiar to the Hebrew nation and mentioned in Mishnah Demai 2:1, if perchance they were acquired by a Jew from his fellow co-religionist who was unskillful in the laws of his countymen, such as a cultivar of dates grown only in Israel,Formerly, dates (Phoenix dactylifera) grown in the Land of Israel were renowned for their high-quality, both, in sweetness and in moisture content. A nearly 2,000 year-old date pit retrieved from Masada was recently germinated in Israel, and DNA studies revealed that the cultivar, although not the same, was very similar to the Egyptian Hayani (Hayany) cultivar, a date that is dark-red to nearly black in color, and soft. (See: ). cakes of dried figs that were prepared strictly in Israel, and carob- fruit of a quality found only in Israel. In this case, they too would require the removal of the tithe known as demai. All other fruits and vegetables cultivated in Beit She'an would have been exempt from tithing altogether, seeing that when Rabbi Judah HaNasi permitted the eating of vegetables in the Seventh Year in Beit She'an,That is to say, when he released Israel from observing the restrictions associated with that year (such as the rabbinic prohibition of eating \"aftergrowths,\" or the requirement to discard from one's home any Seventh Year fruit once the growing season for such fruit had ended and the like of such fruit could no longer be found in the fields (see: Ishtori Haparchi (2004), p. 62; Obadiah of Bertinoro). However, Ishtori Haparchi (2004), p. 68, has explained that Rabbi Judah HaNasi would still require the tithing of any of the five cereal grains, grapes, and olives in Beit She'an, since their ordinance is a rabbinic ordinance that is still applicable and has not been cancelled. it was one and the same enactment, namely, the release from the Seventh Year obligations and the release from tithing all produce throughout the remaining six years of the seven-year cycle.Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:4); p. 51a in the Oz veHadar edition, or 18a in most other editions.] [Excursus: The import of detailing the above frontier towns and villages was to show the boundaries of the Land of Israel as retained by the Jews who returned from the Babylonian captivity. Where agricultural produce was prohibited unto Jews living in these areas, this implies that these places were originally part of those places settled by the Returnees from Babylon, and that since the land was consecrated by their arrival in those parts, all fruits and vegetables were prohibited until the time that they could be tithed, and the land was required to lie fallow during the Seventh Year. However, where the places were designated as \"dubious,\" this is explained in the Tosefta (Shevi'it 4:8) as meaning that initially these places were permitted (as there was no requirement to tithe produce grown in these places), but later the Sages of Israel made all fruits and vegetables in these places prohibited until they were first tithed. This may have been the result of produce being brought into these towns and villages from regions liable to tithing and sold there, or else it was not clear unto the Sages if these places had actually been settled by the people of Israel who returned from Babylon. In any case, the practice is to behave stringently with regard to such produce.] Places east of the Sea of Galilee (in the Golan Heights region and beyond) ===Regulation of produce between Achziv (Chezib) and Tyre=== The maritime city of Akko (Ptolemais), and the river south of Achziv (Chezib),On the far western coastline, the precise place marking the extent of the boundary of Eretz Israel in the vicinity of Chezib was understood to be the River below Chezib (i.e. Nahr Mefshukh, or what is now called Na\u1e25al Ga'athon), in accordance with a teaching in Tosefta (Shevi'it 4:6): \"Which is the Land of Israel? From the river south of Achzib, etc.\" Some have erroneously identified this river as the Kasmieh River (also called Litani River) in southern Lebanon. The river (Nahr Mefshukh) is shown in the Palestine Exploration Fund map produced in 1878. As one moved further east of this place, the border extended northward. a small coastal town ca. north of Acre, according to the Mishnah (Demai 1:3 and Gittin 1:2), were the extent of the northern boundary settled by Jews returning from the Babylonian captivity in the days of Ezra.A view largely held by many, including by Ishtori Haparchi (2004), p. 69 (note 120). Although the butts and bounds of Akko were mentioned to imply that bills of divorce written there must be done in the presence of competent witnesses, see the Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 76b), where it states that whenever the Rabbis would escort their companions northbound, they would only go with them as far as Akko, so as not to leave the border of the country taken by the Returnees from Babylonia. Nevertheless, part of the country taken by the Returnees from Babylon also bypassed Akko to the right-hand side, and extended as far as Achziv (Chezib) to the north, just as it is explained in the Tosefta (Ohelot 18:14): \"He that walks [northbound] from Akko to Chezib, from his right-side towards the east the route is pure in terms of [defilement from] land of the gentiles, and he is obligated in what concerns the tithe and Seventh Year produce, until it becomes known [to him once again] that it is exempt; but from his left-side towards the west the route is defiled in terms of land of the gentiles, and [such produce] is exempt from tithes and from the laws governing the Seventh Year, until it becomes known [to him once more] that it is obligated, until he reaches Chezib.\" The same Baraitta is quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud, (Shevi'it 16a). On the Palestine Exploration Fund Map of 1878, the coastal city of Achziv is written there by its Arabic name, ez-Z\u012bb. Produce locally grown in the country beyond Achziv was exempt from the rules of demai-produce,The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1933, s.v. Tractate Demai 1:3 but if purchased from Achziv itself, it required tithing.Based on Tosefta Demai 1:10 (end), which states: \"[Produce purchased from] a caravan which goes down to Kheziv is liable [to be tithed] since it is presumed to have come from Galilee.\" Although the towns and villages (in what follows here) were traditionally outside of the territorial bounds occupied by Jews returning from Babylonia, still, these cities attracted Jewish settlement.As evidenced by Rabbi Ami in the Jerusalem Talmud (Rome MS.) on Demai 2:1, when referencing these same cities between Akko and Tyre. In addition, fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel were often transported northward, along the route known as the Promontory of Tyre (Heb. \u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8). Israelites who frequented these areas, or who had moved there, were likely to buy fruits that had not been properly tithed in Israel, or had been marketed during the Sabbatical Year.Frankel, Rafael; et al. (2001), p. 153 (Appendix III) The emphasis on the regulation of agricultural produce obtained by Israel in the following northern areas, or, as the Rehob inscription says, \"what an Israelite has purchased\" in those parts, was because of its doubtful nature. ===Boundary of the Land of Israel in the 4th c. BCE=== The following frontier cities once marked the boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the geographical limits of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical- year restrictions within that same border, or, in the event of being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate therefrom only the demai- tithe. As one moved further east of Achziv, the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south Lebanon, and as far east as places in the present-day Kingdom of Jordan. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law (Halacha), they did not always reflect a political reality, insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.Frankel & Finkelstein (1983), pp. 39\u201346. [Excursus: Jose ben Joezer of \u1e92areda and Jose ben Yo\u1e25anan of Jerusalem decreed defilement in respect of the country of the gentiles (BT, Shabbat 14b), so that the priests of Aaron's lineage will not venture beyond the borders of Israel and, in so doing, become defiled unawares by corpse-uncleanness and turn again to defile their offerings (which must needs be eaten by them in a state of ritual purity). Ashkelon was long deemed as one of such cities, as it was settled by gentiles and not conquered by Israel upon their return from the Babylonian exile.Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1); p. 44b in the Oz ve'Hadar edition. The Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) relates how that Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, a priest of Aaron's lineage, and others with him, used to go down into the marketplace of the Saracens in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse themselves in order to eat their bread (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi Ishmael, the son of Rabbi Jose, and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon \u2013 though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile \u2013 was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city.Excepting only in specific places, such as in the dwelling place of a gentile, where a gentile has dwelt for at least forty days, in accordance with the Mishnah (Ohelot 18:7), in which case it was suspected that a foetus was buried in that house and conveys uncleanness (JT, Shevi'it 6:1, Solomon Sirilio). Therefore, taking as an exemplum the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of cleanness over the city's air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without harboring feelings of guilt or fear of contracting uncleanness. The next day, they assembled themselves again, this time to declare, by a majority vote, that the city's agricultural produce was exempt from tithes \u2013 even with such doubtful produce as had been carried into the city from places in Israel proper, unlike the restrictions regarding produce brought into the region of Tyre.Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1); p. 45a in the Oz ve'Hadar edition. This was done with the intent of easing the burden of the poor of Israel during the Seventh Year.Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, Hil. Terumot 1:5\u20136] ===Caesarea Maritima=== The maritime city of Caesarea Maritima was an enclave along the Mediterranean coast not immediately settled by Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s returning from the Babylonian exile. Later, however, Jews joined the inhabitants of the city, yet, by the 1st century CE, it was still principally settled by foreigners, mostly Grecians.Josephus (1981), The Jewish War (2.14.4; 3.19.1) To ease the strictures placed upon the poor of the Jewish nation during the Seventh Year (since planting was prohibited throughout that year, and after-growths could not be taken by the people), Rabbi Judah HaNasi (2nd century CE) found the juridical legitimacy to release the city (and its bounds) from the obligation of tithing locally-grown produce, and from the restrictions associated with Seventh Year produce.Jerusalem Talmud (Demai 2:1); p. 16b in the Oz ve'Hadar edition. Cf. Tosefta (Ohelot 18:16), which brings down a dispute concerning Caesarea. Notwithstanding, on certain fruits and on one commodity spice (see infra.), they still required the separation of the demai tithe because of the majority of these specific items being transported into Caesarea from other places of the country held by Israel. However, during the Seventh Year, since these items were usually not harvested or worked by Jews in that year, the majority of such produce were esteemed as such that had been harvested and worked by the gentiles of that place and who are not obligated in the laws of the Seventh Year. This, therefore, made it permissible unto Jews to purchase from them such items. ===Addendum: Permitted towns in region of Sebaste=== Between the country of Judea and the country of Galilee lies an intermediate stretch of land known as \"the strip of the Samaritans.\"The enclave inhabited by Samaritans. Cf. Jerusalem Talmud (\u1e24agigah 3:4) and Babylonian Talmud (\u1e24agigah 25a). These are said to have converted to Judaism in later years, but again ostracized by mainstream Judaism. Still, in what concerns tithes, they were obligated to abide by such laws, although in reality they often neglected its practice. Compare the Tosefta (Kelim - Baba Metzia 6:10), where it speaks of a Gaba in Samaria, belonging to the Samaritans, saying: \"They did not mention the pomegranates of B\u0101den nor the leeks of Jaba\u02bb of the House of the Samaritans (Heb. K\u016bth\u012bm) except to say that they are tithed as produce [that went] certainly untithed.\" Jews often passed through the region, while en route from Galilee to Jerusalem during the three annual pilgrimages, and again when returning home. Mosaic of Rehob, at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (before its reconstruction) Although the region of Samaria was not seized at the very outset by those Jews returning from the Babylonian exile,See Hamitovsky, I. (2004), p. 37. who cites Megillat Taanit, where it alleges that the Samaritans would not allow them to do so in the beginning, until at length (on the 25th of the lunar month Mera\u1e25\u0161\u01ddwan) the Returnees from Babylonia went to Shomron (later called Sebaste) and there settled, building a wall around that place, and later being joined by other Jewish villagers who established yet other towns and who were given the term \"grafted cities\" (Heb. \u05e2\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea\u05d0). the priests of Aaron's descent were still permitted to pass through that section of the country, without fear of contracting defilement in respect to the country of the gentiles. Nonetheless, with respect to fruits and vegetables had in Samaria, there were some places in Samaria that were exempt from tithes, as if they had been a foreign land. The Jerusalem Talmud, when speaking about the impropriety of leaving the Land of Israel, describes the standard rule of practice of the time: \"Said Rabbi Abbahu: 'There are hamlets belonging to the Samaritans wherein it has been customary to permit [a Jew's passage through them], since the days of Joshua, the son of Nun, and they are permitted' (i.e. released from the laws requiring tithing of produce).\"Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1); p. 46a in the Oz ve'Hadar edition. The reason for this exemption is explained by Talmudic exegete, Solomon Sirilio, as being that these villages in Samaria and their suburbs had the status of feudal or usufruct lands given by grant from the State to farm- laborers for a share of its increase, while the majority of increase accrued unto the State.Solomon Sirilio, on Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) (p. 46a in the Oz ve'Hadar edition); Hamitovsky, I. (2004), p. 43; Dar, Shimon (1986), pp. 257, 259, 261; Applebaum, Shimon (1989), pp. 106\u2013110. This was enough to exempt such produce from the requirement of tithing, since the kingdom (Ptolemaic or Roman, or otherwise) had not forfeited its hold over such lands, and since the Jewish regulations for tithing prescribe that produce or grain that is to be tithed must be the property of its tither, in accordance with Deuteronomy 14:22, \"\u2026you shall tithe all the produce of your seed\" - meaning, your seed, but not the seed belonging to others.Solomon Sirilio, Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1), s.v. \u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05df \u05d3\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05dc\u05d8\u05ea\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d0. The following list of towns concerns those hamlets held by the State (kingdom) in the region of Sebaste (the biblical city of Samaria) and which were, therefore, exempt from the laws of tithing.Other villages (here unnamed) are assumed to not have been under the same leniency, as being privately owned and inhabited by either Samaritans or Jews. The list is not known from any other source, and is only alluded to in the Jerusalem Talmud.Sussmann, Jacob (1975), p. 127 By this it is implied that other towns and villages that were settled by the Samaritans, such as Geba\u02bbNeubauer, A. (1868), chapter vi, p. 264, s.v. \u05d2\u05d1\u05e2 - Gu\u00e9ba; Avi- Yonah, M. (1976), p. 59, s.v. Geba II, identified with Jaba\u02bb in Samaria (171192) and with reference to Mishnah Kelim 17:5. and Badan, fruits grown therein were still under the obligation to have all tithes separated therefrom before they could be eaten.Baden. See Mishnah (Kelim 17:5), explained by the sequel to the Mishnah, the Tosefta (Kelim - Baba Metzia 6:10), as belonging to the Samaritans: \u201cThey did not mention the pomegranates of B\u0101den nor the leeks of Geba\u02bb of the House of the Samaritans (Heb. K\u016bth\u012bm) except to say that they are tithed as produce [that went] certainly untithed.\u201d {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\" !
