During his first year, O'Meara barred officers from accepting rewards for routine action, replaced the disciplinary action of fining police officers with extra work assignments, forbid city hall officials from interfering with police business, eliminated bathhouse details, opposed veteran's preference for appointment to the police department, and issued new orders regarding his officers' use of firearms, arrest of juveniles, physical appearance.

His reappointment was opposed by a group of 150 Boston ministers, led by Willard Francis Mallalieu, as well as a group of South End women, who wanted public education activist Florence Page appointed to the position over the \"weak and inefficient\" O'Meara. His reappointment was endorsed by the Good Government Association as well as another group of Protestant clergy, which included Thomas Van Ness, Herbert S. Johnson, and Adolf A. Berle Sr. On May 31, Governor Foss reappointed O'Meara.
