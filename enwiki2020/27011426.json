Additionally, the episode \"still provided a few big laughs and helped move some of the character development forward\". Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a lukewarm review, saying only that \"I loved the Cam/Mitchell story of who wants to work and who wants to stay home, [but] the cringe-factor of the party was a little too much for me\". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+ saying the episode \"stumbled\". \"Clumsy exposition, inconsistent timing, and a lost opportunity at a big setpiece\" added up to the episode's performance as \"middling at best\". Jason Hughes of The TV Squad called Claire's (Julie Bowen) dressing down of Alex \"hilarious but brutal.\" Summing up the show's first season so far, Hughes stated \"[a]fter this first season, I'd say the show is making a pretty strong case for itself\" as one of the greatest comedies of all time. James Poniewozik of Time said \"After the travesty that was the iPad episode (which mercifully aired while I was on vacation), Modern Family was back with an episode that hit on pretty much every subplot, explored some new combinations of characters while offering fresh takes on old ones and proved the maxim: if you have a revolving driveway in the first act, it had better go off by the end of the third.\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.8/5 stating that it was \"one of the best episodes in Modern Family history combined humor and sweetness, while eliminating the sap.\" ==References== ==External links== *\"Benched\" at ABC.com * * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Modern Family (season 1) episodes ",
