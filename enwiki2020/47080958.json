Particularly head of the family Sweeney, a frustrated drummer who decides to start up his own band. Everybody begins spending money. Sweeney's wife Elsie enrolls in an art school, eager to become a painter. Her brother Doc begins gambling on horse races. Off to an expensive finishing school goes the Pattersons' daughter, Mary, while son Junior is enrolled in a military academy. Grandpa Casey looks on with disapproval, believing the family should be more careful with its new windfall. Sure enough, things go wrong. Sweeney takes a shine to a young woman called Yolo, who joins the band and immediately creates problems, her jealous jailbird boyfriend even punching Sweeney in the nose. Elsie's art teacher disappears with her tuition fee. Mary's new beau Johnny Jordan and his father are appalled by the family's behavior, and she ends up expelled from school. Bit by bit, the family goes broke. Grandpa gives them an \"I told you so.\" But after he wins a small cash prize himself, the family begins once again thinking big. == Cast == == References == == External links == * Category:1936 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Nick Grinde Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1936 comedy films Category:1939 comedy films Category:1939 films ",
