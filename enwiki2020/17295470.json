This was a rematch of the previous season's Western Conference Finals, which Colorado won in six games. This was Detroit's third straight and fifth overall conference finals appearance, while it was Colorado's fourth trip to conference finals in franchise history. The rivalry between the two teams was as heated as ever after the events of a brawl during a game on March 26th still fresh. The Red Wings played a determined Game 1 as Brendan Shanahan broke a scoreless tie at 1:13 of the third period to give Detroit a 1\u20130 lead. Joe Sakic scored just 27 seconds later and Mike Ricci added another at 6:13 gave Colorado a 2\u20131 lead that they would not relinquish. In Game 2, Colorado led 2\u20130 but Detroit pulled to within one on a power-play goal by Igor Larionov at 16:51 of the second period. The Red Wings then went on to score three times in the third period to win 4\u20132 and tie the series at one game apiece. In Game 3, the Red Wings got two goals from Vyacheslav Kozlov and went on to win 2\u20131. Detroit also won Game 4, 6\u20130. Red Wings goaltender Mike Vernon made 19 saves in the shutout and Igor Larionov and Kirk Maltby both scored twice. Detroit now led the series three games to one. Embarrassed and frustrated after such a lopsided loss in Game 4, Colorado came right back in Game 5 with a 6\u20130 win of their own, with Patrick Roy stopping all 32 shots he faced. Claude Lemieux and Joe Sakic both scored two goals in the victory. In Game 6, the Red Wings looked to close out the series. Sergei Fedorov's goal at 6:11 of the third period gave Detroit a 2\u20130 lead. Scott Young pulled Colorado to within one on a goal at 14:48, but the Avalanche could not score the equalizer, and Brendan Shanahan sealed the game and series for Detroit with an empty net goal at 19:30. ==Stanley Cup Finals== This was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams.
