He was the commander of a partisans Brigade of the VII Divisione Autonoma Monferrato and was decorated with the Italian bronze medal. His academic career took him to a variety of institutions, but he was primarily based at the Sapienza University of Rome from 1966 to 1990. ==Biography== Sergio Cotta was born to Alberto Cotta, who was a scholar of forestry sciences, and Mary Nicolis di Robilant, of the aristocratic Robilant family. A direct descendant of the mathematician Leonhard Euler, he studied in Florence at the La Querce Barnabiti Institute and then enrolled at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Florence where he graduated in 1945. On 8 September 1943, in Friuli, he was called to arms with the rank of Lieutenant, after the signing of the Italian armistice. With the German army losing, he sailed along the Adriatic to reach unoccupied Italy. After catching malaria, and several other trials, he reached Piedmont, where he was posted to the partisan brigade, the 7th Autonomous Division \"Monferrato\", as the commander of the 2nd Brigade. He was among the first to enter Turin on the days of liberation. For his participation in the Italian resistance movement, on 24 September 1951, he was awarded the Bronze Medal of Military Valor and 31 March 1952, the War Cross. In 1945 he married Brozolo Elisabetta Radicati of Brozolo. The couple went on to have three children: Irene, Maurizio, and Gabriella. ===Academic career=== He started his career at the University of Turin as assistant to Norberto Bobbio.

From the 1950s he published many articles and monographs on the political vision of Montesquieu, Gaetano Filangieri, St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine, devoting himself to theoretical reflections on law and politics.
