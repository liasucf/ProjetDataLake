    "text": "The Fake Sound of Progress (stylized as thefakesoundofprogress) is the debut studio album by the Welsh rock band Lostprophets, originally released on 27 November 2000 through Visible Noise. The album would be released in 2001 by Columbia Records and was met with stronger sales numbers around the world. This is the only album to feature DJ Stepzak although he was only in the original version, and the first album to have Jamie Oliver although he was only in the remastered version. The album peaked at number 186 on the Billboard 200, selling over 120,000 copies in the United States alone, and reached high positions on charts worldwide. Two singles were released from the album: \"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\" and \"The Fake Sound of Progress\"; these singles helped Lostprophets reach mainstream popularity. In 2010, the album was certified platinum by the BPI in the United Kingdom. == Style == The Fake Sound of Progress is a nu metal album (October 8th, 2001). Retrieved on September 14th, 2015 that incorporates elements of heavy metal, hip hop, funk and jazz. == Recording == The band began work on the album in 2000, after finding a suitable bass player. Much of the album started as quickly-recorded demos from The Fake Sound of Progress EP. The song \"MOAC Supreme\" became \"A Thousand Apologies\", and \"Directions\" was released as the B-side for the single \"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\". The album was recorded in one week for around \u00a34000, and while originally intended as another demo, went on to be released on Visible Noise Records in late 2000. Because of the album's shortened recording process, the band were unhappy with the end result. The title of their second studio album Start Something refers to this, as they felt it better reflected their music abilities. When the band signed to Columbia Records in 2001, it was partly re-recorded, remixed, and re-released that same year. The changes to the music, such as merging the interludes between tracks with the ends of songs, was met with chagrin by fans of the earlier release. The title track of the album, in addition to being partially re-recorded, was also sped up significantly. The remastered version of the album was released in 2001 in the UK and US respectively, and was produced by Michael Barbiero.Inner liner notes, The Fake Sound of Progress, UK release from Visible Noise == Release == The album didn't initially receive much attention, but entered the Billboard 200 chart following the release of the first single from the album, \"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\".
