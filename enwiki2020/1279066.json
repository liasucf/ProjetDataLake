    "text": "\"Danny Boy\" is a ballad, written by English songwriter Frederic Weatherly in 1913, and set to the traditional Irish melody of \"Londonderry Air\". ==History== 1940 recording by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra on RCA Bluebird, B-10612-B In 1910, in Bath, Somerset, the English lawyer and lyricist Frederic Weatherly initially wrote the words to \"Danny Boy\" to a tune other than \"Londonderry Air\". After his Irish-born sister-in-law Margaret Enright Weatherly (known as Jess) in the United States sent him a copy of \"Londonderry Air\" in 1913 (an alternative version of the story has her singing the air to him in 1912 with different lyrics), Weatherly modified the lyrics of \"Danny Boy\" to fit the rhyme and meter of \"Londonderry Air\".In Sunshine And In Shadow: The family story of Danny Boy by Anthony Mann (Weatherly's great grandson) Weatherly gave the song to the vocalist Elsie Griffin, who made it one of the most popular songs in the new century. In 1915, Ernestine Schumann- Heink produced the first recording of \"Danny Boy\". Jane Ross of Limavady is credited with collecting the melody of \"Londonderry Air\" in the mid-19th century from a musician she encountered.George Petrie: The Ancient Music of Ireland, 1855 == Lyrics == The 1913 lyrics by Frederick E. Weatherly: ==Meaning== Various suggestions exist as to the true meaning of \"Danny Boy\". Some have interpreted the song to be a message from a parent to a son going off to a war or uprising (as suggested by the reference to \"pipes calling glen to glen\") or leaving as part of the Irish diaspora. The 1918 version of the sheet music with Weatherly's printed signature included alternative lyrics (\"Eily Dear\"), with the instructions that \"when sung by a man, the words in italic should be used; the song then becomes \"Eily Dear\", so that \"Danny Boy\" is only to be sung by a lady\". In spite of this, it is unclear whether this was Weatherly's intent. The song has been performed by a diverse range of male singers, including Irish tenor John McCormack, Jim Reeves, Mario Lanza, Bing Crosby, Andy Williams, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, Sam Cooke, Elvis Presley, Shane MacGowan, Jackie Wilson, Daniel O'Donnell, Harry Belafonte, Tom Jones, John Gary, Frank Patterson, Thomas Quasthoff, Stuart Burrows, Jacob Collier, Harry Connick Jr., and comedian Peter Kay amongst many others. All used the original lyrics with slight variations. ==Usage== * The song is popular for funerals; but, as it is not liturgical, its suitability as a funeral song is sometimes contested.No byline (2001-08-10), \"'Danny Boy' cannot be played during Mass\". National Catholic Reporter. 37 (36):11 In 1928, Weatherly himself suggested that the second verse would provide a fitting requiem for the actress Ellen Terry. * Figure skating world champion Javier Fern\u00e1ndez skated an exhibition programme to Danny Boy choreographed by David Wilson, which Fern\u00e1ndez debuted in Boston, US following his victory at the 2016 World Figure Skating Championships. * Opera singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming sang \"Danny Boy\" at the funeral service for Senator John McCain on 1 September 2018. ==Adaptations== Southern gospel singer Dottie Rambo adapted the melody for her song, \"He Looked Beyond My Fault and Saw My Need\", which was also notably sung by George Beverly Shea. The American Celtic rock band, Black 47 uses the classic song in their original song Danny Boy which tells the story of a gay Irish immigrant in New York City while an instrumental version of \"Danny Boy\" plays hauntingly in the background. When the main character of dies of AIDS, the band finally sings an abbreviated version of \"Danny Boy\" with the lyrics now seeming between two male lovers. ==Notable recordings== \"Danny Boy\" has been recorded multiple times by a variety of performers.
