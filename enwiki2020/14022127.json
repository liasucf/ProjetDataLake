    "text": "The 1994\u201395 Philadelphia Flyers season was the Philadelphia Flyers 28th season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flyers made the playoffs for the first time since 1989, also winning their division for the first time since 1987, and made it to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing in six games to the New Jersey Devils. ==Off-season== Bob Clarke was named president and general manager of the Flyers on June 15, 1994, replacing Russ Farwell. The Florida Panthers received the Flyers' 1994 second-round pick and cash, believed to be around $500,000, as compensation since Clarke had to be released from his contract. On June 24, Clarke hired Terry Murray to replace Terry Simpson as head coach. A former Flyers player, Murray had mostly recently coached the Cincinnati Cyclones of the International Hockey League after being fired midway through the 1993\u201394 season as the Washington Capitals head coach. Prior to the start of training camp, the team announced Eric Lindros was replacing Kevin Dineen as team captain. The Flyers made three major player transactions during the off-season prior to the beginning of the 1994\u201395 NHL lockout. On June 29, the Flyers swapped defensemen with the Montreal Canadiens, sending Yves Racine to Montreal for Kevin Haller. On July 6, unrestricted free agent centerman Craig MacTavish, formerly of the Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers, was signed to a two-year, $1.6 million contract. On September 22, the Flyers re-acquired goaltender Ron Hextall, whom they had traded in 1992 to the Quebec Nordiques in the Lindros trade, from the New York Islanders for goaltender Tommy Soderstrom. ==Regular season== After a 3\u20136\u20131 start to the season, including a shutout loss to Ottawa on February 6, Clarke dealt high-scoring winger Mark Recchi to the Montreal Canadiens for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair. In the following game, at home against Florida, the team lost 3\u20130, but Lindros and LeClair was placed on a line with sophomore forward Mikael Renberg to form the \"Legion of Doom\" line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. The line registered its first point on Saturday, February 11, 1995, in a game against the New Jersey Devils at the Meadowlands. The line made an immediate impact, as it helped the Flyers defeat the Devils 3\u20131. Less than two weeks later, on Thursday, February 23, Lindros recorded a hat trick in what would be his final game in Quebec City against the Nordiques, but the Flyers wasted a three-goal lead into a 6\u20136 tie. Two nights later in Montreal, LeClair blitzed his former club in his return with a hat-trick in a 7\u20130 rout which saw the Flyers score five times in the third period. LeClair's previous hat trick had come just 11 days earlier in a 5\u20132 Flyers' win at Tampa Bay. Lindros recorded two more hat tricks during the regular season, and both came in consecutive games; his second one on March 18 in a 4\u20133 Flyers' overtime win in Florida, and the third on March 20 in an 8\u20134 Flyers' win over the Montreal Canadiens. Josef Beranek had the other Flyers' regular-season hat trick in a 5\u20134 overtime loss to the New York Islanders on February 2. During the season, the Flyers had two long winning streaks: one was eight games from March 5\u201320, the other was nine games from April 2\u201322. The final contest in that streak, on April 22 at New Jersey, saw LeClair net the overtime winner which clinched the Atlantic Division. Even though it was scored 54 seconds into the overtime period, it would prove to be the fastest overtime goal scored in the lockout-shortened regular season.https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1995_games.html The end of the season saw Lindros go down with an eye injury in the penultimate game against the New York Rangers, as a shot he took ricocheted off Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom and struck him in the face. The playoff drought was finally over as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the No.2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Lindros, who scored 70 points, came in second to Jaromir Jagr by a tiebreaker in the race for the Art Ross Trophy, the NHL scoring championship, but was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. ===Season standings=== ==Playoffs== Lindros missed the first three games of the Flyers' Eastern Conference quarterfinal series against the Buffalo Sabres. Karl Dykhuis netted the overtime winner in Game 1 and the club took a 2\u20130 series lead on the road. Following a narrow Game 3 defeat at The Aud, Lindros returned and the reunited Legion led the club to a 4\u20132 win. In Game 5, Philly rolled to leads of 4\u20130 and 5\u20132 before closing with a 6\u20134 victory. More overtime magic came in the semifinal series with the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, who upset the Nordiques in the first round. Game 1 at the Spectrum saw New York race out to a 3\u20131 lead, only to see the Flyers storm back to go up 4\u20133. A late goal from Pat Verbeek sent the game into an extra session, where Desjardins won it with a right-circle shot. The next night, Brian Leetch recorded a hat-trick but Kevin Haller struck with under 30 seconds played in OT off a feed from Renberg to give the Flyers a 4\u20133 win and 2\u20130 series edge. The Flyers capitalized on multiple mistakes and turnovers in Games 3 and 4 at Madison Square Garden, recording 5-2 and 4-1 victories to sweep the series. The Flyers advanced to the conference finals against the Devils. Jersey controlled long stretches of the first two games, winning 4\u20131 in Game 1 and overcoming an early deficit with a four-goal blitz to take Game 2, 5\u20132. The Devils were on the verge of going up three games to none at the Meadowlands, but a Rod Brind'Amour floater in the third period and Lindros' wrister in overtime brought the Flyers back. Philly controlled Game 4 and coasted to a 4\u20132 win, but the Devils continued to use the neutral zone trap to control the Legion in Game 5. Although Dineen scored early in the third to tie the game, Claude Lemieux's 50-foot blast got by Hextall and gave New Jersey the shocking 3\u20132 win and left the Devils one win away from the Cup finals. In Game 6, Jim Montgomery got the Flyers on the board early in the first period, but the Devils stormed back with four consecutive scores to ice the game and the series 4\u20132. ==Schedule and results== ===Regular season=== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text- align:center;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 5px solid; border-bottom:#000 5px solid;\"| 1994\u201395 regular season |- valign=\"top\" | January: 2\u20134\u20131 (Home: 2\u20131\u20130; Road: 0\u20133\u20131) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" !
