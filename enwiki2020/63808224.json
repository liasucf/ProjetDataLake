    "text": "Moriba Kourouma Kourouma (born 19 January 2003), known as Ilaix Moriba, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Barcelona B as a central midfielder. Born in Guinea, Moriba represents Spain internationally.A highly creative player in midfield,he has drawn comparisons to French footballer Paul Pogba and Italian legend Andrea Pirlo due to his capability to direct the game deep from midfield. == Biography == Moriba was born in Conakry, Guinea, from a Guinean mother and a Liberian father. He holds both Spanish and Guinean citizenship. ==Club career== Moriba arrived at FC Barcelona in 2010. He has been considered as one of the best players of his generation, and he has very often played in categories of players far older than him. Moriba really stood out at age 15 when he scored a hat-trick against the Real Madrid U19's. Most remarkable was perhaps his last goal where he literally scored just at the start of the second half, from the middle of the pitch. In January 2019, as his junior contract was about to come to an end, clubs such as Manchester City or Juventus tried to sign the player, but he eventually came to sign a record deal for such a young player in La Masia academy, with a salary of more than \u20ac500,000 a year and a buyout clause set at \u20ac100 million. During the following season he became a regular for Barcelona B, scoring his first goal in a 3-2 victory against Llagostera CF. ==International career== Ilaix is a youth international with Spain, but both the Guinean and Liberian football federations have reportedly tried to get him to switch nationality. It appeared the young eventually chose to play for the Guinea national team, being set to make his debut on the international stage in June 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic froze the 2020 football season. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2003 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Guinean footballers Category:Guinean people of Liberian descent Category:Guinean emigrants to Spain Category:Spanish people of Guinean descent Category:Spanish people of Liberian descent Category:Association football midfielders Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:FC Barcelona B players Category:Sportspeople from Conakry ",
