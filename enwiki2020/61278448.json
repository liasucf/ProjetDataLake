He was raised in a very spiritual environment with high Islamic values and ethics. == Biography == Sidi Boushaki Ez-Zaouaoui was born in 1394 in A\u00efth A\u00efcha, at Tizi Na\u00efth A\u00efcha, in the Khechna massif, an extension of Djurdjura. He began his studies in the village of Soum\u00e2a (Thala Oufella) in Th\u00e9nia in 1398 , before joining B\u00e9ja\u00efa in 1404 , very young, to continue his studies. There he studied the Quran and the Maliki fiqh as a pupil with \"Ali Menguelleti\", a recognized theologian from Kabylie. B\u00e9ja\u00efa was then at the beginning of the fifteenth century a religious center and a place of influence of Sufism. He made his destination in 1415 to Tunis, where he deepened his knowledge of Maliki Madhhab. There he studied the tafsir of the Quran at the judge Abu Abdallah Al Kalchani, and he received the Maliki fiqh from Yaakub Ez-Zaghbi. He was a student of Abdelwahed Al Fariani in the foundations (Oussoul) of Islam. He returned in 1420 to the mountains of B\u00e9ja\u00efa where he deepened in Arabic at Abd El Aali Ibn Ferradj. He went to Constantine in 1423 where he lived for many years, and he received the teachings in the Muslim faith (Aslain) and logic in \"Abu Zeid Abderrahmane\", nicknamed \"El Bez\". He studied prose, verse, fiqh and the majority of the theological sciences of the time at Ibn Marzuq El Hafid (1365 - 1439), the Maghreb and Tlemcen scholar who had visited Constantine to preach his knowledge, not to be confused with his father Ibn Marzuq El Khatib (1310 - 1379). He joined Mecca for pilgrimage and study. He died in 1453, and was buried in the Thenia Mountains in his native Kabyle tribe == References == Category:1394 births Category:1453 deaths Category:14th-century Berber people Category:Algerian Sufi saints Category:Berber scholars Category:15th-century Berber people ",
