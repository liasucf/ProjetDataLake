    "text": "A syntractrix is a curve of the form :x+\\sqrt{b^2-y^2}= a \\ln \\frac{b+\\sqrt{b^2-y^2}}{y}.George Salmon (1879). A Treatise on the Higher Plane Curves: Intended as a Sequel to A Treatise on Conic Sections. Published by Hodges, Foster, and Figgis. Page 290. The syntractrix for a=0.5 and b=1. The syntractrix for a=1.5 and b=1. It is the locus of a point on the tangent of a tractrix at a constant distance from the point of tangency, as the point of tangency is moved along the curve.Dionysius Lardner, A system of algebraic geometry 1823, p. 261\u2013263 ==References== Category:Curves ",
