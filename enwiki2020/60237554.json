The Justice struggled throughout the first three stages of the season, posting a 2\u201319 record in the first 21 games. However, the Justice flourished after the League's implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock for Stage 4, as the team lost only one match in their final seven games to finish the season in 17th place with an 8\u201320 record. == Preceding offseason == On September 12, Washington announced the signing of former New York Excelsior coach Kim \"WizardHyeong\" Hyeong-seok as the team's head coach.

Washington fell to a quick 0\u20132 deficit after losing on Ilios and King's Row, but the team was subsequently able to full-hold New York on the third map, Horizon Lunar Colony, en route to winning the map; however, the Justice lost on last map, Rialto, to lose the series 1\u20133. The next week, the Justice first took on the 2018 champions London Spitfire. Washington came out strong, winning the first two maps to go up 2\u20130 going into halftime. They would not be able to close out the match, as Washington yielded the next three consecutive maps fall 2\u20133. The team's next match was against the Philadelphia Fusion on February 28. After winning the first map, Ilios, the Justice lost three maps in a row to fall in the series by a score of 1\u20133. Two days later, the team took on the San Francisco Shock. Washington was dominated throughout the entirety of the match \u2013 even yielding the fastest completion time on Numbani in OWL history \u2013 and was swept 0\u20134. Washington faced the Seoul Dynasty a week later. An uncoordinated effort led the team to losing the first three maps, guaranteeing a match loss, but they were able to win the final map, Dorado, to lose the series 1\u20133. In the final week of Stage 1, the Justice first took on the Paris Eternal on March 16. Washington fell in the first map, Busan, and was able to force a tie on King's Row to enter halftime down 0\u20131.

The Justice opened Stage 2 with a match against the Toronto Defiant on April 5. Washington failed to get a single point on both Lijiang Tower and Hanamura to enter halftime down 0\u20132. A loss on Blizzard World solidified the loss; they picked up a win on Junkertown to lose the match by a 1\u20133 scoreline. Two days later, Washington faced the Chengdu Hunters. In response to Chengdu's unconventional compositions, the Justice also veered away from the typical triple tank, triple support composition. The match saw an Overwatch League record 27-of-30 heroes played for more than a minute across the four maps. Washington was only able to find one map win in the series, as they fell by a score of 1\u20133. In week two, the Justice took on the undefeated New York Excelsior on April 11. Washington failed to find a map win in the series and were swept 0\u20134 for the second time of the season. Two days later, the team faced the Atlanta Reign. The Justice fell on Busan and full-held Atlanta on the second map, Paris, en route to tying the series 1\u20131 heading into halftime.

On April 19, the Justice acquired acquired support Nikola \"Sleepy\" Andrews from the San Francisco Shock.

While the Justice fell convincingly in map one, Oasis, the team was able to force a draw on map two, Volskaya Industries, to head into halftime down 0\u20131.

The Justice had only one match in week four, as well, against the Houston Outlaws on June 28. After losing the first map and tying on the second, the Justice lost the final two to lose the match by a 0\u20133 scoreline. For the final week of Stage 3, Washington headed to the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta to play at the \"Atlanta Reign Homestand Weekend\". Their first match at the homestand was against the Philadelphia Fusion on July 6. Both teams mirrored each other's composition throughout the match, but the Justice were unable to come out on top, as the game ended with a 1\u20133 loss for Washington. The following day, the team took on the Guangzhou Charge. The stage ended on a low note for they Justice, as they were swept 0\u20134 by the Charge to give Washington a winless Stage 3 record. === Stage 4 === Prior to the start of Stage 4, which would include the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the League, the Justice signed tanks Elliot \"ELLIVOTE\" Vaneryd and Lukas \"LullSiSH\" Wiklund from the Dallas Fuel's academy team Team Envy. The Justice's first match of Stage 4 was against the Toronto Defiant on July 26; Washington came out of the match with a 3\u20131 victory. The following week, Washington took on the Florida Mayhem on August 1.

The win gave the Justice their first ever winning streak. Three days later, the team took on the league-leading Vancouver Titans. In a major upset, the Justice handed the Titans their first ever 0\u20134 loss and only their second loss in the entire regular season. DPS Corey \"Corey\" Nigra led the Justice throughout the match and broke the Overwatch League record for critical hit accuracy on Hanzo. Looking to continue their dominance in the new 2-2-2 meta, Washington next took on the Boston Uprising on August 9. Fueled by the continued stellar play from DPS Corey, the red-hot Justice proved too much to handle, as they took down Boston by a score of 3\u20131. Two days later, the team faced the Houston Outlaws. After the teams split the first four maps, the match went to a fifth tiebreaker map. The Justice came out on top and won the match 3\u20132 to continue their undefeated Stage 4 record.
