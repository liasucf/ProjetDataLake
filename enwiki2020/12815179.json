    "text": "Shelley Goodman Taub (born July 14, 1939) is a Republican politician from Oakland County, Michigan. She resides in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. ==Biography== Taub was born in Detroit in 1939. She received a B.A. in Education from the University of Michigan. She also did post-graduate work at the University of Missouri and University of Kansas. She is religiously Jewish.https://mdoe.state.mi.us/legislators/Legislator/LegislatorDetail/4420 She taught elementary school for 30 years and managed her husband's medical practice. She now has three children and five grandchildren. ==Political career== ===County Commissioner=== Taub served on the Oakland County Commission from 1993 until 2002 and again from 2009 to the present. She represents two-thirds of West Bloomfield Township, one-third of Bloomfield Township, and the cities of Keego Harbor, Orchard Lake Village and Sylvan Lake. As commissioner she chaired many activities including the Prescription Task Force, the Children's Summit and the Senior Summit. ===State Representative=== ====Legislative History==== Taub was elected to represent the 40th District in the Michigan House of Representatives in 2002. The district includes Bloomfield and Southfield townships; the cities of Birmingham Bloomfield Hills, Keego Harbor, Orchard Lake Village and Sylvan Lake; and the villages of Beverly Hills, Bingham Farms and Franklin. As a State Representative Taub focused on healthcare and education. In particular, Taub sponsored legislation capping malpractice suit contingency fees. ===2006 State Senate Campaign=== In 2006, Taub campaigned for a seat in the 13th District of the Michigan Senate. Originally, the Republican primary race was supposed to be between former her and former Rep. Robert Gosselin in a moderately safe Republican district. When Democrat Andy Levin entered the race, however, Republicans feared that his name recognition and fundraising ability (as the son of an Oakland County Congressman and nephew of Michigan's Senator) in the County could make the seat much more competitive. After John Pappageorge joined the race, Gosselin dropped out in order to run for County Commissioner in Troy. The competition between Pappageorge and Taub was characterized in the media as fierce. Taub claimed that if she had known that Pappageorge was going to run for the Senate, she would not have run. She put Pappageorge's name as an endorser on about 20,000 fliers that were sent throughout the district. She also claimed that Pappageorge received illegal support from the Senate GOP through the New Century Fund, a political action committee (PAC) without any campaign history that funded campaign material on behalf of Pappageorge. Pappageorge won the August Republican primary 58.5% to Taub's 41.5%. Shelley Goodman Taub was re-elected as Oakland County Commissioner in 2008, winning back her old seat. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Detroit Category:People from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan Category:University of Michigan School of Education alumni Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:University of Kansas alumni Category:Michigan Republicans Category:County commissioners in Michigan Category:Members of the Michigan House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Michigan ",
