Iggesund has a market share of about 20% in this sector. ==History== Iggesund is an industrial village in Sweden. Isak Breant Sr, a businessman and former court commissioner to Queen Kristina, established there a mill in 1685. Iggesunds Bruk (English:mill) was originally an ironworks, and the nearby forests were used to produce charcoal for the factory. In 1771, Iggesund Bruk acquired a small nearby company that made paper, \u00d6stan\u00e5 paper mill. It was one of the first to try to use sawdust and wood to produce paper. However, the technique remained experimental. The mill burnt down in 1842. In 1869, Baron Gustav Tamm became the owner of Iggesunds Bruk, and built a large sawmill. It was a major transformation for the factory, which had always been an ironworks. Iggesund\u2019s shares were first listed on Stockholmsb\u00f6rsen in 1949. Lars G. Sundblad introduced paperboard manufacturing at Iggesund, which started in 1963. The merger of MoDo, Holmen and Iggesund resulted in the delisting of Iggesund shares from Stockholmsb\u00f6rsen (1988), making Iggesund part of the holding, which was renamed to Holmen AB in 2000 Johannsson, Jessica: \"The History of Iggesunds Bruk\", 2001. ==Products== Iggesund Paperboard's product range consists of two product families: *Invercote, a solid bleached board (SBB, GZ) with a grammage of 180\u2013400 g/m\u00b2 and a thickness of 200-485 \u00b5m *Incada, folding box board (FBB, GC1 and GC2) with a grammage of 200\u2013350 g/m\u00b2 and a thickness of 305-640 \u00b5m ==Mills== Iggesunds bruk (1923) Iggesunds Bruk manufactures solid bleached board (SBB, GZ) for the Invercote range in Iggesund, Sweden. * two machines with an annual capacity of about 330,000 tons * produced 262,000 tons of paperboard in 2008 * certified in accordance with ISO 14001 and ISO 9001. * FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified * PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification ) certified Workington manufactures folding box board (FBB, GC1, GC2) for the Incada range in Workington, England * one machine with an annual capacity of 200,000 tons * produced 175,000 tons of paperboard in 2010 * certified in accordance with ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 also ISO 18,001 * FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified Str\u00f6ms Bruk produces plastic-coated and laminated paperboard on the basis of paperboard from Iggesund and Workington at a capacity of 40,000 tons/year in Str\u00f6msbruk, Sweden == Locations == Holmen's nursery, close to Friggesund Head Office: * Iggesund Paperboard AB, Iggesund, Sweden Sales Offices: * Iggesund Paperboard Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands * Iggesund Paperboard Asia (HK) Limited, Hong Kong * Iggesund Paperboard Asia Pte Ltd., Singapore * Iggesund Paperboard Inc.
