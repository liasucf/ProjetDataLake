N. Sneddon, 1984, Proto-Sangiric & the Sangiric languages pp 20, 23 as well as Nambikwara in Brazil (plain and laryngealized), Gaagudju in Australia, Pur\u00e9pecha and Western Rar\u00e1muri in Mexico, Moro in Sudan, O'odham and Mohawk in the United States, Chaga in Tanzania, and Kanuri in Nigeria. Various Dravidian and Indic languages of India are reported to have a retroflex lateral flap, either phonemically or phonetically, including Gujarati, Konkani, Marathi, Odia, and Rajasthani.* Masica describes the sound as widespread in the Indic languages of India: ==Dedicated symbol== There is no explicitly approved IPA symbol for the retroflex lateral flap. However, the expected symbol may be created by combining the symbol for the alveolar lateral flap with the tail of the retroflex consonants, Alveolar and retroflex lateral flaps. This was only accepted by Unicode in 2020, and so for now normal typography requires the use of a combining diacritic, . SIL International includes this symbol to the Private Use Areas of their Gentium Plus, Charis, and Doulos fonts, as U+F269 (). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Lateral consonants Category:Retroflex consonants Category:Flap consonants Category:Pulmonic consonants Category:Oral consonants ",
