Rakiti\u0107 started his professional career at Basel and spent two seasons with them before he was signed by Schalke 04. After spending three-and-a-half seasons in the Bundesliga, he was signed by Sevilla in January 2011. Two years later, Rakiti\u0107 was confirmed as the club captain and captained the team to UEFA Europa League triumph. In June 2014, Barcelona and Sevilla reached an agreement on the transfer of Rakiti\u0107. In his first season with Bar\u00e7a, he won the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League. He scored the first goal of the 2015 Champions League Final and became the first player ever to win the Champions League a year after winning the Europa League while playing for two clubs. After appearing in more than 300 games and winning ten more trophies with Barcelona, Rakiti\u0107 returned to Sevilla in 2020. Born in Switzerland to parents from Croatia, Rakiti\u0107 played for Switzerland at youth level, but decided to represent Croatia at senior level. He made his debut for Croatia in 2007 and has since represented the country at the UEFA Euro 2008, 2012 and 2016, and the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, reaching the final of the latter. He retired from international duty in September 2020, having made 106 appearances. At the time of his retirement, he was fourth most capped player in the history of Croatia. ==Early life== Rakiti\u0107 was born in Rheinfelden in the Swiss canton of Aargau to Croatian parents. His father, Luka, and his family are originally from Sikirevci in Croatia, while his mother's family are Bosnian Croats from \u017dep\u010de. He grew up in M\u00f6hlin, canton of Aargau. He has a brother, Dejan. Rakiti\u0107 has a tattoo bearing his brother's name on his right arm. Rakiti\u0107 spent his childhood and early career in Switzerland. His father and older brother were also footballers. At age 16, his potential was noticed by top European scouts, but he and his family decided to stay in Basel to allow him to play more regularly in a smaller league instead. ==Club career== ===Basel=== After spending some short time in the youth teams, Rakiti\u0107 went on to make his first-team debut for Basel on 29 September 2005 during the UEFA Cup away match at \u0160iroki Brijeg. He made his first Swiss Super League appearance on 15 April 2006 in Basel's away match against Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax. Although these two matches were the only ones he played during his first professional season with Basel, he went on to establish himself as a regular contributor in his second season, scoring 11 goals in 33 Super League appearances. Also making nine UEFA cup appearances during this time, he was named the best young player of the 2006\u201307 Super League season along with receiving the Swiss Goal of the Year award for an impressive goal he scored against St. Gallen on 22 October 2006. ===Schalke 04=== Rakiti\u0107 with Schalke in 2010 After an impressive showing as a teenager, Rakiti\u0107 was again sought by large European clubs. Subject to such, he was eventually signed by German side Schalke 04 on 22 June 2007, for \u20ac5 million. Rakiti\u0107 made his debut for Schalke on 21 July 2007 in the Premiere Ligapokal fixture against Karlsruher SC and eventually appeared in the remaining two matches as Schalke finished as league runners-up. On 5 August 2007, Rakiti\u0107 scored his first competitive goal for his new club in their 0\u20139 away win over Eintracht Trier in the first round of the DFB-Pokal. On 10 August 2007, the new Bundesliga season was commenced with a clash between champions VfB Stuttgart and Schalke. Rakiti\u0107 came on as a second-half substitute and scored his first Bundesliga goal within just seven minutes on the field as his side played out a 2\u20132 draw. On 15 September 2007, he managed to make impressions again by scoring the only goal for Schalke in their 1\u20131 away draw at Bayern Munich. Three days later, Rakiti\u0107 made his UEFA Champions League debut in the 0\u20131 home defeat to Valencia. He then went on to make a total of seven appearances in the 2007\u201308 Champions League season, including a strong and very impressive midfield role in Schalke's home fixture against Chelsea in the group stage. He and former teammate Mladen Krstaji\u0107 were temporarily cut from the squad the night before Schalke's next fixture against Rosenborg due to being caught skipping training and taking part in a late-night partying. Helping his side prevail in the penalty shootout against Porto to reach the quarter-finals for the first time, Rakiti\u0107 had to miss both the fixtures of such against Chelsea due to an ankle injury sustained in training. He was kept out of action for a month as Schalke were eliminated from the tournament without him. Shortly upon his returning from injury, Rakiti\u0107 discovered top form as he scored a goal and assisted another two in the vital 0\u20133 victory at VfL Bochum, which made sure Schalke finished at least third in league table and secured a place in the next Champions League. He continued such form in the next fixture against Eintracht Frankfurt, assisting Mladen Krstaji\u0107 for the only goal of the match to conclude with Schalke a positive home season. In total, he finished his first Bundesliga season with 3 goals and 10 assists in 29 appearances.

I > am convinced that we still have a great team with a bright future ahead. I > wish my friends and teammates all the luck in the world for the upcoming > challenges, and in me they will have the biggest fan. ==Style of play== A talented, intelligent, and hard-working midfielder, Rakiti\u0107 is known in the media as a well-rounded playmaker, with good stamina and defensive skills, as well as excellent technique, close control, vision, passing, and an ability to read the game, which enables him to dictate play in midfield and create chances for teammates after winning back possession, despite his lack of pace. As such, he is capable of both breaking down opposing plays and subsequently transitioning the ball forward to start attacks; he is also capable of scoring goals himself, courtesy of his striking ability from distance, as well as his ability to find and exploit spaces with his movement off the ball and make attacking runs into the box. A versatile player, he is capable of playing in several midfield positions, and has been deployed as a winger on either side of the pitch, as a central midfielder, as an attacking midfielder, as a defensive midfielder, in a box-to-box role, or even as a deep-lying playmaker. In 2019, in an interview with BeIN Sports, manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho described Rakiti\u0107 as \"one of the most underrated players in the world.\" He later added: \"He is fantastic on all levels; he defends, he compensates for [Lionel] Messi, he runs and he's sensible with the ball at his feet.\" ==Personal life== Rakiti\u0107 married Raquel Mauri in April 2013 in Seville after two years of dating. Rakiti\u0107 initially met her on the first night he arrived in Seville in the summer of 2011, at a hotel bar, and attributed his fluent learning of Spanish, to his repeated attempts to take her out on a date. In July 2013, their daughter Althea was born. In May 2016, their second daughter, Adara, was born. He speaks Croatian, German, Spanish, English, French and Italian. In late June 2016, Rakiti\u0107 rented a villa on the island of Ugljan, where he arrived on vacation with his family. On 1 July, the house was allegedly attacked by a group of six men who threw rocks at it, breaking several windows and forcing Rakiti\u0107 and his family to literally flee the island on a speedboat. However, Slobodna Dalmacija reporters investigated the event and discovered that only one window was broken by an unknown perpetrator, and that Rakiti\u0107 rather calmly left the island hours later, giving autographs to the local fans. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|CupIncludes cup competitions such as the Swiss Cup, DFB-Pokal and Copa del Rey !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Basel |2005\u201306 |rowspan=\"2\"| Super League |1||0||1||0||1Appearances in UEFA Cup||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||3||0 |- |2006\u201307 |33||11||5||0||9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||47||11 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!11!!6!!0!!10!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!50!!11 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Schalke 04 |2007\u201308 |rowspan=\"4\"| Bundesliga |29||3||3||1||7Appearances in UEFA Champions League||0||3Appearances in DFL-Ligapokal||0||42||4 |- |2008\u201309 |23||1||4||1||7Two appearances in UEFA Champions League and five appearances and one goal in UEFA Cup||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||34||3 |- |2009\u201310 |29||7||4||0||colspan=\"4\"|\u2013||33||7 |- |2010\u201311 |16||1||4||1||5||0||1Appearances in DFL-Supercup||0||26||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !97!!12!!15!!3!!19!!1!!4!!0!!135!!16 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Sevilla |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"4\"| La Liga |13||6||1||0||2Appearances in UEFA Europa League||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||16||6 |- |2011\u201312 |36||0||3||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||39||1 |- |2012\u201313 |34||9||8||3||colspan=\"4\"|\u2013||42||12 |- |2013\u201314 |34||12||0||0||18||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||52||15 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !117!!27!!12!!4!!20!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!149!!34 |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Barcelona |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"6\"| La Liga |32||5||7||1||12||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||51||8 |- |2015\u201316 |36||7||6||0||10||2||5Two appearances in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, one appearance in UEFA Super Cup, two appearances in FIFA Club World Cup||0||57||9 |- |2016\u201317 |32||8||8||1||9||0||2Appearances in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a||0||51||9 |- |2017\u201318 |35||1||8||2||10||1||2||0||55||4 |- |2018\u201319 |34||3||7||1||12||1||1||0||54||5 |- |2019\u201320 |31||1||3||0||7||0||1||0||42||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !200!!25!!39!!5!!60!!6!!11!!0!!310!!36 |- |Sevilla |2020\u201321 |La Liga |4||1||0||0||1||0||1||0||6||1 |- ! colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !452!!76!!72!!12!!110!!10!!16!!0!!650!!98 |} ;Notes ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"13\"|Croatia||2007|||5||1 |- |2008|||11||4 |- |2009||8||2 |- |2010||8||1 |- |2011||6||0 |- |2012||10||1 |- |2013||11||0 |- |2014||10||0 |- |2015||6||1 |- |2016||7||3 |- |2017||6||0 |- |2018||14||2 |- |2019||4||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total||106||15 |} ===International goals=== :Croatia score listed first, score column indicates score after each Rakiti\u0107 goal. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" !
