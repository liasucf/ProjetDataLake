    "text": "Giovanni Paderna (17th century) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He trained with Girolamo Curti, became an accomplished imitator of Agostino Mitelli, the pre-eminent quadratura painter from Bologna. Paderna became a colleague of Baldassare Bianchi; and the latter, at the death of Paderna, having become Mitelli's son-in-law, was placed by the father-in-law to work with Giovanni Giacomo Monti. He died at age 40 years. ==References== * Category:People from Bologna Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Bolognese painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Quadratura painters Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown ",
