As of 2011 census, it has a population of 1,955 inhabitants. ==Name== The name of the village in Serbian is in the plural, and therefore it is grammatically correct to refer to it as \"Kukujevci are\" instead of \"Kukujevci is\". A hypothetical singular version of the name would be Kukujevac. ==History== Roman Catholic Church in Kukujevci Prior to the Yugoslav Wars, the population of the village was 89% Croat.1995/06/12 22:25 GLAVOM U PESAK During the Yugoslav Wars and particularly as a spillover from the Croatian War of Independence local Croat community in Kukujevci was exposed to harassment and persecution by Serbian nationalists leading to community's expulsion from the village. As a consequence of the war demographic structure of the village is today almost entirely different with 90% of population being ethnic Serbs, mostly Serb refugees who left after the collapse of the self-proclaimed SAO Western Slavonia or from other parts of Croatia.
