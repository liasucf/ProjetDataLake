    "text": "The British Rail Class 58 is a class of Co-Co diesel locomotive designed for heavy freight. Introduced in 1983, they followed American practice of modularisation. EWS withdrew them in 2002 after 19 years in service, and 32 were hired abroad \u2013 four to the Netherlands, eight to Spain and twenty to France. == History == In the late 1970s, British Rail wanted to develop a new, low-cost, easily maintainable freight locomotive that would handle the predicted rail freight growth during the 1980s. The Class 56 had a troublesome entry into service, and BR was also keen to enter the export market. Pre- production drawings of the Class 58s referred to them as \"Standard Export Locomotives\". Once a design for the new Class 58 had been approved by the British Railways Board, the contract to build the locomotives was awarded to British Rail Engineering Limited's (BREL) Doncaster Works where work started on a major multi-million pound upgrade of 'E2' shop where the locomotives would be manufactured. BREL dropped traditional locomotive construction methods in favour of an entirely new approach \u2013 an innovative modular design. This offered savings on construction and maintenance compared to previous locomotive builds. The load-bearing underframe was fitted with exchangeable modules \u2013 number 1 cab, radiator, power unit, turbocharger, electrical equipment and number 2 cab. If required, each module could be easily removed from the underframe and replaced. The narrow body with cabs at either end led to them being given the nickname \"Bone\" by rail enthusiasts, but the design also made an American-style single cab version possible. ===Service=== The first locomotive, 58 001, was handed over to British Rail at Doncaster Works on 9 December 1982 and delivery of the remainder of the locomotives continued until early 1987 with the final delivery of 58 050. This loco was temporarily fitted with a SEPEX wheelslip control system, but upon completion experimental testing the equipment was removed before the locomotive entered traffic. SEPEX was central to the design of the Class 60. No export orders were received and so the jigs at Doncaster were dismantled and 58 050 became not only the last Class 58 to be built but the last diesel locomotive to be built at 'The Plant'. Since they were introduced in the early 1980s, the 58s saw service on a variety of freight duties. Despite claims made at the time, their performance was actually inferior to Class 56s on many types of freight train due to their increased tendency to wheelslip, largely as a result of bogie design. Although originally allocated to coal traffic, their arrival coincided with the miners' strike, and British Rail apparently only tolerated the construction of so many units because the components were already on order. As a result, the 58s could also be seen working other types of freight traffic. With the advent of privatisation in the 1990s, Class 58s greatly extended the geographical scope of their operations and were used on general freight traffic until withdrawal. In their day, Class 58s were powerful and capable freight locomotives, although not without their flaws. However, by the turn of the century they compared unfavourably with the new generation of locomotives and were quickly supplanted by Class 66s. In comparison, Class 58s were expensive to maintain and operate, and delivered much lower availability. ===Service in Continental Europe=== EWS announced in 2000 that eight Class 58s were to be moved to Spain (on hire to Spanish infrastructure operator GIF) and later, a large number of Class 58s (alongside Class 56s) operated in France for Fertis, TSO and Seco Rail. In May 2007, all of the locomotives from the French contract were returned to the UK and placed back into storage. The Spanish locomotives remain active however now under the ownership of Transfesa . The locomotives that were returned to the UK were sent back abroad to France from May\u2013October 2009 on hire to operators TSO and ETF. The Dutch locomotives were prepared for further use in France before being transported to France in July 2009. ===Accidents and incidents=== *On 6 August 1987, locomotive No. 58 013 was hauling a freight train that ran away and was derailed at Baddesley Ensor, Warwickshire. ===Withdrawal=== During the late 1990s, it was almost certain that the entire Class 58 fleet would see in the next millennium as working locomotives. However, despite being quoted as EWS's most reliable and consistent Type 5s, it was announced in 1999 that a large number of Class 58s were going to be placed into long-term storage: 58 017 was the first to be stored, quickly followed by 58 022. Since then, the remainder of the Class 58s were stored at various points around Britain. This was hastened by the introduction of 250 Class 66s. The last few Class 58 locomotives were withdrawn in September 2002 after working the last charter train, the \"Bone Idol\" from King's Cross to Skegness and return. Seven Class 58s were put on the DB Schenker April 2010 disposals list. This was the first time stored Class 58s had been put up for sale. One of these, 58 016, has entered preservation at Barrow Hill with the Class 58 Locomotive Group (C58LG). Five class 58s were listed for disposal by DB Schenker October 2015 disposals list, 58 008, 58 012, 58 022, 58 023, and 58 048. According to Railways Illustrated for August 2014: \"..the story of the 58s has been one of a shocking waste \u2013 they were nowhere near life-expired when withdrawn and to see them sitting in depots in France when there is a shortage of locos in the UK is baffling...\"Railways Illustrated, August 2014, page 94, ISSN 1479-2230 ===Disposal=== In January 2016 it was reported that DB Schenker had disposed of its last Class 58s in the UK. Of these 58 012, 58 022, 58 023, & 048 were saved for preservation but 58 008 was scrapped by Raxstar.Rail Magazine Issue 792, Page 29, 20 January 2016 ==Names and numbers== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Key: |In Service |bgcolor=#ffc0cb|Withdrawn/Stored (UK) |bgcolor=#f4a460|Withdrawn/Stored (Exported) |bgcolor=#87cefa|Preserved |bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped |} {| class=\"wikitable\" !Number!!Name!!Built!!UK Withdrawal!!Export!!Status!!Disposal |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 001|||| style=\"width: 100px;\" | 09 Dec 82|| 08 Oct 99|| style=\"width: 100px;\" | 13 Aug 09||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#cecece |58 002||Daw Mill Colliery, 17 Mar 88||9 May 83||09 Nov 00||||Scrapped||EMR Southampton, Jan 2014. |-bgcolor=#cecece |58 003||Markham Colliery, Jul 88||31 Jul 83||29 Nov 99||||Scrapped||EMR Kingsbury, Aug 2010. |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 004||||30 Sep 83||09 Jan 02||15 Oct 04||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 005||Ironbridge Power Station, 12 May 96||31 Oct 83||13 Oct 00||20 Jun 09||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 006||||31 Oct 83||11 Jan 00||24 Nov 09||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 007||Drakelow Power Station, 25 Aug 90||31 Nov 83||19 Jan 00||14 Oct 04||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#cecece |58 008||||31 Dec 83||29 Nov 99||||Scrapped||Raxstar at Eastleigh Works, in 2016. |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 009||||31 Jan 84||16 Jan 02||03 Nov 04||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 010||Audrey Newton, 12 Dec 87 (Worn for 1 day only)||29 Feb 84||08 Dec 99||23 Jun 04||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 011||Worksop Depot, 05 Sep 93||31 Mar 84||07 Dec 99||30 Jun 05||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#87cefa |58 012||||31 Mar 84||05 Dec 99||||Stored||Purchased for preservation, in 2016, from Ron Hull Jr's scrapyard and now stored at the Battlefield Line awaiting restoration. |-bgcolor=#f4a460 |58 013||||31 Mar 84||26 Apr 01||24 Jun 01||Stored (Alizay, France)|| |-bgcolor=#cecece |58 014||Didcot Power Station, 11 Jun 88||30 Apr 84||17 Nov 00||||Scrapped||EMR Kingsbury, Aug 2010. |-bgcolor=#cecece |58 015||||30 Sep 84||08 Oct 99||07 Oct 04||Scrapped||Montforte-del-Cid, Spain, c2019 |-bgcolor=#87cefa |58 016||||05 Oct 84||05 Aug 02||14 May 05||Under Restoration||Purchased for preservation on 28 Jun 10 by the C58LG and now undergoing restoration at Barrow Hill Roundhouse.

Shortly afterwards, on 7 July, the group announced they had also acquired another locomotive, 58045, as a spares donor. A subsequent posting on the group's website said that the stripping of 58045 had proceeded apace and all parts recovered were to be initially stored until the restoration of 58016 commences properly. In 2016 both 58012 and 58023 were both saved from Ron Hull Jr's scrapyard at Rotherham and are now at the Battlefield Line, privately owned in preservation. 58023 is now in running order, and there are also plans to restore 58012 to running order as well. 58048 is also owned by the Battlefield Line however it is planned that it will be saved for preservation to join the heritage roster at UK Rail Leasing Locomotives in Leicester where it will be on hire to Heritage Railways. 58022 was purchased by the Ivatt Diesel Recreation Society, with plans use it as the chassis in the new build class D16/1 LMS 10000. In 2002, 58050 was nominated by the Railway Heritage Committee for preservation at the conclusion of its service life.Railfreight 58 050 is saved for the National Collection Rail issue 432 3 April 2002 page 64 As of 2018 five members of the class have been preserved. === List of preserved locomotives === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=left|Number !align=left|Name !align=left|Livery !align=left|Status !align=left|Location !align=left|Notes |- |align=center|58012 |N/A |N/A |Stored |Battlefield Line |Purchased from Ron Hull Jr's scrapyard in 2016 and now stored awaiting restoration. |- |align=center|58016 |N/A |Fertis Grey |Under Restoration |Barrow Hill Roundhouse |Purchased for preservation in Oct 2010 to become the First member of class to be preserved. |- |align=center|58022 |N/A |N/A |Stored |Ecclesbourne Valley Railway |Purchased from Ron Hull Jr's scrapyard in 2016 and now stored awaiting deconstruction, with the frames destined for the new build class D16/1 LMS 10000.

The introduction of Railfreight sector liveries from October 1987 saw 58 050 outshopped by Stratford in the new triple grey scheme, complete with the Railfreight coal sub-sector logo. Eventually the majority of the fleet were repainted in triple grey livery. Upon shadow privatisation of the UK freight business, Mainline Freight became the owners of the 50 strong fleet, which saw a small number re-painted into the operator's aircraft blue and silver livery, while others had Mainline Freight branding applied to the triple grey bodywork. With full privatisation and the takeover of the freight operations by EWS, maroon and gold became the standard livery for repainted examples from mid-1997 and beyond. == Models == In 1979, prior to the building of the first locomotive by British Rail Engineering Limited, a 1:25 scale model was made by a member of the staff of the Locomotive Drawing Office at the Railway Technical Centre (RTC) in Derby, using the General Arrangement drawings of the proposed design. The model formed part of an exhibition at the RTC to illustrate the work of the Locomotive Design Office to the then Chairman of British Rail, Sir Peter Parker. In 1982 Hornby Railways released 00 gauge model of a Class 58, with variants produced over the next two decades. Heljan released an OO model in 2008. In 2011 Dapol released a model in N scale. == References == ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * == External links == *Class 58 Loco Group 58 Category:Co-Co locomotives Category:BREL locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1983 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Great Britain Category:Standard gauge locomotives of France Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Great Britain Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Spain Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of France Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Spain ",
