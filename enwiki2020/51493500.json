    "text": "The Reverend William Hackett SJ (2 May 1878 \u2013 9 July 1954) was an Irish priest, noted for his involvement in nationalist politics in Ireland, and in the educational and intellectual life of Melbourne as Rector of Xavier College and the founder of the Central Catholic Library. ==Biography== William Philip Hackett was born 2 May 1878, one of nine children of Kilkenny physician John Byrne Hackett and Bridget Doheney.Griffin 1983 Educated at Clongowes, Hackett entered the Society of Jesus in 1895,Griffin states 1896, while Niall says 1895 at p.31 being ordained priest in June 1912.Niall 2009, p.43 During his years teaching at Clongowes, Milltown Park and in Limerick, he got to know many figures involved in nationalist politics, such as Robert Barton and Erskine Childers, and appears to have provided them and others with some assistance following the Easter Rising in 1916 and during the Irish Civil War. Not long after the death of Michael Collins in 1922 he was posted to Australia, probably for his own safety.Niall 2009, ch.5 After a short stint teaching in Sydney, Hackett moved to Melbourne where he soon became the confidant of Archbishop Daniel Mannix. Appointed to the Richmond Parish, he also founded the Central Catholic Library in the city centre.Niall 2009, ch.9 The Library served a vital role in the intellectual life of Melbourne's Catholics, particularly in the development of the Campion Society and Catholic Action. Hackett served as Rector at Xavier College from 1935-1940, where his tenure was not uncontroversial due to clashes with alumni and his style of financial management.Niall 2009, ch.10 Following his removal from Xavier College, Hackett focused his energies on his true love - the Catholic Library, as well as trying to navigate the increasingly muddy waters of Australian Catholic politics in the lead up to the split of the Australian Labor Party.Griffin 1983 William Hackett died on 9 July 1954 as a result of injuries sustained when knocked down by a taxi.Niall 2009, p.269 ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Notes== ==References== * * ==Further reading== * * * * * * Category:1878 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Irish Jesuits Category:People educated at Clongowes Wood College ",
