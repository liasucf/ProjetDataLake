    "text": "OFC Russel Gab\u010d\u00edkovo was a Slovak football team, based in the town of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo. The club was founded in 1923. In February 2013, the club was renamed OFK Russel Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, due to the club's new sponsor. In 2016, the club was dissolved due to financial problems. ==History== If we take just football as the basis of organized sports, its origins date back over seventy-two years. However, if we seek the origins of folk games based on active movement, we have a very difficult time finding their first roots. How did it actually start with football? Easily: in green- and blue-white. It is explained very clearly by the book titled 70 Years of Sports in Gab\u010d\u00edkovo \u2013 1923\u20131993, according to which right after World War I French Legionnaires had been accommodated in the Castle Amade, who used to play football in the park of the castle. The bystander local youth liked this game very much. However, there was a problem: the villagers had no ball. Meanwhile, they learned that the French soldiers adored cat meat and, consequently, the population of cats became soon \u201cthinned\u201d in Gab\u010dikovo. The villagers sold male and female cats to Legionnaires and bought a real soccer ball. Let\u2019s suppose that indeed in 1923 football in Gab\u010dikovo started its \u201cjourney of conquest\u201d. However, in that case something is wrong, there is something contradictory in the memories of Imrich Vida and Michal Kov\u00e1cs: \u201cThe interest was great, and after all, we urged the youth to play, too!\u201d The idea of founding our own team came up immediately; however, some basic statutes would have been necessary for that, but we did not have available anything like that. Fortunately, the local Roman Catholic Reverend \u2013 priest Rezs\u0151 Bohus also supported us, even joined us... Concerning the previous quote, just two comments: Rezs\u0151 Bohus was appointed to the post of parish priest of the village of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo only in July 1929, so he could join the football team at the most in the summer of 1930! On the other hand, the basis Statute of BSK \u2013 i.e. the Sports Club of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo already existed in 1927! The football team of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo was in 1927 officially renamed as Gab\u010d\u00edkovsk\u00fd \u0160portov\u00fd Klub \u2013 BSK (BSK is the abbreviation of the Hungarian version of the club\u2019s title). BSK then played matches in green and white colors; players had a set of sports uniforms and two footballs. Franti\u0161ek Bartalos recorded the statutes of the club. Leadership positions were given to the former athlete from Budapest, \u013dudov\u00edt P\u00e9k and a local player, \u0160tefan Kom\u00e1romi. The backbone of the team was constituted by: Franti\u0161ek Pavlovics, Vojtech Bartal, Vojtech Kov\u00e1cs, Jozef Bartal, Jozef Pavlovics, Franti\u0161ek Vass, Jozef Horv\u00e1th, and Imrich Vida, just like Franti\u0161ek Sveiger, Rezs\u0151 Koczk\u00e1s, Ladislav Bod\u00f3, Eugen Bod\u00f3 and \u0160tefan Horv\u00e1th. The team of this club even won a Winning Cup in 1928 against other teams from the surrounding villages. During the years 1938\u20131945 Gab\u010d\u00edkovo was again attached to Hungary, and the football players of the Sports Club of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo had been included into the County Youth League of Gy\u0151r* in the context of football championships (*this included youth, who, depending on their age were classified into the organization for compulsory pre-military training of youth that existed in the years from 1921 to 1944 only in the former Hungary \u2013 comment of the translator). Arp\u00e1d Knap and Michal Viola, who were coaches, prepared the following athletes from Gab\u010d\u00edkovo for football: Ladislav M\u00f3zes, Franti\u0161ek Sveiger, Eugen Both, Ign\u00e1c Jakus, Tibor Cs\u00f6rg\u0151, Michal Varga, J\u00falius Nagy, Ladislav Derzsi, Imrich Both, J\u00e1n Gr\u00f3f, \u013dudov\u00edt T\u00f3th, \u013dudov\u00edt R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Eugen Raj and Franti\u0161ek Raj \u2013 who actually formed the framework of the football team. After World War II, in 1947, properly organized football \"kicked off\". At its \u201ccradle\u201d stood Arp\u00e1d Gr\u00f3f, Aurel Heizer, Eugen Both, J\u00e1n Gr\u00f3f, Alfred Bellus, Arp\u00e1d Nagy and others who have contributed to the football playing of the team of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo by their help \u2013 at the district championship organized in Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda. For a long time, the footballers of \u010calovo (today Ve\u013ek\u00fd Meder \u2013 comment of the translator) and Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda have undermined the possibility of footballers from Gab\u010d\u00edkovo stepping higher. Finally in 1958 Gab\u010d\u00edkovo won the championship in the district and stepped forward to the regional championship, where the footballers of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo had remained until 1961. It was in that year when the team fell back to the level of district championships in which the team of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo played football matches between the years of 1961 and 1968 under the name of \u201cDru\u017estevn\u00edk\u201d (\u201cCooperator\u201d), despite the fact that this their \u201cgodfather\u201d was unable to support them... In 1968, the creation of the team of an \"innovative spirit\u201d began. From the framework, which was constituted by: Ivan Frivalszky, Peter Frivalszky, \u0160tefan Varga, Matej Derzsi, \u0160tefan Both, Alfred Csiba, Imrich Csiba, Vojtech G\u00fagh, Ivan Palkovics, Flori\u00e1n Kozm\u00e9r, Ladislav Patasi, Ondrej R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, Jozef Nagy, \u0160tefan M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Bod\u00f3, Alfred Szab\u00f3, Ga\u0161par Derzsi, J\u00e1n Ondr\u00e1\u0161ek (four-time Czechoslovak national team), Peter Derzsi, Pavol Derzsi, Ladislav Sid\u00f3, \u013dudov\u00edt M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and Franti\u0161ek Heiszer \u2013 coach Franti\u0161ek Kuczmann prepared such a squad, which in 1976 won the title of district champion! Gab\u010d\u00edkovo moved to the county I. B league. In 1978 the team was reorganized again. The squad consisted of the following players: A. Luk\u00e1cs, L. Nagy, Magyarics, Gy. Horv\u00e1th, Seb\u0151, Patasi, Sipos, Gaura, Hal\u00e1sz, Balogh, and \u017diak, and was led by coach Alexander Br\u00e1nyik into district class A. In the context of the football cup, this squad even \u201cfought itself\u201d into the circle of the sixteen best club teams in Slovakia. Within the framework of championships, in the years 1979\u20131980 Gab\u010d\u00edkovo \u201cended\u201d at 13th place; however, already in the season after \u2013 to the delight of its fans \u2013 it got up on the podium. The bronze group consisted at the time of its new coach, Bertalan Sipos and the following players: M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Botl\u00f3, Farkas, Fodor, Izsm\u00e1n, L\u00e9pes, Derzsi, Seb\u0151, Malinovszky, On\u00f3dy, Cs\u00e1n\u00f3, \u0160kabla, \u0160tropka, Di\u00f3szegi, Nagy, and G\u00e1bri\u0161. Subsequently, first this football team from Gab\u010d\u00edkovo ranked itself at 4th place, and in the championship of 1982\u201383 it ranked itself at 5th place; however, under a new name, the \u201cTelov\u00fdchovn\u00e1 Jednota \u0160t\u00e1tneho Majetku Gab\u010d\u00edkovo\u201d (\u201cPhysical Education Union of the State Property of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo\u201d), i.e. TJ SM Gab\u010d\u00edkovo. In the meantime, the national economy started to sponsor this club with its \u201cprotective wings\u201d, and the club started to succeed increasingly under the leadership of its director, coming from Baky. In the ranks of the team some changes were made and thus in 1989 it won the championship in class I. A. Two years later the team got into the so- called \u201cwestern\u201d team of class II of the Slovak National League. In 1991 the team remained in its class, although \u201con shaky legs\u201d, but in 1993 it strengthened itself again and won another championship! Members of the championship team were: Sergei Prikhodko and Attila Jankovics \u2013 goalkeepers, defenders were: Barnab\u00e1\u0161 Kov\u00e1ts, Franti\u0161ek T\u00f3th (team captain), Jozef Medgyes, Franti\u0161ek Csiff\u00e1ri, Dezider Varga, Milan \u0160koda and Genadij Salov; deep-lying playmakers were: Tiham\u00e9r Varga, Jozef Ravasz, Tibor Domonkos, Zolt\u00e1n M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Peter Moln\u00e1r and Ferdinand Szab\u00f3; and the forwards were: Zsolt Gy\u0151ri, Tibor Szab\u00f3 and Gabriel Johancsik who attacked the opponents' goal. The education of adolescents means continuous renewal and refreshment of football in Gab\u010d\u00edkovo. The young football players have been systematically dealt with since 1948. In 1976 the youth football team of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo achieved the title District Champion, and afterwards, in 1977 it achieved the title of a Champion in class I.B and it got to the class I.A, where the team of players, consisting of the following players: Darnay, Izsm\u00e1n, \u00c1. M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, Jandura, Szeif, Both, Katona, Vida, R. Nagy, R. M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, K\u00e1ntor and V\u00f6r\u00f6s was led by the following coaches: Alfr\u00e9d Fekete and \u017digmund V\u00e9gh with the relevant knowledge and experience. In 1993 the club celebrated its 70th anniversary \u2013 thanks to the sponsorship of the state property of Gab\u010d\u00edkovo \u2013 not only with the championship team of seniors but also with that of the youth! The goal difference they achieved could be recorded into the book of records: 136:23! The framework of the junior championship team consisted of the following players: Arnold Schweiger and Tibor Csonka \u2013 goalkeepers, Robert Szek\u00e1cs, Matej Jakus, Robert Oll\u00e9, Arp\u00e1d M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and Ladislav Derzsi \u2013 defenders, Imrich Gr\u00f3f, Kornel Csicsay, Imrich Hars\u00e1nyi, Adrian Zs\u00e1kovics, Koloman Strbka and \u0160tefan Kov\u00e1cs \u2013 midfield players, and Norbert Both, Imrich Pusk\u00e1s, Szil\u00e1rd Fekete, Ladislav Fenes and Marian Cs\u00f6lle \u2013 forwards.
