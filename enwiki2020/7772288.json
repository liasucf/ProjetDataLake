He was an administrator with the Southeastern Conference in the 1970s and later served as an athletic director at Florida State University (1981-89) and Alabama (1989-95). ==Early years== A native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Ingram is the son of Wayne and Ella Ingram. He attended Tuscaloosa High School, where he received four varsity letters in basketball and three each in football and baseball.

As a sophomore in 1952, Ingram was selected as an All-SEC defensive back. In December 1952, the United Press International ran a feature story on Ingram calling him the \"Tide's Honorable Thief,\" due to his talent for intercepting passes. The story gave warning to Alabama's Orange Bowl opponent, \"Pre-Orange Bowl warning to Syracuse: beware of Cecil Ingram, an honorable thief. The slender Alabama sophomore safetyman stole more passes thrown by opponents than any other man in the Southeastern Conference this year.\" His ten interceptions for 162 yards in 1952 (including two returned for touchdowns) tied the Southeastern Conference record for interceptions in a season. He added an eleventh interception in the 1953 Orange Bowl game on January 1, 1953, as Alabama crushed Syracuse 61-6. He also set an Alabama Orange Bowl record with an 80-yard punt return in the 1953 Orange Bowl.
