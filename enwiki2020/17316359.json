    "text": "Frederick Louis Roehrig (1857 - 1948) was an early 20th-century American architect. Roehrig was born in LeRoy, New York, the son of the noted \"orientalist and philoligist,\" Frederick L.O. Roehrig He graduated from Cornell University in 1883 and also studied architecture in England and France. His architectural styles evolved over time, covering the Victorian, American Craftsman, and Neo-Classical styles. Roehrig is particularly known for his many landmark buildings in Pasadena, California, including the Hotel Green, and Pasadena Heritage has occasionally conducted tours of Roehrig's buildings. ==Notable works== Roehrig's notable works include the following: *Hotel Green -- The landmark Hotel Green, located at 99 South Raymond Avenue in Pasadena, was built in the late 19th century and helped build Roehrig's reputation. The Hotel Green was home to both the Tournament of Roses and the Valley Hunt Club. It was built by George Gill Green and was supplemented by two later buildings, including Castle Green. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ** Castle Green -- Another of Roehrig's landmark structures is Castle Green, built in 1898 as an annex to the Hotel Green. In 2003, the Los Angeles Times described Roehrig's concept for Castle Green as follows: \"And there is Castle Green, which is not really a castle either, but a fantastic folly created from the imagination of a Victorian architect with a penchant for Arabesque opulence. ... The imposing Moorish- style structure is redolent with atmosphere, from its cylindrical turrets to its ornate cornices. You have to stop and remind yourself that this is no longer a grand turn-of-the-century hotel, but condominiums.\" Hotel Green *Frederick Hastings Rindge House -- In 1902, Roehrig designed a 25-room mansion for Frederick H. Rindge (the owner of Malibu, California) in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Rindge House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. * Ramsay-Durfee Estate -- The Ramsay-Durfee Estate is a 42-room, Tudor mansion with a Craftsman interior, designed by Roehrig and built in 1908.
