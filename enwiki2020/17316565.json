The ceremony was held at the \"Moulin Rouge Nightclub\" in Hollywood, California. The ceremony, hosted by Steve Allen and broadcast on NBC, was the first Emmy Awards ceremony to be televised nationally. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses. New categories for this ceremony included awards for writing and directing, as well as one-time performances in anthology series, (this category would eventually morph into the current guest-acting category). Studio One was the most successful show of the night, winning three awards. Fredric March made Emmy history when he became the first actor to be nominated for two different works in the same category. However, he lost for both of his performances in the category of Best Actor in a Single Performance. ==Winners and nominees== Emmys.com list of 1955 Nominees & Winners ===Programs=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |- ! width=\"50%\"| Best Situation Comedy ! width=\"50%\"| Best Dramatic Program |- | valign=\"top\" | * Make Room for Daddy, (ABC) ** The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, (CBS) ** I Love Lucy, (CBS) ** Mr. Peepers, (NBC) ** Our Miss Brooks, (CBS) ** Private Secretary, (CBS) | valign=\"top\" | *The United States Steel Hour, (ABC) ** Four Star Playhouse, (CBS) ** Medic, (NBC) ** The Philco Television Playhouse, (NBC) ** Studio One, (CBS) |- ! width=\"50%\" | Best Variety Series including Musical Varieties ! width=\"50%\" | Best Audience, Guest Participation, or Panel Program |- | valign=\"top\" | * Disneyland, (ABC) ** The Ed Sullivan Show, (CBS) ** The George Gobel Show, (NBC) ** The Jack Benny Program, (CBS) ** The Jackie Gleason Show, (CBS) ** Your Show of Shows, (NBC) | valign=\"top\" | *This Is Your Life, (NBC) ** Masquerade Party, (ABC) ** People Are Funny, (NBC) ** What's My Line?, (CBS) ** You Bet Your Life, (CBS) |- ! width=\"50%\"| Best Mystery or Intrigue Series ! width=\"50%\"| Best Children's Program |- | valign=\"top\" | *Dragnet, (NBC) ** Foreign Intrigue, (NBC) ** I Led Three Lives, (NBC) ** Racket Squad, (CBS) ** Waterfront, (Syndication) | valign=\"top\" | *Lassie, (CBS) **Art Linkletter and the Kids, (Syndication) ** Ding Dong School, (NBC) ** Kukla, Fran and Ollie, (ABC) ** Time for Beany, (PTN) ** Zoo Parade, (NBC) |- ! width=\"50%\"| Best Cultural, Religious, or Educational Program ! width=\"50%\"| Best Sports Program |- | valign=\"top\" | *Omnibus, (CBS) **Life is Worth Living, (DuMont) **See It Now, (CBS) **Meet the Press, (NBC) | valign=\"top\" | *Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, (NBC) **Greatest Moments in Sports, (NBC) **Forrest Hills Tennis Matches, (NBC) **NCAA Football Games, (ABC) **Pabst Blue Ribbion Bouts, (CBS) **Professional Football, (DuMont) |- ! width=\"50%\" | Best Western or Adventure Series ! width=\"50%\" | Best Daytime Program |- | valign=\"top\" | *Stories of the Century, (Syndication) ** The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (Syndication) ** Annie Oakley (Syndication) ** Death Valley Days (CBS) ** The Roy Rogers Show (NBC) | valign=\"top\" | * House Party, (CBS) ** The Betty White Show, (NBC) ** The Bob Crosby Show, (CBS) ** The Garry Moore Show, (CBS) ** The Robert Q.
