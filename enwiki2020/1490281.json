    "text": "An Ideal for Living is the first EP by the English post-punk band Joy Division. It was released in 1978 by the band's own label, Enigma, shortly after the group changed its name from Warsaw. == Recording == All tracks were recorded at Pennine Sound Studios in Oldham on 14 December 1977. The recording sessions were self-financed by the band, on a budget of \u00a3400. == Content == The release reflects the band's early punk influences, as opposed to the post- punk style they later developed. === Record cover === The cover has a black- and-white picture of a blond Hitler Youth member beating a drum, which was drawn by guitarist Bernard Sumner (called \"Bernard Albrecht\" on the poster sleeve) and the words \"Joy! Division\" printed in a blackletter font. The cover design, coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled controversy over whether the band had Nazi sympathies. When the EP was re-released on 12-inch vinyl, the original cover was replaced by artwork featuring scaffolding. == Release == A 7\" version of An Ideal for Living was released in June on the band's own Enigma label, which was sold out by September and was subsequently followed by a 12\" version on 10 October on the band's own Anonymous Records label. All four tracks were re-released on the 1988 singles compilation, Substance. A remastered version of the EP was reissued by Rhino Entertainment to coincide with Record Store Day 2014. == Legacy == The EP subsequently inspired the Manic Street Preachers' single \"A Design For Life\".Britpop and the English Music Tradition p. 146 == Critical reception == In a retrospective review, David Cleary of AllMusic wrote that \"[the] sound quality and production values on this release are extremely primitive\", while describing the release as \"a mildly interesting, if not great EP\". He also noted that with the re-release of \"Warsaw\" and \"Leaders of Men\" on the rarities album Substance (the other two were originally only included on CD and cassette versions of the album), the need for diehard Joy Division fans to obtain this EP had notably decreased. == Track listing == All songs written by Joy Division. # \"Warsaw\" \u2013 2:26 # \"No Love Lost\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Leaders of Men\" \u2013 2:34 # \"Failures\" \u2013 3:44 == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Vinyl ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- | 7\" | 3 June 1978 | Enigma Records |- | 12\" | 10 October 1978 | Anonymous Records |} == References == == External links == * Category:Joy Division EPs Category:1978 debut EPs Category:Enigma Records EPs Category:Obscenity controversies in music ",
