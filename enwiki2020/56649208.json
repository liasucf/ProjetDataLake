Awasr started operations in March 2015. It is a wholly owned Omani telecommunications company operating as per the guidelines set in Oman\u2019s National Broadband Strategy. Awasr received a Class I license in 2012 valid for 25 years from the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) for provision of Fixed public telecommunications services in Muscat Governorate, subsequently extended to cover all of Oman. == History == Launched in March 2015, Awasr is the country\u2019s first purely fibre-optic network for home and business internet connections. Headquartered in the capital, Muscat, Awasr has grown in strength and size since it first acquired the Class 1 License to provide general fixed telephone services across the Sultanate of Oman. Over 2017, Awasr, which is the first provider to launch 1Gbit/s speed consumer product in the market, fortified its domestic presence by bringing newer destinations under its coverage, complementing Oman\u2019s National Broadband Strategy. The strategy is aimed at enhancing Oman\u2019s fixed network penetration, which is below the regional average. Its objectives are to ensure that every resident in the country has access to high-speed broadband at affordable prices and to bring rural and remote communities under broadband connectivity. Awasr\u2019s staggered growth is commensurate with these crucial requisites. The Oman National Investment Development Company (TANMIA) has 32% stake in Awasr. TANMIA invests in Awasr through a combination of equity purchase from the current owners and a capital increase to finance new development projects. == Mission == Connecting and enriching lives through innovative experiences. == Vision == To provide the best customer experience in the markets we serve. == Top Management == Board of Directors The members of Awasr\u2019s board of directors are as follows: * HH Sayyid Mohammed Asaad Tarik Al Said * HH Sayyid Muhanna Asaad Tarik Al Said Chairman * HH Sayyid Asaad Tariq Taimur Al Said Deputy Chairman: * HH Sayyid Taimur Asaad Tariq Al Said Chief Operating Officer: * Abdulmonem Mohammed Al Futaisi == Awasr Coverage Area == * Al-Ghubra * Al-Hail * Al-Hamriyya * Al-Khoudh * Al-Mabaila North * Al-Mabaila South * Al-Manuma * Al Mawalih * Al Qurum * Al Athaiba * Al Wadi Al Kabir * Al Wutayyah * Darsait * Madinat Al Ilam * Ruwi * Wadi Adai * Al Amerat * Al Khuwair * Musannah * Salalah *Airport Heights *Mina Al Fahal *Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos *Hilat Al Sadd *Shatti Al Qurum *Wadi Adai == Existing products == Fibrenet Home: * Fibrenet Basic 20 Mbps * Fibrenet Plus 50 Mbps * Fibrenet Ultra 150 Mbps * Fibrenet Giga 1000 Mbps Fibrenet Business * Lite 10 Mbps * Essential 20 Mbps * Plus 50 Mbps * Premium 140 Mbps * Ultra 250 Mbps Add-Ons * Jawwy TV * Double Your speed (DYS) * SafeNet ==References== * Category:Internet service providers of Oman Category:2016 establishments in Oman www.awasr.om ",
