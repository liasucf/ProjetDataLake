    "text": "Take Them On, On Your Own is the second studio album by American rock band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. It was first released in the UK on August 25, 2003, and in the US on September 2, 2003. The album was reissued with bonus tracks in 2008. The album cover is a homage to the film The Third Man. The album has a darker, harder rock sound than their debut album, and also contains more politically themed lyrics. The album reached #3 in the United Kingdom music charts despite receiving mixed reviews, and is almost universally credited as a lesser achievement than its predecessor B.R.M.C.. The 2003 release of this album contained the Copy Control protection system in some regions. The 2008 Japanese and European CD reissue contains three bonus tracks: \"Take Them On, On Your Own\", \"High / Low\", and \"Waiting Here\". ==Track listing== ;Japanese 2008 Bonus tracks # * Take Them On, On Your Own\" - 5:27 # \"High / Low\" - 4:03 # \"Waiting Here\" - 3:49 ==Credits== * Bass, Guitar, Vocals \u2013 Robert Turner * Drums, Percussion \u2013 Nick Jago * Guitar, Bass, Vocals \u2013 Peter Hayes * Lyrics by \u2013 Peter Hayes, Robert Turner * Music by \u2013 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club * Engineer \u2013 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Ric Simpson * Engineering Assistant \u2013 Ben Thackeray * Mastered by \u2013 Mike Lazer * Mastered by [per etching] \u2013 Paul Stubblebine * Mixed by \u2013 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Ken Andrews (tracks: 1 to 4, 6, 8, 10 to 13) * Mixed by (assistant)\u2013 Justin Smith (tracks: 1 to 4, 6, 8, 10 to 13) * Producer \u2013 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club * (additional) Recording by \u2013 Ken Andrews ===Notes=== *Recorded at Mayfair Studios (in Primrose Hill), B.R.M.C.
