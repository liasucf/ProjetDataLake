The team continued their regular season dominance by winning an Overwatch League record 19 consecutive games that was not snapped until on June 23, when the Los Angeles Valiant defeated the Titans. While they qualified for the Stage 3 playoffs, Vancouver was defeated by the Shanghai Dragons in the semifinals round. The Titans lost two more times in the regular season, against the Washington Justice and Shock, to end the regular season with a league-best 25\u20133 record and the top seed in the season playoffs. Vancouver started their playoff run by defeating Seoul Dynasty 4\u20132 in the first round to advance to the first round of the winners bracket. In that round, the Titans defeated the Los Angeles Gladiators 4\u20132. The win sent the team to the winners bracket final, where they took down the New York Excelsior 4\u20133 to advance to the Grand Finals, where they faced the San Francisco Shock. The Titans were swept 0\u20134 by the Shock. == Preceding offseason == On December 1, Titans also announced that it had signed nine players to the team, including all eight members of the Korean Contenders Champions RunAway, and Hwang \"paJion\" Ji-Sub as the team's head coach. The signed players were: *Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong, *Lee \"Hooreg\" Dong-eun, *Seo \"SeoMinSoo\" Min-soo, *Lee \"Stitch\" Chung-lee, *Park \"Bumper\" Sang-beom, *Choi \"JJANU\" Hyun-woo, *Lee \"Twilight\" Ju-seok, *Kim \"RAPEL\" Jun-keun, and *Kim \"SLIME\" Seong-jun. == Regular season == === Stage 1 === Vancouver began their 2019 season on February 16 with a 4\u20130 sweep over Shanghai Dragons.

The Stage 1 Finals took place on March 24 with the Titans taking on the sixth-seeded San Francisco Shock. The match opened on Nepal. The Shock were able to punish Vancouver main tank Park \"Bumper\" Sang-beom's aggressive play style throughout the map; tide-turning Earthshatters from Shock's Matthew \"super\" DeLisi on Reinhardt pushed the Shock to claim the first map of the series. For the second map, the match went to Nepal. Contrasted to the first map, it was Vancouver's Bumper on Reinhardt executing well-timed Earthshatters, leading to the Shock being full-held and losing the map. The Shock chose Temple of Anubis for map three; the map went to overtime rounds after both teams completed the map, but the Shock once again completed the map and prevented the Titans from doing the same.

The Shock won the first round, the Titans evened up the map by winning the second, and the Shock took the third round. The Titans selected King's Row for map seven, and they were able to complete the map on their attack led by stellar play from SeoMinSoo on Zarya. Despite clutch plays from Grant \"Moth\" Espe on L\u00facio, the Shock could not capture all three points on their attack. The loss tied the series up 3\u20133 as the match went to a finals seventh map. For the final map, the Shock selected Rialto. San Francisco completed the map with a solid time-bank remaining, but Vancouver responded by completing the map with the fastest time recorded ever in the Overwatch League.

Shanghai came out of the break on fire, taking a close win on Volskaya Industries, putting up a dominant defensive performance on Havana, and closing out the series on Oasis. The DPS-heavy compositions ran by the Dragons proved to be too much to handle, as Vancouver fell 1\u20134. === Stage 4 === For their first match of Stage 4, which would include the implementation of an enforced 2-2-2 role lock by the league, the Titans faced the Dragons in a rematch of the Stage 3 Semifinals; Vancouver took their revenge and won the match 3\u20131.

New York sent the match to King's Row next; the Excelsior struck back in map two, completing the map on their attack and holding Vancouver from completing the same feat, due in part to a stellar performance by New York's DPS Kim \"Libero\" Hye-sung on Doomfist.

The Shock came out strong and took the first point of the round. In round two, the Titans came out on top of the first team fight and took first control. The two teams traded point captures in round two, but a strong performance by Shock Jay \"sinatraa\" Won on Doomfist sealed a map win for the Shock in the second round. The Titans playing in the Grand Finals. Vancouver selected Eichenwalde for map two. San Francisco attacked first and were able to capture the first point on their first attempt. As the map moved to the escort potion, the Shock did not lose a team fight as they captured the second point with over four minutes in the time bank. As the payload was escorted though the final phase of the map, Rascal used Mei's ice walls helping to both protect and elevate Architect's Bastion to give him high ground. Notably, Architect had managed to get Bastion up onto one of the chandeliers that hung near the end of the map and, subsequently, prevented the Titans from challenging the final capture from this tactical position. The Shock finished the map with 2:49 in the time bank. For their defense, the Shock opted to defend with Rascal on Pharah, while Architect remained on Bastion. The Titans responded well, and through a lengthy team fight, they were able to capture the first point and began escorting the payload. After Vancouver reached the second checkpoint, the Shock were able to stop the Titans in the first fight of the third phase, but the Titans came back in full force and finished the map with 2:47 in their time bank. As both teams completed the map, the map went to overtime rounds; Vancouver attacked first, but they were only able to capture about half of the first point. On San Francisco's attack, they were held up under the choke point for an extended amount of time, but the team was able to touch the capture area as time ran out to force an overtime timer; a clutch ultimate from Choi \"ChoiHyoBin\" Hyo-bin on Sigma led to the Shock closing out the map with a win. Coming out of halftime, the Titan's chose assault map Temple of Anubis for the match's third map; the Shock brought sinatraa and Striker back in for Rascal and Architect. The Titans attacked first and were able to capture the first point on their first attempt. After a few failed attempts, the Titans finally broke through the Shock's second point defenses and, after a lengthy stagger delay from the Shock, finished the map with 1:34 remaining. On defense, the Titans focused on shutting down sinatraa's Doomfist, and found some success, as they were able to hold of the Shock's first and second attacks. However, the Shock finally broke through the Titan defense as the timer ran out and captured the first point in overtime. San Francisco carried that momentum into the second point and won the first team fight to finish the map with 2:12 in their time bank. The Titans had the first attack in overtime rounds; after getting shut down multiple times, Haksal's Doomfist created an opening for the Titans to take the first point with less than 15 seconds remaining. With only time for one more attack, the Titan's failed to capture the second point. The Shock responded on their attack by taking the first point on their first attempt. Striker found an early pick as the Shock attacked the second point, but Vancouver was able to recover and held back the Shock. San Francisco responded by taking down Vancouver in the next team fight and took their third map win. With the Shock at match point, the Titans selected Watchpoint: Gibraltar for map four. Defending first, Vancouver overcame the Bastion/Mei composition run by San Francisco in the first team fight right at the beginning of the map; however, the Shock eventually broke through the Titan defense and went on to complete the map with 1:52 remaining. Vancouver struggled to push the payload to the first checkpoint on their attack, largely due to a stellar performance by Shock's DPS Rascal on Pharah. The Titans eventually broke through and pushed the payload past the second checkpoint. However, Vancouver could not find a footing in the final phase of the map. With Architect as Bastion on the high ground defending the final checkpoint of the map, the Shock held the Titans from completing the map and claimed a 4\u20130 sweep, ending the Titan's season in second place. == Final roster == === Transactions === Transactions of/for players on the roster during the 2019 regular season: *On August 16, the Titans signed Hwang \"TiZi\" Jang-hyeon. == Standings == === Record by stage === {| class=\"toccolours\" border=0 cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size:95%; text- align:left; width:700px;\" |- align=\"left\" style=\"background:#; color:#;\" ! style=\"width:75px\" | Stage !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! |- |colspan = \"10\" | |- |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 1 | 7 | 7 | 0 | | 24 | 6 | 0 | +18 | 1 |-style=\"background:#cfc | 2 | 7 | 7 | 0 | | 25 | 3 | 0 | +22 | 2 |-style=\"background:#cfc | 3 | 7 | 6 | 1 | | 21 | 7 | 0 | +14 | 2 |- | 4 | 7 | 5 | 2 | | 19 | 12 | 0 | +7 | 5 |-style=\"background-color:#cfc;\" !
