It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,4,3,3,3}, it has three 24-cell honeycombs around each cell. It is dual to the 5-orthoplex honeycomb. == Related honeycombs== It is related to the regular Euclidean 4-space 24-cell honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, and the hyperbolic 5-space order-4 24-cell honeycomb honeycomb. == See also == * List of regular polytopes == References == *Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, 3rd. ed., Dover Publications, 1973. .
