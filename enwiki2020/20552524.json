    "text": "The micro-pulling-down (\u03bc-PD) method is a crystal growth technique based on continuous transport of the melted substance through micro-channel(s) made in a crucible bottom. Continuous solidification of the melt is progressed on a liquid/solid interface positioned under the crucible. In a steady state, both the melt and the crystal are pulled-down with a constant (but generally different) velocity. Many different types of crystal are grown by this technique, including Y3Al5O12, Si, Si-Ge, LiNbO3, \u03b1-Al2O3, Y2O3, Sc2O3, LiF, CaF2, BaF2, etc. ==Crystal growth routine== Standard routine procedure used in the growth of most of \u03bc-PD crystals is well developed. The general stages of the growths include: * Charging of the crucible with starting materials (mixture of powders) * Heating of the crucible until starting materials in the crucible are completely melted * Upward displacement of the seed until its contact with the meniscus or crucible * Formation of the meniscus and partial melting of the seed top * Correction of the shape of the meniscus through appropriate adjustment of crucible temperature and position of the seed crystal * Crystal growth through pulling of the seed in downward direction * Separation of the as grown crystal from the meniscus * Cooling of the system (including the crystal and the crucible) to room temperature ==See also== *Crystal growth *Czochralski process *Float-zone silicon *Flux method *Laser- heated pedestal growth *Shaping processes in crystal growth *Verneuil process *Lithium niobate *Sapphire *Scandium(III) oxide *Yttrium aluminium garnet ==References== Category:Chemical processes Category:Industrial processes Category:Semiconductor growth Category:Crystals ",
