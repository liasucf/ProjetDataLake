In 1979, she entered the dubbing field as a voice actress, first in the Peter Falk movie The In-Laws (dubbing Nancy Dussault), and then as minor characters in Fame. In 1983, Vivares joined Barrio S\u00e9samo as principal puppeteer, performing the full-bodied Espinete, the most identifiable Muppet on the series. Her work as Espinete kept her pre- occupied, but when Barrio S\u00e9samo was cancelled in 1987, Vivares went back behind the microphone, dubbing Penelope Sudrow in the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 3. She also reprised Espinete in a theatre version of Barrio S\u00e9samo during the late 1980s, touring through Spain alongside other actors from the series such as S\u00e1nchez and Jos\u00e9 Riesgo. On-camera, Vivares played a dressmaker in the final episode of the Spanish series Farmacia de guardia (1995).She made multiple guest appearances on the TV crime drama El Comisario, notably as the distraught mother of a kidnapped child. Voice acting Vivares became more prolific as a voice actress, most often dubbing child roles or young male actors, such as the character Tommy in The Punisher (with Dolph Lundgren) and Peter Brady on The Brady Bunch. Her most substantial work was on The Simpsons as Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, Martin Prince, Itchy, and others. Other animation dub credits include Bucky the squirrel in Disney's The Emperor's New Groove, Amy Wong on Futurama, Mandark on Dexter's Laboratory, Tails on Sonic the Hedgehog, Stan Marsh on South Park, and Sailor Neptune on Sailor Moon.

(1998, Maite Ruiz de Austri) as Nicky, the little mouse (with fellow Barrio S\u00e9samo puppeteer Emma Cohen as the mother mouse). She also voiced the principal character of \"la se\u00f1orita Ofelia\" in multiple computer games adapting the Spanish comic- book Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n. Vivares continues to work primarily as a voice actress, however, dubbing the characters of Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter movies, Chloe on Smallville, and parts on Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Charmed.
