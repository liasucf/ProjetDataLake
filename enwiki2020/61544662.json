    "text": "A map showing the location of Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters. In Scotland, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are areas of sea defined so as to protect to habitats, wildlife, geology, undersea landforms, historic shipwrecks, and to demonstrate sustainable management of the sea. As of December 2018, approximately 22% of Scotland's seas were covered by the Scottish MPA network. ==Designation== The Loch Carron MPA is the site of the world's largest flame shell bed. As of December Scotland's MPA network comprises 231 sites protected by a variety of different conservation designations, many of which are the same as those used on land, such as Special Protection Areas (SPA) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The legal framework differs depending on the designation: for example SSSIs are designated under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. Where not designated under other conservation legislation MPAs are designated under one of two acts of parliament, depending on their location: *The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 is an act of the Scottish Parliament which gives the Scottish Government the power to designate MPAs in Scottish Territorial Waters (waters 12 up to nautical miles of the coastline). *The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 is an act of the UK Parliament which gives the Scottish Government the power to designate MPAs in Scottish Offshore Waters (waters lying further from the coast than 12 nm, and defined as Scottish by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999).Scottish MPA network - Parliamentary Report. p. 5. Sites are designated as MPAs under these acts for one of three purposes: *Nature Conservation MPAs are defined to protect biodiversity *Historical MPAs are used to protect sites such as marine wrecks and artefacts *One Demonstration and Research MPA has been defined to test novel approaches to marine management In addition to the statutory MPAs, five sites are recognised as forming part of the Scottish MPA network, being categorised as \"other area based measures\": such areas, although not specifically created for nature conservation purposes, are considered to contribute to the protection of marine biodiversity. The makeup of the current network is detailed in the table below:Scottish MPA network - Parliamentary Report. p. 11.Scottish MPA network - Parliamentary Report. p. 32. {| | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

For nature conservation sites within territorial waters NatureScot is responsible for developing the network and providing scientific advice to Scottish Government on the selection of sites, and providing advice to Marine Scotland on management once sites are designated. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee fulfils this role for sites in offshore waters, and also has a coordinating role for nature conservation in all the UK's offshore waters. Historic Environment Scotland is responsible for historic MPAs. Activities undertaken in an MPA can be managed through voluntary measures, or by implementation of Marine Conservation Orders or Inshore Fishing Orders. Management measures (such as restrictions on the type of fishing gear that can be used) may be in place for all or part of an MPA, and may only apply at certain times of year. Environmental groups have criticised the government for failing to enforce fishing rules around MPAs. ==List of MPAs== These tables list those MPAs not covered by other designations (i.e. excluding SACs, SPAs, and SSSIs etc.) as of August 2019. ===Historic MPAs=== {| | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name !Size (ha) !Date !Type !Advisory body |- ||HMS Campania||7.1 ||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- ||HMS Dartmouth||0.8 ||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- ||Drumbeg||7.1|| 18 March 2013||Historic||HES |- ||Duart Point||1.8 ||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- ||Iona I||2.5||26 October 2016||Historic||HES |- ||Kinlochbervie||28.3||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- |Mingary||19.6url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/document/600000732||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- ||Out Skerries||22.8||1 November 2013||Historic||HES |- |} | |} ===Nature Conservation MPAs=== {| | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name !Size (km2) !Date !Type !Advisory body |- ||Central Fladen||925||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Clyde Sea Sill||712||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || NatureScot |- ||East Caithness Cliffs||114||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|| NatureScot |- ||East of Gannet and Montrose Fields||1839||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|| JNCC |- ||Faroe\u2013Shetland Sponge Belt||5278||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Fetlar to Haroldswick||216||18 November 2016||Nature Conservation || NatureScot |- ||Firth of Forth Banks Complex||2130||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Geikie Slide and Hebridean Slope||2215||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Hatton-Rockall Basin||1256||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|| JNCC |- ||Loch Carron||23||19 May 2019||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Loch Creran||12||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Loch Sunart||49||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|NatureScot |- ||Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura||741||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation ||NatureScot |- ||Loch Sween||41||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Lochs Duich, Long and Alsh||37||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Monach Isles||62||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Mousa to Boddam||13||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||North-east Faroe\u2013Shetland Channel||23682||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation ||JNCC |- ||North-west Orkney||4365||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|| JNCC |- ||Norwegian Boundary Sediment Plain||164||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Noss Head||8||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Papa Westray||33||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Rosemary Bank Seamount||6927||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation|| JNCC |- ||Small Isles||803||18 November 2016||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||South Arran||280||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation ||NatureScot |- ||The Barra Fan and Hebrides Terrace Seamount||4373||7 August 2014|| Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Turbot Bank||251||7 August 2014|| Nature Conservation || JNCC |- ||Upper Loch Fyne and Loch Goil||88||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation ||NatureScot |- ||West Shetland Shelf||4083||7 August 2014>||Nature Conservation||JNCC |- ||Wester Ross||599||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation||NatureScot |- ||Wyre and Rousay Sounds||16||7 August 2014||Nature Conservation ||NatureScot |- |} | |} ===Demonstration and Research MPA=== There is one Demonstration and Research MPA, in the waters surrounding Fair Isle.

The four sites being considered are: *North-east Lewis *Shiant East Bank *Sea of the Hebrides *Southern Trench Two further Historic MPAs are also proposed as of 2019, with an Historic Environment Scotland consultation exercise having closed on 27 November. The two proposed sites are: *The wreck of the Swedish East India Company ship Queen of Sweden in Bressay Sound, Shetland *10.7 km2 of Scapa Flow, Orkney, including the site of the scuttled German High Seas Fleet. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ===Citations=== ==External links== *Scotland\u2019s Marine Protected Area network - NatureScot *Marine Heritage - Historic Environment Scotland Category:Lists of protected areas of Scotland Category:Marine Protected Areas of Scotland ",
