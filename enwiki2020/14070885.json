    "text": "Sandringham School is a secondary school with academy status in Marshalswick, St Albans, Hertfordshire. It was established in 1988 following a merger of two local schools, Marshalswick School and Wheathampstead School. It occupies the former Marshalswick site, adjacent to Wheatfields Infant and Junior schools. The former Wheathampstead site was used as a training centre by Hertfordshire County Council until 2007 and is now awaiting redevelopment for housing. The school works in partnership with two neighbouring schools to enhance post-16 educational provision. This partnership is known as \"BeauSandVer\" and consists of Sandringham School, Verulam School and Beaumont School. Sandringham school primarily serves neighbourhoods in the north east of St Albans (Marshalswick and Jersey Farm) and the villages of Sandridge and Wheathampstead. The school, from 2019, admits eight forms of entry each year but has admitted extra forms in 2015 (7 total), 2016(7 total), 2017(8 total), 2018 (8 total) and 2019 (8 total, although the extra form in 2019 was later entered into the new Hepworth house). ==Achievements and recognition== The school has specialisms in Arts, Science and Leading Edge. The school has also been awarded High Performing Specialist School status by the SSAT on three successive occasions. It has received the School Achievement Award. The school is an Accredited Initial Teacher Training Provider (AITTP) which offers QTS through the GTP programme. The most recent Ofsted inspection described the school as \"outstanding\". The school has hosted a world record attempt for outdoor aerobatics and a world record attempt for the largest lesson. On 8 January 2016, pupils from the school made the first amateur radio call to a British astronaut at the International Space Station, contacting Tim Peake as part of his Principia mission during Expedition 46. ==SandPit Theatre== The School has used its specialism in the Arts to build and maintain a professional quality theatre on site. Opened in 2001 (at a cost of \u00a31,000,000) the SandPit is used by the school and community and hosts productions and charity events. The SandPit is also used as a teaching space and as a venue for school assemblies. ==References== ==External links== * Sandringham School * Sandpit Theatre * BeauSandVer Category:Academies in Hertfordshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1988 Category:Schools in St Albans Category:Secondary schools in Hertfordshire Category:1988 establishments in England ",
