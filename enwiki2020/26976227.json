It was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. US EDT, but began at 9:24 US EDT due to a rain delay the race began. It was telecast on TNT and Motor Racing Network (terrestrial) and Sirius XM Radio (satellite) by radio at 6:30 p.m. EDT. Kevin Harvick won the race, while Kasey Kahne finished second and Jeff Gordon finished third. There were a total of nine cautions, one red flag, and 47 lead changes among 18 different drivers. This was also the final race at Daytona on the pavement surface used since 1979. Re-paving the track was moved up two years due to pothole problems in the 2010 Daytona 500. Several preventive repairs were made between practice and qualifying sessions, but there were no delays at any time through the weekend because of potholes. Repaving began almost immediately after the race. ==Report== ===Background=== Prior to the race, Richard Childress Racing driver Kevin Harvick led the Drivers' Championship with 2,489 points, and Hendrick Motorsports driver Jimmie Johnson was second with 2,384 points.

However, pre-race ceremonies continued, as Pastor Corwin Lasenby, Sr., from New Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church delivered the invocation. Then, Capitol Records Nashville recording artist Darius Rucker performed the United States National Anthem. By 8:13, forty-three minutes after the scheduled start time, the showers had moved away, and dryers started to dry the track. 43 minutes later, crew members and the drivers were called to pit road.
