In March 2016, the commanding officer of the Typhoon, Lieutenant Commander Jeremiah Daley was removed from command after a Navy investigation had found that he had \"failed to maintain equipment to the point of exposing 'his crew to unnecessary risk,' interfered with an inquiry into his actions and once slept drunk on a bench at a Dubai port.\"Jon Gambrell, US Navy boots 'drunk, reckless' Gulf boat commander, Associated Press (April 22, 2016). The 300-page report on the investigation into Daley, which began in February 2016, was compiled by the Navy and acquired by the Associated Press via a Freedom of Information Act request.
