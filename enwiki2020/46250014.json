    "text": "Where Are You Dying Tonight? is a 1981 novel by the French writer Michel D\u00e9on. Its French title is Un d\u00e9jeuner de soleil, which literally means \"a sun's breakfast\" and is an expression for something short-lived. It tells the story of Stanislas Beren, a fictional 20th-century novelist, with excerpts from his novels and the events from his life that inspired them. An English translation by Julian Evans was published in 1983. ==Reception== G. S. Bourdain of The New York Times called the book \"highly literate\" and wrote: \"The story, which begins in 1925 and ends in 1977, is a delicious merging of narrative passages with excerpts from Stanislas' writings (footnotes included) and flashbacks to the events of his life that inspired those writings, not to mention numerous references to actual books, poems, paintings and people. ... The novel's citations of authors from Rimbaud to Maugham, descriptive phrases about paintings by artists from Giorgione to Picasso and mentions of real people from the period in which the book takes place are not only fun but also make one want to follow the Berens' trail through London and Paris to the art museums and trattorias of Venice. And the felicitous translation by Julian Evans never stumbles.\" Evans, the translator, wrote about the English-language edition: \"The reviews it garnered were excellent; the sales made me want to weep.\" ==References== ==External links== * Publicity page at the French publisher's website Category:1981 French novels Category:French-language novels Category:Novels about writers Category:Novels by Michel D\u00e9on Category:\u00c9ditions Gallimard books ",
