The book made it to the top of the New York Times bestseller list. The hardcover edition was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons in 2002, with the paperback being released a year later by The Berkley Publishing Group in the U.S., and by Time Warner in the UK. The name of the book comes from McEnroe's famous outburst \"You cannot be serious!\" from his match against Tom Gullikson at the 1981 Wimbledon Championships. ==Notes== Category:2002 non-fiction books Category:Tennis books Category:G.
