    "text": "\"Hang You Up\" is the second single from Yellowcard's seventh album When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes, released on February 22, 2011, on iTunes. The song was originally written by lead singer Ryan Key for the side project Big If, a project he was involved in between 2008-2010, while Yellowcard was on a hiatus.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ge94jws5z0 ==Music video== A music video was filmed in January and premiered on MTV.com on April 5, 2011.http://www.mtv.com/videos/yellowcard/634616/hang-you-up.jhtml#id=1568964 The song features the band's frontman Ryan Key walking as he sings \"Hang You Up\". He stops to tie his shoelace, and his singing disturbs a man who is on his phone. He enters his workplace (a diner called Angelo's Hamburgers), where he drinks from a customer's beverage while singing and looking at a picture of his ex-girlfriend. He enters his station where he serves customers at the drive-through area, where a customer, while ordering through the talkbox, is cut off by Ryan's singing. He then spots his ex-girlfriend outside and goes out to see her. As he sings to her, she reminds him that she was granted a court order that prevents Key from singing to her within five hundred feet. As she leaves with her friend (who is shown to be attracted to Ryan), he walks away and goes to the parking lot where the band is playing, he picks up an acoustic guitar, and the band plays the song together in the parking lot. As the song ends, the woman who accompanied Ryan's ex-girlfriend gives Ryan her cell phone number, remarking \"you can sing me a pre-chorus anytime\", a reference to something than Ryan's ex-girlfriend said earlier (Ryan can then be seen raising one of his eyebrows as the woman leaves). The video ends with the man on his cell-phone from earlier who is finally left undisturbed by Ryan and the band. ==Chart Performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2011) !Peak position |- |US Rock Digital Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|30 |- |} ==References== Category:Yellowcard songs Category:2011 singles Category:2011 songs Category:Songs written by Ryan Key Category:Hopeless Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Neal Avron ",
