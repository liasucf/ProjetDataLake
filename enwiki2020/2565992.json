    "text": "Florent Vollant (born August 10, 1959 in Labrador) is a Canadian singer- songwriter. An Innu from Maliotenam, Quebec, he was half of the popular folk music duo Kashtin, one of the most important musical groups in First Nations history. He has subsequently released four solo albums. In 1997, Vollant built his own recording studio \u2013 Makusham \u2013 on the reserve which is used by musicians inside and outside the community. His solo album Puamuna, which means dreams in Innu, was the first time Vollant recorded a full album in his own studio. His Innu-language album of Christmas songs, Nipaiamianan, earned him an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, as well as the Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year in 2001. In 2020 he served as executive producer of Call Me Human (Je m'appelle humain), Kim O'Bomsawin's documentary film about Innu poet Jos\u00e9phine Bacon. ==Discography== * Katak (2003) * Nipaiamianan (2005) * Eku Mamu (2009) * Puamuna (2015) * Mishta Meshkenu (2018) == References == ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:20th-century First Nations people Category:21st-century First Nations people Category:Canadian documentary film producers Category:Canadian folk singer-songwriters Category:Canadian male singer-songwriters Category:First Nations musicians Category:Innu people Category:Juno Award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year winners Category:Living people Category:People from C\u00f4te-Nord Category:Singers from Quebec ",
