    "text": "James Solomon \"Big Jim\" Nance (December 30, 1942 \u2013 June 17, 1992) was an American professional football player who was a fullback with the Boston Patriots during their days in the American Football League (AFL). He was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2009. He played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen. ==High school career== Wrestling for the Indiana, PA high school, Nance was a two time Pennsylvania heavyweight champion in 1960 and 1961. It is said that the PIAA (PA's governing body) added the heavyweight class to accommodate Nance, who was too large for their highest weight class in 1959, which was 185 pounds. ==College career== Starting for three years at Syracuse University, Nance tied the school record for career touchdowns (13) and led the Orangemen in rushing in 1964, scoring in ten straight games. In 1963 and 1965 Jim Nance was the NCAA heavyweight wrestling champion and received All-America honors. ==Professional career== Nance was a 19th round selection of the Boston Patriots in the 1965 AFL Draft, as well as a 4th round selection of the Chicago Bears in the 1965 NFL Draft. Nance signed with the Patriots. Though his rookie season was unimpressive, he led the AFL in rushing the next two seasons. He went on to become the only AFL player ever to rush for more than 1,400 yards in a season. At 6-1 and 260 pounds, Nance was a powerful fullback who carried 299 times in 1966, for 11 touchdowns and 1,458 yards. That season, he rushed for 208 yards and two touchdowns in a 24\u201321 victory over the Oakland Raiders. Nance was an American Football League All- Star in 1966, when he also received the league's Most Valuable Player award, and an All-Star again in 1967 when he became the only AFL player to have consecutive seasons with over 1,000 yards, this time 1,216. He retired as the Patriots' all-time leading rusher with 46 career touchdowns, a record he still holds. In 1972, he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles but refused to play for them, temporarily retiring. He joined the New York Jets the following year. In 1974, Nance played with the Houston Texans/Shreveport Steamer of the World Football League, rushing for 1,240 yards. In 1975, he ran for 767 yards before the WFL folded. He is the all-time leading rusher in the WFL with 490 carries for 2,007 yards and a 4.1 average. He rushed for 15 touchdowns in his WFL career. ==Death== Nance suffered a heart attack and stroke in 1983. He died on June 17, 1992, of a heart attack in Quincy, Massachusetts.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NancJi00.htm ==References== ==External links== * The Pennsylvania Football News All- Century Team * Jim Nance obituary \u2013 New York Times Category:1942 births Category:1992 deaths Category:American Football League Most Valuable Players Category:American Football League All-Star players Category:American football running backs Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Boston Patriots players Category:New England Patriots players Category:New York Jets players Category:Houston Texans (WFL) players Category:Shreveport Steamer players Category:American Football League rushing leaders Category:People from Indiana, Pennsylvania Category:Syracuse Orange football players Category:New England Patriots broadcasters Category:National Football League announcers Category:American Football League players ",
