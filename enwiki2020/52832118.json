    "text": "The Bishop Worthington Residence was built at 1240 South 10th Street in Omaha, Nebraska in 1885. The personal home of Bishop George Worthington of the Episcopal Church, the Worthington Mansion was a place of high social and religious importance during the pioneer era of Omaha history. During its history, the mansion also served as the second Presbyterian Hospital and as the White House Apartments. == Design == The location of the Worthington Mansion reflected his great wealth on arrival to Omaha. The banking family of brothers Herman and Augustus Kountze established an exclusive neighborhood for wealthy people on South 10th Street, due south of downtown Omaha, in the early 1880s. Herman Kountze's estate was called Forest Hill, and was renowned for one of the most commanding views of Omaha. Bishop Worthington had his mansion constructed adjacent to Brownell Hall, an Episcopalian girls boarding school, and its accompanying chapel, St. Matthias Episcopal Church. Gordon W. Lloyd, an English-trained architect who worked in Detroit, was the architect of the Worthington Mansion. Lloyd was noted as a designer of Episcopal churches and related buildings, and was from Worthington's former diocese in Michigan. Designed in the high Queen Anne style, the home has retained many of its original interior features. They include 26 rooms, a grand staircase, large parlor, separate devotional room, a large library and den, as well as many bedrooms. Originally, the arms of the local Episcopalian diocese were cut into the glass on the front doors, which also had the personal arms of Bishop Worthington on the inner doors of the vestibule.\"A bachelor bishop,\" Omaha World-Herald, August 28, 1885Mead & Hunt, Inc.

Soon after its construction, Bishop Worthington's sister and brother moved from Ohio and New York to join him living in his mansion.

During this early era the Worthington Hospital, named in honor of the Bishop, was built nearby at South 10th and Pierce Streets, too. == After Worthington == In the early 1900s, the Worthington Mansion became home to the Presbyterian Hospital. It was one of several mansions that were acquired by for the hospital. However, by the 1930s the hospital had moved out and the building became home to the Lutheran Home for the Aged.\"Frederick Haas dies,\" Omaha World-Herald March 20, 1937.

During this era, the Order of the Sons of Italy moved into 1238 South 10th Street, which was the original carriage house for the mansion.Center for Public Affairs Research (1-1-1979) \"Omaha Awareness Tours: The Near South Side.\" Omaha, NE: University of Nebraska at Omaha.
