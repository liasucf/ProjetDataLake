Mashiane was being chased by police in the Pretoria suburb of Marabastad when he jumped underneath a bus. Mashiane started his murderous activity in 1977 by killing his girlfriend. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and was released in 1982. After being released, he immediately started his spate of murder and sodomy, accounting for the deaths of at least 12 young boys by strangulation or stoning. One victim is known to have survived Mashiane's attention.\u2018\u2018Frances Farmers Revenge\u2019\u2019 : Johannes Mashiane. == References == Category:1989 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:Prisoners and detainees of South Africa Category:South African serial killers Category:Serial killers who committed suicide Category:South African murderers of children Category:South African rapists Category:South African prisoners and detainees Category:Suicides in South Africa Category:Violence against men in Africa Category:Year of birth missing Category:Road incident deaths in South Africa ",
