    "text": "Cannabis in the Solomon Islands is illegal for the production, sale, and possession of marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes. Offenders receive a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of ten years. A 2011 survey of young people, found that 16.1% of males and 11.1% of females had ever used cannabis. The Solomon Islands, like other island nations in the West Pacific is utilised as a staging point in the illicit drug trade, between South East Asia and Australasia. Cannabis is also illicitly cultivated in the Solomon Islands. ==References== Solomon Islands Category:Healthcare in the Solomon Islands Category:Politics of the Solomon Islands ",
