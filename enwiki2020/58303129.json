    "text": "The lyc\u00e9e Claude-Monet is a French public educational institution established in 1955. It consists of college, high school, and preparatory classes. It is located at 1, rue du Docteur-Magnan, in the 13th arrondissement of Paris close to the Quartier Asiatique. It is close to the parc de Choisy, stade Charles- Moureu and centre Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, a university centre attached to the Pantheon-Sorbonne University. ==Teaching== The campus consists of more than students, mostly living in the 13th arrondissement. The lyc\u00e9e offers a choice of options around artistic specialities (music, theatre, plastic arts, ancient languages - Latic and Greek), sciences, and economics. There is also a European English section, a European Italian section, an international Chinese section (courses on literature and maths in Chinese), and an international Italian section preparing for the EsaBac (French baccalaur\u00e9at and Italian esame di Stato). The lyc\u00e9e also offers courses in Chinese in inter- establishment languages (LIE). The college also welcomes disabled students to its ULIS classes. The lyc\u00e9e runs preparatory economics and literature classes. Since 2013, the college also accepts students studying with CHAM (classes combined with music) in partnership with the conservatoire Maurice Ravel (Paris 13th). ==History== The lyc\u00e9e was built in 1955 by the architect Roger S\u00e9assal, grand Prix de Rome. It is, like the neighbouring Parc de Choisy located on the former gasworks of the avenue de Choisy. Construction began at the end of the 1920s, which explains its architecture. Its construction was interrupted by the Great Depression and World War II. It resumed after the war, and was completed in 1955. An important renovation took place from 1998. The murals decorating the lyc\u00e9e were created by: * Jean Dupas (1882-1964) frescos Jeux de Cartes and Jeux d'\u00e9checs in the entrance hall, dated 1954 and 1956 ; * Jean Bouchaud (1891-1977); * Yves Brayer. Two options were proposed for the name of the lyc\u00e9e : Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and Claude Monet. Eventually, the name chosen for the lyc\u00e9e was Claude Monet. In exchange, the grandson of Claude Monet gave the tableau Nymph\u00e9as avec rameaux de saule, now shown in the headmaster's office. Gabriel Faur\u00e9 eventually had a lyc\u00e9e nearby named after him, at 81, avenue de Choisy.

There are three school libraries in the lyc\u00e9e (one for the college, one for the lyc\u00e9e, and one for the preparatory classes), two music rooms, and a 200-seat theatre. In the basement, there is a gym, a dojo, multiple locker rooms, and a 150-seat conference room. The ground floor contains administration offices, the infirmary, the refectory and a parlor. Outside, the lyc\u00e9e has almost entirely been adapted for people with reduced mobility: there are two lifts and an access ramp near to the stoop. == Ranking of the lyc\u00e9e == In 2017, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 20th out of 115 at departmental level in terms of teaching quality, and 106th at national level.http://www.parisetudiant.com/etudiant/annuaire- lycees/lycee/lycee-claude-monet-paris/palmares.html The ranking was based on three criteria: the results of the bac, the proportion of students who obtain the baccalaur\u00e9at having completed their final two years of schooling at the establishment, and the value added (calculated from the social background of students, their age, and their results in the national diploma). == CPGE rankings == The national rankings of preparatory classes in major schools (CPGE) which measures the entry levels of students to the grandes \u00e9coles.In 2016, L'\u00c9tudiant gave the following rankings: {| class=\"wikitable\" !School !2016 !2015 |- |HEC |0,0 % (0/35) |2,9 % (1/34) |- |ESCP Europe, ESSEC, HEC |2,9 % (1/35) |2,9 % (1/34) |- |EDHEC, EM Lyon, ENS Cachan, ESCP Europe, ESSEC, HEC |17,1 % (6/35) |5,9 % (2/34) |- |HEC, ESSEC, ESCP Europe, EM Lyon, EDHEC, Audencia, ENS Cachan, Grenoble EM, Neoma (Reims + Rouen), Toulouse Business School, Kedge (Bordeaux + Marseille) |65,7 % (23/35) |50,0 % (17/34) |} Pr\u00e9pas literary option, science, literature, humanities {| class=\"wikitable\" !School !2015 !2014 !2013 !2012 !2011 !Average over 5 years |- |ENS LSH |1,7 % (1/59) |0,0 % (0/59) |1,5 % (1/66) |5,1 % (4/79) |2,2 % (1/46) |2,3 % |- |Moyenne nationale |3,2 % |3,4 % |3,1 % |3,5 % |3,7 % |3,3 % |- |ENS LSH, Top 5 ESC |1,7 % (1/59) |0,0 % (0/59) |6,1 % (4/66) |6,3 % (5/79) |4,3 % (2/46) |3,9 % |- |National average |5,0 % |5,2 % |4,9 % |5,1 % |5,5 % |5,1 % |- |ENS-LSH, Celsa, Esit, Isit, Ismapp, the 9 IEP, BCE and Ecricome business schools, Dauphine, Masters ENS |11,9 % (7/59) |18,6 % (11/59) |12,1 % (8/66) |15,2 % (12/79) |17,4 % (8/46) |14,9 % |- |National average |20,3 % |18,9 % |19,9 % |17,8 % |13,3 % |18,2 % |} === Major works === == Works == * Claude Monet, Nymph\u00e9as avec rameaux de saule, 1916, oil on canvas 160 x ;, at the lyc\u00e9e website * Ren\u00e9 Perrot, Tapisserie d'Aubusson, 1956, woven by the House of Hamot, headquarters of the Mobilier National, in the parlor;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Marcel-Armand Gaumont, Premices; * Jean Dupas, painted mural, oil on strengthened canvas, 1954 and 1956, lyc\u00e9e hall;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Alfred Janniot, Baigneuse \u00e0 la draperie, 1950, in the lyc\u00e9e hall;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Yves Brayer, fresque dans une salle de physique;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Blanche Hosched\u00e9 Monet, Les pins maritimes, 1928;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Antoine Sartorio, Le Rythme, sculpture in the hall of the lyc\u00e9e, on the lyc\u00e9e website;, on the lyc\u00e9e website * Five basins, including a Georges Serr\u00e9, adorning the stairs of the lyc\u00e9e., on the lyc\u00e9e website ==Annex of the lyc\u00e9e Claude-Monet== An annex to the lyc\u00e9e Claude-Monet is located in the Georges-Heuyer clinic (a French-language student healthcare institution).
