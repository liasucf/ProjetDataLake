    "text": "Domnall mac Murchada (died 1075),Byrne (2001). also known as Domnall mac Murchada meic Diarmata,Moody; Martin; Byrne (2005) p. 209. was a leading late eleventh-century claimant to the Kingdom of Leinster, and a King of Dublin. As a son of Murchad mac Diarmata, King of Dublin and the Isles, Domnall was a grandson of Diarmait mac M\u00e1el na mB\u00f3, King of Leinster, and thus a member of the U\u00ed Chennselaig. Domnall was also the first of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the U\u00ed Chennselaig named after his father. In 1071, the year before his grandfather's death, Domnall and an U\u00ed Chennselaig kinsman, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair, battled for control of Leinster. Although Domnall is accorded the title King of Leinster in one mediaeval king-list, Donnchad was evidently a more powerful claimant, and Domnall appears to have held the Leinster kingship in name only. Domnall's rise to power in the Kingdom of Dublin took place in 1075, after the expulsion of the reigning Gofraid mac Amla\u00edb meic Ragnaill, King of Dublin by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to wrench the kingdom from the grip of the U\u00ed Briain, or he may have been installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship. Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne. ==Background== Locations relating to Domnall's life and times. Domnall was a son of Murchad mac Diarmata, King of Dublin and the Isles,Hudson, B (2005a); Byrne (2001) p. 290 tab. 10; Duffy (1992) pp. 102\u2013103; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) pp. 20, 21. who was himself a son of Diarmait mac M\u00e1el na mB\u00f3, King of Leinster.Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (1992) pp. 102\u2013103; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) pp. 20, 21. Domnall was, therefore, a member of the U\u00ed Chennselaig;\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 20. as well as the first of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the U\u00ed ChennselaigDownham (2018) p. 268; Zumbuhl (2005). named after his father.Duffy (1992) p. 102; Zumbuhl (2005). Domnall had two brothers: Donnchad, a later King of Leinster, and \u00c9nna.Byrne (2001) p. 290 tab. 10; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 20. In 1052, Domnall's aforesaid grandfather conquered the Kingdom of Dublin from Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, and soon after appointed Murchad as King of Dublin. About a decade later, Murchad appears to have driven Echmarcach from Mann,Duffy (2006) p. 55; Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (2002) pp. 53\u201354; Duffy (1993b) p. 14. after which he gained the kingship of the Isles.Duffy (1993) p. 14. Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted for two decades, and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished.Duffy (1993b) p. 14; Duffy (1992) pp. 100\u2013101. Unfortunately for the U\u00ed Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sons\u2014Murchad and Gl\u00fan Iairn\u2014unexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070,Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, B (2005b); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (2002) p. 54; Hudson, B (1994) p. 149; Duffy (1993b) p. 14; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) pp. 19, 20. and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, B (2005b); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (2002) p. 54; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) pp. 19, 20. ==Kingship of Leinster== Even before Diarmait's demise, the U\u00ed Chennselaig began to fight amongst themselves in a struggle that was almost certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths.Hudson, B (2005b); \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 19. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) \u00a7 1071.12; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) \u00a7 1071.12; Duffy (1992) p. 101. and the eleventh- to fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled against the forces of his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair, before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) \u00a7 1071.2; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) \u00a7 1071.2; Hudson, B (2005a); Hudson, B (2005b); Hudson, BT (2004); Hudson, B (1994) p. 149, 149 n. 22. Up until about the time of his death, Diarmait had been the most powerful king in southern Ireland.\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 19. In consequence of the void left by his demise, Diarmait's erstwhile ally Toirdelbach seized the initiative, and moved to enforce his own claim to the high-kingship of Ireland.Flanagan (2008) p. 900; Lydon (2005) p. 38; Duffy (1993b) pp. 14\u201315; Duffy (1992) p. 101. He immediately imposed his overlordship on LeinsterLydon (2005) p. 38; Duffy (1993b) pp. 14\u201315; Duffy (1992) pp. 101\u2013102; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 19.\u2014a task almost certainly expedited by the aforesaid infighting amongst the U\u00ed Chennselaig\u2014and took control of Dublin.Lydon (2005) p. 38; Bracken (2004); Hudson, BT (2004); Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1993b) pp. 14\u201315; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 19. Whilst the imposition of authority upon rival provincial kingdoms was a fundamental part in gaining the high-kingship, Toirdelbach's decision to march-on Dublin reveals that the acquisition of this coastal kingdom had also become an essential part of the process.Duffy (1993b) pp. 14\u201315, 18. Toirdelbach's subsequent capture of Donnchad in Dublin suggests that the latter was not only the leading U\u00ed Chennselaig dynast,\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 21. but was also in the process of using the town as the capital of Leinster.Duffy (1992) p. 101. Although the list of Leinster kings in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster declares that Domnall had succeeded his grandfather as King of Leinster, it is apparent that Donnchad was indeed the more powerful claimant. In fact, the king-list of U\u00ed Chennselaig in the same source makes no notice of Domnall, and states that it was Donnchad who succeeded Diarmait as King of U\u00ed Chennselaig. Domnall, therefore, may not have reigned in Leinster, and could well have been King of Leinster in name only.Book of Leinster (2012) \u00a7\u00a7 5405\u20135585; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) pp. 9 n. 9, 19\u201321. If the Annals of Inisfallen is to be believed, Toirdelbach acquired possession of Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) \u00a7 1072.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) \u00a7 1072.4; Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1992) p. 102. Although this record may be mere U\u00ed Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amla\u00edb meic Ragnaill.Duffy (2006) p. 57; Duffy (1992) p. 102. The latter appears to have been a kinsman of Echmarcach,Duffy (2006) p. 57. and may well have been handed the kinship by Toirdelbach,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 232. perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.Duffy (1993b) p. 15. ==Kingship of Dublin== Excerpt from Trinity College Dublin 1339, page 39 (the Book of Leinster) concerning Domnall and Donnchad, and the succession of the kingship of Leinster.Book of Leinster (2012) \u00a7\u00a7 5491\u20135495; Trinity College Dublin MS 1339 (n.d.). Despite Domnall's inclusion here, it is uncertain how much authority he had in Leinster. In 1075, Toirdelbach drove Gofraid from the kingship and Ireland itself.Duffy (2009) pp. 295\u2013296; Flanagan (2008) p. 900; Duffy (2006) p. 58; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 167; Hudson, B (1994) p. 152, 152 n. 41; Duffy (1992) p. 102; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (n.d.) p. 34. There is uncertainty concerning the circumstances of Gofraid's expulsion, and of Domnall's accession.Hudson, B (2006) p. 116; Hudson, B (2005b); Hudson, BT (2005) p. 167; Hudson, B (1994) p. 152. On one hand, it is possible that Gofraid was involved in lending assistance to Anglo-Danish resistance against the Norman regime in the recently conquered Kingdom of England. If correct, Gofraid would appear to have been at odds with Toirdelbach, a monarch who appears to have cultivated close links with the Norman regime.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 167; Hudson, B (1994) pp. 152\u2013153. Domnall, therefore, may have had Toirdelbach's consent to rule in Dublin as Gofraid's replacement.Mac Shamhr\u00e1in (1996) p. 98; Duffy (1992) p. 103; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 21. In fact, Toirdelbach's placement of Domnall in Dublin, and his allowance of the latter's aforesaid cousin in Leinster, may have been a way in which the U\u00ed Briain exploited the fractured U\u00ed Chennselaig. Certainly, Domnall's cooperation would have been a valuable asset to Toirdelbach, considering the prominence of his father amongst the Dubliners, and the likelihood that Domnall himself may have lived most of his life there.Duffy (1992) pp. 102\u2013103. On the other hand, it is possible that Gofraid was driven from the kingship because he had aligned himself with the Leinstermen against the U\u00ed Briain. If such a sequence of events is correct it could mean that, even though Gofraid was unable continue on with the revolt, it was his U\u00ed Chennselaig confederates who succeeded in securing Dublin from the U\u00ed Briain. Whatever the circumstances of Domnall's accession, the U\u00ed Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) \u00a7 1075.6; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) \u00a7 1075.6; The Annals of Ulster (2017) \u00a7 1075.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) \u00a7 1075.3; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) \u00a7 1075.3; The Annals of Ulster (2008) \u00a7 1075.4; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 167; Duffy (1992) p. 103. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship.The Annals of Ulster (2017) \u00a7 1075.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) \u00a7 1075.3; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) \u00a7 1075.3; The Annals of Ulster (2008) \u00a7 1075.4; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (1971) p. 21. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach, appointed King of Dublin.N\u00ed Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 154; Hudson, B (2005b); Mac Shamhr\u00e1in (1996) p. 99; Duffy (1992) p. 103. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin,Flanagan (2008) p. 900. and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.Duffy (1993a) p. 34; Duffy (1992) p. 103; \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in (n.d.) p. 34. ==Ancestry== ==Notes== ==Citations== ==References== ===Primary sources=== * * * * * * * * * * * ===Secondary sources=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1075 deaths Category:11th-century Irish monarchs Category:Kings of Leinster Category:Monarchs of Dublin Category:U\u00ed Ceinnselaig ",
