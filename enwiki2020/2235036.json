The school is centrally located in Howard County and its district borders that of River Hill High School, Marriotts Ridge High School, Centennial High School, Howard High School, Oakland Mills High School, and Atholton High School. ==History== Bids were requested by January 1970 for a 1,350-seat school to be built for an estimated $2.6 million. Opened in 1971 as a model school for the nation, it was Columbia's first high school. It had an open doughnut-shaped design with \"open classrooms\" and was a model school for new teaching settings.\"Five Open Plan High Schools: A Report from Educational Facilities Laboratories\" (1973) (archived at Texas A&M; University). In 1994, the original 910-student building which did not meet current safety standards was demolished. A new $20 million 1,200-seat building with a more traditional style was reconstructed on the same site by Cochran, Stephenson and Donkevoet. The new building, opened in 1996, replicates the open idea, with a central main street, and halls surrounding it and a bridge across the second floor. ==Students== {| class=wikitable |+Student population |- !1990!!1991!!1992!!1993!!1994!!1995!!1996!!1997!!1998!!1999 |- |unk.||unk.||unk.||822||848||1037||1228||1342||1418||1452 |- |- !2000!!2001!!2002!!2003!!2004!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009 |- |1,414||1,480||1,567||1,489||1,440||1,392||1,434||1,373||1,351||1,370 |- !2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018 |- |1,335||1,324||1,277||1,271||1,242||1,234||1,236||1,225||1,276 |} The racial makeup of the population during the 2017\u20132018 school year was 26.7% White, 43.8% Black or African American, 7.2% Asian, 14.6% Hispanic or Latino, 0% Native American, 0.4% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 7.4% two or more races. ==Jim Rouse Theatre== Wilde Lake has a modern 750-seat theater named for Columbia founder James Rouse, who went by \"Jim\".
