    "text": "The medal table of the 2016 Summer Paralympics ranks the participating National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) by the number of gold medals won by their athletes during the competition. The 2016 Paralympics was the fifteenth Games to be held, a quadrennial competition open to athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. The games were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 7 September to 18 September Athletes from 63 NPCs won at least one gold medal, with a total of 83 having won at least one medal of any colour. Athletes from Cape Verde, Georgia, Mozambique, Qatar, Uganda, and Vietnam won their first Paralympic medals. Of those nations, the National Olympic Committee of Cape Verde had never won an Olympic medal. Kazakhstan won their first medals at the Summer Paralympics, having previously won a silver medal at the Winter Paralympic Games. Georgia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam won their first Paralympic gold medals. China won the most medals in the 2016 Paralympics. == Medal table == The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If NPCs are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code. In the judo competition, an additional thirteen bronze medals were awarded as the winners of the two repechage brackets (for those who lost to the eventual finalists) each received a bronze medal. The swimming also saw multiple instances of the same medals being awarded, in the men's 100m backstroke S11, both Wojciech Makowski and Bradley Snyder swam a dead heat in the final and were both awarded a silver medal, resulting in no bronze medal being given that for event, in the men's 100m breaststroke SB13, both Oleksii Fedyna and Firdavsbek Musabekov swam a dead heat in the final and were both awarded a gold medal, resulting in no silver medal being given that for event. In both the women's 50, freestyle S11, two bronze medals were awarded each as two swimmers set the same time in third place. No bronze medal was awarded in the 4 \u00d7 400 Relay as only two teams completed the event. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. ==See also== * 2016 Summer Olympics medal table ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * International Paralympic Committee Medal table Category:Summer Paralympics medal tables ",
