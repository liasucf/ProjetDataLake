    "text": "The Constitution of Burkina Faso was approved by referendum on 2 June 1991, formally adopted 11 June 1991 and last amended in January 2002. The last amendment abolished the upper chamber of the parliament, the Chamber of Representatives. In 2015, President Kabor\u00e9 promised to revise the 1991 constitution. The revision was completed in 2018. One condition prevents any individual from serving as president for more than ten years either consecutively or intermittently and provides a method for impeaching a president. A referendum on the constitution for the Fifth Republic was erroneously announced for March 24, 2019, but has not actually been officially scheduled. Certain rights are also enshrined in the revision: access to drinking water, to decent housing and a recognition of the right to civil disobedience, for example. The referendum was required because the opposition parties in Parliament refused to sanction the revised wording.http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180827-burkina-faso-le-referendum- constitutionnel-prevu-le-24-mars-2019 ==References== ==External links== *Constitution of Burkina Faso in English *Constitution of Burkina Faso in French Burkina Faso Category:Politics of Burkina Faso ",
