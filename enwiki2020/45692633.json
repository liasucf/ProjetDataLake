A short \"Duet\" (which teams the leader with Pedersen) is a change-of-pace and much freer. These two records are historical curiosities but feature much less interaction between the trio and Anthony Braxton than one would hope\".Yanow, S., Allmusic Review, accessed March 17, 2015 ==Track listing== # \"What's New?\" (Johnny Burke, Bob Haggart) - 9:58 # \"Duet\" (Anthony Braxton, Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen) - 3:30 # \"Body and Soul\" (Frank Eyton, Johnny Green, Edward Heyman, Robert Sour) - 10:17 # \"Marshmallow\" (Warne Marsh) - 6:42 Bonus track on CD reissue # \"Donna Lee\" (Charlie Parker) - 6:35 # \"My Funny Valentine\" (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) - 8:07 # \"Half Nelson\" (Miles Davis) - 4:15 ==Personnel== *Anthony Braxton \u2013 alto saxophone, contrabass clarinet *Tete Montoliu - piano *Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen - bass *Albert Heath - drums ==References== Category:SteepleChase Records albums Category:Anthony Braxton albums Category:1976 albums ",
