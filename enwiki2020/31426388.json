From 1860, the park together with the surrounding Victorian and Edwardian houses were laid out by Christ's Hospital of Abingdon. Architects who worked on the estate included Edwin Dolby (1838\u20131900), his pupil, J. G. Timothy West (1860\u20131931), and A. B. West (1885\u20131957), as well as John Gibbs who designed the 1865 stone monument to Prince Albert in the park. This memorial was built by Charles Selby.\"The Abingdon Albert Memorial\", The Builder, December 19, 1863, p.896 == Location == Park Crescent runs along the west, north and east sides of the park in a large crescent shape around the park. A spur of Park Crescent continues to the north. The straight Park Road is to the south of the park and also continues to the east and the west. Conduit Road runs south from the southeastern corner of Albert Park. It is named after the water conduit that used to run in line with the current road. This conduit carried spring water from Albert Park to a water fountain in Ock Street. == Gallery == File:Albert Park in Abingdon - geograph.org.uk - 1299787.jpg|View of Albert Park with the memorial to Prince Albert in the distance File:Albert Park, Abingdon - geograph.org.uk - 15093.jpg|View of the memorial to Prince Albert File:Abingdon Bowls Club - geograph.org.uk - 15096.jpg|Abingdon Bowls Club in Albert Park File:Conduit Road, Abingdon - geograph.org.uk - 15084.jpg|Conduit Road, leading south from the southeastern corner of Albert Park == References == == External links == * Abingdon Town Council information Category:Parks and open spaces in Oxfordshire Category:Abingdon-on-Thames ",
