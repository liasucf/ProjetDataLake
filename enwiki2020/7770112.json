It peaked at #13 in the UK singles chart. Prior to its release it had been adapted for a popular television commercial for Halifax Bank in which Brown could be seen singing and dancing. Belgian singer and actor Pieter Van Keymeulen released a stripped down version of the song to commemorate his father's death in 2019. ==In popular culture== The song is featured in the films Money Talks (1997; also on its CD soundtrack album, where White had recorded an alternative version, as simply \"My Everything\" as a duet with Faith Evans), Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004; also on its CD soundtrack album), Zookeeper (2011), and anachronistically in Tim Burton's film Dark Shadows (2012; also on its CD soundtrack album) as the film was set in 1972, two years before the song was released. It was also in many episodes of the Fox series Ally McBeal (1997\u20132002), accompanying John Cage (Peter MacNicol) during his life most of the time. Whenever he gets into a difficult situation, he withdraws and concentrates on the song, hearing it and dancing to it, to regain strength and concentrate on whatever comes along. White himself appeared in a season 2 episode to perform the song while John Cage and other characters performed his signature line dance to the song. The song is featured in the music video game Just Dance 4 (2012) for PlayStation 3, Wii, Wii U, and Xbox 360. This song was used in a trailer for Universal Pictures' 2003 film American Wedding. ==References== ==External links== * * [ Song Review] from AllMusic Category:1974 songs Category:1974 singles Category:2005 singles Category:Barry White songs Category:Songs written by Barry White Category:Disco songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Spain Category:UK Singles Chart number- one singles Category:20th Century Fox Records singles Category:Charity singles ",
