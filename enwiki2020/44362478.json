She was the recipient of the AWP Award for Creative Nonfiction (2003), and the Lillie Chaffin Award for Appalachian Writing (2001). ==Personal life== Karen Salyer McElmurray grew up in eastern Kentucky with a difficult childhood. Her mother suffered depression, and McElmurray moved around between a few new towns as her father tried to settle into a new job with the state education department. During her summers, she spent time with her paternal grandmother, and shared a love of words with her childhood best friend. They wrote poems together, igniting McElmurray's love of writing. At fourteen, her parents separated and McElmurray stayed with her father. Two years later, she became pregnant and gained all the life experience necessary for her to later pen her book Surrendered Child: A Birth Mother\u2019s Journey, her award-winning memoir about the birth and closed-adoption of her son. == Education == * Ph.D. in American Literature from the University of Georgia in 1997 * M.A. in English/Writing from Hollins University in 1989 * MFA in Fiction from the University of Virginia in 1986 * B.A. in Philosophy and Literature from Berea College in 1980 == Professional and teaching experience == McElmurray has served at numerous colleges and universities as an instructor, professor, and writer-in-residence.
