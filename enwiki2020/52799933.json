Mayes' vision was \"I see a 350 bed hospital as our goal, covering all major specialties, with excellent diagnostic facilities and operating theatres\". He served as chairman of the board of governors of the hospital for many years. The hospital had an annual fundraising Scottish fair at Brisbane City Hall each year for which Mayes cooked haggis. == Later life == Although born in Australia, Mayes had a strong affinity for his father's homeland of Scotland. At his death on 8 February 1893, Mayes was the chairman of the Queensland branch of the Society of St Andrew and had served for many years as president of the Caledonian Society. Pixie Annat, matron and CEO of St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital remembers: > \"Dr Mayes was a man of great vision and courage, generous of spirit and a > Scot to his bootstrap. He visited the hospital every day to see patients and > any staff who were sick. During the week he wore a dark suit and bow tie, > and at weekends, a sports jacket and trousers and a long Society of St > Andrew of Scotland tie. At formal occasions, he naturally wore his kilt and > dinner jacket.\" ==See also== * List of New South Wales representative cricketers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1901 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Queensland cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Toowoomba Category:Australian military personnel of World War II ",
