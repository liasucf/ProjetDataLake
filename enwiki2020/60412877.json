    "text": "HIDEA syndrome is a syndrome characterised by hypotonia, intellectual disability and eye abnormalities.Kaasinen E, Rahikkala E, Koivunen P, Miettinen S, Wamelink MM, Aavikko M, Palin K, Myllyharju J, Moilanen JS, Pajunen L, Karhu A, Aaltonen LA (2019) Clinical characterization, genetic mapping and whole-genome sequence analysis of a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome. Eur J Med Genet 57(10):543-551 ==Presentation== This syndrome main causes intellectual disability and affects the eyes, musculoskeletal system and face. Eyes *Strabismus *Difficulty fixing the eyes on an object Face Facial features gradually become coarser during childhood Musculoskeletal system * Hypotonia * Planovalgus * Contractures in elbow joints * Interphalangeal joint hypermobility Other associated features include hypoventilation, obstructive and central sleep apnea and dysautonomia. ==Genetics== This condition is caused by mutations in the Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, transmembrane (P4HTM) gene. This gene is located on the short arm arm of chromosome 3 (3p21.3). The inheritance of this condition is autosomal recessive. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis may be suspected on clinical grounds. It is made by sequencing the P4HTM gene. ==Management== There is presently no curative treatment. Management is supportive. ==Epidemiology== The prevalence is not known but this is considered to be a rare disease. Only 12 patients have been reported to date. ==History== This condition was first described in 2014.Kaasinen E, Rahikkala E, Koivunen P, Miettinen S, Wamelink MM, Aavikko M, Palin K, Myllyharju J, Moilanen JS, Pajunen L, Karhu A, Aaltonen LA (2019) Clinical characterization, genetic mapping and whole-genome sequence analysis of a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome. Eur J Med Genet 57(10):543-551 The causative mutation was discovered in 2019.Rahikkala E, Myllykoski M, Hinttala R, Vieira P, Nayebzadeh N, Weiss S, Plomp A, Bittner RE, Kurki MI, Kuismin O, Lewis AM, V\u00e4is\u00e4nen ML, Kokkonen H, Westermann J, Bernert G, Tuominen H, Palotie A, Aaltonen L, Yang Y, Potocki L, Moilanen J, van Koningsbruggen S, Wang X, Schmidt WM, Koivunen P, Uusimaa J (2019) Biallelic loss-of-function P4HTM gene variants cause hypotonia, hypoventilation, intellectual disability, dysautonomia, epilepsy, and eye abnormalities (HIDEA syndrome).
