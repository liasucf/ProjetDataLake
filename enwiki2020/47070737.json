    "text": "Zetapapillomavirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Papillomaviridae. Horses serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species Zetapapillomavirus 1. Diseases associated with this genus include: cutaneous lesions. ==Taxonomy== Group: dsDNA ==Structure== Viruses in Zetapapillomavirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=7 symmetry. The diameter is around 52-55 nm. Genomes are circular, around 7kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral proteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear envelope breakdown. Horses serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are contact. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !! Entry details !! Release details !! Replication site !!
