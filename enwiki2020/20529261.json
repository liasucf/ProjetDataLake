The village is located 150.9 km from Sofia. ==Geography== Chamla is formally the highest village in Bulgaria, even though it is abandoned\u2014this is because the land, administratively speaking, is still considered a village, although there have not been people there for many years. It is located close to the village Mugla and a rock formation known as the Trigrad Gorge. ==History== From 1878 to 1886, Chamla was located in the so-called Tamrash Republic. In 1920, 87 people lived in the village, in 1946, 133, and in 1965, 162. It was entirely deserted in the 80s, but it has not been removed from the lists of several associations. In 2004, the Frenchman Olivier Lieuk (?) attempted to become the only resident of the village, but stayed there for less than a year, living in primitive conditions. After him, Oscar Korea tried again at this task, but did not succeed. ==References== Category:Villages in Smolyan Province ",
