    "text": "Coprolite Street is a street in Ipswich, Suffolk in the Waterfront area. It runs from Duke Street to Neptune Marina, the former Orwell Quay. It was named after the factory which processed coprolite, or fossilised dinosaur dung, by Ipswich Docks. This factory was established by Edward Packard on the site of a former mill. It is believed by local people to be the only Coprolite Street in the country or even the world, and attracts geologists in particular who like to have their photograph taken by the street sign. ==References== Category:Streets in England Category:Ipswich ",
