High quality residential and retail developments that the German school attracted are present in the \u014cmori-sann\u014d area. \u014cmori is home to the headquarters of the automotive company Isuzu, which has offices in the Belport complex a few hundred metres from \u014cmori station. Prior to its development as a convenient residential and business location, \u014cmori was laced with a network of small rivers which were used by many locals for drying harvested nori (seaweed), a staple of the Japanese diet. Modern \u014cmori is built on mostly reclaimed land, and is very much a traditional Shinto area; there are many shrines in the area, and during the August o-bon festival, mikoshi parades are very common. \u014cmori-sann\u014d, to the west of \u014cmori station, is an upscale neighbourhood compared to the other side of the tracks, and \u014cmori- sann\u014d is known to be traditionally an area where Japanese poets, philosophers and writers have made their home. == World War II POW Camp == \u014cmori was the site of an Imperial Japanese Army-administered prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. The inhumane conditions in the camp were described in detail in the award winning book Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption describing the life of American Olympic Athlete Louis Zamperini. The camp was brutal and included in its staff known war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. However, US Navy submarine commander Richard O'Kane found Omori camp harsh, but essentially correct in administration, particularly compared with the \u014cfuna Imperial Japanese Navy detention centre. Local anti- militarist Japanese civilians sometimes helped the prisoners with small gifts of food.O'Kane, Richard H. Clear the Bridge! The War Patrols of the USS Tang London Macdonald & Jane's 1978 pp465-6 == Two Omoris == \u014cmori has two meanings: # Area around JR \u014cmori station. # Town of \u014cmori. While \u014cmori station opened in 1876 and is widely known to outsiders, the \"town of \u014cmori\" was renamed in 1970 and is less known, and even local residents are often confused. Broadly, the west side of JR \u014cmori station is still \u014cmori but generally speaking it is considered Sann\u014d area, an uptown. == Education == Omori High School Ota operates the public elementary and junior high schools in \u014cmori. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education operates \u014cmori High School Private high schools include Tokyo High School. == Parks == * Heiwa-no- mori Park.
