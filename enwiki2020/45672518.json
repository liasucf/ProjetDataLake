The Bishops' Conference of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church appointed him on 20 August 1986 successor of Denys Gaith as Archbishop of Homs. The Patriarch of Antioch Maximos V Hakim ordained him bishop on October 26, 1986. As co- consecrators assisted the Patriarch Hakim the Archbishops Habib Bacha, SMSP and Andr\u00e9 Haddad, BS. During his tenure Nehm\u00e9 was co-consecrator of the archbishops Antoine Hayek, BC, Georges El-Murr, BC and Bishop Jean-Abdo Arbach, BC. In 2006 Archbishop Nehm\u00e9 after his retirement became emeritus archbishop, and was succeeded by Isidore Battikha. ==About married priests== In 2001 Nehm\u00e9 declared in an interview, \"that the priests had four to nine children in his diocese on average and therefore were not less zealous in its missionary and apostolic work than their unmarried brothers\". In another line of thought, he raises the question of whether the \"success could not inspire the West with the married Catholic priests in the Orient?\" And he gives an answer to this question: \"But this development will not proceed stormy, may we have waiting for a third Vatican Council.\" ==References== ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20120419194326/http://www.pgc- lb.org/english/Church3.shtml#Homs * http://www.catholic- hierarchy.org/bishop/bnehme.html Category:1927 births Category:Melkite Greek Catholic bishops Category:Syrian archbishops Category:Living people ",
