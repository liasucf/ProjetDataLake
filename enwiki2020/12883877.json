    "text": "The Puerto Rico Statehood Commission was a grassroots non-partisan organization dedicated to research and education on Puerto Rico statehood. Founded by then Rep. Jos\u00e9 Granados in 1981, the organization operated until 1986 and included among its leaders a wide array of prominent statehooders, such as attorney Zaida Hern\u00e1ndez, who subsequently served as House Speaker and is currently an appellate court judge, attorney N\u00e9lida Jim\u00e9nez Vel\u00e1zquez, also an appellate judge, then Senator Oreste Ramos, Jr., Sol Luis Descartes, a former Treasury Secretary under PDP Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, current Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock and attorney Luis D\u00e1vila Col\u00f3n, currently Puerto Rico's most prominent political analyst. Headquartered in a building near Puerto Rico's Capitol Building, the organization graduated over 8,000 statehooders from every municipality in Puerto Rico who took a ten-week- long preparatory course on Puerto Rico statehood. Many of these graduates served as instructors in simultaneous neighborhood meetings that at times attracted over 60,000 attendees the same night. Jenniffer Gonzalez and Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 were active in the commission in 2016. ==References== Category:Politics of Puerto Rico Category:Political organizations based in Puerto Rico Category:History of Puerto Rico ",
