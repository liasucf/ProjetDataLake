She was previously the Minister for Social Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 2007 to 2010, when she was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Down. ==Political career== Lady Ritchie of Downpatrick is a graduate of The Queen's University of Belfast, and served as parliamentary assistant to Eddie McGrady, MP, from 1987 to 2003. Ritchie became a councillor on Down District Council in 1985 and was Vice-Chairman (1992\u201393) and Chairman of the Council (1993\u20131994). She has also served as International Secretary of the SDLP and as an alternate member of the European Committee of the Regions. She was nominated as the Social Development Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly by the SDLP which took effect on 8 May 2007.

On Remembrance Day 2010, Ritchie made history by becoming the first leader of an Irish nationalist party to wear a remembrance poppy. She wore it at the wreath- laying ceremony at the cenotaph in Downpatrick. In Northern Ireland, the wearing of poppies is controversial as it is seen by many as a political symbol representing support for the British Army. Because of this, it has long been the preserve of the unionist/loyalist community. She received praise from several unionist councillors for this.SDLP Leader Ritchie to wear Poppy BBC NewsDecision to wear poppy difficult for SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie Belfast TelegraphRitchie's Poppy Move 'Is a major breakthrough' The News Letter In December 2010 she launched a verbal attack on Sinn F\u00e9in by urging voters in the Republic of Ireland not to vote for Sinn F\u00e9in in the next Irish general election, describing their politics as 'sectarian' and causing 'division'.Ritchie warns voters over Sinn FeinBelfast Telegraph A Sinn F\u00e9in spokesperson described the comments as \"nonsense\" and \"an attempt to score cheap points\".http://www.louthleader.co.uk/news/ritchie_warns_voters_over_sinn_fein_1_2214179 In the 2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the SDLP lost two seats and saw its vote decline by 1%.
