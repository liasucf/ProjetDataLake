The Chinese as well as Korean and Japanese scribes regularly wrote it in reference to Yamato (ancient Japanese nation) with the Chinese character \"submissive, distant, dwarf\", until the 8th century, when the Japanese replaced it with \u548c \"harmony, peace, balance\". Damyeom-ripbon-wang-heedo (\u5510\u95bb\u7acb\u672c\u738b\u6703\u5716). 6th century, China. Envoys visiting the Tang Emperor. From left to right: Wa, Silla, Baekje ambassadors Wa tributaries 5-6th centuries AD == Historical references == The earliest textual references to Japan are in Chinese classic texts. Within the official Chinese dynastic Twenty-Four Histories, Japan is mentioned among the so-called Dongyi \u6771\u5937 \"Eastern Barbarians\". The historian Wang Zhenping summarizes Wo contacts with the Han State. > When chieftains of various Wo tribes contacted authorities at Lelang, a > Chinese commandery established in northern Korea in 108 B.C. by the Western > Han court, they sought to benefit themselves by initiating contact. In A.D. > 57, the first Wo ambassador arrived at the capital of the Eastern Han court > (25-220); the second came in 107. Wo diplomats, however, never called on > China on a regular basis. A chronology of Japan-China relations from the > first to the ninth centuries reveals this irregularity in the visits of > Japanese ambassadors to China. There were periods of frequent contacts as > well as of lengthy intervals between contacts. This irregularity clearly > indicated that, in its diplomacy with China, Japan set its own agenda and > acted on self-interest to satisfy its own needs. No Wo ambassador, for > example, came to China during the second century. This interval continued > well past the third century. Then within merely nine years, the female Wo > ruler Himiko sent four ambassadors to the Wei court (220-265) in 238, 243, > 245, and 247 respectively. After the death of Himiko, diplomatic contacts > with China slowed. Iyoo, the female successor to Himiko, contacted the Wei > court only once. The fourth century was another quiet period in China-Wo > relations except for the Wo delegation dispatched to the Western Jin court > (265-316) in 306. With the arrival of a Wo ambassador at the Eastern Jin > court (317-420) in 413, a new age of frequent diplomatic contacts with China > began. Over the next sixty years, ten Wo ambassadors called on the Southern > Song court (420-479), and a Wo delegation also visited the Southern Qi court > (479-502) in 479. The sixth century, however, saw only one Wo ambassador pay > respect to the Southern Liang court (502-557) in 502. When these ambassadors > arrived in China, they acquired official titles, bronze mirrors, and > military banners, which their masters could use to bolster their claims to > political supremacy, to build a military system, and to exert influence on > southern Korea. (Wang 2005:221-222) === Shan Hai Jing === The golden seal said to have been granted to the \"King of Wa\" by Emperor Guangwu of Han in 57 CE. Transcription of the seal. The seal reads \"\u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b\". Possibly the earliest record of W\u014d \u502d \"Japan\" occurs in the Shan Hai Jing \u5c71\u6d77\u7d93 \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\". The textual dating of this collection of geographic and mythological legends is uncertain, but estimates range from 300 BCE to 250 CE. The Haineibei jing \u6d77\u5167\u5317\u7d93 \"Classic of Regions within the North Seas\" chapter includes W\u014d \u502d \"Japan\" among foreign places both real, such as Korea, and legendary (e.g. Penglai Mountain). > Kai [cover] Land is south of Ch\u00fc Yen and north of Wo. Wo belongs to Yen. > [\u84cb\u570b\u5728\u9245\u71d5\u5357\u502d\u5317\u502d\u5c6c\u71d5 \u671d\u9bae\u5728\u5217\u967d\u6771\u6d77\u5317\u5c71\u5357\u5217\u967d\u5c6c\u71d5] Ch\u2019ao-hsien [Chos\u014fn, Korea] is east of Lieh > Yang, south of Hai Pei [sea north] Mountain. Lieh Yang belongs to Yen. (12, > tr. Nakagawa 2003:49) Nakagawa notes that Zhuyan \u9245\u71d5 refers to the (ca. 1000-222 BCE) kingdom of Yan (state), and that Wo (\"Japan was first known by this name.\") maintained a \"possible tributary relationship\" with Yan. === Lunheng === Wang Chong's ca. 70-80 CE Lunheng \u8ad6\u8861 \"Discourses weighed in the balance\" is a compendium of essays on subjects including philosophy, religion, and natural sciences. The R\u016dz\u0113ng \u5112\u5897 \"Exaggerations of the Literati\" chapter mentions W\u014dr\u00e9n \u502d\u4eba \"Japanese people\" and Yu\u00e8sh\u0101ng \u8d8a\u88f3 \"an old name for Champa\" presenting tributes during the Zhou Dynasty. In disputing legends that ancient Zhou bronze ding tripods had magic powers to ward off evil spirits, Wang says. > During the Chou time there was universal peace. The Yu\u00e8sh\u0101ng offered white > pheasants to the court, the Japanese odoriferous plants. [\u737b\u767d\u96c9\u502d\u4eba\u8ca2\u9b2f\u8349] Since by > eating these white pheasants or odoriferous plants one cannot keep free from > evil influences, why should vessels like bronze tripods have such a power? > (26, tr. Forke 1907:505) Another Lunheng chapter Huiguo \u6062\u570b \"Restoring the nation\" similarly records that Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 51-7 BCE) was presented tributes of Vietnamese pheasants and Japanese herbs (58, tr. Forke 1907:208). === Han Shu === The ca. 82 CE Han Shu \u6f22\u66f8 \"Book of Han\"' covers the Former Han Dynasty (206 BCE-24 CE) period. Near the conclusion of the Yan entry in the Dilizhi \u5730\u7406\u5fd7 \"Treatise on geography\" section, it records that Wo encompassed over 100 gu\u00f3 \u570b \"communities, nations, countries\". > Beyond Lo-lang in the sea, there are the people of Wo. They comprise more > than one hundred communities. [\u6a02\u6d6a\u6d77\u4e2d\u6709\u502d\u4eba\u5206\u7232\u767e\u9918\u570b] It is reported that they have > maintained intercourse with China through tributaries and envoys. (28B, tr. > Otake Takeo \u5c0f\u7af9\u6b66\u592b, cited by Nakagawa 2003:50) Emperor Wu of Han established this Korean Lelang Commandery in 108 BCE. Historian Endymion Wilkinson (2000:726) says Wo \u502d \"dwarf\" was used originally in the Hanshu, \"probably to refer to the inhabitants of Kyushu and the Korean peninsula. Thereafter to the inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago.\" === Wei Zhi === Text of the Wei Zhi (ca. 297) The ca. 297 CE Wei Zhi \u9b4f\u5fd7 \"Records of Wei\", comprising the first of the San Guo Zhi \u4e09\u570b\u5fd7 \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", covers history of the Cao Wei kingdom (220-265 CE). The \u6771\u5937\u4f1d \"Encounters with Eastern Barbarians\" section describes the W\u014dr\u00e9n \u502d\u4eba \"Japanese\" based upon detailed reports from Chinese envoys to Japan. It contains the first records of Yamatai-koku, shamaness Queen Himiko, and other Japanese historical topics. > The people of Wa dwell in the middle of the ocean on the mountainous islands > southeast of [the prefecture] of Tai-fang. They formerly comprised more than > one hundred communities. During the Han dynasty, [Wa envoys] appeared at the > Court; today, thirty of their communities maintain intercourse [with us] > through envoys and scribes. [\u502d\u4eba\u5728\u5e2f\u65b9\u6771\u5357\u5927\u6d77\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u5c71\u7232\u570b\u9091\u820a\u767e\u9918\u570b\u6f22\u6642\u6709\u671d\u898b\u8005\u4eca\u4f7f\u65e9\u8b6f\u6240\u901a\u4e09\u5341\u570b] (tr. > Tsunoda 1951:8) This Wei Zhi context describes sailing from Korea to Wa and around the Japanese archipelago. For instance, > A hundred li to the south, one reaches the country of Nu [\u5974\u570b], the official > of which is called shimako, his assistant being termed hinumori. Here there > are more than twenty thousand households. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:0) Tsunoda (1951:5) suggests this ancient N\u00fagu\u00f3 \u5974\u570b (lit. \"slave country\"), Japanese Nakoku \u5974\u56fd, was located near present-day Hakata in Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Some 12,000 li to the south of Wa is G\u01d2un\u00fagu\u00f3 \u72d7\u5974\u570b (lit. \"dog slave country\"), Japanese Kunakoku, which is identified with the Kumaso tribe that lived around Higo and \u014csumi Provinces in southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Beyond that, > Over one thousand li to the east of the Queen's land, there are more > countries of the same race as the people of Wa. To the south, also there is > the island of the dwarfs [\u4f8f\u5112\u570b] where the people are three or four feet tall. > This is over four thousand li distant from the Queen's land. Then there is > the land of the naked men, as well of the black-teethed people. [\u88f8\u570b\u9ed2\u9f52\u570b] > These places can be reached by boat if one travels southeast for a year. > (tr. Tsunoda 1951:13) One Wei Zhi passage (tr. Tsunoda 1951:14) records that in 238 CE the Queen of Wa sent officials with tribute to the Wei emperor Cao Rui, who reciprocated with lavish gifts including a gold seal with the official title \"Queen of Wa Friendly to Wei\". Another passage relates Wa tattooing with legendary King Shao Kang of the Xia Dynasty. > Men great and small, all tattoo their faces and decorate their bodies with > designs. From olden times envoys who visited the Chinese Court called > themselves \"grandees\" [\u5927\u592b]. A son of the ruler Shao-k'ang of Hsia, when he > was enfeoffed as lord of K'uai-chi, cut his hair and decorated his body with > designs in order to avoid the attack of serpents and dragons. The Wa, who > are fond of diving into the water to get fish and shells, also decorated > their bodies in order to keep away large fish and waterfowl. Later, however, > the designs became merely ornamental. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:10) \"Grandees\" translates Chinese d\u00e0f\u016b \u5927\u592b (lit. \"great man\") \"senior official; statesman\" (cf. modern d\u00e0ifu \u5927\u592b \"physician; doctor\"), which mistranslates Japanese imperial taifu \u5927\u592b \"5th-rank courtier; head of administrative department; grand tutor\" (the Nihongi records that the envoy Imoko was a taifu). A tattooed Haniwa statue, 4th-6th century, Kamiyasaku Tomb, Fukushima Prefecture. A second Wei history, the ca. 239-265 CE Weil\u00fce \u9b4f\u7565 \"Brief account of the Wei dynasty\" is no longer extant, but some sections (including descriptions of the Roman Empire) are quoted in the 429 CE San Guo Zhi commentary by Pei Songzhi \u88f4\u677e\u4e4b. He quotes the Weil\u00fce that \"W\u014d people call themselves posterity of T\u00e0ib\u00f3\" (\u502d\u4eba\u81ea\u8b02\u592a\u4f2f\u4e4b\u5f8c). Taibo was the uncle of King Wen of Zhou, who ceded the throne to his nephew and founded the ancient state of Wu (585-473 BCE). The Records of the Grand Historian has a section titled \u5433\u592a\u4f2f\u4e16\u5bb6 \"Wu Taibo's Noble Family\", and his shrine is located in present day Wuxi. Researchers have noted cultural similarities between the ancient Wu state and W\u014d Japan including ritual tooth-pulling, back child carriers, and tattooing (represented with red paint on Japanese Haniwa statues). === Hou Han Shu === The ca. 432 CE Hou Han Shu \u5f8c\u6f22\u66f8 \"Book of Later/Eastern Han\" covers the Later Han Dynasty (25-220 CE) period, but was not compiled until two centuries later. The W\u014dr\u00e9n \u502d\u4eba \"Japanese\" are included under the \u6771\u5937\u4f1d \"Encounters with Eastern Barbarians\" section. > The Wa dwell on mountainous islands southeast of Tai-fang in the middle of > the ocean, forming more than one hundred communities [\u502d\u4eba\u5728\u5e2f\u65b9\u6771\u5357\u5927\u6d77\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u5c71\u7232\u570b\u9091\u820a\u767e\u9918\u570b]. > From the time of the overthrow of Chao-hsien [northern Korea] by Emperor Wu > (B.C. 140-87), nearly thirty of these communities have held intercourse with > the Han [dynasty] court by envoys or scribes. Each community has its king, > whose office is hereditary. The King of Great Wa resides in the country of > Yamadai [\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd]. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:1) Comparing the opening descriptions of Wa in the Wei Zhi and Hou Han Shu clearly reveals that the latter is derivative. Their respective accounts of the dwarf, naked, and black-teethed peoples provide another example of copying. > Leaving the queen's land and crossing the sea to the east, after a voyage of > one thousand li, the country of Kunu [\u72d7\u5974\u570b] is reached, the people of which > are of the same race as that of the Wa. They are not the queen's subjects, > however. Four thousand li away to the south of the queen's land, the dwarf's > country [\u4f8f\u5112\u570b] is reached; its inhabitants are three to four feet in height. > After a year's voyage by ship to the southeast of the dwarf's country, one > comes to the land of naked men and also to the country of black-teethed > people [\u88f8\u570b\u9ed1\u9f52\u570b]; here our communication service ends. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:3) This Hou Han Shu account of Japan contains some historical details not found in the Wei Zhi. > In \u2026 [57 CE], the Wa country Nu [\u502d\u5974\u570b] sent an envoy with tribute who called > himself ta-fu [\u5927\u592b]. This country is located in the southern extremity of the > Wa country. Kuang-wu bestowed on him a seal. In \u2026 [107 CE], during the reign > of An-ti (107-125), the King of Wa presented one hundred sixty slaves, > making at the same time a request for an imperial audience. (tr. Tsunoda > 1951:2) Tsunoda (1951:5) notes support for the Hakata location of Nu/Na country in the 1784 discovery at Hakata Bay of a gold seal bearing the inscription \u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b, usually translated \"Han [vassal?] King of the Wa country Nu.\" Although the name of the King of Wa in AD 107 does not appear in the above translation, his name is Suish\u014d (\u5e25\u5347) according to the original text. === Song Shu === The 488 CE Song Shu \u5b8b\u66f8 \"Book of Song\" covers the brief history of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479). Under the \"Eastern and Southern Barbarians\" \u5937\u883b section, Japan is called W\u014dgu\u00f3 \u502d\u570b, Japanese Wakoku, and said to be located off Goguryeo. In contrast with the earlier histories that describe the Wa as a \u4eba \"people\", this Song history describes them as a \u570b \"country\". > The country of Wa is in the midst of the great ocean, southeast of Kogury\u014f. > From generation to generation, [the Wa people] carry out their duty of > bringing tribute. [\u502d\u570b\u5728\u9ad8\u9a6a\u6771\u5357\u5927\u6d77\u4e2d\u4e16\u4fee\u8ca2\u8077] In \u2026 [421], the first Emperor said in a > rescript: \"Ts'an [\u8b9a, Emperor Nintoku (r. ca. 313-319)] of Wa sends tribute > from a distance of tens of thousands of li. The fact that he is loyal, > though so far away, deserves appreciation. Let him, therefore, be granted > rank and title.\" \u2026 When Ts'an died and his brother, Chen [\u73cd, Emperor Hanzei > (r. ca. 406-411)], came to the throne, the latter sent an envoy to the Court > with tribute. Signing himself as King of Wa and General Who Maintains Peace > in the East [\u5b89\u6771\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u502d\u738b] Commanding with Battle-Ax All Military Affairs in the > Six Countries of Wa, Paekche, Silla, Imna, Chin-han and Mok-han, he > presented a memorial requesting that his titles be formally confirmed. An > imperial edict confirmed his title of King of Wa and General Who Maintains > Peace in the East. \u2026 In the twentieth year [443], Sai [\u6fdf, Emperor Ingy\u014d (r. > ca. 412-453)], King of Wa, sent an envoy with tribute and was again > confirmed as King of Wa and General Who Maintains Peace. In the twenty- > eighth year [451], the additional title was granted of General Who Maintains > Peace in the East Commanding with Battle-Ax All Military Affairs in the Six > Countries of Wa, Silla, Imna, Kala, Chin-han and Mok-han. (99, tr. Tsunoda > 1951:22-23) The Song Shu gives detailed accounts of relations with Japan, indicating that the Wa kings valued their political legitimization from the Chinese emperors. === Liang Shu === The 635 CE Liang Shu \u6881\u66f8 \"Book of Liang\", which covers history of the Liang Dynasty (502-557), records the Buddhist monk Hui Shen's trip to Wa and the legendary Fusang. It refers to Japan as W\u014d \u502d (without \"people\" or \"country\" suffixation) under the Dongyi \"Eastern Barbarians\" section, and begins with the Taibo legend. > The Wa say of themselves that they are posterity of T\u00e0ib\u00f3. According to > custom, the people are all tattooed. Their territory is over 12,000 li from > Daifang. It is located approximately east of Kuaiji [on Hangzhou Bay], > though at an extremely great distance. [] Later texts repeat this myth of Japanese descent from Taibo. The 648 CE Jin Shu \u6649\u66f8 \"Book of Jin\" about the Jin Dynasty (265-420 CE) uses a different \"call\" verb, w\u00e8i \u8b02 \"say; call; name\" instead of y\u00fan \u4e91 \"say; speak; call\", \"They call themselves the posterity of T\u00e0ib\u00f3 [\u81ea\u8b02\u592a\u4f2f\u4e4b\u5f8c]\". The 1084 CE Chinese universal history Zizhi Tongjian \u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451 speculates, \"The present-day Japan is also said to be posterity of T\u00e0ib\u00f3 of Wu; perhaps when Wu was destroyed, [a member of] a collateral branch of the royal family disappeared at sea and became Wo.\" []. === Sui Shu === The 636 CE Sui Shu \u968b\u66f8 \"Book of Sui\" records the history of the Sui Dynasty (581-618) when China was reunified. W\u014dgu\u00f3/Wakoku is entered under \"Eastern Barbarians\", and said to be located off of Baekje and Silla (see Hogong), two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. > Wa-kuo is situated in the middle of the great ocean southeast of Paekche and > Silla, three thousand li away by water and land. The people dwell on > mountainous islands. [\u502d\u570b\u5728\u767e\u6fdf\u65b0\u7f85\u6771\u5357\u6c34\u9678\u4e09\u5343\u91cc\u65bc\u5927\u6d77\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u5c71\u5cf6\u800c\u5c45] During the Wei dynasty, over > thirty countries [of Wa-kuo], each of which boasted a king, held intercourse > with China. These barbarians do not know how to measure distance by li and > estimate it by days. Their domain is five months' journey from east to west, > and three months' from north to south; and the sea lies on all sides. The > land is high in the east and low in the west. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:28) In 607 CE, the Sui Shu records that \"King Tarishihoko\" (a mistake for Empress Suiko) sent an envoy, Buddhist monks, and tribute to Emperor Yang. Her official message is quoted using the word Ti\u0101nz\u01d0 \u5929\u5b50 \"Son of Heaven; Chinese Emperor\". > \"The Son of Heaven in the land where the sun rises addresses a letter to the > Son of Heaven in the land where the sun sets. We hope you are in good > health.\" When the Emperor saw this letter, he was displeased and told the > chief official of foreign affairs that this letter from the barbarians was > discourteous, and that such a letter should not again be brought to his > attention. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:32) In 608, the Emperor dispatched Pei Ching as envoy to Wa, and he returned with a Japanese delegation. The Japanese Nihongi (22, tr. Aston 1972 2:136-9) also records these imperial envoys of 607 and 608, but with a differing Sino- Japanese historical perspective. It records more details, such as naming the envoy Imoko Wono no Omi and translator Kuratsukuri no Fukuri, but not the offensive Chinese translation. According to the Nihongi, when Imoko returned from China, he apologized to Suiko for losing Yang's letter because Korean men \"searched me and took it from me.\" When the Empress received Pei, he presented a proclamation (tr. Aston 1972 2:137-8) contrasting Chinese Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec \u7687\u5e1d \"Emperor\" with W\u014dw\u00e1ng \u502d\u738b \"Wa King\", \"The Emperor [\u7687\u5e1d] greets the Sovereign of Wa [\u502d\u738b].\" According to the Nihongi, Suiko gave Pei a different version of the imperial letter, contrasting Japanese Tenn\u014d \u5929\u7687 \"Japanese Emperor\" and K\u014dtei \u7687\u5e1d \"Emperor\" (Chinese ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng and hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec) instead of using \"Son of Heaven\". > The Emperor [\u5929\u7687] of the East respectfully addresses the Emperor [\u7687\u5e1d] of the > West. Your Envoy, P'ei Shih-ch'ing, Official Entertainer of the Department > of foreign receptions, and his suite, having arrived here, my long-harbored > cares were dissolved. This last month of autumn is somewhat chilly. How is > Your Majesty? We trust well. We are in our usual health. (tr. Aston 1972 > 2:139) Aston quotes the 797 CE Shoku Nihongi history that this 607 Japanese mission to China first objected to writing Wa with the Chinese character \u502d. > \"Wono no Imoko, the Envoy who visited China, (proposed to) alter this term > into Nippon, but the Sui Emperor ignored his reasons and would not allow it. > The term Nippon was first used in the period \u2026 618-626.\" Another Chinese > authority gives 670 as the date when Nippon began to be officially used in > China. (1972 2:137-8) The island of \"Wa\" (, probably modern Ky\u016bsh\u016b) is depicted below the island of \"Country/State of Japan\" (, probably modern Honsh\u016b) and above the island of Greater Ry\u016bky\u016b () on the right-hand side of this 16th-century Chinese world map, the Sihai Huayi Zongtu. === Tang Shu === The custom of writing \"Japan\" as Wa \u502d ended during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907 CE). Japanese scribes coined the name Nihon or Nippon \u65e5\u672c circa 608\u2013645 and replaced Wa \u502d with a more flattering Wa \u548c \"harmony; peace\" around 756\u2013757 CE (Carr 1992:6-7). The linguistic change is recorded in two official Tang histories. The 945 CE Tang shu \"Book of Tang\" \u5510\u66f8 (199A) has the oldest Chinese reference to R\u00ecb\u011bn \u65e5\u672c. The \"Eastern Barbarian\" section lists both Wakoku \u502d\u56fd and Nipponkoku \u65e5\u672c\u56fd, giving three explanations: Nippon is an alternate name for Wa, or the Japanese disliked Wakoku because it was \"inelegant; coarse\" \u4e0d\u96c5, or Nippon was once a small part of the old Wakoku. The 1050 CE Xin Tang Shu \u65b0\u5510\u66f8 \"New Book of Tang\", which has a Riben \u65e5\u672c heading for Japan under the \"Eastern Barbarians\", gives more details. > Japan in former times was called Wa-nu. It is 14,000 li distant from our > capital, situated to the southeast of Silla in the middle of the ocean. It > is five months' journey to cross Japan from east to west, and a three-month > journey from south to north. [\u65e5\u672c\u53e4\u502d\u5974\u4e5f\u53bb\u4eac\u5e2b\u842c\u56db\u5343\u91cc\u76f4\u65b0\u7f85\u6771\u5357\u5728\u6d77\u4e2d\u5cf6\u800c\u5c45\u6771\u897f\u4e94\u6708\u884c\u5357\u5317\u4e09\u6708\u884c] (145, tr. > Tsunoda 1951:38) Regarding the change in autonyms, the Xin Tang Shu says. > In \u2026 670, an embassy came to the Court [from Japan] to offer congratulations > on the conquest of Kogury\u014f.

Tsunoda > 1951:40) Subsequent Chinese histories refer to Japan as R\u00ecb\u011bn \u65e5\u672c and only mention W\u014d \u502d as an old name. === Gwanggaeto Stele === The earliest Korean reference to Japanese Wa (Wae in Korean) is the 414 CE Gwanggaeto Stele that was erected to honor King Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo (r. 391-413 CE). This memorial stele, which has the oldest usage of Wak\u014d (\u502d\u5bc7, \"Japanese pirates\", Waegu in Korean), records Wa as a military ally of Baekje in their battles with Goguryeo and Silla. Some scholars interpret these references to mean not only \"Japanese\" but also \"Gaya peoples\" in the southern Korean Peninsula. For instance, Lee suggests, > If Kokuryo could not destroy Paekche itself, it wished for someone else to > do so. Thus, in another sense, the inscription may have been wishful > thinking. At any rate, Wae denoted both the southern Koreans and people who > lived on the southwest Japanese islands, the same Kaya people who had ruled > both regions in ancient times. Wae did not denote Japan alone, as was the > case later. (1997:34) \"It is generally thought that these Wae were from the archipelago,\" write Lewis and Sesay (2002:104), \"but we as yet have no conclusive evidence concerning their origins.\" ==The word Wa== The Japanese endonym Wa \u502d \"Japan\" derives from the Chinese exonym W\u014d \u502d \"Japan, Japanese\", a graphic pejorative Chinese character that had some offensive connotation, possibly \"submissive, docile, obedient\", \"bowing; bent over\", or \"short person; dwarf\". === \u502d and \u548c characters === The Chinese character \u502d combines the \u4eba or \u4ebb \"human, person\" radical and a w\u011bi \u59d4 \"bend\" phonetic. This w\u011bi phonetic element depicts h\u00e9 \u79be \"grain\" over n\u01da \u5973 \"woman\", which Bernhard Karlgren (1923:368) semantically analyzes as: \"bend down, bent, tortuous, crooked; fall down, throw down, throw away, send away, reject; send out, delegate \u2013 to bend like a \u5973 woman working with the \u79be grain.\" The oldest written forms of \u502d are in Seal script, and it has not been identified in Bronzeware script or Oracle bone script. Most characters written with this w\u011bi \u59d4 phonetic are pronounced wei in Standard Chinese: *w\u00e8i \u9b4f (\"ghost\" radical) \"the state of Wei\" *w\u0113i \u9036 (\"motion\" radical) \"serpentine; winding, curving\" [in w\u0113iy\u00ed \u9036\u8fe4 \"winding (road, river)\"] *w\u011bi \u840e (\"plant\" radical) \"wilt; wither; atrophy; tire, grow weary; (metaphorically) decline, fade\" *w\u011bi \u75ff (\"sickness\" radical) \"paralysis; impotence\" *w\u011bi \u8ac9 (\"speech\" radical) \"shirk; shift blame (onto others)\" *w\u00e8i \u9927 (\"food\" radical) \"feed (animals)\" The unusual W\u014d \u502d \"Japan\" pronunciation of the w\u011bi \u59d4 phonetic element is also present in: *w\u014d \u8e12 (\"foot\" radical) \"strain; sprain (sinew or muscle)\" *w\u01d2 \u5a51 (\"woman\" radical) \"beautiful\" [in w\u01d2tu\u01d2 \u5a51\u5aa0 \"beautiful; pretty\"] A third pronunciation is found in the reading of the following character: *\u01cei \u77ee (\"arrow\" radical) \"dwarf, short of stature; low; inferior\" Nara period Japanese scholars believed that Chinese character for W\u014d \u502d \"Japan\", which they used to write \"Wa\" or \"Yamato\", was graphically pejorative in denoting \u59d4 \"bent down\" \u4ebb \"people\". Around 757 CE, Japan officially changed its endonym from Wa \u502d to Wa \u548c \"harmony; peace; sum; total\". This replacement Chinese character h\u00e9 \u548c combines a h\u00e9 \u79be \"grain\" phonetic (also seen in \u502d) and the \"mouth\" radical \u53e3. Carr explains: > Graphic replacement of the \u502d \"dwarf Japanese\" Chinese logograph became > inevitable. Not long after the Japanese began using \u502d to write Wa \u223c Yamato > 'Japan', they realized its 'dwarf; bent back' connotation. In a sense, they > had been tricked by Chinese logography; the only written name for 'Japan' > was deprecating. The chosen replacement wa \u548c 'harmony; peace' had the same > Japanese wa pronunciation as \u502d 'dwarf', and - most importantly - it was > semantically flattering. The notion that Japanese culture is based upon wa \u548c > 'harmony' has become an article of faith among Japanese and Japanologists. > (1992:6) In current Japanese usage, Wa \u502d \"old name for Japan\" is a variant Chinese character for Wa \u548c \"Japan\", excepting a few historical terms like the Five kings of Wa, wak\u014d (Chinese W\u014dk\u00f2u \u502d\u5bc7 \"Japanese pirates\"), and Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d dictionary. In marked contrast, Wa \u548c is a common adjective in Sino-Japanese compounds like Washoku \u548c\u98df \"Japanese cuisine\", Wafuku \u548c\u670d \"Japanese clothing\", Washitsu \u548c\u5ba4 \"Japanese-style room\", Waka \u548c\u6b4c \"Japanese-style poetry\", Washi \u548c\u7d19 \"traditional Japanese paper\", Wagyu \u548c\u725b \"Japanese cattle\". === Pronunciations === In Chinese, the character \u502d can be pronounced w\u0113i \"winding\", w\u01d2 \"an ancient hairstyle\", or W\u014d \"Japan\". The first two pronunciations are restricted to Classical Chinese bisyllabic words. W\u0113i \u502d occurs in w\u0113ich\u00ed \u502d\u9072 \"winding; sinuous; circuitous; meandering\", which has numerous variants including w\u0113iy\u00ed \u9036\u8fe4 and \u59d4\u86c7. The oldest recorded usage of \u502d is the Shi Jing (162) description of a w\u0113ich\u00ed \u502d\u9072 \"winding; serpentine; tortuous\" road; compare (18) using w\u0113itu\u00f3 \u59d4\u4f57 \"compliant; bending, pliable; graceful\". W\u01d2 \u502d occurs in w\u01d2du\u00f2j\u00ec \u502d\u58ae\u9afb \"a woman's hairstyle with a bun, popular during the Han Dynasty\". The third pronunciation W\u014d \u502d \"Japan; Japanese\" is more productive than the first two, as evident in Chinese names for \"Japanese\" things (e.g., W\u014dk\u00f2u \u502d\u5bc7 \"Japanese pirates\" above) or \"dwarf; pygmy\" animals. *w\u014dq\u012b \u502d\u6f06 \"Japanese lacquerware\" *w\u014dd\u0101o \u502d\u5200 \"Japanese sword\" *w\u014dgu\u0101 \u502d\u74dc (lit. \"Japanese melon\") \"pumpkin; squash\" *w\u014dh\u00e9m\u01ce \u502d\u6cb3\u99ac \"pygmy hippopotamus\" *w\u014dzh\u016b \u502d\u8c6c \"pygmy hog\" *w\u014dh\u00fah\u00f3u \u502d\u72d0\u7334 \"dwarf lemur\" *w\u014dheixingxing \u502d\u9ed1\u7329\u7329 \"pygmy chimpanzee\" Reconstructed pronunciations of w\u014d \u502d in Middle Chinese (ca. 6th-10th centuries CE) include \u02bcu\u00e2 (Bernhard Karlgren), \u02bcua (Zhou Fagao), and \u02bcwa (Edwin G. Pulleyblank). Reconstructions in Old Chinese (ca. 6th-3rd centuries BCE) include *\u02bcw\u00e2 (Karlgren), *\u02bcw\u0259r (Dong Tonghe), and *\u02bcw\u0259r (Zhou). In Japanese, the Chinese character \u502d has Sinitic on'yomi pronunciations of wa or ka from Chinese w\u014d \"Japan\" and w\u01d2 \"an ancient hairstyle\", or wi or i from w\u0113i \"winding; obedient\", and native kun'yomi pronunciations of yamato \"Japan\" or shitagau \"obey, obedient\". Chinese w\u014d \u502d \"an old name for Japan\" is a loanword in other East Asian languages including Korean \uc65c wae or wa, Cantonese wai1 or wo1, and Taiwanese Hokkien e2. === Etymology === Although the etymological origins of Wa remain uncertain, Chinese historical texts recorded an ancient people residing in the Japanese archipelago (perhaps Ky\u016bsh\u016b), named something like *\u02bcW\u00e2 or *\u02bcW\u0259r \u502d. Carr (1992:9-10) surveys prevalent proposals for Wa's etymology ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns waga \u6211\u304c \"my; our\" and ware \u6211 \"I; oneself; thou\") to shameful (writing Japanese Wa as \u502d implying \"dwarf barbarians\"), and summarizes interpretations for *\u02bcW\u00e2 \"Japanese\" into variations on two etymologies: \"behaviorally 'submissive' or physically 'short'.\" The first \"submissive; obedient\" explanation began with the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary. It defines \u502d as sh\u00f9nm\u00e0o \u9806\u7683 \"obedient/submissive/docile appearance\", graphically explains the \"person; human' radical with a w\u011bi \u59d4 \"bent\" phonetic, and quotes the above Shi Jing poem. According to the (1716) Kangxi Dictionary (\u502d\u53c8\u4eba\u540d \u9b6f\u5ba3\u516c\u540d\u502d), \u502d was the name of King Tuyen (\u9b6f\u5ba3\u516c) of Lu (Chinese: \u9b6f\u570b; pinyin: L\u01d4 Gu\u00f3, circa 1042\u2013249 BC). \"Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese,\" Carr (1992:9) suggests \"they transcribed Wa as *\u02bcW\u00e2 'bent back' signifying 'compliant' bowing/obeisance. Bowing is noted in early historical references to Japan.\" Examples include \"Respect is shown by squatting\" (Hou Han Shu, tr. Tsunoda 1951:2), and \"they either squat or kneel, with both hands on the ground. This is the way they show respect.\" (Wei Zhi, tr. Tsunoda 1951:13). Koji Nakayama (linked below) interprets w\u0113i \u9036 \"winding\" as \"very far away\" and euphemistically translates W\u014d \u502d as \"separated from the continent.\" The second etymology of w\u014d \u502d meaning \"dwarf; short person\" has possible cognates in \u01cei \u77ee \"short (of stature); midget, dwarf; low\", w\u014d \u8e12 \"strain; sprain; bent legs\", and w\u00f2 \u81e5 \"lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)\". Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a Zh\u016br\u00fagu\u00f3 \u4f8f\u5112\u570b \"pygmy/dwarf country\" located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as \"submissive people\" and the \"Country of Dwarfs\" legend as evidence that the \"little people\" etymology was a secondary development. Since early Chinese information about Wo/Wa peoples was based largely on hearsay, Wang Zhenping (2005:9) says, \"Little is certain about the Wo except they were obedient and complaisant.\" === Lexicography === An article by Michael Carr (1992:1) \"compares how Oriental and Occidental lexicographers have treated the fact that Japan's first written name was a Chinese W\u014d < *\u02bcW\u00e2 \u502d 'short/submissive people' insult.\" It evaluates 92 dictionary definitions of Chinese W\u014d \u502d to illustrate lexicographical problems with defining ethnically offensive words. This corpus of monolingual and bilingual Chinese dictionaries includes 29 Chinese-Chinese, 17 Chinese- English, 13 Chinese to other Western Languages, and 33 Chinese-Japanese dictionaries. To analyze how Chinese dictionaries deal with the belittling origins of W\u014d, Carr divides definitions into four types, abbreviated with Greek alphabet letters Alpha through Delta. *\u0391 = \"dwarf; Japanese\" *\u0392 = \"compliant; Japanese\" *\u0393 = \"derogatory Japanese\" *\u0394 = \"Japanese\" For example, Alpha (A) type includes both overt definitions like \"The land of dwarfs; Japan\" (Liushi Han-Ying cidian \u5289\u6c0f\u6f22\u82f1\u8fad\u5178 [Liu's Chinese-English Dictionary] 1978) and more sophisticated semantic distinctions like \"(1) A dwarf. (2) Formerly, used to refer to Japan\" (Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage 1972). Beta (B) \"compliant; Japanese\" is illustrated by \"dem\u00fctig [humble; submissive; meek], gehorchen [obey; respond]\" (Praktisches zeichenlexikon chinesisch-deutsch-japanisch [A Practical Chinese-German- Japanese Character Dictionary] 1983). Gamma (\u0393) \"type definitions such as \"depreciatingly Japanese\" (e.g., A Beginner's Chinese-English Dictionary of the National Language (Gwoyeu) 1964) include usage labels such as \"derogatory,\" \"disparaging,\" \"offensive,\" or \"contemptuous\". Some \u0393 notations are restricted to subentries like \"W\u014dn\u00fa \u502d\u5974 (in modern usage, derogatively) the Japs\" (Zuixin shiyong Han-Ying cidian \u6700\u65b0\u5be6\u7528\u548c\u82f1\u8fad\u5178 [A New Practical Chinese- English Dictionary] 1971). Delta (\u0394) \"Japanese\" is the least informative type of gloss; for instance, \"an old name for Japan\" (Xin Han-Ying cidian \u65b0\u6f22\u82f1\u8a5e\u5178 [A New Chinese-English Dictionary] 1979). Carr evaluates these four typologies for defining the Chinese \u502d \"bent people\" graphic pejoration. > From a theoretical standpoint, A \"dwarf\" or B \"submissive\" type definitions > are preferable for providing accurate etymological information, even though > it may be deemed offensive. It is no transgression for an abridged Chinese > dictionary to give a short \u0394 \"Japan\" definition, but adding \"an old name > for\" or \"archaic\" takes no more space than adding a \u0393 \"derogatory\" note. A \u0394 > definition avoids offending the Japanese, but misleads the dictionary user > in the same way as the OED2 defining wetback and white trash without usage > labels. (1992:12). The table below (Carr 1992:31, \"Table 8. Overall Comparison of Definitions\") summarizes how Chinese dictionaries define W\u014d \u502d. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Definition Type ! Chinese\u2013Chinese ! Chinese\u2013English ! Chinese\u2013Other ! Chinese\u2013Japanese |- | \u0391 \"dwarf; Japanese\" | 3 (10%) | 10 (59%) | 5 (38%) | 4 (12%) |- | \u0392 \"compliant; Japanese\" | 0 | 0 | 1 (8%) | 4 (12%) |- |\u0393 derogatory Japanese | 0 | 1 (6%) | 3 (23%) | 11 (33%) |- | \u0394 \"Japanese\" | 26 (90%) | 6 (35%) | 4 (31%) | 14 (42%) |- | Total Dictionaries | 29 | 17 | 13 | 33 |} Half of the Western language dictionaries note that Chinese W\u014d \u502d \"Japanese\" means \"little person; dwarf\", while most Chinese-Chinese definitions overlook the graphic slur with \u0394 type \"ancient name for Japan\" definitions. This demeaning A \"dwarf\" description is found more often in Occidental language dictionaries than in Oriental ones. The historically more accurate, and ethnically less insulting, \"subservient; compliant\" B type is limited to Chinese-Japanese and Chinese-German dictionaries. The \u0393 type \"derogatory\" notation occurs most often among Japanese and European language dictionaries. The least edifying \u0394 \"(old name for) Japan\" type definitions are found twice more often in Chinese- Chinese than in Chinese-Japanese dictionaries, and three times more than in Western ones. Even the modern-day Unicode universal character standard reflects inherent lexicographic problems with this ancient Chinese W\u014d \u502d \"Japan\" affront. The Unihan (Unified CJK characters) segment of Unicode largely draws definitions from two online dictionary projects, the Chinese CEDICT and Japanese EDICT. The former lists Chinese wo1 \u502d \"Japanese; dwarf\", wokou4 \u502d\u5bc7 \"(in ancient usage) the dwarf-pirates; the Japs\", and wonu2 \u502d\u5974 \"(used in ancient times) the Japanese; (in modern usage, derogatively) the Japs\". The latter lists Japanese yamato \u502d \"ancient Japan\", wajin \u502d\u4eba \"(an old word for) a Japanese\", and wakou \u502d\u5bc7 \"Japanese pirates.\" == References == *Aston, William G. 1924.
