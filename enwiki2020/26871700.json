    "text": "SIBUR (PJSC SIBUR Holding) is a Russian petrochemicals company founded in 1995 and headquartered in Moscow. SIBUR operates production sites located all over Russia, has over 1,400 major customers engaged in the energy, automotive, construction, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), chemical and other industries in approximately 70 countries worldwide and employs around 26,000 personnel. In 2018, its revenue was USD 9.1 bln and EBITDA USD 3.2 bln. == History == SIBUR was founded by government decree in 1995. 38% of its shares were state owned and the remaining 62% of the company was made public. Towards the end of 1998, SIBUR started its transformation into a vertically integrated petrochemical holding with a full production chain from the processing of raw materials through to the manufacture of finished goods. Michael Cherney, its controlling shareholder at the time, invested over $110 million in SIBUR\u2019s business development and expansion programme. SIBUR subsequently built up assets by buying stakes in petrochemical companies all over Russia, including some 60 companies. By 2001, Gazprom had acquired control of SIBUR with a 51% stake. In 2003, Alexander Dyukov was appointed president and oversaw a reform with a long-term growth strategy and implementation of infrastructure updates. By September, the stock was divided between Gazprom (25%) and Gazprombank (75%). Dyukov was succeeded by Dmitry Konov as SIBUR\u2019s new president towards the end of 2006. In July 2005, SIBUR founded AKS Holding (whose legal successor is today's SIBUR) to clean up the holding's debts of RUB 60 bn, with most of this amount due to the parent company. The balance sheet of AKS Holding received the shares of 26 petrochemical businesses held by SIBUR. In December 2005, AKS Holding was renamed SIBUR Holding. In 2008, Gazprom decided that the petrochemical business was a non-core asset, and SIBUR shares were sold to Gazfond in exchange for its energy assets. Both Gazprombank and Gazfond also withdrew from the Gazprom group. In December 2010, Gazprombank began a phased sale of SIBUR to Leonid Mikhelson. In 2011, SIBUR began exiting its non-core production assets, including its tyre and mineral fertilizer businesses, which it sold. Instead, the company focused on investing in polymer investments. By 2020, SIBUR is planning to launch ZapSibNeftekhim on the basis of the Tobolsk Production Site which is to become Russia\u2019s largest petrochemical complex, permitting SIBUR to double polymer production. == Corporate affairs == === Ownership === By the autumn of 2011, 100% of SIBUR were owned by the company SIBUR Limited, which since 2013 is 82.5% owned by Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko.

In 2014 Timchenko's share was purchased by Kirill Shamalov, deputy chairman of SIBUR, increasing his share to 21.3%. As of 28 April 2017, ownership of SIBUR was divided as follows: Leonid Mikhelson \u2013 48.5%, Gennady Timchenko \u2013 17%, current and former managers of SIBUR Holding 14.5%, Sinopec 10%, Silk Road Fund 10%.
