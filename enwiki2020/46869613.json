    "text": "Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda is a Mexican photographer and photojournalist, whose work has been recognized with membership in the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana, and the Coatlicue Prize from the ComuArte, Mujeres en el Arte (Women in Art) organization. She was born Mar\u00eda del Carmen S\u00e1nchez Casta\u00f1eda in Irapuato, Guanajuato in 1936, but when she was six months old, her family moved to Mexico City where she grew up. As a child, she won a drawing contest with the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper, and received a camera as a prize. This was the beginning of her work as a photographer, documenting aspects of her life. Her parents separated when she was still young, and she had to work as well as study to help her family's finances. Her aunt owned a photography business, where one day she met photographer H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo. She married him not long after, when she was only eighteen years old. After five years of marriage, she began working with her husband as a darkroom assistant, developing rolls that H\u00e9ctor had shot. This prompted Mar\u00eda to take her photography more seriously, balancing the raising of her children, the work with her husband and her own photography projects, starting in 1965. Mar\u00eda began working freelance with a number of newspapers and magazines in Mexico and also became known for her photographic portraits of women such as Mother Theresa, Valentina Tereshkova and Nancy C\u00e1rdenas. In 1968, she collaborated with writer Elena Poniatowska, taking photos of the Olympics and students protests of that year. Mar\u00eda's first exhibition of her work was at the Casa del Lago (UNAM), and has since been featured in numerous individual and collective exhibitions in venues such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana. Her most noted artistic photos combine photography with graphic design, using light and the positioning of objects over others. Along with her husband, Mar\u00eda founded the Mar\u00eda y H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Foundation, located in Mexico City. The location conserved a collection of over 1.5 million images taken by the two. ==References== Category:Mexican photographers Category:Mexican women photographers Category:Mexican photojournalists Category:People from Irapuato Category:Artists from Guanajuato Category:1936 births Category:Living people ",
