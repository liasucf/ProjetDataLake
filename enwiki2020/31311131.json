However, most of the urban areas are concentrated around the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour areas where some of the country's most busy places are situated; Sliema, Saint Julian's, Paceville, Msida, G\u017cira, Ta' Xbiex and Piet\u00e0. As cars and road transport grew more and more popular in the country, the population started to spread out to farther areas and nowadays some other urban areas have developed; Saint Paul's Bay (including Qawra, Bu\u0121ibba and Xemxija) and Mellie\u0127a in the North, whilst having Marsaskala and the Malta Freeport area in the South of the country. Some of the tall buildings in Malta, such as the Metropolis Plaza in G\u017cira, are still under construction. The highest structure ever built in Malta was the Delimara Power Station chimney, standing above ground, until its demolition in 2017\u201318. == Tallest buildings in Malta == The list includes buildings (above ) in Malta. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
