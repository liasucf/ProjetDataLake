Her parents were born and raised in India. Her father's occupation as a physicist meant the family moved around the world living near universities. Her schooling took place mainly in India, but also in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. She received her medical degree with first class honours from Monash University. In 2004, she received the distinguished Fulbright Award, which she used to obtain a fellowship in medical ethics and doctor-patient communication at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago. Srivastava received a second Fulbright Award to undertake a Master in Public Administration (MPA) at Harvard University. She is also the recipient of a John F. Kennedy merit scholarship to Harvard University. ==Career== Srivastava works in the public healthcare system in Victoria. She says that her early experiences have drawn her to the care of migrants and refugees and improving conditions in areas of disadvantage. Her own experience of losing twins in utero has led her to a keen appreciation of the need for honesty and truth- telling in medicine. A regular contributor to the London newspaper,The Guardian, she has also written a number of books, including Tell Me the Truth, Dying for a Chat, So It's Cancer: Now What, and After Cancer: A Guide to Living Well. In Dying for a Chat, she writes that increased medical specialisation means that doctors can fail to see the whole picture, with risks for patients from a failure of communication. Srivastava is a frequent co-host on The Conversation Hour, a flagship radio program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Melbourne. She has also developed a podcast series on health and wellbeing for ABC Radio National. These podcasts include: \"The Ripple Effect of Cancer\" and \"An Illness in the Family\".
