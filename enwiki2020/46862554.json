The controversy was picked up by CNBC, Business Insider, and the New York Times Bits blog. Michael Wolff, the journalist who had arranged for and invited Smith to the private dinner where the controversial remarks were made, wrote a lengthy piece about the controversy, stating that Uber executives had believed that the event was off-the-record, but that he (Wolff) had failed to communicate the information to Smith. |- |2014|| October 29 ||International expansion |Uber expands its operations in Canada by launching UberX in Montreal.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/uberx-illegal-says- montreal-mayor-denis-coderre-1.2816707/ |- | 2014 || December 4 || Funding || Uber confirms it has raised $1.2 billion at a $40 billion pre-money valuation in a Series E round.

The move is prompted by the observation that UberPool users, who do see the ride price upfront, are more likely to continue using the service. Price changes triggered by destination changes will be sent to riders in real time. Changes to routes due to traffic or other reasons not under the rider's control will not result in a change to the price charged upfront. The move is not an end to surge pricing but rather a change in the way the surge pricing is communicated to customers. The change, officially announced in late June, had already been rolled out at the time of announcement in several cities, and had received some commentary in May. |- | 2016 || June 9 || Product || Uber opens up the Uber RUSH API to developers.

The cars are modified version of the Volvo sports utility vehicle equipped with Uber's technology for self-driving. Cars will have drivers at the wheel, monitoring the vehicle, as required by law.
