In June 2015, New Zealand Cricket were in talks with Cricket Australia to have a tour consisting of two Tests and three One Day Internationals (ODIs). In August 2015, the fixtures were announced which contained the reduction of Tests from three to two and the addition of the three ODIs. In December 2015 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum announced that he would be retiring from all forms of international cricket at the conclusion of the series. New Zealand won the ODI series 2\u20131 to retain the Chappell\u2013Hadlee Trophy. McCullum finished his ODI career with the best win-loss ratio of any New Zealander who has captained in ten or more matches. In his final match, McCullum broke the record for the fastest century scored in Test cricket. Australia won the Test series 2\u20130, to retain the Trans-Tasman Trophy and regain the number one position in the ICC Test Championship. Adam Voges, who hit the winning runs, finished the Test series with a batting average of 95.50. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0 auto\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Brendon McCullum (c) * Corey Anderson * Doug Bracewell * Trent Boult * Mark Craig * Martin Guptill * Matt Henry * Tom Latham * Henry Nicholls * Mitchell Santner * Tim Southee * Neil Wagner * BJ Watling (wk) * Kane Williamson | * Steve Smith (c) * David Warner (vc) * Jackson Bird * Joe Burns * Josh Hazlewood * Usman Khawaja * Nathan Lyon * Mitchell Marsh * Shaun Marsh * Peter Nevill (wk) * James Pattinson * Chadd Sayers * ~~Peter Siddle~~ * Adam Voges | * Brendon McCullum (c) * Corey Anderson * Trent Boult * Doug Bracewell * Grant Elliott * Martin Guptill * Matt Henry * Adam Milne * Colin Munro * Henry Nicholls * Luke Ronchi (wk) * Mitchell Santner * Kane Williamson | * Steve Smith (c) * David Warner (vc) * George Bailey * Scott Boland * ~~James Faulkner~~ * John Hastings * Josh Hazlewood * Usman Khawaja * Mitchell Marsh * Shaun Marsh * Glenn Maxwell * Joel Paris * ~~Kane Richardson~~ * Marcus Stoinis * Matthew Wade (wk) * Adam Zampa |} James Faulkner was ruled out of Australia's squad after suffering a hamstring injury in the first ODI.
