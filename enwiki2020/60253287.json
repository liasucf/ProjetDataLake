    "text": "The Original Series logo Star Trek is an American media franchise based on the science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. The first television series, simply called Star Trek and now referred to as \"The Original Series\", debuted in 1966 and aired for three seasons on NBC. The Star Trek canon includes The Original Series, seven spin-off television series, two animated series, and thirteen films. == Television series == Nine television series and one short-form companion series make up the bulk of the Star Trek franchise: The Original Series, The Animated Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise, Discovery, Short Treks, Picard and Lower Decks, along with multiple upcoming series which include Prodigy and Strange New Worlds. All series in total amount to episodes across seasons of television. ===The Original Series (1966\u20131969)=== Star Trek, more commonly known as Star Trek: The Original Series, often abbreviated as TOS, debuted in the United States on NBC on September 8, 1966. The series tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five-year mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\" The original 1966\u201369 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy, James Doohan as Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov. During the series' original run, it earned several nominations for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and won twice: for the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\", and the Harlan Ellison-written episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". NBC canceled the series after three seasons; the last original episode aired on June 3, 1969. A petition near the end of the second season to save the series signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings, it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students. The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following. In the 2000s, the series was remastered for television, which included special-effect changes including CGI versions of the ships. ===The Animated Series (1973\u20131974)=== Star Trek, later marketed as Star Trek: The Animated Series (TAS) to differentiate it from the live-action series, was produced by Filmation, and ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974. Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from The Original Series, and some of the writers who worked on The Original Series returned, including D. C. Fontana, David Gerrold and Paul Schneider. While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms, animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series' reputation. Although it was originally sanctioned by Paramount, which owned the Star Trek franchise following its acquisition of Desilu in 1967, Gene Roddenberry often spoke of TAS as non-canon. , it has references in the library section of the official Star Trek website. The Animated Series won Star Treks first Emmy Award on May 15, 1975. The Animated Series briefly returned to television in the mid-1980s on the children's cable network Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994; in the early 1990s, the Sci-Fi Channel also began rerunning TAS. The complete series was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s. The complete series was first released in the United States on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989. All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006. ===The Next Generation (1987\u20131994)=== Star Trek: The Next Generation, frequently abbreviated as TNG, takes place about a century after The Original Series (2364\u20132370). It features a new starship, Enterprise-D, and a new crew led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes). Some crew members represent new alien races, including Deanna Troi, a half-Betazoid counselor played by Marina Sirtis. Michael Dorn plays Worf, the first Klingon officer in Starfleet, alongside Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, LeVar Burton as chief engineer Geordi La Forge, the android Data portrayed by Brent Spiner, and Dr. Crusher's son Wesley Crusher played by Wil Wheaton. The series premiered on September 28, 1987 and ran for seven seasons, ending on May 23, 1994. It had the highest ratings of any of the Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last few years of its original run, allowing it to act as a springboard for ideas in other series. Many relationships and races introduced in TNG became the basis of episodes in Deep Space Nine and Voyager. During its run it earned several Emmy Awards and nominations\u2014including a nomination for Best Dramatic Series during its final season\u2014two Hugo Awards and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for the episode \"The Big Goodbye\". The series was released in high definition on Blu-Ray and Netflix with some special effect changes in the 2010s. ===Deep Space Nine (1993\u20131999)=== Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, frequently abbreviated as DS9, takes place during the last years and the immediate post-years of The Next Generation (2369\u20132375) and aired for seven seasons, from January 3, 1993 to June 2, 1999. Like The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine aired in syndication in the United States and Canada. Unlike the other Star Trek series, DS9 takes place primarily on a space station rather than aboard a starship. The series begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian-built space station, Deep Space Nine, near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the series discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station one of the most strategically important locations in the galaxy. The series chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) Benjamin Sisko, played by Avery Brooks, and Major (later Colonel) Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor. Recurring plot elements include the repercussions of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets, and in later seasons a war with the Dominion. Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, conflict within the crew, and religious themes\u2014all elements that critics and audiences praised but Roddenberry forbade in the original series and The Next Generation. ===Voyager (1995\u20132001)=== Star Trek: Voyager ran for seven seasons, airing from January 16, 1995, to May 23, 2001, launching a new Paramount-owned television network, UPN. It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway, the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a Star Trek series, and Commander Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran. Voyager takes place at about the same time period as Deep Space Nine and the years following that series' end (2371\u20132378). The premiere episode has the USS Voyager and its crew pursue a Maquis (Federation rebels) ship. Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light-years from Earth. Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth, the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage. Like Deep Space Nine, early seasons of Voyager feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arises from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together on Voyager. Eventually, though, they settle their differences, after which the overall tone becomes more reminiscent of The Original Series. Isolated from its home, the starship Voyager faces new cultures and dilemmas not possible in other series based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior series, such as the Borg, Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and cast members of The Next Generation. ===Enterprise (2001\u20132005)=== Star Trek: Enterprise, originally titled Enterprise, is a prequel to the original Star Trek series. It aired from September 26, 2001 to May 13, 2005. Enterprise takes place in the 2150s, some 90 years after the events of Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight and about a decade before the founding of the Federation. The series centers on the voyages of Earth's first warp 5 capable starship, Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula), and the Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol (played by Jolene Blalock). The series originally did not include \"Star Trek\" in its name and logo, adding it later on in the series' run. During the series' first two seasons, Enterprise featured self-contained episodes, like The Original Series, The Next Generation and Voyager. The entire third season consisted of one arc related to the Xindi, and had a darker tone and serialized nature similar to that of Deep Space Nine. The fourth and final season consisted of several mini-arcs composed of two to three episodes. The final season showed the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some of their continuity problems. Ratings for Enterprise started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast criticized the series finale, partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of cast members of The Next Generation. The cancellation of Enterprise ended an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek television series, which began with The Next Generation in 1987. ===Discovery (2017\u2013present)=== Star Trek: Discovery is a direct prequel to The Original Series, set roughly ten years prior. It premiered September 24, 2017 in the United States and Canada on CBS before moving to CBS All Access, while Netflix streams the series outside the United States and is also providing most of the series' funding. The series centers on the voyages of the USS Discovery, a unique starship with an experimental \"spore drive\", commanded in Season 1 by Captain Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs), and in Season 2 by Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount), on temporary assignment during a refit of the Enterprise. Lieutenant Commander Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green), is the lead character of the series. This marks the first Star Trek series to feature a First Officer as the lead. The series opens with the Klingon T'Kuvma attempting to unite the 24 great Klingon houses, leading to a war between his race and the United Federation of Planets that involves the crew of the Discovery. ===Short Treks (2018\u2013present)=== Star Trek: Short Treks is a spin-off companion series of stand-alone short films which focus on characters and situations from Discovery. Some of the episodes are animated. ===Picard (2020\u2013present)=== Star Trek: Picard is the eighth series in the franchise that is set 20 years after the end of Nemesis. Jonathan Frakes, who has directed episodes of multiple Trek series, directs two episodes of the first season. The series premiered on January 23, 2020. ===Lower Decks (2020\u2013present)=== Star Trek: Lower Decks was announced on October 25, 2018, by CBS All Access as a two-season order for a half-hour adult animated comedy series created by Mike McMahan, the head writer and executive producer of Rick and Morty. It focuses on the support crew of \"one of Starfleet's least important ships\", and shares a name with a Next Generation episode. The first season premiered on August 6, 2020, and will consist of 10 episodes. ===Future television series=== An animated and two live-action television series are currently in development. ====Prodigy==== In February 2019, it was announced that an animated series developed for young viewers was in development. The series is being co-written and created by Dan and Kevin Hageman and will air on Nickelodeon as a joint-venture with CBS. It focuses on a group of teens who embark on an adventure upon an abandoned Starfleet ship. On July 23, 2020, it was announced that the title would be Star Trek: Prodigy and that it will premiere in 2021. ====Strange New Worlds==== Announced in May 2020, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds will depict the early days of the Enterprise and feature Discovery actors Anson Mount, Ethan Peck and Rebecca Romijn reprising their roles as Pike, Spock and Number One, respectively. Creator Akiva Goldsman intends for the series to use an episodic format similar to The Original Series and The Next Generation. It will be released on CBS All Access. In June 2020, Jonathan Frakes confirmed he had been asked to return as a director for the series. ====Section 31==== Announced in January 2019, a live-action television series, currently untitled, will focus on the mirror universe's Philippa Georgiou and her adventures as a member of Starfleet's Section 31 division. Michelle Yeoh will reprise her role from Discovery, with Bo Yeon Kim and Erika Lippoldt serving as co-showrunners. The series is reported to feature an ensemble cast. ====Other series==== The expanded franchise also includes several series, including a planned series being developed by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz and set at Starfleet Academy, as well as Ceti Alpha V, a limited series based on the character Khan Noonien Singh and his The Wrath of Khan storyline, written by Nicholas Meyer. ===Failed television series=== Star Trek has had television series that failed to make it to distribution. ====Phase II==== Star Trek: Phase II was a 1970s follow-up live-action television series to The Original Series. Though sets were constructed, scripts written, characters cast, and production started, the series was cancelled in favor of The Motion Picture, the first Star Trek feature film. The series would have anchored a fourth U.S. television network, the Paramount Network. This would later happen when Star Trek: Voyager anchored the launch of UPN, the United Paramount Network in the 1990s. ==Feature films== Paramount Pictures has produced thirteen Star Trek feature films, the most recent being released in July 2016.Bot generated title --> The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations was designed as a transition from that cast to the cast of the Next Generation series; the next three films, 8\u201310, focused completely on the cast of the Next Generation series. The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth films take place in an alternate timeline, officially known as the Kelvin Timeline, with a new cast playing younger versions of the original series characters and Leonard Nimoy portraying an elderly Spock. Three major attempts at continuing or reigniting the film franchise have been made, but so far have not continued for various reasons. ===The Original Series films=== Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry first suggested the idea of a Star Trek feature in 1969.Reeves-Stevens, 155\u2013158. When the original television series was canceled, he lobbied to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic screenplay, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Phase II. The massive worldwide box office success of Star Wars in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's Close Encounters of the Third Kind had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, and production of Phase II was cancelled in favor of making a Star Trek film. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\" !

The movie borrows many elements from \"The Changeling\" of the original series and \"One of Our Planets Is Missing\" from the animated series.

Douglas Trumbull was hired and given a blank check to complete the effects work in time and location;Sackett & Roddenberry, 204\u2013205. the final cut of the film was completed just in time for the film's premiere. The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for Phase II were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $45 million due to costly effects work and delays. ====Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)==== Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the Enterprise fifteen years earlier (\"Space Seed\"), seeks his revenge on the Admiral and lays a cunning and sinister trap. The Motion Pictures gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget. After Roddenberry pitched a film in which the crew of the Enterprise goes back in time to ensure the assassination of John F. Kennedy, he was \"kicked upstairs\" to a ceremonial role while Paramount brought in television producer Harve Bennett to craft a better\u2014and cheaper\u2014film than the first.Rioux, 240. After watching all the television episodes, Bennett decided that the character Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect villain for the new film. Director Nicholas Meyer finished a complete screenplay in just twelve days, and did everything possible within budget to give The Wrath of Khan a nautical, swashbuckling feel, which he described as \"Horatio Hornblower in outer space.\" Upon release, the reception of The Wrath of Khan was highly positive; Entertainment Weeklys Mark Bernadin called The Wrath of Khan \"the film that, by most accounts, saved Star Trek as we know it\". Both the first and second films have television versions with additional footage and alternate takes that affect the storyline. (Subsequent Star Trek films tended to have shorter television versions). Especially notable in The Wrath of Khan is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the Enterprise is Scotty's nephew. ====Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984)==== The plot picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous film. When McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his katra, his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the Enterprise and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a renegade Klingon (Christopher Lloyd) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences. Meyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member Leonard Nimoy. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened.Rioux, 251. The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \"Amok Time\". ====Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)==== While returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of humpback whales. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks) to care for them. Nimoy returned as director for this film. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a time travel story with the Enterprise crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their present\u2014eventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by Daniel Petrie Jr., Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story Time After Time for elements of the screenplay. Star William Shatner was promised his turn as director for Star Trek V, and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for Star Trek VI. ====Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989)==== Spock's half-brother (Laurence Luckinbill) believes he is summoned by God, and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) Enterprise-A to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the Milky Way, beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and arrogant Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk. This is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner. ====Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)==== When Qo'noS' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion, caused by over-mining, the catastrophe also contaminating Qo'noS' atmosphere, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. While on the way to Earth for a peace summit, the Klingon Chancellor (David Warner) is assassinated by Enterprise crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff (Christopher Plummer). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides. This film is a sendoff to the original series cast. One Next Generation cast member, Michael Dorn, appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series, Worf. It is the second and last Star Trek film directed by Nicholas Meyer and last screenplay co-authored by Leonard Nimoy. ===The Next Generation films=== Both the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the Next Generation cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and the seventh focusing on the TNG cast. The Next Generation cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (Insurrection) and disappointingly (Nemesis) at the box office. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center; width:99%;\" !

This film also included original crew members Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig). Following seven seasons of The Next Generation, the next Star Trek film was the first to feature the crew of the Enterprise-D, along with a long prologue sequence featuring three cast members of the original series and the only appearance of the Enterprise-B. ====Star Trek: First Contact (1996)==== After a failed attempt to assault Earth, the Borg attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) warp test in the past. Picard must confront the demons which stem from his assimilation into the Collective (\"The Best of Both Worlds\") as he leads the new Enterprise-E back through time to ensure the test and subsequent meeting with the Vulcans take place. The first of two films directed by series actor Jonathan Frakes. ====Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)==== Profoundly disturbed by what he views as a blatant violation of the Prime Directive, Picard deliberately interferes with a Starfleet admiral's (Anthony Zerbe) plan to relocate a relatively small but seemingly immortal population from a mystical planet to gain control of the planet's natural radiation, which has been discovered to have substantial medicinal properties. However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's (F. Murray Abraham) mission of vengeance. Insurrection brought in Deep Space Nine writer Michael Piller instead of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga who had written for Generations and First Contact. ====Star Trek: Nemesis (2002)==== A clone of Picard (Tom Hardy), created by the Romulans, assassinates the Romulan senate, assumes absolute power, and lures Picard and the Enterprise to Romulus under the false pretext of a peace overture. Written by John Logan and directed by Stuart Baird, this film was a critical and commercial failure (released December 13, 2002 in direct competition with Die Another Day, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) and was the final Star Trek film to feature the Next Generation cast and to be produced by Rick Berman. ===The Kelvin Timeline=== Reboot film logo After the poor reception of Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film, entitled Star Trek: The Beginning, which would take place after Enterprise but before The Original Series. In February 2007, J. J. Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the new film, having been previously attached as producer. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote a screenplay that impressed Abrams, featuring new actors portraying younger versions of the original series' cast. The Enterprise, its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned. This revival of the franchise is often considered to be a reboot, but is also a continuation of the franchise, with Nimoy reprising his role of the elderly Spock. This route was taken to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \"disrespectful\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \"Abramsverse\", \"JJ Trek\" and \"NuTrek\", before it was named the \"Kelvin Timeline\" (versus the \"Prime Timeline\" of the original series and films) by Michael and Denise Okuda for use in official Star Trek reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS Kelvin, a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in Star Trek (2009). Abrams named the starship after his grandfather Henry Kelvin, whom he also pays tribute to in Into Darkness with the Kelvin Memorial Archive. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\" !

Piloting a one- man vessel, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) attempts to contain the supernova by generating an artificial black hole, but is assaulted by a Romulan mining vessel captained by Nero (Eric Bana), who is bent on vengeance for Spock's failure to save Romulus; both vessels are pulled into the black hole and sent back in time to the 23rd century. Nero then captures Spock and uses the black- hole technology to destroy Vulcan. Spock's present-day younger self (Zachary Quinto), who is a Starfleet Academy instructor, and a volatile and arrogant cadet named James Kirk (Chris Pine) must then set aside their current differences, and join forces to prevent Nero from consigning Earth and the rest of the Federation worlds to similar fates. This film acts as a reboot to the existing franchise by taking place in an alternate reality, using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline, featuring younger versions of the primary original series characters. It is the first production to feature an entirely different cast of actors playing roles previously established by other actors, with the exception of the aged Spock played by Nimoy. It was directed by J. J. Abrams (who produced it with Damon Lindelof) and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. According to Lindelof, this production was designed to attract a wider audience. It received positive reviews and a number of awards, including the film franchise's only Academy Award, for \"makeup and hairstyling\". A story that covered the events between Nemesis and Star Trek was released as the graphic novel Countdown in early 2009. ====Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)==== A Starfleet special agent (Benedict Cumberbatch) coerces an officer into blowing up a secret installation in London, shoots up a subsequent meeting of Starfleet brass in San Francisco, and then flees to Qo'noS. The crew of the Enterprise attempt to bring him to justice without provoking war with the Klingon Empire, but find there is much more to the agent's mission, and the man himself, than what the Fleet Admiral (Peter Weller) has told them; the agent is none other than Khan Noonien Singh; his allegiance and his motives are initially not at all clear. ====Star Trek Beyond (2016)==== The Enterprise is ambushed and destroyed by countless alien micro-vessels; the crew abandon ship. Stranded on an unknown planet, and with no apparent means of escape or rescue, they find themselves in conflict with a new sociopathic enemy (Idris Elba) who has a well-founded hatred of the Federation and what it stands for. Star Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016, in time for the franchise's 50th anniversary celebrations. Roberto Orci had stated that Star Trek Beyond will feel more like the original series than its predecessors in the reboot series while still trying something new with the established material. In December 2014, Justin Lin was confirmed as the director for the upcoming sequel, marking the first reboot film not to be directed by J. J. Abrams, whose commitments to Star Wars: The Force Awakens restricted his role on the Star Trek film to that of producer.

Later that month, Paramount announced the return of most of the Beyond cast and producers Abrams and Lindsey Weber; J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay were announced as the writers. Abrams said that Chekov would not be recast following Yelchin's death in a motor vehicle incident. In April 2018, S. J. Clarkson was announced as the film's director. By August 2018, talks with Pine and Hemsworth had fallen through after the studio reportedly wanted to reduce their salaries in response to the disappointing financial performance of Beyond, though Pine stated the next month that he would \"love to be involved\" in the next movie. According to Hemsworth, the reason for his exit was that he found the script underwhelming. In January 2019, Deadline Hollywood reported that Paramount had shelved the project. In December 2017, it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was working on a Star Trek film collaboratively with Abrams, with the intention being that the former will serve as director. Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, Megan Amram and Drew Pearce took part in a writers room, before Paramount finalized a deal with Smith to write the screenplay. The screenplay was completed by June 2019, and is reportedly based on an original series episode which largely takes place on Earth \"in a 1930s gangster setting\". Tarantino hopes to continue developing the movie, describing the story as \"Pulp Fiction in space\", intended to be rated R. William Shatner has expressed his openness to reprising his role as Kirk for the project. In January 2020, Tarantino stated that the film might be made, but that he would probably not direct it. In November 2019, a Star Trek film was announced to be in development with Noah Hawley in talks to serve as writer and director. Hawley would also serve as producer alongside Abrams in a joint venture between their production studios, 26 Keys and Bad Robot, respectively. Hawley said of the project: \"For me, it's ... a new direction, but it's still early, in terms of who exactly would be in it or what the characters would be. I don't think of it as Star Trek 4, to be reductive. This is a new beginning.\" He later explained in more detail that \"We're not doing Kirk and we're not doing Picard,\" calling his treatment \"a start from scratch\". In August 2020, it was announced that Hawley's movie had been put on hold, reportedly by Paramount's new president to get a better handle on how to move the film franchise forward. In an interview with Den of Geek in July 2020, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan producer Robert Sallin teased the possibility of a new Star Trek film, saying, \"I don't have it completely written, but I have a lot of it written, I have a concept for another Star Trek feature that I've had discussions with Paramount about (at least on the phone). This one I guarantee you is unlike anything that has been done in Star Trek, and it will be part of the canon, but they (the studio) don't want to talk about it until they see what Noah Hawley does. I hope one day to be able to have the meeting and have them say, 'Hey, Bob, come on in, let's talk about that.'\" ==See also== * List of Star Trek production staff ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * Star Trek Category:Star Trek lists Category:Lists of films and television series \\- - ",
