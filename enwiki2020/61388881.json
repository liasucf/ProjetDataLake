    "text": "This is a List of Mormon place names, meaning towns and other places named, in modern times, after places and people in the Book of Mormon, after Mormon leaders during the settlement of Utah, or after other elements of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' history. See List of Book of Mormon places for a reference list of locations mentioned in the Book of Mormon, and List of Book of Mormon people for persons mentioned therein. The intention is to list all places named (usually by Mormons) for specifically Mormon places and people, where those names are not otherwise generally known as Biblical (meaning from the Old and New Testaments) to non-Mormons.So this will include places named after Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet), but should not include places, if there are any, named after Lehi (Bible), a somewhat obscure place in the Book of Judges in the Old Testament. This does not include places generally known to be Biblical/Christian, such as most listed as biblical place names in North America. For example Goshen, is notably the name of a bible place, and was used as name for Goshen, Utah in Utah County, by the first LDS bishop of that area, Phineas Cook, but he named it after his birthplace, Goshen, Connecticut, according to Davidson. Which is named after Land of Goshen in Egypt, mentioned in the Old Testament, so Goshen, Utah is only indirectly named for a biblical place, and the biblical place is not specifically Mormon, so it is doubly not the type of place covered in this list. According to John W. Van Cott in his 1990 work Utah Place Names, the Mormons named more places in Utah than any other group or individual in the state. (sourced mainly to Utah Place Names, by John W. Van Cott, 1990 edition) Salt Lake City Tribune author Davidson noted, in 2018, that \"Utah cities and towns were named for at least five church presidents, 10 apostles, 11 stake presidents, nine bishops, two biblical figures and three Book of Mormon prophets, among other things.\" Similar general works for other regions, such as Idaho Place Names, identify numerous other Mormon place names. ==Place names== The intention is to list all modern usages of place names that are clearly Mormon, to exclusion of other Christian place names.
