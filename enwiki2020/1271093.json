    "text": "Skank is a Brazilian band from Belo Horizonte. Having begun in 1991, they sold approximately 5,200,000 copies of their albums as of 2004. Initially intending to mix dancehall with traditional Brazilian styles, later the band changed its sonority to music closer to Britpop and local movement Clube da Esquina. ==Biography== In 1983, Samuel Rosa (guitars, vocals) and Henrique Portugal (keyboards) started to play in a reggae band called \"Pouso Alto\", along with Dinho Mour\u00e3o (drums) and his brother Alexandre (bass). In 1991, Pouso Alto arranged for a performance in S\u00e3o Paulo, but due to the Mour\u00e3o brothers not being in Belo Horizonte, bassist Lelo Zaneti and drummer Haroldo Ferretti were called for the gig. The band premiered on June 5, 1991, and due to the performance competing with the Campeonato Paulista final match, the audience was 37 people. After the show, the group changed its name to Skank, inspired by Bob Marley's song \"Easy skanking\", and began to perform regularly at \"Mister Beef\" churrascaria in Belo Horizonte. ===Skank (1992/1993)=== After playing for some time in churrascarias, bars and clubhouses, the band spent US$10,000 in their first album, Skank, released as an independent CD in late 1992 with 3,000 copies, fully paid by the band members themselves. In 45 days, 1,200 were sold,Revista Bizz, 1993 O Brasil vai dan\u00e7ar and Sony Music signed the band as the first Brazilian act in its Chaos label. Skank was re-released in April 1993. The singles \"O Homem Que Sabia Demais\", \"Tanto\" (version of Bob Dylan's \"I Want You\") and \"In(Dig)Na\u00e7\u00e3o\" took the group on a 120 concerts tour around Brazil, and the album sold 250 thousand copies. ===Calango (1994)=== Calango (1994) was the first record produced by Dudu Marote. \"\u00c9 Proibido Fumar\", \"Te Ver\", \"Pacato Cidad\u00e3o\", \"Esmola\" and \"Jackie Tequila\" were hits, and Calango sold around 1,200,000 copies.Revista Oi ===O Samba Pocon\u00e9 (1996)=== O Samba Pocon\u00e9 was released in 1996. The album had three big hits, \"T\u00e3o Seu\", \"\u00c9 Uma Partida de Futebol\", included by FIFA in the official soundtrack for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and \"Garota Nacional\", which topped the Spanish charts for three monthsO Fuxico (under the Spanish title \"Chica Nacional\"), was the only Portuguese language song in the Sony Music compilation Soundtrack for a Century, released in 1997 to celebrate the company's centennial, and took the group on tour in Argentina, Chile, United States, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. Although \"Garota Nacional\" literally translates to \"national girl\", the song is not about the women of Brazil: it celebrates the \"girls of Bar Nacional\", a bar and nightclub in Belo Horizonte famous in the early 1990s for the beauty of its female patrons. Manu Chao featured in \"Sem Terra\", \"Los Pretos\" e \"Z\u00e9 Trindade\". \"O Samba Pocon\u00e9\" sold 1,800,000 c\u00f3pias - 800,000 of those in two months. ===Siderado (1998)=== Siderado, produced by John Shaw (UB40) and Paul Ralphes, begins the band's movement towards a more rock and roll sound. The Clube da Esquina-influenced \"Resposta\" (re-recorded in 1999 by Milton Nascimento and L\u00f4 Borges, the latter the song's co-author with Samuel Rosa and Nando Reis), \"Mandrake e Os Cubanos\" and \"Saideira\" were hits. Released in 1998, Siderado sold 750 thousand copies.Revista Oi Da\u00fade and Uakti participated as guest artists. In 1999 Skank recorded a Spanish language version for \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" in a tribute album for The Police entitled Outlandos d'America. ===Maquinarama (2000)=== With Maquinarama, the band begins in earnest its move away from the ska and reggae sound towards a more rock oriented one influence by The Beatles, Clube da Esquina, Britpop and contemporary alternative rock. Maquinarama, produced by Chico Neves and Tom Capone and released in July 2000, sold 275 thousand copies. Some of the hit singles were \"Tr\u00eas Lados\", \"Balada do Amor Inabal\u00e1vel\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o Noturna\". The original cover shows a Cadillac with graffiti by Californian artist Kenny Scharf. The international version has a different cover. ===MTV ao vivo (2001)=== In 2001, Skank recorded the first live album in Ouro Preto as part of the MTV Brasil's series \"MTV Ao Vivo\". MTV Ao Vivo sold 600 thousand copies. Besides a list of hits chosen by fans through Skank's website, the album had the new song \"Acima do Sol\", a national hit. In 2002 Samuel Rosa played acoustic guitar in \"\u00c9 Proibido Fumar\", from the Ac\u00fastico MTV (MTV Unplugged) by Roberto Carlos. ===Cosmotron (2003)=== Cosmotron, produced by Skank and Tom Capone, was released in July 2003 and sold 250 thousand copies - a disappointment next to their vigorous previous sales figures. Nevertheless, the album had many radio and ringtone hits. \"Supernova\", \"Dois Rios\", \"Vou Deixar\" and \"Amores Imperfeitos\" were the main tracks. Cosmotron won the Latin Grammy - best Brazilian rock album award in 2004. ===Radiola (2004)=== Released in October 2004, Radiola was the first compilation album by Skank. It included four new songs, including the Gilberto Gil cover \"Vamos Fugir\". The cover reproduces a painting by the hyped Los Angeles artists the Clayton Brothers. Radiola sold 200 thousand copies. ===Carrossel (2006)=== In March 2006 Skank began recording the new album Carrossel in their studio in Belo Horizonte, with producers Chico Neves, who also worked in Maquinarama, and Carlos Eduardo Miranda, producer of O Rappa's Unplugged album. Released in August, the album had the semi-hits \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o \u00c9 Pra Isso\" and \"Mil Acasos\". Arnaldo Antunes (\"Trancoso\"), C\u00e9sar Mauricio (\"Lugar\") and Humberto Effe (\"Cara Nua\" and \"Not\u00edcia\") were the songwriting partners. ===Estandarte (2008)=== In 2008, the band reunited with Dudu Marote, who produced Calango and O Samba Pocon\u00e9, to record the album Estandarte in their studio in Belo Horizonte. Released in September, the album had low sales, but produced the hits \"Ainda Gosto Dela\" (featuring Negra Li), \"Sutilmente\" (a massive number 1 hit in Brazil) and \"Noites de um Ver\u00e3o Qualquer.\" ===Multishow ao Vivo (2010)=== On June 19, 2010, Skank performed a free concert on the Mineir\u00e3o stadium in Belo Horizonte. It was the last event before the venue was closed to reform in order to accommodate the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The show was recorded for the live album and DVD Multishow Ao Vivo - Skank no Mineir\u00e3o, which featured two new songs, \"De Repente\" and \"Fotos na Estante\".Skank anuncia show de gra\u00e7a no Mineir\u00e3o dia 19 de junho , Hoje em Dia ==International career== Skank had some success with \"Garota Nacional\", that lead the Spanish charts, and \"\u00c9 Uma Partida de Futebol\" was shown before some games of the 1998 World Cup due to being in the championship's soundtrack. By the time of O Samba Pocon\u00e9, the group toured through Hispanic America and Europe, and appeared in big festivals such as Super Bock/Super Rock 1997 in Portugal, P\u00e1leo Festival 97 and St. Gallen 98 in Switzerland, Montreux Jazz Festival 2001, and SummerStage 2002 in New York City. The group also played in two editions of Rock in Rio, at the 2008 Rock in Rio Lisboa and the fourth Brazilian edition of the festival in 2011. Skank had been previously called for Rock in Rio II] in 2001, but went out along with other Brazilian bands in protest against O Rappa's exclusion. However, the band never invested much in its international career. Some songs received versions in Spanish, such as \"Chica Nacional\" (\"Garota Nacional\"), and \"Respuesta\" (\"Resposta\"), but foreign shows are usually in places with many Brazilians, such as Miami and New York City. == Members == *Samuel Rosa - lead vocals, electric and occasional acoustic guitars *Lelo Zaneti - bass, backing vocals *Henrique Portugal - keyboard, backing vocals *Haroldo Ferretti - drums ;Current touring members *Paulo M\u00e1rcio - trumpet (1998\u2013present) *Doca Rolim - acoustic and electric guitars, occasional backing vocals (2003\u2013present) *Pedro Aristides - trombone (2003\u2013present) *Vin\u00edcius Augustus - saxophone (2008\u2013present) ;Former touring members * Marcos Gauguin - electric guitar (1991) * Chico Amaral - saxophone (1991\u201398, 2017), acoustic guitar (on Maquinarama tour) * Jo\u00e3o Vianna - trumpet (1991\u201398) * Ed Maciel - trombone (1994\u201396) * Edivaldo Silva - trombone (1996\u201398) * Jorge Continentino - saxophone (1999-2001) * Wagner Mayer - trombone (1999-2001) == Discography == ;Studio Albums {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
