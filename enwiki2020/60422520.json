That was his sole senior appearance until 2010, when he played the first of fifty-two fixtures for fellow fifth tier team Sportivo Barracas; though his first match for the club came in Primera C Metropolitana, prior to their relegation in 2009\u201310. After leaving Sportivo Barracas, Godoy spent the 2013\u201314 season with Yupanqui. In 2015, following a six-month stint with Juventud Unida, Godoy joined General Lamadrid. He scored four goals in nineteen total games, before departing to sign for Estudiantes. In 2016, after appearances for Estudiantes versus Platense, F\u00e9nix and Comunicaciones in Primera B Metropolitana, Godoy completed a move to fourth tier team Sportivo Italiano. He remained for two years, participating in thirty-six fixtures and netting three goals. On 3 August 2018, Godoy returned to the third tier after being signed by Acassuso. His debut didn't arrive until 18 March 2019, as he came off the bench in an away defeat to UAI Urquiza. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Deportivo Riestra |2004\u201305 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera D Metropolitana |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sportivo Barracas |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera C Metropolitana |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Yupanqui |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera D Metropolitana |25||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||25||4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|General Lamadrid |2015 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera C Metropolitana |17||3||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Estudiantes |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Metropolitana |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||3||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Acassuso |2018\u201319 |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !49!!7!!2!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!51!!8 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Fernando Partido Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primera D Metropolitana players Category:Primera C Metropolitana players Category:Primera B Metropolitana players Category:Deportivo Riestra players Category:Sportivo Barracas players Category:Club Social y Deportivo Yupanqui players Category:Juventud Unida de San Miguel players Category:General Lamadrid footballers Category:Estudiantes de Buenos Aires footballers Category:Sportivo Italiano footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Acassuso footballers ",
