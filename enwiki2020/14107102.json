    "text": ":For the 1937 Tennessee Williams play, see Fugitive Kind. The Fugitive Kind is a 1960 American drama film starring Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani, and Joanne Woodward, directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Meade Roberts and Tennessee Williams was based on the latter's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, itself a revision of his 1940 work Battle of Angels, which closed after its Boston tryout. Despite being set in the Deep South, the United Artists release was filmed in Milton, New York. At the 1960 San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, it won the Silver Seashell for Sidney Lumet and the Zulueta Prize for Best Actress for Joanne Woodward. The film is available on videotape and DVD. A two-disc DVD edition by The Criterion Collection was released in April 2010. It was upgraded to Blu-Ray in January 2020. A stage production also took place in 2010 at the Arclight Theatre starring Michael Brando, grandson of Marlon Brando, in the lead role. That particular production used the edited film version of the text as opposed to the original play. ==Plot== Valentine \"Snakeskin\" Xavier is a guitar-playing drifter who earns his nickname from his jacket. He flees New Orleans to a small town in order to avoid imprisonment. On his 30th birthday he decides to change his drifting \"party boy\" life. He finds work in a small-town mercantile store operated by an embittered older woman known as Lady Torrance, whose vicious husband Jabe lies ill in their apartment above the store. An undercurrent of violence, past and present, dominates the town. Both the frequently drunk libertine Carol Cutrere and simple housewife Vee Talbott set their sights on the newcomer, but Snakeskin is attracted to Lady, who has grand plans to open a beautifully decorated \"ladies confectionery\" wing to the run down store. Sheriff Talbott, a friend of Jabe as well as Vee's husband, threatens to kill Snakeskin if he remains in town, but he chooses to stay when he discovers Lady is pregnant. It sparks Jabe's final acts of resentment, leading to tragic consequences. ==Cast== * Marlon Brando as Valentine \"Snakeskin\" Xavier * Joanne Woodward as Carol Cutrere * Anna Magnani as Lady Torrance * Maureen Stapleton as Vee Talbot * Victor Jory as Jabe Torrance * R.

Lumet's direction is either ponderous or pretentious, and he failed to crack the problem of the florid stage dialogue and a dangerously weak role for Brando\",Time Out London Film Guide review and Channel 4 describes it as \"a less than satisfying experience . . . disappointing stuff.\"Channel 4 review ==In popular culture== Some dialogue from a scene in the film was used by Australian hip hop trio Bliss n Eso in their song \"Never Land\", off their album Running on Air. Sailor Ripley (Nicolas Cage) wears a snakeskin jacket exactly like Val's in the film Wild at Heart. ==See also== * List of American films of 1960 ==References== ==External links== * * * * *The Fugitive Kind: When Sidney Went to Tennessee an essay by David Thomson at the Criterion Collection Category:1960 films Category:American drama films Category:1960 drama films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films set in New Orleans Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films with screenplays by Tennessee Williams Category:Southern Gothic films Category:Films directed by Sidney Lumet Category:American films Category:Films based on works by Tennessee Williams Category:Films scored by Kenyon Hopkins ",
