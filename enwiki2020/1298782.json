In the Hamburg side was former Liverpool striker Kevin Keegan. They went on to beat Club Brugge 1\u20130 thanks to a Kenny Dalglish goal to retain the European Cup. Manchester United were thrown out of the European Cup Winners' Cup on owing to the behaviour of their fans in the away leg of their tie against St. \u00c9tienne. They were reinstated a week later, but had to play the second leg at least 300 km from Manchester, at Plymouth Argyle's Home Park ground. ==FA Cup== Bobby Robson led Ipswich Town to victory in the FA Cup, winning the final 1\u20130 against Arsenal. Northern League side Blyth Spartans beat Second Division Stoke City 3\u20132 away to become the first non-League team to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup since 1949. They were seconds away from reaching the quarter-finals, but Wrexham equalised from a retaken corner kick before winning a replay. ==League Cup== Nottingham Forest won the League Cup after victory over Liverpool in the replay. ==Football League== ===First Division=== Nottingham Forest won the First Division title with just three league defeats all season, one season after promotion. In doing so, their manager Brian Clough became only the second manager in English football to win the First Division title with different clubs. Clough's men also won the Football League Cup. It was the first time that Forest had won either trophy. Liverpool finished runners-up in the league and retained the European Cup. Everton, Manchester City and Arsenal completed the top five. West Bromwich Albion finished sixth and sealed a UEFA Cup place, having continued to impress in the First Division following the mid-season resignation of Ronnie Allen as manager and the appointment of Ron Atkinson as his successor. Manchester United broke the British transfer fee record on 9 February by paying Leeds United \u00a3495,000 for Scottish defender Gordon McQueen but finished a disappointing 10th, having sacked Tommy Docherty in the close season following the revelation of his affair with the wife of the club's physiotherapist. His replacement was former QPR boss Dave Sexton. Leicester City and Newcastle United were bracketed together on 22 points after a terrible First Division campaign, Newcastle's relegation coming just one season after they had finished fifth in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup. They were joined in the drop zone by West Ham United, the 1975 FA Cup winners, who kept faith in manager John Lyall and managed to hold onto key players Billy Bonds and Trevor Brooking. ===Second Division=== After narrowly missing out on promotion for the last two seasons, Bolton Wanderers finally ended their lengthy absence from the First Division by clinching the Second Division title. Southampton finished a point behind them in second place, ending their four-year absence from the First Division, during which they had won the FA Cup in 1976. Tottenham Hotspur clinched the final promotion place on goal difference, their advantage over fourth-placed Brighton being assisted by a 9-0 scoreline over Bristol Rovers in October 1977, during which striker Colin Lee had scored four goals on his club debut. For much of the season it had been a four-horse race at the top of the Second Division, with fifth placed Blackburn Rovers finishing 11 points behind the leading pack. Hull City were relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1966, after a campaign in which four different managers took charge of the team. Mansfield Town were relegated straight back to Division Three after a year, never looking like they would survive in their first-ever season at this level, though a late fightback after the appointment of veteran manager Billy Bingham at least saw them avoid last place. Blackpool were the final relegated side; they had been safely in mid-table for much of the campaign, but a disastrous end to the season combined with a host of other results going against them sent them down to the third tier for the first time ever. Despite the manner of their relegation, it wouldn't be until 2007 before they returned to this level. ===Third Division=== Wrexham won the Third Division title to clinch a place in the Second Division. They were joined by Cambridge United and Preston North End. Peterborough United, who had yet to progress beyond this level of the league, missed out on promotion on goal difference. Chester, another club with a similar track record in the league, finished two points short of the promotion places. Portsmouth, the 1939 FA Cup winners and with two league titles to their name from the early postwar years, finished bottom of the Third Division to fall into the Fourth Division for the first time, and their very existence was also threatened by large debts. Hereford United, Bradford City and Port Vale also went down. ===Fourth Division=== Graham Taylor guided Watford to the Fourth Division title by an 11-point margin to repeat the promotion success he had achieved at Lincoln City two seasons earlier. Southend United finished second, while John Toshack kicked off his managerial career by taking Swansea City to promotion just weeks after being appointed. Brentford clinched the final promotion place, with Aldershot missing out on promotion by two points. Wimbledon played their first season in the Football League, replacing Workington. Southport, having finished second-from-bottom for the third season in succession, were voted out of the Football League and replaced by Wigan Athletic. This would ultimately prove the final occasion where a football club failed to earn re-election to the League, and the same 92 clubs would continue to make up its membership until 1987, by which point automatic promotion and relegation between the League and the Football Conference had been introduced. ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Bob Latchford (Everton) \u2013 30 goals Second Division *Bob Hatton (Blackpool) \u2013 22 goals Third Division *Alex Bruce (Preston North End) \u2013 27 goals Fourth Division *Alan Curtis (Swansea City), Steve Phillips (Brentford) \u2013 32 goals ==Non-league football== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Competition !Winners |- |Isthmian League |Enfield |- |Northern Premier League |Boston United |- |Southern League |Bath City |- |FA Trophy |Altrincham |- |FA Vase |Newcastle Blue Star |} ==Awards== Football Writers' Association * FWA Footballer of the Year \u2013 Kenny Burns, Nottingham Forest Professional Footballers' Association * PFA Players' Player of the Year \u2013 Peter Shilton, Nottingham Forest * PFA Young Player of the Year \u2013 Tony Woodcock, Nottingham Forest * PFA Merit Award \u2013 Bill Shankly ==Famous debutants== 3 September 1977: Cyrille Regis, 19-year-old French Guiana born striker, makes his debut for West Bromwich Albion against Middlesbrough at home in the First Division, scoring in a 2\u20131 win.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football- heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43080 15 April 1978: Terry Butcher, 19-year-old defender, makes his debut for Ipswich Town in the 1\u20130 First Division defeat by Everton at Goodison Park.http://www.sporting- heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38741 ==Deaths== * 30 August 1977 - Alf Young, 71, played 283 league games in defence for Huddersfield Town between 1929 and 1939 and was capped nine times for England before his career was cut short by the war.
