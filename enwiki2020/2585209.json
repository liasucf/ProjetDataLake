    "text": "Silhouette Island lies northwest of Mah\u00e9 in the Seychelles. It is the third largest granitic island in the Seychelles. It has an area of 20.1 km2 and has a population of 200, mostly workers on the island on the Somali Sea. The main settlement is La Passe, where Hilton Hotel is located. The name Silhouette was given after \u00c9tienne de Silhouette (1709-1767), the French minister of finances under Louis XV. ==Geography== The island is mountainous with five peaks over in elevation; Mont Dauban , Mont-Pot-a-Eau , Gratte Fesse , Mont Corgat and Mont Cocos Marrons . As such, it has some of the most dramatic scenery of the islands. Though superficially similar to neighbouring islands, much of Silhouette is made up of younger syenite dated from 63 million years ago. Between Point Ramasse Tout and Point Zeng Zeng lies the only surface volcanic ash in Seychelles. ==Demographics== The population of 200 lives in 3 villages, Grand Barbe, which is on the west coast, Anse Mondon and La Passe on the East coast.Historical Information on Silhouette ==History== The crew of an English East India Company vessel, the Ascension, were the first humans known to step ashore on Silhouette, in 1609. The island was visited by Charles Oger, who took possession of it in the name of the King of France on 28 January 1771. Graves discovered at Anse Lascars were thought to be evidence of earlier visitors, possibly of Arabic origin (hence the name \"Lascars\", which is the local term for an Arab). However, when bones from the graves were taken for investigation, they were dated to around 1800, around the time of the first settlement. Also, there is a legend in the Seychelles that the corsair Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Hodoul buried his treasure on Silhouette Island. From the mid-19th century until 1960, the island was owned by the Dauban family, who were originally from France but had settled in Mauritius in 1830. The Dauban family were responsible for developing extensive plantations on Silhouette. There is a mausoleum built in the style of La Madeleine in Paris, \u00c9glise de la Madeleine, where a number of the family members are buried, including Auguste Dauban, whose business ventures were so extensive he earned the nickname \"the Rothschild of the Indian Ocean\". The Dauban era came to an end when Henri Dauban sold the island to a French group. Following the purchase of the island by the Seychelles government in 1983, a small hotel was constructed. This was later replaced by the larger Labriz Resort which was then bought by the Hilton hotel group.Official site The Dauban plantation house has recently been restored, and now is a museum which contains many original photos of the Dauban family. ==Flora and fauna== Silhouette Island is one of the richest biodiversity points in the western Indian Ocean with many endemic and threatened plant and animal species. Among the most important is the Critically Endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bat. Two roosting caves have been located, part of a single system of passages in a boulder field. Another roost complex was discovered in 2005 and 32 bats recorded. Most of the 75 or so endemic plants of the granitic islands of Seychelles are found on Silhouette, some of them unique to the island. One of the rarest of these is the Critically Endangered Impatiens gordonii, a white-flowered relative of the well-known garden plant Busy Lizzie, only ever recorded on Mahe and Silhouette. In 1987 the surrounding waters were declared a Marine National Park. In 2010, Silhouette National Park was created protecting 93 percent of the landmass. The island is also an Important Bird Area and is considered by the Alliance for Zero Extinction to be an important site for the survival of Critically Endangered species. Conservation of the island is managed by the Island Conservation Society.Island Conservation Society ==Species of interest== * Coleura seychellensis, the Seychelles sheath-tailed bat * Seychelles giant tortoise * Schefflera procumbens * Seychelles kestrel * Seychelles blue pigeon ==Gallery== Primary School House on Silhouette IslandRenovated original, traditional house of the Dauban family.
