    "text": "Davor \u0160uker scored two hat-tricks for Croatia Since the inception of international association football matches in 1872, nine Croatian footballers have scored three or more goals (a hat-trick) in a game. The first player to score a hat-trick for Croatia was August Le\u0161nik in a friendly match against Slovakia in 1942. Davor \u0160uker was the first player in modern Croatian national team history to achieve this feat, scoring three times in a 7\u20131 victory over Estonia in 1995. He is also the one of two players alongside Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 who scored a hat-trick more than once, grabbing his second hat-trick in Croatia's 7\u20130 win against Australia. Mladen Petri\u0107 has scored the greatest number of goals in one game, netting four times against Andorra. The most recent hat-trick was scored by Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 in Croatia's 6\u20130 victory over Kosovo in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. Croatia have conceded four hat-tricks since 1941, the most recent being scored by Theo Walcott in a 4\u20131 defeat by England in the qualifications for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The other three hat-tricks were scored by J\u00e1n Arp\u00e1\u0161, Primo\u017e Gliha and Zlatan Muslimovi\u0107. ==Hat-tricks for Croatia== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" ! width=\"100\"|Date ! width=\"30\" |Goals ! width=\"120\"|Player ! width=\"170\"|Opponent ! width=\"230\"|Venue ! width=\"180\"|Competition ! width=\"50\" |Result !class=\"unsortable\" width=\"90\"|Report |- | | | | | Stadion Concordije, Zagreb | Friendly | data- sort-value=\"06\" | | |- | | | | | Stadion Concordije, Zagreb | Friendly | data- sort-value=\"07\" | | |- | | | | | Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | | data-sort- value=\"07\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | | | | | Stadion Kranj\u010devi\u0107eva, Zagreb | Friendly | data-sort-value=\"03\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | | | | | Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | Friendly | data-sort-value=\"07\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | | | | | Stadion Gradski vrt, Osijek | 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying | data-sort-value=\"04\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | | | | | Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | | data-sort-value=\"07\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | | | | | Ramat Gan Stadium, Ramat Gan | | data-sort- value=\"04\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- | rowspan=2 | | | | rowspan=\"2\"| | rowspan=\"2\"|Stadion Rujevica, Rijeka | rowspan=\"2\"|Friendly | rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"10\" | | rowspan=\"2\"|HNS-CFF.hr |- | | |- | | | | | Loro Bori\u00e7i Stadium, Shkod\u00ebr | 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying | data-sort-value=\"6\" | | HNS-CFF.hr |- |} ==Hat-tricks conceded by Croatia== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" ! width=\"100\"|Date ! width=\"30\" |Goals ! width=\"120\"|Player ! width=\"170\"|Opponent ! width=\"230\"|Venue ! width=\"180\"|Competition ! width=\"50\" |Result !class=\"unsortable\" width=\"90\"|Report |- | | | | | Stadion Concordije, Zagreb | Friendly | data- sort-value=\"7\" | | |- | | | | | Stadion Poljud, Split | 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying | data-sort-value=\"3\" | | Sportnet.hr |- | | | | | Asim Ferhatovi\u0107 Hase Stadium, Sarajevo | Friendly | data-sort-value=\"5\" | | Sportnet.hr |- | | | | | Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying | data-sort- value=\"1\" | | Sportnet.hr |} ==Notes== The result is presented with Croatia's score first. ==References== Croatia Category:Croatia national football team Hat-tricks ",
