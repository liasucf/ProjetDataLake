    "text": "Title page of a German translation of the Qur\u02bban published in 1775 Translations of the Qur\u02bban are considered interpretations of the scripture of Islam in languages other than Arabic. The Qur\u02bban was originally written in the Arabic language and has been translated into most major African, Asian and European languages. == Islamic theology == The translation of the Qur\u02bban into modern languages has always been a difficult issue in Islamic theology. Because Muslims revere the Qur\u02bban as miraculous and inimitable (i\u02bbjaz al- Qur\u02bban), they argue that the Qur\u02bbanic text should not be isolated from its true form to another language or written form, at least not without keeping the Arabic text with it. Furthermore, an Arabic word, like a Hebrew or Aramaic word, may have a range of meanings depending on the context \u2013 a feature present in all Semitic languages, when compared to English, Latin, and Romance languages \u2013 making an accurate translation even more difficult. According to Islamic theology, the Qur\u02bban is a revelation very specifically in Arabic, and so it should only be recited in Quranic Arabic. Translations into other languages are necessarily the work of humans and so, according to Muslims, no longer possess the uniquely sacred character of the Arabic original. Since these translations necessarily subtly change the meaning, they are often called \"interpretations\" or \"translation[s] of the meanings\" (with \"meanings\" being ambiguous between the meanings of the various passages and the multiple possible meanings with which each word taken in isolation can be associated, and with the latter connotation amounting to an acknowledgement that the so- called translation is but one possible interpretation and is not claimed to be the full equivalent of the original). For instance, Pickthall called his translation The Meaning of the Glorious Koran rather than simply The Koran. The task of translation of the Qur\u02bban is not an easy one; some native Arab speakers will confirm that some Qur\u02bbanic passages are difficult to understand even in the original Arabic script. A part of this is the innate difficulty of any translation; in Arabic, as in other languages, a single word can have a variety of meanings. There is always an element of human judgement involved in understanding and translating a text. This factor is made more complex by the fact that the usage of words has changed a great deal between classical and modern Arabic. As a result, even Qur\u02bbanic verses which seem perfectly clear to native Arab speakers accustomed to modern vocabulary and usage may not represent the original meaning of the verse. The original meaning of a Qur\u02bbanic passage will also be dependent on the historical circumstances of the prophet Muhammad's life and early community in which it originated. Investigating that context usually requires a detailed knowledge of hadith and sirah, which are themselves vast and complex texts. This introduces an additional element of uncertainty which cannot be eliminated by any linguistic rules of translation. == History == The first translation of the Qur\u02bban was performed by Salman the Persian, who translated surah al-Fatiha into the Middle Persian in the early seventh century.An-Nawawi, Al-Majmu', (Cairo, Matbacat at-'Tadamun n.d.), 380. According to Islamic tradition contained in the hadith, the Negus of the Ethiopian Empire and the Byzantine emperor Heraclius received letters from Muhammad containing verses from the Qur\u02bban. However, during Muhammad's lifetime, no passage from the Qur\u02bban was ever translated into these languages nor any other. The second known translation was into Greek and was used by Nicetas Byzantius, a scholar from Constantinople, in his 'Refutation of Qur\u02bban' written between 855 and 870. However, we know nothing about who and for what purpose had made this translation. It is however very probable that it was a complete translation.Christian H\u00f8gel, \"An early anonymous Greek translation of the Qur\u02bban. The fragments from Niketas Byzantios' Refutatio and the anonymous Abjuratio\", Collectanea Christiana Orientalia 7 (2010), pp. 65\u2013119; Kees Versteegh, \"Greek translations of the Qur\u02bban in Christian polemics (9th century)\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft 141 (1991); Ast\u00e9rios Argyriou, \"Perception de l'Islam et traductions du Coran dans le monde byzantin grec\", Byzantion 75 (2005). The first fully attested complete translations of the Qur\u02bban were done between the 10th and 12th centuries into Classical Persian. The Samanid emperor, Mansur I (961\u2013976), ordered a group of scholars from Khorasan to translate the Tafsir al-Tabari, originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari wrote a complete tafsir of the Qur\u02bban in Persian. In the 12th century, Najm al-Din 'Umar al-Nasafi translated the Qur\u02bban into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times. In 1936, translations in 102 languages were known. === European languages === ==== Latin ==== Bertrandon de la Broqui\u00e8re giving a Latin translation of the Qur\u02bban to Philip the Bold (detail). Illustration (folio 152v) by from BnF, MS fr. 9087, made in Lille in 1455. Robertus Ketenensis produced the first Latin translation of the Qur\u02bban in 1143. His version was entitled Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete (\"The law of Mahomet the false prophet\"). The translation was made at the behest of Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, and currently exists in the Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Arsenal in Paris. According to modern scholars, the translation tended to \"exaggerate harmless text to give it a nasty or licentious sting\" and preferred improbable and unpleasant meanings over likely and decent ones. Ketenensis' work was republished in 1543 in three editions by Theodore Bibliander at Basel along with Cluni corpus and other Christian propaganda. All editions contained a preface by Martin Luther. Many later European \"translations\" of the Qur\u02bban merely translated Ketenensis' Latin version into their own language, as opposed to translating the Qur\u02bban directly from Arabic. As a result, early European translations of the Qur\u02bban were erroneous and distorted. In the early thirteenth century, Mark of Toledo made another, more literal, translation into Latin, which survives in a number of manuscripts. In the fifteenth century, Juan of Segovia produced another translation in collaboration with the Mudejar writer, Isa of Segovia. Only the prologue survives. In the sixteenth century, Juan Gabriel Terrolensis aided Cardenal Eguida da Viterbo in another translation into Latin. In the early seventeenth century, another translated was made, attributed to Cyril Lucaris. Louis Maracci (1612\u20131700), a teacher of Arabic at the Sapienza University of Rome and confessor to Pope Innocent XI, issued a second Latin translation in 1698 in Padua.Samuel Marinus Zwemer: Translations of the Koran , The Moslem World, 1915 His edition contains the Qur\u02bban's Arabic text with a Latin translation, annotations to further understanding and \u2013 embued by the time's spirit of controversy \u2013 an essay titled \"Refutation of the Qur\u02bban\", where Marracci disproves Islam from the then Catholic point of view. Despite the refutatio's anti-Islamic tendency Marracci's translation is accurate and suitably commented; besides, by quoting many Islamic sources he certainly broadens his time's horizon considerably. Marracci's translation too became the source of other European translations (one in France by Savory, and one in German by Nerreter). These later translations were quite inauthentic, and one even claimed to be published in Mecca in 1165 AH. ==== Modern languages ==== The first translation in a modern European language was in Castilian Spanish or Aragonese by the convert Juan Andr\u00e9s (or so he claims in his Confusi\u00f3n o Confutaci\u00f3n de la secta mahom\u00e9tica y del alcor\u00e1n) but this translation is lost. A few dozen Qur\u02bban verses into Castilian are found within the Confusi\u00f3n itself. There were lost translations in Catalan, one of them by Francesc Pons Saclota in 1382, the other appeared in Perpignan in 1384. Another Romance translation was made into Italian, 1547 by Andrea Arrivabene, derived from Ketenensis'. The Italian translation was used to derive the first German translation Salomon Schweigger in 1616 in Nuremberg, which in turn was used to derive the first Dutch translation in 1641. The first French translation came out in 1647, and again in 1775, issued by Andr\u00e9 du Ryer. The Du Ryer translation also fathered many re-translations, most notably an English version by Alexander Ross in 1649. Ross' version was used to derive several others: a Dutch version by Glazemaker, a German version by Lange. ==== French Language ==== L'Alcoran de Mahomet by Andr\u00e9 du Ryer, 1647. L'Alcoran de Mahomet / translat\u00e9 d'Arabe Fran\u00e7ois par le Sieur Du Ryer, Sieur de la Garde Malezair., 1647, 1649, 1672, 1683, 1719, 1734, 1770, 1775, by Andr\u00e9 Du Ryer, was the first French translation. This was followed two centuries later in Paris by the 1840 translation by Kasimirski who was an interpreter for the French Persian legation. Then in the mid-twentieth century a new translation was done by R\u00e9gis Blach\u00e8re a French Orientalist followed few years later in 1959 by the first translation by a Muslim into the French Language from the original Arabic . This work of Muhammad Hamidullah continues to be reprinted and published in Paris and Lebanon as it is regarded as the most linguistically accurate of all translation although critics may complain there is some loss of the spirit of the Arabic original. ==== Spanish ==== There are four complete translations of the Qur\u02bban in modern Spanish that are commonly available. * Julio Cortes translation 'El Coran' is widely available in North America, being published by New York-based Tahrike Tarsile Qur\u02bban publishing house. * Ahmed Abboud and Rafael Castellanos, two converts to Islam of Argentine origin, published 'El Sagrado Coran' (El Nilo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1953). * Kamel Mustafa Hallak fine deluxe hardback print 'El Coran Sagrado' is printed by Maryland-based Amana Publications. * Abdel Ghani Melara Navio a Spaniard who converted to Islam in 1979, his 'Traduccion-Comentario Del Noble Coran' was originally published by Darussalam Publications, Riyadh, in December 1997. The King Fahd Printing Complex has their own version of this translation, with editing by Omar Kaddoura and Isa Amer Quevedo. ==== English ==== An engraving of Muhammad in The Life of Mahomet, containing an English translation of the Qur\u02bban derived from the French translation L'Alcoran de Mahomet, initially published in 1649. Edition dating to 1719. The earliest known translation of the Qur\u02bban in any European language was the Latin works by Robert of Ketton at the behest of the Abbot of Cluny in c. 1143. This translation remained the only one until 1649 when the first English language translation was done by Alexander Ross, chaplain to King Charles I, who translated from a French work L'Alcoran de Mahomet by du Ryer. In 1734, George Sale produced the first translation of the Qur\u02bban direct from Arabic into English but reflecting his missionary stance. Since then, there have been English translations by the clergyman John Medows Rodwell in 1861, and Edward Henry Palmer in 1880, both showing in their works a number of mistakes of mistranslation and misinterpretation, which brings into question their primary aim. These were followed by Richard Bell in 1937 and Arthur John Arberry in the 1950s. The Qur\u02bban (1910) by Dr. Mirza Abul Fazl (1865\u20131956), a native of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), later moved to Allahabad, India. He was the first Muslim to present a translation of the Qur\u02bban into English along with the original Arabic text. Among the contemporary Muslim scholars, Dr. Abul Fazl was a pioneer who took interest in the study of the chronological order of the Qur\u02bban and drew the attention of Muslim scholars to its importance. With the increasing population of English-speaking Muslims around the start of the 20th century, three Muslim translations of the Qur\u02bban into English made their first appearance. The first was Muhammad Ali's 1917 translation, which is composed from an Ahmadiyya perspective, with some small parts being rejected as unorthodox interpretation by vast majority of Muslims. This was followed in 1930 by the English convert to Islam Marmaduke Pickthall's more literalist translation. Soon thereafter in 1934, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, a Bohra Ismaili, published his translation, featuring copious explanatory annotation \u2013 over 6000 notes, generally being around 95% of the text on a given page, to supplement the main text of the translation. This translation has gone through over 30 printings by several different publishing houses, and is one of the most popular amongst English-speaking Muslims, alongside the Pickthall and Saudi-sponsored Hilali-Khan translations. With few new English translations over the 1950\u20131980 period, these three Muslim translations were to flourish and cement reputations that were to ensure their survival into the 21st century, finding favour among readers often in newly revised updated editions. Orientalist Arthur Arberry's 1955 translation and native Iraqi Jew N. J. Dawood's unorthodox translation in 1956 were to be the only major works to appear in the post-war period. A. J. Arberry's The Koran Interpreted remains the scholarly standard for English translations, and is widely used by academics. The English translation of Kanzul Iman is called The Treasure of Faith, which is translated by Farid Ul Haq. It is in simple, easy-to- understand modern-day English. Explanations are given in brackets to avoid ambiguity, provide better understanding and references to similar verses elsewhere. Dr. Syed Abdul Latif's translation published in 1967, regarded highly by some. He was a professor of English at Osmania University, Hyderabad. It was nevertheless short-lived due to criticism of his foregoing accuracy for the price of fluency. The Message of the Qur\u02bban: Presented in Perspective (1974) was published by Hashim Amir Ali. He translated the Qur\u02bban into English and arranged it according to chronological order. Dr. Hashim Amir-Ali (1903-c. 1987) was a native of Salar Jung, Hyderabad State in the Deccan Plateau. In 1938, he came under the influence of Dr. Abul Fazl and took a deep interest in the study of the Qur\u02bban and was aware of the significance of the chronological order of the passages contained in it. Another Jewish convert to Islam, Muhammad Asad's monumental work The Message of The Qur'an made its appearance for the first time in 1980. Professor Ahmed Ali's Al- Qur\u02bban: A Contemporary Translation (Akrash Publishing, Karachi, 1984, Reprinted by Oxford University Press, Delhi, 1987; Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 1988, with 9th reprinting 2001). Fazlur Rahman Malik of the University of Chicago writes, \"It brings out the original rhythms of the Qur\u02bbanic language and the cadences. It also departs from traditional translations in that it gives more refined and differentiated shades of important concepts\". According to Francis Edward Peters of New York University, \"Ahmed Ali's work is clear, direct, and elegant \u2013 a combination of stylistic virtues almost never found in translations of the Qur\u02bban. His is the best I have read\". At the cusp of the 1980s, the 1973 oil crisis, the Iranian Revolution, the Nation of Islam and a new wave of cold-war generated Muslim immigrants to Europe and North America brought Islam squarely into the public limelight for the first time in Western Europe and North America. This resulted in a wave of translations as Western publishers tried to capitalize on the new demand for English translations of the Qur\u02bban. Oxford University Press and Penguin Books were all to release editions at this time, as did indeed the Saudi Government, which came out with its own re-tooled version of the original Yusuf Ali translation. Canadian Muslim Professor T. B. Irving's 'modern English' translation (1985) was a major Muslim effort during that time. Qur\u02bban: The Final Testament, Islamic Productions, Tucson, Arizona, (1989) was published by Rashad Khalifa (; 19 November 1935 \u2013 31 January 1990) Khalifa wrote that he was a messenger of God and that the archangel Gabriel 'most assertively' told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Qur\u02bban, 'specifically' referred to him.Appendix ii, (21), Authorized English Translation of the Qur\u02bban, Dr. Rashad Khalifa, PhD He is referred to as God's Messenger of the Covenant by his followers. He wrote that the Qur\u02bban contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19. He made the controversial claim that the last two verses of chapter nine in the Qur\u02bban were not canonical, telling his followers to reject them.\u2033The idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Qur\u02bban by adding 2 false verses (9:128\u2013129).\u2033 His reasoning was that the verses, disrupted an otherwise flawless nineteen-based pattern and were sacrilegious inasmuch as they appeared to endorse worship of Muhammad. Khalifa's research received little attention in the West. In 1980, Martin Gardner mentioned it in Scientific American.Gardner, Martin (1980), Mathematical Games, Scientific American, September 1980, pp16\u201320. Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.The numerology of Dr. Rashad Khalifa \u2013 scientist, Martin Gardner, Skeptical Inquirer, Sept\u2013Oct 1997 The arrival of the 1990s ushered in the phenomenon of an extensive English-speaking Muslim population well-settled in Western Europe and North America. As a result, several major Muslim translations emerged to meet the ensuing demand. One of them was published in 1990, and it is by the first woman to translate the Qur\u02bban into English, Amatul Rahman Omar, together with her husband, Abdul Mannan Omar.Amatul Rahman Omar \u2013 The First Woman to Translate the Qur\u02bban into English In 1991 appeared an English translation under the title: The Clarion Call Of The Eternal Qur-aan, by Muhammad Khalilur Rahman (b. 1906\u20131988), Dhaka, Bangladesh. He was the eldest son of Shamsul Ulama Moulana Muhammad Ishaque of Burdwan, West Bengal, India, \u2013 a former lecturer of Dhaka University. In 1996 the Saudi government financed a new translation \"the Hilali-Khan Qur\u02bban\" which was distributed free worldwide by the Saudi government. It has been criticised for being in line with their particular interpretation. The Saheeh International Qur\u02bban translation was published in 1997 in Sa'udi Arabia by three women converts. It remains extremely popular. In 1999 a fresh translation of the Qur\u02bban into English entitled The Noble Qur\u02bban \u2013 A New Rendering of its Meaning in English by Abdalhaqq and the American Aisha Bewley was published by Bookwork, with revised editions being published in 2005 and 2011. The Qur\u02bban in Persian and English (Bilingual Edition, 2001) features an English translation by the Iranian poet and author Tahereh Saffarzadeh. This was the third translation of the Qur\u02bban into English by a woman, after Amatul Rahman Omar,Amatul Rahman Omar, \"The Holy Qur\u02bban \u2013 English\", The Holy Qur\u02bban \u2013 English, 1990. and Aisha Bewley \u2013 and the first bilingual translation of the Qur\u02bban.Saffarzadeh Commemoration Due Iran Daily, 18 October 2010Art News in Brief Tehran Times, 28 October 2008 In 2003, the English translation of the 8-volume Ma'ariful Qur'an was completed and the translation of the Qur\u02bban used for it was newly done by Muhammad Taqi Usmani in collaboration with his brother Wali Raazi Usmani and his teachers, Professors Hasan Askari and Muhammad Shameem. In 2004 a new translation of the Qur\u02bban by Muhammad Abdel-Haleem was also published, with revised editions being published in 2005 and 2008. In 2007, Qur\u02bban: a Reformist Translation by Edip Y\u00fcksel, Layth Saleh al-Shaiban, and Martha Schulte-Nafeh, was published. In 2007, The Meanings of the Noble Qur\u02bban with Explanatory Notes by Muhammad Taqi Usmani was published. It has been published in 2 volumes at first and later, in a single volume. He also translated the Qur\u02bban in simple Urdu, making him a translator of the Qur\u02bban in dual languages. In 2007 The Sublime Qur\u02bban appeared by Laleh Bakhtiar; it is the second translation of the Qur\u02bban by an American woman. In 2009, Wahiduddin Khan translated the Qur\u02bban in English, which was published by Goodword Books entitled The Qur\u02bban: Translation and Commentary with Parallel Arabic Text. This translation is considered as the most easy to understand due to simple and modern English. The pocket size version of this translation with only English text is widely distributed as part of dawah work. A rhymed verse edition of the entire Qur\u02bban rendered in English by Thomas McElwain in 2010 includes rhymed commentary under the hardback title The Beloved and I, Volume Five, and the paperback title The Beloved and I: Contemplations on the Qur\u02bban. In 2015 Dr. Mustafa Khattab of Al-Azhar University completed The Clear Qur\u02bban: A Thematic English Translation, after three years of collaboration with a team of scholars, editors, and proof-readers. Noted for its clarity, accuracy, and flow, this work is believed to be the first English translation done in Canada. A Turkish Scholar Hakk\u0131 Y\u0131lmaz worked on the Qur\u02bban through the root meanings of the Arabic words and published a study called Tebyin-\u00fcl Qur\u02bban, and he also published a Division by Division Interpretation in the Order of Revelation in Turkish. His work was translated into English. In 2018, Dr Musharraf Hussain released The Infallible word of Allah, a reader-friendly presentation of the translation of the Qur\u02bban aiming to help readers understand the topic being read, and learn the moving and transformative message of the Qur\u02bban. There are 1500 sections with headings. === Asian languages === Mir Sayyid Ali, writing a tafsir on the Qur\u02bban during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. ==== Sindhi ==== Akhund Azaz Allah Muttalawi (Urdu: \u0622\u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0623\u0639\u0632\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647) was a Muslim theologian from Sindh. Akhund Azaz is considered to be the first person who translated the Qur\u02bban from the Arabic to the Sindhi. According to Sindhi tradition the first translation was made by in 270 AH / 883 CE by an Arab scholar. later it was translated in Sindhi language by Imam Abul Hassan bin Mohammad Sadiq Al-Sindhi Al-Ma ==== Urdu ==== First Urdu translation of Qur\u02bban was done by Shah Abdul Qadir, who was the son of Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlawi.

Abbas Ali of Candipur, West Bengal was the first Muslim to translate the entire Qur\u02bban into the Bengali language. It is also said that Mohammad Noymuddin of Tangail translated the first ten chapters of the Qur\u02bban into Bengali.Sazzadur Rahman, Chayanir Publication, Tangail, Bangladesh Besides many translated Qur\u02bbanic exegesis are available in Bengali language.

This translation in Khwarazm Turkish, like other translations of the Qur'an, is important for language studies. Because the sanctity of the text that is subject to translation will cause the translator to behave more carefully, the errors encountered in the text are not included in such works. In addition, attention was paid to the religious terminology to be understood by the public and that is why Turkish words are given weight.A.

The translation does not consider hadith and sectarian jurisprudence as authority in understanding the Qur\u02bban. It differs greatly from Sunni and Shia traditions in translation of numerous crucial words and verses. Hakk\u0131 Y\u0131lmaz worked on the Qur\u02bban through the root meanings of the Arabic words and published a study called Tebyin-\u00fcl Qur\u02bban. And he also published a Division by Division Interpretation in the Order of Revelation. ==== Hebrew ==== 2019 - translation of the quran to hebrew, by oz yona and his staff. published by Goodword books. ==== Japanese ==== The first translation into Japanese was done by Sakamoto Ken-ichi in 1920. Sakamoto worked from Rodwell's English translation. Takahashi Goro, Bunpachiro (Ahmad) Ariga and Mizuho Yamaguchi produced Japan's second translation in 1938. The first translation from the Arabic was done by Toshihiko Izutsu in 1945. In 1950, another translation appeared by Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa. Other translations have appeared more recently by Ban Yasunari and Osamu Ikeda in 1970 and by Umar Ryoichi Mita in 1972. ==== Chinese ==== It is claimed that Yusuf Ma Dexin (1794\u20131874) is the first translator of the Qur\u02bban into Chinese. However, the first complete translations into Chinese did not appear until 1927, although Islam had been present in China since the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). Wang Jingzhai was one of the first Chinese Muslims to translate the Qur\u02bban. His translation, the G\u01d4l\u00e1nj\u012bng y\u00ecji\u011b, appeared in either 1927Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, pg. 298. London: A & C Black, 2013. or 1932, with new revised versions being issued in 1943 and 1946.
