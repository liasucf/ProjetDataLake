She went on to have a long career, including as a consultant at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital. ==Biography== Isabella Macdonald Macdonald was born in 1856, daughter of John Brown, the town-clerk of Arbroath. She was an early student of the London School of Medicine for Women, established to provide a route by which women could acquire the credentials necessary to become a registered physician in the UK. She graduated in 1888 as a doctor of medicine and pharmacist. She practiced initially, for three years, as the resident physician at Cama Hospital, Mumbai, returning to the UK with ill-health. Thereafter she worked for many years at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, rising to the level of consultant physician and retiring in 1925. She maintained a private practice operating from her house in Seymour Street, Portman Square until 1940, when the property was destroyed as the result of a wartime bombing. She died, aged 91, in 1947. ==References== Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:English women medical doctors Category:Alumni of the London School of Medicine for Women Category:Women of the Victorian era Category:1856 births Category:1947 deaths Category:19th-century women physicians ",
