    "text": "The Tipulomorpha are an infraorder of Nematocera, containing the crane flies, a very large group, and allied families. One recent classification based largely on fossils splits this group into a series of extinct superfamilies (below), and includes members of other infraorders, but this has not gained wide acceptance. ==Extinct ranks== *Superfamily Eopolyneuroidea **Family Eopolyneuridae - (Upper Triassic) **Family Musidoromimidae - (Upper Triassic) *Superfamily Tipulodictyoidea extinct **Family Tipulodictyidae - (Upper Triassic) *Superfamily Tanyderophryneoidea extinct **Family Tanyderophryneidae - (Middle Jurassic) *Superfamily Tipuloidea **Family Architipulidae extinct (Upper Triassic)-(Pan Jurassic) **Family Eolimnobiidae extinct (Lower Jurassic) *Superfamily Eoptychopteroidea extinct **Family Eoptychopteridae - (Lower Jurassic) == External links == * Tree of Life Tipulomorpha Category:Insect infraorders ",
