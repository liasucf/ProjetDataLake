People of this village are mostly farmers, mainly cultivating paddy, corn and cotton. == History == Once upon a time in a dense forest a sage called Sri Pankaj Maha Muni lived and he used to offer prayers to the Shiva Lingam every night. There are inscriptions on the temple pillar which substantiates the story. As the time rolled by, the sage died and the Shiva Lingam that he worshipped was covered under the nests of ants. Some years later, a farmer by name Chinthakunta Odelu was tilling his land. His plough suddenly struck the Shivalingam. He took it out and constructed a temple around it. There are sub-shrines in the temple for Lord Sri Rama and village deities Bangaru Pochamma and Madana Pochamma temples. On the southern side of the temple is Sri Bramarambha Mata; on the northern side is Sri Veerabhadra Swamy; on the western side of the temple is Veera Shaiva Mattam; on the westernside there is big banyan tree known as Matta Marri. Lord Shri Bhairava Swamy is seen here as Kshetra Palaka. On the northeastern side of the temple there are idols of Lord Shiva in the form of Shri Khandiswara Swamy and that of two local ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, Medala Devi and Ketamma.
