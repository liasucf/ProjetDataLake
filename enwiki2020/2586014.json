Electrically powered trains have been operating through the station since March 2015, using Class 319 EMUs. ==History== The oldest passenger station in the world was Crown Street railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester passenger railway opening on 17 September 1830. The trains set out on the first day at the Liverpool end. The second station on the line was the original Edge Hill railway station, the third was Broad Green station. In 1836 Crown Street station was demolished and Edge Hill decommissioned. A new Edge Hill station opened to the north of the original station in the grounds of the Edge Hill junction. This leaves Broad Green station as the oldest used railway station in the world. The current station buildings are not originalhttp://www.8dassociation.btck.co.uk/Stations/TheLM dating from 1972. About to the east of the station the abandoned North Liverpool Extension Line passes under the lines, which is currently part of the Trans Pennine Trail.OpenStreetMap ==Facilities== The ticket office is located on the Liverpool-bound platform (platform 1) and like most Merseytravel-sponsored stations is manned throughout the hours of service, seven days per week. A waiting shelter is provided on platform 2 and there are digital display screens and customer help points provided on both sides. The platforms are linked by a subway with steps, but level access is available to both sides via nearby streets.Broad Green station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 11 January 2017 Merseytravel announced in April 2019 that they had been successful in a bid for funding lifts being installed at the station under the Department for Transport's \u2018Access for All\u2019 programme.
