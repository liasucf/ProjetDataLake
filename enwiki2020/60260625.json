    "text": "The Park Theater is an indoor amphitheater on the grounds of the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Opening in December 2016, the theater primarily hosts concerts and residencies and is the second largest theater on the Las Vegas Strip. The theater sits adjacent to the T-Mobile Arena and Toshiba Plaza. ==Description== The theater was announced in July 2015, as part of the mass redevelopment of the aging Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. Spearheaded by MGM Resorts International and AEG, construction began November 2, 2015 on the \"MGM Resorts Theater\" (later known as the \"MCR Concert Hall\" before settling on its current name) at the site of the former Lance Burton Theatre. After one year of construction, the $90 million theatre opened on December 17, 2016, with a concert by Stevie Nicks. The theater boasts a capacity of 6,400 (5,200 for residency shows), making it the second largest theater on the Strip behind the Zappos Theater. The venue is 150,000 square feet with a 135'x40' stage and 7,500 square foot proscenium arch. The theatre was designed ensuring the back row was only 145 feet from the stage. It also includes an 80'x40' 4K-LED screen. ==Performance history== ===Headliners=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Performer ! style=\"width:180px;\"|Show ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Length |- |Bruno Mars |Bruno Mars at Park Theater at Park MGM |2016\u20132020 |- |Lady Gaga |Enigma |2018\u20132020 |- |Aerosmith |Deuces Are Wild |2019\u2013present |- |Janet Jackson |Metamorphosis |May-August 2019 |- |Ricky Martin |All In |2017-18 |- |Cher |Classic Cher |2017\u2013Present |- |Jonas Brothers |Jonas Brothers in Vegas |Cancelled |- |Stevie Wonder |Steve Wonder's Song Party: A Celebration of Life, Love & Music |August 2018 |- |Queen + Adam Lambert |Crown Jewels |September 2018 |- |Britney Spears |Domination |TBA |- |} ===Concerts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |- ! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Performer(s) ! style=\"width:190px;\"|Show/Tour |- |December 17, 2016 |Stevie Nicks |24 Karat Gold Tour |- |December 24, 2016 |Fish Leong | |- |December 25, 2016 |Mansour Arash |Arash and Mansour: Live in Concert |- |January 29, 2017 |Richie Jen Steve Wong Edmond Leung William So | |- |March 25, 2017 |Il Volo |Notte Magica: A Tribute to the Three Tenors |- |April 2, 2017 |Russell Dickerson Chris Janson Tracy Lawrence RaeLynn Clay Walker |ACM Awards Official After Party |- |April 21, 2017 |Hans Zimmer |Revealed |- |April 28, 2017 |Brett Eldredge | |- |June 9, 2017 |The Doobie Brothers Chicago |2017 North American Tour |- |June 17, 2017 |Boston |Hyperspace Tour |- |July 21, 2017 |Kenny Rogers |The Gambler's Last Deal |- |July 22, 2017 |Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie |Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie: Live in Concert |- |September 9, 2017 |Jonathan Lee | |- |September 30, 2017 |DMX Eve The Lox Swizz Beatz Drag-On |Ruff Ryders Reunion: 20th Anniversary Tour |- |January 12, 2018 |rowspan=\"2\"|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons |rowspan=\"2\"|A Special Evening with Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons |- |January 13, 2018 |- |February 24, 2018 |Kadim Al-Saher Najwa Karam | |- |February 25, 2018 |G-Eazy |Beautiful & Damned Tour |- |March 10, 2018 |311 |rowspan=\"2\" |- |April 7, 2018 |Gloria Trevi Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n |- |June 22, 2018 |Post Malone |Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour |- |July 21, 2018 |Logic |Booby Tarantino vs Everybody Tour |- |October 5, 2018 |Dropkick Murphys |Fall Tour 2018 |- |October 13, 2018 |Sting Shaggy |44/876 Tour |- |October 27, 2018 |rowspan=\"3\"|Widespread Panic |rowspan=\"4\" |- |October 28, 2018 |- |October 29, 2018 |- |November 24, 2018 |Rene Liu |- |December 5, 2018 |Thirty Seconds to Mars Bishop Briggs Robert DeLong Grandson The Crystal Method |Holiday Havoc |- |December 15, 2018 |Kane Brown |Live Forever Tour |- |July 19, 2019 |Beck Cage the Elephant |Night is Running Tour |- |July 20, 2019 |Why Don't We |8 Letters Tour |- |} ==References== Category:2016 establishments in Nevada Category:Music venues completed in 2016 Category:Buildings and structures in Paradise, Nevada Category:Park MGM Category:Music venues in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Theatres in Nevada ",
