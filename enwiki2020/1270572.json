    "text": "The Khmer numerals depicted in four different typographical variants comparing to Arabic numerals (blue). Khmer numerals are the numerals used in the Khmer language. They have been in use since at least the early 7th century, with the earliest known use being on a stele dated to AD 604 found in Prasat Bayang, Cambodia, near Angkor Borei. == Numerals == The number 605 in Khmer numerals, from the Sambor inscriptions in 683 AD. The earliest known material use of zero as a decimal figure. Having been derived from the Hindu numerals, modern Khmer numerals also represent a decimal positional notation system. It is the script with the first extant material evidence of zero as a numerical figure, dating its use back to the seventh century, two centuries before its certain use in India. However, Old Khmer, or Angkorian Khmer, also possessed separate symbols for the numbers 10, 20, and 100. Each multiple of 20 or 100 would require an additional stroke over the character, so the number 47 was constructed using the 20 symbol with an additional upper stroke, followed by the symbol for number 7. This inconsistency with its decimal system suggests that spoken Angkorian Khmer used a vigesimal system. As both Thai and Lao scripts are derived from Old Khmer, their modern forms still bear many resemblances to the latter, demonstrated in the following table: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !

For example, 6 () is formed from 5 () plus 1 (). === Numbers from 0 to 5 === With the exception of the number 0, which stems from Sanskrit, the etymology of the Khmer numbers from 1 to 5 is of proto-Mon\u2013Khmer origin. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

However, in Cambodia, taking a picture with three people in it is considered bad luck, as it is believed that the person situated in the middle will die an early death. === Numbers from 6 to 20 === As mentioned above, the numbers from 6 to 9 may be constructed by adding any number between 1 and 4 to the base number 5 (), so that 7 is literally constructed as 5 plus 2. Beyond that, Khmer uses a decimal base, so that 14 is constructed as 10 plus 4, rather than 2 times 5 plus 4; and 16 is constructed as 10+5+1. Colloquially, compound numbers from eleven to nineteen may be formed using the word preceded by any number from one to nine, so that 15 is constructed as , instead of the standard . {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

It is likely that Khmer has borrowed them from the Thai language, as the numbers are both non-productive in Khmer (i.e. their use is restricted and cannot be used outside 30 to 90) and bear a near one-to-one phonological correspondence as can be observed in the language comparisons table below. Informally, a speaker may choose to omit the final and the number is still understood. For example, it is possible to say () instead of the full (). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Value ! Khmer !

In order to avoid confusion, sometimes is used to mean ten million, along with for one hundred million, and (\"one thousand million\") to mean one billion. Different Cambodian dialects may also employ different base number constructions to form greater numbers above one thousand.

Generally speaking, asides a few exceptions such as the numbers for 0 and 100 for which the Khmer language has no equivalent, they are more often restricted to literary, religious, and historical texts than they are used in day to day conversations. One reason for the decline of these numbers is that a Khmer nationalism movement, which emerged in the 1960s, attempted to remove all words of Sanskrit and Pali origin. The Khmer Rouge also attempted to cleanse the language by removing all words which were considered politically incorrect. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Value ! Khmer ! Word form ! IPA ! UNGEGN !

Unlike modern Khmer, the decimal system was highly limited, with both the numbers for ten and one hundred being borrowed from the Chinese and Sanskrit languages respectively. Angkorian Khmer also used Sanskrit numbers for recording dates, sometimes mixing them with Khmer originals, a practice which has persisted until the last century. The numbers for twenty, forty, and four hundred may be followed by multiplying numbers, with additional digits added on at the end, so that 27 is constructed as twenty-one-seven, or 20\u00d71+7. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

By comparing both modern Khmer and Angkorian Khmer numbers to those of other Eastern Mon\u2013Khmer (or Khmero-Vietic) languages such as Pearic, Proto-Viet\u2013Muong, Katuic, and Bahnaric; it is possible to establish the following reconstructions for Proto-Khmer. === Numbers from 5 to 10 === Contrary to later forms of the Khmer numbers, Proto-Khmer possessed a single decimal number system. The numbers from one to five correspond to both the modern Khmer language and the proposed Mon\u2013Khmer language, while the numbers from six to nine do not possess any modern remnants, with the number ten *kraaj (or *kraay) corresponding to the modern number for one hundred. It is likely that the initial *k, found in the numbers from six to ten, is a prefix. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Value ! Khmer ! Reconstruction !
