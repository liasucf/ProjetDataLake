    "text": "There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown is the ninth prime-time animated TV specials based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. This marks the on-screen debut of Marcie, who first appeared on the comic strip in 1971. It was originally aired on the CBS network on March 11, 1973. The special was released to DVD as a bonus feature (along with another Peanuts special Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown) on January 2, 2004. It was also released in remastered form as part of the DVD box set, Peanuts 1970's Collection, Volume One. ==Plot== There are three months of school left and all of the Peanuts gang are under pressure from too many tests and homework assignments. They now have to make preparations to write a report on a field trip to an art museum. Charlie Brown's grades are falling from A to C and he has to receive a big grade on his museum report in order to salvage his grades for the entire term. Simultaneously, he must fight off the distraction of Peppermint Patty and her classmate Marcie (in her animated debut), both of whom have feelings for him. Unfortunately, on the way to the art museum, Charlie Brown, his sister Sally, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Snoopy inadvertently arrive in a supermarket and mistake it for the art museum. When Linus shows Charlie Brown and Lucy slides that resemble the works he took pictures of, Charlie Brown's hopes of salvaging his grades are shattered. As he waits for his graded report, he expects the worst of it all. However, everything works out for the best, as his teacher assumes his report is a description of an art museum described through the metaphor of a supermarket and she gives him the grade he needs. Peppermint Patty later apologizes to Charlie Brown for saying bad things to him and that it was not easy for a girl to talk like that to a boy. But Peppermint Patty angrily blows Charlie Brown away after Charlie Brown brings up the Little Red-Haired Girl. Marcie, who was watching this and calling her 'sir' throughout the special, reminded Peppermint Patty that she said the wrong thing again like she did in the supermarket. Peppermint Patty then asks Marcie if she knows how annoying it is being called 'sir' a lot when she tells her not to. Marcie responds, \"No, ma'am\". ==Cast and characters== * Chad Webber as Charlie Brown * Stephen Shea as Linus van Pelt * Robin Kohn as Lucy van Pelt * Hilary Momberger as Sally Brown * James Ahrens as Marcie * Todd Barbee as Franklin * Christopher DeFaria as Peppermint Patty * Bill Mel\u00e9ndez as Snoopy Violet, Patty, and Frieda made cameo appearances but they are silent. ==Music score== The music score for ' was composed by Vince Guaraldi and conducted and arranged by John Scott Trotter.
