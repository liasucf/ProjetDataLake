The resulting scandal and trial that began in 1999 and ended in 2000. It has been described as one of the largest scandals ever in South Korea since the 1990s. Estimated loss from bribery and corruption related to the Furgate scandal was approximately $165 million. ==History== The scandal surfaced in South Korea in May 1999 while prosecutors were investigating corruption charges related to the Shin Dong Ah company. Luxury items were used by wives of businessmen under investigation for corruption to gain favors of the wives of senior Korean politicians and judicial officials, in order to have those wives persuade their husbands towards leniency. The investigation into the scandal led to the first ever appointment of a special prosecutor in South Korea judicial history. Two ministers resigned over the scandal; a former Minister of Justice and a former presidential legal secretary were among the individuals arrested during the investigation. Individuals sentenced in the scandal included the wives of a former unification minister and of a former prosecutor general, found guilty of perjury before the Korean parliament (National Assembly). ==Impact== The scandal was revealed in the midst of the Korean economic crisis related to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and led to moral outrage. The scandal damaged the reputation of Korean president Kim Dae-jung and his party (the Democratic Party), particularly when further information was revealed to suggest that the prosecutor office attempted to cover up the scandal. ==References== Category:1999 crimes in South Korea Category:1999 scandals Category:Corruption in South Korea Category:Kim Dae-jung Category:Political scandals in South Korea Category:May 1999 events in Asia ",
