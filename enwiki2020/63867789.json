    "text": "Soul, or Dzhan, (Borrowed from Persian: \u062c\u0627\u0646\u200e (or j\u00e2n, \u201cmeaning soul, vital spirit, dear life\u201d), in Russian: \u0414\u0436\u0430\u043d (\u0438\u043b\u0438 \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\") was completed in 1935 by Andrey Platonov as a result of his second trip to the Turkmen Republic. Although the Soviet state in the 1930s censored Dzhan, and only published selected chapters, the uncensored text was finally published in full in 1999. Shortly after in 2008, New York Review Books Classics issued a collection of Platonov's works translated into English by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler, Katia Grigoruk, Angela Livingstone, Olga Meerson, and Eric Naiman that included the novella Soul (Dzhan), the short story The Return, and six other stories. Soul, or Dzhan, could be read as a \u201ctypical socialist realist novel of the Stalinist era,\u201d yet it contains elements that separate it from this categorization. In summary, it is the story of how Nazar Chagataev, a \u201cnon- Russian\u201d economist from Central Asia, leaves Moscow and goes to bring socialism to his people called the Dzhan, a lost, nomadic nation made up of rejects and outcasts that possess nothing but their souls. Upon reaching the Dzhan, Chagataev realizes that he can do nothing to help the nation yet embarks on a perilous journey with them through the desert to the mountains before returning to Moscow at the end of the story. The majority of the story narrates the perilous migration of the Dzhan nation from the Sary-Kamysh delta through the Kara-Kum desert to the Ust-Yurt Mountains. Geography plays an important role in this novella especially given the fact that Platonov as a Russian writer was an \u201coutsider\u201d in Central Asia writing from the perspective of an \u201cinsider.\u201d The story takes place during the 1930s at the end of the national delimitation process that occurred in Central Asia from 1924-1936 that resulted in the formation of the Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkmen, and Uzbek SSRs. Today the novel\u2019s references to these specific geographical landmarks exist within the nations of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan respectively. == Plot summary == The narrative starts with Nazar Chagataev\u2019s graduation from the Moscow Institute of Economics. In the courtyard, he meets a woman named Vera and goes home with her that night. At her home, he sees an interesting diptych on her wall and learns that Vera is pregnant, but the father of the child is dead. He immediately fosters a strange connection to Vera and to her young daughter, Ksenya. After frequent visits, he decides marry Vera, but then leaves after the summer to go to his posting to \u201cbring socialism\u201d to his people and assist the Dzhan nation into a better life. He sets off on a long journey by train across the steppe, by boat down the Amu- Darya, and finally reaches the Dzhan nation living in a delta called Sary- Kamysh. He meets Sufyan, Molla Cherkezov, Aidym and Gyulchatay, but his mother, Gyulchatay, does not seem to remember him. He sees that they are a sad, destitute nation living in a miserable state with very few possessions and little strength to live. He returns briefly to Chimgay for supplies, and there he receives a letter from Ksenya stating that Vera and the baby have died. Although the news gives him sorrow, he decides that he must carry on his mission with the Dzhan. He returns to them and has a discussion with Nur- Mohammed who has been sent by the district executive committee to keep track of and assist the Dzhan. Although Nur-Mohammed has no hope in the nation, Chagataev decides they must migrate to a better location, hoping that this move with result in better living conditions for the group. During this slow migration across the Kara-Kum sands, the group struggles to find sustenance and follows a fold of wandering sheep in hopes for food and direction. Some members of the nation die in the unforgiving sands. Chagataev slowly separates from the group as he falls behind and nearly dies from exhaustion and starvation. As he approaches death, he fights off two giant birds attacking him, shooting them with a pistol, and collapses into unconsciousness. Meanwhile, Nur-Mohammed stays with the group and in an act of desperation, intentionally separates from the group with Aidym. During a strange rape scene involving Nur-Mohammed, Aidym sees the giant birds fly overhead and hears the shots of Chagataev\u2019s gun. She goes immediately to him and sees him unconscious. Aidym quickly tries to comfort Nazar and restore his health. By this time, Nur-Mohammed comes back and once again tries to steal Aidym and take her to Afghanistan. Nazar tries to stop him and they get into a fight. The fight ends as Nazar shoots Nur-Mohammaed in the legs, and he runs off in to the sands never to be seen again. After this scene, the nation has lost a few members, their spirits are low, and they decide to eat the giant birds that Nazar killed. They rest for some days, then continue onward to the Ust- Yurt Mountains. However, once they reach the mountains, only Nazar and Aidym work to keep a small group of sheep, build a small dwelling, and restore the health the remaining members. They work together to build adobe houses and properly settle in the Ust-Yurt Mountains. However, soon after their health is restored many of the members disperse in all directions before the winter. Nazar stays the winter, then goes to Khiva and other cities to look for them. Chagataev decides that he must secure the well-being of the Dzhan nation and then return to Moscow. He meets another outcast, a young girl named Khanom, and he fosters an interesting relationship with her. They share some nights together, and he tells her to stay in the chaikhana until he returns. Nazar goes to Chardzhou where he meets Sufyan. They continue around other cities such as Ashgabat, Bairam-Ali and Merv until he decides to return to Khiva, collect Khanom and go back to the mountains. When he returns, the owners of the chaikhana tell him that Khanom left to go look for him. He takes off quickly to the Ust-Yurt Mountains to see Aidym once more. When he arrives, he sees that Khanom has made her way there along with other members of the nation. She has decided to stay and marry Molla Cherkezov. There is now a sufficient fold of sheep and other mud dwellings. Chagataev stays until the end of summer, but ultimately realizes that he is no longer needed. At the end of his stay, he advises the Dzhan to elect Khanom as the new leader. After everything seems in place, Nazar decides to take Aidym to school in Moscow and they both leave the Ust-Yurt Mountains and take the long journey. When they return to Moscow, Ksenya and Aidym become friends. Ksenya helps Aidym adjust to the city life by taking her to the bathhouse, helping her get clothes and teaching her things about the city. The story ends as Ksenya and Nazar hold hands, and Nazar realizes that help can only come from others, not from himself. == Main characters == Nazar Chagataev \u2013 His mother is Gyulchatay and his father was Ivan Chagataev, a Russian soldier in Khiva.

The plot and characters of Dzhan seem to follow certain trajectories and exhibit the desire to add to socialist values of a Soviet society, yet they ultimately fall short. Thus, Platonov is unable to fit the mandated socialist realist framework, which results in the partial and delayed publication of this particular work. In Dzhan, Platonov initially exhibits orientalist similarities in his texts through his depictions of Central Asian territory as useful, vast, and transformable, and Central Asia people as miserable, poor, and backwards. During his two trips to Central Asia, Platonov kept a record of his travels through is notes as well as writes letters to his wife and son while on the trip to Central Asia. Through these notes and letters, we can also see his attempts to describe \u201cthe Turkmen\u201d people as well as his efforts to make sense of his territorial surroundings in an orientalist fashion through his intentions to remake the society and transform the territory. Scholars have noted how Platonov attempts to reflect his own reality through Soviet subjectivity in other works such as \u201cAmong Animals and Plants\u201d and Happy Moscow. However, through the literary work of Dzhan, Platonov also illustrates Soviet subjectivity through his attempts to depict the \u201cSoviet soul\u201d within collective existence, his vision of ascent and enlightenment, his complicated understanding of narodnost\u2019, his descriptions of homeless or abridged \u201cSoviet people,\u201d and his creation of \u201cinsider characters\u201d in a region for which he is an \u201coutsider.\u201d == Reception == Although Platonov repeatedly mentions Stalin throughout Dzhan in a fatherly and glorified way, Platonov\u2019s vision and textual expression did not align with the personal views of Stalin or the mandates of the Soviet state in the 1930s. Scholars such as Chandler, Deathridge, Skakov, and Seifrid comment on the tumultuous relationship between Platonov and Stalin and the ways in which his coded language allowed him to survive the Great Terror of the 1930s. However, despite narrowly escaping trial and potential exile, Platonov\u2019s textual representation of the \u201cSoviet soul\u201d and \u201csocialist reality\u201d set him directly against Stalin and Soviet Union seeking to categorize and sort \u201csouls\u201d that fit into their idea of the Soviet project. During the 1930s, Andrey Platonov had many problems publishing his work. With the novella Dzhan, it was the same case. Platonov\u2019s inability to fit the socialist realist model, his inclusion of graphic content, and his conflicting definitions of a \u201cSoviet soul\u201d ultimately resulted in the censorship of the novella. Although \u201cbrief extracts\u201d from the first three chapters did appear in Literaturnaia Gazeta in 1938 and previous editions with \u201cnumerous omissions\u201d were published from the 1960s to the 1990s, the \u201cuncensored text\u201d of Dzhan was not fully published until 1999. In 2008, New York Review Books Classics issued a collection of Platonov's works translated into English that included the novella Soul (Dzhan), the short story The Return, and six other stories. Soul (Dzhan) was translated by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler and Olga Meerson with Jane Chamberlain and Eric Naiman. This novel is available for purchase on various online bookstores. == English translation == Platonov, Andrey Platonovich, and Robert Chandler. Soul and Other Stories.
