    "text": "Boris Herrmann (born 26 May 1981) is a German yachtsman. == Sailing career == In 2001 Boris Herrmann was the youngest (and only German) participant in the Mini Transat race, a single-handed yacht race across the Atlantic. He came to finish eleventh which earned him his first larger appearance in the yachting press. In 2006 Herrmann finished second in the European Championship as well as in the German Championship in the 505 class. In spring 2008 Herrmann sailed his Class 40 yacht \u201cBeluga Racer\u201d to a second in the Artemis Transat, the oldest transatlantic regatta for single-handed yachts. Boris Herrmann won the Portim\u00e3o Global Ocean Race, a five leg regatta around the world for Class 40 boats. He and his co-skipper Felix Oehme (the Beluga Offshore Sailing Team) came to win three of the five legs of the race, and left behind the team Desafio Cabo de Hornos. This makes them the first German professional team on a German yacht to win a leg of an international trans-ocean race and the whole race itself. On 29 July 2019, it was announced that Boris Herrmann was to sail climate activist Greta Thunberg from Plymouth to New York City in mid-late August 2019 on his emission-free racing yacht Malizia II. They departed on 14 August 2019 and arrived on 28 August the same year. == References == == Sources == * Article at Seglermagazin.de Artemis Transat 2008: Boris Herrmann sensationell Zweiter 30.
