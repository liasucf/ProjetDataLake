    "text": "Leng Tch'e is a Belgian grindcore band. The band describes their style as \"razorgrind\", a combination of grindcore with death metal, stoner rock and metalcore. The band's name is an alternate romanisation of \"l\u00edngch\u00ed\", a method of torture and execution originating from Imperial China that is also known as \"death by a thousand cuts\". Death by a Thousand Cuts is also the name of one of the band's albums. ==Biography== Leng Tch'e drummer Sven is Aborted frontman Gurgloroth 'Svencho' Sven De Caluw\u00e9. The band began life under the billing of Anal Torture, forged by Sven and Dark Ages guitarist Glen along with vocalist Isaac and bass player Kevin in early 2002. Leng Tch'e signed to the Italian Spew label for the opening 2002 album Death by a Thousand Cuts. After that album, the band released a split 7\" single with Black Ops. The band would employ Israeli guitarist Nir 'The Goat' Doliner of Lehavoth, even undertaking gigs in Israel opening for Amon Amarth. Unable to secure a bassist Nicolas would switch from guitar to cover this role. Eventually the distance factor for Doliner prevented a full-time role. In early 2004 therefore the band inducted Geert as second guitarist. The band enrolled former Pyaemia bassist Frank Rizzo as guitarist in late 2003. Meantime, Isaac fired up a Noise side project billed as Permanent Death whilst vocalist Sven De Caluw\u00e9 would front In-Quest for an album. The band's second album, ManMadePredator, would be scheduled for May 2003 release. Leng Tch'e proposed split releases in 2004 with Fuck...I'm Dead for No Escape Records and a split 7\" single with Gronibard on Bones Brigade Records. Guitarist Rizzo decamped in August, being replaced in November by Jan of Spleen. In early 2005 the band inducted Boris of Suppository as new frontman, debuting this revised line-up at the 30th April 'Face Your Underground' festival in Antwerp. Leng Tch'e contracted to Relapse Records in March, scheduling a summer release date for new album The Process of Elimination. The band played May US East Coast dates along with Impaled, Malignancy and Aborted. The band partnered with Fuck the Facts and Beneath the Massacre for a Canadian tour in 2006. On March 9, 2007, a new album, Marasmus, was released on Relapse Records. Some commentators noted that the album was closer to the deathcore sound.Cosmo Lee, Metal Injection, March 19, 2007.
