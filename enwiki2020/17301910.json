    "text": "Rabia Sorda is the side project of Erk Aicrag, lead singer of the Mexican aggrotech band Hocico. Rabia Sorda, like Hocico, is electronic music, though it is somewhat less aggressive and noisy than Hocico. While his main project, Hocico, goes down a certain path, Aicrag uses Rabia Sorda as a vehicle for his own musical creativity. He mixes different aspects ranging from ethnic influences to 1980s-style melodies and punky attitude to aggressive electronic music. == Discography == === Albums === *M\u00e9todos del Caos (2006) *Noise Diary (2009) *The Art of Killing Silence (2012) *Hotel Suicide (2013) *The World Ends Today (2018) ===EPs=== *Save Me from My Curse (2006) *Radio Paranoia (2009) *Animales Salvajes (2014) *King of the Wasteland (2016) ===Singles=== *Eye M the Blacksheep (2012) *Erk Aicrag with Tristesse de la Lune: Eiskalte Liebe (2002)http://www.discogs.com/Tristesse-De-La-Lune-Eiskalte- Liebe/release/437338 ==External links== * Rabia Sorda homepage * Out of Line Records homepage == References == * Band's web site * Record label's web site Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Electro-industrial music groups Category:Mexican electronic musicians ",
