Also in 1958, Giles made a memorable arrival at the film premiere of Teacher's Pet, starring Clark Gable, by arriving in a furry pink Cadillac convertible. Her appearance brought her career considerable publicity, including a two\u2013page article and spread in Life Magazine, titled \"The Blond From Hooker \u2013 How to Become a Movie Star\", in which she was photographed in a bubble bath. Her other film roles included Black Spurs in 1965, Flareup in 1969, and Black Gunn in 1972, as well as television credits ranging from Columbo to Land of the Giants.
