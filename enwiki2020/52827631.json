    "text": "Trino Cruz Seruya (born 1960) is a Gibraltarian poet. == Biography == Born in Gibraltar in 1960. Of mixed Sephardi, English, Italian and Spanish ancestry, he studied in Liverpool and London before returning to his birthplace in 1983. He has been called a main example of the Spanish-language poetry both in Gibraltar and in the wider scope of the territories circling the Strait of the same name. Commentator of Maghrebian poetry, he has also translated works by authors such as Hassan Najmi and Saadi Yousef. One of the defining traits of his literary work is miscegenation. Trino Cruz has given the opinion that \"Gibraltarian literature is a literature nonata\" (not yet born), attributing that status to political forces blocking the \"creative instincts\". == Works == A list of published compilations of poems authored by Cruz follows: * Lecturas del espacio profanado (Sevilla, 1992) * Breve antolog\u00eda. Colecci\u00f3n Cuadernos del Aula de Literatura Jos\u00e9 Cadalso, n\u00fam. 19. (San Roque, 1993) * Como la mirada que ha de pervertir este espejo.
