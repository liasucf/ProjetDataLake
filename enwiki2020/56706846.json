    "text": "\"Monster\" is a song from the 2018 Broadway musical Frozen, an adaptation of the 2013 Disney animated film of the same name. Sung by Elsa, the song takes place during the second act. The song was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. == Development == \"Monster\" contains an allusion to Dies Irae. The song was released on YouTube Vevo with a music video the same day the show opened on Broadway. This track was performed at New York City's Gotham Hall, and is the first of four original songs from the musical to be released weekly through the Disney on Broadway channel (the Anna and Kristof duet \"What Do You Know About Love?\", the Elsa solo \"Dangerous to Dream\", and the Anna solo \"True Love\"). == Context == The soliloquy ballad sees Elsa ask herself if she is evil due to her magical abilities, and wonders if the world would be better without her. She first attempts this by running away to a far- off place and building an ice tower (\"Let It Go\"). When a winter is triggered regardless, she considers more extreme measures. This song takes place after Elsa has just thrown Anna and Kristoff out of the ice palace, as Hans and his men from Arendelle arrive to capture her. She thinks about the damage she has caused, while she is buried under her self-doubt, fear, and uncertainty. == Critical reception == The Telegraph felt that the song \"allows the audience to better understand her motivations\" at this point in the story. Mashable deemed the piece an \"earworm\", while Digital Spy described the song as \"pure Elsa\". == References == Category:2010s ballads Category:2018 songs Category:Songs about monsters Category:Songs from musicals Category:Disney songs Category:Songs from Frozen (franchise) Category:Songs written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez Category:Songs written by Robert Lopez ",
