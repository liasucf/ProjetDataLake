    "text": "Scaffold web spiders (Nesticidae) is a family of araneomorph spiders closely allied with tangle web spiders. Like the \"Theridiidae\", these spiders have a comb of serrated bristles on the hind tarsi that are used to pull silk bands from the spinnerets. It contains 16 genera and about 300 species, many of which are associated with caves or overhangs. The genus Nesticus is the type for the family and is found throughout the world. The related Eidmannella has speciated considerably in Texas caves and includes some extremely localized species that are considered threatened. One species, Eidmannella pallida, is found in caves and under overhangs, but also in agricultural fields and other habitats away from such restricted areas. The genus Carpathonesticus is found in central Eurasia. ==Genera== , the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera: *Aituaria Esyunin & Efimik, 1998 \u2014 Ukraine, Russia, Georgia *Canarionesticus Wunderlich, 1992 \u2014 Canary Is. *Carpathonesticus Lehtinen & Saaristo, 1980 \u2014 Europe, Asia *Cyclocarcina Komatsu, 1942 \u2014 Japan *Domitius Ribera, 2018 \u2014 Spain, Portugal, Italy *Eidmannella Roewer, 1935 \u2014 North America, Spain, Japan *Gaucelmus Keyserling, 1884 \u2014 Mexico, Central America, Jamaica *Hamus Ballarin & Li, 2015 \u2014 Tibet *Kryptonesticus Pavlek & Ribera, 2017 \u2014 Europe, New Zealand *Nescina Ballarin & Li, 2015 \u2014 China *Nesticella Lehtinen & Saaristo, 1980 \u2014 Asia, Africa, Oceania, Brazil *Nesticus Thorell, 1869 \u2014 Asia, Africa, Cuba, North America, South America, Europe *Pseudonesticus Liu & Li, 2013 \u2014 China *Speleoticus Ballarin & Li, 2016 \u2014 China, Japan *Typhlonesticus Kulczy\u0144ski, 1914 \u2014 Europe *Wraios Ballarin & Li, 2015 \u2014 China The following extinct genera have been placed in the Nesticidae: *\u2020Balticonesticus Wunderlich, 1986 \u2013 Palaeogene, Baltic amber *\u2020Eopopino Petrunkevitch, 1942 \u2013 Palaeogene, Baltic and Bitterfeld amber *\u2020Heteronesticus Wunderlich, 1986 \u2013 Palaeogene, Baltic amber *\u2020Hispanonesticus Wunderlich, 1986 \u2013 Neogene, Dominican amber == See also == * List of Nesticidae species == References == * Category:Araneomorphae families ",
