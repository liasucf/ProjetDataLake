    "text": "Berga Kulle Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in S\u00f6dermanland County in Sweden. It is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network. The nature reserve consists of a rocky plateau or hill and its surroundings. Large patches of bedrock dominate the hill, where Scots pine grow, often in the form of krummholz.(some specimen are as old as 250 to 300 years). In the south-western part of the nature reserve, moraine characterises the geology, and here the pine trees grow taller and stronger. Towards the north, spruce instead dominate the forest. The whole area also has plenty of coarse woody debris, which is beneficial for the area's biodiversity. The forest is rich in mosses and lichens, and the protection of the moss Buxbaumia viridis is one of the explicit aims of the nature reserve. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in S\u00f6dermanland County Category:Geography of S\u00f6dermanland County Category:Protected areas established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Sweden Category:Natura 2000 in Sweden ",
