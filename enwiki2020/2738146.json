It is located on the European shore of the Bosporus, between Be\u015fikta\u015f and Ortak\u00f6y in Istanbul, Turkey. The Sultan\u2019s Suite, billed at per night, is ranked number 14 on World's 15 most expensive hotel suites compiled by CNN Go in 2012.Arnold, Helen CNN Go. 25 March 2012. Retrieved 2014-10-09 == History == The palace, built by Sultan Abdulaziz, was designed by the Armenian palace architect Nigo\u011fayos Balyan and constructed by his sons Sarkis and Hagop Balyan between 1863 and 1867, during a period in which all Ottoman sultans built their own palaces rather than using those of their ancestors; \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace is the last example of this tradition. The inner walls and the roof were made of wood, the outer walls of colorful marble. A beautiful marble bridge connects the palace to the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace on the hill behind. A very high garden wall protects the palace from the outer world. The construction and the interior decoration of the palace continued until 1872. Sultan Abdulaziz did not live long in his magnificent palace - he was found dead inside on 30 May 1876, shortly after he was dethroned. His successor, his nephew Sultan Murad V, moved into \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace, but reigned for only 93 days. He was deposed by his brother Abdul Hamid II due to alleged mental illness and lived there under house arrest until his death on 29 August 1904 On November 14, 1909, during the Second Constitutional Monarchy, Sultan Mehmed V allowed the Ottoman Parliament to hold their meetings in this building. Only two months later, on January 19, 1910, a great fire destroyed the palace, leaving only the outer walls intact. Called \"\u015eeref Stad\u0131\", for many years its garden served as a football field for the club Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.. In 1987, the ruined palace was bought by a Japanese corporation, which restored the palace and added a modern hotel complex next to it in its garden. The modern hotel building was opened in 1990 and the restored palace building was opened in 1992. Today, it serves as luxury suites for the five-star Kempinski hotel along with two restaurants that cater to guests. The Palace was renovated again during the first quarter of 2007, now resembling the authentic palace with the baroque style and soft colors.
