    "text": "Hagar in the Wilderness is an early 19th century painting by French artist Camille Corot. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts the biblical figure Hagar as she wanders through the wilderness of Beersheba. Specifically, the painting renders the moment in which Hagar and her newborn son Ishmael experience divine salvation, seen via Corot's inclusion of an angel in the back center of the painting. Much of the landscape seen the work is derived from Corot's earlier nature studies. Hagar is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == References == Category:1835 paintings Category:Paintings by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art ",
