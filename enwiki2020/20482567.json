    "text": "Aegopinella nitidula (previously known as Retinella nitidula) is a species of small land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Gastrodontidae, the glass snails. Forsyth et al. (2001) reviews its identification and ecology. ==Description== For terms see gastropod shell. Shell The shell is amber reddish in colour, rarely whitish. It is milky white near the umbilicus. The shell is finely striated with spiral lines producing a fine reticular pattern (less prominent than in A. pura). The apex is strongly convex with 3.5-4.5 convex and regularly increasing whorls. The last whorl is not inflated near the aperture and not descending. The aperture is slightly oblique and the umbilicus is wide. The animal is bluish grey with a lighter sole and bluish black upper tentacles.Animalbase (Welter-Schultes) == Distribution == This species occurs in these countries amongst others: * Czech Republic * UkraineBalashov I. & Gural-Sverlova N. 2012.
