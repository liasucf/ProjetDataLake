She is convinced that her father, Jack Winston (John Savage), murdered her mother (Kiva Dawson). In a quest for vengeance, Samantha uncovers an evil and devastating truth. Samantha tried to escape tragedy much of her life. After her young mother's sudden passing, when Samantha was only 8 yrs old, she went to live with her aunt in Minnesota. Within one year her world was shattered again when her aunt was killed in a car crash. Young Samantha was then sent to live with abusive foster families, and finally she ran off to live on her own at age 16. Returning to her childhood home as a young adult conjures up loving memories of her life as a child. However, harsh reminders of her father's drunken rampages and the sudden death of her 32-year-old mother dominate her thoughts. She is convinced that her father, 20 years her mother's senior, a jealous and verbally abusive alcoholic, committed this unthinkable crime. In the exhaustive search for evidence Samantha seeks answers from Lucas Drake (Steven Bauer), her mother's best friend and a successful funeral director and mortuary owner, and her Uncle Thomas (Edward Furlong), among others. As the deep dark secrets of evil plots and schemes in this town unfold, the mystery thickens. ==Cast== *Julianne Michelle as Samantha Winston *Steven Bauer as Lucas Drake *John Savage as Jack Winston *Edward Furlong as Thomas Burton *Stelio Savante as Benny Dawson *Sally Kirkland as Harriet Bendi *Bryan Dechart as Liam Dawson *Sean Stone as Man in Fedora Hat *Joycelyn Engle as Dr. Rockwell *Kiva Dawson as Jennifer Winston *Erin Gerasimovich as Young Samantha *Andrea Kubala as Aunt Patricia ==Production== ==Reception== ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" | Award / Film festival ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=row | 168 Film Festival, US (2013) | Best Film (Best Narrated Feature) | Joycelyn Engle | | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- ! scope=row |LA Femme Film Festival (2013) | Best Feature Producer | Joycelyn Engle and Julianne Michelle | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=row | LA Femme International Film Festival (2013) | LA Femme Filmmaker Award | Joycelyn Engle | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=row | NYC Independent Film Festival (2013) | Best Feature Narrative | Joycelyn Engle | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=row | NYC Independent Film Festival (2013) | Best Actress | Julianne Michelle | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:English-language films Category:2013 thriller drama films Category:2013 drama films ",
