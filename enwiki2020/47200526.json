    "text": "Pierre Senges (born 1968, Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re) is a French writer. His work includes sixteen books, numerous essays published in literary journals, and over twenty-five plays for radio. His books are sometimes noted for having a baroque prose style. They frequently combine erudition and invention (Fragments of Lichtenberg, The Major Refutation) or play on the relation between historically true and fictional elements (Les carnets de Gordon McGuffin and Essais fragiles d\u2019aplomb). Senges' radio plays (fictions radiophoniques) have been produced by France Culture and France Inter. His many prizes include the Prix Wepler, the Prix SACD Nouveau Talent Radio in 2007, the Grand prix de la fiction radiophonique de la SGDL in 2008, the Prix du deuxi\u00e8me roman, the Prix Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, and the Prix meilleure page 111. ==Works== === Books === * Veuves au maquillage, \u00c9ditions Verticales, 2000 ; Points Seuil.
