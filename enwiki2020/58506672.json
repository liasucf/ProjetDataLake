    "text": "The Palais The Palais des Beaux-Arts de Li\u00e8ge is a building at the centre of the Parc de la Boverie in the Belgian city of Li\u00e8ge. It was designed by Charles \u00c9tienne Soubre and Jean-Laurent Hasse and is the only building constructed for the Li\u00e8ge International in 1905 which was not demolished at the end of the event. The event's organising committee left it to the city and it became the 'Palais des F\u00eates et des Expositions', hosting conferences, balls, banquets, salons and major exhibitions such as the exhibition on the COBRA movement in 1951. The city's prints and drawings collection and the Walloon artistic collection from the city's Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts were both housed in the building from 1952 onwards. The Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts' main site in an annexe of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Li\u00e8ge on rue des Anglais was destroyed in the 1970s and so all its modern and contemporary art collections were moved into the Palais, which was renamed the Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne. The Walloon art was moved out in 1980 to a complex in the F\u00e9ronstr\u00e9e et Hors-Ch\u00e2teau district designed by Henri Bonhomme. The Palais underwent a major renovation from 1988 onwards, reinstating the open space from the original 1905 design. It reopened in 1993 as the Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain (MAMAC). At the end of 2011 the mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts was revived in the Bonhomme building as part of a plan to combine MAMAC, the 'Fonds ancien' collection, the prints and drawings and the museum of Walloon art into a single entity named Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Li\u00e8ge or BAL (Beaux-Arts Li\u00e8ge), housed in the former Walloon art galleries. On 28 February 2016 the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts closed and the whole collection was moved to a new museum housed in the Palais, named La Boverie. ==References== category:Buildings and structures in Li\u00e8ge Category:World's fair architecture in Belgium ",
