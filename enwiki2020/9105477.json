    "text": "Grand vin of 2006 Ch\u00e2teau du Tertre, or Le Tertre, is a winery in the Margaux appellation of the Bordeaux region of France, in the commune of Arsac. The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui\u00e8mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. == History == Located on the tertre (French for \"hillock\" or \"rising ground\") from which it takes its name, the ancient origins of Ch\u00e2teau du Tertre are traced back to the Seigneurie d'Arsac documented as early as 1143 whose descendants owned the estate in the 16th century. Le Tertre passed through the ownership of the Arr\u00e9rac family and Marquis de S\u00e9gur until the 1855 classification. When the estate was owned by Charles Henri, Le Tertre hold a good reputation and was in demand on the Dutch market. It was sold to Henri de Koenigswarter in 1870 under whose ownership Le Tertre's reputation increased further. By World War II the reputation and production had diminished, but in 1961 Ch\u00e2teau du Tertre was acquired by Philippe Gasqueton, who restored the vineyards and ch\u00e2teau with the backing of Belgian business partners. Following Gasqueton's death in 1995 his widow sold the property to Eric and Louise Albada Jelgersma, owners of the neighbouring estate Ch\u00e2teau Giscours. In 1997, Eric Albada Jelgersma bought the estate and invested in the large-scale overall restructuring, thus returning its former noble personality to the Chateau du Tertre. == Production == From an 80 hectare estate, the vineyard area extends approximately 50 hectares consisting of the grape varieties of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, with vines averaging about 35 years. == References == * MacNeil, Karen (2001).
