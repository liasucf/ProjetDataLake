After a spell in Turkey with Akhisar Belediyespor, Djoum signed for Polish club Lech Pozna\u0144 in early 2015. Djoum then joined Heart of Midlothian in September 2015. He scored his first goal for the club in a narrow 2\u20131 loss to rivals Celtic in October 2015. After settling in he very quickly became a star man in Robbie Neilson's team.
