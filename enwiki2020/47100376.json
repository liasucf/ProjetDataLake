    "text": "Casco Art Institute: Working for the Commons is a non-profit public art institution based in Utrecht, Netherlands. == Overview == Casco was founded in 1990 as an experimental art space on the Oudegracht in Utrecht. In 1995 it was renamed Casco Projects, starting a program with a focus on autonomy and intervention. In 2003, Casco took a new title 'Office for Art, Design and Theory' to expand its framework to artistic research and interdisciplinary practices. In 2007, the institute moved to a new location on the Nieuwekade, designed by ifau (institute for applied urbanism) and Jesko Fezer. In 2014 Casco moved to a new space on the Lange Nieuwstraat in Utrecht. 2018 marked another transitional year accompanied by the name change to Casco Art Institute: Working for the Commons. == Past Projects == *2018 Elephants in The Room: Assembly for commoning institutions *2018 Biannual exhibition program: Alma Heikkil\u00e4, \"Evolved in shared relationships\" and The Outsiders \"Erfgoed (Agricultural Heritage and Land Use)\" *2017 Doria Gar\u00eda and Ingo Niermann \"Army of Love\", and Heman Chong and Ren\u00e9e Staal, \"The Library of Unread Books\" *2016 Alex Martinis Roe, \"To Become Two\" *2016 Wok The Rock, \"Parasite Lottery\" *2015 Group Exhibition: \"We Are the Time Machines: Time and Tools for Commoning\" *2015 Adelita Husni-Bey, \"White Paper: The Law\" and Fernano Garc\u00eca- Dory, \"INLAND\" *2014 Melanie Gilligan, \"The Common Sense\" and The Otolith Group, \"In the Year of the Quiet Sun\" *2014 Wendelien van Oldenborgh receives prestigious Dr AH Heiniken Prize for Art *2014 Inaugural Exhibition, \"New Habits\" *2013 Tadasu Takamine, \"Japan Syndrome - Utrecht Version\" *2012 Lawrence Abu Hamdan, \"Aural Contract: The Whole Truth\" *2009-2010 \"User's Manual: The Grand Domestic Revolution\", long-term \"living research\", *2010 Ei Arakawa, \"Hurt Locker Instruments\" *2010 Martha Rosler, \"If you Lived Here Still...\" *2009 Metahaven, \"Stadtstaadt.
