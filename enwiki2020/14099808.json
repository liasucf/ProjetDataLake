He is known for his political songs and for his activism in support of buskers. He is one of the organizers of Buskerfest in Seattle. He frequently appears with Artis the Spoonman. He tours internationally, yet he still plays at Pike Place Market as a street performer. Page began playing guitar at age 15. In 1974, his protest song and testimony convinced the Seattle City Council to drop the requirement that street performers have a permit to perform. == Notable work == Page is well known in coffee houses and folk clubs in Seattle and the northwest, as well as in Britain and Ireland, where he toured for several years. His best known songs include \"Fireside\", his first song, written in 1967, Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette\", an anti-nuclear weapons song from his 1976 album \"On the Street Again\", later covered by Moving Hearts and Christy Moore, \"On the Street Again\", \"Time Enough for Questions When the Killing's Done\", about the eternal quest for a 'man of honor', \"Cultus Bay Serenade\", \"Miles and Miles\", about the modernization of the San Francisco Bay Area, \"Anna Mae\", \"An Old Pair of Red Shoes\", and \"Gasworks Park\".
