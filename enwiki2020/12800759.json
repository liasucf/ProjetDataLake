    "text": "Ludger Beerbaum with A-Corrada at CSIYH* in Wiesbaden 2015 Ludger Beerbaum (born 26 August 1963 in Detmold, North Rhine-Westphalia) is an internationally successful German equestrian who competes in show jumping and has been ranked the No. 1 Show Jumper in the world by the FEI on multiple occasions. He is also a four-time Olympic Gold medalist team and individual. == Early life and competitive career == Beerbaum was born in Detmold, Germany. In school, he took Business Studies, but eventually gave it up for a career in show jumping. Beerbaum began riding on a Highland Pony at the age of 8. He had a very successful career as a young Rider which continued into his adulthood. His most notable accomplishments include winning 4 Olympic Golds (his first at age 25) and numerous European and World Championship medals. On Sunday 21 September 2008, at the Samsung Super League Final in Barcelona, Beerbaum was a member of the winning German Nations Cup team. He was awarded Leading Rider of the 2008 Super League, along with 50,000 CHF ($46,000). In the Final, he rode the nine-year-old Westphalian gelding, All Inclusive NRW to a double clear round, and was one of only two riders to do so, his teammate Marco Kutscher being the other. == Family == Ludger Beerbaum is the oldest of 4 children, his siblings being Ruth, Monika, and show jumper Markus Beerbaum. He is married to Arundell Davison, with whom he has two daughters (Cecilia Sophie and Mathilde). From his previous marriage, he has a son (Alexander). He is also brother-in-law to Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum. == Top horses == Ludger Beerbaum at the 2008 Olympics * Goldfever: 1991 chestnut Hanoverian stallion (by Grosso Z) * Classic Touch 1984 Bay (Holstein) Mare by Caletto II (GOLD Barcelona olympics 1992) * Ratina Z: 1982 bay Hanoverian mare (Ramiro Z x Alm\u00e9 Z) * Gladdys S: 1992 chestnut Westphalian mare (Grandeur x Apart) * PS Priamos: 1982 chestnut Westphalian gelding (Pilot x Direx) * Enorm: 1997 bay Hanoverian gelding (Escudo I x Calypso II) * Couleur Rubin: 1996 chestnut Oldenburg stallion (by Cordalme Z) * L'Espoir: 1996 chestnut Zangersheide gelding (by Landwind II) * All Inclusive: 1999 bay Westphalian gelding (Arpeggio x Phantom) == Doping offense == At the 2004 Olympic Games, Beerbaum and his mount, Goldfever, managed to finish with only 4 penalty points, helping Germany earn the team gold medal. However, following the competition, Goldfever tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. The International Equestrian Federation found Beerbaum guilty of breaking the rules, stripping both him and his German team of their medals, dropping Germany down to bronze. Beerbaum believed the substance to have been present in an ointment administered to the horse due to a skin irritation, and the FEI agreed that the substance provided no competitive advantage. However, in accordance with the rule, Beerbaum was disqualified. Germany\u2019s team gold medal was then given to the Americans and the silver to the Swedish show jumping team. The Germans, however, were still able to take the bronze medal, even without Goldfever\u2019s results. == Major achievements == === Olympic Games === * Team gold medal - 1988 Olympic Games Seoul: 17.25 penalties (The Freak) * Individual gold medal - 1992 Olympic Games Barcelona: 0 penalties (Classic Touch) * Team gold medal - 1996 Olympic Games Atlanta: 1.75 penalties (Ratina Z) * Team gold medal - 2000 Olympic Games Sydney: 15 penalties (Goldfever 3) * Disqualified, losing team gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games Athens\u2014See \"Doping Offense\" above (Goldfever 3) * Team bronze medal - 2016 Summer Olympics Rio: Casello === World Championships === * Team silver medal & 73rd Individually - 1990 World Equestrian Games, Stockholm, Sweden (Gazelle) * Team gold medal & 4th Individually - 1994 World Equestrian Games in The Hague, Netherlands (Ratina Z) *Team gold medal & 5th Individually - 1998 World Equestrian Games in Rome, Italy (P.S.
