All nine occupants aboard were killed in the crash. == Accident == According to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), the aircraft with registration RP-C2296, which had taken off from Dipolog Airport in Zamboanga del Norte at 1:40pm local time (UTC+8), was bound for Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila when it lost radar contact with air traffic control (ATC) at around 3.10pm, while flying 37 miles (60 km) south of Manila. Witnesses nearby reported that the aircraft trailed smoke before plummeting onto the ground. The aircraft crashed and bursted into flames at the privately owned Agojo Resort in Pansol, Calamba, Laguna near the foothills of Mount Makiling, killing all nine occupants aboard and injuring two others on the ground. Among the dead were a patient being transported and his wife. Debris from the aircraft landed in separate locations of the subdivision. A number of residential houses were destroyed in the blaze, and a nearby resort had a wall damaged in the fiery crash. The accident occurred during the country's monsoon season, when a small number of tourists visit Pansol's resorts compared to the dry season which ended in June. == Aftermath == Following another aircraft crash of an IAI Westwind II at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport just months after the accident, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) grounded the entire Lionair fleet while both crashes were still under investigation. == Investigation == The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and the Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board (AAIIB) were dispatched to the scene to investigate the accident. The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder, which was badly damaged, was retrieved from the crash site and was brought to Australia for analysis. The CAAP said that it has partial information to determine the cause, but would release its final report once the AAIIB has concluded its investigation. == References == == External links == * Category:2019 in the Philippines Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Philippines Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2019 Category:2019 disasters in the Philippines ",
