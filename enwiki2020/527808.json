    "text": "Tarbes (; Gascon: Tarba) is a commune in the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es department in the Occitanie region of southwestern France. It is the capital of Bigorre. It has been a commune since 1790. It was known as Turba or Tarba in Roman times.The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites:Turba Tarbes is part of the historical region of Gascony. Formerly of strong industrial tradition, Tarbes today tries to diversify its activities, particularly in aeronautics and high tech around the different zones of activities which are increasing. The recent development of and other regional specialties also shows a willingness to develop the agri-food industry thus justifying its nickname of \"market town\". Its 42,888 inhabitants are called Tarbaises and the Tarbais. It is the seat of the diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes. The 1st Parachute Hussar Regiment and 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment are stationed in Tarbes. ==Geography== ===Location=== Location of Tarbes in the Pyrenees The Pyrenees seen from Tarbes. Tarbes is a Pre-Pyrenees town within the rich agricultural plain of the river Adour, southwest of Toulouse, to the east of Bayonne, southwest of Auch and northeast of Lourdes. Tarbes is 1 hr 30 mins from the Atlantic Ocean, 2 hrs 50 mins from the Languedoc coast and 35 minutes from the nearest ski resorts. It is located at an average elevation of . To the south of Tarbes, along with the pilgrimage town of Lourdes, is the border with Spain. The Pyrenees mountains, lying along the border between France and Spain, can be seen from the town. ===Hydrography=== Tarbes is crossed to the east by the Adour river and to the west by the \u00c9chez and by the Gespe, a tributary which joins the \u00c9chez on the territory of the commune. ===Neighbouring communes=== Map of the commune of Tarbes and its adjacent communes ===Climate=== Tarbes features an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), with relatively hot summers, mild winters and abundant rainfall. Tarbes benefits from its privileged location in the area of the Adour, a milder microclimate than at Lourdes, from a higher altitude, and somewhat less rainy than in Pau, and sunnier. Summers are warm and often stormy, while spring is rainy and cool and autumn is mild and sunny. Winter, meanwhile, is less rigorous but can still hold some surprises. The lowest temperature was recorded in January 1985 with a temperature under shelter of . Conversely, there was a maximum temperature of in August 2003. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:right; font-size:95%;\" !width=\"140px\"| Location !! Sunshine !! Rain !! Snow !!

It was an important city of the Novempopulania. Gregory of Tours in the 6th century named Talvam vicum. In the Middle Ages it was called Tarb\u00e9 (1214), Tursa, Tarvia (1284) and also Tarbia. Not to be confused with the Tarbelli, whose capital was Dax. ===Legendary origin of the name=== Legend holds that the Queen of Ethiopia, Tarbis, proposed her love to Moses and that he refused. Inconsolable, she decided to leave her throne and hide her disappointment. After many wanderings, she arrived in Bigorre and built her home on the Adour to found the town of Tarbes, and its sister, on the banks of the Gave de Pau, arose as Lourdes. ==History== ===Antiquity=== Foundations of an old villa in the Ormeau quarter In the 3rd century BC, the foundations of Tarbes began to emerge, based on the testimonies of the exhumed remains which had been buried. By need for salt trade, merchants who were likely Aquitanians travelled across the Pyrenean foothills. To continue their journey, they had to use a ford in order to cross the Adour which descended from the mountain. It was more prudent to split the loads to cross the ford as a result of which a pause was necessary. The bottom of the valley was dominated by a sandy emergence which prompted people to settle there. Then, Tarba experienced a Roman colonisation and acquired ancient villas and large agricultural estates, found particularly in the Ormeau quarter. The existence of craft has been verified by the remains of the workshops of potters and weavers. The urban core, meanwhile, assumed the administrative functions and would have had an early Christian church in the 4th century. ===Middle Ages=== Map of the fiefs of Gascocony around 1150 In the 5th and 6th centuries, as a result of the barbarian invasions which swept in successive waves, the city shrank around the castrum, of which a remnant remains in the rear courtyard of the prefecture. In about 840 AD, the Vikings led a devastating raid following which the Bishop of Bigorre reported that the city Bigorre was beginning with the cathedral, named with originality, la S\u00e8de. At the end of the 12th century, the count of Bigorre settled in his castle of Tarbes, resulting with the court of justice being in his suite. Then, the capital of Bigorre received a Royal Seneschal. Two noble houses were founded in the 13th century, outside the walls, one the convent of the Cordeliers near Carr\u00e8re Longue, the other being that of the Carmelites in the vicinity of the Bourg Crab\u00e9. At the end of the medieval centuries, the city was composed of six separate fortified towns, juxtaposed and aligned on an east\u2013west axis, where the original core was ordered around the cathedral. There were thus la S\u00e8de, Carr\u00e8re, Maubourguet and Bourg Vieux flanked to the east of the Count's castle, with Bourg Neuf and Bourg Crab\u00e9 each surrounded by their own walls. During the Wars of Religion, in 1569, the troops of Jeanne d'Albret burned the cathedral, the convents and other churches as well as the bishopric. Despite the strategic destruction to try to defend Bourg Vieux, the inhabitants were massacred. ===Early Modern era=== In the 17th century, after the plague and the problems of housing people of war, Tarbes ensured its revival with the reconstruction of the Episcopal Palace in 1652 (today the office of the prefecture), the foundation of a third hospital in 1690 and two new convents (Capuchins and Ursulines). Irrigation of the land and the water power used by the craftsmen were produced by the system of canals derived from the Adour. The 18th century announced a growth of the population, and the development of agriculture, crafts and trade. The town expanded and new quarters appeared (such as the current Rue Mar\u00e9chal-Foch). Then, the Constituent Assembly, which included Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac (Deputy of Bigorre to the Estates-General), decided to undertake administrative reform and Tarbes benefitted by becoming capital of the department of the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. ===19th century=== The Gare de Tarbes, around 1900 Brauhauban market, around 1900 An old image of the arsenal ====Prerogatives of a chef-lieu==== From 1800, Tarbes became the chef-lieu and headquarters of a prefecture (an increase of its administrative role and its functions). In 1806, Napoleon I re-established the and Tarbes gave birth to the Anglo-Arabian horse breed. In 1859, Tarbes was connected to Paris by rail. ====Legacy==== In the 19th century, various legacies enrich the public spaces of Tarbes. In 1853, bequeathed to the city the eponymous garden, still unfinished. In 1877, a donation by the former Mayor Antoine Brauhauban was responsible for the construction of an imposing hall which bore his name (this building was destroyed in 1970 to establish outdoor parking). The end of the 19th century still saw the construction of the two fountains of Place Marcadieu, a legacy of the benefactor F\u00e9licit\u00e9e Duvignau. ====Industrial development==== After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871, General Verch\u00e8re de Reffye transformed the experimental workshop of Meudon (transferred by train to Tarbes) construction of an artillery workshop (called an arsenal by the people of Tarbes). Thus, Tarbes became an industrial and working-class town but also asserted its military vocation by the construction of the Larrey, Soult and Reffye quarters. ===20th century=== During World War I, Tarbes intensified its production of artillery by virtue of its geographical position in the back country. Marshal Foch, Commander-in-Chief of all allied armies, was born in Tarbes in 1851. During World War II, the Resistance was also part of the everyday life of the town of Tarbes, which was awarded the Croix de Guerre. After the return of peace, the industry diversified and there was an expansion of the population. Tarbes remained a city of strong military character. ===21st century=== Today, Tarbes has also become a university city and the main activities are now within the tertiary sector (services). In addition to its privileged geographical situation, less than an hour from the Pyrenees mountains, two hours from the Atlantic Ocean and three hours from the Mediterranean via the La Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne autoroute, the city offers a certain lifestyle and boasts a cultural life which is packed with clubs and sport. ===Heraldry=== ==Economy== Being farther away from Toulouse than other cities of Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Tarbes may appear to display greater economic independence. Also it often occupies the second place in the regional urban hierarchy. It maintains close relations with Aquitaine and, in particular, with Pau, a nearby town of the Pre-Pyrenees. ===Industry=== TARMAC and the fields around Ossun. Tarbes is the second industrial city of the region. this is particularly illustrated in the field of railway construction and aeronautics with the presence of nearby companies such as Alstom and Daher. Daher-Socata manufactures business and tourism aircraft there, including the TBM 850 and TB 20. Its headquarters and its main industrial site are located on the outskirts of the Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport in the canton of Ossun, south of Grand Tarbes, where its facilities are spread over , of which are covered surfaces. At the end of 2006, its strength stood at more than 1,050 people. Ossun, a neighbouring commune of the agglomeration, is also home to TARMAC, a company dedicated to the dismantling of aircraft for which it was necessary to construct an imposing building. The platform is, again, installed on the Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es airport area, and revolves around the three activities of storage, maintenance and deconstruction. Boostec, based in Bazet, collaborated with EADS-Astrium to build the Herschel space telescope, launched on 14 May 2009. ===Zones of activity=== In addition to the Aerospace Valley involving DeciElec, Socata/Daher, Pearl and Tarmac, Tarbes is developing several business parks. *The Park of the Pyrenees, located in Ibos, is equipped to host craft, industrial activities, services and offices. *The Bastillac University Park is dedicated to technological research. The Park of the Adour, in Semeac, is for industrial, commercial and the tertiary sector. *Cognac Park, on the road to Pau, is devoted to the craft and the tertiary sector. *The Ecoparck of Bord\u00e8res-sur-Echez is the subject of projects regarding energy production (biogas plant project, produced from biomass), the cold-intensive businesses (Pyrenean curing and the planned cooling platform of Dominque Sallaberry Logistics). ===University centre=== Tarbes also houses the second University centre of the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es with a University Institute of technology (IUT) and National School of Engineers of Tarbes (ENIT) having more than 5,000 students. ===Tourism=== The Tarbes\u2013Lourdes\u2013Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport is still the second of the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. Also in the town centre, the Rex Hotel, a designer hotel addressing a rather affluent clientele, and the arrival of brands such as H&M; and new places of leisure (, etc.) seem to attest to the attractiveness of the town. ===Agriculture=== Often presented as a \"market town\", Tarbes is home to important halls and market squares, allowing opportunities for local agriculture. Symbol of the local food industry, a Cooperative of including emerged at the heart of the Bastillac zone. ==Transport== ===Air=== The small Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport is situated from the town centre.

In 2011, the municipality of Tarbes was rewarded with the label \" @@@@\". ===Political trends and results=== The municipal history of Tarbes under the Fifth Republic was marked by several waves. In the elections of 1959, the outgoing Socialist mayor, Marcel Billi\u00e8res, was a victim of the resilience of the Communist Party but especially also the shift to the right, which managed to seize the city hall with the election of Paul Boyrie. He was comfortably re-elected in 1965 (58.4%) and 1971 (55.2%). However, his sudden death a few weeks before the 1977 elections caused confusion in the ranks of the outgoing majority. In this election, the Communist prevailed in the first round (50.6%), at the head of a list of union of the left. He was reelected in 1983 with 54.8% against Jean Journ\u00e9 (UDF-RPR), but took ill with a heart attack during the count. Raymond Erracarret (FCP) was elected mayor by the municipal council. The new councillor regained his chair in 1989 with 54.1% against Jean Journ\u00e9 (UDF-RPR), then with a reduced majority (51.3%) in 1995, against G\u00e9rard Tr\u00e9m\u00e8ge (UDF-RPR). 2001 then marked a brand new change: G\u00e9rard Tr\u00e9m\u00e8ge, after a merger of the lists of DL-UDF and RPR, became mayor with 50.1% of the vote (26 votes in advance). He was re-elected on 17 March 2008 under the UMP-Radical Party label \"Valoisien\" this time with 54.3% (1,705 votes ahead of Jean Glavany) and again on 23 March 2014, this time in the first round with 52.95% of the votes. ===List of mayors=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of mayors of Tarbes !

From the 21st century, the communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants have a census take place every year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years.At the beginning of the 21st century, the terms of census have been amended by Act No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002, called \"grassroots democracy law\" on the democracy of proximity and in particular Title V \"of census operations\", in order, after a power transition period from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with populations greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is carried out annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is included at the end of the same period of five years. The first post-legal population from 1999, and fitting in the new system which came into force on 1 January 2009, is the census of 2006.In the census table, by Wikipedia convention, the principle was retained for subsequent legal populations since 1999 not to display the census populations in the table corresponding to the year 2006, the first published legal population calculated according to the concepts defined in Decree No. 2003-485 of 5 June 2003, and the years corresponding to an exhaustive census survey for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and the years 2006, 2011, 2016, etc. For municipalities with more than 10,000, the latest legal population is published by INSEE for all municipalities. The population of the commune of Tarbes as of 1 January 2017 is 41,518 inhabitants, thus placing the commune as 12th of the Occitanie region. In 2017, the Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration de Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (86 communes, 123,588 inhabitants) was created which, regionally, ranks 8th in population. The urban unit (unit\u00e9 urbaine) has 76,822 inhabitants. It includes the more urbanised communes and those nearest to Tarbes, notably the communes of Aureilhan (7,745 inhabitants), Bord\u00e8res-sur-l'\u00c9chez (5,227 inhabitants), S\u00e9m\u00e9ac (4,926 inhabitants) and Barbazan-Debat (3,463 inhabitants). The urban area (aire urbaine) has 117,290 inhabitants (2017), and is the sixth of Occitanie behind Toulouse, Montpellier, Perpignan, N\u00eemes and B\u00e9ziers and ahead of Al\u00e8s, Montauban and Albi. The following table shows the 14 communes of the urban unit of Tarbes,Unit\u00e9 urbaine de Tarbes (65501), INSEE all of which are also members of the Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration de Tarbes-Lourdes- Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.Intercommunalit\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole de CA Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (200069300), INSEE {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Commune !Population (2017) |- |Tarbes | align=\"right\" |41,518 |- |Aureilhan | align=\"right\" |7,745 |- |Bord\u00e8res- sur-l'\u00c9chez | align=\"right\" |5,227 |- |S\u00e9m\u00e9ac | align=\"right\" |4,926 |- |Barbazan-Debat | align=\"right\" |3,463 |- |Odos | align=\"right\" |3,242 |- |Soues | align=\"right\" |3,061 |- |Orleix | align=\"right\" |2,127 |- |Laloub\u00e8re | align=\"right\" |1,883 |- |Horgues | align=\"right\" |1,198 |- |Bours | align=\"right\" |829 |- |Mom\u00e8res | align=\"right\" |759 |- |Sarrouilles | align=\"right\" |529 |- |Chis | align=\"right\" |315 |- |} ==Outstanding public buildings and places== ===Public buildings=== The city hall and the courthouse, classical buildings of the 19th century, adjoin the Rue Mar\u00e9chal- Foch. Built in 1907, it is denoted by its candid monumentality. It is surmounted by a bell tower and faces the Place Jean-Jaur\u00e8s enthroned with a statue of Danton. On the fa\u00e7ade, one can read the motto \"Concord, liberty, equality, fraternity, labour.\" The H\u00f4tel Brauhauban, an 18th-century mansion, is one of its annexes. Not far away, the Police headquarters occupies two mansions built on the north walls filled in the 18th century to give birth to the current Rue Georges-Clemenceau. The Academy of Inspection of Hautes- Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es occupies a former school, built at the end of the 19th century. In the La S\u00e8de quarter, the was housed in the old Episcopal Palace, rebuilt in the 17th century. Not far away, lies the old college of Tarbes which became the Lyc\u00e9e Imp\u00e9rial in 1853 and was renamed Lyc\u00e9e Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in 1911. The Council General of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es also has several buildings including the former seminary of priests of the 18th century. The departmental archives are housed in a remarkable building from 1936. Three places are devoted to the markets: The market hall and the Place Marcadieu, Brauhauban market hall and the Place du Foirail. Near the Brauhauban market hall is an Italian theatre, known as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s, which was built in 1885. ===Fountains and squares=== Fountain of the Quatre-Vall\u00e9es The city has many fountains. The Place Marcadieu and Place Verdun reproduce the same pattern: They each have two fountains spread at either ends and not in the middle. F\u00e9licit\u00e9e Duvignau initiated this peculiarity, in Place Marcadieu, by bequest wishing for the building of fountains at each end of this vast esplanade. This relates to an eponymous Baltard-type market hall building in 1883. Inaugurated in 1897, the monumental fountain of the Quatre-Vall\u00e9es, combining cast iron and sculpture, figures the valleys of Bagn\u00e8res, Aure, Argel\u00e8s and the plain of Tarbes. At the other end of the square, the more modest \"Source de l'amour\" [Source of love], presents an echo of the style. The Montaut fountain is set at the centre of this public space and was moved close to the square of the same name. Named after its donor, it is carved in stone by Nelli of the Pyrenees and was first erected in 1874. In 2008, the ensemble was further complemented by the construction of a nearby square planted with palm trees, in the north of its namesake Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Church. The Place de Verdun has fountains of a much more contemporary appearance. To the south, the Grande Fontaine [Great Fountain] forms a playful bell of water.

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Jean- Baptiste Verch\u00e8re de Reffye establishes, in the old store of tobacco in Tarbes, an artillery workshop commonly referred to as \"Arsenal\". It was used for military armament production until 2006. The site is today turning towards the tertiary sector. The old tobacco store houses the Municipal Archives and the Massey Museum reserves. In front stands the House of associations and its bell tower. The development of the Larrey, Soult and Reffye quarters saw the assertion of the military role of Tarbes in the 19th and 20th centuries. Several barracks were built. With regard to the Larrey barracks (1825), the majesty of the central building, long and flanked by two side buildings, is reinforced by the existence of an accessible courtyard from a portal framed by two pavilions of neoclassical inspiration. The ensemble is located in the axis of the Leclerc martial walkways which concentrate memorials including the monumental equestrian statue of Marshal Foch erected in 1935. is represented riding Marbor\u00e9, a horse owned by the Fould family.

Its industrial deterioration occurred following the 2003 announcement of the closure of the GIAT site, heir to the arsenal of 1871.
