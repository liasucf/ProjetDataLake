Commissioned late in the war, she was initially assigned to transport duties and consequently did not participate in combat operations. Crittenden was named after counties in Arkansas and Kentucky. Crittenden (APA-77) was launched 6 November 1944 by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; transferred to the Navy 16 January 1945; and commissioned the next day, Commander P. C. Crosley in command. ==Operational history== Sailing from San Diego 14 March 1945, Crittenden conducted training at Pearl Harbor until 24 May, then loaded troops and cargo at San Francisco for Okinawa, arriving 5 August. She survived a typhoon which struck the island. ===After hostilities=== She sailed 23 August for Manila, arriving 27 August, and from 15 September to 21 October carried occupation troops from Leyte to Wakayama and Mitsuyama, Japan, then returned to Okinawa 27 October. Assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, she made two voyages from Okinawa and Samar to San Francisco between 10 November 1945 and 24 January 1946. ===Operation Crossroads=== During Operation Crossroads Crittenden put out from San Pedro 16 February 1946 to join JTF-1 for Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. She was taken to Kwajalein 27 August 1946 and decommissioned the next day. She suffered radiation and shock wave damage from the test. After study, she was towed back to San Francisco on 1 January 1947 and sunk in an explosives test off the Farallone Islands on 6 October 1947. Her wreck became a fisheries habitat. ==References== *Crittenden (APA-77), DANFS Online. *APA-77 Crittenden, Navsource Online.
