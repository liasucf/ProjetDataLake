She has lived most of her life in New Orleans, and has been referred to as that city's unofficial poet laureate. At a young age, Grue fell in love with books and poetry, particularly The Golden Treasury by Louis Untermeyer, which featured female poets. Inspired by the poetry, Grue decided to become a poet herself. She received a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of New Orleans in 1963 and a Master of Fine Arts from Warren Wilson College in 1982. ==Career== In the early 1960s, Grue began reading her poetry at The Quorum Club, the first non-segregated coffee house in the South. During her time at the club, she met Eluard Burt, who she collaborated with over many years, including on the CD of jazz poetry titled Live! on Frenchmen Street. Ms. Grue founded the New Orleans Poetry Forum in 1972, where she was director until 1990. For many years she promoted poetry readings at her home, establishing there the Backyard Poetry Theater. Since 1982, she also has edited the international independent literary journal, The New Laurel Review which is still published today. Grue was a visiting writer at Tulane University from 1993 to 1998. Following Hurricane Katrina, she began teaching fiction and poetry at the Alvar Branch of the New Orleans Public Library. Grue is co-owner of BJ's Lounge in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans with her son, Teal Grue. The bar regularly hosts readings by local poets. ==Personal life== Lee Meitzen married Ronald David Grue on October 28, 1963, and they were divorced on September 5, 2000.
