    "text": "The Fire Inside is the fourteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Seger. The album was released in mid 1991 on the record label, Capitol. It was Seger's first album of entirely new music since Like a Rock in 1986. It features contributions from Joe Walsh, Bruce Hornsby, Roy Bittan, Steve Lukather, Don Was, Waddy Wachtel, Rick Vito, Mike Campbell, Patty Smyth, Lisa Germano, and Kenny Aronoff. On release, The Fire Inside received a mixed critical reception, but was still a commercial success peaking at number 7 on the US Billboard album chart, and achieved Platinum status from the R.I.A.A. ==Critical reception== Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Bret Adams wrote of the album \"Overall, the 12-track album is a disappointing piecemeal effort with five different production credits, and Seger uses two Tom Waits covers and one other outside song to pad it.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Bob Seger \u2013 electric guitar, rhythm guitar, vocals, choir, chorus, harmony vocals * Kenny Aronoff \u2013 drums * Sweet Pea Atkinson \u2013 background vocals * Eddie Bayers \u2013 drums * Barry Beckett \u2013 synthesizer * Roy Bittan \u2013 piano * Sir Harry Bowens \u2013 background vocals * Bobby Bruce \u2013 violin * Rosemary Butler \u2013 background vocals * Chris Campbell \u2013 bass * Mike Campbell \u2013 acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar, twelve-string guitar * Mimi Cooper \u2013 background vocals * Laura Creamer \u2013 background vocals * Thornetta Davis \u2013 background vocals * Craig Frost \u2013 organ, synthesizer, piano * Lisa Germano \u2013 violin * Donny Gerrard \u2013 background vocals, choir, chorus * Bob Glaub \u2013 bass * Richard Greene \u2013 violin * Richie Hayward \u2013 drums * Bruce Hornsby \u2013 piano, accordion * James Newton Howard \u2013 synclavier * Dann Huff \u2013 electric guitar, rhythm guitar * James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson \u2013 bass * John Jorgenson \u2013 slide guitar * Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums * Steve Lukather \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Donald Ray Mitchell \u2013 background vocals * Jamie Muhoberac \u2013 synthesizer * Shaun Murphy \u2013 background vocals, harmony vocals * Buell Neidlinger \u2013 acoustic bass * Dean Parks \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Bill Payne \u2013 piano * Don Potter \u2013 acoustic guitar * Alto Reed \u2013 baritone saxophone * Michael Rhodes \u2013 bass * Walt Richmond \u2013 piano * Patty Smyth \u2013 background vocals, choir, chorus, harmony vocals * J.
