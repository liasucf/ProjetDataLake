    "text": "Sodium trifluoroacetate is a chemical compound with a formula of CF3CO2Na. It is the sodium salt of trifluoroacetic acid. It is used as a source of trifluoromethylations. == Basicity == With the pKa of 0.23 for trifluoroacetic acid (compared to acetic acid, which has a pKa of 4.76), the trifluoroacetate ion is clearly a much weaker base. This is because of the electron-withdrawing effect on the 3 fluorine atoms adjacent to the carbon atom. With strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, the trifluoroacetate ion can be protonated: :CF3CO2- + HCl -> CF3CO2H + Cl- :CF3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CF3CO2H + HSO4- It also partially reacts with hydronium cations to form the acid: :CF3CO2- + H3O+ <=>> CF3CO2H + H2O The equilibrium is not complete because of the smaller pKa difference of the acid and hydronium. == Preparation == One convenient method is by dissolving an equivalent amount of sodium carbonate in 50% aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid. The solution is filtered and evaporated by vacuum evaporation (with special care to avoid decomposition of the salt by overheating). The solid obtained is dried under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C. == Uses == Sodium trifluoroacetate is a useful reagent for trifluoromethylation. :The trifluoromethylation process with sodium trifluoroacetate. == See also == * Sodium fluoroacetate * Trifluoroacetic acid * Sodium acetate == References == Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Trifluoroacetates ",
