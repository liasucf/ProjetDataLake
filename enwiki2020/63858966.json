    "text": "The maritime border dispute between Kenya and Somalia has escalated since the International Conference on Somali Oil and Gas and at the African Oil and Power Conference in Cape Town, South Africa in October 2019. The Somali Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Abdirashid Mohamed Ahmed declared the licensing bid round in respect of 15 blocks open for business despite ongoing the border dispute. ==International Court of Justice== In 2014 Somalia called on the International Court of Justice in The Hague to resolve the dispute. In October 2019 the ICJ postponed the hearing until 8 June 2020. ==Somali regional support for Kenya== The semi-autonomous Somali state of Jubaland which contains the entire Somali border with Kenya and 300 miles of coastline has expressed support for Kenya. == New Petroleum Law == In February 2020 the Somali government ratified a new petroleum law ahead of licensing round auctions unlocking Mogadishu's powers to potential sell oil blocks in the disputed region. == Shell and Exxon Mobil Production Sharing Agreement == In March 2020 the Somali government made an agreement with Shell and Exxon Mobil over five blocks it was awarded during the Siad Barre regime. Since Barre's overthrow in 1991 the blocks have been under force majeure. ==References== Category:Territorial disputes of Kenya Category:Territorial disputes of Somalia Category:Oil field disputes ",
