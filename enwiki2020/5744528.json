    "text": "\"Infinite Dreams\" is a live single released in 1989 by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It is the only single to be released in sync with a home video; 1989's Maiden England. The performance was recorded in Birmingham, England in 1988 towards the end of the massive world tour to support the album where the song originally appeared, being Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. It was the band's final single to feature The Trooper-era lineup for an entire decade until 2000's single The Wicker Man with guitarist Adrian Smith leaving the band in January 1990 after he did not approve of the direction the band were aiming for on their next album No Prayer for the Dying. ==Synopsis== The song is about how the character of the song sees disturbing visions about afterlife and other mystic things in his dreams, but is scared about if he will ever be able to wake up again. It starts with a soft guitar solo, which is then joined by Bruce Dickinson's singing as well as the rest of the band. The song starts out quite peaceful, but gets progressively heavier towards the song's climax and the following final verse. Steve Harris has explained, \u201cI do have nightmares, but usually only when we\u2019re writing an album. Then your mind just gets so overactive with all these ideas flying about inside that it\u2019s difficult to sleep. That\u2019s what \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019 is about.\u201d == Track listing == ;7\" Single ;12\" Single ==Personnel== Production credits are adapted from the 7 inch vinyl cover. ;Iron Maiden *Bruce Dickinson \u2013 lead vocals *Dave Murray \u2013 guitar *Adrian Smith \u2013 guitar *Steve Harris \u2013 bass guitar *Nicko McBrain \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians *Michael Kenney \u2013 keyboards ;Production *Martin Birch \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Derek Riggs \u2013 cover illustration *George Bodnar \u2013 photography ==Versions== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Songs !Country & Year !Catalog Number !Format |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI EMS 117 |Black Labels Single 7\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI EM 117 |Silver Labels Single 7\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) / Still Life (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI 12 EM 117 |Maxi Single 12\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) / Still Life (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI 12 EMP 117 |Maxi Single Poster Sleeve 12\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI EMP 117 | Shaped Picture Disc 7\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI EMP 117 |Uncut Picture Disc 12\" |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) / Still Life (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI CDEM 117 |CD Single |- |Infinite Dreams (Live) / Killers (Live) |UK 1989 |EMI TCM 117 |Cassette Single |} ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
