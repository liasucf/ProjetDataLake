She teamed up with Leander Paes from India for the mixed doubles at the US Open, triumphing over Liezel Huber and Jamie Murray in the finals. In 2009, she won five doubles titles leading to the year-end championships in Doha, Qatar. Black started 2010 strongly by winning two tournaments leading up to the 2010 Australian Open, coming to the slam with an unbeaten record. Black made it to the finals in both the women's doubles and mixed doubles. She and Huber lost the women's doubles final to Venus and Serena Williams in straight sets, 6\u20134, 6\u20133. However, she and Leander Paes won the mixed doubles in straight sets. The victory marked Black's first mixed doubles victory at the Australian Open. The victory also completed a Career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. Black and Huber broke up as exclusive doubles partners in April 2010. Since then, Black has partnered with Shahar Pe'er, Elena Vesnina, Yan Zi, Lisa Raymond, Daniela Hantuchov\u00e1, Marina Erakovic, and Anastasia Rodionova. Even though she made the final of Warsaw and won a small tournament in Birmingham, she mostly achieved modest results after the break-up. Partnering with Vesnina and Hantuchov\u00e1 respectively, she lost in the third round of the French Open and Wimbledon. Partnering with Rodionova, she lost in the semifinals of the U.S. Open to eventual champions Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova. Black then missed all tournaments following the US Open and did not qualify for the year end championships for the first time since 1999. Black ended 2010 ranked 13th in doubles, the first time she finished a year outside the top 10 since 2000. However, Black continued her successful partnership with Paes in 2010 as the pair won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon and reached the quarterfinals at the US Open. === 2011 === Entering the 2011 season, Black continued her partnership with Australian Anastasia Rodionova where they reached the semifinal of the 2011 Brisbane International and lost in the first round of 2011 Medibank International Sydney. During the 2011 Australian Open, Black and Rodionova were seeded fifth and reached the quarterfinals where they lost to Huber and Nadia Petrova.

Despite Black being eliminated from both doubles and mixed doubles, Black was a sideline commentator for Seven including the grand final for ladies doubles and was present for former doubles partner Rennae Stubbs's speech. Then, Black did not play until June, where she returned at the Aegon Trophy. She paired-up with Russian Arina Rodionova. She was eliminated in the first round. Her next tournament was the Aegon Nottingham Challenge where she made it to the quarterfinals alongside British Sarah Borwell.

In mixed doubles, she lost in the quarterfinals with Indian Leander Paes against Daniel Nestor and Yung-Jan Chan. === 2012 === Black did not compete on the WTA Tour during 2012, and began playing again in October on two ITF $25,000 events in Australia with Arina Rodionova. The pair won the title in Traralgon, defeating Ashleigh Barty and Sally Peers in the final. However, Black and Rodionova lost to the same team in the finals of Bendigo the following week. She finished the year ranked outside the world's top 600. === 2013: Return to the Top 20 === During the 2013 season, Black had a significant comeback, as she returned to the WTA Tour at the ASB Classic, partnering Anastasia Rodionova in doubles. The pair managed to defeat the top three seeds to win the doubles title, Black's first WTA doubles title with Rodionova, and her first doubles title since 2010. Black and Rodionova lost in the 3rd round of the Australian Open, and won only one match between Indian Wells and Miami, after which the two parted ways. During the clay court season, Black began playing alongside Marina Erakovic, and they made an immediate impact, reaching the finals of the Premier Mandatory tournament in Madrid, as well as in Strasbourg. At the French Open, the pair reached the quarterfinals before losing to second seeds Andrea Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 and Lucie Hradeck\u00e1. Despite reaching the final of the AEGON Classic in Birmingham, Black and Erakovic went out in the 2nd round of Wimbledon. After losing their opening match in Cincinnati, the pair reached the third round of the US Open, losing to Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina of Russia. Black began working with Sania Mirza in September, with whom she ended up winning back to back WTA Premier 5 tournaments in the far east. In Tokyo, Black and Mirza defeated the top seeded team of Hsieh Su-wei and Peng Shuai in the semifinals before taking out Chan Hao-ching and Liezel Huber. It was Black's first Premier 5 title since 2009, and her second of the season. This was immediately followed by a win at the China Open, where en route to the final, they once again took out the top seeds of world number 1 team Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci in the semifinals, before defeating Vera Dushevina and Arantxa Parra Santonja in the final. It was the first time since 2010 that Black had won back-to-back doubles titles, and it took her back up into the world's top 20, finishing the year ranked number 13 in the world. == Grand Slam finals == === Doubles: 9 (5\u20134) === {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |width=\"100\"|Outcome |width=\"50\"|Year |width=\"150\"|Championship |width=\"60\"|Surface |width=\"200\"|Partner |width=\"200\"|Opponents in the final |width=\"150\"|Score in the final |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\" |bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up || 2000 || US Open || Hard || Elena Likhovtseva || Julie Halard-Decugis Ai Sugiyama || 0\u20136, 6\u20131, 1\u20136 |-bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" |bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2004 || Wimbledon || Grass || Rennae Stubbs || Liezel Huber Ai Sugiyama || 6\u20133, 7\u20136(7\u20135) |-bgcolor=\"EBC2AF\" |bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up || 2005 || French Open ||Clay || Liezel Huber || Virginia Ruano Pascual Paola Su\u00e1rez || 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 3\u20136 |-bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" |bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2005 || Wimbledon || Grass || Liezel Huber || Svetlana Kuznetsova Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo || 6\u20132, 6\u20131 |-bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\" |bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2007 || Australian Open ||Hard || Liezel Huber || Chan Yung-jan Chuang Chia-jung || 6\u20134, 6\u20137(4\u20137), 6\u20131 |-bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" |bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2007 || Wimbledon ||Grass || Liezel Huber || Katarina Srebotnik Ai Sugiyama || 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132 |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\" |bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner || 2008 || US Open ||Hard || Liezel Huber || Lisa Raymond Samantha Stosur || 6\u20133, 7\u20136(10\u20138) |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\" |bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up || 2009 || US Open || Hard || Liezel Huber || Serena Williams Venus Williams || 2\u20136, 2\u20136 |-bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\" |bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up || 2010 || Australian Open || Hard || Liezel Huber || Serena Williams Venus Williams || 4\u20136, 3\u20136 |} === Mixed doubles: 8 (5\u20133) === By winning the 2010 Australian Open title, Black completed the mixed doubles Career Grand Slam.
