    "text": "Cladiella australis is a species of soft coral in the family Alcyoniidae. It is found in the western Indo-Pacific. It is commonly known as the finger blanching soft coral because with the polyps extended it appears brown but when poked with a finger, the polyps retract into the leathery base tissue and the coral appears white. ==Secondary metabolites== Five new diterpenes with tricyclic skeletons of cladiellin have been isolated from this soft coral. ==References== Category:Alcyoniidae Category:Animals described in 1936 ",
