() was a semi-professional football club based in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. ==History== The club was founded in 2007 as a semi-professional football club before it was able to gain enough money to successfully register itself as a professional football club in 2008 to play at the bottom of the Chinese football league pyramid. They would rename themselves Hebei Tiangong and would come second in the Northern Group before being knocked out of the play-offs by Hunan Billows 2\u20131 in the first round. At the end of the season, they returned to be a semi-professional football club and did not compete in the league the following season. ==References== ==External links== *Website Category:Defunct football clubs in China Category:Football clubs in China Category:2007 establishments in China Category:Association football clubs established in 2007 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2009 ",
