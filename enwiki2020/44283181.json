Retrieved February 3, 2015. ==Background== The 2014 gubernatorial race was essentially a rematch of the 2010 gubernatorial election. In 2010, Eddie Calvo, a Republican, defeated the Democratic nominee, former Governor Carl Gutierrez (1995\u20132003), with 50.61% of the vote. Calvo took office in January 2011. Governor Eddie Calvo and Lt. Governor Ray Tenorio announced their intention to seek re-election for a second, four-year term. The team held the first official rally to kickoff their campaign on June 7, 2014, at their campaign headquarters in Anigua, following a motorcade of supporters from Yigo. In contrast to the Republicans, the Democratic Party of Guam was initially unable to find a candidate willing to run against Governor Calvo in the 2014 contest. Noting the lack of a nominee, former Governor Carl Gutierrez, who initially declined to enter the election, announced his intention to run for governor on June 26, 2014, just days before the July 1 filing deadline. Gutierrez chose Gary Gumataotao, an attorney, as his running mate. Gutierrez and Gumataotao filed their candidacy papers on June 30, 2014, followed by a campaign rally in Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a. ==Candidates== ===Republican candidate=== *Eddie Calvo, incumbent Governor of Guam (since 2011) ** Running mate: Ray Tenorio, incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Guam (since 2011) ===Democratic candidate=== *Carl Gutierrez, former Governor of Guam (1995\u20132003), 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee. ** Running mate: Gary Gumataotao, attorney ==Endorsements== Former First Lady of Guam Joanne Camacho (2003\u20132011), a Republican and former General Manager of the Guam Visitors Bureau, endorsed Gutierrez for governor in the election.
