    "text": "Good Feeling is the debut studio album from Scottish alternative rock band Travis. The album was originally released on 26 September 1997, on Independiente Records. ==Background and release== In 2000, the album was re- released, with the only differences being new album artwork and a slightly- tweaked version of \"More Than Us\". The album itself has a much more up-beat and 'rockier' sound than their subsequent releases, and is often regarded as one of their best. Once set up in London the band spent between nine months and a year recording new songs. The band played their first London show at the famous Dublin Castle in Camden. With around twenty good songs ready they then approached managers Colin Lester and Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment who then introduced the band to Andy MacDonald, owner of Go! Discs Records and founder of Independiente Records. The band is signed to MacDonald personally, not to the label\u2014if MacDonald ever leaves the Sony-financed label Independiente Records, the band goes with him (commonly referred to in the industry as a \"golden handcuffs\" clause). ==Production== Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, Travis' first studio album, 1997's Good Feeling, is a rockier, more upbeat record than the band's others to date. Recorded at the legendary Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, the place where Travis favourite The Band recorded, the album contained singles such as \"All I Want to Do Is Rock\", \"U16 Girls\", the Beatle'esque \"Tied to the 90's\", \"Happy\" and \"More Than Us\". Guest musicians include Page McConnell of Phish playing keyboards on the title track \"Good Feeling\". The album reached No. 9 on the British charts, but with little radio play, it slipped from the charts relatively quickly. Although it heralded Travis' arrival on the British music scene, received extremely positive reviews, and substantially broadened Travis' fan base, it sold just 40,000 copies. Following the release, Travis toured extensively, their live performances further enhancing their reputation. This included support slots in the UK for Oasis, after Noel Gallagher became an outspoken fan. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Fran Healy. ==Personnel== *Fran Healy \u2013 vocals, guitar *Andy Dunlop \u2013 guitar *Dougie Payne \u2013 bass guitar *Neil Primrose \u2013 drums *Page McConnell \u2013 keyboards ==References== Category:Travis (band) albums Category:1997 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Lillywhite Category:Independiente Records albums ",
