    "text": "Cornelius Gurlitt in 1912 The R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque () is an Ottoman mosque located in the Has\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131 (Strawmat Weavers Market) in the Tahtakale neighborhood of the Fatih district, Istanbul, Turkey. It was designed by the Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan and completed in around 1563. ==History== The R\u00fcstem Pasha Islamic cultural center was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for the grand vizier R\u00fcstem Pasha (the husband of one of the daughters of Suleiman the Magnificent by Hurrem Sultan, Mihrimah Sultan). R\u00fcstem Pasha died at age 61 in July 1561 and the mosque was built after his death from around 1561 until 1563. The mosque complex now hosts a religious school.R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque ==Architecture== ===Exterior=== The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Narrow, twisting interior flights of steps in the corners give access to a spacious courtyard. The mosque has a double porch with five domed bays, from which projects a deep and low roof supported by a row of columns.Freely, Blue Guide Istanbul ===Interior=== The R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque is famous for its large quantities of \u0130znik tiles, set in a very wide variety of floral and geometric designs, which cover not only the fa\u00e7ade of the porch but also the mihrab, minbar and walls. There are around 80 different patterns. These tiles exhibit the early use of Armenian bole, a tomato-red pigment that would become characteristic of \u0130znik pottery. The bright emerald green colour is only used in a panel added above an exterior doorway at a later date. Some of the tiles, particularly those in a large panel under the portico to the left main entrance, are decorated with sage green and dark manganese purple that are characteristic of the earlier 'Damascus ware' coloring scheme. No other mosque makes such a lavish use of Iznik tiles; with later mosques Sinan used files more sparingly. The plan of the building is basically that of an octagon inscribed in a rectangle. The main dome rests on four semi-domes; not on the axes but in the diagonals of the building. The arches of the dome spring from four octagonal pillars\u2014 two on the north, two on the south\u2014 and from piers projecting from the east and west walls. To the north and south are galleries supported by pillars and by small marble columns between them. ==Gallery== File:DSC04137a Istanbul - R\u00fcstem Pasha camii - Foto G.
