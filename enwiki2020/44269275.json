His elder brother, Hans J\u00f8rgen Hammer (1815\u20131882), was also a painter. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1833 to 1839.

After visiting France, Germany and Italy he was back home in 1855. In 1860, he was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal for his painting Korn og frugter under et \u00e6bletr\u00e6 (National Gallery of Denmark).

This resulted in the publication of his book Om de antike lerlamper (Copenhagen: G.C. Ursin. 1887). ==Personal life== In 1853, Hammer was married to Juliette Quintilia Friedenburg (1821-1898). He died at the Copenhagen Municipal Hospital during 1889 and was buried at Assistens Cemetery. ==References== Category:1821 births Category:1889 deaths Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:Danish male painters Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni ",
