    "text": "The Fred J. Hume Award is an annual award presented to the player deemed to be the most \"unsung hero\" for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). It is voted by the fans and presented at the Canucks' the last home game of the regular season. The current holder of the award is forward Antoine Roussel, who won in the 2018\u201319 NHL season. ==History== The Fred J. Hume Award was first presented after the Canucks' inaugural season in 1970\u201371 and was named after former Mayor of Vancouver Fred J. Hume, who was also owner of the Canucks while they were in the Western Hockey League and an active campaigner to bring the NHL to Vancouver. Prior to being decided by a fan vote, the award was decided on by the Vancouver Canucks Booster Club before the organization dissolved in the 2000s. The most any Canucks player has won the award is three times, accomplished by Jannik Hansen (2011, 2013, and 2016). ==List of winners== 2002\u201303 recipient, Matt Cooke, and 2003\u201304 recipient, Brent Sopel 2006\u201307 recipient, Kevin Bieksa 2007\u201308 recipient, Alex Burrows Forward Jannik Hansen is the only three time winner of the award {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Positions key | C || Centre | LW || Left Wing | D || Defence | RW || Right Wing | G || Goaltender |} Player is still active with the Canucks. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Season !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Winner !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" |Position |- | 1970\u201371 | | D |- | 1971\u201372 | | C |- | 1972\u201373 | | D |- | 1973\u201374 | | LW |- | 1974\u201375 | | C |- | 1975\u201376 | | D |- | 1976\u201377 | | RW |- | 1977\u201378 | (2) | RW |- | 1978\u201379 | | D |- | 1979\u201380 | | D |- | 1980\u201381 | | LW |- | 1981\u201382 | | D |- | 1982\u201383 | | D |- | 1983\u201384 | | D |- | 1984\u201385 | | D |- | 1985\u201386 | | RW |- | 1986\u201387 | | D |- | 1987\u201388 | | RW |- | 1988\u201389 | (2) | RW |- | 1989\u201390 | | LW |- | 1990\u201391 | (2) | LW |- | 1991\u201392 | | LW |- | 1992\u201393 | | C |- | 1993\u201394 | | C |- | 1994\u201395 | | LW |- | 1995\u201396 | (2) | LW |- | 1996\u201397 | | C |- | 1997\u201398 | | RW |- | 1998\u201399 | | D |- | 1999\u201300 | | C |- | 2000\u201301 | | D |- | 2001\u201302 | | D |- | 2002\u201303 | | LW |- | 2003\u201304 | | D |- | 2004\u201305 | | \u2014 |- | 2005\u201306 | | RW |- | 2006\u201307 | | D |- | 2007\u201308 | | LW |- | 2008\u201309 | | RW |- | 2009\u201310 | | LW |- | 2010\u201311 | \u2020 | RW |- | 2011\u201312 | | LW |- | 2012\u201313 | (2) \u2020 | LW |- | 2013\u201314 | | G |- | 2014\u201315 | \u2020 | RW |- | 2015\u201316 | (3) | RW |- | 2016\u201317 | | RW |- | 2017\u201318 | (2) | RW |-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | 2018\u201319 | | LW |-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\" | 2019\u201320 | | LW |} ==See also== *Babe Pratt Trophy *Cyclone Taylor Trophy *Cyrus H.
