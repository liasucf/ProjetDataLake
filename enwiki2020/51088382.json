    "text": "Father's Children is an American funk band, that was formed in the late 1960s and rose to fame in the mid-to late 1970s. The group was initially formed as a doo-wop trio in Adams Morgan, Washington, D.C. under the name The Dreams, but evolved into a self contained funk and soul band. In 1973 they were set to release their debut album Who's Gonna Save the World, but their management company folded and the band was unable to find a record label. In 1979 they released their self-titled debut album under the record label Mercury Records. The album was produced by Wayne Henderson formerly of the Crusaders and co- produced by Augie Johnson of the group Side Effect. The group spent 3 months in L.A. recording at Ocean Way Studios, with Wayne Henderson adding a host of other musicians to the recording like Keyboardists Bobby Lyle and Dean Gant. The production added a slicker, L.A. horn driven sound, but took away from the raw East Coast feel, which was a trademark of the band. A lack of effort and money on the part of the label to promote the album, resulted in it not taking off as planned. Father's Children continued to play the role of opening act for all the major acts, locally and throughout the U.S.. The story continues with the changing of personnel through the years, but the two lead vocalist are still keeping the name and sound alive. The group has two recordings, done on their label, Sky's the Limit and Love and Life stories. Who's Gonna Save the World was released by archive music label The Numero Group. The group received attention once again when their song \"Dirt and Grime\" was used by Kanye West as a sample for the track \"Facts\" from his 2016 studio album The Life of Pablo. ==Discography== * Father's Children, Mercury Records, 1979 * Who's Gonna Save the World, The Numero Group, 2011* * Sky's the Limit, FC Music, LLC, 2007* * Love and Life Stories, FC Music, LLC, 2013* ==References== Category:American funk musical groups ",
