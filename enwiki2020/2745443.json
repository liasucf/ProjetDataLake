    "text": "Example of antechamber in a large house or mansion. An antechamber (also known as an anteroom or ante-room) is a smaller room or vestibule serving as an entryway into a larger one. The word is formed of the Latin ante camera, meaning \"room before\". \"Antechamber\" comes from the French antichambre. In some cases, an antechamber provides a space for a host to prepare or conduct private business away from a larger party or congregation. Antechambers are often found in large buildings, homes, or mansions. They are also very common in palaces and crypts. In a theme park, an antechamber may be used to tell guests about a ride before they experience it. ==See also== *The Gate of All Nations *Scarsella ==References== Category:Rooms * * ",
