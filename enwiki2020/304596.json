Barlow is a member of the anglophone minority and of British and Portuguese descent. He studied at the Calcutta University, at the Trinity College of Music in London (Calcutta Centre), at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln (Music University Cologne) and at the Institute of Sonology at Utrecht University. ==Career== Barlow was one of the founders of Initiative Musik und Informatik K\u00f6ln. In 1988 he was the director of music at the International Computer Music Conference in Cologne . From 1990 to 1994, Barlow was the artistic director of the Institute of Sonology, at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, where he also taught in the composition department . Barlow was the Corwin Endowed Chair and Head of Composition at University of California Santa Barbara\u2019s Music Department from 2006 to 2019 . His students have included Missy Mazzoli, Nick Norton, Georg Hajdu, , Marko Ciciliani, Juan Maria Solare, Juan Sebastian Lach, Kristoffer Zegers, Patrick Saint-Denis, and Gabriel Pareyon. ==Compositional style and techniques== Barlow prefers traditional instrumental timbres to electronically synthesized ones because \"they sound so much more alive and exciting\" . Although for this reason most of his works have been written for traditional instruments, he has frequently used the computer to generate the structures of his works. His comprehensive theory of tonality and metrics was first tested in the piano work \u00c7o\u01e7luotob\u00fcsi\u015fletmesi (1975\u201379). Spectral analysis and instrumental resynthesis of human speech has also played an important role in his compositions . ==References== * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Clarence Barlow's Website at UCSB, Department of Music (archive from 17 December 2016, accessed 3 June 2020) *AUTOBUSK \u2013 Barlow's \"Pitch and Rhythm Generator\" software *Clarence BARLOW page at P-ART *Official site *Some MP3s of Barlow's work *Interview with Clarence Barlow by Bob Gilmore (2007) in Paris Transatlantic Magazine *Interview with Musicweb International *archived Culturebase article Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:British classical composers Category:British male classical composers Category:British music educators Category:Utrecht University alumni Category:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty Category:Royal Conservatory of The Hague faculty Category:Pupils of Karlheinz Stockhausen Category:20th-century British composers Category:Musicians from Kolkata Category:20th-century British male musicians Category:21st-century British male musicians ",
