It was planned to be hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers, which would have been the second All-Star Game held at Dodger Stadium, following the 1980 All-Star Game, and the fourth hosted by the Dodgers. On July 3, the game was canceled due to the delayed start of the 2020 season, which began on July 23 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first cancellation since 1945, when the All-Star Game that year was not held in compliance with wartime travel restrictions at the time. As compensation, Dodger Stadium was awarded the All-Star Game in 2022. Fox and ESPN Radio were the game's respective planned television and audio partners. ==Host selection== Bidding for the 2020 All-Star Game began in 2017. It was awarded on April 11, 2018, by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. It would have been the first time since 1980 that Dodger Stadium would serve as the game's host. The Hollywood-inspired logo for the game was unveiled on July 23, 2019, in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium, emceed by longtime Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully. ==Planned league managers and changes== As the manager of the previous season's American League champion Houston Astros, A.J. Hinch was originally designated as the manager for the 2020 American League All-Star team. On January 13, MLB suspended Hinch for the entire 2020 season for his role in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. Astros owner Jim Crane subsequently fired Hinch after the announcement. On January 29, it was announced that Hinch's successor, Dusty Baker, would manage the American League instead. ==Unofficial Starters== Despite the game being cancelled, MLB.com released the players they believed deserved to be recognised as the \"Unofficial 2020 All- Stars\".
