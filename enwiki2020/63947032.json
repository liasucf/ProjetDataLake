    "text": "Cloudkicker is a post-rock / post-metal musical project based in Columbus, Ohio, created by guitarist Ben Sharp. Sharp, a commercial airline pilot, doesn't pursue Cloudkicker as a full-time project; he releases his music as \"pay what you want\" under the Creative Commons license through Bandcamp. Sharp composes, records and engineers all his music by himself; while he originally intended a studio-only project due to his distaste for touring, Sharp performed a short tour in 2014 with Intronaut (who acted as his backing band) and Tesseract. == Discography == === Albums === * 2008: myspace.com/musicistight (Compilation) * 2008: The Discovery * 2010: Beacons * 2011: Let Yourself Be Huge * 2011: Loop * 2012: Fade * 2013: Subsume * 2014: Live with Intronaut (Century Media) * 2015: Woum * 2019: Unending * 2020: Loop (2020) * 2020: Solitude === EPs & Singles === * 2008: The Map Is Not the Territory * 2009: Portmanteau * 2010: A New Heavenly Body * 2010: ] [ (A New Heavenly Body remixed and remastered) * 2013: Hello * 2014: Little Histories ==References== Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Ohio ",
