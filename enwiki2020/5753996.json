    "text": "She is a 1935 American film produced by Merian C. Cooper. Based on H. Rider Haggard's 1887 novel of the same name, the screenplay combines elements from all the books in the series: She: A History of Adventure, She and Allan, Ayesha: The Return of She and Wisdom's Daughter. The film reached a new generation of moviegoers with a 1949 re-release. The ancient civilization of Kor is depicted in an Art Deco style with imaginative special effects. The setting is Arctic Siberia, rather than in Africa, as in the first book. With music by Max Steiner, the film stars Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce. It was hoped that She would follow Cooper's previous success, King Kong. Cooper had originally intended to shoot the film in color, but budget cuts by RKO forced him to shoot the film in black and white at the last minute. However, the black and white film had disappointing results at the box office. It initially lost $180,000, although it later had a successful re- release.Harryhausen, Ray; Vaz, Mark.

Leo Vincey (Randolph Scott) is called from America to the family's ancestral estate in England where his dying uncle John Vincey (Samuel S. Hinds) and Horace Holly (Nigel Bruce) convince him that their ancestor, also named John Vincey (also played by Scott), found the fountain of youth 500 years ago. Following the route outlined in an old journal, Leo and Holly travel through frozen wastes, as a guide named Tugmore and his daughter Tanya (Helen Mack) join them on their quest. They stumble upon the ancient city of Kor, where they are attacked by cannibals but are saved by She Who Must Be Obeyed (Helen Gahagan) and her Minister Billali (Gustav von Seyffertitz). She believes that Leo is the reincarnation of John Vincey \u2014 her lover many years ago \u2014 and vows to make him immortal like herself to rule this Shangri-La in eternal youth. Tanya warns Leo that nothing human can live forever. At the end, She asks Leo to step into the Flame of Life with her, so that they can become immortal. When Leo hesitates, She offers to step in first. Rather than renewing her youth, She ages hundreds of years, becomes a withered mummy-like creature and dies. Leo, Holly, and Tanya then safely make their escape. Gahagan's depiction of the \"ageless ice goddess\" inspired the Evil Queen in Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. ==Cast== *Helen Gahagan as She (Who Must Be Obeyed) *Randolph Scott as John Vincey and Leo Vincey *Nigel Bruce as Professor Horace Holly *Helen Mack as Tanya Dugmore *Gustav von Seyffertitz as Billali, She's mortal Governor ==Production== In July 1932, Universal Studios announced they had bought the rights to the story. In July 1934, RKO announced they would make the film the following year as one of the studio's big productions. Helen Gahagan's and Nigel Bruce's casting was announced in January 1935. It was Gahagan's first movie after a long theatre career. Athlete Jim Thorpe had a small role in the film. ==Reception== Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene reviewed the film positively, but gave a disclaimer that as \"an unrepentant Haggard fan\" he could not write reasonably about it. Describing the film as showcasing \"earnestly manly Boy Scout virtues\", Greene did acknowledge that it \"bore its symbolism a little heavily\", and ultimately characterized it as both thrilling and childish. (reprinted in: ) ==Later releases== She originally had a running time of 102 minutes, but was edited to 94 minutes for its 1949 re-release to better fit on a double bill with Cooper's The Last Days of Pompeii. She was among the films believed lost in a fire at the RKO archives, but an original print was discovered in the garage of the silent film star Buster Keaton and was turned over to film distributor Raymond Rohauer for preservation. In 2006, Legend Films and Ray Harryhausen colorized the film as a tribute to Cooper. The colorized trailer for She premiered at the 2006 Comic-Con. In 2007, Kino Video produced a version that reinstated the eight minutes of scenes deleted in the 1949 release,DVDCompare Retrieved: 7 May 2012 drawing from a slightly lower- quality 16mm print.Monster Kid Classic Horror Forum Retrieved: 7 May 2012Nitrateville classic film forum Retrieved: 7 May 2012 ==Home media== The 1935 fantasy film She, colorized.
