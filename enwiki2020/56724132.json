The game is presented in a first-person perspective, with a primary focus on fast draw and puzzle solving gameplay. Cold Iron was released on January 30, 2018. ==Plot== After mysterious outlaws ride into town and gun down your father, you are tasked with seeking revenge with the help of your father's signature weapon, the titular Cold Iron. Along the journey it is revealed that Cold Iron is a unique weapon with magical properties. The player is subsequently entrusted with destroying the weapon and ridding the world of its evil power while overcoming opponents from different time periods and dimensions who seek to stop you in your quest. ==Gameplay== Cold Iron is marketed under the term \"puzzle-shooter\", combining elements of first-person shooter and puzzle games. After obtaining Cold Iron, players progress through a series of increasingly complex duels. These interactions range from basic western-style duels that emphasize speed, to more puzzle focused battles, such as finding differences between multiple enemies and identifying the correct one. == Reception == According to Metacritic, Cold Iron has received generally favorable reviews. Both GameCritics and PlayStation LifeStyle praised the game's rewarding puzzle elements and split-second shooting. Some reviewers found that the game was overly punishing in its difficulty, though GamingNexus noted that while \"some might consider it too difficult, the game never feels unfair.\" ==References== == External links == * Category:2018 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Windows games Category:PlayStation VR games Category:Single-player video games Category:Indie video games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Puzzle video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:HTC Vive games Category:Oculus Rift games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Unity (game engine) games ",
