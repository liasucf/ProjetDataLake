    "text": "The Blueprint is the sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on September 11, 2001, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West, Just Blaze, and Bink, as well as Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Eminem, who also contributes the album's sole guest feature. At the time of the album's recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop's most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss.Baker, Soren. Review: The Blueprint. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on 2009-09-05. The album is also famous for both its producers Kanye West and Just Blaze's breakouts as major producers. Kanye West produced four of the thirteen tracks on the album, including the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and the controversial \"Takeover,\" which included diss lyrics aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy, while Just Blaze produced three tracks, \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Song Cry\", and \"U Don't Know\", also including the hidden bonus track \"Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)\". The Blueprint received universal acclaim from music critics, with praise being directed at Jay-Z's lyricism and the production. It is considered one of his best albums and has also been labeled as one of the greatest hip- hop albums of all time. Despite its release coinciding with the September 11 attacks, it sold over 427,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number one in the US, holding the spot for three weeks. It was later certified 2x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. In 2019, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". == Background == The Blueprint was reportedly cut in two weeks, with Jay-Z allegedly writing the lyrics in two days. At the time, he was awaiting two criminal trials for gun possession and assault. He was also engaged in feuds with various rappers such as Jadakiss, Fat Joe and in particular Nas and Mobb Deep member Prodigy. In the song \"Takeover\", Jay-Z attacks the two Queensbridge rappers, using a sample of the song \"Five to One\" by The Doors and an interpolation of David Bowie's \"Fame\".Leroy, Dan. Review: The Blueprint. Yahoo! Music. Retrieved on 2009-09-05. On The Blueprint, Jay-Z and his producers used vintage soul as inspiration, including a vocal sample on almost every track from such artists as Al Green, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, David Ruffin and The Jackson 5. Exceptions include \"Jigga That Nigga,\" \"Hola Hovito,\" and \"Renegade,\" a track produced by and featuring the rapper Eminem, and the only track on the album featuring another rapper on verses. == Blueprint Lounge Tour == In late August, Jay-Z announced a September\u2013October tour in small venues. Because of the September 11 attacks occurring on the same day the album was released, the first two performances were rescheduled. Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were subsequently added, and Jay-Z donated a dollar of the cost of every ticket sold from the tour to relief organizations. == Cover == The photograph on the album's cover, taken by Jonathan Mannion, was inspired by one out of The Firm, a series by Jocelyn Bain Hogg depicting organized crime in Britain. Instead of the telephone and brass knuckles seen next to the ashtray in the original picture, a cigar, a pack of cigars and a microphone were placed. == Reception and impact == The Blueprint received rave reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 12 reviews. Upon its release, The Blueprint was hailed by Vibe magazine as Jay-Z's best album as well as the best album of the year, while The Source awarded The Blueprint a perfect 5-mic rating, a distinction reserved for hip hop classics. Nathan Rabin called it Jay-Z's \"strongest, tightest, most consistent album since his legendary debut, 1996's Reasonable Doubt.\" The popularity and commercial success of The Blueprint established Kanye West and Just Blaze as two of hip hop's most celebrated producers. Furthermore, The Blueprint signaled a major stylistic shift in hip hop production towards a more Soulcentric and sample-reliant sound, creating a number of imitators who attempted to emulate the album's atmospheric style. Prior to The Blueprint, mainstream hip-hop producers had largely eschewed music sampling in favor of the keyboard-driven Timbaland sound (characterized by a shifting, syncopated rhythm, similar to samba or jungle music), due to the financial and legal issues associated with copyright laws. The Blueprint, however, revived musical sampling as a common practice in hip hop music and dislodged the digital keyboard-driven production style as the dominant sound in hip-hop music.Exclaim! Canada's Music Authority Kanye West would later incorporate some of the production and sampling techniques he used on this album into his own solo albums. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the- decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"One of the greatest poets ever to pick up a mic released his magnum opus in 2001.

Life and Times of S. Carter, Jay-Z put two hidden bonus tracks at the end of the final track. \"Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)\" is 3:41 by itself. Twenty-five seconds of silence follows after and the bonus track \"Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)\" begins. That song fades and is immediately followed by \"Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2)\". It is reported that the latter song features uncredited vocals by Michael Jackson. The final track as a whole is 12:07. On the iTunes Store, however, these bonus tracks are released as separate tracks, thus making the album 15 tracks long. On the vinyl edition, there are no long gaps between the songs, but they are not printed on the back of the album jacket or record label. == Personnel == * Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter \u2013 performer, executive producer * Eminem \u2013 performer, producer, mixing * Slick Rick \u2013 vocals * Q-Tip \u2013 vocals * Biz Markie \u2013 vocals * Demme Ulloa \u2013 vocals * Schevise Harrell \u2013 vocals * Lauren Leek \u2013 vocals * Keon Bryce \u2013 vocals * Stephanie Miller \u2013 vocals * Michele Mills \u2013 vocals * Josey Scott \u2013 vocals * Victor Flowers \u2013 organ * Kanye West \u2013 producer, vocals * Just Blaze \u2013 producer * Bink \u2013 producer * Timbaland \u2013 producer * Poke & Tone \u2013 producer * DJ Head \u2013 drum programming * Damon Dash \u2013 executive producer * Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke \u2013 executive producer * Gimel \"Young Guru\" Keaton \u2013 engineer, mixing * Jimmy Douglas \u2013 engineer, mixing * Rajon Wright \u2013 assistant engineer * Shane Woodley \u2013 assistant engineer * Jason Goldstein \u2013 mixing * Richard Huredia \u2013 mixing * Supa Engineer \"Duro\" \u2013 mixing * Doug Wilson \u2013 mixing * Tony Vanias \u2013 recording director * Tony Dawsey \u2013 mastering * Jason Noto \u2013 art direction * Jonathan Mannion \u2013 photography * Della Valle \u2013 images * Dana \"Sonni Black\" Anderson \u2013 composer * Sonet Lumiere Philadelphia \u2013 music publisher == Charts == === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
