    "text": "G\u00e9d\u00e9on Ouimet (June 2, 1823 - April 23, 1905) was a French-Canadian politician. Born in what is today part of the city of Laval, Quebec Canada, Ouimet served as the second Premier of the province of Quebec from February 26, 1873 to September 22, 1874. He resigned as party leader of the Conservative Party of Quebec in 1874 because of the Tanneries scandal which implicated the government of Quebec. He was appointed to the Legislative Council of Quebec in 1895. He died in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec in 1905. The Quebec town of Grandmont changed its name to Saint-G\u00e9d\u00e9on in honour of Ouimet. A bridge on Highway 15 (Laurentian) was also named after him; the bridge crosses the Rivi\u00e8re des Mille \u00celes. It connects the municipality of Laval to the northern shore in what is now known as the town of Boisbriand. ==See also== *Politics of Quebec *List of Quebec general elections *Timeline of Quebec history *List of presidents of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal ==External links== * * *History of the Quebec town of Saint-G\u00e9d\u00e9on Category:1823 births Category:French Quebecers Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada Category:People from Laval, Quebec Category:Presidents of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal Category:Premiers of Quebec Category:Conservative Party of Quebec MNAs Category:Conservative Party of Quebec MLCs Category:Quebec political party leaders Category:1905 deaths Category:Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery burials ",
