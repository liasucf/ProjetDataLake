    "text": "Mari-Jo P. Ruiz is a Filipina mathematician, currently a professor emeritus of mathematics at Ateneo de Manila University. Ruiz specializes in graph theory and operations research. ==Education and career== Ruiz grew up in Manila, and was educated at College of the Holy Spirit Manila. She graduated from Marymount Manhattan College in New York City in 1963, and soon afterward completed a master's degree at New York University. She joined the Ateneo de Manila faculty in 1965, eight years before the school began accepting women as students. She chose academia over a competing job offer from industry because at the time it paid slightly better. She acquired the nickname \"Mustang Mary\" at this time, because of the Ford Mustang that she drove. Ruiz completed her PhD at Ateneo in 1981. At Ateneo, she has served as chair of mathematics, chair of management engineering, dean of arts and sciences, and trustee. She retired to become a professor emeritus in 2009. ==Book== With Jin Akiyama, she is the author of the book A Day\u2019s Adventure in Math Wonderland (World Scientific, 2008; translated into 7 other languages). ==Recognition== The College of the Holy Spirit Alumnae Foundation gave Ruiz their Distinguished Alumna in Education Award in 2001. In 2014, Ateneo gave Ruiz their Lux-in- Domino Award. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Filipino mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians Category:Marymount Manhattan College alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:Ateneo de Manila University faculty ",
