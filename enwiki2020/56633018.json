    "text": "John Robert Hipp is an American criminologist and professor in the department of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine). He is also the co-director, with Charis Kubrin, of the Irvine Lab for the Study of Space and Crime (ILSSC), as well as the director of UC Irvine's Metropolitan Futures Initiative. He has conducted multiple studies of unemployment and crime rates in and around Irvine, California, finding remarkably low rates of both there. His research has also shown that crime in Los Angeles tends to be intraracial, despite the fact that several exceptions received considerable media attention, and that immigration has not led to an increase in crime rates in Southern California. ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page * Category:Living people Category:American criminologists Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:University of California, Santa Cruz alumni Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
