    "text": "The Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English: Fidelity Cross) is a medal of the Spanish Armed Forces, primarily awarded to military chaplains. It is awarded by the military archbishopric to reward faithful service by chaplains, as well as services to the archbishopric by deserving civilians, institutions and other military personnel. ==History== The Cruz Fid\u00e9litas was created by decree of then military archbishop Francisco P\u00e9rez Gonz\u00e1lez on July 25, 2007. The decree established the award as a decoration of the Archdiocese of Spain, rather than the military, and stipulated that only the current military archbishop had the authority to award grades of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas. However, he may temporarily delegate the power to award any class of the award to any chaplain he sees fit, other than that of Grand Cross. The names of those who receive the medal are published in the Official Bulletin of the Military Archbishopric of Spain. ==Classes== There are three classes of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas that can be awarded to military chaplains. These are the Cruz de la Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English: Cross of the Fidelity Cross), awarded for 15 years of service, the Encomienda de la Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English: Commendation of the Fidelity Cross), awarded for 20 years of service, and the Plata de la Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English:Plate of the Fidelity Cross), awarded for 25 years of service. * 100px Plate of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (First Class) * 100px Commendation of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (Second Class) * 100px Cross of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (Third Class) Two classes of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas also exist, which can only be awarded to non-chaplains. These are the Cruz de Honor de la Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English: Cross of Honor of the Fidelity Cross), awarded for constant or highly effective service to the archbishopric, and the Gran Cruz de la Cruz Fid\u00e9litas (English: Grand Cross of the Fidelity Cross), awarded for exceptional and valuable service. * 100px Grand Cross of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas * 100px Cross of Honor of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas ==Insignia== The ribbon of the medal is purple, with two white stripes extending down each side. From the ribbon hands a white-enameled cross bordered in gold, with gold spikes extending between the arms. In the center of the cross is the emblem of the Military Archbishopric of Spain, enameled in red. The reverse of the medal features a capital letter \"F\" relieved in the center of the cross, and the year \"2007\" on the lower arm, also in relief. A gold crown is used to suspend the cross from the ribbon. Aside from that of the Cross of Honor, the ribbon bars of each grade also bear a device, dependent on the grade received. The ribbon bars of the Plate, Commendation, and Cross of the Cruz Fid\u00e9litas bear a Latin cross fleury, in gold, silver or bronze, respectively. The ribbon bar of the Grand Cross features a Spanish Royal Crown. ==Notable recipients== === Cross of Honor === * Antonio Padillo * Don Alonso Ros Carrasco * Juan Salvador ==See also== * Orders, decorations, and medals of Spain * Military Archbishopric of Spain ==References== Category:Orders, decorations, and medals of Spain Category:Military awards and decorations of Spain Category:Awards established in 2007 ",
