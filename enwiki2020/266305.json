The name of the month is Babylonian. It is an autumn month of 30 days. Tishrei usually occurs in September\u2013October on the Gregorian calendar. In the Hebrew Bible, before the Babylonian Exile, the month is called Ethanim ( \u2013 ). In the Babylonian calendar the month is known as Ara\u1e2b Ti\u0161ritum, \"Month of Beginning\" (of the second half-year). Edwin R. Thiele has concluded, in The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, that the ancient Kingdom of Judah counted years using the civil year starting in Tishrei, while the Kingdom of Israel counted years using the ecclesiastical new year starting in Nisan. Tishrei is the month used for the counting of the epoch year \u2013 i.e., the count of the year is incremented on 1 Tishrei. ==Holidays in Tishrei== Rosh Hashanah greeting card, 1910 1-2 Tishrei \u2013 Rosh Hashanah 3 Tishrei \u2013 Tzom Gedaliah \u2013 (Fast Day) \u2013 On Tishrei 4 when Tishrei 3 is Shabbat 9 Tishrei \u2013 Erev Yom Kippur 10 Tishrei \u2013 Yom Kippur \u2013 (Fast Day) 15\u201321 Tishrei \u2013 Sukkot/Sukkos :21 Tishrei \u2013 Hoshanah Rabbah 22 Tishrei (and 23 outside of Israel) \u2013 Shemini Atzeret/Atzeres & Simchat Torah/Simchas Torah ==Tishrei in Jewish history and tradition== *1 Tishrei (circa. 3760 BCE) \u2013 Adam & Eve were created, according to one opinion in the Talmud. *1 Tishrei (1923 CE) \u2013 Daf Yomi study regimen is launched. *2 Tishrei (1659 CE) \u2013 HaRav Tuvya and HaRav Yisroel were murdered in a blood libel in Razino. *3 Tishrei (circa 582 BCE) \u2013 Assassination of Gedaliah; now a fast day.
