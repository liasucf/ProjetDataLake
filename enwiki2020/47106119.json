    "text": "The Tuckerman Water Tower is a historic waterworks facility at the south end of Front Street in Tuckerman, Arkansas. It is a tall metal structure, with four latticed legs, braced with rods and sloping inward, to support a water tank that is bowl-shaped at the bottom and topped by a conical roof. A pipe traverses the center of the tower for the movement of water to and from the tank. Built in 1935 with funding support from the Depression-era Public Works Administration (PWA), it is the only remaining PWA tower of its type in the county. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Arkansas Category:Infrastructure completed in 1935 Category:Towers completed in 1935 Category:Water towers on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Public Works Administration in Arkansas Category:Water towers in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Jackson County, Arkansas ",
