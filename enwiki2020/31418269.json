Mickey Wright, age 23, won the first of her four LPGA Championships, six strokes ahead of runner-up Fay Crocker. It was the first of Wright's thirteen major titles. Defending champion Louise Suggs finished ten strokes back, in a tie for ninth. The field consisted of 27 professionals; a concurrent event for amateurs was also held. The LPGA Championship was played for a second straight year at Churchill Valley, which hosted its third major the following year, the U.S. Women's Open in 1959. The club closed in 2013. ==Past champions in the field== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Louise Suggs||align=left||| 1957 || 76 || 74 || 72 || 76 || 298 || +18 || T9 |- | align=left|Beverly Hanson || align=left| || 1955 || 72 || 74 || 72 || 83 || 301 || +21 || T14 |- | align=left|Marlene Hagge || align=left| || 1956 || 76 || 78 || 77 || 76 || 307 || +27 || T17 |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Sunday, June 8, 1958 {|class=\"wikitable\" !
