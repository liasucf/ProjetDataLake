He was the first American League umpire to work home plate in the World Series wearing an inside chest protector, doing so during Game 3 of the 1977 World Series. Through 1974, all AL umpires were required to use the outside chest protector, while the NL had adopted the inside chest protector for decades under the leadership of Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem. Starting in 1977, new AL umpires had to use the inside protector; umpires already on staff were grandfathered and could continue to use the outside protector. McCoy began using the inside protector in 1977. == See also == * List of Major League Baseball umpires ==References== ==External links== * BaseballLibrary.com * Retrosheet Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball umpires Category:People from Stoddard County, Missouri ",
