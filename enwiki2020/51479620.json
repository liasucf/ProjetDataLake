    "text": "Maria Osipovna (Iosifovna) Knebel (; 1 June 1985)For dates before the Soviet state's switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar in February 1918, this article gives the date in the New Style (Gregorian) date-format first, followed by the same day in the Old Style (Julian) date-format (which appears in square brackets and slightly smaller); this is to facilitate comparison between primary and secondary sources. The difference between the two is 12 days for Julian dates prior to 1 March 1900 [Gregorian 14 March] and 13 days for Julian dates on or after 1 March 1900. Thus, Knebel was born on the 31 May according to the Gregorian calendar that is in use today, while her birthday was 19 May according to the Julian calendar that was in use at the time. For more information on the difference between the two systems, see the article Old Style and New Style dates. Dates after 1 February 1918 are presented as normal. was a Russian theatre practitioner and acting theorist.Carnicke (2010, 99, 101) and Golub (1998, 603). Having trained with Konstantin Stanislavski, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, and Michael Chekhov, her work integrated the approaches and emphases of all three, with a particular focus on Stanislavski's technique of \"active analysis\" in the rehearsal of plays.Carnicke (2010, 99). She worked as a character actor, a theatre director, and a teacher.Carnicke (2010, 99, 102) and Golub (1998, 603). Her students included the actor Oleg Yefremov, the playwright Victor Rozov, and the directors Anatoly Vasiliev and Adolf Shapiro.Carnicke (2010, 99\u2014100). In 1958, she was named a People's Artist of the RSFSR.Golub (1998, 603). Her roles as an actor included Charlotta in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, the madwoman in Alexander Ostrovsky's The Storm, and Sniffles in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Blue Bird at the Moscow Art Theatre.Carnicke (2010, 100, 102).
