    "text": "GrassMaster is a hybrid grass sports playing field surface composed of natural grass combined with artificial fibres. It was developed and patented by Desso Sports in 1993. This hybrid grass system is now developed by Tarkett Sports after a takeover of Desso Sports and has been rebranded since as GrassMaster. Tarkett Sports developed PlayMaster in 2016, a new lay-n-play hybrid grass solution. == Technology == GrassMaster reinforces a natural grass pitch by vertically inserting 20 million polypropylene (PP) fibres into the soil. The long PP fibres are injected by computer-controlled machines, deep so remains above the surface, in a grid about . The grass roots entwine with the fibres and grow deeper and wider. The PP fibres above the surface are designed to ensure an even and stable surface. GrassMaster may be installed before seeding, after seeding or on grass sods. == Major installations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Stadium ! Club ! Sport !
