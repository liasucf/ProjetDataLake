Originally the story centered around how we have created social classes amongst ourselves and gave away humanity but as Nsamba shot the film he lost his friend Obobo who was murdered which led him into depression hence the change in plot. The film was shot with a production budget of about $15 in a period of 3 weeks shooting 2 days a week. It was done based on teamwork at the project where every member of The Ghetto Film Project offered their expertise free of charge. The production value of the film is $2500. After the premier, the film was released on YouTube on 20 June 2015 and Vimeo on 21 June 2015 ==References== Category:2015 short films Category:Ugandan films ",
