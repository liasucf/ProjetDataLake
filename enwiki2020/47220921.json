The inaugural NFL was won by Laois, captained by Dick Miller. They defeated Sligo in the semi-final after a lost game was ordered replayed, and beat Dublin in a low-scoring final despite losing two players, Paddy Lenihan and Bill Keeley, to emigration shortly before the final. == Format == The league was organised on a provincial basis with a separate league for each province: three leagues for Leinster due to the large number of counties. The six league winners played a knockout tournament to decide the National Football League. It is mentioned that the three Leinster Group winners played off (Longford scratching, Laois beating Dublin) for a gold medal, but this does not seem to have formed part of the league proper.Laois GAA History, 1920-29 ===Knockout stage qualifiers=== * Leinster: 3 teams * Munster: 1 team * Connacht: 1 team\"National League\", Irish Independent, 07/05/1926, p. 10 * Ulster: 1 team ==Group stage== ===Connacht (Connacht Railway Cup)=== ====Results==== ===Leinster I=== ====Results==== ====Table==== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !Pts !Status |- align=center style=\"background:#bbccff;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||3 ||0 ||0 || 6 ||rowspan=1|Advance to Knockout stage |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 ||rowspan=3| |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||3 ||1 ||0 ||2 || 2 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||0 ||0 ||3 || 0 |} ===Leinster II=== ====Results==== ====Table==== {| style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !Pts !Status |- align=center style=\"background:#bbccff;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||3 ||0 ||0 || 6 ||rowspan=1|Advance to Knockout stage |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 ||rowspan=3| |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||3 ||1 ||0 ||2 || 0 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||0 ||0 ||3 || 0 |} Westmeath forfeited the points from their win v Offaly due to being late on the field\u201cLeague Figures\u201d Irish Independent, Friday 20 November 1925 ===Leinster III=== ====Results==== ====Table==== {| style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !Pts !Status |- align=center style=\"background:#bbccff;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||3 ||0 ||0 || 6 ||rowspan=1|Advance to Knockout stage |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 ||rowspan=3| |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||2 ||0 ||0 ||2 || 0 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||2 ||0 ||0 ||2 || 0 |} ===Munster (Munster Football League)=== Won by . ===Ulster (Dr McKenna Cup)=== ====North-West Group==== =====Regulation games===== =====Play- Offs===== ====North-East Group==== =====Regulation games===== =====Play- Offs===== ====Final==== ====Final standings==== =====North-West Group===== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !Pts !Status |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 ||rowspan=4| |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||0 ||1 || 4 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||3 ||0 ||0 ||3 || 0 |} =====North-East Group===== {| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 |- align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !Pts !Status |- align=center style=\"background:#bbccff;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||1 ||0 || 5 ||rowspan=1|Advance to Knockout stage |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||3 ||2 ||1 ||0 || 5 ||rowspan=3| |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text- align:left;\"|border ||2 ||0 ||0 ||2 || 0 |- align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"|border ||2 ||0 ||0 ||2 || 0 |} ==Knockout stage== ===Quarter-Finals=== \\---- ===Semi-Finals=== \\---- An objection was successfully made and a replay ordered. \\---- ===Final=== ===Leinster League Inter-group Ties=== *The game was initially awarded to Longford as Dublin failed to finish owing to a disputed decision.
