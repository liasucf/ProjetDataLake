    "text": "The Penguin Award is an annual award given for excellence in broadcasting by the Television Society of Australia. It was founded in 1954. The award trophy depicts an ear listening to a television tube, but strongly resembles a penguin, hence the name. The award was designed by Des White, an artist and designer at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ==Past winners== ===1970=== *SPECIAL AWARD: Outstanding Achievement in Television, 1969 Moon Telecasts - Dept of Supply, Australian Government (coordinating agency in Australia for NASA) ===November 1972=== *LEADING QUIZMASTER - Tony Barber, The Great Temptation, Channel 7. *LEADING DRAMA TALENT - TIE - James Laurenson, Boney and Michael Pate, Matlock Police, Network 10. *LEADING NATIONAL NEWSREADER - Brian Naylor. *COMMONWEALTH FILM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION $3000 TV DRAMA PRIZE - Division 4: Episode 'The Return of John Kelso'. *SPECIAL COMMENDATION - Over There.
