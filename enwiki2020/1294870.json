    "text": "The zebra oto or tiger oto (Otocinclus cocama) is a fish of the genus Otocinclus of the family Loricariidae that originates from Peru. ==Taxonomy== The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the R\u00edo Ucayali in Peru. Its closest relatives appear to be O. huaorani, O. bororo, O. mariae, and O. mura, as well as the more recently described species O. batmani. ==Distribution and habitat== This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. They associate with marginal vegetation. ==Appearance and anatomy== The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other Otocinclus species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies. The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of Otocinclus. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for O. batmani. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4 cm (1.7 in) in SL, though the males are smaller. ==In the aquarium== The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000. They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers. ==See also== *List of freshwater aquarium fish species == References == * Category:Hypoptopomatini Category:Freshwater fish of Peru Category:Fish described in 2004 ",
