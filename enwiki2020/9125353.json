In 2007, it had approximately 46,000 members, in 1,000 local groups. ==History== IOGT-NTO was formed in 1970, through the merger of the Swedish chapter of IOGT with Nationaltemplarorden (NTO), a Christian Swedish temperance organization. IOGT was established in Sweden in 1879, when the first local chapter was started in Klippan, and was then called Godtemplarorden. In 1888, a group of people left Godtemplarorden to form another temperance order, Nationalgodtemplarorden. The latter group was merged with the Templarorden, a Swedish branch of the American organisation Templars of Temperance, in 1922, to form the NTO. ==Activities== IOGT-NTO works to promote total abstinence from alcohol among its members and in society. The organisation also offers a variety of study circles in various subjects, which are open to non-members. It operates two Folk high schools, and a treatment facility for alcohol abusers. ==Youth organisations== The youth organisation affiliated with IOGT- NTO is Ungdomens Nykterhetsf\u00f6rbund, which as of 2007 had 125 local clubs. IOGT-NTO also runs an organisation for children, called Junis. Nykterhetsr\u00f6relsens Scoutf\u00f6rbund (The Temperance Movement's Scouting Association) is a scouting organisation which is also part of IOGT-NTO. ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Alcohol in Sweden Category:Temperance organizations ",
