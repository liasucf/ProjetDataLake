The Royal Navy purchased her in July 1805 as an advice boat and commissioned her under Lieutenant John Wells. It renamed her HMS Dove later that year, and then in 1806 renamed her HMS Flight. In September 1806 Flight disappeared in the English Channel, and was presumed to have foundered with the loss of all hands. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:1803 ships Category:Ships built in England Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Cutters of the Royal Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 1806 Category:Missing ships Category:Ships lost with all hands Category:Shipwrecks in the English Channel ",
