    "text": "The Merchant of Venice is a 2004 romantic drama film based on Shakespeare's play of the same name. It is the first full-length sound film in English of Shakespeare's playother versions are videotaped productions which were made for television, including John Sichel's 1973 version and Jack Gold's 1980 BBC production. The title character is the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons), not the Jewish moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino) who is the more prominent character. This adaptation follows the text, but omits much. Director Michael Radford believed that Shylock was Shakespeare's first great tragic hero who reaches a catastrophe due to his own flaws. The film begins with text and a montage of how the Jewish community is abused by the Christian population of Venice and brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish ghetto in Venice. A co-production between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Luxembourg, The Merchant of Venice was screened non-competitively at the 61st edition of the Venice Film Festival on 4 September 2004 in what was touted as its world premiere (the film in fact was screened 3 September 2004 at the Telluride Film Festival). ==Plot== The movie begins with Antonio talking to two men, Solario and Salerio. Antonio tells them he is sad, and that there is no specific reason why. We meet Bassanio, Gratiano and Lorenzo, and we find out Bassanio needs money to court a beautiful woman named Portia. Antonio agrees to help Bassanio and gets a loan from a Jewish money lender named Shylock. Shylock agrees to the bond, with the condition that if he is not repaid, he gets a pound of flesh. ==Cast== * Al Pacino as Shylock * Jeremy Irons as Antonio * Joseph Fiennes as Bassanio * Lynn Collins as Portia * Zuleikha Robinson as Jessica * Kris Marshall as Gratiano * Charlie Cox as Lorenzo * Heather Goldenhersh as Nerissa * Mackenzie Crook as Launcelot Gobbo * John Sessions as Salerio * Gregor Fisher as Solanio * Ron Cook as Old Gobbo * Allan Corduner as Tubal * Anton Rodgers as The Duke * David Harewood as Prince of Morocco * Jules Werner as Franciscan Friar ==Reception== The Merchant of Venice received generally positive reviews; it has a \"fresh\" rating of 72% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 124 critic reviews, with the consensus, \"A respectable if uneven take on the Bard's The Merchant of Venice.\" On Metacritic the film has an average score of 63/100. Most critics praised both the interpretation of the Shylock character by Michael Radford and Al Pacino and the dark, realistic look of the streets of Venice, for which production designer Bruno Rubeo was honoured by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists. Reception to the film's treatment of antisemitism was mixed, with some critics praising Radford's contextualizing choices but feeling that they were nonetheless unable to fully prevent Shylock from being an antisemitic caricature, and others feeling that Shylock's villainy was sanitized in order to make him into an overly sympathetic victim of prejudice. The film was noted for its emphasis on the love triangle aspect of Bassanio's relationships with Antonio and Portia, including a kiss between Bassanio and Antonio. In 2005, the film had a Royal Premiere in the presence of Prince Charles and received a BAFTA nomination for Best Costume Design. Its worldwide theatrical gross was about $21.3 million, with a production budget of $30 million. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Interview with director Michael Radford, and actors Al Pacino & Jeremy Irons on Charlie Rose Category:2004 films Category:2004 romantic drama films Category:British films Category:British romantic drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Radford Category:Films based on The Merchant of Venice Category:Italian films based on plays Category:British films based on plays Category:Films scored by Jocelyn Pook Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films shot in Luxembourg Category:Films about Jews and Judaism Category:Films set in 1596 Category:Films set in Venice Category:Sony Pictures Classics films Category:Antisemitism in fiction Category:2004 drama films ",
