The singles released for the album were as follows: \"When I'm Gone\", \"The Road I'm On\", \"Here Without You\", and \"Away from the Sun\". The recording sessions took place during the summer of 2002 with producer and engineer Rick Parashar at London Bridge Studio, in Seattle, Washington. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson performed live with the band during their premiere party in Biloxi for Away from the Sun. The album has sold eight million copies worldwide, including well over four million in the US alone. ==DualDisc version== This album was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The test market DualDisc version of the album is rare. In 2005 the DualDisc version was reissued in a more widely distributed version. The original test market version differs from this common version in both packaging elements and in the design of the back of the inlay card. The DualDisc has the standard CD album on one side, and a DVD-Audio/DVD-Video on the second side. The DVD-Audio portion contains the entire album in advanced resolution 5.1 PCM surround sound and 2.0 PCM stereo. The PCM audio was recorded at 96 kHz and 24bit for both audio tracks, but the 5.1 audio track is at 13,824kbit/s and the 2.0 audio track is at 4,608kbit/s. Special features for the DVD-Audio include the band's biography, a photo gallery and lyrics for the listed tracks only (not for the hidden track \"This Time\").
