Originally known as Kewhira, Kohima was founded in 1878 when the British Empire established its headquarters of the then Naga Hills. It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963. Kohima was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. The battle is often referred to as the \u2018Stalingrad of the East\u2019.Dougherty 2008, p. 159.Ritter 2017, p. 123 In 2013, the British National Army Museum voted the Battle of Kohima to be \u2018Britain's Greatest Battle\u2019.

Kohima lies on the foothills of Japf\u00fc range located south of the District () and has an average elevation of 1,261 metres (4137 feet). ==Etymology== Kohima was originally known as Kewhi\u2013ra. The name, Kohima, was officially given by the British as they could not pronounce the Angami name of (Tenyidie for \"the land where the flower \u2018Kewhi\u2019 grows\"). It is called after the wild flowering plant \u2018Kewhi\u2019, found in the mountains. Most local people prefer to use \u2018Kewhi\u2013ra\u2019. ==History== Kohima was originally a large village named Kewhira, which is located in the northeastern part of the present day Kohima urban area. The village is divided into four Thinuos: Ts\u00fctuonuomia, Lhisemia, Dapf\u00fctsumia and Pfuchatsumia (T, L, D, and P Khel respectively). ===Colonial era=== The British incursions into the Naga territory, beginning in the 1840s, met with stiff resistance from the independence-loving Nagas, who had never been conquered by any empire before. The stiffness of the resistance can be gauged by the fact that it took nearly four decades for the British to conquer a territory that is less than 10,000 square kilometres (the eastern region was left free). Kohima was the first seat of modern administration as the Headquarters of Naga Hills District (then under Assam) with the appointment of Guybon Henry Damant as Political Officer in 1879. ===Battle of Kohima=== The mined tennis court and terraces of the District Commissioner's bungalow in Kohima. In 1944 during World War II the Battle of Kohima along with the simultaneous Battle of Imphal was the turning point in the Burma Campaign. For the first time in South-East Asia the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies which the Allies then retained until the end of the war. This hand-to- hand battle and slaughter prevented the Japanese from gaining a high base from which they might next roll across the extensive flatlands of India.Bert Sim, Mosstodloch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland: Pipe Major of the Gordon Highlanders at Kohima: his home is named \"Kohima.\" -- RJWilliams, Slingerlands, NY/USA Kohima War Cemetery, Kohima, Nagaland Kohima has a large cemetery known as the War Cemetery in Kohima for the Allied war dead maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
