He moved from Prague, to Kladno, Plze\u0148, Bucharest, Prachatice and Nepomuk, and finally to T\u00e1bor, where he established the photographic firm \u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek, which survived for three generations. ==Biography== Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl was born in Prague, on 26 May 1840, into the family of a miller. His father intended him to become a trader, and his first job was administrator for the business of Alexander Klier, in Prague. In 1863 he moved to Kladno, to learn the art of photography, and in 1865 he was granted tradesman\u2019s rights. Only a few of his cartes de visite remain from that time, and these are now stored in the family archive. In 1864, he moved to Plze\u0148, and opened his studio, the fourth in the town. Contemporary newspapers mention his photographing of the unveiling of the memorial to sculptor Wiltd, and describe it as being successful in spite of the inclement weather on the day. This is the first mention of Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl\u2019s outdoor work. In 1868, he went into partnership with photographer Franz Bergman. The two men later had a falling out, after which \u0160echtl and his wife Antonia left Plze\u0148 and he became an itinerant photographer. He tried his luck in Bucharest in 1871, and in Nepomuk and Prachatice. Several significant photographs remain from this period. One unique work that has survived is a photomontage, achieved by double exposure, depicting Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl both as laboratory worker and retouching a photo, in one picture. Also interesting are photos of towns, for example, shots of Prachatice, Jistebnice, T\u00e1bor, \u017dirovnice and a panoramic photograph of Blatn\u00e1. In 1870, Ign\u00e1c's daughter Antonia was born. Four years later, his wife Antonia died. Later, on trips to T\u00e1bor, he met Catherine \u0160tastn\u00e1, housekeeper of Josef N\u011bmec, the husband of famous writer, Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1. Catherine later became his second wife. At 36, \u0160echtl finally settled in T\u00e1bor, and officially opened his studio in 1876, at house number 333 on Maria Square. His son, Josef Jind\u0159ich, was born in 1877. Family tradition says that the same day, in a pub, \u0160echtl met the commercial traveller Jan Vose\u010dek, who very soon became a partner in the firm. The 1880 census reveals Vose\u010dek as \u0160echtl\u2019s assistant. Ign\u00e1c documented with passion the evolution of the town of T\u00e1bor, even though he lost money on this work. From the years 1876-77, several photos remain of T\u00e1bor Square shortly after the renovation of the Town Hall, and a photo-essay documenting the unveiling of the Jan \u017di\u017eka Memorial by sculptor Josef V\u00e1clav Myslbek. In 1878, the weekly newspaper \u010cesk\u00fd Jih announced the founding of the partnership of Alexander Seik and Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl. Some of the photos from this time bear the logo of both photographers, while others show individual logos. However, Seik was losing interest in photography and was turning his attention to politics, so around 1886 the partnership came to an end. However, the separation of the two studios does not appear to have damaged \u0160echtl\u2019s business. Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl was a founding member of the Fishermen\u2019s Club, and he was also a popular amateur actor. It is said that the audience laughed as soon as Ign\u00e1c appeared on stage. His experience as an actor, his wit, and his sense of theatre, are apparent in many of his photos. Jan Vose\u010dek started his work with \u0160echtl in the former Seik studio in 1888. We have photos signed by Vose\u010dek from this time. He became a partner in the firm \u201cSch\u00e4chtl and Vose\u010dek\u201d, later changed to the Czech spelling of \u201c\u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek\u201d. In 1896, Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl discovered a new passion \u2013 cinematography. He held the first licence in Bohemia for showing moving pictures. What would have been the first showing in Bohemia was scheduled for Plze\u0148, in 1896. However, due to technical difficulties at Plze\u0148, it appears the first-ever showing was in fact, by Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl, in the Shooting Gallery in T\u00e1bor, in 1897. However, Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl was dissatisfied with the technical quality, and he travelled to Vienna to try to solve these problems. He became an itinerant cinematographer, but the business kept losing money, and finally, he sold it to the magician, Viktor Ponrepo. In 1902, the firm \u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek exhibited at the great Regional Exhibition in T\u00e1bor. Ign\u00e1c, with his son Josef Jind\u0159ich, created a large photo-essay of the Exhibition, which survives to this day. He also documented the building of the Bechyn\u011b Railway in 1903, and many Sokol meets. In 1904, his son Josef became a full partner in the firm. In 1906, the firm opened a branch in Pelh\u0159imov, and also exhibited at the Austrian Exhibition in London. In 1907 they started building a new studio, in the place of the former Seik studio, which became the largest in Southern Bohemia. Ign\u00e1c \u0160echtl died on 6 July 1911. The firm \u0160echtl and Vose\u010dek survived, until nationalisation by the Communist government in 1953. ==References== * V.
