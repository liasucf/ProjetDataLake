By 1920 the team had their first international player, when Steve Morris won a cap for Wales.

In 1926 Cross Keys RFC found themselves in dire financial trouble, and requested help from the Welsh Rugby Union. The WRU refused an appeal for a cash loan, but instead agreed to send the Welsh national team to play in an exhibition match at Pandy Park. The sell-out crowd assured Cross Keys future and resulted in an historic win for the home team thirteen points to eight.The Rugby Clubs of Wales pp149, David Parry-Jones (1989) Rugby observers have noted the high level of talent in the Cross Keys pack, and criticised the fact they went under represented in the national team during the 1920sSmith (1980), pg 259. and 1930s.Smith (1980), pg 282.
