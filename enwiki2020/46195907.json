Retrieved March 17, 2015. ==Early life and education== George Edward Dorris was born into a prominent family in Eugene, Oregon, the son of Benjamin Fultz Dorris and Klysta (Cornet) Dorris.\"Dorris, George,\" in Who's Who in America (New Providence, N.J.: Marquis Who's Who, 2015). In 1892, his great-uncle George Dorris had purchased a farm in Springfield, about five miles for Eugene, and had experimented with various crops before establishing a hazelnut orchard in 1905. The mild weather, abundance of rain, and well-drained soil of the Willamette Valley provided ideal conditions for growing nut trees. Over the next fifty years the Dorris Ranch, as the farm was known, was enlarged, as Ben Dorris joined his uncle and developed the property to some seventy-five acres with a nursery and thousands of trees.Sofia McDonald Bennett, \"Harvesting Hazelnuts at Dorris Ranch,\" The Local Dish, http://thelocaldish.com/harvesting-hazelnuts-dorris-ranch. Retrieved March 16, 2015. Young George Dorris was not, however, interested in a career in the nut industry, being more attracted to languages and literature than to agriculture. Accordingly, after graduation from high school in 1948, he studied Spanish and English literature at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Upon receiving his bachelor of arts degree a year early, he spent a year working in San Francisco, where he had opportunities to attend concerts, plays, and performances of opera and ballet. Thereafter, he enrolled in the graduate school of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, to pursue his studies in Restoration and eighteenth-century English literature. In his second year he was awarded a university fellowship that paid his tuition and living expenses, and in 1955 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for study in Italy. After some months there, he returned to Northwestern as a graduate assistant in the Department of English. While finishing his doctoral dissertation on poet, librettist, and translator Paolo Antonio Rolli (1687-1765) and the Italian circle in London, he took his first teaching jobs and was finally awarded a doctoral degree in 1962. ==Academic career== Before completing his dissertation, Dorris began his professional career as an instructor of English literature at Duke University in North Carolina (1957-1960). He then moved on to Rutgers University in New Jersey (1960-1962), the University of the Pacific and its constituent Raymond College in California (1962-1964), and to Queen's College of the City University of New York (1964-1967). The remainder of his teaching career (1967-1998) was spent at York College, also a component of the City University of New York. There he rose from assistant professor to associate professor of English literature, teaching courses in Restoration and eighteenth-century drama, poetry, and prose as well as occasional courses in criticism and dance history. In February 1965, after attending a performance of New York City Ballet, Dorris had the good fortune to meet the poet Jack Anderson, who was then working at Dance Magazine. Dorris had long been interested in dance, having seen programs presented by American Ballet Theater, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the Royal Ballet of London, and the Martha Graham Dance Company. His interest in dance history increased upon meeting Anderson, who, along with their friend George Jackson, was also writing for the English magazine Ballet Today. In his academic field, Dorris had found that there was \"not much new to say about John Dryden or Alexander Pope,\" but he came to realize that \"there were enormous areas of dance just waiting to be discovered.\"George Dorris, script for From the Horse's Mouth: Magical Tales of Real Dancers, a program conceived and directed by Tina Croll and Jamie Cunningham, premiered at the Theater of the 14th Street Y, New York City, January 2013, and later presented at Pace University and at Buddies in Bad Times in Toronto, Canada,.

Then, at a party in 1966, he met Arlene Croce, who had recently founded a magazine called Ballet Review, and he joined the ranks of its early contributors, thus beginning a long, distinguished career as a dance historian. He was encouraged in his endeavors by Selma Jeanne Cohen, a leading light in dance scholarship, who became a lifelong mentor and friend. Beginning in 1967, Dorris served for ten years as music editor for Ballet Review, and, eventually, as its regular reviewer of musical recordings (1993\u2013present). In 1975, he joined the board of directors of Dance Perspectives Foundation as secretary, serving in that capacity until 1981. In 1977, Dorris and Anderson were the founding editors of Dance Chronicle: Studies in Dance and Related Arts, a journal published by Marcel Dekker that became the acknowledged leader in the field of dance scholarship. They continued to produce several issues a year\u2014four at first, then three\u2014until 2007, when they relinquished their roles to younger scholars.See Dance Chronicle, Taylor and Francis Online, http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journals. During these years, Dorris was also active in several professional organizations focused on dance history and criticism. In 1978, he was a founding member of the Society of Dance History Scholars, for which he served on the board of directors (1979-1983, 1990-1993) and on the editorial board (2001-2004). He also served on the board of directors of the Dance Critics Association (1980-1983, 1996-1999) and the World Dance Alliance (1991-2012) and was a longtime member of the Congress on Research in Dance. He had a significant effect on the policies and direction of all these organizations, helping each one to move forward toward its stated goals. In 1981, Selma Jeanne Cohen invited Dorris to become an associate editor of the International Encyclopedia of Dance, a major undertaking of the Dance Perspectives Foundation. As the area editor for dance from 1400 to 1800 and for Western music, he worked on the project for many years, until its successful publication in 1998.After failing during development at two academic publishing houses, Charles Scribner's Sons and the University of California Press, this encyclopedia was published by Oxford University Press (USA) in New York City. Soon after, he was invited to become one of a group of principal researchers for Popular Balanchine, a project of the George Balanchine Foundation devoted to documenting Mr. Balanchine's work on Broadway shows and Hollywood films, He completed his research on the operettas Rosalinda (1942) and The Merry Widow (1943) in 2002.George Balanchine Foundation, Popular Balanchine, http://balanchine.org/balanchine/03/pc. Retrieved March 17, 2015. Soon after, in 2005, he collaborated with Frank Andersen, artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet, and Danish dance critic Erik Aschengreen in organizing a symposium held at the international festival in Copenhagen celebrating the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of choreographer August Bournonville.John Rockwell, \"Keeping a Danish Legacy on Its Toes,\" New York Times, June 5, 2005. ==Selected writings== * Paolo Rolli and the Italian Circle in London, 1713-1744.
