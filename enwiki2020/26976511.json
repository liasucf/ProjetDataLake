    "text": "Malm\u00f6 FF won its first league title since 1988, thanks to smart spending of the 9 million \u20ac transfer money of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 three years earlier. Afonso Alves was the bearing player in the team, having signed from \u00d6rgryte IS for an estimated 1.2 million \u20ac. The title was won in front of 27 343 ecstatic supporters at Malm\u00f6 Stadion. Malm\u00f6 beat IF Elfsborg 1-0 thanks to Jon Inge H\u00f8iland scoring on a rebound, following Niklas Skoog's miss. Following a 2-1 victory at IFK G\u00f6teborg in front of almost 40 000 spectators earlier that week, IFK gave Malm\u00f6 a helping hand by drawing against Halmstads BK 1-1 away from home, which proved crucial in securing Malm\u00f6's title. The club competed in Allsvenskan, Svenska Cupen and The UEFA Intertoto Cup for the 2004 season. ==Players== ===Squad stats=== |} ==Club== ===Kit=== | | ===Other information=== ==Competitions== ===Allsvenskan=== ====League table==== ==== Results summary ==== ==== Matches ==== ===Svenska Cupen=== Kickoff times are in UTC+2. ==References== * Category:Malm\u00f6 FF seasons Malmo FF Category:Swedish football championship-winning seasons ",
