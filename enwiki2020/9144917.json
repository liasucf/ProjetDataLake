    "text": "The Wattenbach or Wattenerbach is a river of Tyrol, Austria, a tributary of the Inn. The Wattenbach has its origin in the Tux Prealps. The rivers M\u00f6lsbach and Lizumbach merge in the valley bottom near at a height of thus forming the origin of the Wattenbach. It then flows from the Wattentaler Lizum almost due north though the Wattental valley. After it empties near Wattens into the Inn. ==Water quality== Until the river reaches Wattens the water has grade A quality. The small village Wattenberg diverts their wastewater into the sewage works of Fritzens. The water of the Wattenbach is used by the companies Swarovski and . Although the water is cleaned through several sewage treatment plants the Inn suffers from the polluted water. Only the heavy metal pollution could be reduced strongly. Several constructed defence structures have also successfully been avoiding high water. ==Usage== Nine power plants use the water furthermore intensively and the water also is used by industry facilities. Therefore, sometimes very little water runs and the brook is threatened by desiccation. ==References== Category:Rivers of Tyrol (state) Category:Rivers of Austria ",
