It was originally the Cambridge home of Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Moving to Cambridge in 1956, they converted four small cottages into one idiosyncratic house and a place to display Ede's collection of early 20th-century art. Ede maintained an 'open house' each afternoon, giving any visitors, particularly students, a personal tour of his collection. In 1966, Ede gave the house and collection to the University of Cambridge, but continued living there before he and his wife moved to Edinburgh in 1973. The house is preserved as the Edes left it, making a very informal space to enjoy the permanent collection and live music. In 1970, the house was extended, adding an exhibition gallery in a contrasting modernist style by Leslie Martin. The house and gallery temporarily closed in June 2015 during a major building project to create a four-floor education wing, improved exhibition galleries, a new entrance area and a caf\u00e9. A series of gentle additions by Jamie Fobert Architects offers greatly improved support services for visitors, including a new courtyard and welcome area and a new shop. The project cost \u00a311,000,000 including \u00a32,320,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and \u00a33,700,000 from Arts Council England. The interior of the house has been left untouched. During the closure, there were displays of the collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings. Kettle's Yard is part of the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. == Permanent collection == An exhibition of Diet Sayler in the gallery in 2000 Christopher Wood Self- portrait (1927) The permanent collection is composed of paintings, sculptures and objects collected by Ede. It is largely based on associations and friendships formed when Ede was a curator at Tate Gallery, and as such it is biased towards works from the British avant-garde of the first half of the 20th century. Ian Hamilton Finlay described Ede's \"fusion of art and found objects\" on an inscribed pebble as \"the Louvre of the pebble\".Exhibition catalogue 'Beauty and Revolution: The Poetry and Art of Ian Hamilton Finlay' Kettles Yard, Cambridge 2014 Notable artists represented in the collection are: *Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i *William Congdon *Helen Frankenthaler *Henri Gaudier-Brzeska *Ian Hamilton Finlay *Barbara Hepworth *David Jones *Joan Mir\u00f3 *Henry Moore *Ben Nicholson *Winifred Nicholson *Alfred Wallis *Christopher Wood ==See also== * Primavera Gallery on King's Parade, has put on several exhibitions at Kettle's Yard * Wysing Arts Centre, a research and development centre for the arts, west of Cambridge in Bourn ==References== ==External links== *Kettle's Yard Gallery website *Kettle's Yard House *Kettle's Yard Collection *Video conversation between Roger Wilson and Paul Coldwell to accompany the exhibition 'Paul Coldwell: I called while you were out' 2008/9 * Category:Art museums established in 1966 Category:Art museums and galleries in Cambridgeshire Category:Museums in Cambridge Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge Category:Non-School institutions of the University of Cambridge Category:Country houses in Cambridgeshire Category:1966 establishments in England ",
