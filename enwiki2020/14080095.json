    "text": "Monimus of Syracuse Monimus (; ; 4th century BC) of Syracuse, was a Cynic philosopher who endorsed philosophical skepticism, denying that there was a criterion of truth.Sextus Empiricus, Against the Logicians, 7.88. ==Biography== According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Monimus was the slave of a Corinthian money-changer who heard tales about Diogenes of Sinope from Xeniades, Diogenes' master. In order that he might become the pupil of Diogenes, Monimus feigned madness by throwing money around until his master discarded him. Monimus also became acquainted with Crates of Thebes.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, vi. 82 He was famous for saying that \"everything is vanity\"Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, vi. 83; compare Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, ii. 15. (\u03c4\u1fe6\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, tuphos, literally 'mist' or 'smoke'). According to Sextus Empiricus, Monimus was like Anaxarchus because they \"compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.\"Sextus Empiricus, Against the Logicians, 7.88. He said that \"it was better to lack sight than education, because under the first affliction, you fall to the ground, under the latter, deep underground,\"Stobaeus, Florilegium, ii. 13. 88 and he also said that \"Wealth is the vomiting of Fortune.\"Stobaeus, Florilegium, iv. 31. 89 He wrote two books: On Impulses, and an Exhortation to Philosophy, and he also wrote some jests mixed with serious themesDiogenes La\u00ebrtius, vi. 83 (presumably related to Cynic-style spoudogeloia). In book two of Meditations, Marcus Aurelius writes: Alternate translation by George Long: \"Section II-15. Remember that all is but opinion. For what the Cynic Monimus said is obvious: and obvious too is the use of what he said, if a man accepts what may be got out of it only as far as it is true.\" ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:4th-century BC Greek people Category:4th- century BC philosophers Category:Classical Greek philosophers Category:Ancient Syracusans Category:Cynic philosophers Category:Pyrrhonism ",
