    "text": "Battle of the Brains was a Philippine quiz show shown at RPN 9 from 1992 to 1999 and at PTV 4 from 2000 to 2001. It was hosted for almost all episodes by David Celdran, with various alternates (including Chiqui Roa-Puno, Cathy Santillan, and Anthony Suntay) taking over in his absence. The show is primarily sponsored by Uniwide Sales, Inc. (a major budget retailer during the show's popularity) from 1992 to 1999, and by AMA Computer College from 2000 and 2001 before the show folded. The show was open to all elementary, high school and college students nationwide, but the majority of grand champions have come from Metro Manila. ==Tournament format== *Competitors usually join by contacting Focal Media Arts by telephone, and are directly slotted for the televised Weekly Finals. However, there are also reports that non-televised provincial rounds have been held.https://nursingero.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/kalat/ *Each season determines its elementary, high school, and college level Grand Champions in a single-elimination tournament with 4 rounds (called the Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Grand Finals). Only the top competitor advances to the next round. *The Weekly and Quarterly Finals feature 4 competitors each, while the Monthly and Grand Finals each field 3 competitors. However, there have been exceptions to this allocation for rounds prior to the Grand Finals. *Each competing elementary and high school is represented by 2 students (except for elementary teams from Seasons 1 and 2, which fielded 3 students each). The college competition featured an individual representing the school, except from Season 8 (1999\u20132000 season) onwards, when 2-person teams were adopted. *Alternates were allowed for elementary and high school competitors. But once used in competition, the alternate must continue to compete, taking the displaced student's place, for the rest of the competition. *In Season 9 (2000\u20132001 season), the format for the college level was changed to the returning-champion format similar to that of Jeopardy!. The winner will return on the next episode to face a new set of challengers until they lost. ==Episode format== *A panel of judges is present at every round, whose members are usually professors from top Philippine universities. Their primary function is to oversee and settle any disputes or complaints. Some of the competition's judges have been: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name of Judge !! Affiliation !!

Each round involved an equal number of questions asked in 5 subject areas: Science, Mathematics, History, General Information, and Arts/Literature. *The host reads the question twice, and is given some freedom to paraphrase the question. Contestants may answer as soon as the question is first read. *Contestants answered by buzzing in first, which when performed is accompanied by a unique light and sound display. The rostra are rigged with a lockout buzzing system: contestants buzzing in late will not generate the light and sound display. After buzzing, the host acknowledged the school and were given 5 seconds to answer correctly. If not, they forfeit the question and the other teams are given the chance to answer, subject to the same time constraints. For each question given, a team may only attempt to answer once. All contestants are given a chance to answer. *If no contestant attempts to buzz within 5 seconds (or within 30 seconds for math questions) after a question has been asked, the host announces the correct answer. *Points allotted for each question have varied, but generally the harder-category questions carry more points. *At the end of each round, the host recaps the scores and announces round leaders or winners. *In case of a tie for the winner, sudden-death questions were asked. The first team to answer correctly became the winner. *The winner of each round prior to the Grand Finals had the opportunity to answer 10 bonus questions within 1 minute and earn PHP 600 for each correct answer. From seasons 7 onwards the bonus round involved a 3-ring pattern board. Difference in mechanics for elimination rounds prior to Grand Finals, years 1-2 (1993\u201394): *3 students per team in the elementary round, reduced to 2 students in season 3 but with total prizes unchanged. *Same 30 questions in total, but grouped into easy, average and difficult rounds of 10 questions each. *Only two contestants out of four are given the chance to answer. To prevent two contestants blocking the chances of the remaining two contestants, a score penalty is imposed in the difficult round for the second & subsequent wrong answers made. This penalty is waived after season 2 as all contestants get a chance to answer. Mechanics for the Grand Finals and the ASEAN Invitational Finals are modified as follows:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2L4y9byqoAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ycSitDHzxE *Written-answer format with correct spelling required, and with no buzzers involved so all contestants can simultaneously score on each question. *No more bonus round after the winner is announced. *Still 30 questions in total, grouped in the same manner as in the eliminations, equally weighted in the 5 subject areas mentioned above, and with sudden-death questions employed in case of a tie for the winner. *The competition also has a list of reference books which are used in settling disputes which are given to Grand Finalists. Since year 7 the books themselves are sometimes part of the Grand Prize. In the 3-ring pattern board, the contestant chooses 1 of 3 concentric rings to accomplish, with the questions in each ring having a common theme (such as all answers beginning with the same letter, or of people from a particular field). Rings with more questions are found at the outermost portion of the set, and are generally easier to answer per question, while rings with fewer questions are at the center of the set are usually harder per question. Each question adds points to the total, while completing a ring merits extra prizes from show sponsors. *Complaints against questions, which may lead to score changes, are allowed during the actual taping of the show and are resolved with the decision of a panel of judges. But the actual protestations are not shown on air: the host simply summarizes the complaint and explains the score change. ==Eligibility rules== *Any school recognized by the Philippine Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) was eligible to compete. It must field students who are enrolled at the school at the designated level at the time the season starts. It is unknown whether Philippine schools abroad which are recognized by DECS were technically eligible. *For the elementary and high school levels, 1 alternate may be designated who will participate for the duration of the tournament once he or she is activated. *For the elementary and high school levels, a school may be represented only once during the entire tournament. At the college level, a school may be represented as often as possible, provided it has not yet reached the Grand Finals. Once a competitor from a school makes the Grand Finals, other contestants from the same school will not be allowed to compete. *As is common in televised academic quiz formats in the Philippines, which promote the 'give-chance-to- others' concept, an individual can become Grand Champion only once per level. This means that, for example, winning the elementary Grand Championship twice is not allowed, but winning 1 elementary and 1 high school Grand Championship is. ==Venues== All rounds prior to the Grand Finals were recorded in Broadcast City, Quezon City. However, the Grand Finals were usually held at different auditoriums, including the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Season Number !! Dates Covered !!

From Seasons 1 to 6, Grand Champions were awarded the following (in units of Philippine pesos, before 20% tax on prizes): {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Level !! Student/s !! School !! Coach !! Total |- | Elementary || 300,000 || 100,000 || 100,000 || 500,000 |- | High School || 400,000 || 100,000 || 100,000 || 600,000 |- | College || 500,000 || 0\u2020 || 0\u2020 || 500,000 |- |} \u2020 - No coaches are formally recognized or awarded. Schools are recognized but are not given a separate prize. However, in reality, certain college competitors are given support or formal recognition by coaches and university officials. In Seasons 7 and 8, most likely due to Uniwide Sales' financial troubles, the Grand Finals prize was paid \u20b1100,000 in cash and the balance in kind which included household appliances, encyclopedia sets and other books, and travel packages to destinations within the Philippines. The travel destination for the students may be different from that of the coaches. From Seasons 1 through 7, all Grand Finalists were awarded plaques prior to taping, with the eventual Grand Champion getting another trophy at the conclusion of the Grand Finals. In Season 8, certificates were given for each round win prior to the Grand Finals, and a Grand Champion trophy was given at the conclusion of the Grand Finals. ==Special Editions/Portions== *Prior to the start of the elementary, high school, and college tournaments, the show may sometimes air Celebrity Edition episodes, where competitors are each composed of a television personality (usually female) and a college-level contestant (usually male). It may be observed during parts of the Celebrity Edition that the college contestant presses the buzzer and whispers the answer to the celebrity, who in turns provides the response to the host. The Celebrity Edition is not part of any tournament format. *In 1997, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of ASEAN, an ASEAN Invitational Battle of the Brains was aired on RPN 9, pitting the Season 5 Grand Champions against students from Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&dat;=19970712&id;=x5gVAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=9woEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2248,1616478https://web.archive.org/web/20010424151024/http://www.uni- wide.com/bob/asean.html#contestdate The Philippine champions won at all levels. *From 1995 to 1997, a Mind Master portion was added to the program, in which college graduates (some of whom have previously competed as students) compete as individuals in a 2-competitor, returning-champion format. The winner gets to compete in the next episode until losing. Leonardo Gapol (Season 1 College Grand Finalist) was well known for winning 18 consecutive matches. ==Grand Champions and Finalists== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left |- !

In fact, the name of the show has been synonymous to any quiz competition in the Philippines, regardless of content and degree of TV coverage. Theresa Reyes Alvarez holds the copyright of \"Battle of the Brains\" with registration no. M 97-353. Its level of fame during its time can be compared to those of the Kilometrico Quiz Date and Student Canteen's IQ7 in the 1960s-1970s, and the Digital LG Quiz in 1999-2004. It has also served as the model for various quiz competitions, televised or not, in the Philippines. David Celdran's name has become strongly associated with the show. Winners at the show, especially in later stages and as Grand Champions, are known to have gotten celebrity attention within their school campuses. The comedy show Tropang Trumpo parodied the show in a segment called Battle of the Brainless.http://rojan88.wordpress.com/tag/battle-of-the- brains/ In each episode, the competitors are said to come from schools whose names sound very similar to those of actual Philippine schools. Each question given by host is usually met by incorrect and humorous responses from competitors. The episode mostly ends in a tie for all schools. The host (usually portrayed by Ogie Alcasid) is also known to wear shorts, which is revealed as he moves away from his rostrum. ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Award !! Category !!
