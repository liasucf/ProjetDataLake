    "text": "Ry\u014dgoku Station and the surrounding area, with the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo stadium in the foreground Katsu Kaish\u016b, who was born in Ry\u014dgoku ' is a district in Sumida, Tokyo. It is surrounded by various districts in Sumida, Ch\u016b\u014d, and Tait\u014d wards: Yokoami, Midori, Chitose, Higashi Nihonbashi, and Yanagibashi. In 1659, the Ry\u014dgoku Bridge was built, spanning the Sumida River just upstream of its confluence with the Kanda River. Its name, meaning \"two provinces,\" came from its joining Edo (the forerunner of Tokyo in Musashi Province) and Shim\u014dsa Province. The district derived its name from that of the bridge. The Forty-seven r\u014dnin avenged the death of their lord, Asano Naganori, by breaking into the mansion of his enemy, Kira Yoshinaka, in 1703. Part of the mansion has been preserved in a public park in Ry\u014dgoku. Ry\u014dgoku Station in the neighboring Yokoami district was opened in 1904, bringing rail transportation to the area. It is regarded as the heartland of professional sumo. Most training stables or heya are based there. The first Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan stadium for sumo was completed in 1909. The present one was built in 1985 in the Yokoami district north of Ry\u014dgoku. Three of professional sumo's six annual official tournaments take place there. ==Notable people from Ry\u014dgoku== Famous people connected with Ry\u014dgoku include Katsu Kaish\u016b, who was born there in 1823. Novelist Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa was raised in the district. Television personality and former member of the House of Councillors Kyosen \u014chashi was born there. Ry\u014dgoku is home to the Edo-Tokyo Museum. == Sumo == Because the Ry\u014dgoku bridge was developed in the region, during the Edo period this part of Tokyo became as significant as Ueno and Asakusa. Sumo wrestling began to grow very popular due to the Kanjin sumo, which were championships organized to raise money for the construction of temples. These tournaments were held at the Eko-in temple. Most of the biggest Sumo tournaments are held in January, May and September at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena. ==References== Category:Districts of Sumida, Tokyo ",
