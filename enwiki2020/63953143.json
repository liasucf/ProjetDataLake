    "text": "Magnolia \u00d7 brooklynensis is a hybrid Magnolia that is the result of a cross between Magnolia acuminata {cucumbertree) and Magnolia liliiflora (Mulan magnolia). It was developed in a breeding program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden beginning in 1953 to create yellow-flowered varieties. A number of cultivars of Magnolia \u00d7brooklynensis are commercially available, including 'Evamaria', 'Hattie Carthan', and 'Yellow Bird' (the result of a back-cross with 'Evamaria' and M. acuminata var. subcordata). 'Evamaria' has purplish flowers with touches of orange, yellow or green. 'Hattie Carthan' has yellow flowers with a blush of red-purple veins, and 'Yellow Bird' has deep yellow petals. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden also created the 'Elizabeth' cultivar, which is often lumped in with M. \u00d7 brooklynensis, by crossing Magnolia acuminata and Magnolia denudata. The cream to pale yellow flowered Magnolia 'Elizabeth' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==References== brooklynensis Category:Interspecific plant hybrids Category:Ornamental plant cultivars Category:Ornamental trees Category:Plants described in 1972 ",
