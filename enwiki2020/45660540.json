    "text": "Party funding in Israel is political financing in Israel that covers the funds raised and spent to influence political competition between political parties, especially the campaigns for national (Knesset) and municipal elections as well as the routine operation of party organizations. Ever since the Yishuv. the pre-state formation of Jewish life in Eretz Israel, political parties have been the foremost organizations of the polity.Arian, Asher: The Second Republic. Politics in Israel, Chatham NJ: Chatham House, 1998, pp. 4-5, 14-14, 24-25. == Spending on politics == Although it is widely believed that Israel is \"the most expensive democracy per voter in the world\" Arian, Asher: The Second Republic. Politics in Israel, Chatham NJ: Chatham House, 1998, p. 155. authors rarely provide summaries of the overall expenses for party competition. In 1960 Alexander Heard mentioned more than US-$5.00 per voter.Heard, Alexander: The Costs of Democracy, Chapel Hill NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1960, pp. 373-375. Arnold Heidenheiomer (1963) allocated an index value of 20.50 Heidenheimer, Arnold: 'Comparative Party Finance - Notes on Practices and Towards a Theory', in: Journal of Politics, vol. 25, no. 4, 1963, pp. 798-799. (both the highest values in their sample). In 1984 Howard Penniman reported US-$4.34 per citizen (much lower than Venezuela's US-$20.35).Penniman, Howard R.: 'U.S. Elections: Really a Bargain', in: Public Opinion, vol. 7, no., 1984, pp. 52-53. Based on data for the 1990s a German study ranked Israel together with Austria, Italy and Japan among the top spenders on party politics.'Ist unsere Demokratie zu teuer?' In: Einblicke. Nr. 39, 2004, S. 24; see PDF (Accessed 13 March 2015). For the period between 1973 and 1992, Mendilow assumes a relative decline of ongoing expenses as compared to the escalation of campaign spending.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and the Schemes of Mice and Men', in: Party Politics, vol. 2, no. 3, 1996, p. 332. Between 1973 and 1984, current operations of parties amounted to US-$2.8 and US-$7.0 million.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 143. If the legal spending limit was equal to actual campaign spending, US-$26 million per year were needed for current operations in 1989.Kalchheim, Chaim/ Rosevitch, Shimon: 'The Financing of Elections and Parties', in: Elazar, Daniel J./ Sandler, Shmuel (eds.): Who's the Boss in Israel. Israel at the Polls, 1988-89, Detroit: Wayne State University, 1992, p. 227. Both in election and non-elections years, parties incur different kinds of expenditure. During non-election periods, most party funds are spent on salaries for paid party workers and expenses for permanent offices. Over time, the outlay for public meetings in Israel has declined, whereas the importance of advertising and media has grown considerably. However, on election day, Israeli parties continue to spend on taxis to bring voters to the polls and to pay for party workers' food and time. \"Such expenses can amount to between 25 and 33 per cent of campaign expenses.\"Peretz, Don/ Doron, Gideon: The Government and Politics of Israel, Boulder CO: Westview Press, 3rd ed., 1997, p. 128; see also Gutman, Emanuel: 'Israel', in: Journal of Politics, vol. 25, no. 4, 1963, p. 713-714. == Sources of revenue == Party membership used to be a major source of funding when a high percentage of the adult population were members of a political party. However, just like in other democracies) party membership has decreased. In 1969 still 18 per cent of the citizens retained a membership, in 1990 there were roughly just 7 per cent left.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 146-147; Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and the Schemes of Mice and Men', in: Party Politics, vol. 2, no. 3, 1996, p. 332. The share of party income from membership was less than 10 per cent of the total then.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and Party Transformation in Multi-Party Systems', in: Comparative Political Studies, vol. 25, no. 1, 1992, p. 101. \"Individual contributions to general elections are permitted as long as they originate from donors who are Israeli citizens and residents above the age of eighteen,\" provided the donation does not exceed NIS 50,000 and it is not anonymous.Levush, Ruth: Campaign Finance: Israel, Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, p. 3; available at: . A report in Haaretz contends that somehow non-residents made political contributions in 2015.'Who are the biggest contributors to politics in Israel? Many live in New York and Miami', in: Haaretz, 6 February 2015. In 1969, Israel had started to provide public funding for party activity. This source of revenue has increased its importance ever since. Between 1975 and 1984, public subsidies had covered about 85 per cent of declared annual routine expenses.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 143. == Regulation of money in politics == Public law stipulates a variety of rules for the flow of money in politics. Israeli laws restrict both donations and expenses. Most of the rules concern political parties. However, as candidates run their own campaigns in party primaries, these under surveillance for 30 days, too. For candidates in primaries donations by foreign individuals are permitted.For details see Levush, Ruth: Campaign Finance: Israel, Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, available at: . Applicable are the Political Parties (Financing) Law, 5733-1973, and the Parties Law, 5752-1992.The text of these laws is available in: Party Financing and Elections Financing in Israel, Background Material Prepared at the Request of the Secretary General of the Knesset, July 21, 2003, pp. 11-28 PDF file . ==See also== * Campaign finance * Party subsidies * Political party funding * Politics of Israel ==Sources== ===References=== ===Bibliography=== * Gutman, Emanuel: 'Israel', in: Journal of Politics, vol. 25, no. 4, 1963, pp. 703\u2013717. * Doron, Gideon: 'Party Financing', in: Arian, Asher/ Shamir, Michal (eds.), The Election in Israel, 1984, New Brunswick and Oxford: Transaction Books, 1986, pp. 37\u201353. * Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel.
