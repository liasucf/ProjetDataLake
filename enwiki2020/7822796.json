    "text": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) is the body responsible for match officials in English professional football. Formerly known as the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOB), it was formed when English referees became professional in 2001, to provide officials for all games played in the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and Football Association (FA) competitions. The organisation is funded by the Premier League, EFL, and the FA. The Select Group Referees primarily officiate in the Premier League, EFL Cup, and FA Cup and will also occasionally referee in the EFL.http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/referees/about- pgmol.html ==Staff== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- ! Name ! Job Title |- | Neale Barry | FA Head of Refereeing |- | Mike Riley | PGMOL Managing Director |- | Adam Watts | Select Group Director |- | Alan Wiley | Select Group 2 Director |- | Mike Jones | National Group Director |- | Richard Beeby | International Referee Development Manager |- | Simon Breivik | Head of Fitness & Medicine |- | Paul Russell | Head of Psychology |} ==Evaluation== The Select Group Referees meet twice per month for training sessions and analysis of match videos and data. The PGMOL have their own sports scientists, sports psychologists, physiotherapists, sprint coaches, podiatrists and vision scientists which mirror football clubs to help improve referee performance. Every PGMOL referee is evaluated by a former senior referee to measure their technical performance, along with fellow players and managers (match delegates) who assess accuracy and consistency of their decision making and management of their game. ==Sponsorship== The PGMOL changed its sponsorship for the 2010\u201311 season from Air Asia to its parent group, Tune Group. For the 2012\u201313 season Expedia sponsored the officials, but this agreement ended after a year. For the start of the 2013\u201314 Premier League season PGMOL had no sponsor, but part way through the season EA Sports signed a long term agreement which saw their logo on the arms of all officials in the Premier League and EFL until 2019.http://www.premierleague.com/en- gb/news/news/2013-14/jan/pgmol-ea-sports-sign-long-term-partnership/ ==Controversy== In September 2016, Mark Halsey, a former member, claimed that PGMOL asked him to lie in match reports. PGMOL denied the claim, and no further action was taken. In 2020, HMRC challenged the employment status of PGMOL appointed referees. The tax authority's case centred on the claim that referees should be treated as employees. However, the courts sided with PGMOL in handing down a decision that their referees are indeed self-employed. ==References== ==External links== Category:Football refereeing in England Category:English football organisations Category:Premier League Category:English Football League Category:FA Cup Category:Sports organizations established in 2001 ",
