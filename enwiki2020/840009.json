    "text": "Louise Jane Wener (born 30 July 1966, Gants Hill, London, England)Different for Girls, L. Wener; Ebury Press 2010, page 6 is an English writer, songwriter, singer and guitarist of the band Sleeper. She is the younger daughter of Donald Wener, an Inland Revenue tax inspector from East Ham who had served in the RAF, and Audrey (n\u00e9e Dixon), a bank clerk and former nurse. She attended Manchester University where she met Jon Stewart, eventually leading to the formation of Sleeper. Her elder sister was the writer Sue Margolis. Their brother, Geoff, managed Sleeper after attending Cambridge University. Sleeper recorded four full-length albums: Smart, The It Girl, Pleased to Meet You, and The Modern Age. After the band split up in 1998, Wener began a writing career, and has written four novels: Goodnight Steve McQueen, The Big Blind (also known as The Perfect Play), The Half Life of Stars, and Worldwide Adventures In Love. Her autobiography, Different for Girls: My True-life Adventures in Pop (also known as Just For One Day: Adventures in Britpop), was published in June 2010. Wener co-wrote a BBC Radio 4 drama series, Queens of Noise, with Roy Boulter of The Farm. It ran for two five-programme series in the 10.45am Woman's Hour drama slot, focusing on the rise of a fictional indie band, Velveteens. In addition to writing herself, Wener has taught novel-writing. With her partner, Sleeper drummer Andy MacLure, she formed another band, Huge Advance, although they only played in and around their residential suburb of Crouch End. By 2011, she and MacLure had married and moved to Brighton, where MacLure teaches at a music college. They have a son and a daughter. Wener has written an article about motherhood for The Guardian. Sleeper reformed in 2017 to play in four British cities in July and August as part of the Star Shaped Festival. They went on to headline an eleven-date tour in 2018. The band have since recorded a new album, released in March 2019, entitled The Modern Age. ==Bibliography== *Goodnight Steve McQueen. Flame. 1 August 2002. . *Different for Girls.
