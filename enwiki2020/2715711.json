    "text": "Jumada al-Awwal (), also known as Jumada al-Ula (), or Jumada \u2160, is the fifth month of the 12 lunar months in the Islamic calendar. The month spans 29 or 30 days. The origin of the name is theorized by some as from the word jam\u0101d () meaning \"arid, dry, or rainless\" - denoting the dry and parched land, hence the dry months. The secondary name Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u016al\u0101 may possibly mean \"to take charge with, commend, entrust, commit or care during the arid month\". However, this is rejected by some as it is a lunar month, which does not coincide with seasons as solars months do. In Ottoman Turkish, used in the Ottoman Empire, the name was J\u00e8m\u0101z\u00ecyyu-'l-\u00e8vvel, or G\u0303\u00e9mazi l\u00e8l\u00e8vv\u00e8l. In Turkish it was abbreviated J\u0101, or G\u0303a. In Turkish today the spelling is Cemaziyelevvel. ==Timing== The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Jumada al-Awwal migrates backwards throughout the seasons, during a cycle of about 33 solar years. The estimated start and end dates for Jumada al-Awwal are as follows (based on the Umm Al-Qura calendar of Saudi ArabiaUmm Al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia): {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" |+Jumada al-Awwal dates between 2018 and 2022 |- !scope=\"col\"|AH !scope=\"col\"|First day (CE/AD) !scope=\"col\"|Last day (CE/AD) |- !scope=\"row\"|1439 |18 January 2018 |16 February 2018 |- !scope=\"row\"|1440 |7 January 2019 |5 February 2019 |- !scope=\"row\"|1441 |27 December 2019 |25 January 2020 |- !scope=\"row\"|1442 |16 December 2020 |13 January 2021 |- !scope=\"row\"|1443 |5 December 2021 |3 January 2022 |- !scope=\"row\"|1444 |25 November 2022 |24 December 2022 |} ==Islamic Events== * On 5 Jumada al-Awwal, Zainab bint Ali was born. * On 8th Jumada al-Awwal, URS Sayyid Amir al-Kulal (RA) Amir Kulal * On 10 Jumada al- Awwal 11AH, Fatima bint Muhammad (Fatima al-Zahra) beloved daughter of Prophet Muhammad died in Medina at the young age of 23 years according to Sunni Muslim sources. * On 12 Jumada al-Awwal 1188, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca which gave Russia jurisdiction over Christians in the empire * On 13 Jumada al-Awwal 11AH, Fatima bint Muhammad was buried by her husband Ali * On 15 Jumada al-Awwal, Ali ibn Husayn (Zayn al-Abideen) was born. * On 20 Jumada al-Awwal 857, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople == See also == * Jumada al-Thani ==References== ==External links== *Islamic-Western Calendar Converter (Based on the Arithmetical or Tabular Calendar) 5 Category:Islamic terminology kk:\u0416\u04af\u043c\u04d9\u0434\u04af\u043b \u04d9\u0443\u0443\u04d9\u043b sv:Jumada-l-Awwal tt:C\u00f6m\u00e4d-\u00e4l- \u00e4w\u00e4l ",
