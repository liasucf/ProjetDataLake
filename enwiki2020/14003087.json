    "text": "U 518 tells of Freygeir's death, but there are two theories on where it was.Freygeirr (Old East Norse: Fr\u00f8yg\u00e6iRR, Modern Swedish: Fr\u00f6ger) was a Viking chieftain who probably led a leidang expedition.Jansson 1980:24 He is considered to have been active in the 1050s on the Baltic coast,Pritsak 1981:357 and he has been identified on six runestones, Gs 13, DR 216, U 518, U 611, U 698 and U 1158.Pritsak 1981:397ff One of the three brothers who is mentioned on the Stenkvista runestone (S\u00f6 111), which is adorned with a heathen symbol (Mj\u00f6lnir), is also called Freygeirr. On the runestone Gs 13, Freygeirr is reported to be the leader of an expedition to Tavastia: :Gs 13: Br\u00fasi had this stone erected in memory of Egill, his brother. And he died in Tafeistaland, when Br\u00fasi brought (= led?) the land's levy(?) (= army) in memory of, his brother. He travelled with Freygeirr. May God and God's mother help his soul. Sveinn and \u00c1smundr, they marked. In Denmark, there is a runestone in memory of a warrior who fell in Sweden while he was in the retinue of a man who was either named Friggir or Freygeirr:Pritsak 1981:399 :DR 216: \u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0r and Hildungr/Hildv\u00edgr/Hildulfr raised this stone in memory of Fra\u00f0i/Fre\u00f0i, their kinsman. And he was then the terror(?) of men. And he died in Sweden and was thereafter the first(?) in(?) Friggir's(?) retinue(?) and then: all vikings. U 698 and U 611 are raised in memory of two men who died in the retinue of a warchief whose name has been reconstructed by runologists as Freygeirr: :U 698: [...] had the stone raised in memory of \u00c1sgeirr, his son. He fell in L\u00edfland, abroad in Freygeirr's(?) retinue.Rundata :U 611: Bj\u00f4rn and Steinfr\u00ed\u00f0r had the stone raised in memory of G\u00edsli. He fell abroad in Freygeirr's(?) retinue. There is also a runestone reporting where Freygeirr died, runestone U 518: :U 518: \u00deorger\u00f0r and Sveinn, they had this stone raised in memory of Ormgeirr and Ormulfr and Freygeirr. He met his end in the sound of Chenotet (Sela\u00f6n), and the others abroad in Greece. May God help their spirits and souls. (\"Greece\"\u2014the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire.) The Rundata project places Freygeir's death near the island of Sela\u00f6n in lake M\u00e4laren. According to another theory the runes isilu represent *isi[s]la and they are to be transcribed as *\u012b ey-s\u0233sla, i.e. \"in \u00d6sel\" (Saaremaa).Pritsak 1981:363 Another runestone mentioning a Freygeirr was raised by his sons: :U 1158: Gu\u00f0steinn(?) and Eistr and ... and \u00c1ki had the stone raised in memory of Freygeirr, their father. L\u00edfsteinn cut these runes. Omeljan Pritsak remarks that Freygeir's son was named Eistr (\"Estonian\") and he connects the name to Freygeir's activities on the other side of the Baltic Sea.Pritsak 1981:400 He further suggests that Freygeir's death took place during a joint Swedish-Kievan Rus' expedition against the Estonians of Saaremaa.Pritsak 1981:400-403 ==Notes== ==Sources== *Jansson, Sven B.
