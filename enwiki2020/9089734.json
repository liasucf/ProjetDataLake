    "text": "The Libyan Palette (also variously known as the City Palette,Lloyd 2010, p. 841. the Libyan Booty Palette, the Libyan Tribute Palette, the Siege Palette, the Tehenu- or Tjehenu Palette) is the surviving lower portion of a stone cosmetic palette bearing carved decoration and hieroglyphic writing. It dates from the Naqada III or Protodynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3200 to 3000 BC). The palette was found at Abydos, Egypt. The palette is made of schist and it is 19 cm long and 22 cm wide. Housed in Room 43 on the ground floor of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo,Egyptian Museum Official website, Libyan Palette article , accessed 8 June 2007. its Journal d'Entr\u00e9e number is JE27434 and its Catalogue G\u00e9n\u00e9ral number is CG14238. ==Content== Early character for \"Libya\" on the Libyan Palette On one side, there is a scene of walking lines of animals within registers.Stephan Seidlmayer 1998, p. 28.Fragment of The Tehenu palette \"Libyan Tribute\" tablet, official website of The Grand Egyptian MuseumWilkinson 1999, p. 137. Below these animals, an orchard with olive trees is depicted, and the hieroglyphic inscription thnw or tjehenw (usually transcribed as tehenu), most likely a toponym of Western Nile Delta or, according to most scholars, what was later associated with Libya. The character consists in the throwing stick on top of an oval, meaning \"region\", \"place\", \"island\", a toponym of Libya or Western Delta pronouced THnw, Tjehenw. The opposite side of the Libyan Palette shows the feet of some persons above a register line. Under the register, seven fortified towns are depicted, with the name of each town written within the wall. Above each town, an animal grasps its wall with the mr (hoe) hieroglyph. G\u00fcnter Dreyer has interpreted this scene as a scene of destruction and the animals, or animal standards, as royal names.Wilkinson 1999, p. 42. However, other scholars have suggested that the animals represent royal armies or symbols. Another completely different interpretation is that the scene represents the foundation of these cities.Abeer El-Shahawy 2010, p. 20. ==See also== *List of ancient Egyptian palettes *Cosmetic palette ==References== ==Sources== * Abeer El-Shahawy.
