He was sired by the British-born sire Ornus, a son of Bend Or, a two-time leading broodmare sire in Great Britain & Ireland who was imported to stand at stud in the United States. New York Times - August 24, 1910 Olambala's dam was Blue and White, a daughter of the 1885 leading sire in North America, Virgil. Owned by Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr. and raced under the name of his Montpelier Stable, Olambala was conditioned for racing by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Thomas J. Healey. ==Racing career== The colt won important races at age three including the 1909 Latonia Derby and equaled the track record at Saratoga Race Course for a mile and three quarters in winning the Saratoga Cup.
