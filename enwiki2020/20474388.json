    "text": "The Lax\u2013Friedrichs method, named after Peter Lax and Kurt O. Friedrichs, is a numerical method for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations based on finite differences. The method can be described as the FTCS (forward in time, centered in space) scheme with a numerical dissipation term of 1/2. One can view the Lax\u2013Friedrichs method as an alternative to Godunov's scheme, where one avoids solving a Riemann problem at each cell interface, at the expense of adding artificial viscosity. ==Illustration for a Linear Problem== Consider a one-dimensional, linear hyperbolic partial differential equation for u(x,t) of the form: : u_t + au_x = 0\\, on the domain : b \\leq x \\leq c,\\; 0 \\leq t \\leq d with initial condition : u(x,0) = u_0(x)\\, and the boundary conditions : u(b,t) = u_b(t)\\, : u(c,t) = u_c(t).\\, If one discretizes the domain (b, c) \\times (0, d) to a grid with equally spaced points with a spacing of \\Delta x in the x-direction and \\Delta t in the t-direction, we define : u_i^n = u(x_i, t^n) \\text{ with } x_i = b + i\\,\\Delta x ,\\, t^n = n\\,\\Delta t \\text{ for } i = 0,\\ldots,N ,\\, n = 0,\\ldots,M, where : N = \\frac{c - b}{\\Delta x} ,\\, M = \\frac{d}{\\Delta t} are integers representing the number of grid intervals. Then the Lax\u2013Friedrichs method for solving the above partial differential equation is given by: : \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}^n + u_{i-1}^n)}{\\Delta t} + a\\frac{u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n}{2\\,\\Delta x} = 0 Or, rewriting this to solve for the unknown u_i^{n+1}, : u_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}^n + u_{i-1}^n) - a\\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\,\\Delta x}(u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\\, Where the initial values and boundary nodes are taken from : u_i^0 = u_0(x_i) : u_0^n = u_b(t^n) : u_N^n = u_c(t^n). == Extensions to Nonlinear Problems == A nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law is defined through a flux function f : : u_t + ( f(u) )_x = 0. In the case of f(u) = a u , we end up with a scalar linear problem. Note that in general, u is a vector with m equations in it. The generalization of the Lax- Friedrichs method to nonlinear systems takes the formLeVeque, Randall J. Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws\", Birkhauser Verlag, 1992, p. 125. : u_i^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i+1}^n + u_{i-1}^n) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2\\,\\Delta x}( f( u_{i+1}^n ) - f( u_{i-1}^n ) ). This method is conservative and first order accurate, hence quite dissipative. It can, however be used as a building block for building high-order numerical schemes for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, much like Euler time steps can be used as a building block for creating high-order numerical integrators for ordinary differential equations. We note that this method can be written in conservation form: : u_i^{n+1} = u^n_i - \\frac{\\Delta t}{ \\Delta x} \\left( \\hat{f}^n_{i+1/2} - \\hat{f}^n_{i-1/2} \\right), where : \\hat{f}^n_{i-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( f_{i-1} + f_{i} \\right) - \\frac{ \\Delta x}{ 2 \\Delta t } \\left( u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1} \\right). Without the extra terms u^n_i and u^n_{i-1} in the discrete flux, \\hat{f}^n_{i-1/2} , one ends up with the FTCS scheme, which is well known to be unconditionally unstable for hyperbolic problems. ==Stability and accuracy== Example problem initial condition Lax-Friedrichs solution This method is explicit and first order accurate in time and first order accurate in space ( O(\\Delta t) + O(\\frac{\\Delta x^2}{\\Delta t})) provided u_0(x),\\, u_b(t),\\, u_c(t) are sufficiently-smooth functions. Under these conditions, the method is stable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: : \\left| a\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\right| \\leq 1. (A von Neumann stability analysis can show the necessity of this stability condition.) The Lax\u2013Friedrichs method is classified as having second-order dissipation and third order dispersion . For functions that have discontinuities, the scheme displays strong dissipation and dispersion ; see figures at right. ==References== * . * . * . * Category:Numerical differential equations Category:Computational fluid dynamics ",
