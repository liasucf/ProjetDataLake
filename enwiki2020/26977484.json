Under the team's Head coach Claude Le Roy, Zhao was given his chance to establish himself in the 2003 league season and despite Cheng Yaodong coming in as Claude Le Roy's replacement during the season Zhao would still establish himself as part of the team that saw the club just miss out in the league title to Shanghai Shenhua by a single point. Zhao continued to develop as a defender for the team and remained loyal to the club even when they decided to move to Shaanxi and rename themselves. After becoming a vital member within the team Zhao left the club in 2009 to join second tier club Nanchang Bayi where he was re-teamed with Zhu Jiong who was a former assistant coach at Zhao's previous club. The move turned out to be a successful one when Nanchang came second in the division and promotion to the top tier. In January 2015, Zhao transferred to China League One side Nei Mongol Zhongyou.\u547c\u548c\u6d69\u7279\u4e2d\u4f18\u6295\u5165\u5df2\u8d854000\u4e07 at sports.163.com 2015-01-28 Retrieved 2016-01-13 On 13 January 2016, Zhao returned to Shanghai Shenxin.\u547c\u548c\u6d69\u7279\u4e2d\u536b\u52a0\u76df\u4e0a\u6d77\u7533\u946b at sports.sina.com 2016-01-13 Retrieved 2016-01-13 ==Club career statistics== Statistics accurate as of match played 3 November 2018.\u8d75\u4f5c\u5cfb at sodasoccer Retrieved 2015-11-01 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Season!!Team!!Country!!Division!!Apps!!Goals |- |2002||align=\"left\"|Shanghai COSCO Huili||align=\"left\"|||1||0||0 |- |2003||align=\"left\"|Shanghai International||align=\"left\"|||1||20||0 |- |2004||align=\"left\"|Shanghai International||align=\"left\"|||1||21||1 |- |2005||align=\"left\"|Shanghai International||align=\"left\"|||1||15||0 |- |2006||align=\"left\"|Inter Xian||align=\"left\"|||1||13||1 |- |2007||align=\"left\"|Shaanxi||align=\"left\"|||1||26||0 |- |2008||align=\"left\"|Shaanxi||align=\"left\"|||1||27||0 |- |2009||align=\"left\"|Nanchang Bayi||align=\"left\"|||2||17||0 |- |2010||align=\"left\"|Nanchang Bayi||align=\"left\"|||1||28||0 |- |2011||align=\"left\"|Nanchang Bayi||align=\"left\"|||1||29||0 |- |2012||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||1||15||0 |- |2013||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||1||9||0 |- |2014||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||1||6||0 |- |2014||align=\"left\"|Taiyuan Zhongyou Jiayi||align=\"left\"|||3||12||4 |- |2015||align=\"left\"|Nei Mongol Zhongyou||align=\"left\"|||2||26||0 |- |2016||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||2||28||0 |- |2017||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||2||23||0 |- |2018||align=\"left\"|Shanghai Shenxin||align=\"left\"|||2||2||0 |} ==References== ==External links== *Player stats at sohu.com * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Footballers from Shanghai Category:Beijing Renhe F.C. players Category:Shanghai Shenxin F.C. players Category:Inner Mongolia Zhongyou F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:Association football defenders ",
