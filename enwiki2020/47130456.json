    "text": "Iconophobia (literally fear of icons) refers to an aversion to images, especially religious icons. Iconophobia is differentiated from iconoclasm in that iconophobia refers to the aversion to or hatred of the images whereas iconoclasm refers to the actual destruction of images that may arise from iconophobia.

But it is the Protestant Reformation that is most associated with iconophobia: \u201cThe Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517, brought iconophobia to the forefront of contemporary politics... Iconophobia was pushed to its extreme in the teachings of John Calvin... Protestant iconophobia had a huge and not exclusively negative impact on aesthetics and the history of art. It permanently affected the ways images were made, exhibited, and judged.\u201d __TOC__ ==Iconophobia and the English Reformation== The leading historian of English Protestantism, Patrick Collinson, applied the term iconophobia to a specific period in post- Reformation England in his 1985 Stenton Lecture, From Iconoclasm to Iconophobia: the Cultural Impact of the Second English Reformation. The arguments also informed chapter 4 of his 1988 book, The Birthpangs of Protestant England. Collinson\u2019s work has shaped a generation of scholarly enquiry into the impact of religion on culture, and of culture on religion, in post-reformation England. Scholars have accepted, rejected, and modified Collinson\u2019s arguments, but one way or another they continue to exert a powerful influence over reformation studies. Collinson carefully re-defined iconoclasm (generally defined as \u201cthe destruction of religious icons and other images or monuments for religious or political motives\u201d) in his essay as follows: > \u201cThe first generation of Protestant publicists and propagandists, the > Edwardian generation, made polemical and creative use of cultural vehicles > which their spiritual children and grandchildren later repudiated, as part > of their rather general programme of rejection. They wrote and staged > Protestant plays. They sang Protestant songs and godly ballads to secular > and popular tunes.

These strategies constitute, for my purpose, what is meant by > Iconoclasm ... Iconoclasm in this sense may imply the substitution of other, > acceptable images, or the refashioning of some images for an altered > purpose.\u201d Iconophobia, by comparison, is defined as \u201cthe total repudiation of all images\u201d, which Collinson associates with a watershed moment around 1580, introducing a \u201csudden and drastic\u201d change. This \u201csecondary thrust\u201d of reform \u201ccame close to dispensing with images and the mimetic altogether, while disparaging the tastes and capacities of the illiterate, the mass of the people\u201d. Collinson describes the \u201cage of extreme iconophobia\u201d as \u201cquite short, equivalent to little more than a single generation\u201d. Nevertheless, much subsequent scholarship has suggested that iconophobia characterised post- Reformation Protestantism from 1580 onwards. ==References== Category:Phobias ",
