    "text": "St. George's School (informally: Saints) is an independent boarding and day university-preparatory school for boys, founded in 1930 in Vancouver, British Columbia. == History == St. George's Junior School St. George's was founded in 1930 by a group of Englishmen recently arrived in British Columbia. Captain John Harker, serving from 1943 to 1962, was its second and one of the most influential headmasters of St. George's School. The original school operated out of a large country manor house. It has since expanded dramatically, and the school now maintains two campuses; the Senior School, on land leased from UBC in 1925, and the Junior School, converted from the former Convent of the Sacred Heart, a historic property purchased in 1979, which had formerly served as a Catholic all-girls school. The school continues to expand to this day, the most recent updates being the renovation of the Junior School Campus. Currently, there is a campus \"masterplan\" set which includes the demolition of the current Senior School Building and creating a completely redesigned Senior campus. == Students == The student body at St. George's comprises 1,151 boys from 22 countries, with approximately 750 boys in the Senior School and the remainder in the Junior School. As of June 2016, 109 students were boarding students. Like other independent schools, it maintains a system of prefects and mandates the wearing of uniforms. School Captain and other prefects are elected by the faculty and their fellow students to provide student leaders with the School. Past School Captains and other prefects have included Rhodes Scholars, diplomats, prominent lawyers and businessmen, and professional athletes. The uniform, as is frequently the case in similar Canadian schools, includes an emblazoned blazer, grey flannels, and the wearing of the appropriate school tie. The school ties vary depending on extracurricular achievement and on grade. Students in grades 1\u20136 wear a striped red, white, and black tie, students in grade 7 wear a blue one, those in grades 8\u201311 wear a darker blue one with the school's crest on it, and those in grade 12 wear a red tie. Those who have attended since Grade 1 are called \"Lifers\". == Academics == St. George's School emphasizes academic performance as well as the building of moral character, and the formation of strong, upstanding traits. The school offers a variety of academic options that include enriched and advanced-placement classes. Advanced Placement courses from the College Board are generally offered starting in 11th Grade. In the 2016-2017 school year, senior school students wrote 357 AP Exams, and 159 students wrote at least one exam.

Approximately 80% of students play in a competitive team. To encourage students to live a healthy life and build character, the school mandates that its boys select a recreational or competitive sport starting from Grade 8.
