It is a significant example of Ottoman bridge architecture in the Balkans, and is a listed National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina ==History== The bridge was built between 1682 and 1683 by Ali-aga Hase\u010di\u0107 (as commemorated by a stone plaque at the center span) atop six slightly-pointed stone arches. In March 1945, the bridge's deck was destroyed by explosive charges laid by the retreating German army. While the arches suffered heavy damage, all five piers survived, preserving the bridge's basic structural integrity and permitting eventual reconstruction. After World War II, the Yugoslav government decided to temporarily repair the bridge for basic use, with a makeshift deck made of iron beams laid across the still-intact masonry piers supporting a one-lane tarmac for motorized vehicle traffic. This temporarily solution lasted for more than five decades, until after the Yugoslav Wars. The bridge was restored to its original appearance with European financial assistance between 2003 and 2009, and is once again a landmark of Ottoman architecture in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
