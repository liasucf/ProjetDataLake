Duhanov with the 49th and Special Rifle Corps as well as assigned aviation units.9th Army, Red Army, 30.11.1939 9th Army was initially tasked with the capture of Kajaani and Oulu. Two divisions attached to the army, the 44th and 163rd Rifle Divisions, were defeated by the Finns during the Battle of Suomussalmi. It appears to have been disbanded after the end of the war. === Second formation === In 1940 the Army was created to take part in the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. It was disbanded on 10 July 1940. === Third formation === By 1941 the Army was designated the 9th Separate Army (briefly) and included the 14th, 35th and 48th Rifle Corps (the last under then General Major Rodion Malinovsky), 2nd Cavalry Corps, 2nd and 18th Mechanised Corps, 80th, 81st, 82nd, 84th, 86th Fortified Regions and a number of other units - the biggest army on the Soviet border before the German Operation Barbarossa began. However, it was more an administrative than an operational formation on 22 June 1941.John Erickson (historian), The Road to Stalingrad, 2003 Cassel Military Paperbacks edition, p.141 With General Major M.V. Zakharov as chief of staff, it was tasked to cover the Beltsa, Kishinev, and Odessa approaches as part of General Ivan Tyulenev\u2019s Southern Front. The first engagement came when Von Schobert\u2019s Eleventh Army crashed into the juncture of 9th and 18th Armies. North of Jassy, the German assault fell on the 48th Rifle Corps which was covering Beltsa. Tyulenev ordered a counterattack, and soon 48th Rifle and 2nd Cavalry Corps plus 2nd Mechanised Corps from Southern Front reserve were engaged at Beltsa and Stefanesti. Tyulenev then drew off 25th, 51st, and 150th Rifle Divisions from two of Zakharov\u2019s rifle corps to form a new \u2018Coastal Group\u2019 to cover the eastern bank of the Prut River, the northern bank of the Danube and the Black Sea coast.Erickson, 2003, p.168 (This group later became the Separate Coastal Army). By early August, 9th Army was falling back to Nikolayev under repeated German blows, and by 17 August across the River Ingulets and over to the eastern bank of the Dnieper. The \u2018Coastal Group\u2019 was meanwhile falling back on Odessa. By early 9 October Army was falling back on Taganrog, after a failed attempt by Southern Front's three armies to hold a line between Pavlograd and the Sea of Azov had been shattered by an outflanking maneuver by Von Kleist's newly renamed First Panzer Army.Erickson, 2003, p.255-6, 265 The resulting Battle of the Sea of Azov shattered 9th Army, virtually destroying it. The Soviets\u2019 next move was a planned offensive orchestrated by Timoshenko, GlavKom Southwest. After still more retreats and the loss of Rostov, 9th Army stepped off on 17 November as part of an assault by both Southern and Southwestern Fronts, and by 29 November, 9th Army in conjunction with 56th Army and other units had cleared Rostov and the city was back in Soviet hands. 9th Army then joined Timoshenko's strategic reserve, to join the battle again when the Barvenkovo\u2013Lozovaya Offensive operation began.Erickson, 2003, p.328-9 9th Army joined this assault in January 1942 when it broke into the German front on the northern Donets along with 6th and 57th Armies, reaching the line Balakleya-Lozovaia-Slavyansk before being halted by repeated German counterattacks. Still with Southern Front, 9th Army was then allotted a subsidiary part in the Kharkov offensive \u2013 the Second Battle of Kharkov \u2013 which kicked off in May 1942. Along with 57th Army, 9th Army was tasked to secure the southern part of the Izyum bulge in the front. While being in a secondary sector, 9th Army took much of the force of the German response, Operation Fridericus.Erickson, 2003, p.346-7 Eight hours into the German counterstroke, at noon on 17 May, elements of the First Panzer and Seventeenth Armies were ten miles into 9th Army's positions and threatening the neighbouring 57th Army's rear. Commander, Southern Front, General Lieutenant R. Ya. Malinovskii, at once drew 5th Cavalry Corps, a rifle division, and a tank brigade out of reserve in an attempt to halt Von Kleist. However discussions and decisions at Stavka about breaking off the Kharkov offensive in response did not come quickly enough, and 6th and 57th Armies were surrounded in the Izyum pocket with the loss of 200,000 plus men in casualties alone. Later, as part of the North Caucasian and Transcaucasian Fronts, the Army fought on the big bend of the river Don (in the summer of 1942), and participated in the Battle of the Caucasus. In November 1943 the army headquarters was disbanded, and its formations and units transferred to other armies. ==Commanders== *Komkor Mikhail Dukhanov (21 November \u2013 22 December 1939) *Komkor Vasily Chuikov (22 December 1939 \u2013 5 April 1940) *Lieutenant General Ivan Boldin (20 June \u2013 10 July 1940) *Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko (22 June \u2013 9 September 1941) *Major General Fyodor Kharitonov (9 September 1941 \u2013 20 May 1942) *Major General Pyotr Kozlov (20 May \u2013 18 June 1942) *Major General Dmitry Nikishov (18\u201324 June 1942) *Lieutenant General Anton Lopatin (24 June \u2013 17 July 1942) *Major General Feofan Parkhomenko (14 July \u2013 7 August 1942) *Major General Vladimir Marcinkiewicz (8\u201328 August 1942) *Major General (Lieutenant General April 1943) Konstantin Koroteev (September 1942 \u2013 February 1943) *Major General Vasily Glagolev (11 February \u2013 22 March 1943) *Lieutenant General Konstantin Koroteev (March\u2013May 1943) *Major General (Lieutenant General October 1943) Aleksei Grechkin (June\u2013November 1943) == Order of Battle, 22 June 1941 == Note: This order of battle disagrees in the matter of the 150th Rifle Division with material from David Glantz, Stumbling Colossus *14th Rifle Corps (General Major D.
