    "text": "* In the Hindu varna system, Brahmakshatriya may refer to a Brahmin who pursues royalty, and hence concurrently adopts the Kshatriya varna or those Kshatriya who had adopted Brahmin varna because of Parashurama.According to Manusmriti, such people are treated equal to Brahmins. * In \u2018Vyoma Samhita\u2019 Madhavacharya says- :Bramhakaya samadbhooto kayastho bramhasangyakah;Kalowhi kshatriyah tasya japyagye surajanam. :This shloka clearly states that Kayasthas were having the rights of both Brahmin and Kshatriyas and that is the reason they were called the Bramha Kshatriya/Vratya Kshatriyas in all the old testimonials. * In Kerala, only the sons of a Nambuthiri father and a Kshatriya mother were recognised as Brahmakshatriya by the Nambuthiri Brahmins, while the son of a Brahmakshatriya father and a non-Kshatriya mother was regarded as non-Kshatriya. The Nairs and Samantha Kshatriyas of Kerala are examples of Brahmkshatriyas by descent, while the Nambiathiri and Nambidi sect of Nambudiri Brahmins are Brahmkshatriyas by virtue of adopting a martial tradition. ==Brahmakshatriya Dynasty== * Sena Dynasty:The founder of the Sena rule was Samantasena who described himself as a Brahma-Kshatriya of Karnataka (Karnataka). He himself stated that he fought the outlaws of Karnataka and later turned an ascetic. The inscriptions of the Sena kings mention them as Brahma-Kshatriyas (Brahmins who ruled as Kshatriyas) or Kshatriyas. ==See also== * Pushpaka Brahmin * Kayastha * Chitraguptavanshi Kayastha * Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu * Nair * Malla Kshatriya * Nambidi ==References== Category:Kshatriya Category:Brahmins ",
