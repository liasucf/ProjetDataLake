Barton reviewed Hydronaut in The Space Gamer No. 46. Barton commented that \"if you don't mind fiddling around with some areas and making up your own data to cover what is missing, you might find the idea behind Hydronauts worthy of your attention \u2013 especially if you're one of those refs who doesn't always have the time necessary to create your own adventures from scratch. If you haven't liked G1's past efforts, though, you probably won't like this one, either.\" ==References== Category:Traveller (role-playing game) adventures ",
