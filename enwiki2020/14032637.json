He studied in the Khwarezmean madrassah. He wrote his immortal poem in 1233. He was probably killed in 1236 during the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria. ==Legacy== His poems are celebrated by the Tatars, the Bashkirs and the Chuvash. Q\u00edssa-i Yos\u0131f (\u0642\u0635\u0647 \u06cc\u0648\u0633\u0641) was inspired by Qur'anic stories of Joseph. The poem is devoted to the struggle against evil and for human happiness.
