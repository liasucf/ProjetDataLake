Prominent in the state's Murchison and Mid West regions, he served a single six-year term in parliament. Mills was born at Narra Tarra, a locality on the Chapman River, near Geraldton. Before standing for parliament, he worked variously as an inspector of stock, a sheep farmer (at Narra Tarra), a station manager (at Wurarga, Barnong, and Gabyon), and an Agricultural Bank inspector.(24 March 1943). \"LATE MR. JOSHUA MILLS\" \u2013 Geraldton Guardian. Mills stood as an \"independent Nationalist\" candidate for Central Province at the 1918 Legislative Council elections.Black, David, and Bolton, Geoffrey (1990). Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia: Volume One (1870\u20131930) , p. 139. He defeated Labor's John Drew, who had become personally unpopular in the seat. Mills' age (he was 59 when he first stood for office) led to him being nicknamed \"Uncle Joe\" by The Sunday Times.For instance, in \"Notes and Comments\" (19 May 1918), \"PEEPS at PEOPLE\" (16 June 1918), and \"THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS\" (25 April 1920). After briefly joining the Ministerial Country Party in 1923 (a Country Party splinter group), Mills stood as an endorsed Nationalist candidate at the 1924 election, but was defeated by Drew. He stood again in 1926, but was defeated by Country candidate George Kempton.(11 March 1926). \"Central Province Election.\" \u2013 Geraldton Guardian. After losing his seat, Mills farmed with his son at Waggrakine. He had married Hannah Maley in 1892, and the couple had one son and one daughter together, but she died in childbirth in 1905.\"The Children of John & Elizabeth Maley\" \u2013 Greenough Museum. Retrieved 29 March 2015. Her brothers, Charles and Henry Maley, were both later members of the Legislative Assembly (for Irwin and Greenough, respectively).Black and Bolton (1990), p. 133. Mills' own sister, Harriet Mills, was married to Everard Darlot, who was the inaugural MLA for Murchison.Black and Bolton (1990), p. 58. He was consequently the brother-in-law of three other MPs in Western Australia. Mills died in Geraldton in 1943, aged 84, and was buried at Narra Tarra. ==References== Category:1859 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Australian farmers Category:Independent members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:People from the Mid West (Western Australia) ",
