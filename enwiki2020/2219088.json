    "text": "Re-erection of the Vatican Obelisk by the Renaissance architect Domenico Fontana in 1586 The city of Rome harbours the most obelisks in the world. There are eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks in Rome, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also until 2005 an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome. The Romans used special heavy cargo carriers called obelisk ships to transport the monuments down the Nile to Alexandria and from there across the Mediterranean Sea to Rome. On site, large Roman cranes were employed to erect the monoliths. == Ancient Egyptian obelisks == At least eight obelisks created in antiquity by the Egyptians were taken from Egypt after the Roman conquest and brought to Rome. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
