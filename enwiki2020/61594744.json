    "text": "Macacine gammaherpesvirus 4 (McHV-4), commonly known as rhesus lymphocryptovirus (RLV), is a species of virus in the genus Lymphocryptovirus, subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae, and order Herpesvirales. In nature, Macacine gammaherpesvirus 4 infects rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). ==Comparison with Human gammaherpesvirus 4== Its genetic structure has been fully sequenced and found to be highly homologous with that of Human gammaherpesvirus 4, commonly known as Epstein-Barr virus, at 65%. The structural proteins are highly conserved, while genes expressed during Human gammaherpesvirus 4 latent infection are much less well conserved. Even in cases where genes have low homology, the Macacine gammaherpesvirus 4 infection genes are functionally interchangeable with Human gammaherpesvirus 4 genes. Macacine gammaherpesvirus 4 infection in rhesus monkeys resembles Human gammaherpesvirus 4 infection in humans in several respects: * Oral transmission, * Atypical lymphocytosis * Lymphadenopathy * Activation of CD23+ peripheral blood B cells * Sustained serologic responses to lytic and latent Human gammaherpesvirus 4 antigens * Latent infection in the peripheral blood * Virus persistence in oropharyngeal secretions These features make the rhesus lymphocryptovirus potentially useful for studying the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of Human gammaherpesvirus 4 infection and associated oncogenesis. ==References== Category:Gammaherpesvirinae ",
