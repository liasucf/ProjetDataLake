Opened in 1955 by John and Esther Fricano, Storybook Land is located on U.S. Route 322, two miles west of exit 37 on the Garden State Parkway. The park is themed after many storybook characters such as Mother Goose, the Three Little Pigs, and many more. Some of its most prominent attractions are the J&J; Railroad Train (which loops around most of the park), the Happy Dragon, and Whily Bug the Ferris wheel. The Land of Make Believe (not to be confused with the amusement park of the same name in Hope Township, New Jersey) has many of the standard amusement park rides such as Bubbles the Coaster, a junior sized roller coaster, and the TurtleTwirl, a Tilt-A-Whirl. Storybook Land also has a Santa Claus house where Santa and Mrs. Claus will pose with the children during the Christmas season. ==Visiting the park== Storybook Land has several counter-service restaurants and a large, covered picnic area for bringing a meal from home. During the months of April and May, the park is heavily visited by school groups. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1955 establishments in New Jersey Category:Amusement parks in New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Atlantic County, New Jersey Category:Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey Category:U.S. Route 322 Category:Tourist attractions in Atlantic County, New Jersey Category:Amusement parks opened in 1955 ",
