His sons included Toki Masafusa and Toki Motoyori. After becoming a priest later in life, his name was changed to Muneyasu (\u5b97\u5b89). His remains are at Zuiry\u016b-ji in the city of Gifu. == Rise to power == When Mochimasu's eldest son, Toki Mochikane (\u571f\u5c90\u6301\u517c) died, Mochikane's son was selected to be the next shugo (governor) of Mino Province. However, Sait\u014d Toshinaga, a shugodai (vice-governor), pushed Shigeyori to be the next shugo. At the time, Shigeyori was a member of the related Isshiki clan, but was adopted by Mochimasu and succeeded him in 1467. This is one of the many examples during the middle part of the Muromachi period in which the shugodai usurped the power of the shugo; the Sait\u014d clan even had its own power usurped later on. In 1467, Shigeyori fought for the western armies in the \u014cnin War. He commanded a group of 8,000 men and fought with the forces stationed in Kyoto; his actions protected the life of Sait\u014d My\u014dchin, the current shugodai of Mino Province.

Because there were fears that the eastern armies would be able to take control of an influence the bakufu, the western armies worked to gain organize and join with powerful shrines and other strong groups. Through this, My\u014dchin was able to extend his power to Owari, Ise, \u014cmi and Hida provinces and Shigeyori was able to exert more influence over the western armies. == Return to Mino Province == In 1477, after the end of the \u014cnin War, Shigeyori gave sanctuary to Ashikaga Yoshimi and his son Ashikaga Yoshitane, the nominal heads of the western armies, he returned home to Mino Province. Yoshimi and Yoshitane spent the following eleven years living in Kawate Castle. After My\u014dchin died in 1480, Sait\u014d My\u014djun and Sait\u014d Toshifuji fought for the right to succeed My\u014dchin. My\u014djun won and further strengthened the power of the Sait\u014d clan. ==References== Category:Daimyo Category:1442 births Category:1497 deaths ",
