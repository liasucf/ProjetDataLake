It begins with Bureau of Corrections Director General Nicanor Faeldon and several other government officials signing the document containing the release of former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of Eileen Sarmenta and her friend Allan Gomez in 1993, and the release of Josman Aznar, Ariel Balansag, Alberto Ca\u00f1o and James Anthony Uy, the 4 suspects in the rape and murder of sisters Marijoy and Jacqueline Chiong in 1997, citing \"good conduct.\" The aftermath of release of convicts through GCTA subsequently led to investigation regarding the GCTA and to the BuCor personnel involved in the controversy. ==Background== The Good Conduct Time Allowance bill, also known as Republic Act No. 10592, was approved by the Congress and was signed by then-President Benigno Aquino III on May 29, 2013. ==Controversies== 180px ===Planned release of Antonio Sanchez=== In August 2019, news reports stated that former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez, the suspect of raping and murdering Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez in 1993, could have walked free from prison after spending 25 years in prison, according to a document bearing the signature of Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon. The document said the release order was for one Antonio Leyza Sanchez, \"who was found to have served 40 years upon retroactive application of RA No. 10592 and was certified to have no other legal cause to be further detained, shall be released from confinement.\" RA 10592 is the law allowing convicts an early release based on good conduct time allowance (GCTA).

Note: At 5:20 A social media post also claimed that Sanchez is spotted in his house in Calauan, Laguna two months ago. The impending release of Sanchez sparked nationwide outrage and condemnation. Prior to the issue, questions were raised over how could he qualify for good conduct when he was caught of seizing various items inside the prison such as P1.5 million worth of methamphetamine (shabu) hidden in a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 2010 and an air-conditioning unit and flat-screen TV in 2015. Despite the outrage, BuCor Director General Nicanor Faeldon has changed tune and said Sanchez may be disqualified from the good conduct and time allowance (GCTA) rule based on several grounds. On August 23, University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, the alma mater of Sarmenta and Gomez, held a rally to oppose the Sanchez's release. Among there present is the mother of Allan Gomez. Despite the Duterte administration denies the role of Sanchez release, Duterte's name can be seen written on their placards. The Supreme Court of the Philippines (SC), in a statement by spokesperson Brian Hosaka, denied ordering the release of Sanchez when it ruled on the retroactive application of RA 10592. Sanchez has maintained his innocence for the 1993 rape-slay of Sarmenta and the murder of Gomez and said he deserved to be freed. On August 26, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra and Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon not to release convicted rapist-murderer Antonio Sanchez.

Senator Risa Hontiveros said that there are indications of GCTA system \"is being corrupted\" like the case of Sanchez. On September 3, 2019, The family of rape and murder convict and former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez showed up at the Senate for the resumption of the probe into the controversy surrounding the possible release of their patriarch. The Sanchez family has maintain their intention that they will not pay the \u20b112.6-million court-mandated damages to the families of Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez who were murdered in 1993. Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP) executive director Reynaldo Bayang revealed in a Senate inquiry that Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo, who served as Sanchez's defense counsel in the high-profile 1993 Sarmenta-Gomez rape-slay case, wrote the BPP regarding Sanchez's application for executive clemency in a letter dated February 26. Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo has confirmed a meeting with the family of his former client, convicted rapist- killer Antonio Sanchez, in Malaca\u00f1ang earlier this year. President Rodrigo Duterte has fired Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon after the latter approved the release of Sanchez. ===The release of Chiong murders suspects=== On August 30, 2019, Senator Panfilo Lacson stated that some of the convicts of the 1997 murder of the Chiong sisters are now out of prison. Faeldon has confirmed the release of Josman Aznar, Ariel Balansag, Alberto Ca\u00f1o and James Anthony Uy, the four persons who were convicted for the 1997 murder of the Chiong sisters.

The grounds of the urgent motion stated that Pemberton should have been released from prison on July 31st, 2020 after serving more than half of his 10-year sentence for displaying good conduct. This basis was provided by computations done by the BuCor, showing that the former US Marine has served a total sentence of eight years and ten months. In addition to this, Flores also stated that the BuCor did not give Pemberton any good conduct time allowances (GCTA) for over a year from October 22nd, 2014, to November 2015, stating that Pemberton did not receive any GCTA credits for the actual time he served from October 22 to December 18 in 2014, and for the months of June and July in 2020. However, the Laude family is opposed to the early release of Pemberton, stating that Pemberton was placed under solitary confinement, which does not count towards GCTA accreditation, and thus could not reasonably and justifiably claim good conduct. Aside from the Laude family, the pardon sparked outrage in the LGBT community, as well as high- profile personalities from senators to celebrities. The hashtag #JusticeForJenniferLaude landed on the top trending spot in social media, where majority of the posts were critical of Duterte. Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte officially gave Pemberton an absolute pardon on September 7, 2020.
