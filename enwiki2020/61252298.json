K-192's western terminus is at U.S. Route 59 (US-59) and K-16 west-northwest of Winchester and the eastern terminus is at US-73 and K-7 west-northwest of Leavenworth. K-192 travels mostly through rural land but does pass through the cities of Winchester and Easton. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, the former George Washington National Highway and King of Trails followed the highways eastern terminus. K-192 was first designated a state highway on January 4, 1939. In 1964, the western terminus was shortened slightly when a new alignment of US-59 was built, and then in 1999, the eastern terminus was shortened when US-73 was moved to a new alignment. ==Route description== The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 625 vehicles per day slightly east of Winchester to 2280 vehicles per day near the eastern terminus. K-192 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility.
