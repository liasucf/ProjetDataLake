It followed the passage of the Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903, fought for by Cork MP William O'Brien of the Irish Parliamentary Party. In this he was opposed by his colleagues in the party for having achieved Land Reform before Home Rule. In disgust, O'Brien closed his newspaper the Irish People and resigned his seat on 1 January 1904. Eventually the writ was moved to fill the vacant seat and O'Brien was nominated. William O'Brien was returned unopposed.
