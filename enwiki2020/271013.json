    "text": "The minister of science and sport, formerly the minister of science, was an office in the Cabinet of Canada that originally existing from 1990 to 1995 and was brought back in 2008, and again becoming vacant after the 2019 federal election, with the portfolio's responsibilities being absorbed into the innovation, science and industry portfolio. == History == Prior to 1990, the responsibilities of the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio were divided between the now-defunct post of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and a Minister of State for Science and Technology. In 1995, the portfolio was merged with that of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to create the post of Minister of Industry. In the appointments to the Cabinet of Canada of October 30, 2008 under Stephen Harper, the portfolio was reintroduced as a Minister of State and given to Gary Goodyear. === Trudeau government === In 2015, Kirsty Duncan was appointed a minister of state styled as \"Minister of Science\" to assist the minister of industry (the senior portfolio was also restyled the minister of innovation, science and economic development). Duncan's portfolio was expected to oversee basic research, while Navdeep Bains would oversee applied science. In July 2018, the office's portfolio was expanded, being renamed to \"Minister of Science and Sport\". Following the 2019 federal election, the portfolio became vacant and Navdee Bains' portfolio was expanded - he was appointed as the minister of innovation, science and industry. His previous portfolio was called innovation, science and economic development. ==Ministers== Key: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 1055px\" |- ! colspan=7| === Minister of State (Science and Technology) (1971\u20131990) === |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 55px;\"| Portrait ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\"| Name ! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 |Term of office ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"| Political party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"| Ministry ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\"| Note |- | 50px || Alastair William Gillespie || 12 Aug. 1971 || 26 Nov. 1972 | rowspan=6 style=\"background:\"| Liberal | rowspan=6|20 (P.
