    "text": "\"Stay Gold\" is a song by South Korean boy band BTS, and the lead single from their fourth Japanese studio album, Map of the Soul: 7 \u2013 The Journey. It was digitally pre-released on June 19, 2020 as part of the lead up to the album's debut on July 14. The song also serves as the original soundtrack for TV Tokyo's drama series Spiral Labyrinth \u2013 DNA Forensic Investigation. It was produced by UTA, who also co-wrote the track together with Sunny Boy, Melanie Fontana, Michel Schulz, JUN, and KM-MARKIT. == Background and release == On March 26, Billboard Japan reported that a new BTS song, titled \"Stay Gold\", had been selected as the theme for then upcoming Japanese television drama, Spiral Labyrinth\u2013DNA Forensic Investigation (Rasen no Meiky\u016b\u2013DNA Kagaku S\u014dsa). Billboard Japan also claimed the song would be part of a new BTS album to be released in the summer, and quoted the band's description of the track as a \"bright song with expressive lyrics that anyone can easily relate to\". It is the band's first Japanese drama theme song in two years since 2018's \"Don't Leave Me\" for Fuji TV series Signal. Although slated to originally air on TV Tokyo in April, filming for the drama was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, and \"Stay Gold\"s release was delayed. Big Hit Entertainment officially announced in May the release date of BTS' then upcoming fourth full-length Japanese studio album as July 15. \"Stay Gold\" was included on the finalized track list as the lead single and would digitally precede the album's drop roughly one month in advance. The first audio teaser for the song was revealed on May 14 through a promotional music spot video for the album uploaded to Universal Music Japan's YouTube channel. The 15-second long clip included a brief audio snippet of \"Stay Gold\" at the end, in which BTS member Jungkook could be heard singing the words \"Stay gold\" with \"kimi sae ireba\" as the responding refrain. The clip garnered over 880,000 views within a week of its release. A second 15-second long music spot video was uploaded on July 12, featuring another excerpt of \"Stay Gold\", this time teasing the line: \"Stay gold, yume no naka demo\". \"Stay Gold\" was released worldwide across various digital music platforms on June 19. Yunika Vision ran a half-hour long special feature of seven BTS music videos including \"Stay Gold\" on its screens in front of Seibu-Shinjuku Station from July 6 to July 12; the feature was also accessible for mobile viewing with high-quality sound via the \"VISION \u03b1\" app. The complex later ran a Billboard Japan Hot 100 airplay feature of \"Stay Gold\" from July 28 to August 4; the music video was shown five times a day during that time. ==Music and lyrics== \"Stay Gold\" is a \"soothing, uplifting track\" that blends \"bouncy hip-hop beats on the verses and power-pop production on the choruses\". Teen Vogue called it a \"piano-pop number infused with enough cheer to make your cheeks burst...that picks up into a mid-tempo anthem of pure joy.\" APs Cristina Jaleru, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, described it as \"an uplifting piano tune with a catchy hook\". Musically, the song is composed in the key of C# Major at a tempo of 129 beats per minute with a runtime of 4:33, and features keyboard, guitar, and synthesizers in its instrumentation. It was produced by UTA, who also co-wrote it with Sunny Boy, Melanie Fontana, Michel Schulz, JUN, and KM-MARKIT. Jungkook and Yohei provided backing vocals, with UTA, Pdogg, Jee-yeon Kim, and Eun-jeong Park serving as recording engineers. Recording was split between Dogg Bounce and BigHit Studio in South Korea, and Studio Orat in Japan. Mixing was handled by D.O.I. at Daimonion Recordings, Shibuya, Tokyo. Lyrically, \"Stay Gold\" conveys the message that \"The world may not be full of good things, but please don't lose your luster\" and its opening line: \"In a world where you feel cold, you gotta stay gold, baby\" pays testimony to this. Vocalist Jungkook softly sings the song's first line, backed by isolated piano notes, before it changes pace and segues into rapper Suga's verse which is accompanied by \"bouncing strings\". The rappers of the group handle the verses while the choruses are shared amongst the vocalists. The song's lyrics are \"full of sentimentality\" and \"read like a love letter\" in parts, with rapper RM delivering lines that liken the eyes of the song's subject to \"diamonds\", calling them \"beautiful more than any other jewel.\" The chorus is filled with chants of \"stay gold\" from the band to their unnamed loved one interspersed between \"declarations of affection\", with Sound Digest calling it a \"great moment for fans to shout the words\". Vocalist Jimin sings his \"signature high note\" during the song's final chorus, backed by \"booming drums\" and \"soaring vocals\" from his fellow bandmates. Jimin and Jungkook share the final verse, trading lines as the song winds down to end on a softer note with a smooth harmonization. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Jeff Benjamin of Forbes labelled the song \"a comforting pop blanket with its scaling, surging hook encouraging listeners to \u201cstay gold\u201d\", and praised it for \"delivering empowering words at a time when many need it.\" Reviewing for Sound Digest, Amanda Thilo cited \"Stay Gold\" as \"most definitely a romantic song\" but also \"uplifting\", stating that \"during times like this it's nice to have a reminder to stay positive for ourselves and our loved ones\". Thilo also praised vocalist Jimin's \"signature high note\" for how it \"kicks the song into an even higher gear\", and complimented the harmonies between himself and fellow vocalist Jungkook, stating that their \"voices meld together seamlessly\". Thilo further remarked, \"With everything going on in the world, staying gold may just be what we need.\" Billboards Glenn Rowley also called the song \"romantic\", quoting the lyrics of the chorus in reference to this, and the video \"hopeful\" and \"sunny\". E! Online's Samantha Schnurr described the video as \"an uplifting visual featuring plenty of sunshine and an apropos representation of the track title.\" Noting possible inspiration from ongoing world events, India's Mumbai Mirror wrote, \"As the COVID-19 pandemic takes grip of the globe, many are forced to stay indoors, separated from their loved ones. But just like the track's encouraging message, the seven artistes see the light at the end of the tunnel. As the lyrics go \"If you want a miracle // I'll show you one\", the seven walk out into spring, a stark contrast from where they were initially put.\" Consequence of Sound called it \"beautifully uplifting\", stating, \"While it might be easy to feel overwhelmed given the current state of affairs, BTS are adamant about remaining hopeful...that's the advice they pass along to their fans in \"Stay Gold\".\" Echoing similar sentiments, ET Canada felt the video \"brightens up the world, bringing light and colour to the darkness...when they [BTS] hit the chorus, things suddenly get bright and summery.\" Also writing for Billboard post-album release, Gil Kaufman stated, \"BTS know all about summer lovin'. And with...\"Stay Gold\", they're having a blast.\" He described the song as \"another ear-worm classic\" and said \"BTS will melt your hearts\". ===Commercial performance=== In Japan, \"Stay Gold\" entered the Billboard Japan Hot 100 at number 18.

The video opens to show Jungkook in a dark room, as he gazes beyond the dilapidated spot. In the following scenes, the rest of the members are also shown wandering in various dark and decrepit locations, separated from one another. In it, they collectively dream about reuniting with each other on a sunshine-filled day and enjoy little things together. During each chorus, the video switches to lighter settings, showing the members playing Jenga, reading a book, or petting a dog. They enjoy the warm atmosphere while basking in gold light and confetti. Eventually, they see rays of light in the dark surroundings which help them to escape and reunite with each other. As the video draws to a close, they successfully seek paradise together, discovering a brighter world filled with purple flowers and lush nature. The video was directed by Yoo-jung Ko of LUMPENS.
