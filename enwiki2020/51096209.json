Prasad had earlier written and directed the music video for Sofia Ashraf's \"Kodaikanal Won't\" song. Prasad's wife, Basak Gaziler Prasad, a Turkish film producer, decided to produce the film. The film was revealed to be a contemporary take on Baital Pachisi (a collection of folk tales featuring Vetala and Vikramaditya), with Ashwin portraying a video game designer who becomes rich overnight. The film began production on Madhya Pradesh during July 2016, with Aishwarya Rajesh soon joining the film as the lead actress. The profile of the film was raised in June 2017, when Bollywood actor Abhay Deol joined the film as a co-producer and actor. Being a friend of Prasad, Deol joined the project after being impressed with the script and agreed to play the role of a medieval king named Vikramadithyan. For his role in the film, Deol lost ten kilograms and learnt to speak his lines in ancient Tamil, as the makers chose a sync sound technique. In 2018, the team worked on the post-production of the film and began their promotional campaign for its release. == References == Category:Indian films Category:Upcoming films Category:Indian fantasy films Category:Films scored by Mohamaad Ghibran Category:Upcoming Tamil-language films Category:Upcoming directorial debut films Category:Unreleased Tamil-language films ",
