The plot features the story of Helo\u00edsa and Pedro who after years of separation meet once again and realize the feelings they had for each other, and the efforts of Ti\u00e3o and Magn\u00f3lia to separate them. It also features politics, power, seduction, comedy, envy, and family drama in the fictitious town of S\u00e3o Dimas where the characters' lives intertwine to create cohesion and conflicts. == Plot == The story begins in 1995 in a fictitious city of S\u00e3o Dimas, a metropolitan region of S\u00e3o Paulo, which is a typical picture of society and politics. A medium-sized town, that has its main source of income from a weaving factory headed by businessman Fausto (Tarc\u00edsio Meira) and his wife Magn\u00f3lia (Vera Holtz), known to many simply as M\u00e1g, whom the city's population has real veneration. What most people don't know is that M\u00e1g, behind the veneer of false tenderness which all tend to view, hides her true nature; she is arrogant, authoritarian, always thirsty for power and without any scruples. By using various tricks to get what she wants no matter who gets hurt and trying to use these as justification that everything she does is to keep his family together. Fausto married M\u00e1g shortly after her first wife's death, who was Pedro's (Chay Suede/Reynaldo Gianecchini) mother. They have to other children H\u00e9rcules and Vit\u00f3ria. Pedro meets Helo\u00edsa, a young woman who lives a quiet life with her parents; her mother C\u00e2ndida, who has leukemia, and the unemployed and alcoholic father Jorge. In an act of desperation, her father tries to rob the textile company owned by Fausto but ends up being indicted and arrested; in prison, there is a rebellion and the latter dies. Later, his mother also passes on from her disease for lack of proper treatment. With Hel\u00f4 and Pedro's relationship, which started prior to the unfortunate events, M\u00e1g and Fausto cultivate a plan to separate the two. They hire Gabriela, a new secretary of M\u00e1g to seduce and lure Pedro to bed and they also contract Hel\u00f4 to a modeling agency run by M\u00e1g's trusted friend and confidante Gigi. In cahoots with M\u00e1g, Gigi sends Hel\u00f4 away from S\u00e3o Dimas for a modeling leaving Pedro vulnerable to Suzana. At the same time they cut communication between the two and Pedro felt that Hel\u00f4 had moved on without him. On the night of Hel\u00f4 surprise return, Pedro got drunk and fell a sleep. M\u00e1g demands Suzana to seduce Pedro. Hel\u00f4 finds the naked Suzana with Pedro and believes that Pedro betrayed (even though nothing really happened between the two and Pedro never knew about it till years later). During the anger episode Hel\u00f4 leaves S\u00e3o Dimas indefinitely to be a professional model where she meets Ti\u00e3o, a man that she marries and Pedro lives for France due to the pain he felt by Hel\u00f4's absence. Years later, Hel\u00f4 has seemingly moved on with her powerful Ti\u00e3o (Jos\u00e9 Mayer) who are apparently become distant over the years, with their two children; Let\u00edcia who suffers the same ailment the grandmother had and Edu who has a difficult relationship with his father. Pedro returns to S\u00e3o Dimas and their romance with Hel\u00f4 is rekindled, once more putting each other to the test as the forces that are set to separate them are more reinforced. == Cast == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Actor/actress !Character |- |Cl\u00e1udia Abreu |Helo\u00edsa Martins Bezerra (Hel\u00f4) |- |Reynaldo Gianecchini |Pedro Guedes Leit\u00e3o |- |Vera Holtz |Magn\u00f3lia Costa Leit\u00e3o |- |Jos\u00e9 Mayer |Sebasti\u00e3o Bezerra (Ti\u00e3o) |- |Grazi Massafera |Luciane Leit\u00e3o |- |Tarc\u00edsio Meira |Fausto Leit\u00e3o |- |Isabella Santoni |Let\u00edcia Martins Bezerra |- |Camila Morgado |Vit\u00f3ria Costa Leit\u00e3o Noronha |- |Ricardo Tozzi |Augusto Tavares |- |Thiago Lacerda |Ciro Noronha |- |Danilo Grangheia |H\u00e9rcules Costa Leit\u00e3o |- |Claudia Raia |Salete |- |Daniel Rocha |Gustavo |- |Humberto Carr\u00e3o |Tiago Leit\u00e3o |- |Matheus Fagundes |Eduardo Martins Bezerra (\"Edu\") |- |Alice Wegmann |Isabela Dias |- |Bruna Ham\u00fa |Camila Leit\u00e3o |- |Emanuelle Ara\u00fajo |Yara Garcia |- |Tuca Andrada |Misael de Oliveira |- |Arianne Botelho |Aline Garcia de Oliveira |- |Ot\u00e1vio Augusto |C\u00e9sar Venturini |- |Maur\u00edcio Machado |Arlindo Nacib |- |Gil Coelho |Wesley |- |Bianca M\u00fcller |Ana Luiza Costa Leit\u00e3o |- |Ana Rosa |Zuleika Pessoa (Zuza) |- |Maria Flor |Fl\u00e1via |- |Regiane Alves |Beth Tavares |- |Danilo Ferreira |Zelito |- |Helo\u00edsa P\u00e9riss\u00e9 |Mileide Rocha |- |Titina Medeiros |Ruty Raquel Rocha |- |Armando Babaioff |Bruno Pessoa |- |Gabriel Chadan |Robinson |- |\u00c9rico Br\u00e1s |Jader Azevedo |- |Pierre Baitelli |Ant\u00f4nio Ferrari |- |Jo\u00e3o Campos |\u00c9lio Bataglia |- |Tato Gabus Mendes |Olavo Maciel |- |Marcella Rica |J\u00e9ssica |- |Bia Montez |Leila de Oliveira |} === Special participations === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Actor/actress !Character |- |Regina Duarte |Suzana Rivera |- |Isabelle Drummond |Helo\u00edsa Martins (Hel\u00f4) (first phase) |- |Chay Suede |Pedro Guedes Leit\u00e3o (first phase) |- |Sophia Abrah\u00e3o |Vit\u00f3ria Costa Leit\u00e3o (first phase) |- |Gabriela Duarte |Suzana Rivera (first phase) |- |Thiago Martins | Sebasti\u00e3o Bezerra (\"Ti\u00e3o\") (first phase) |- |Hugo Bonemer |Augusto Tavares (first phase) |- |Maur\u00edcio Destri |Ciro Noronha (first phase) |- |Bianca Salgueiro |Carmen da Silva Leit\u00e3o (first phase) |- |Jo\u00e3o V\u00edtor Silva |H\u00e9rcules Costa Leit\u00e3o (first phase) |- |Denise Fraga |C\u00e2ndida Martins |- |Daniel Ribeiro |Jorge Martins |- |Bruna Moleiro |Yara Garcia (first phase) |- |Acau\u00e3 Sol |Misael de Oliveira (first phase) |- |Theo Medon |\u00c9lio Bataglia (first phase) |- |Ana Carolina Godoy |Magn\u00f3lia (young) |- |} ==Soundtrack== === Volume 1 === *Cover: Cl\u00e1udia Abreu, Reynaldo Gianecchini, Chay Suede and Isabelle Drummond === Volume 2 === *Cover: Alice Wegmann and Humberto Carr\u00e3o == Ratings == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:20%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Timeslot ! style=\"width:7%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| # Eps. ! colspan=2| Premiere ! colspan=2| Finale ! style=\"width:5%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Rank ! style=\"width:7%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season ! style=\"width:10%; background:#ffdead;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Average viewership |- !
