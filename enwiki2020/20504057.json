Svend Bayer (born 2 January 1946 in Uganda to Danish parents) is a studio potter described by Michael Cardew as \"easily my best pupil.\" Bayer studied at University of Exeter from 1965 to 1968 and began work at Wenford Bridge Pottery with Michael Cardew in 1969. In 1972 he joined the Brannam Pottery in Barnstaple, where he worked as a thrower for a year. He has been described as probably the best of the potters to work at Wenford Bridge, and his large pots have been said to be \"very powerful\".Rice, P., British Studio Ceramics, Barrie and Jenkins, London, 1989, p.55 After travelling in the Far East, Asia and the United States, he set up his own workshop in Sheepwash Beaworthy, Devon in 1975. He uses local North Devon ball clays and fires his kiln with wood. He is known for boldly decorated domestic ware and very large garden pots.Watson Oliver, Studio Pottery Phaidon 1993, p.152 Bayer has exhibited widely in Europe, the Middle East, North America, Australia and New Zealand.www.studio-pots.com == References == Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Exeter Category:English potters ",
