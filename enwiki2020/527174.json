In 1945, she served in the Far East with the British Pacific Fleet, designated Task Force 57 upon joining the United States fleet. On 6 May 1945 Wave King and Wave Monarch were with the Logistic Support Group 300 miles south-east of Miyako to refuel Task Force 57 which was launching air strikes against island targets in the Okinawa campaign. Wave King struck a rock north of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds de Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil, on 9 August 1956 and suffered severe damage. She was withdrawn from service as a result and was laid up at Portsmouth later in 1956. She arrived at Barrow-in- Furness on 16 April 1960 for scrapping. ==References== Category:Wave-class oilers Category:Tankers of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:1944 ships Category:Ministry of War Transport ships Category:Ships built in Govan Category:Ships built by Harland and Wolff Category:Maritime incidents in 1956 ",
