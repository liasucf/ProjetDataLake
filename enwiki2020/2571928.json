    "text": "\"Shoes\" is a song performed by Canadian country pop singer Shania Twain. It was the first single released from the Desperate Housewives soundtrack in 2005. The song was written by Twain and then-husband, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and co-written by Tammy Hyler, Joie Scott and Kim Tribble. It is the last studio recording issued by Twain prior to the dissolution of her marriage to Lange, and the last Twain recording to feature any involvement from Lange. The song was originally written and recorded for use on the ABC television program Desperate Housewives. ==Song information== The music video for \"Shoes\" was to feature the four main actresses of Desperate Housewives alongside Twain, and debut before the second season premiere, however the video was canceled. The song did fairly well on the charts considering there was no promotion by the label or Twain, it reached number 29 at country radio. The single was later released for airplay in Australia and Europe, with a new pop mix. A few adult contemporary stations in Canada played the remix of \"Shoes\" produced by Joe Bermudez. According to his website, the producers of the show wanted something more \"hip\" to play for the show, and that's why a third version of the song was made.http://www.joebermudez.com/ Joe Bermudez website In 2006 it was announced \"Shoes\" would be released commercially in the UK, but the release was never shipped from EMI to retailers, and was finally canceled.
