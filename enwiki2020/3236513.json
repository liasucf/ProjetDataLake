The neighborhood lies between Flatlands and Mill Basin to the east, and Gerritsen Beach, Midwood, and Sheepshead Bay to the south and west. It is mostly squared off in area by Gerritsen Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Avenue U and Kings Highway. The neighborhood's eponymous park is the largest public park in Brooklyn.Marine Park, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed September 24, 2016. \"As Brooklyn's largest park, Marine Park has plenty of room to serve a lot of needs. Environmentally, it consists of 530 acres of grassland and precious salt marsh, protected as a Forever Wild preserve.\" Charles Downing Lay won a silver medal in town planning at the 1936 Olympics for the planning of Marine Park. Marine Park is largely inhabited by ethnic groups such as Italians, Irish, Greeks, and Jews. The area is part of Brooklyn Community Board 18. ==History== The neighborhood is situated around Gerritsen Creek, the westernmost inlet of Jamaica Bay; the creek's path within the neighborhood was covered in 1920. During the last 5,000 years, strips of sand were deposited by ocean currents. These beach strips form a surf-barrier and allow salt marshes to thrive: The area was a hunting and fishing ground for Native Americans from the nearby village of Keshawchqueren. Pits for cooking and preparing food dating from 800 to 1400 AD were uncovered in Marine Park, along with deer and turtle bones, oyster shells, and sturgeon scales. In the 17th century, the Dutch began to settle in the area, which had similarities to the marshland and coastal plains of the Netherlands. The land proved to be fairly good farmland and there was an abundance of clams, oysters, and game from the region as well. One of the oldest houses in the neighborhood is the Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City designated landmark. See also: In the 18th century, George Washington made a stop for several days on the land nearby. There was a gristmill on the water at the time. As early as 1910, developers began dredging ports within Jamaica Bay in an effort to develop a seaport district there. Although the city allowed several piers to be constructed in 1918, only one was built on the former Barren Island. The pier, which was built in order to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast and was wide. In 1931, the city took possession of on the western side of Barren Island. That plot was combined with a tract owned by Kings County to create the park named Marine Park. Urban planner Robert Moses expanded Marine Park in 1935, and the city acquired of land. This comprised the entire island west of Flatbush Avenue. Barren Island's residents were mostly evicted by 1939, and part of the island became part of Marine Park, but much of the rest of the island became Floyd Bennett Field. In 1935, the mill burned down to the water level due to vandals, leaving only wood pilings across the water, which can be clearly seen to this day during low tide. In the mid-20th century the area was abused by trash and abandoned cars. At one point it became a landfill and trash piled up to in certain areas. After a massive cleanup effort in the 1990s the area was restored to its former glory, with exception of a few rusty car parts riddling the area, and teens littering and causing arson to the dry tall Phragmites from time to time. ==Demographics== Marine Park is located in zip code 11234, which also includes Mill Basin, Bergen Beach/Georgetown, and the southern portion of Flatlands.
