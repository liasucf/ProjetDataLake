It is located about west of the city centre, surrounded by the neighbourhoods of Liboc (N), B\u0159evnov (E), B\u00edl\u00e1 Hora (SW) and Ruzyn\u011b (W). The first mention of the forest, originally called Malejov, dates from 993, when duke Boleslaus II donated it to the newly established B\u0159evnov Monastery. It was transformed into a walled game reserve during rule of Ferdinand I in the mid-16th century. The current name (hv\u011bzda being Czech for \"star\") derives from the Star Summer Palace, a 16th-century building, which stands in middle of the forest. The Battle of White Mountain took place on fields in the W/SW vicinity of the game reserve in 1620. Nowadays part of the site is designated as a Natura 2000 protected site due to the presence of the narrow-mouthed whorl snail (Vertigo angustior). The site is home to several bird species including the Middle Spotted Woodpecker. ==External links== * Obora Hv\u011bzda (The Hv\u011bzda Game Preserve) Natural Monument * Prague's Green Spaces: Quick guide to visiting Obora Hv\u011bzda * Czech Society for Ornithology: Birding in Prague Category:Special Areas of Conservation Category:Natural monuments in the Czech Republic Category:Forests of the Czech Republic Category:Parks in Prague ",
