The playoffs were scheduled to begin in December 2016, with the first legs of the semifinals being held on 11 December 2016 and the second legs on 14 December 2016. The final and consolation matches were scheduled for 18 December 2016, but were not played. This was due to a double forfeit between Mount Rich and Paradise FC International as both their games were unplayed. By default, Hard Rock won the league title after beating St. John's Sports 4\u20130 on aggregate in their semifinal series. St. John's was the default runner-up. Both St. John's and Hard Rock earned berths into the 2017 CFU Club Championship, but ended up not participating in the competition. ==Teams== A total of 10 teams are taking part in the league. New Hampshire United and GBSS were relegated to the GFA First Division. The two clubs that replaced them were Mount Rich and Gouyave. Mount Rich is returned to the top flight for the first time since 2014, while Gouyave was making their inaugural campaign in the top division. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Club ! Location !
