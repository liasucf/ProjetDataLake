The last version of the manor house was Silverton Park (also called Egremont House), a large neoclassical mansion house built in 1839\u201345 by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786-1845) and demolished in 1901. It was according to Pevsner and Cherry (1991) \"an extraordinary design, entirely clothed in colonnades\",Pevsner, 1991 edition, p.744 but was \"a monstrous Italian house\" in the opinion of Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge (1851-1927). It comprised as its core the former early Georgian manor house of Combe Satchfield. ==Combe Satchfield== Combsatchfield House, pre-1905 photograph of a pre-1839 painting, published in The Story of a Devonshire House (1905) by Bernard Coleridge, 2nd Baron Coleridge, whose grandfather as a child was a frequent visitor there to his \"Aunt Brown\" The house was built on the site of the early Georgian manor house of Combe Satchfield, anciently Culme Sachville,Culm Sachvill per Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John- William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.194; Culme sachvile per Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.80 which formed the core of the new building. ===Domesday Book=== The manor called by Pole (d.1635) Culm Sachvill and Culm Reigny was said by him to have been \"neere the river of Culme\",Pole, p.194 from which the nearby town of Collumpton is named, \"the chiefest place on her stream that beareth her name\" (Risdon).Risdon, p.86 In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as COLVN (i.e. \"Colun\"),Per Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.)

There had however been various changes in the manors held by this select group of Saxon thanes after the Norman Conquest as of the eleven manors Godwin held under the Norman king in 1086, he had held only three in 1066 under King Edward the Confessor, namely Chittlehampton, Holbrook and Down Umfraville. The extra eight manors he held in 1086, including COLVN, had all previously been held by the Saxon Alstan, who held nothing in 1086.Per Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.)

Other Devon manors held at some time by the de Reigny family included Eggesford.See Battle Abbey Roll Rigny =====de Humfraville===== Culm Rengy was later held by John de Humfravill,Thorn, part 2, 52:17 whose Anglo-Norman family (alias de Umfraville, etc.) was tenant of several other manors from the Honour of Gloucester, including Down UmfravilleThorn, part 2, 52:19 in the hundred of Axmouth, which had been held by Godwin the thane both before and after the Norman Conquest. Sir Gilbert Umfraville of Penmark was one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, the legendary followers of Robert FitzHamon (d.1107), the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan and first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester. Culme does not appear to have taken for suffix the name of this family.See Battle Abbey Roll Vmframuile =====de Sachville===== In the Book of Fees Colm Reyngny was recorded as held from the Honour of Gloucester by Robert de Sicca Villa (literally \"from the dry town\", the Latinized form of the Norman-French de Sacheville). Thereafter the manor was known as Culme Sachville, later corrupted and Anglicised to Sackville, Sachfield, etc. The name of Culme even later became corrupted to Combe, a common form in Devon, such as Combe Martin, Branscombe, etc., which were however named from their locations in the steep sided valleys of Devonshire called in the local vernacular \"combes\". The landscape at Combe Satchfield is however comparatively flat and a steep-sided valley does not exist in the immediate vicinity. It was variously recorded as held by Robert and Phillip Sachville. Other manors held at some time by the Sachville family or branches thereof included Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe and Bicton. Their chief manor in Devonshire was Clist Sachville.See Battle Abbey Roll Sageuile =====Others===== An heiress named Margaret, possibly of the Sachville family, brought it by marriage to her husband Sir Simon Meriet. It was later inherited by the Courtenay family of Powderham, apparently having been exchanged for other lands with the Bonville family of Shute, (the great rivals of their cousins the Courtenay Earls of Devon of Tiverton Castle) who sold it to Henry Skibbow, whose son was resident there in about 1630. The Courtenays sold part of the estate to the father of Mr Laund of Woodbeare, who held it in about 1630. The other part the Courtenays sold to Edward Drewe of Sharpham, Serjeant-at-Law, whose son Sir Thomas Drewe (d.1651) of The Grange of Dunkeswell Abbey,Pevsner, p.217 Broadhembury, Sheriff of Devon in 1612, sold it (together with Killerton, to which it adjoins, the later Acland seat) to Sir Arthur Acland (d.1610)Pole, p.194; Vivian, pp.306-7, pedigree of Drewe of Acland. In 1654 it was the property of Gilbert Mortimer, of the Mortimer family of Poundesland and Stockwell House.Parnell, Graham J.H.

Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter The overlordship of the feudal barony of Gloucester can be assumed to have disappeared following the abolition of feudal land tenure in England by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. In 1720 the estate was purchased by the judge Sir Henry Langford, 3rd Baronet (c.1656\u20131725), of Gray's Inn, Sheriff of Devon in 1716, who also owned estates at Bradninch and who in 1710 had purchased the manor of Kingskerswell where his successor Henry II Langford Brown (1802-1857) built Barton Hall. He was from a prominent Irish family, the second son of Sir Hercules Langford, 1st Baronet (c.1625-1683), of Kilmackedrett, County Antrim, by his wife Mary Upton, a daughter of Henry Upton of Castle Upton, County Antrim. The arms of Langford of Kilmackedrett were: Paly of six sable and or, on a chief vert a lion passant guardant of the secondBurke's General Armory, 1884, p.582 which were visible on the facade of the now demolished Antrim Castle.This photograph of Antrim Castle in 1932 shows in great detail the Jacobean cut-stone armorial bearings.

Below these are two shields, one shows the coat of arms of Sir Hugh Clotworthy and the other coat of arms is of his wife - Mary Langford, and the date is between them. On the dextor, 'Castrum hoc cond'; and in the centre, 'Decimo maii'; and under the initials 'H. C,' and M. C.' on the sinister we have 'Anno domino 1613'.

Below this is the inscription, 'Reno c. comes Massereene, MDCCIII', this was put there on instructions from Chichester, 4th Earl of Massereene. Next we have the arms of Clotworthy, 4th Viscount Massereene, with the arms of Chichester impaled. Then on down on the circular slab is the following: 'HOC CASTELLUM AUSPICE JOANNE CLOTWORTHY UNDECIMO VICE COMITE MASSEREENE REFECTUM ET AMPLIFICATUM EST A.D. MDCCCLXXXIX' These arms are almost identical to those of the Langford gentry family of Bratton Clovelly in Devon, of whom the earliest recorded head was Richard Langsford (died 1583).Vivian, p.521, pedigree of Langford of Bratton Clovelly, arms: Paly of six argent and gules, on a chief of the first a lion passant sable Sir Henry Langford's portrait, now in the collection of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, was painted in 1710 by William Gandy (1650-1729). He died in 1725 without male issue, when the baronetcy became extinct. He bequeathed all his Devonshire estates to his godson, Thomas Brown.http://www.rammuseum.org.uk/collections/fine-art/a-gallery-in-the- gardens/sir-henry-langford... The Irish estates appear to have gone to the descendants of his sister Mary Langford, the wife of Sir John Rowley. Mary Langford's grandson was Hercules Langford Rowley, husband of Elizabeth Upton, who was created Viscountess Langford in 1766. Hercules Rowley's daughter, Hon Jane Rowley, married Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective. Lord Bective's fourth son was created Baron Langford in 1800. ===Langford-Brown=== ====Thomas Brown==== In compliance with the terms of his inheritance Thomas Brown assumed the surname Langford-Brown. His sonPossibly grandson and heir was Henry I Langford-Brown (1721-1800). ====Henry I Langford-Brown (1721-1800)==== 1756 portrait of Henry I Langford Brown (1721-1800), of Comb Satchfield and Kingskerswell, Devon.

By Frances he had eleven children, two of whom died as infants.Per inscription of her mural monument in Silverton Church *Secondly to Dorothy Ayre Taylor (died 1831), (whose portrait was painted by John Keenan ), by whom he had no further progeny. She was one of the two daughters of Bernard Frederick Taylor, of Islington, Middlesex, a merchant of the City of London, by his wife Frances Duke, one of five sisters and co-heiresses of Robert Duke (d.1741), lord of the manor of Otterton in Devon.Coleridge, Bernard, 2nd Baron Coleridge, The Story of a Devonshire House, T.

In 1779 he was promoted lieutenant in Simcoe's Rangers alias the Queen's American Rangers, which served in the American War of Independence. At the height of anti-American Republicanism in England, in 1793 he was one of the soldiers policing a march and demonstration in Topsham, Devon, by the loyalist citizens of Devon, supported by the local gentry. An effigy of Thomas Paine was hung on a gibbet and his \"execrable book\" The Rights of Man was ceremoniously burnt. By W. T. Sherwin, W.T. & Carlile, Richard, The Republican, Volume 9, London, 1824, pp.98-100 (a British newspaper established as Sherwin's Political Register by Richard Carlile in 1817 and renamed in 1819) His chest tomb survives in Silverton churchyard, next to the west door of the church, inscribed as follows: Underneath are deposited the mortal remains of Thomas Langford Brown Esqr. (of Comb Satchfield in this parish) who died January 27th 1833 aged 71 years. Following the death in 1831 of Dorothy Ayre Taylor (Mrs Brown), the widow of Henry Langford Brown, he succeeded to the reversion under the will of his father or uncle. Combe Satchfield was sold, apparently in 1831, to George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786-1845), of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset, lord of the manor of Silverton. Thomas I Langford Brown had at least three sons: Portrait of Henry II Langford Brown (1802-1857), by Richard Augustus Clack (1804\u20131881), Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, donated in 1957 by Thomas Hercules Langford Brown *Henry II Langford Brown (1802-1857), eldest son and heir, who abandoned Combe Satchfield and moved to his other manor of Kingskerswell where at a cost of \u00a310,000 he built in the 1830s a neo-Tudor country house called Barton Hall, near Torquay, which was more conveniently located for his interest in Yachting. On arrival back in the harbour of Torquay he is said to have been in the habit of firing a cannon to summon his coach to collect him. Barton Hall burned down in 1862 but was immediately rebuilt, during which time the family lived at nearby Fluder House.The History of Barton Hall, KEYBOARDCHAT.COM The Internet Magazine for Organ-Keyboard Enthusiasts Barton Hall estate was inherited in 1936 by Thomas Hercules Langford Brown and was requisitioned during World War II by the Fire Service and then by the Civil Defence. It was returned to Brown in a dilapidated state, whereupon it was sold to a group of Torquay Businessmen, including a Mr Liddell, who turned it into a holiday centre. It was acquired in 1957 by Fred Pontin who made it the flagship of his Pontins holiday camp empire, and later was acquired by the \"3D Education & Adventure\" group. In 1957 Thomas Hercules Langford Brown donated two family portraits of Henry I Langford Brown and Henry II Langford Brown to the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. *Thomas II Langfield Brown (1804-1849), buried in the chest tomb of Thomas I Langford Brown, Silverton churchyardChest tomb inscribed on north side: Here also are deposited the remains of Thomas Langford Brown who died June 3rd 1849 aged 45 and of Edwin Langford Brown who died June 8th 1849 aged 39 *Edwin Langford Brown (1810-1849), buried in the chest tomb of Thomas I Langford Brown, Silverton churchyard ==Manor of Silverton== During the reign of Henry IV (1399-1413) the manor of Silverton was purchased by the Justice of the Common Pleas Sir John Wadham of Edge in Branscombe, Devon ancestor of John Wadham (d.1578) of Merryfield in Ilton, Somerset, the father of Florence Wadham wife of Sir John Wyndham (d.1572) of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset and sister of Nicholas Wadham (1531/1532\u20131609), founder of Wadham College, Oxford. It was bought partly from Sir John Meriet and partly from Phillipa, widow of Matthew Courtenay. From the Wadham family it was eventually inherited by Sir John Wyndham (1558\u20131645), of Orchard Wyndham, ancestor of the Earls of Egremont. ==Construction== Pre-1901 photograph of Silverton Park, south front viewed from the south-east. The holly tree survives today on the site now overgrown with mature trees Having inherited the Egremont earldom but not the great Egremont seat of Petworth House in Sussex, the 4th Earl determined to rival Petworth with a house of his own. His architect was James Thomas Knowles who provided him with 187 rooms, occupying one acre of ground. and was constructed in brick with a render of patented metallic cement. A frieze depicting the Exodus of the Israelites into Egypt was sculpted on the cornice. When the earl died in 1845 without progeny, the interior of the house was incomplete and was never subsequently finished. His eventual heir to Silverton and to the more ancient Wyndham estate of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, was his distant cousin William VI Wyndham (1834-1914) of Dinton House in Wiltshire. ==Demolition== The house's contents were sold in 1892 and it was demolished in 1901.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.744 The demolition was described as follows by the Devon Weekly Times newspaper, 15 November 1901, under the headline \"DEVON MANSION BLOWN UP\": > \"Egremont House situated about half a mile from Silverton, stands on an acre > of ground. It has 150 rooms and has been unoccupied for more than 40 years. > It was built 60 years ago by Lord Egremont, who only occupied it for about > four years, when he died without seeing the completion of the massive > undertaking. The place has been the scene of a great deal of interest for > some months past. To complete the structure a fortune would have to be > spent, and as a result it has fallen into the hands of Messrs.

Some of the dynamite charges had not > exploded and others had misspent. Interest in the event waned and excitement > died down at this palpable failure. But the telling trial was yet to be > consummated. After a sufficient wait, the workmen cautiously crept back to > the building, recharged the orifices with dynamite and again ignited the > fuses, retiring as before to a safe distance. Presently the crack of > artillery was heard, smoke issued in puffs from different parts of the > mansion and presently one pillar after another fell to the ground with a > resounding crash, and from the debris ascended clouds of dust which could > have been seen for miles around.

Messrs, Taylor and Atkins will probably bring > their smashing operations to a final close a few days later.\" ==Surviving stable block== Surviving stable block, situated about 200 yards west of demolished mansion house The surviving stable block, is according to Pevsner and Cherry (1991) a \"monumental pedimented composition around a courtyard\" built \"in a severely Grecian style\" (Pevsner, 1952).Pevsner, The Buildings of England: South Devon, Harmondsworth, 1952, p.263 It is the only surviving remnant of the house and was acquired in 1987 by Sir John Smith, founder of the Landmark Trust who sought to prevent it being converted into flats. In 2004, with the financial assistance of a private donor, the Landmark Trust started its restoration for use as self-catering holiday accommodation, completed in 2008.Landmark Trust: Silverton Park Stables ==Nefarious use of sale catalogue== The art forger Shaun Greenhalgh and his father acquired a copy of the 1892 sale catalogue and used the un-illustrated catalogue descriptions to recreate items, for which the catalogue was used to provide spurious provenances.
