The Australian Union of Students (AUS) was formed in December 1970 as the successor to the National Union of Australian University Students (NUAUS) as a representative body and lobby group for Australian University and College of Advanced Education students. It collapsed in 1984 and was succeeded by the National Union of Students in 1987. The NUAUS had been formed in 1937 as a representative body for Australian university students, and changed its name to reflect the addition of colleges of advanced education to the tertiary education system in Australia.

Almost one year after the end of Gillard's term, in late 1984 a special National Conference of AUS, chaired by the union's Western Australian State Organiser, wound up the union. The reason for its dissolution was its lack of access to funding from previously affiliated University campuses, which disaffiliated in 1983 as a result of a series of student referendums held at campuses around Australia. The Union and NUAUS organized four alternative festivals 1967\u20131973, Australian Universities Arts Festival and Aquarius Festival, the latter being a starting point for a new development era of Byron Bay area. ==References== Category:Students' unions in Australia ",
