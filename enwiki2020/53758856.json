Many of her songs have been licensed for multiple television shows including Grey's Anatomy, 90210, Ringer and Lost Girl. == Early life == Early in her career, Adaline had a moment of international recognition in 2009 when she met Robert Pattinson at a Juno party and tweeted about their encounter. An unnamed source found her tweet and linked to it, saying Rob Pattinson was sighted with Canadian musician Adaline and posted a link to her website. In less than 24 hours, Twilight fans from all over the world were reposting her on social media and thousands of people downloaded her music. ==Career== Adaline's sophomore release Modern Romantics was nominated for \"Pop Recording of the Year\" at the 2012 Western Canadian Music Awards. Adaline's music video for the first single of her sophomore album The Noise premiered on Interview Magazine, receiving over 100,000 views in its first week online and was charted in the Top 20. In 2013, Adaline was invited to do a 10-month composer residency at Norman Jewison's Canadian Film Centre. She has collaborated with many artists on their own projects including Buck 65, Fake Shark Real Zombie, and Adult Karate. In 2015, Adaline covered Genesis' song \"Follow You Follow Me\", which is featured in the very successful Cineplex animated short film Lily and the Snowman. A spin off of the film made headlines in the UK when a young student fooled the internet into thinking his holiday film was a real John Lewis holiday ad. Adaline's cover is used in the student film. Adaline contributed to the score of the Bret Easton Ellis written film The Canyons, starring Lindsay Lohan. She co-wrote three songs on the soundtrack with Brendan Canning of Broken Social Scene. Adaline's song \"Keep Me High\" is featured in both the film and trailer for Below Her Mouth, starring Erika Linder, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2016 and came out in theatres in the US in April 2017. Adaline's song \"Ghost\" is also featured in a groundbreaking scene in the episode \"Friends In Low Places\" of the popular Syfy show Wynonna Earp. The episode received an uproar of extremely positive reactions on social media, as the scene \"Ghost\" is featured in had one of the most accurately represented and heartwarming love-making scenes in LGBTQ+ history. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Canadian female singer-songwriters Category:Canadian pop singers Category:Musicians from Ottawa Category:Writers from Ottawa Category:Living people Category:1988 births ",
