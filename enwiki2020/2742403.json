    "text": "The Mathematical Association is a professional society concerned with mathematics education in the UK. ==History== It was founded in 1871 as the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching and renamed to the Mathematical Association in 1894. It was the first teachers' subject organisation formed in England. In March 1927, it held a three-day meeting in Grantham to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of Sir Isaac Newton, attended by Sir J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron), Sir Frank Watson Dyson \u2013 the Astronomer Royal, Sir Horace Lamb, and G. H. Hardy. In the 1960s, when comprehensive education was being introduced, the Association was in favour of the 11-plus system. For maths teachers training at university, a teaching award that was examined was the Diploma of the Mathematical Association, later known as the Diploma in Mathematical Education of the Mathematical Association. ==Function== It exists to \"bring about improvements in the teaching of mathematics and its applications, and to provide a means of communication among students and teachers of mathematics\".The Mathematical Association \u2014 supporting mathematics in education Since 1894 it has published The Mathematical Gazette. It is one of the participating bodies in the quadrennial British Congress of Mathematics Education, organised by the Joint Mathematical Council, and it holds its annual general meeting as part of the Congress.BMCE Handbook, accessed 2018-10-09 ==Structure== It is based in the south-east of Leicester on London Road (A6), just south of the Charles Frears campus of De Montfort University. Aside from the Council, it has seven other specialist committees. ===Regions=== Its branches are sometimes shared with the ATM: * Birmingham * Cambridge * East Midlands * Glasgow * Gloucester * Liverpool * London * Marches * Meridian (southern England) * Sheffield * Sussex * Yorkshire ==Past presidents== Past presidents of The Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching included: *1871 Thomas Archer Hirst *1878 R B Hayward MA, FRS *1889 Professor G M Minchin MA, FRS *1891 James Joseph Sylvester *1892 The Reverend C Taylor DD *1893 R Wormell MA, DSc *1895 Joseph Larmor Past presidents of The Mathematical Association have included: *1897 Alfred Lodge *1899\u20131900 Robert Stawell Ball *1901 John Fletcher Moulton, Baron Moulton *1903 Andrew Forsyth *1905 George Ballard Mathews *1907 George H.
