Graner Jr. (born 1968) is a war criminal and former member of the U.S. Army reserve who was convicted of prisoner abuse in connection with the 2003\u20132004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. Graner, with other soldiers from his unit, the 372nd Military Police Company, were accused of allowing and inflicting sexual, physical, and psychological abuse on Iraqi prisoners of war in Abu Ghraib prison, a notorious prison in Baghdad during the United States' occupation of Iraq. Graner was convicted of conspiracy to maltreat detainees, failing to protect detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, as well as charges of assault, indecency, and dereliction of duty. He was found guilty of all charges on January 14, 2005, and sentenced to 10 years in prison, demotion to private, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay and allowances. Charges of adultery and obstruction of justice were dropped before trial.Abu Ghraib Court Martial: \"Ring Leader\" Spc. Charles A. Graner Jr. Sentenced to Ten Years , Center for Defense Information.

After graduating from high school in 1986, Graner attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years before dropping out to join the Marine Corps Reserve in April 1988. He had the Marine Corps emblem and the letters \"USMC\" tattooed on his upper right biceps.Fuoco, Michael A., et al.

The couple had two children. Trained as a military policeman, he served in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. He was in the Marines until May 1996, when he left with the rank of lance corporal. ==Gulf War== Graner was deployed during the Gulf War, serving with the 2nd MP Co, originally of 4th FSSG, 4th Marine Division, a Marine Reserve unit based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On January 11, 1991, he arrived in Saudi Arabia, taking part in Operation Desert Storm. From there, he traveled to the largest prisoner-of-war camp near the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, where he worked for about six weeks. ==Prison guard== After his marriage, he moved to Butler, Pennsylvania, a steel industry area in southwestern Pennsylvania. In 1994, he began working as a corrections officer at Fayette County Prison in a shift with a \"no-nonsense reputation.\" Once, Graner was accused of putting mace in a new guard's coffee as a joke, causing him to be sick.Records Paint Dark Portrait Of Guard, The Washington Post, 2004-06-05. Retrieved 2008-07-07. In May 1996, he moved to the State Correctional Institution, Greene, a maximum-security prison in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Almost 70% of the inmates were black, many from large cities, but it was located in a rural part of the state and more than 90% of the guards were white.Unveiling the Face of the Prison Scandal, Los Angeles Times, 2004-06-19. Retrieved 2009-03-03. Guards at the prison were accused of beating and sexually assaulting prisoners and conducting cavity searches in view of other prisoners. There were also reports of racism, including reports of guards writing \"KKK\" in the blood of a beaten prisoner. In 1998, two guards were fired and 20 others were suspended, demoted or reprimanded for prisoner abuse.MP investigated in Iraq was at Pa. prison during abuse scandal, but not implicated , The San Diego Union-Tribune, 2004-05-07. Retrieved 2008-07-07. In 1998, a prisoner accused Graner and three other guards of planting a razor blade in his food, causing his mouth to bleed when he ate it. The prisoner accused the guards of first ignoring his cries for help and then punching and kicking him when they took him to the nurse. Graner was accused of telling him to \"Shut up, nigger, before we kill you.\" The allegations were denied; although a federal magistrate judge ruled that the charges had \"arguable merit in fact and law,\" the case was dismissed when the prisoner disappeared after his release. Graner and four other guards were accused of beating another prisoner who had deliberately flooded his cell, taunting anti-capital punishment protesters, using racial epithets and telling a Muslim inmate he had rubbed pork all over his tray of food. A second lawsuit involving Graner was brought by a prisoner who claimed that guards made him stand on one foot while they handcuffed and tripped him. This allegation, however, was ruled to have been made too late under the statute of limitations.Guard Left Troubled Life for Duty in Iraq, The New York Times, 2004-05-14. Retrieved 2008-07-07. ==Domestic abuse== In May 1997, Graner's wife and mother of their two children filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner had come to her house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her face with her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had \"yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to throw me down the steps.\" Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, \"I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead.\" Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted. Soon after, an order of protection was granted against Graner to protect his estranged wife. This resulted from Graner's comment to Dean that \"she could keep his guns, because he did not need them for what he was going to do to the plaintiff.\"Abuse scandal meets disbelief in hometowns.

Thirteen prisoners were interviewed by military investigators after the abuse allegations emerged. Eight of them named Graner as one of the abusers, and the other five described a person fitting his description.New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge, The Washington Post, 2004-05-21. Retrieved 2008-07-07. The investigation report named Graner as a ringleader of the abuse. One of the prisoners, Kasim Mehaddi Hilas, said that one day he asked Graner for the time so that he could pray. Graner handcuffed him to the bars of a cell window and left him there, feet dangling off the floor, for nearly five hours. On another occasion, Graner and other soldiers tied a prisoner to a bed and sodomized him with a phosphoric light while another soldier took photographs. Another prisoner, Abdou Hussain Saad Faleh, said Graner forced him to stand on a food box, naked except for a blanket. Another soldier then put a bag over his head and electrodes on his fingers, toes and penis. The picture of this incident was one of the first pictures whose publication prompted the investigation. A third prisoner, Mohanded Juma Juma, said Graner often threw food into the toilets and told the prisoners to eat it. Specialist Jeremy Sivits, a soldier who pleaded guilty to charges relating to the Abu Ghraib investigation, alleged that Graner once punched a prisoner in the head so hard that he lost consciousness.3 to Be Arraigned in Prison Abuse, The Washington Post, 2004-05-19.

According to Spc. Jason Kenner's testimony, al-Jamadi was brought to the prison by Navy SEALs in good health; Kenner says he saw that al-Jamadi looked extensively bruised when he was brought out of the showers, dead. According to Kenner a \"battle\" took place among CIA and military interrogators over who should dispose of the body. Capt. Donald Reese, company commander of 372nd Military Police Company, gave testimony about al-Jamadi's death, saying he saw the dead prisoner. Reese testified, \"I was told that when he was brought in, he was combative, that they took him up to the room and during the interrogation he passed.\"Soldier claims commander present at death of Abu Ghraib prisoner, ABC News, 2004-06-26.

The body was then autopsied, concluding that the cause of death was a blood clot from trauma. ** Prisoner Kasim Mehaddi Hilas testifies regarding his experiences at Abu Ghraib, telling investigators that Graner had cuffed him to the bars of a cell window, after Hilas had asked Graner what time it was because he wanted to pray. Graner left him, feet dangling above the floor, for almost five hours. Hilas also detailed events he had witnessed of Graner and some of his fellow soldiers sodomizing and otherwise abusing other detainees. These events were also detailed by other prisoners including some of the victims themselves. According to Hilas, Graner also \"repeatedly threw the detainees' meals into the toilets and said, 'Eat it.'\" ** Spec. Joseph M.

Upon being confronted by Darby, Graner responded, \"The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the corrections officer in me says, 'I love to make a grown man piss himself.\" ** Julie Scelfo and Rod Nordland of Newsweek reported, \"One military investigator wrote in his notes on Graner: 'the biggest S.O.B. on earth,' a comment he underlined twice.\"Beneath the Hoods , Newsweek.

On August 23, Graner appeared before military judge Colonel James Pohl at a high-security Army base in the city of Mannheim in southwest Germany. On that day, Article 39a hearings were held. These preliminary hearings usually function as an arraignment and allow the judge to hear and decide on motions made by the prosecutor and the defense. Graner appeared with Specialist Megan Ambuhl, along with his civilian attorneys and appointed military defense lawyers.Abu Ghraib Article 39A Hearings Held in Germany, U.S. Department of Defense, defenselink.mil.

Pohn set a deadline of September 10 for the government to provide the defense team with the documents requested, and ordered the release of a U.S. Army report performed by the Criminal Investigational Division on investigative procedures, as well as the Schlesinger panel report. Graner's attorney (as well as attorneys for several others charged) also moved to suppress evidence of statements made to Army investigators during interrogations, as well as seizure of a computer. Also requested was a change of venue, because some witnesses could not be compelled to come to Iraq to testify. In addition, the defense sought immunity from prosecution for several people so they may testify for the defense. The judge denied all three motions, and also ruled that video testimony and depositions could be used as evidence. ====October 22 hearing==== Another pre-trial hearing was held on October 22, at Camp Victory in Baghdad, with Pohl again presiding as judge. Pohl set January 7, 2005, as the trial date and again denied a defense motion to grant immunity to several witnesses so they could testify without fear of incrimination.Panel for Detainees' Cases Cut in Half, The Washington Post.

Reese was the unit commander and had been reprimanded in connection with Abu Ghraib; Sivits had already pleaded guilty in a plea bargain; Darby was the soldier who first reported the situation at Abu Ghraib. At the hearing several other possible witnesses were listed, including the prerecorded video depositions of three Iraqi prisoners\u2014two for the prosecution and one for the defense. Graner's lawyer, Guy Womack, said he was not sure whether Graner would testify for himself.

I still try to stay positive.\"CNN's American Morning Transcript, CNN. Retrieved 2009-03-05. ====Testimony==== Opening statements began on January 10. During this hearing, witness testimony began. Three soldiers in Graner's unit testified; the first was Specialist Matthew Wisdom, who first reported the situation at Abu Ghraib.

On January 11, military prosecutors also presented evidence not publicly released, including a video of forced group masturbation and a picture of a female prisoner being forced to show her breasts. ====Following orders==== The main defense was that Graner was following orders from, and supervised by, intelligence officers.Prosecuting Abuse, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 2004-05-10. Retrieved 2008-07-07. Graner and others testified that many senior officers were aware of the activities and actively supported them. This is why he was not worried about taking and distributing the photographs which were later used against him. Referring to military intelligence, Graner testified \"I nearly beat an MI detainee to death with MI there\" before Pohl cut him off. A formal complaint about the abuse was filed by Specialist Matthew Wisdom in November 2003 but was ignored by the military. Private Ivan Frederick (previously convicted of abuse) said he had consulted six senior officers, ranging from captains to lieutenant-colonels, about the guards' actions but was never told to stop. Despite this, the prosecution did not call any senior officers to testify. Womack suggests that this was not because they \"just forgot\" to do so.Guard Convicted In the First Trial From Abu Ghraib, The Washington Post. Retrieved 2009-03-05. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales had issued a memo which defined torture very narrowly as \"intentionally causing permanent damage to vital organs or permanent emotional trauma\". This would have excluded Graner's acts of intimidation.
