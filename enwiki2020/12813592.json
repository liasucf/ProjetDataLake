    "text": "Official flag of Cusco. The flag of Cusco is the official flag of Cusco, Peru. It is a rainbow flag. The order of the colors is: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Sky blue, Blue, Violet. The flag was introduced in 1973 by radio host Ra\u00fal Montesinos Espejo to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his Cusco station Tawantinsuyo Radio. In 1978, it was declared the official emblem of Cusco by mayor Gilberto Mu\u00f1iz Capar\u00f3. ==Origins== The question of the flag's historicity is closely rated to that of the wiphala or Aymara flag. Mar\u00eda Rostworowski in 2010 was cited as emphasizing the absence of any evidence of such a flag, \u00abI bet my life, the Inca never had that flag, it never existed, no chronicler mentioned it\u00bb and the Congress of the Republic of Peru has determined that flag is unsubstantiated by citing the conclusion of National Academy of Peruvian History to the effect that \"The official use of the wrongly called 'Tawantinsuyu flag' is a mistake. In the Pre-Hispanic Andean World there did not exist the concept of a flag, it did not belong to their historic context\". ==See also== * Cusco * Inca * Rainbow flag ==References== Category:Cusco Cuzco Category:Rainbow flags Cusco ",
