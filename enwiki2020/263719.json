    "text": "Image of Furfur from Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal. In demonology, Furfur (other spelling: Furtur, Ferthur) is a powerful Great Earl of Hell, being the ruler of twenty-six legions of demons. He is a liar unless compelled to enter a magic triangle where he gives true answers to every question, speaking with a rough voice. Furfur causes love between a man and a woman, creates storms, tempests, thunder, lightning, and blasts, and teaches on secret and divine things. He is depicted as a hart or winged hart, and also as an angel. To some authors he changes from hart into angel when compelled to enter the magic triangle. == Furfur in Latin == 'Furfur' or 'furfures' in Latin means \"bran\". However it seems more likely that the name is a corruption of 'furcifer', the Latin word for scoundrel.Oxford Latin Desk Dictionary, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, 410. ==See also== *The Lesser Key of Solomon *Peryton ==References== ==Sources== * S.
