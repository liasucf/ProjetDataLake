He won a total of nine top division y\u016bsh\u014d or tournament championships from 1929 to 1936, and was the dominant wrestler in sumo until the emergence of Futabayama. He died whilst still an active wrestler. ==Career== He was born . He joined Nishonoseki stable but the stable was very small at that time. Therefore, he often visited Dewanoumi stable and was trained by yokozuna Tochigiyama Moriya. He later became head coach of Nishonoseki stable whilst still active in the ring, and under his leadership the stable enjoyed one of its most successful periods in its history. Tamanishiki won three consecutive championships from October 1930 to March 1931, but he was not promoted to yokozuna. In January 1932, the broke out. The incident was the biggest walkout in sumo history. He was one of eleven top division wrestlers who remained in sumo and became the first head of , or the association of active sumo wrestlers. He won his fifth top division championship in May 1932 and was finally awarded a yokozuna licence in November 1932. He was the first yokozuna in sumo since the retirement of Miyagiyama a year and a half earlier. His promotion was seen as a reward for staying with the Sumo Association and helping them through the Shunjuen Incident. Tamanishiki often went to Tatsunami stable and trained wrestlers, such as later yokozuna Futabayama Sadaji. Tatsunami stable was small at that time, but the stable became stronger in the sumo world later on. Tamanishiki defeated Futabayama the first six times they met in competition, but he was never able to beat him again after Futabayama began his record winning run in 1936. Tamanishiki was the first yokozuna to raise one leg high while performing yokozuna dohy\u014d-iri (the yokozuna ring-entering ceremony). His style was said to have been beautiful and when Futabayama was promoted to yokozuna he emulated this style. This style is very popular now in yokozuna ceremonies. In 1938, Tamanishiki died while an active sumo wrestler, following a delayed appendectomy. ==Career Record== *In 1927 Tokyo and Osaka sumo merged and four tournaments a year in Tokyo and other locations began to be held. ==References== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of yokozuna Category:1903 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Yokozuna Category:Sumo people from K\u014dchi Prefecture Category:Sumo wrestlers who died while active ",
