    "text": "Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica is a professional football club based in Santiago, Chile, which plays in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, the top flight of Chilean football. Universidad Cat\u00f3lica is one of the most successful and popular Chilean football clubs and considered one of Chile's \"Big Three\". Its traditional rival is Universidad de Chile. They contest the Cl\u00e1sico Universitario. Colo-Colo is the other big rival of the club. Its official fight song is the Hymn of the Sports Club of the Catholic University, based on the song Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!. ==Overview== Universidad Cat\u00f3lica 1939 Universidad Cat\u00f3lica 1949 While the club was born as one of the many sport branches of the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, officially founded in 1937, it began, strictly speaking, around 1910, when students of the University would reunite to play football matches, frequently facing historical rival Universidad de Chile. In time, the idea of creating a professional club emerged, and on 21 April 1937, the club officially and legally began. It made its professional debut, in the second division, against the Universidad de Chile. Rivalry, both in sports and in academic issues, made these matches between the universities become more and more important, eventually reaching the national status of \"Universities' Derby\". The rivalry maintains itself until today, with each match between these teams being considered a must-see for every football fan in the country. The Universidad Cat\u00f3lica has attained fame as a favorite of the higher classes, because of many factors, which range from the location of the club's stadium, San Carlos de Apoquindo (in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of the capital) and Headquarters, although there are \"UC\" fans all around the country, including popular regions or towns. For this reason, is planned to build a new stadium in a more popular place of Santiago. Due to the neighborhood's strong influence (wealthy families), the club has been unable to be approved for projects to enlarge the stadium and thus draw larger crowds. Only until in recent years the club was allowed by the commune of Las Condes, to host their clasicos matches against Universidad de Chile and Colo-Colo in their own stadium. Although just a limited number of its rivals' supporters are allowed to be present at these matches due to security reasons inside the stadium and around its high-end neighborhood. The club has reached notoriety, both in a national and South American level, as the owner of one of the best infrastructures and training centers in the continent. As such, it is a good source of young talents, which occasionally rise to stardom in the club. Its most recent youth academy produced player known worldwide is Gary Medel, currently playing for Turkish side Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K., among other clubs such as Boca Juniors, Sevilla and Internazionale, as well as playing a big role in Chile's 2010 and 2014 World Cup squads. \"La Cato\" is the 3rd team that has won the most tournaments at a national level. The club has won 13 national tournaments and one international cup: Inter-American cup. Also, in 1993, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica was the runner-up in the most important international tournament in South America: the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica, losing in the finals against the biggest club in Brazil and defending Libertadores' Champion S\u00e3o Paulo They lost to what was considered the best team of the decade, a team that defeated Johan Cruyff's Barcelona Dream Team in 1992 and the Mighty Milan of Fabio Capelo em 1993. Between the two legs after a heavy defeat away la Catolica won the second leg but lost the title on aggregate. In 1997 the club celebrated its 60th anniversary with a friendly tournament where they beat Ajax Amsterdam 3\u20132 in the Copa 60\u00ba Aniversario de Universidad Cat\u00f3lica. In recent years, the club has been reemerged in international competition, advancing to the 2005 Copa Sudamericana semifinal before being knocked out by the powerful Boca Juniors from Argentina, who would go on to win the tournament. In 2006 the team made a good presentation in the Copa Libertadores, but was eliminated at the last minute by Tigres UANL of Mexico and failed to advance beyond the group stage. Universidad Cat\u00f3lica did not qualify for the 2007 Copa Libertadores. Cat\u00f3lica again played Copa Libertadores in 2008 with no luck, being eliminated in the group stage by goal difference by River Plate and Am\u00e9rica. In 2010, their performance was no better, finishing third in group stage behind Universidad de Chile and Flamengo. In the 2011 edition, Cat\u00f3lica finished first on the round robin, and then advanced to the quarter-finals, knocking out Gr\u00eamio of Brazil on the best 16 round, and falling to Pe\u00f1arol of Uruguay 2\u20130 in Montevideo and winning their home match 2\u20131, which was not enough to advance. In 2012 the club, under coach and former player Mario Lepe, finished last on the group stage, winning only 1 home game and losing on their away games in Colombia and Bolivia. ===Club information=== * Seasons in Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 79 (1939\u20131955, 1957\u20131973, 1976\u2013) * Seasons in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 3 (1956, 1974\u20131975) * Best Finish in Primera Divisi\u00f3n: Champions * Worst position in Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 18th * Best Finish in Copa Chile season: Champions * Best IFFHS position: 9th * Record Primera Divisi\u00f3n victory: 10\u20131 v.
