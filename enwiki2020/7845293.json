FNC's viewers were the first to see virtual reality news environments with customized local scenery in each of Florida's seven major television markets. FNC created nightly newscasts for a black audience. These newscasts were hosted by anchors Gordon Graham, Val Bracy, and Karla Winfrey. Frank Watson served as FNC's vice president and general manager. Partners included Willie E. Gary, Evander Holyfield, Cecil Fielder, Marlon Jackson, and Alvin James.
