    "text": "Fulton Street Farmers Market on opening Saturday of its 2013 summer season. Fulton Street Farmers Market is the longest-running farmers market in the Grand Rapids area. First opened in 1922, it is a popular destination for the city and its metropolitan area's residents. The market has 118 outdoor booths under a roof, and room for a small number of vendors in an indoor shopping hall, which also houses the information desk. The market opens four days a week from May to Christmas, and just Saturdays from January to April. The focus is on farm produce, with vendors providing locally grown produce getting first priority. Mobile food vendors such as food trucks and food carts also serve customers on its busier days. It is located just west of the intersection between Fulton Street East and Fuller Avenue NE in the Midtown area of Grand Rapids. An art market occupies the location on Sundays from June to September. == History == Newly completed indoor market hall and market office at Fulton Street Farmers Market. The Fulton Street Farmers Market is the oldest and largest in Grand Rapids. When it was established in 1922 there were three other markets in operation: a large wholesale market located on Market Street by the river and railroad tracks, a smaller market on Cottage Grove Avenue on the Southeast side of town, and one on the West side of town by the river on Leonard Street. Originally known as the East Side Market, the site where the Fulton Street Farmers Market currently sits was set aside by the city to ease traffic congestion caused by farmers selling produce block by block from their vehicles or wagons. In 1926, an office structure was built, which since the market office moved into a new building in 2013 has become occupied by the Midtown Neighborhood Association. Tanis Orchards has had the longest tenure of many loyal and regular vendors, dating back to 1931. There are a number of \"seasonal\" vendors (having first refusal on their booth during the entire season), and many daily vendors. A waiting list exists for the busiest market day, Saturday. The market underwent a $3 million renovation in 2012 and 2013. A roof was added in 2012 along with a refurbished outdoor market space and permanent stalls with electricity and lighting; while a year- round vendor building was opened in May 2013. The 2,000-square-foot space includes vendor space, restrooms, the market office and information desk. ==Payment Options== All eligible vendors at the market accept SNAP, Double Up Food Bucks, and WIC (including Project Fresh). The market was one of the largest included in a pilot program for mobile digital payments but on conclusion of that program it has reverted to using tokens to facilitate SNAP and Double Up payments. Some vendors accept credit/debit cards for payment via their own mobile devices. The market also sells $5 tokens, which have the same value as cash with all market vendors. ==Parking== Parking exists on the market site, which can be limited on the busiest days such as Saturdays. The nearby Salvation Army building, located across Fuller Avenue, offers its parking lot to market customers on Saturdays. Street parking is generally a possibility in the area. ==Transit== Bus stop and old market office at Fulton Street Farmers Market. The office building is now used by the Midtown Neighborhood Association. Rapid route 14 \"East Fulton\" serves the market with half-hourly service on weekdays and hourly service on Saturdays. The westbound/inbound stop was built into the new plaza that opened in 2012, moving from a location across Fuller Avenue. The eastbound/outbound stop is at the corner of Fuller Avenue, allowing pedestrians to cross with signal assistance at the intersection. Route 14 intersects with the new Silver Line at Fulton Street Station about a mile to the west, serves Heritage Hill and downtown Grand Rapids before reaching Central Station. ==Visitor Facilities== Restrooms are available at both the north and south ends of the market. Wifi is available to guests and vendors. An ATM is present in the indoor vendors' hall at the south end. Bicycle racks are located at each end. Parking for disabled is located in the center of the market. ==References== ==External links== *Fulton Street Farmers Market website *Fulton Street Artisans Market website Category:Farmers' markets in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Rapids, Michigan ",
