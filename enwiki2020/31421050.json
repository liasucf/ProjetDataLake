His wife, Betsy Karel, and chair to the Trellis Fund, provided a $2.0 million grant to UF creating the nation\u2019s first endowed chair in public interest communications. The Frank Karel Chair in Public Interest Communications was created to field research and practice of public interest communications and strategies. Its goal is to define the field as a tool for advancing organizations\u2019 missions and goals in public and nonprofit sectors. The grant allowed the department of public relations to recruit a practitioner to mentor and direct students who are preparing for careers in public service. The Frank Prize in Public Interest research was established in 2014 by the University of Florida in honor of Frank Karel. == References == == External links == * * University of Florida Communigator, \"In Memoriam\" by Sarah A.
