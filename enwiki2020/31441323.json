In December 1948, tenders were called for 30 sets of engines, gearboxes, electrical assemblies and compressors. The contract for the engines was awarded to Cummins while the contract for the eight-speed gearboxes was awarded to Cotal of France. All of the engines had been received by May 1952, but problems with the gearboxes meant the first did not arrive until January 1954. Cotal subsequently ceased trading in April 1954 with only six gearboxes having been delivered, so an alternative source was found.\"250, 100, 280 Class Railcars of the South Australian Railways\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 564 October 1984 pages 213-236 Twenty-one Bluebirds were manufactured by the South Australian Railways' Islington Railway Workshops. The fleet consisted of 11 second-class passenger power cars (250 class), three baggage power cars (280 class) and seven first-class passenger trailer cars (100 class). They were first introduced in October 1954; the last unit entered service on 12 November 1959.\"Here & There\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin volume 209 March 1955 page 38\"Trial Runs of New Diesel Railcars\" Railway Gazette 9 September 1955 page 300\"Australasia\" Diesel Railway Traction April 1956 page 134\"Famous Name Trains: Blue Birds\" Network November 1964 page 3 Their excellent ride, quietness and airconditioning set a new standard in Australian railcars. The 100 and 250 class were named after birds; the unnamed 280 class baggage cars only carried road numbers.Bluebird Railcars 280 to 282 Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages They operated services on the broad-gauge network from Adelaide to Burra, Gladstone, Moonta, Morgan, Mount Gambier, Nuriootpa, South Australia, Port Pirie, Tailem Bend, Terowie (extended to Peterborough in 1970) and Victor Harbor.\"250, 100, 280 Class Railcars of the South Australian Railways\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 565 November 1984 pages 251-260\"250, 100, 280 Class Railcars of the South Australian Railways\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 566 December 1984 pages 268-280The Bluebird Railcars of the South Australian Railways The Railways of South Australia & Victoria Each Bluebird was powered initially by a pair of Cummins NHHS-600 engines, which were replaced between 1959 and 1965 by Cummins NHHRS engines and again by Cummins NT 855 engines between 1975 and 1977.\"Here & There\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 443 September 1974 page 8 Auxiliary power was provided by a General Motors 3-71 engine, later replaced by a Deutz unit. In 1971\u201372, cars 101, 105, 106, 250-253 and 257-259 were fitted with buffet facilities. In March 1978 all Bluebirds were included in the transfer of the assets of South Australian Railways to Australian National. In 1986, a new computer system required the class leaders to be renumbered as the last member of the class: hence 100 became 107, 250 became 261 and 280 became 283.\"Australian National Broken Hill Line Report\" Railway Digest October 1986 page 314\"Here & There\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin volume 591 January 1987 page 2 By 1985, ten Bluebirds had been fitted with standard-gauge bogies for use on services to Port Pirie, Whyalla and Broken Hill.\"Bluebird Railcar Conversions\" Catch Point issue 45 April 1985\"South Australia\" Railway Digest April 1985 page 119\"Bluebirds to Broken Hill\" Catch Point issue 58 March 1987 page 14 One was fitted with 20 poker machines, operating tours to Broken Hill from April 1988 to February 1993.\"Pokies on a Bluebird\" Catch Point issue 69 January 1989 page 22\"Catering Facilities of the Former South Australian Railways\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin volume 708 October 1996 page 303 In 1989, shortly before all South Australian country passenger services were withdrawn, the 100 class trailers began to be used as sitting carriages on the Indian Pacific and The Overland.\"Bluebird Trailers for Head End Working\" Catch Point issue 74 November 1989 page 24\"Here & There\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin volume 627 January 1990 page 22\"Here & There\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin volume 629 March 1990 page 73\"Loco Hauled Cars\" Railway Digest\" May 1990 page 191 Some were also converted for use as crew carriages on Trans-Australian Railway services.Bluebird Railcar Driving Trailers 100 to 107 Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesBluebird Railcars 250 to 260 Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages The last were withdrawn in January 1993 and placed in store at Mile End and later Islington Railway Workshops.
