    "text": "Bleien Radio Observatory is a radio astronomy observatory located halfway between Zurich and Bern in Switzerland. Its focus is on large bandwidth radio spectroscopy. The observatory is near the village of Bleien, 5 km south of Gr\u00e4nichen in the Canton of Aargau. The place is in a shallow valley that is relatively well protected against terrestrial interference.Committee on Radio Astronomy Frequencies, == History == The observatory was built in 1979 by the Institute for AstronomyInstitute for Astronomy,http://www.astro.ethz.ch/ at ETH Zurich under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Arnold O. Benz. Since that time it consists of two parabolic antennae of 7 m and 5 m diameter separated by 100 m and a lab building containing the spectrometers and other electronics. For the first time, a fully digitized and remotely controlled receiver was used.M.R. Perrenoud, The Computer-controlled Solar Radio Spectrometer \"Ikarus\", Solar Physics, 81, 197-203 (1982), http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/data/Descriptions/ikarus.pdf Frequency-agile spectrometers were applied initially. Now digital filter banks and FFT (Fast Fourier transform) spectrometers are in operation.A.O. Benz, C. Monstein, M. Beverland, H. Meyer, B. Stuber, High Spectral Resolution Observation of Decimetric Radio Spikes Emitted by Solar Flares, Solar Physics, 260, 375-388 (2009), http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2009SoPh..260..375B The initial frequency range of 100 - 1000 MHz was enlarged to 10 MHz - 5 GHz. This range is the largest for solar radio observations since 2005. Starting in 2014, the observatory is being converted to observe preferentially non-solar radiation of extragalactic and cosmological origin. == Science== The primary goal was the observation of radio emissions of solar flares. The most significant contribution was the survey and classification at decimeter wavelength (ultra high frequency).M. Guedel and A.O. Benz, A catalogue of decimetric solar flare radio emission, Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement, 75, 243-259 (1988), http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph- data_query?bibcode=1988A%26AS...75..243G&link;_type=ARTICLE&db;_key=AST&high;=H. Isliker and A.O. Benz, Catalogue of 1-3 GHz solar flare radio emission, Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement, 104, 145-160 (1994), http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph- data_query?bibcode=1994A%26AS..104..145I&link;_type=ARTICLE&db;_key=AST&high;= The data are crucial for investigating the acceleration of energetic electrons in solar flares. The broad bandwidth was also used to study non-solar radio emissions of gamma-ray bursts and to search for fast radio bursts, transients of possibly extragalactic origin. The solar data since 1979 and the instrument descriptions are stored at the Institute of 4D TechnologiesInstitute of 4D Technologies,http://www.fhnw.ch/engineering/i4ds/homepage?set_language=en at Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz FHNW in Windisch and are public.Bleien Solar Radio Data, http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/ The Bleien Radio Observatory was the starting point of the international e-CALLISTO networke-CALLISTO, International Network of Solar Radio Spectrometers, http://www.e-callisto.org/ that surveys solar activity and space weather 24 hours per day in radio waves. ==References== Category:Radio telescopes Category:Solar observatories Category:ETH Zurich Category:Astronomical observatories in Switzerland ",
