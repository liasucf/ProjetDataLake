The region\u2019s isolation and difficult terrain were natural barriers to development.'Heritage and History of Warringah * The Wheeler family, originally from Somerset, England, were one of the first families in the (Wheeler Heights) area. James Wheeler (1810-1890), a free settler who already owned land at Dee Why, purchased 150 acres in January 1842 made up of 100 acres on South Creek and 50 acres on Narrabeen Lagoon, where his family remained for over 100 years. In the years that followed, he purchased further land in the area and the Wheeler homestead was a feature of the southern shore of Narrabeen Lagoon. The remains of a stone weir from the former Wheeler Estate can be seen protruding from the shoreline of Narrabeen Lagoon near James Wheeler Place. The Wheeler Estate was broken up after the Second World War. * The Wheeler family name has been used in James Wheeler Place and the suburb name Wheeler Heights, while other street names of Wheeler Heights reflect the towns and villages of The Lakes District, Cumbria, England, as well as many of the geographical features of the landscape. The names of some of the lakes are the names of Derwent St, Coniston St and Windermere Place. Ambleside St and Penrith Ave are names of larger towns in the lakes district. The dales are a particular feature of the lakes district and have given their names to Ennerdale Crescent and Langdale Place. ===The naming of Wheeler Heights=== 'How a school gave a suburb its name''How a school gave a suburb its name' Stan Walters, Manly Daily June 16, 2010 p 22'Wheelerless suburbs' John Morcombe, Manly Daily March 10, 2007 'Collaroy Plateau and Wheeler Heights to get their names back' 'Collaroy Plateau and Wheeler Heights to get their names back' Brenton Cherry, Manly Daily July 24, 2010 'Our suburbs saved' 'Our suburbs saved' Brenton Cherry, Manly Daily Feb 18 2011, p3 In 1961 Collaroy Plateau West Primary School was built. The school has access from Rose Ave, Berith St and Veterans Pde. Over the next six years buses used for taking Collaroy Plateau West Primary school sports teams to interschool sports on Friday afternoons frequently went to the wrong school - Collaroy Plateau Primary School due to the similarity of the name of the two schools. In 1969 there was an opportunity to change the name of the school and avoid the problem of two schools with very similar names. The name was changed to Wheeler Heights Public School. This was at the suggestion of Stan Walters, a teacher at the school who was interested in the local history. Wheeler Heights became the commonly used name by locals for the streets surrounding the school, including the name for the shopping strip in South Creek Road, Wheeler Heights. In 1977 Wheeler Heights was registered as a suburb by the Geographical Names Board.Geographical Names Board In 2002 both Wheeler Heights and Collaroy Plateau were stripped of their suburb status by the Geographical Names Board and were downgraded to \u2018urban places\u2019.
