His style contained elements of impressionism with the influences of \u00c9douard Manet, Monet and of the Pointillists discernible in his work. Le Sidaner favoured a subdued use of colour, preferring nuanced greys and opals applied with uneven, dappled brushstrokes to create atmosphere and mysticism. A skilled nocturne painter he travelled widely throughout France and Europe before settling at Gerberoy in the Picardy countryside from where he painted for over thirty years.Yann Farinaux- Le Sidaner, Le Sidaner, (1989) L\u2019Oeuvre peint et grav\u00e9, \u00c9ditions Andr\u00e9 Sauret, Monaco. ==Early years== Le D\u00e9part De Tobie (1894) L'Eau morte (1901) Henri Le Sidaner was born August 7, 1862 at Port Louis in Mauritius, where his Breton parents Jean Marie (1828 - 1880) and Am\u00e9lie Henrietta (n\u00e9e Robberechts) were living. His father Jean Marie was a ship inspector for Lloyd\u2019s whose business took the family back to France in 1872His father was lost in a storm in the English channel on 15 September 1880 when Le Sidaner was 18 years oldThe remainder of his childhood was spent in Dunkerque where he attended the Coll\u00e8ge et Lyc\u00e9e Notre Dame des Dunes and where he met and befriended Eug\u00e8ne Chigot who was to become a lifelong friend and supporter.Antoine Descheemaeker- Colle (2008),Eug\u00e8ne Chigot, Sa Vie, Son Oevre Peint, Editions Henri, France. in french He showed aptitude for painting, in which he was supported by his parents, and attended art classes at the atelier of Alphonse Chigot and with a teacher who had been a pupil of Philippe-Jacques van Bree. Le Sidaner\u2019s interests in the use of colour, softness of form and in painting in the gloaming light were formed during this period as he sort an artistic cure in naturalism and En plein air painting. \u00c9taples had a tradition of en plain air painting established by Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny (1817\u20131878), who retreated there from the outbreak of the Paris Commune in 1871 and of the local Deauville painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin (1824\u20131898), a leading post impressionist. In the late nineteenth- century numerous artists were drawn by the sand dunes, the atmospheric light and the remnants of an older France. In particular artists from the United States, Australia and the British Isles settled around \u00c9taples in a loose collective. Most left at the outset of Great War in 1914 as Flanders became part of the Western Front.Edith Marcq (2019), La C\u00f4te d'Opale et ses peintres au XIX \u00e8me si\u00e8cle \u00e0 la fin de l'entre-deux- guerres: l'individualit\u00e9 de son appellation \u00e0 ses diverses repr\u00e9sentations picturales, in french. Le Sidaner stayed at \u00c9taples for twelve years preferring to work in isolation. In the meantime a febrile debate into the meaning of art was gathering apace in Paris. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants was founded in 1884 whilst movements such as Pointillism with their exuberant use of colour were undermining the foundations of academicism.Karl Ruhrberg, (1998). \"Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists\". Art of the 20th Century, Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, . Against this background in 1887 Le Sidaner sent his first painting to the Paris Salon followed in 1888 by La Promenade des Orphelines one of his most celebrated early works. La Benediction De La Mer exhibited in 1890 was awarded with a third place medal and a travel stipend to visit Rome where Le Sidaner made surviving copies of works by Giotto and Fra Angelico. La Benediction De La Mer is a painting with distinctly religious undertones. It is nostalgic and sentimental and the scene is set against an ethereal, atmospheric sky.http://henri.lesidaner.com/project/la-benediction-de-la-mer-etaples-1891/ La B\u00e9n\u00e9diction de la mer, \u00c9taples, 1891 Le Sidaner became close friends with the Norwegian landscape artist Frits Thaulow and they travelled to The Netherlands in 1891, a visit that produced a number of paintings including Jong meisje in de duinen (Young Woman in the Dunes)(1891)https://studio2000.nl/en/henri-le-sidaner/jong-meisje-in-de-duinen and Fillette au jardin (1894), an intimist painting of Thaulow's daughter unusual for the brightness of the colours that Le Sidaner choose for the little girl. https://studio2000.nl/en/henri-le-sidaner/fillette-au-jardin Le Sidaner's landscape paintings of the period reveal a fascination with the effect of light changes on the sensibilities, particularly at dusk. Whilst the impressionists and the pointillists favoured the use of bright colour to express emotion Le Sidaner began working in tonal, pastel colours and used a lighter palette to create moonlight landscapes. The theme had been explored by Jean-Charles Cazin (1840 - 1901), an older artist also from the Pas-de-calais, who became known for his views of uninhabited streets, often illuminated by a single light coming from a window. Le Sidaner used the same motif many times in the course of his career.American Art Association (2018) Catalogue of Paintings by Jean-Charles Cazin: Exhibited Under the Management of the American Art Association, Forgotten Books ==The Inspiration of Bruges== A Bruges Canal French art witnessed something akin to a schism in 1890 when a group of established artists that included: Puvis de Chavannes, Ernest Meissonier, Carolus-Duran and Carrier-Belleuse, frustrated at what they saw as the atavistic philosophy of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais, decided to revitalise, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts. They organised an independent exhibition for the work of artists that did not fit the criteria for acceptance by the Paris Salon. The move received government support and the prestigious space of the Champs-de-Mars galleries originally built for the 1878 Exposition Universelle.http://www.artistes- independants.fr/index.php?page=historique&chlangue;=us Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants, History]Le Sidaner was one of the younger artists who preferred to send work to the new Salon and in 1894 he sent two paintings Neige and the symbolist Le D\u00e9part De Tobie. In 1895 Le Sidaner left \u00c9taples and moved to a suburb of Paris where he became part of an artistic clique that included the musician Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and the art dealer, George Petit, to whom Le Sidaner entrusted the sale of his future work.The move to Paris was likely made for career reasons. Le Sidaner much preferred a solitary existence in the French countryside. Whatever the prime reason the Paris stay was short but significant, as in 1898 he eloped to Bruges with the twenty two year old Camille Navarre, to whom he was subsequently married. Laura Gascoigne (2014), Henri Le Sidaner: the artist who fell between two schools, The Spectator magazine 10 May 2014The success of the Belgian Les XX group of artists had positioned Bruges as a city that was responsive to new ideas and ways of thinking Jane Block (1984), Les XX and Belgian Avant-Gardism 1868\u20131894, Studies in Fine Arts: The Avant garde, Ann Arbor: UMI Research press. and for Le Sidaner the years in Bruges were pivotal to his subsequent artistic career. It was in Bruges that Le Sidaner painted a series of nocturnes exploring the gloaming light around dusk. They possess a mysticism and convey the silence behind the walls and beneath the waters of Bruges' many canals. La Tour, Bruges (1890) is a strong example of his Bruges period. The Tower is displayed against a sombre blue sky whose light is fading fast. The bottom of the picture is in darkness save for the favoured motif of two solitary lights through a window. In another twi-light painting Cr\u00e9puscule, Maisons Quai De Rosaire (1900)http://www.artnet.com/artists/henri-le-sidaner/cr%C3%A9puscule- maisons-quai-du-rosaire-QcCY0647ROPj3fqXP2dV_A2 the sombre palette is again off-set by the familiar motif of a lighted window casting its penumbra across the silent waters of the canal. ==The move to Gerberoy and international success.== The Grand Canal, Venice (1906) Le Sidaner held successful solo exhibitions at one of George Petit\u2019s Galleries in 1897 and at the La Libre Esth\u00e9tique in Brussels in 1898. He was keen to buy a country property where he could create a garden and work in reflective solitude. It was on the advice of ceramist Auguste Delaherche that he rented a neglected property at Gerberoy in the Picardy countryside that he subsequently bought in 1904. Yann Farinaux- Le Sidaner, Le Sidaner, (1989) L\u2019Oeuvre peint et grav\u00e9, \u00c9ditions Andr\u00e9 Sauret, Monaco. B00166TYK4 Once at Gerberoy, Le Sidaner rarely painted figures again preferring to create impressionistic moods through objects that imply human presence. Gali\u00e8gue, Wittmer, Farinaux Le-Sidaner (2001), Henri Le Sidaner en son jardin de Gerberoy, 1901- 1939, Editions d'art Monelle Hayot, He also set upon the creation of a magnificent garden to rival Monet's at Giverny.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MWZ4qnG5FA Royal Academy Curator Ann Dumas introduces Henri Le Sidaner's garden at Gerberoy, Picardy, In 1902 Le Sidaner joined his old friend Eug\u00e8ne Chigot for an extended visit to Gravelines and Gisors Antoine Descheemaeker- Colle (2008), Sa Vie, son oeuvre peint, Editions Henri, France. The preference for a few years was to avoid the harsh Oise winters and encamp to milder climes. In 1903 Le Sidaner spent the winter at Chartres and in 1906 in Venice where according to his biographer Mauclair he completed some of his greatest masterpieces. Initially displayed at the salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts they paved the way for a major exhibition in London in 1907/8 where Le Sidaner created a series of works featuring London and Hampton Court Palace and its gardens.Goupil Gallery, London, \"Hampton Court and London: A Small Series of Pictures by Henri Le Sidaner,\" 1908; The paintings from London possess a dreamlike quality.Marcel Proust. In Search of Lost Time Vol. IV Sodom and Gomorrah. Trans. C.K. Scott Moncrieff. New York: Modern Library, 2003. 278. As recently as 2012 art critic C.B. Liddell noted that he was set in an ever-lasting , default twilight, the same moment eternally perpetuated in painting after painting to the detriment that the viewer never has a sense of Le Sidaner's true feelings.C.B.Liddle (2012), Henri Le Sidaner: The Painter Who Loved Roses and Moonlight at the Museum of Modern Art, Saitama, Japan Times Yet at the time of his death in Versailles on 16 July 1939 his work was f\u00eated in France and abroad and Le Sidaner was a wealthy man. His reputation declined during the post World War Two period but has since received a revaluation with exhibitions (selected) dedicated to his work at: Musee d'art moderne et contemporain of Liege (1996), Musee de la chartreuse, Douai (2001), Musee of Pont-Aven (2002) and Hiroshima Museum of Art (2012) == Notes == ==Biography== Alphonse Chigot (1881}, watercolour. * Camille Mauclair (1928) English translation A Rickard (2019), Henri Le Sidaner, The Obolous Press, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada. * Yann Farinaux- Le Sidaner, (1989) Le Sidaner, L\u2019Oeuvre peint et grav\u00e9, \u00c9ditions Andr\u00e9 Sauret, Monaco. * Henri Le Sidaner, 1862-1939 et la Bretagne : Exposition, Pont-Aven, Mus\u00e9e de Pont-Aven, 29 juin-30 septembre 2002 - Exhibition catalogue. ==Bibliography== * Yann Farinaux-Le Sidaner, Catalog raisonn\u00e9 of the Work of Henri Le Sidaner, \u00c9ditions Andr\u00e9 Sauret,(1989). * Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mancel, Josette Gali\u00e8gue, et al,(2001) Henri le Sidaner en son jardin de Gerberoy, \u00c9ditions Monelle Hayot.
