    "text": "Croatian cuisine is heterogeneous and is known as a cuisine of the regions, since every region of Croatia has its own distinct culinary tradition. Its roots date back to ancient times. The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier Slavic and the more recent contacts with Hungarian and Turkish cuisine, using lard for cooking, and spices such as black pepper, paprika, and garlic. The coastal region bears the influences of the Greek and Roman cuisine, as well as of the later Mediterranean cuisine, in particular Italian (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use olive oil, herbs and spices such as rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and lemon and orange rind. Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several basic ingredients (cereals, dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices. Charcuterie is part of the Croatian culinary tradition in all regions. Food and recipes from other former Yugoslav countries are also popular in Croatia. Croatian cuisine can be divided into several distinct cuisines (Istria, Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, Lika, Gorski Kotar, Zagorje, Me\u0111imurje, Podravina, Slavonija) each of which has specific cooking traditions, characteristic for the area and not necessarily well known in other parts of Croatia. Most dishes, however, can be found all across the country, with local variants. ==Meat and game== * Specialities from the grill are called s ro\u0161tilja, those roasted on the spit s ra\u017enja * pe\u010deno means roasted * pr\u017eeno means fried * pod pekom means that the dish has been put into a stone oven under a metal cover. The cook puts hot coals on the cover so that the meal is cooked slowly in its own juices. Specialties cooked pod pekom include lamb, veal, and octopus. * na le\u0161o means boiled in broth or water (lamb, beef, fish) \u2013 pork from \"tiblitsa\" wooden barrel from Me\u0111imurje County, northern Croatia Croatian meat-based dishes include: *Pork *Mije\u0161ano meso or Ra\u017enji\u0107i (skewers) *Zagreba\u010dki odrezak (Veal steaks stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded and fried) *\u0160nicle (schnitzel) \u2013 breaded veal, pork or chicken cutlets * \u2013 pork ham from Me\u0111imurje County *Janjetina \u2013 roasted lamb garnished with Mediterranean herbs *Odojak \u2013 roasted suckling pig *Fresh game from Dalmatia *Visova\u010dka begavica *Turkey with mlinci (flat pasta, soaked in roast juices) *Buncek \u2013 smoked pork hock, used in bean, sauerkraut or kale stews *Leg of lamb \u00e0 la Pa\u0161ticada *Leg of venison the count's way *Wild duck with sauce *Polpete, fa\u0161iranci \u2013 Frikadeller *Roasted pheasant *Kotlovina from Samobor (kettle with knuckle of pork and other meat and sausages) *Boiled fillet of beef haunch with Sauerkraut *Escalope \u00e0 la Baron Trenk (spicy-rolled Schnitzel) *Me\u0111imurje Goose (stuffed with buckwheat) *Turopolje Goose (with corn semolina as a side dish) *Purgerica Turkey (Christmas dish from the bordering region to Zagreb, turkey filled with chestnuts, apples, bacon, lemons, etc.) *Krvavice, or \u010durke, blood sausages, made of blood and ka\u0161a *Hladetina, a particular type of head cheese *Bra\u010dki vitalac *Edible dormouse \u2013 eaten on the Dalmatian coast according to Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. ==Seafood== Lobster from Dalmatia Croatian seafood dishes include: *Squid \u2013 Croatian: lignje, Italian: calamari, grilled, fried, stuffed or prepared as stew and served with polenta *Octopus salad \u2013 Croatian: salata od hobotnice; octopus can also be prepared brudet style, with red wine, or baked pod pekom *Cuttlefish risotto \u2013 Croatian: Crni ri\u017eot, Italian: Risotto nero *Tuna *Scampi \u2013 Croatian: \u0161kampi, Italian: scampi *Common mussels \u2013 Croatian: dagnje *Salted cod is imported, but dishes are very popular for Christmas Eve or on Good Friday.

Stewed meat dishes are often prepared by men in open spaces, following hunting and shepherding traditions. In Dalmatian urban cuisine, spices such as cinnamon and clove, dried plums, dried figs, apples and other fruit are sometimes added to meat stews.
