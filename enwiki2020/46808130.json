German magazine 11 Freunde has described it as \"the best football academy\" in Iran, and unique in terms of being dedicated to \"sustainable, conceptual youth work\". The club follows the TSG 1899 Hoffenheim-model, i.e. starting at grassroots-level before developing into a team that can enter the professional leagues. Each year, the club scouts more than a thousand players from all across the country and after trials, only retains top 25 talents. KIA has shown remarkable results since its foundation and frequently travels to Europe in order to play against renowned opponents. ==Current squads== === U17 === === U16 === :These players can also play with the U17 squad. == Current staff == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- | Mehdi Mahdavikia || Academy Manager |- |Hadi Mahdavikia|| U14 Head Coach |- | Mohammad Ansari ||U16 Team Manager |- | Ghasem Mahdavikia || U14 Team Manager |- | Alireza Karami || Media Manager |- | Hesam Zeytouninejad || U14 Assistant Coach |} == Honours == === Domestic league competitions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| League !Title(s) !
