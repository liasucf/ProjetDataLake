    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Demonstration tournament was played from 14 to 20 October 1968 at three venues in Guadalajara, Mexico: Guadalajara Country Club, Atlas Sports Club and Guadalajara Sports Club; all of them featured clay courts. All matches were played at best-of-five sets; since the tiebreak rule was not implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Spaniard Manuel Santana won the tournament by defeating his compatriot Manuel Orantes 2\u20136, 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20134 in the final. American Herb Fitzgibbon won the third place. ==Seeds== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top Half=== ===Bottom Half=== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Demonstration ",
