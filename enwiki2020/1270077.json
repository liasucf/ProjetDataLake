    "text": "Lamego (; ) is a city and municipality in the Viseu District, in the Norte Region of the Douro in northern Portugal. Located on the shores of the Balsem\u00e3o River, the municipality has a population of 26,691,Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica in an area of 165.42 km2. With origins before the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Lamego is known for its historic city center, having a long history as a principal city of the former Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. Legend holds that the first Portuguese Cortes were held in Lamego, in 1143. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego is based in the city center. ==Etymology== The toponymic name Lamego was derived from Lamaecus, a name Roman-Hispanic derivative to indicate the possessor of agrarian titles in the 3rd century around the local castle.M. Gon\u00e7alves da Costa (1977), p.45 ==History== Lamego Castle, with origins in the 5th century. The area around Lamego was inhabited by Ligures and Turduli, and during the Roman presence it was occupied by Coelerni, which left behind several monuments. Due to the placement of the castle, it is likely that a castro originally existed on the site. During the Inquiri\u00e7\u00f5es (Inventory/Enquiries) of King Afonso (during the 13th century) there was reference to the Castro de Lameco, referred to as a medieval fortification. Destroyed by the Romans, the inhabitants were forced to descend into the valley and cultivate the land, as part of the Roman reorganization of the land. ===Middle Ages=== Lamego became Catholic when the Visigothic king Rekared I converted to Catholicism. In 569, during the Council of Lugo, there appeared references to Sardin\u00e1rio the Bishop of Lamego. During the reign of Sisebuto (612-621), the Visigothic monarch coined currency from Lamego, indicating the importance of the region to commerce and culture. Just outside the city center is the tiny 7th century S\u00e3o Pedro de Balsem\u00e3o Chapel, a Visigothic chapel believed to be the oldest in Portugal (and second oldest in Europe). A region alternated between peace and war in the following years as Christians and Muslims fought the territory during the Reconquista, until Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile conquered the region definitively on 29 November 1057. As a consequence the bishopric was moved after these events (to later be restored in 1071). In 1128, the nascent national Egas Moniz, had his tenancy in Lamego while his residence was in Britiande, as master of the Riba\u2013Douro, between Paiva and T\u00e1vora (in addition to the lands of C\u00f4a). The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, built in 1129. The most significant moment in the town's history was in 1139, when nobles declared Afonso Henriques to be Portugal's first king. The town's Gothic cathedral was built by him, although only the Romanesque tower is left from the original building, with its carved Renaissance portal and fine cloister dating from the 16th and 18th centuries. The 12th-century castle preserves a fine keep and a very old and unusual cistern with monograms of master masons. King Sancho I issued a charter of independence in 1191, as the local community grew around two poles: the ecclesiastical parishes of S\u00e9 and Castelo. In 1290, King Denis provided a market charter to the city, attracting merchants from Castile and Granada with their oriental spices and textiles. Lamego had a privileged positioned on the routes from western Iberia, as a transit point within the settlements of the Al\u00e9m-Douro, Braga and Guimar\u00e3es, from Alc\u00e2ntara and M\u00e9rida to C\u00f3rdoba and Seville. It was also one of the preferred routes on the Saint James Way pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. But, two events changed the economic and social circumstances in the region: the conquest of Granada which drove the last of the Moors from the Peninsula; and the discovery of the maritime connection to India, which resulted in a slow decline for the region. ===Early modern era=== Sanctuary of Our Lady of Rem\u00e9dios, built in 1750. Manuel I of Portugal issued a foral (charter) in 1514. Also in the 16th century, Manuel de Noronha (one of the more notable prelates of Lamego) was appointed the Bishop of Lamego, occupying the role for the next 18 years and referred to the \"great builder\", responsible for the cult of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios (Our Lady of Remedies). In the 17th and 18th century, the solares (country estates) were slowly constructed in Lamego, resulting from the wine commerce down the Douro. The economic growth of viticulture along the Douro resulted in the issuance of a writ by Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, to designate the area as the Regi\u00e3o Demarcada do Douro and the establishment of the Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro (General Company of the Wine Agriculture of the Upper Douro). In 1835, Lamego was the capital of the district, but lost this title to Viseu (December 1835), under the authority of the King's Minister Lu\u00eds Mouzinho de Albuquerque. In 1919, in an attempt to restore the monarchy, Lamego became the capital of the district for 24 days. During the second half of the 19th century, during the presidency of the Viscount of Guedes Teixeira, Lamego begins a process of modernization with the construction of new avenues. After the establishment of the First Republic, during the presidency of Alfredo de Sousa, Lamego undergoes a new phase of building, including the construction a bridge over the Coura River. ==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities== * Bouchemaine, France ==Geography== ===Human geography=== Administratively, the municipality is divided into 18 civil parishes (freguesias): * Lamego (Almacave e S\u00e9) * Av\u00f5es * Bigorne, Magueija e Pretarouca * Britiande * Cambres * Cep\u00f5es, Meijinhos e Melc\u00f5es * Ferreirim * Ferreiros de Av\u00f5es * Figueira * Lalim * Lazarim * Parada do Bispo e Valdigem * Penaj\u00f3ia * Penude * Samod\u00e3es * Sande * V\u00e1rzea de Abrunhais * Vila Nova de Souto d'El-Rei ==Economy== Our Lady of Rem\u00e9dios Park.
