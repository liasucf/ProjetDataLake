The City Police Commissioner, the Lady Mayor Sethulakshmi (Mohini) of Kochi Corporation and a couple of corrupt ministers and officials are supporting the illegal activities of Williams. In the age-old battle between the 'Good' and the 'Evil', Avinash Varma wins as expected, and his truth and honesty rewarded. ==Production== The film ran into financial troubles when its shooting was mid way.

Veeyen of nowrunning.com gave a negative review and said \"Collector fits into the socio-political thriller genre in Malayalam films to the 'T'. The film tries to speak a lot, but the fact is that not many are in a mood to listen. For, we have seen it all\" and gave 1.5 stars of 5. Indiaglitz gave a positive review and said \"The highlights of the movie are the brilliant production values starting from its awesome title graphics to excellent cinematography by Manoj Paramahamsa. Some of the dialogues in the former half and climax are indeed interesting, though that is not the case with the entire movie.\" Sify.com rated the movie as positive and said \"Collector is loud, formulaic and tailor made for those who are addicted to the age old good versus evil sagas. For those who get thrilled when the hero renders lines of dialogues to virtually everyone around and takes on a dozen hunks with sheer grit, this may be a fine film. For the rest of the world, this may not be such an exciting experience. The choice is yours!\". ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack features four songs composed by Reghu Kumar. The songs as well as choreography received largely positive reviews. The songs managed to average the music charts in the initial weeks. This was the last work of Reghu Kumar, who died in 2014. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%;\" ! Track # !! Song !! Singer(s)!!
