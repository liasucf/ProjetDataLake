    "text": "Targa Tasmania is a tarmac-based rally event held on the island state of Tasmania, Australia, annually since 1992. The event takes its name from the Targa Florio, a former motoring event held on the island of Sicily. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the Mille Miglia, the Coupe des Alpes and the Tour de Corse. == Rally format == The rally started as a five-day event, but has been run as a six-day event for anniversaries in 2001, 2006 and 2016. The layout of the 2016 event was: * Leg 1 Launceston - George Town - Launceston * Leg 2 Launceston - St Helens - Launceston * Leg 3 Launceston - Sheffield - Launceston * Leg 4 Launceston - Stanley - Strahan * Leg 5 Strahan - New Norfolk - Hobart * Leg 6 Hobart - Hobart In 2008 the course was substantially revised, a number of well liked stages from previous years are now used (Riana), and a number of all new stages were introduced (Mt Claude and Rossarden). Leg 3 was dropped by shortening the Leg 2 East Coast day ending back in Launceston (rather than Hobart). Leg 3 is another loop north out of Launceston (running through Devonport on this day). Leg 4 now runs from Launceston through the lunch stop at Burnie to the evening end at Strahan. It remains the longest tarmac rally in Australia with no repeated stages. Although a couple of stages will share the same piece of road in opposite directions on consecutive days. The Targa is one of several Tarmac Rally events to be held in Australia. It also has had international connections with Targa New Zealand and Targa Newfoundland which have evolved since the inception of Targa Tasmania. ==List of past winners== In 2016 the premier category changed from Modern to Showroom GT2. ===Showroom GT4 Competition=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" !
