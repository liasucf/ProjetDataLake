He has had two No. 1 Billboard Gospel Albums since with Life Music: Stage Two (2015) and Make Room (2018), eight Stellar Awards, a GMA Dove Award and three Grammy Award nominations. ==Early life== McReynolds was born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 17, 1989, as Jonathan Caleb McReynolds. Work ID No. 883470768 He was raised by a single mother with love and support from his family, church members and his pastor at New Original Church of God in Christ. Known to be a very precocious kid, he learned to play the drums at five years old, the piano at eight, and showcased his talents weekly as a church musician. He was a reluctant singer, to say the least. However, in high school, he began to break out of his shell; eventually, sharing his talents with the public rather than singing alone in his living room. He attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, where not only did he become known for his musical talents, but also learned how to record and produce music, as a member of the school's podcast initiative. Those skills would prove to be significant in college as he recorded his first songs including his first viral hit \"No Gray\" in his dorm room. ==Music career== His music career was started in 2012, with the release of Life Music on September 25, 2012, by Light Records and Entertainment One Music. This was his breakthrough released on the Billboard charts, and it placed at No. 98 on Billboard 200 along with Gospel Albums at No. 3, and at No. 23 on the Independent Albums chart. His song \"No Gray\" was a viral smash that earned him TV appearances on BET's Celebration of Gospel and fans in India Arie and Nicki Minaj. McReynolds's second album Life Music: Stage Two was Grammy Award nominated, a Billboard Gospel No. 1 album for four weeks, and a GMA Dove Award winner. It featured Israel Houghton, India.Arie and Chantae Cann and his first top five gospel hit \"Gotta Have You.\" Rating the album five stars for Journal of Gospel Music, Bob Marovich says, \"Life Music, Stage Two is the musical manifestation of his honest and spiritually grounded approach to dealing with the vicissitudes of daily life.\"Marovich, Bob (September 18, 2015). \"Jonathan McReynolds \u2013 Life Music: Stage Two\".

Make Room touted his first No. 1 radio hit \"Not Lucky, I'm Loved\" and the huge viral smash \"Cycles.\" This album garnered public support from stars of different cultures and genres like Justin Bieber, Kandi Burruss, and millions of listeners around the world.

He was also the first in his genre to form a major partnership with Tidal.
