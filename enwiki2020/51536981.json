    "text": "Hello Destroyer is a 2016 Canadian drama film directed by Kevan Funk. It had its world premiere in the Discovery section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film stars Jared Abrahamson as an enforcer on a hockey team who faces difficult consequences when a hit on an opposing player during a game turns more violent than intended. It was nominated for four Canadian Screen Awards, including Best Motion Picture. ==Cast== * Jared Abrahamson as Tyson Burr * Kurt Max Runte as Coach Dale Milbury * Joe Buffalo as Eric * Paul McGillion as Ron Burr * Sara Canning as Wendy Davis ==Production== According to Funk, his intention was to make a film that explored institutional and systemic violence rather than a sports film per se; he chose a hockey-related setting as it represented an \"aggressively Canadian\" cultural institution which has a complex relationship with violence and toxic masculinity, and has stated that if he were making the same film in the United States he would likely have chosen a military setting. The film was shot primarily in Prince George, British Columbia, including at the CN Centre. ==Reception== Vice Sports describes the film as \"about how violence is cultivated, showcased and then punished within a set of institutions that require its presence to be profitable\", and Alex Rose of the magazine Cult MTL called the film \"as Canadian as a Weakerthans song and as depressing as that second Leonard Cohen record.\"\"Hot new films from day four of TIFF\". Cult MTL, 12 September 2016. On 7 December 2016, the film was named to the Toronto International Film Festival's annual Canada's Top 10 list. ===Accolades=== The film received four Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor (Abrahamson). {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"|Awards ! scope=\"col\"|Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"|Category ! scope=\"col\"|Recipients and nominees ! scope=\"col\"|Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- |rowspan=4|Canadian Screen Awards |rowspan=4|12 March 2017 | Best Motion Picture | Daniel Domachowski, Haydn Wazelle | |rowspan=4| |- | Best Director | Kevan Funk | |- | Best Actor | Jared Abrahamson | |- | Best Original Screenplay | Kevan Funk | |- | rowspan=7|Leo Awards | rowspan=7|2017 | Best Motion Picture | Haydn Wazelle, Daniel Domachowski | | rowspan=7| |- | Best Direction in a Motion Picture | rowspan=2| Kevan Funk | |- | Best Screenwriting in a Motion Picture | |- | Best Cinematography in a Motion Picture | Benjamin Loeb | |- | rowspan=2| Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Motion Picture | Kurt Max Runte | |- | Joe Buffalo | |- | Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Motion Picture | Jared Abrahamson | |- |rowspan=5|Vancouver Film Critics Circle |rowspan=5|16 December 2016 | Best Canadian Film | rowspan=3|Kevan Funk | |rowspan=5| |- | Best British Columbia Film | |- | Best Canadian Director | |- | Best Actor in a Canadian Film | Jared Abrahamson | |- | Best Supporting Actor in a Canadian Film | Kurt Max Runte | |- |rowspan=1|Vancouver International Film Festival |rowspan=1|2016 | BC Emerging Filmmaker Award | Kevan Funk | | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2016 films Category:2016 drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Films set in British Columbia Category:Films shot in British Columbia Category:English-language films Category:Canadian ice hockey films ",
