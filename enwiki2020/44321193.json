Opened in 1980, the station reflects the 'richer' period of the MIVA - the Antwerp transport company which was later merged into De Lijn - and is decorated in marble. The lay-out consists of three levels, of which the first (-1) contains a ticket hall and four exits towards street level (corresponding to the intersection under which it lies). Level -2 comprises the platform serving northbound trains to Diamant, whilst Level -3 comprises the southbound platform towards the premetro tunnel exits at the Belgielei, used by routes 2,6 and 15, and Mercatorstraat, used by route 9. ==See also== * Trams in Antwerp Category:Antwerp Premetro Category:Railway stations opened in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in Belgium ",
