She continues \"The least successful stories are a sequence about middle-class dinner parties, rendered largely in dialogue....Still, there's no shortage of that elsewhere in this collection, which combines mordant humour, perspicacity and invigoratingly crisp writing\".\"The spectre of mortality looms over this collection, but its characters are resolved to put up a fight\", The Independent, 9th Jan 2011 Retrieved 2016-07-31. *Michiko Kakutani writing in The New York Times also feels the collection is patchy: \"Mr. Barnes\u2019s latest collection, \u201cPulse,\u201d is filled with both gems and should-have-been discards. The title story and \u201cMarriage Lines\u201d are beautiful, elegiac tales about how marriages endure or change over time: stories that attest to the new emotional depth Mr. Barnes discovered in his 2004 collection \u201cThe Lemon Table.\u201d Unfortunately, many other entries in this volume are brittle exercises in craft: a writer writing on automatic pilot, substituting verbal facility for genuine humor or real feeling, a scattering of social details for a persuasive sense of time and place.\"Love, Loss, Change and Being English, The New York Times, 5th May 2011 Retrieved 5th May 2011. == References == == External links == * *Rachel Cusk praises the compassion and truth of Julian Barnes's painstaking short stories, The Guardian, 8th Jan 2011 *\"Julian Barnes on Not Talking About Love\", Sunday Book Review by Christopher Benfey, The New York Times, May 20th 2011 Category:2011 short story collections Category:Single-writer short story collections Category:British short story collections Category:Jonathan Cape books ",
