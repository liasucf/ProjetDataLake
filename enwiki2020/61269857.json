The Ragin' Cajuns, led by first-year head coach Bob Marlin, played their home games at the Cajundome and were members of the West Division of the Sun Belt Conference. They finished the season 13\u201317, 10\u20138 in Sun Belt play to finish in a two-way tie for third place in the standings. They competed in the 2010 Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament where they lost in the Quarterfinals to Louisiana\u2013Monroe. They were not invited to any other post-season tournament. Immediately following the loss in the conference tournament, the university announced that Robert Lee's contract had not been renewed. Lee's overall cumulative record was 80\u2013100 at Louisiana\u2013Lafayette, which would be highlighted by the best single-season record at 15\u201315 despite the 2004\u201305 record of 20\u201311 along with a Sun Belt Tournament championship and an NCAA Tournament appearance, which were all vacated due to academic ineligibility of Orien Greene. ==Roster== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- !colspan=7 style= |2009\u201310 Louisiana\u2013Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns Men's Basketball Roster |- |Number |Name |Position |Height |Weight |Year |Hometown |- | 0 | Colby Baptiste | Forward | 6\u20139 | 220 | Junior | Lafayette, Louisiana |- | 1 | Tyren Johnson | Forward | 6\u20138 | 204 | Senior | Edgard, Louisiana |- | 2 | Randell Daigle | Guard | 5\u201310 | 183 | Senior | Lafayette, Louisiana |- | 3 | Travis Bureau | Guard | 6\u20137 | 191 | Junior | St. Amant, Louisiana |- | 4 | Phillip Jones | Guard | 6\u20130 | 185 | Sophomore | Maurice, Louisiana |- | 4 | Lamar Roberson | Forward | 6\u20138 | 190 | Senior | Baton Rouge, Louisiana |- | 5 | Brandon Dison | Guard | 6\u20135 | 171 | Senior | Westfield, Texas |- | 11 | Corey Bloom | Guard | 6\u20135 | 215 | Senior | New Orleans, Louisiana |- | 12 | Willie Lago | Guard | 6\u20131 | 186 | Senior | Reserve, Louisiana |- | 20 | Courtney Wallace | Forward/Center | 6\u20138 | 238 | Senior | Baton Rouge, Louisiana |- | 21 | Ryan McCoy | Guard | 6\u20130 | 167 | Senior | Houston, Texas |- | 22 | Raymone Andrews | Guard | 6\u20132 | 171 | Redshirt Freshman | Hammond, Louisiana |- | 23 | La'Ryan Gary | Guard/Forward | 6\u20137 | 230 | Senior | Carencro, Louisiana |- | 31 | Robert Vaughn | Guard | 5\u201311 | 165 | Redshirt Freshman | Grand Isle, Louisiana |- | 33 | Chris Gradnigo | Guard | 6\u20137 | 281 | Junior | Lake Charles, Louisiana |- | 44 | Javan Mitchell | Forward | 6\u20139 | 248 | Redshirt Freshman | Greensboro, North Carolina |- |} ==Schedule== |- !colspan=9 style=| Regular Season |- !colspan=9 style=| 2010 Sun Belt Conference Men's Basketball Tournament https://ragincajuns.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=53 ==References== Category:Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball seasons Louisiana-Lafayette Louisiana Louisiana ",
