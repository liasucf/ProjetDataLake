Moonstone is the first US publisher to produce new Phantom stories for the comic book format since Marvel Comics cancelled their Phantom 2040 comic in 1995. Moonstone started publishing Phantom graphic novels in 2002. Only five books, written by Tom DeFalco, Ben Raab and Ron Goulart, were published, but in 2003, Moonstone started a regular comic book series with the character, written by Ben Raab, Rafael Nieves, and Chuck Dixon, and drawn by the likes of Pat Quinn, Jerry DeCaire, Nick Derington, Rich Burchett and EricJ. After 11 issues, Mike Bullock took over the book, with Carlos Magno as the regular artist in 2006, leaving the series to finally come out on a more regular schedule. Moonstone have also made and is in the process of making several special projects with the character. In 2006, a retcon of the Phantom's origin called \"Legacy\" was published, written by Ben Raab and drawn by Pat Quinn, which aimed to look like one of the Phantom's chronicle books. 2006 also marked the year when Moonstone invented the wide-vision format, introducing it to the world with the Phantom story \"Law of the Jungle\". Moonstone have also announced a Phantom Annual, and two prose collections featuring Phantom short stories. The Phantom is Moonstone's best selling title. ===Moonstone Noir=== In January 2002, Moonstone Books announced their plans to develop the radio drama Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar as a quarterly book in their Noir Fiction line. This was to be the first graphic novel in the series. It was one of their more faithful and entertaining adaptations of a classic noir character. There is no record of the series continuing. The creative team consisted of David Gallaher, a former Marvel.com writer/editor, and Eric Theriault, the creator of such cult faves as Veena and Flirt. ===Moonstone Monsters=== ===Kolchak the Night Stalker=== Moonstone is publishing new stories based on the TV-series Kolchak: The Night Stalker. Several graphic novels featuring the character have been published, as well as a regular, ongoing comic book series. A \"wide vision\" graphic novel has been announced. ===Buckaroo Banzai=== Since 2006, Moonstone have been publishing comics with Buckaroo Banzai, the main character from the 1984 cult film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, which continues plotlines left unexplored in the movie. ===Prose anthologies=== Moonstone recently published a Stoker Award-nominated prose anthology with Kolchak, which sold out fast.
