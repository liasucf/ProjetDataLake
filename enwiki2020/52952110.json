    "text": "The 2017 Girabola is the 39th season of top-tier football in Angola. The season ran from 10 February to 5 November 2017. The league comprised 16 teams, the bottom three of which will be relegated to the 2018 Provincial stages. ==Teams== A total of 16 teams will contest the league, including 13 sides from the 2016 season and three promoted from the 2016 Segundona - Bravos do Maquis, J.G.M. and Santa Rita de C\u00e1ssia. On the other hand, 4 de Abril do K.K., Porcelana F.C. and Primeiro de Maio were the last three teams of the 2016 season and will play in the Segundona for the 2018 season. Clube Desportivo Primeiro de Agosto are the defending champions from the 2016 season. On January 23, 2017, Benfica de Luanda issued a press release stating that it would no longer participate in the Girabola, with effect from 2017 and until further notice, citing financial reasons, and that the club would focus on its youth academy and in turning the club into a sports company. With such decision, the club is liable to a heavy penalty by the Angolan Federation that might include a ban to participate in the girabola for an established period For the repechage to fill the spot of Benfica de Luanda, a round-robin qualifier tournament was announced to be contested by the three relegated teams in the 2016 Girabola plus the two top-ranked teams in the 2016 Segundona. As four of the five invited teams declined to participate on financial grounds, Primeiro de Maio was selected to replace Benfica de Luanda. ==Est\u00e1dio 4 de Janeiro disaster== On February 10, 2017, during the inaugural match between home team Santa Rita de C\u00e1ssia and Recreativo do Libolo, one of the access gates of Est\u00e1dio 4 de Janeiro collapsed as supporters tried to force their way into the stadium. As a result, 17 people were trampled to death and 76 injured, 5 of whom with life-threatening injuries. The incident began just about 6 minutes from the beginning of the match with the match pursuing its normal course until the end and no one inside the stadium realizing what was going on. The Police has reportedly used tear gas to disperse angry supporters. ==Changes from 2016 season== Relegated: 4 de Abril do Cuando, Porcelana, 1\u00ba de Maio Promoted: Bravos do Maquis, Desportivo JGM, Santa Rita de C\u00e1ssia Withdrew: Benfica de Luanda Nominated: 1\u00ba de Maio ==Progresso da Lunda Sul relegation== Progresso da Lunda Sul was relegated for fielding an ineligible player on its 29th round match against Acad\u00e9mica do Lobito. As the club was struggling with financial trouble, they had initially been awarded a 3-0 defeat in their round 20 home match against Progresso do Sambizanga. ===Stadiums and locations=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
