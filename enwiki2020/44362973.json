The film also depicts the Battle of Chamkaur which took place in December, 1704 CE in which 42 Sikhs (under Guru Gobind singh) fought bravely against 10 lakh mughal forces (under wazir Khan). In the battle of Chamkaur, both the elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Sahibzada Ajit Singh 18 years old and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh 14 years old were martyred. The Mughals were in large number but still they failed to capture Guru Gobind Singh and hence Sikhs defeated Mughals. The Younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh Sahibzada Zorawar Singh who was 9 years old and Sahibzada Fateh Singh who was 7 years old were taken to Wazir Khan's palace and were cruelly and inhumanely executed by the Mughal ruler of Sirhind. Wazir Khan gave orders that masons were to brick the Gurus two youngest sons into a section of the city's wall.http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sahibzada_Fateh_Singh == Cast == * Om Puri as the Narrator == Production == Pammi Baweja produced the film under the banner of Baweja movies.
