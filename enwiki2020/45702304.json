It was renamed Esmond in 1884, some say, after the novel The History of Henry Esmond by William Makepeace Thackeray. Others believe the community was named after Esmond, Illinois, the native home of a first settler. A post office was established as Sana in 1883, renamed Esmond in 1884, and the post office closed in 1973. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Kingsbury County, South Dakota Category:Unincorporated communities in South Dakota Category:1883 establishments in Dakota Territory ",
