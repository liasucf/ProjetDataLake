It is on the Leichhardt Highway about halfway between Taroom and Miles and is the centre for the local cattle industry. In the , Wandoan had a population of 566 people. ==History== War memorial, Wandoan, 2014 The beginnings of the Wandoan township can be traced back to 1853 when 'Juandah' Station was established at this location in 1849. When Herbert Salway and Percival Sydney Francis Stephen first tendered for a huge area of land: Juandah of and two other runs Coringa of and Cherwondah of . This area, defined in accordance with the 1847 Orders-in-Council, falls far short of the actual size of the holding, which has been estimated at \u2014five and a half times as much. The aggregation of these three runs became known as Juandah and records show Percival Stephen was living on Juandah before August 1849. After the Hornet Bank massacre in October 1857, one of the many reprisals against Aboriginal people in the area included the Juandah massacre. Frederick Walker wrote to the Colonial Secretary of Queensland describing how after a number of aboriginals were declared innocent of involvement at Hornet Bank by a bench of magistrates at Juandah, local whites proceeded to murder them. Some were shot on the verandah of the magistrate's residence and others in the kitchen. Two aboriginals were kept alive in order to bury the corpses and once this was done, one of them was shot and the other was spared as \"possibly the supply of cartridges was running short\". A wayside hotel was built there in the 1890s, and by the end of the nineteenth century the hotel was well established and a township was formed. Juandah Provisional School opened on 30 October 1911. It became a State School on 1 March 1916. Due to low student numbers, it closed in 1922 but reopened in 1923. In 1924, it was renamed Wandoan State School in 1924. A secondary department was added in 1961. The railway to Miles opened on 16 December 1914. Juandah was named Wandoan in 1926 to avoid confusion with Jundah near Longreach. After World War II, land around Wandoan was used for soldier settlements through ballots in the 1950s. The Wandoan Library opened in 1987. The Wandoan War Memorial is in front of the Community Culture Centre on Henderson Street and commemorates Australians who served in all wars. There are plaques for individual wars on the wall behind the memorial. The monument was dedicated on 25 April (Anzac Day) 1993. ==Economy== The town's economy is traditionally based on agriculture, including wheat, sorgum and cattle.
