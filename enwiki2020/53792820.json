An official band statement claimed them to be \"the darkest and scariest black metal band to ever set foot on planet earth\".https://www.facebook.com/pg/slagmaurofficial/about/?ref=page_internal The band is quite secretive and little is known about the band members, although it is known that Mehimoloth from Celestial Bloodshed was a member of the band until his death in 2009.http://www.metal- archives.com/bands/Slagmaur/73422 They have described their sound as \"twisted and sinister Black Metal, multi layered and complex\".https://www.facebook.com/pg/slagmaurofficial/about/?ref=page_internal The band have also attracted interest for their conceptualized, unusual imagery and live shows which display a theatrical horror aesthetic and bizarre live antics. Their set at the 2017 edition of the Inferno festival, which quickly generated controversy, featured staged executions by hanging as well as a model/stuntman tied to an upsidedown cross which was set on fire at the end of the show, while band members \"prowled around the stage, looking genuinely psychotic and to be gaining pleasure from the on-stage executions\".https://artistpicturesblog.com/2017/04/16/the-inferno-metal- festival-2017-saturday-with-belphegor-primordial-abbath-and-slagmaur/ The concert reportedly induced strong discomfort among the audiencehttps://artistpicturesblog.com/2017/04/16/the-inferno-metal- festival-2017-saturday-with-belphegor-primordial-abbath-and- slagmaur/http://www.avenoctum.com/2017/04/inferno-festival-oslo- norway-12-15th-april-2017-day-4/ and has been described as \"one of the most extreme live acts ever performed\", with renowned heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer reporting \"It's not easy to shock in black metal today, but Slagmaur did it\".https://www.facebook.com/slagmaurofficial/photos/a.10151221776791130.449446.152465176129/10154915637936130/?type=3http://www.metalhammer.no/?p=8968 == Personnel == ===Current line up=== * Lt.
