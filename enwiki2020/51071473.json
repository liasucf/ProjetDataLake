    "text": "Smyrna High School is a 9\u201312 public high school in Smyrna, Delaware. ==History== The school graduated its first class in 1894. Until the mid-1990s Smyrna was considered a farm community with a small rural school. The town has experienced a wave of economic expansion since then. As of 2017, the Smyrna School District had doubled in population, and as a result Smyrna High School had become Delaware's eighth largest high school, with a greatly expanded academic curriculum and facilities.Cris Barrish, \"Rise of a Delaware town \u2014 unified by its high school football team\", WHYY-TV, October 4, 2017. ==Campus== The school moved to its current campus in 1970. The campus underwent a $61 million renovation in 2006. ==Accreditation== The school was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1931. ==Program== The school has a program for students considering a career in education. ==Athletics== Smyrna High School competes in the Henlopen Conference of the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (DIAA), with 42 teams in 23 sports. The boys' school athletics program had historically been known mainly for its wrestling program, but Smyrna's population growth brought greater success in football and other sports. A dramatic last-second defensive stop gave Smyrna the 2015 Division 1 state football championship in an upset win over Wilmington's perennial state power Salesianum School; Symrna followed up the next year with state championships in football and boys' basketball. ===State championships=== * Softball: 1993, 2018 * Track and Field: **Boys Outdoor Division II: 1990, 1991 **Girls Outdoor Division I: 2013 * Football: 2015, 2016, 2017 * Basketball (boys): 2017 * Dual Team Wrestling: ** Division II: 1993, 1995, 1996, 2003, 2005 ** Division I: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 ==References== ==External links== * Category:High schools in Kent County, Delaware ",
