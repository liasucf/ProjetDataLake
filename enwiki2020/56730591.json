The painting depicts Obama sitting in a chair seemingly floating among foliage. The foliage is described by the author as \"chrysanthemums (the official flower of Chicago), jasmine (symbolic of Hawaii where the president spent most of his childhood) and African blue lilies (alluding to the president's late Kenyan father).\" Reacting to the unveiling of his portrait Obama said: \"How about that? That's pretty sharp\". The Washington Post described the painting as \"not what you'd expect and that's why it's great\". Together with Amy Sherald's portrait of Michelle Obama, the paintings were unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery on February 12, 2018. Both portraits mark the first time two African-American artists were commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery. == Reception == The unveiling of the portrait led to thousands of visitors lining up at the entrance, and a threefold increase in visitors compared to the prior President's Day Weekend. At the unveiling, Obama appreciated Wiley\u2019s ability to show \u201cthe beauty and the grace and the dignity\u201d of Black people in a grand way. Obama commended the painting for avoiding making him \u201clook like Napoleon\u201d as many of Wiley\u2019s previous subjects were on horseback. National Gallery Director Kim Sajet supported both the selection and the artist\u2019s rendition, commending Wiley on his ability to integrate popular culture into the realm of high art. Online media outlets had mixed reactions to the painting. Some see the portraits as political and historical commentary; elegant as an attempt to subvert the racist insults experienced by Obama during his presidency but vibrant enough to entice the viewer. The Obama portrait may also uphold the public image of the man himself as an intelligent, serious problem solver. The public response on social media ranged from likening it to simplistic art, to humorous reflections on the portrait in the form of memes, featuring cartoon character Homer Simpson and using wordplay to comment on the use of bushes in the portrait. ==See also== * Portraits of Presidents of the United States ==References== Category:2018 paintings Category:21st-century portraits Category:Black people in art Category:Cultural depictions of Barack Obama Category:Paintings in the National Portrait Gallery (United States) Category:Portraits by American artists Category:Portraits of men Category:Portraits of politicians ",
