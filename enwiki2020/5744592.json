    "text": "South Dock was a railway station on the Isle of Dogs in east London. It was between Millwall Junction and Millwall Docks on the Millwall Extension Railway (MER) branch of the London and Blackwall Railway (LBR) which opened to goods traffic on 18 December 1871 and to passenger services on 29 July 1872.London's Lost Railways, C Klapper, 1976, Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. The station was on the northern side of the South Dock of the West India Docks, near the eastern end. It had an island platform as it was the only passing loop on the branch.The Forgotten Stations of Greater London, J.Connor and B.Halford , The station buildings were of timber with a slate roof. Platform was brick faced. Station was staffed entirely by dock employees, company issued its own tickets.Disused Stations: South Dock Station The station was renamed South West India Dock in July 1881 but reverted to its original name of South Dock in May 1895. It stood in a relatively isolated location in the docks area, some distance from the nearest road. Passenger usage of the station was always light and services to it, and the rest of the MER extension, ceased in May 1926, though goods services continued until the demise of the docks in the 1970s. Extensive rebuilding in the 1980s Docklands redevelopment has left no trace of the station or the line (the Docklands Light Railway reuses much of the LBR's route but runs further to the west in this area to serve Canary Wharf). Today the site is occupied by a BT telecommunications building. ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Former London and Blackwall Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1872 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1926 ",
