The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 3,900 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005. == History == Ottoman subdivisions when the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds came to Lebanon The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds who came to present day Lebanon were Iranians who came in the 1870s. The founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, was exiled to Acre, which was at the time was part of the same Ottoman province, or vilayet, of Beirut. In 1880, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's son \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, visited Beirut at the invitation of Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of the Syria Vilayet.Midhat Pasha and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in \u02bbAkka: The Historical Background of the Tablet of the Land of Ba, Necati Alkan, Baha\u02bci Studies Review, 2005 A Beirut newspaper described his visit by saying \"His Excellency, the learned, erudite, intelligent and illustrious \u02bbAbbas Effendi, resident of the city of \u02bbAkka, has arrived in our city\". Following the visit Baha'u'llah wrote the \"Tablet of the Land of Ba (Beirut)\", later described as a \"glowing tribute\" to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. During his visits to Beirut, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 also met Muhammad Abduh, one of the key figures of Islamic Modernism and the Salafi movement, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman ulama and shared similar goals of religious reform. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 would attend Abduh's study sessions. Regarding the meetings of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Muhammad \u02bbAbduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that \"His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad \u02bbAbdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.\" In 1894 a Lebanese Christian, Ibrahim George Kheiralla, converted to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith whilst traveling in Cairo. After Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote a specific tablet to him, he moved to Chicago in the United States and was instrumental in converting many of the early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed followers there.God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi, 1944 Two Beirut universities - the American University of Beirut and the Saint Joseph University - had significant Baha'i student populations in the early twentieth century. The first Baha'i student was recorded in the 1890s, the \u201cSociety of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Students of Beirut\" was formed in 1906 and by 1929 there were over 60 Baha'i students from Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Palestine. The university promoted \"internationalism\" as a core value and acknowledged the Baha'i students as a significant contribution to this vision. The Baha'i leader, Shoghi Effendi, studied at the American University of Beirut, graduating in 1917.Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Students and American University of Beirut in the Early 20th Century, Reed M. Breneman, 2008 A Shi\u02bbite Imam in the southern village of Machgara, Sheikh Ja\u02bcafar Al-Tahhan, converted to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1923, and that village is now the centre of the community, with the only Lebanese local Spiritual Assembly. The Encyclopedia of the Orient reported that there were 4,000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds living in Lebanon, or around 0.13% of the population.Lebanon: Situation of Baha'is, Government of Canada, 2004-04-16 In 1968, a prominent Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed academic, Suheil Bushrui became a visiting professor at the American University of Beirut. In the 1980s he was appointed an advisor by President Amine Gemayel, indicating how Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are accepted. Bushrui is noted scholar on Khalil Gibran, having published more than one volume about him and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland.Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet: Why is it so loved?, BBC News, 12 May 2012, accessed 12 May 2012The Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the Center for Heritage Resource Studies The University of Maryland == Treatment == The Baha'i Faith is not one of the 18 recognised sects in Lebanon, so many Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are officially listed according to the religion of their ancestors, mostly Shiite. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed marriages are therefore not recognised, so Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds tend to travel to Cyprus to have a civil wedding, which is recognised when they return. Other than that, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are allowed to practice their religion in public without any problems. == References == == Further reading == * Related documents and timeline on Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Library Online == See also == * Khalil Gibran who knew \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, head of the religion in his lifetime. * History of Lebanon * Religion in Lebanon Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the Arab world Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Asia Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the Middle East Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith by country Category:Religion in Lebanon ",
