Main Street of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Airport. View of the island from the sea. Le\u00f3n Dormido (in English : Kicker Rock). San Crist\u00f3bal (Chatham) is the easternmost island in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, as well as one of the oldest geologically. It is administratively part of San Crist\u00f3bal Canton, Ecuador. Its Spanish (and official Ecuadorian) name \"San Crist\u00f3bal\" comes from the patron saint of seafarers, St. Christopher. English speakers increasingly use that name in preference to the traditional English name of Chatham Island, derived from William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. ==History== San Cristobal Island is composed of three or four fused volcanoes, all extinct. It is home to the oldest permanent settlement of the islands and is the island where Darwin first went ashore in 1835. A small lake called El Junco is the only source of fresh water in the islands. The availability of fresh water is what led to the early settlement of San Cristobal. A penal colony was built on San Crist\u00f3bal Island in 1880 for prisoners from mainland Ecuador. This later turned into a military base for Ecuador and export center for the island's products including sugar, coffee, cassava, cattle, fish and lime. In April 1888 , a Navy-manned research vessel assigned to the United States Fish Commission, made landfall at an abandoned settlement on Charles Island. ==Geography== San Crist\u00f3bal has an area of and its highest point rises to . The population is approximately 6000. San Crist\u00f3bal is the most fertile island of the archipelago and is the second most populated after Santa Cruz. The capital of the archipelago, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, lies at the south-western tip of the island. ==Air transport== The island is served by San Crist\u00f3bal Airport, with daily flights from Quito and Guayaquil. ==Ecology== This island hosts frigatebirds, Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions, Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises, blue and red footed boobies, tropicbirds, marine iguanas, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls. Its vegetation includes Calandrinia galapagosa, Lecocarpus darwinii, trees such as Lignum vitae, Matazarna. In the waters nearby are sharks, rays, and lobsters. The largest fresh water lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in a crater in the highlands of San Crist\u00f3bal, in the southern half of the island. The lake harbors a large population of birdlife, but reaching the lake requires a short uphill walk. Nearby, La Galapaguera is a breeding station and sanctuary for giant tortoises. ==Economy== Most inhabitants of San Crist\u00f3bal Island make their living in government, tourism, and fishing. The majority of the residents of San Crist\u00f3bal live in the port city of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, which is the capital of Ecuador\u2032s Gal\u00e1pagos Province. Island tourism sites nearer the town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno include the Cerro Tijeretas, a nesting colony for frigate birds, and a statue of Charles Darwin, marking the original site where he first disembarked in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle on 16 September 1835.Keynes, R. D. ed. 2001, Charles Darwin's Beagle Diary, p. 351. La Loberia, a colony of sea lions, lies about ten minutes by bus from the town. Local boat tours also take visitors to two popular nearby dive sites. \"Kicker Rock\" (the Spanish name is \"Le\u00f3n Dormido\") is the remains of a lava cone, now split in two. Isla Lobos (\"Sea Lion Island\") is also a nesting site for blue- footed boobies. ==Fauna== Paisaje en Cerro Brujo, isla de San Crist\u00f3bal, islas Gal\u00e1pagos, Ecuador, 2015-07-24, DD 115.JPG|Beach in Cerro Brujo, San Crist\u00f3bal Island.
