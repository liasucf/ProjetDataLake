    "text": "The European walking route E1 The E1 European long-distance path, or just E1 path, is one of the European long-distance paths designated by the European Ramblers' Association. It has a total length of some . It begins in Norway at Nordkapp, and crosses the Kattegat between Sweden and Denmark by ferry. It passes through Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland to finish at Scapoli, Italy. This path was extended southwards to Sicily, in Italy in 2018. Specific E1 waymarks are only seen in some locations such as at border crossings or at intersections with other paths, instead the signs and markings of the local routes which make up the E1 are used. The path is described here in a north to south direction, although it is waymarked in both directions. ==Norway== During 2010\u20132011, the Norwegian Trekking Association created a marked hiking trail from Nordkapp to Kautokeino. Also following the Nordkalottleden Trail and Grenses\u00f8mmen, this extended the E1 all the way to the North Cape. The Nordkalottleden Trail (Kautokeino-Treriksr\u00f8ysa-Abisko-Sulitjelma) and Grenses\u00f8mmen (Sulitjelma-R\u00f8ssvatnet-B\u00f8rgefjell-Gress\u00e5moen-Sylan-Gr\u00f6velsj\u00f6n) cross the Norwegian-Finnish and Norwegian-Swedish border several times. The route between Nordkapp and Gr\u00f6velsj\u00f6n does in part go in very remote areas with very few shelters and very little service available. Parts of the path are unmarked so that the hikers need to find their own route. ===Norwegian kick-off=== On June 4, 2013, Innovasjon Norge and Norwegian Trekking Association marked the Norwegian part of the path officially opened. The path stretches 2.105 km, and holds 60.000 waymarks on either cairns or tree stems all the way, except through B\u00f8rgefjell National Park; regulations for B\u00f8rgefjell National Park prohibits waymarks. The B\u00f8rgefjell section is only marked on maps. This is also valid for the next section; from the southern tip of B\u00f8rgefjell National Park in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag to S\u00e6tertj\u00f8nnhytta in Steinkjer there are no waymarks by the desire of the Sami people and other considerations. ===Route=== ====Parts marked with cairns==== Nordkapp \u2192 North Cape Tunnel North Cape Tunnel \u2192 Stabbursdalen National Park Stabbursdalen National Park \u2192 Masi Masi \u2192 Kautokeino Kautokeino \u2192 Reisa National Park Reisa National Park \u2192 K\u00e4sivarsi Wilderness Area (Finland) K\u00e4sivarsi Wilderness Area (Finland) \u2192 Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (Finland) Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (Finland) \u2192 Malla Strict Nature Reserve (Finland) Malla Strict Nature Reserve (Finland) \u2192 Goldahytta near Treriksr\u00f8ysa (Sweden, Finland, Norway) Goldahytta near Treriksr\u00f8ysa (Sweden, Finland, Norway) \u2192 \u00d8vre Dividal National Park \u00d8vre Dividal National Park \u2192 Altevatnet Altevatnet \u2192 Tornetr\u00e4sk (Sweden) Tornetr\u00e4sk (Sweden) \u2192 Narvikfjellene Narvikfjellene \u2192 Tysfjord Tysfjord \u2192 Stora Sj\u00f6fallet National Park (Sweden) Stora Sj\u00f6fallet National Park (Sweden) \u2192 Padjelanta National Park (Sweden) Padjelanta National Park (Sweden) \u2192 Junkerdal National Park Junkerdal National Park \u2192 Saltfjellet\u2013Svartisen National Park Saltfjellet\u2013Svartisen National Park \u2192 Okstindan Okstindan \u2192 B\u00f8rgefjell National Park ====Parts only marked on the map==== The path goes through B\u00f8rgefjell National Park and then, from the southern tip of B\u00f8rgefjell National Park, in R\u00f8yrvik, Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag continues through R\u00f8yrvik, over Steinfjellet in Namsskogan and back into R\u00f8yrvik. The path continues along Tunnsj\u00f8en to Skorovatn in Namsskogan again, over Gruvefjellet to Midtre Nes\u00e5vatnet, and then under Nes\u00e5piggen in R\u00f8yrvik again. Then, it continues to Skjelbredtunet in Lierne and over Bl\u00e5fjella\u2013Skj\u00e6kerfjella National Park to the bordelake Holderen in Sn\u00e5sa. Gaundalen airport over Skj\u00e6kerfjella to S\u00e6tertj\u00f8nnhytta in Steinkjer by the lake Sk\u00e6hkerenjaevrie, close to the geographical centre of Norway there are no hallmarks by wish of Sami people and other considerations. ==Sweden== \u00d6sterdal\u00e4lven river near Gagnef Responsible organisation: Svenska Turistf\u00f6reningen ===Route=== The path starts at Gr\u00f6velsj\u00f6n (Lake Gr\u00f6vel), which lies near the Norwegian-Swedish border near Idre. It uses a series of connecting established paths down to Varberg, a city on the coast south of G\u00f6teborg, from where the ferry to Denmark sails. From its start it follows Vasaloppsleden, Siljansleden, southern part of the Malingsbo-Kloten Rundan, Bergslagsleden, V\u00e4stra V\u00e4tterleden along the western edge of lake V\u00e4ttern, a short part of S\u00f6dra V\u00e4tterleden at Ulricehamn and a connecting trail to Sjuh\u00e4radsleden, then Knalleleden, Vildmarksleden and Bohusleden to G\u00f6teborg and Hallandsleden to Varberg. Total length of the path in Sweden: appr. 1200 km From the start at Gr\u00f6velsj\u00f6n other established walking paths go further north, for example reaching Hemavan where the well- known Kungsleden goes to Abisko in the far north Sweden. ===Practical=== The route consist mostly of narrow footpaths running through the forested hills of middle Sweden and avoids most population centers. There are not many shops along the route so it may be necessary to plan or go off-route for supplies. The paths are printed on the Swedish topographic maps so special maps or guidebooks are not necessary. Wild camping in Sweden is allowed. Alternatively there are many vindskydd along the route. These are simple three-sided log cabins with the open side facing a campfire. They are often in idyllic places and are free to use. ;External links * STF\u2014Svenska Turistf\u00f6reningen * Bergslagsleden\u2014Bergslagsleden website * E1 in Sweden (in Swedish) ==Denmark== Povl's Bridge from 1744 Responsible organisation: Dansk vandrelaug ===Route=== The ferry from Varberg in Sweden arrives in Gren\u00e5. The link from Gren\u00e5 to Vrads Sande on the H\u00e6rvej was inaugurated in 2006. The first part of this new stage is the Mols route to \u00c5rhus. Then it uses the \u00c5rhus \u2013 Silkeborg route via Skanderborg to Virklund and from Virklund to Vrads on the Horsens Silkeborg naturstien. At Vrads it connects to the historic H\u00e6rvej which is followed south to the German border. It meets up with the European walking route E6 near Padborg. From Bov a part of the Gendarmstien is used to link the H\u00e6rvejen to the German Ochsenweg. The border is crossed between Krus\u00e5 and Kupferm\u00fchle. The total length in Denmark is 325 km. ===Practical=== Camping in the wild is not allowed in Denmark. There are however primitive campsites (Danish: lejrplads) along the route which commonly have room to pitch a few tents, a water tap or pump, and a simple toilet, and they are often free to use. The route takes the walker along easy going paths and quiet roads through the rolling Danish landscape. It often visits larger towns so other forms of accommodation are possible and supplies are no problem. You can also use one of the many shelters, which are placed along the route. You may find them on Waymarkedtrails. ;External links *ERA E-path E1 in Denmark\u2014European Ramblers Association data on E1 in Denmark *Dansk vandrelaug\u2014Danish walking organisation *H\u00e6rvejen \u2013\u2013 website of the H\u00e6rvejen *Waymarkedtrails.org ==Germany== In Germany regional walking organisations are responsible for waymarking and maintaining the E1 in their area, with the Verband Deutscher Gebirgs- u. Wandervereine e. V. as umbrella organisation. Total length of the path in Germany: 1829.5 km ===Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg=== Responsible organisation: Wanderverband Norddeutschland On the first section the E1 European walking route runs together with the E6 route. The path crosses the border at Kupferm\u00fchle near Flensburg and leads through the towns of Flensburg and Schleswig. It touches the \"Naturpark H\u00fcttener Berge\" and runs parallel to the coast of the Baltic Sea until it reaches the city of Kiel. After Kiel it incorporates the towns of Preetz, Pl\u00f6n, Malente-Gremsm\u00fchlen, Eutin and Neustadt on its way to L\u00fcbeck. It goes on via Ratzeburg and M\u00f6lln until G\u00fcster \u2013 here the path of the E1 branches away from the E6. In Hamburg the route crosses the river Elbe. The Schlei \u2013 Eider \u2013 Elbe Wanderweg is known as the west alternative (Westvariant) of the E1 between Flensburg and Hamburg. It runs parallel to the North Sea coast and the Elbe instead of the Baltic.

The E1 is only rarely separately waymarked on these signposts, but the national routes which the E1 follows are generally marked. The route of the E1 leads from Konstanz to Wattwil, and then follows the Via Jacobi (part of St James's Way) to reach Lake Lucerne at Brunnen. From Brunnen it follows the shore of the lake to Fl\u00fcelen on the Swiss Path. From Fl\u00fcelen to the Italian border, the Trans-Swiss Trail is used, waymarked as Fernwanderweg 2. The path then climbs over the St. Gotthard Pass, the highest point of the path at 2091 m. After following the Strada alta Leventina through Ticino, the E1 reaches the border at Porto Ceresio, Italy. Total length of the route in Switzerland: 348 km. ;External links *Wandersite.ch Europ\u00e4ischer Fernwanderweg E1 durch die Schweiz (in German) ==Italy== Responsible organisation: Federazione Italiana Escursionismo Via Lake Maggiore into the Ligurian Mountains (there is a spur to the Mediterranean at Genova) to Passo della Bochetta.
