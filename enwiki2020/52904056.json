His name is listed on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. ==Family== Francis was the youngest of 13 children of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Antoinette Amalie (1696\u20131762); his sister Luise of Brunswick- Wolfenb\u00fcttel married Prince Augustus William of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great.Ferdinand Spehr, \u201eFriedrich Franz\u201c, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 7 (1878), S. 505, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, here.(Version vom 19 January 2017, 20:42 Uhr UTC) ==Death in battle== On 14 October 1758, the Austrians, commanded by Daun, surprised the Prussians with a pre-dawn assault on the sleeping camp. James Keith, Frederick's friend and an able general, had organized a defense of the village while Frederick could withdraw from Hochkirch.
