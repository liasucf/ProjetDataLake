After serving in the Home Guard during the Second World War, Hill became an amateur jockey in point-to-point racing. He went on to represent Britain in three-day eventing, winning a gold medal at the 1956 games in Stockholm along with a host of other international trophies. In the 1960s, Hill and his wife opened a riding school at Rapscott on Exmoor, training a number of future international riders including Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips. ==References== ==External links== * Obituary of Bertie Hill, Daily Telegraph Newspaper, 30 August 2005 Category:1927 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Olympic equestrians of Great Britain Category:British male equestrians Category:Equestrians at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medallists for Great Britain Category:British event riders Category:People educated at West Buckland School Category:Olympic medalists in equestrian Category:Medalists at the 1956 Summer Olympics ",
