In 104 BC, the eastern half of You Neishi was changed to Jingzhao Yin (\u4eac\u5146\u5c39, \"Intendant of the Capital\"), while the western half became You Fufeng. The region included 12 counties: Chang'an (), Xinfeng (), Chuansikong (), Lantian (), Huayin (), Zheng (), Hu (), Xiagui (), Nanling (), Fengming (), Baling () and Duling (). In 2 AD, the population was 682,468, in 195,702 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. By the end of the Han dynasty, Nanling, Fengming and Chuansikong counties were abolished and Hu and Huayin became part of Hongnong Commandery, while 5 new counties - Changling (), Yangling (), Shangluo (), Shang (), and Yinpan () - were added from other commanderies.Book of Later Han, Chapter 109. == Cao Wei to Sui dynasty == In the Cao Wei dynasty, Jingzhao became a regular commandery, and it governor was known as \"grand administrator\" ().Book of Jin, Chapter 14. In 583, the commandery was abolished. In 607, however, the commandery system was restored and Yong Prefecture () was renamed Jingzhao Commandery.Book of Sui, Chapter 30. == Tang dynasty and after == In Tang dynasty, Jingzhao was a superior prefecture () created in 713 AD by converting Yong Prefecture (). It lay north of the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi with Chang'an as its core. A census taken in 742 AD reported a total of 362,921 households (population: 1,960,188), while a census taken ca. 813 AD reported only 241,202 households. Chang'an was destroyed during the fall of Tang dynasty. However, the name \"Jingzhao\" was restored in the Later Tang dynasty. In Song dynasty, the prefecture administered 13 counties: Chang'an (), Fanchuan (), Hu (), Lantian (), Xianyang (), Jingyang (), Yueyang (), Gaoyang (), Xingping (), Lintong (), Liquan (), Wugong (), and Qianyou (). The name was used until Yuan dynasty when the prefecture became Anxi Circuit () and later Fengyuan Circuit (). In Ming dynasty, it adopted the current name Xi'an. ==References== Category:Prefectures of the Tang dynasty Category:713 establishments Category:States and territories established in the 710s Category:Commanderies of the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) Category:History of Xi'an Category:Commanderies of the Northern dynasties ",
