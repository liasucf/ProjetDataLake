    "text": "The International School of Choueifat (ISC) is a collection of private international schools run by SABIS school system in various countries of the Middle East. The first International School of Choueifat was founded in Choueifat, Lebanon in 1886 and later expanded to various parts of the Persian Gulf region. The first Choueifat school in the Persian Gulf opened in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates in 1975 and subsequently others opened in other cities across the Middle East. The school has built a tradition of placing students' acceptance letters from the college they attended in their foyers. The last day of secondary education is traditionally marked by Choueifat students on the last day of formal classes in the 12th grade. This last day of classes runs as any other day. There is also a tradition of the graduating class planting a tree on the campus grounds with an accompanying plaque, as their legacy to the school. Several such trees with accompanying plaques can be found on the grounds of every Choueifat school. ==Student Life Organization (SLO)== AKA SLO: This organization started as an attempt to have students basically run their school in areas such as academics, school trips, sports and \"discipline\". Unfortunately, withoutin some schools, lack of proper funding from the school's Board of Directors, considered to be stingy and unsympathetic to the student body, it has failed to achieve many of the goals it has set for itself. School trips to different locations around the cites they are located in are a rare treat, and the SLO has fallen back to organizing the inefficient system of make-up exams for the schools' Academic Monitoring System (A.M.S.). Not to render the SLO completely useless, it has shown certain advantages in an area the school defines as \"discipline\", where students take it upon themselves to enforce the rules and values the school has given itself. The schools have recently adopted a system dubbed \"Power Prefects\", where certain members of a classroom appointed to report any wrong- doings to the administration, such that their identities are kept secret, only known to the students chosen and certain members of the administration, namely the Director and Head of SLO. This system has only shown to spread discord between the student body, and since the system is only applied to students whose ages range from ten to eighteen years old, it ends up with more physical hurt to certain students than if the system were dropped altogether. The current SABIS education system is a fusion of the British GCSE and US High School systems. The first 9 years of students' schooling is typical prep- school education. Once in grade 10 (equivalent to grade 8 in some schools), students must choose between contingencies to either a Science (S) or Literary/Arts (L) section. In grades 10 and 11, students prepare for GCE/IGCSE O Level examinations, which are administered by the Edexcel International/London University Examinations and/or Cambridge International Examinations. Most of these tests are taken at the end of grade 11, even though select subjects might be accelerated and taken at the end of grade 10. After completing the British GCE exams, in grade 12, students again have a choice between Science and Literature. Moreover, in grade 12, they pursue studies to take the College Board Advanced Placement examinations at the end of grade 12 and earn their high school diplomas (a minimum grade of 50% in at least 5 subjects is required). Moreover, students may prepare to take their GCE Advanced Levels (A Levels) at the end of grade 13 (A level courses are two-year courses, grade 12 and 13). Depending on the courses a student takes and the university he or she wishes to apply to, they can generally be qualified with 12 or 13 years of schooling. == List of schools in the Middle East == * Choueifat, Lebanon * Sharjah, U.A.E. * Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. * Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. * Ajman, U.A.E. * Al Ain, U.A.E. * Ras al Khaimah, U.A.E. * Dubai, U.A.E. * Dubai Ivestments Park, Dubai, U.A.E. * Umm al Quwain, U.A.E. *International School of Choueifat \u2013 Lebanon, Koura, Lebanon * El- Mtein, Lebanon * Amman, Jordan * Riyadh, Saudi Arabia * Al-Sulaimaniah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia * Al-Wadi, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia * Jeddah, Saudi Arabia * Doha, Qatar * Damascus, Syria * Homs, Syria * Ruwais, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. * Muscat, Oman * Adma, Lebanon * Manama, Bahrain * Erbil, Kurdistan, Iraq * Dream City, Erbil, Kurdistan, Iraq * Sulaimani, Kurdistan, Iraq * Kalar, Sulaimani, Kurdistan, Iraq * Duhok, Kurdistan, Iraq * Soran, Kurdistan, Iraq * Zakho, Kurdistan, Iraq * Abu Dhabi Khalifa City \"A\", U.A.E. * Green Community, Dubai, U.A.E. * Cairo, Egypt * City of 6 October, Egypt *International School of Choueifat, Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan Charter Schools * SABIS International School - Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A. * Holyoke Community Charter School - Holyoke Massachusetts, U.S.A. * Collegiate Charter School of Lowell - Lowell Massachusetts, U.S.A. * SABIS International Charter School - Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A. * International Academy of Flint - Flint, Michigan, U.S.A. * Mid-Michigan Leadership Academy - Lansing, Michigan, U.S.A. * International Academy of Saginaw - Saginaw, Michigan, U.S.A. * International Academy of Atlantic City Charter School - Pleasantville, New Jersey, U.S.A. * International Academy of Trenton Charter School - Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A.
