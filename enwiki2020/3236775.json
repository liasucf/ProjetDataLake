The Kaidu River is the most important tributary to Lake Bosten, accounting for about 83% of its water inflow, other significant tributaries are the Huangshui Ditch (), the Qingshui River (), and Wulasite River (). An active fishery exists on the lake. Until the early 1970s, two cyprinid species, Schizothorax biddulphi and Aspiorhynchus laticeps, the latter of which is endemic to Bosten Lake and the Yarkand River, were responsible for 80 percent of the annual catch.K. F. Walker and H.Z. Yang, Fish and Fisheries in Western China, in Fish and Fisheries at Higher Altitudes: Asia (FAO Fisheries Technical Paper), December 1999 During the years 1962 to 1965, various carp species (bighead, black, silver, grass, common, and crucian carp) were introduced into the lake. In the 1970s, these species become major targets of the fishing activities. Since 1978, the introduced European perch has been the dominating species in the catches from Bosten Lake. ==References== ==External links== *Google Earth view Bosten Category:Lakes of Xinjiang Category:Sites along the Silk Road ",
