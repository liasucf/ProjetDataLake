It was located 500 metres from the dike of the present-day Zuid- Beveland, north of Krabbendijke. Today some ruins are clearly visible on satellite pictures. The small remaining part of the former domain of Nieuwlande was a separate municipality until 1816, when it was merged with Krabbendijke. Nieuwlande has a coat of arms and a flag (an armorial banner). They depict a red down-turned crescent on a white field, with six green and white wavy lines underneath.A.M.
