This species is sought after for food but also to be used as a trumpet when the tip of the spire is cut off.Sealifebase : Pleuroploca trapezium; accessed : 24 November 2010Felicia Shanthini and Jamila Patterson, Processing of horse conch, Pleuroploca trapezium, (Fasciolariidae) meat into meat balls; Asian Fisheries Science 18 (2005): 265-273. ==Subspecies and formae== * Subspecies Pleuroploca trapezium audouini (Jonas, 1846) * Forma Pleuroploca trapezium f. intermedia (Kobelt, 1875) * Forma Pleuroploca trapezium f. paeteli (Strebel, 1911) ==Description== The golden brown shell is solid and heavy. Its shell size varies between 85 mm and 250 mm with a common length of 200 mm. The spire is of moderate length. The apex is usually eroded. The sutures are constricted. The shoulders on the whorls are covered with spiral rows of slightly pointed strong nodules. The surface is covered with fine, brown, incised spiral lines, mainly in pairs. The outer lip is dentate with seven pairs of teeth, situated where the paired lines meet the edge. The oval aperture is pale with strong ridges internally. The columella is smooth posteriorly. The siphonal canal is extended and short. The fasciole is weak. Pleuroploca trapezium has been observed preying on the spiny cerith (Cerithium echinatum) in the Seychelles. Richard (Joseph R.)
