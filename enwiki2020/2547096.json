    "text": "WWF Forceable Entry is a soundtrack album by WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation, or WWF). Released on March 26, 2002 by Columbia Records, it features entrance music of WWE wrestlers re-recorded by various hard rock and heavy metal artists and bands. It is also the last album released under the \"WWF\" name, as the company changed its name to \"WWE\" in May 2002 after a British court ruled in favor of the World Wide Fund for Nature for ownership of the \"WWF\" initialism and branding (the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wide Fund for Nature had used the \"WWF\" name and branding since 1979 at the time). The album was a commercial success, charting at number three on the US Billboard 200. ==Composition== Johnny Loftus of music website AllMusic categorized WWF Forceable Entry as alternative metal, post-grunge and rap metal. The album features a number of cover versions (including Kid Rock's cover of \"Legs\" by ZZ Top) and remixes (such as Limp Bizkit's \"Rollin'\" and Marilyn Manson's \"The Beautiful People\"), as well as new tracks. Some tracks are also new recordings of wrestlers' entrance themes, including Drowning Pool's cover of Mot\u00f6rhead's \"The Game\" (Triple H) and Disturbed's recording \"Glass Shatters\" (Stone Cold Steve Austin). Finger Eleven's song \"Slow Chemical\" (Kane) is a bonus track on some versions of the album as well. ==Release== WWF Forceable Entry was released on March 26, 2002 by Columbia Records in association with SmackDown! Records, a division of WWE. ==Reception== ===Commercial=== WWF Forceable Entry was a commercial success. In the US, the album reached number three on the US Billboard 200; in Canada, it reached number three on the Canadian Albums Chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, indicating sales of over 500,000 units. The album sold over 145,000 copies in the US in its first week on sale. ===Critical=== Music website AllMusic awarded the album two out of five stars. Writer Johnny Loftus noted that Forceable Entry \"will be most relevant to wrestling fans,\" but joked that \"fans of heavy music ... might seek this set out in the local sale bin.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Jim Johnston \u2013 executive production, remix (track 9), mixing (track 15) *Jay Baumgardner \u2013 production (track 1), mixing (tracks 1 and 10) *James Murray \u2013 engineering (track 1) *Kid Rock \u2013 production and mixing (track 2) *Al Sutton \u2013 engineering (track 2) *John Kurzweg \u2013 production, engineering and mixing (track 3) *Eric Thorngren \u2013 production, recording and mixing (track 4) *Terry Date \u2013 production and recording (track 5) *Limp Bizkit \u2013 production (track 5) *Josh Abraham \u2013 additional production (track 5) *Scott Weiland \u2013 additional production (track 5) *Andy Wallace \u2013 mixing (track 5) *Raine Maida \u2013 production (track 6) *Adam Kasper \u2013 mixing (track 6) *Rob Zombie \u2013 production (track 7) *Scott Humphrey \u2013 production and programming (track 7) *Frank Gryner \u2013 engineering (track 7) *The Old Dark Horse \u2013 mixing (track 7) *Matt Martone \u2013 production and engineering (track 8) *Justin Rimer \u2013 production (track 8) *Jack Joseph Puig \u2013 mixing (tracks 8 and 18) *Trent Reznor \u2013 production (track 9) *Dave Ogilvie \u2013 production (track 9) *Bryan Scott \u2013 production (track 10) *Jeremy Parker \u2013 engineering (track 10) *Ben Grosse \u2013 production and mixing (track 11) *Adam Barber \u2013 engineering (track 11) *Blumpy \u2013 engineering (track 11) *Bob Marlette \u2013 production, engineering, mixing and programming (track 12) *Sid Riggs \u2013 programming (track 12) *Dave Wyndorf \u2013 production (track 13) *John Shyloski \u2013 engineering (track 13) *John Travis \u2013 mixing (track 13) *Cyrille Taillandier \u2013 programming (track 13) *Stereomud \u2013 production (track 14) *Big Red \u2013 engineering and mixing (track 14) *Doug Kaye \u2013 production and engineering (track 15) *Rick Duncan \u2013 engineering (track 15) *Audio Hustlerz \u2013 production and arrangements (track 16) *Troy Staton \u2013 mixing (track 16) *Edsel Dope \u2013 production and engineering (track 17) *Warren Dyker \u2013 mixing (track 17) *Jim Wirt \u2013 production and engineering (track 18) *Matt Pinfield \u2013 liner notes ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2002) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums Chart (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|3 |} ==Certifications== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Region !scope=\"col\"|Certification !scope=\"col\"|Sales/shipments |- !scope=\"row\"|United States (RIAA) |Gold |500,000^ |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:90%\"|^shipments figures based on certification alone |} ==See also== *Music in professional wrestling ==References== Forceable Entry WWF Forceable Entry WWF Forceable Entry WWF Forceable Entry WWF Forceable Entry ",
