The town has a large native Sunni population. It is also well known for its rich sea crabs as well as its clear blue seas. Before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, the inhabitants of Hidd were largely involved in the fishing or pearl diving industries. Many of Bahrain's fijiri performance groups are based in Hidd. Al Hidd is considered a very religiously and culturally conservative area of Bahrain, with many of the town's firjan, or neighborhoods, being composed of old buildings. ==Geography== Hidd lies south of the Bahrain International Airport and Arad. Situated close by is East Hidd City, a large public housing project under construction. The Shaikh Khalifa Causeway connects Hidd to Juffair on Bahrain Island. The altitude of Al Hidd is 3m. ==Government and infrastructure== Hidd used to be administered under its own municipality, but today it falls under the Muharraq Governorate. To the south of Hidd lies the Hidd Industrial Area, built on newly reclaimed land. In addition to several factories, the Industrial Area has built on it a large power plant, a water desalination plant (which supplies 75% of Bahrain's clean water requirements), and a drydock (Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard or ASRY). The Office of Ports and Maritime Affairs of the Ministry of Transportation has its headquarters in Building 702 in Hidd.\"Contact Us \" Ministry of Transportation.
