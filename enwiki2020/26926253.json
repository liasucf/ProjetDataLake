    "text": "Banksia attenuata resprouting from epicormic buds following a bushfire Resprouters are plant species that are able to survive fire by the activation of dormant vegetative buds to produce regrowth. Plants may resprout from a bud bank that can be located in different places, including in the trunk or major branches (epicormic buds) or in belowground structures like lignotubers, bulbs, and other structures. Resprouters characterize chaparral, fynbos, kwongan, savanna and other landscapes that experience periodic fires. ==See also== *Adventitiousness *Coppicing *Crown sprouting *Cutting (plant) *Epicormic shoot *Geoxyle *Water sprout ==References== Category:Wildfire ecology Category:Plant morphology Category:Plant physiology ",
