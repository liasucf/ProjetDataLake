    "text": "OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1170 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way. Spectral type of the star is type K dwarf star, slightly cooler and less luminous than the Sun. ==Planetary system== However, in 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) detected periodic dimming in the star's light curve indicating a transiting, planetary-sized object. Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004 the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet, OGLE-TR-113b. == See also == * OGLE-TR-132 * Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment * List of extrasolar planets == References == == External links == Category:K-type main-sequence stars Category:Planetary transit variables Category:Carina (constellation) Category:Planetary systems with one confirmed planet Carinae, V752 ",
