    "text": "The 51st Georgia Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The regiment was formed in March 1862, and initially assigned to defensive duty in South Carolina. It was engaged at the Battle of Secessionville near Charleston before being sent northward for duty in Virginia. Upon reaching Virginia in July 1862, the 51st Georgia was assigned to Drayton's Brigade within the Army of Northern Virginia. After the Battle of Antietam in September, Robert E. Lee decided to reorganize his army for more efficiency, and the 51st Regiment was permanently assigned to Paul Jones Semmes's brigade. The subsequent brigade commanders were Goode Bryan and James P. Simms. The 51st stayed in this brigade for the duration of the Civil War. The regiment was a part of the Army of Northern Virginia from July 1862 until its surrender at Appomattox Court House, except during James Longstreet's 1863 independent expedition to Georgia and East Tennessee. ==Organization== ===Staff=== *Colonel **William Marion Slaughter (March 22, 1862, to May 2, 1863; Killed at Chancellorsville, Virginia) **Edward Ball (May 2, 1863, to November 13, 1864; Died of wounds received at Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864) **James Dickey (November 12, 1864, to end of war ) *Lieutenant Colonel **James Dickey (January 14, 1864, to November 12, 1864; Promoted to Colonel) **John P.
