    "text": "Ciudad Real (, ; ) is a municipality of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile\u2013La Mancha, capital of the province of Ciudad Real. It is the 5th most populated municipality in the region. == History == It was founded with the name Villa Real (\"Royal Town\") under the auspice of Alfonso X The Wise, who granted it a charter that followed the model of Cuenca's. Located within the dominion of the Military Order of Calatrava, the repopulation struggled initially. During the Middle Ages, four kilometres of walls and one hundred and thirty towers protected a population made up of Christians, Muslims and Jews. Villa Real hosted the Cortes of Castile in 1346. Juan II of Castile granted Villa Real the status of city in 1420, thus becoming Ciudad Real (\"Royal City\"). The city most probably did not have more than 2000 inhabitants by the time and despite having celebrated Cortes once, the dominant city in the area was still Almagro. City panorama by Johann Friedrich Leonart (1687). After the unification of the Iberian kingdoms under the Catholic Monarchs, Ciudad Real became the capital of the in 1691. This fact favoured its economic development which was shown by the construction of several important buildings. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake destroyed many of these buildings. In 1809, during the Peninsular War, French troops defeated the Spanish army and occupied the town, using the local hospital as their headquarters and barracks. Following the creation of the province of Ciudad Real as per the 1833 territorial division, the status of provincial capital of Ciudad Real was challenged by the cities of Almagro and Manzanares, with a similar population by the mid-nineteenth century. However the initiatives intending to take the provincial capital out of Ciudad Real did not succeed. Much of the centre was destroyed during the Spanish civil war. == Geography == === Location === Satellite view of Ciudad Real and Miguelturra.
