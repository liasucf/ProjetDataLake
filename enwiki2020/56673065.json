    "text": "Osculum Obscenum is the second studio album by Hypocrisy, released on October 12, 1993 on Nuclear Blast Records. This is the second of two studio albums with vocalist Masse Broberg, who would later be dismissed as vocalist, with guitarist Peter T\u00e4gtgren assuming the position instead. Hypocrisy's lyrics do not focus on the paranormal and science fiction as would be the case in later albums, instead focussing on more \"traditional\" death metal themes such as Satanism and anti-Christianity. The album was later remastered and re-released as a double disk album with their debut album Penetralia in 2013. The title of the album translates to \"obscene kiss\" from Latin. ==Track listing== ==Credits== ===Band members=== * Masse Broberg \u2013 vocals, lyrics * Peter T\u00e4gtgren \u2212 electric guitars, keyboards * Mikael Hedlund \u2212 bass guitar * Lars Sz\u00f6ke \u2212 drums ===Production=== * Produced and mixed by Peter T\u00e4gtgren * Cover art by Wes Benscoter * Executive producer M.
