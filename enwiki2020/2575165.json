In 1762, the year of his forty-second birthday, he was appointed county governor of the vast V\u00e4sternorrland County, which at that time consisted of the Medelpad, \u00c5ngermanland and J\u00e4mtland provinces. \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ld realized the possibilities of the area and often travelled through it, by foot or using a carriage. He put to good advantage his knowledge about agriculture and city planning to found new settlements, thus relieving the old, overcrowded ones and, with the main goal of improving agriculture, provided aid for the farmers in trenching dikes, a procedure which they had previously found difficult to utilize. Among his other innovations was the introduction of new plants, including potato and flax, which quickly became popular; organizing the removal of stones from fields; commissioning maps of various parts of the region; opening pharmacies and myriad other improvements designed to help the inhabitants. During the 1769 session of the Riksdag, opponents attacked his self-decided reforms, claiming he made them to glorify himself. They also made accusations that he enriched himself through embezzlement. Although \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ld instituted several drastic reforms, some of which were arbitrary, his accusers were known to have acted with political motives as well as envy. Ultimately, \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ld was not punished, but rather transferred to govern Nyk\u00f6ping County, a part of the larger S\u00f6dermanland County, where he continued his pattern of vigorously instituting reforms. In 1771 he was again accused of unlawful actions, but historical records do not indicate that he suffered any adverse consequences. Per Abraham \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ld died in Nyk\u00f6ping at the age of 70. His previous county of administration, V\u00e4sternorrland, has kept his memory and honoured it with various publications. The town of \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, founded in 1842, fifty-one years after his death, was named after him. ==See also== *List of V\u00e4sternorrland Governors ==References== * \"\u00d6rnsk\u00f6ld, Per Abraham\" biographical entry at the Nordisk Familjebok encyclopedia Category:County governors of Sweden Category:Swedish nobility Category:1720 births Category:1791 deaths Category:Place of birth missing Category:Age of Liberty people ",
