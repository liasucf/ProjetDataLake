It is considered the fourth level of international ski jumping, ranking below the World Cup, Continental Cup and FIS Cup. Most of the events are held on normal hills and large hills, with a construction point of 90 meters. All top level and other international events before the World Cup was founded were part of FIS (race) competitions. Higher competitive circuits are the World Cup, the Summer Grand Prix and the Continental Cup; the lower circuits include the FIS Cup and the Alpen Cup. ==History== International Ski Federation was founded in 1924 and in 1979 World Cup was introduced.
