New York, 2004 Carl Hagenauer founded what became the Werkst\u00e4tte Hagenauer Wien in 1898. His oldest son, Karl, who would eventually assume leadership of the family business, enrolled at the Vienna School of Applied Arts at age eleven. There he studied with Josef Hoffmann and Oskar StrnadLong, Christopher. \u201cThe Werkst\u00e4tte Hagenauer: Design and Marketing in Vienna Between the World Wars.\u201d Studies in the Decorative Arts 10 (Spring-Summer 2003) and created designs for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte art collective. After wartime service in the infantry, he resumed his training and qualified as an architect. He joined the family business in 1919. Hagenauer was responsive to the change in public taste influenced by the popularity of the Vienna Secession. His stylized animals and whimsical creatures handcrafted in brass had broad appeal in domestic and American markets.Rosenthal, Rudolph and Helena L. Ratzka. The Story of Modern Applied Art, New York, 1948 Some were useful, such as mirrors, cigar cutters, ashtrays,\"MOMA\" candlesticks, bookends, hood ornaments and lamp bases. Other larger sculptures in wood and metal (such as the iconic Josephine Baker in the collection of the Casa Lis Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum\"Museo Casa Lis\" in Salamanca) were purely decorative.Miller, Judith.

While Hagenauer was the principal designer of everyday objects (and some sculptures), his younger brother Franz specialized in sculpture. The company later also produced furniture, chiefly designed by Julius Jirasek.Beyerle, Tulga and Karin Hirschberge. A Century of Austrian Design: 1900-2005. Basel ; Boston : Birkh\u00e4user, 2006 Hagenauer's work found an avid American market partly through the efforts of New York gallery owner Rena Rosenthal, who featured the Josephine Baker sculpture in a 1935 window display. Rosenthal's patronage was critical to the post-war success of the Werkst\u00e4tte Hagenauer; the hostilities caused a delay of several years in her payment for a last container of products shipped in 1938 and the subsequent change in exchange rate was very advantageous to the Austrian craftsman, supporting rebuilding efforts.Kronsteiner, Olga.
