She was the second child of her parents. Her mother, Lee Sun Chau \u5468\u7406\u4fe1 (1890\u20131979), was one of the earliest Chinese female doctors of Western Medicine in China and was a resident physician in the David Gregg Hospital for Women and Children at the time of the birth of Rebecca Chan Chung. Her father, Po-Yin Chan (\u9673\u6b65\u8ce2) (1883\u20131965), was a revolutionary under Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and was a Senator of Guangzhou in the 1920s. ===Schooling=== Rebecca Chan Chung graduated from St. Paul's Girls\u2019 School (primary school, currently St. Paul's Co-educational College) in Hong Kong in 1933. In 1938, she graduated from Diocesan Girls' School (secondary school) in Hong Kong, when Miss H.D. Sawyer was the Headmistress. ==Career== Rebecca Chan Chung received her Nursing training administered by the Government of Hong Kong in Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong), Hong Kong, in 1938\u20131941. During the World War II Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941, she graduated in an emergency fashion, with her Certificate of Training issued by the Medical Department of the Government of Hong Kong on December 10. The certificate was signed by Principal Matron Alice Mary Davieshttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37835/supplement/22/data.pdf and Director of Medical Services Sir Percy Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke. During World War II in 1942\u20131943, Rebecca Chan Chung was a Nurse with the Flying Tigers and then the United States Army, both at or near Kunming Airport (currently Kunming Wujiaba International Airport), Kunming, China. She worked for doctor Fred Manget, who was under Claire Lee Chennault. In 1943\u20131944, as a flight stewardess (Nurse) with the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC),http://www.cnac.org/rebeccachan_piloted_to_serve_01.pdf she flew over The Hump across the Himalayas between Calcutta, India, and Chongqing, China, approximately fifty times. These flights were dangerous because the propeller airplanes available at that time were unsuitable for flying at the needed heights. In 1942, Japan had cut off the Burma Road, so the Hump route became the only access to China. In 1943\u20131948, Rebecca Chan Chung was a flight stewardess, nurse and then head nurse with the China National Aviation Corporation based in Dum Dum Airport (currently Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport), Kolkata (or Calcutta), India, and after 1946 in Shanghai Longhua Airport, Shanghai, China. Her autobiography, Piloted to Serve, provides details of her experience. In 1963, while serving as a Sister Tutor (Nursing instructor) with the Government of Hong Kong, Rebecca Chan Chung studied in the College of Nursing in Melbourne, Australia, where she received a Sister Tutor Diploma. In Hong Kong, she headed the large nursing school of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals as its Sister Tutor-in-Charge from 1964 to 1975. In 1974, she became a Fellow of the College of Nursing, Australia. Rebecca Chan Chung was appointed a member of the Hong Kong Nursing Board by Hong Kong Governor Sir Robert Black. She was made a member of the Hong Kong Midwifery Board by Hong Kong Governor Sir David Trench. In addition, she was elected and served as the President of the Hong Kong Association of Nurses and Midwives.Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, Piloted to Serve, 2012. ==Marriage and family== ===Husband=== Rebecca Chan Chung married Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (1917\u20132009) in Old Mission Church, Kolkata, India, on July 7, 1945. This day coincided with the July 7 Chinese National Day, chosen by the Government of China to remember the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of July 7, 1937. This Incident was instrumental in uniting the Chinese people to fight against the Japanese invasion in World War II. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung was a member of Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps (also known as Royal Hong Kong Regiment). While serving as a Gunner, he was wounded in action in Lei Yue Mun Fort in the Battle of Hong Kong (a part of World War II) in December 1941. In August 1945, about 1.5 months after the wedding, Leslie Wah-Leung Chung left his bride and Calcutta to study Economics at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States. The newlyweds were thus separate for 3.5 years. In Hong Kong in 1965\u20131968, Leslie Wah-Leung Chung was elected and served as the President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants\u2019 Association. His most noteworthy contribution was the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. He also founded St. Mark's School (Hong Kong),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/St._Mark%27s_School_%28better_angle_and_sky_blue_version%29.JPG and served as the Head of the Department of Commerce and Business Studies in Hong Kong Technical College (currently Hong Kong Polytechnic University).

Their combined military burial took place in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, on Easter Saturday, April 7, 2012. Veterans of Canada, United States, and Hong Kong were present in the ceremony.http://video.stratfordbeaconherald.com/search/random%20act%20of%20kindness/celebrating- two-lives-well- lived/1550780688001http://video.thedailyobserver.ca/search/all/source/niagara- falls-review/celebrating-two-lives-well- lived/1550780688001/video_id/1550780688001/page/3788 ===Daughter=== Deborah Chung (\u937e\u7aef\u73b2) is the second child of Rebecca Chan Chung and Leslie Wah-Leung Chung.
