This action, the Battle of Ghazni, took place during the First Anglo-Afghan War. This was the second medal awarded to all ranks of the British Army for a specific campaign, the Waterloo Medal being the first. It was struck in 1839 on the orders of Shuja Shah Durrani, the Shah of Afghanistan, to show his appreciation to the British forces who had helped restore him to his throne by storming the fortress. As the Shah died before the medals could be distributed, it was finally bestowed by the Governor-General of India in the name of the Government of India. ==Description== The medal was based on a design by John Luard, a British army officer and artist,Ghuznee Medal 1839 \u2013 designer discovered.
