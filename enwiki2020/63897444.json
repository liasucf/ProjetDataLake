Until 1996, the NCAA would hold just one annual women's golf championship for all programs across Division I, Division II, and Division III. The tournament was held at the Cobblestone Park Golf Course in Blythewood, South Carolina, a suburb of Columbia. Arizona State won the team championship, the Sun Devils' first. Susan Slaughter, from Arizona, won the individual title. ==Individual results== ===Individual champion=== * Susan Slaughter, Arizona (297, +9) ==Team results== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! dat-sort-type=number|Rank !!
