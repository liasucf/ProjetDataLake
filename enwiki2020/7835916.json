    "text": "KEXT-CD was a television station in the San Francisco Bay Area, broadcasting on virtual channel 27. ==History== KEXT began as K27EX, broadcasting to Modesto on channel 27 and receiving that callsign on September 21, 1994. It was owned by Warren L. Trumbly. In 2001, K27EX became KEXT-CA, a Class A station. After the Class A conversion, Trumbly sold KEXT to Univision in May 2002. The name of the licensee changed to Telefutura Sacramento and later UniM\u00e1s Sacramento as the station relayed KTFK. In June 2014, two weeks after Univision filed to convert it to digital from a site in San Jose, KEXT was sold by Univision to Central Valley Television for $5,000, plus 30% of the proceeds that might be received by the purchaser as a result of relinquishing the station's license due to a spectrum auction. On August 1, 2014, KEXT analog went off air in order to begin digital construction; it returned to the air two months later and received its license to cover that December. On April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that KEXT-CD was a successful bidder in the spectrum auction; Venture Technologies would be surrendering the station's license in exchange for $55,351,366, 30% of which would be owed to Univision due to the terms of that transaction.FCC Broadcast Television Spectrum Incentive Auction \u2014 Auction 1001 Winning Bids Venture Technologies surrendered KEXT-CD's license to the FCC for cancellation on July 31, 2017. ==References== ==External links== * EXT-CD Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in California Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:Defunct terrestrial television stations in the United States Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2017 Category:2017 disestablishments in California EXT-CD ",
