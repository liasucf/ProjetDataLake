    "text": "Psychiatric Metaphors is an American Psych punk rock musician from New Jersey. ==History== Psychiatric Metaphors is a garage and psychedelic punk project of multi-instrumentalist Samuel Taylor, from Brooklyn, New York City. The music is described as \"brimming with angst, action, and undiluted rock fury,\" and it is compared to the music of early Black Sabbath, Joy Division and the Dead Boys by The Aquarian Weekly. Taylor released two demo albums in 2013 and 2014, and the eight-track debut album 33 Thorne Street on cassette tape and digital download with King Pizza Records on 3 April 2015. The Deli compares the record to the music of Sonic Youth, Golden Animals and Moby Grape, and note that it \"mines the quarries of 60's psychedelia.\" In 2015, Psychiatric Metaphors performed at the CMJ music festival. They released their second ten-track album, entitled The Seeker, on cassette tape and digital download with Pizza King Records on 21 November 2015. Psychiatric Metaphors digitally released a six-track EP Psychiatric Metaphors, and a four-track version on 7\"-inch black and green vinyl, with Little Dickman Records, on 26 August 2016. The album is described by Impose as having a \"heavy metal sound that would surely be found in one's nightmares [with] earlier punk stylings [and] reverb for days. That year, they toured the Midwest and Southeast United States with Little Dickman Records artists. Psychiatric Metaphors performed at the North Jersey Indie Rock Festival on 23 September 2017.
