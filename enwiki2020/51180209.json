At the time of the disaster the Lifeboat operating there was RNLB Edward, Prince of Wales (ON 678). On 23 April 1947 the en route from Middlesbrough to Newport decided to stop at Sker Point on the Glamorgan coast not far from Porthcawl. Its three anchor cables were unable to hold the ship in the gale raging at the time and the ship foundered on the rocks, breaking into three. The Mumbles lifeboat, in attempting a rescue, was believed to have been overwhelmed by a freak wave and all the crew were drowned. Memorials to the crew stand in the churchyard of All Saints' Church, Oystermouth. A memorial service was held in Swansea attended by the Duke of Kent on the 50th anniversary of the disaster. ==References== Category:Maritime incidents in Wales Category:April 1947 events Category:1947 in Wales Category:History of Swansea Category:Swansea Bay Category:Disasters in Wales Category:Maritime incidents in 1947 ",
