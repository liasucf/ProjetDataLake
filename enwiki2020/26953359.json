    "text": "2,3-Dichlorophenylpiperazine (2,3-DCPP or DCPP) is a chemical compound from the phenylpiperazine family. It is both a precursor in the synthesis of aripiprazole and one of its metabolites. It is unclear whether 2,3-DCPP is pharmacologically active as a serotonin receptor agonist similar to its close analogue 3-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), though it has been shown to act as a partial agonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. ==Legality== 2,3-DCPP has been made illegal in Japan and Hungary after having been identified in seized designer drug samples.A Magyarorsz\u00e1gon megjelent, a K\u00e1b\u00edt\u00f3szer \u00e9s K\u00e1b\u00edt\u00f3szer- f\u00fcgg\u0151s\u00e9g Eur\u00f3pai Megfigyel\u0151 K\u00f6zpontj\u00e1nak Korai Jelz\u0151rendszer\u00e9be (EMCDDA EWS) 2005 \u00f3ta bejelentett ellen\u0151rz\u00f6tt anyagok b\u00fcntet\u0151jogi vonatkoz\u00e1s\u00fa besorol\u00e1sa ==Analogues and derivatives== As with the related compound mCPP, 2,3-DCPP is an essential precursor to several pharmaceutical drugs which are widely used in medicine, and is also formed as a metabolite of these drugs in patients, although generally only in insignificant amounts. * Aripiprazole * Cariprazine The positional isomer 3,4-dichlorophenylpiperazine (3,4-DCPP) is also known, and acts as both a serotonin releaser via the serotonin transporter, and a \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker, though with relatively low affinity at both targets. 3,4-DCPP, CAS# 57260-67-0 == See also == * Substituted piperazine * Phenylpiperazine == References == == External links == * ",
