    "text": "Faroe Islands Premier League in 2017, which they won 2\u20131 against \u00cdF Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur. TB/FC Su\u00f0uroy/Royn was a Faroese football club based in Trongisv\u00e1gur. The team was a result of a merger between all three clubs from the island of Su\u00f0uroy: Tv\u00f8royrar B\u00f3ltfelag, FC Su\u00f0uroy and Royn Hvalba. The agreement about the merger was so late that there was not enough time to find a new name and identity for the club, so the name was a combination of all three names of the clubs. The name was too long to use, so the media started to use the word Su\u00f0uroyarli\u00f0i\u00f0 instead, which means The team from Su\u00f0uroy and the supporters and the chairmen had agreed upon using the word Su\u00f0ringar, which means People of Su\u00f0uroy. The team got off to a very good start in the 2017 season. They had a new manager, the Scottish former international player Maurice Ross, and they had bought three Norwegian players. They also bought former FC Su\u00f0uroy player J\u00f3n Krossl\u00e1 Poulsen and former TB Tv\u00f8royri player Poul Ingason, who both had been playing for teams in the mid- and north- eastern part of the Faroe Islands and had decided to join the new team. TB/FC Su\u00f0uroy/Royn won their first match, which was against \u00cdF Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur. They have been number one or two from the beginning and at least until the first five rounds, after winning four and losing one match, gaining 12 points. The fifth match was against B36 T\u00f3rshavn, the Faroese champions in 2014 and 2015. The match was played on 23 April 2017 on their home field Vi\u00f0 St\u00f3r\u00e1 in Trongisv\u00e1gur in snowy and windy weather. B36 scored the first two goals, but then it turned in favour of the home team, who finished the game with a 3\u20132 victory. A team from the island Su\u00f0uroy didn't have such a successful start since TB in 1980; TB Tv\u00f8royri would have had 12 points if 3 points were awarded for winning a match as it is today. TB/FCS/Royn dropped form and finished the 2017 season only in 8th place. In the following year they finished one position better, but the merger collapsed after the season ended. TB inherited its place in the top division, FC Su\u00f0uroy resumed play in 2. deild and Royn in 3. deild. ==References== ==External links== *TB.fo *fcsuduroy.com *Royn.fo * Facebook-group Category:Association football clubs established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in the Faroe Islands Category:Defunct football clubs in the Faroe Islands ",
