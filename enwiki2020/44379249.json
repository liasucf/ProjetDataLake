Company Overview of JSC Ruselectronics Ruselectronics subsidiaries are also specializing in the development of software-defined radio systems, including SDR systems for naval surface ships.Ruselectronics Develop New-Generation Naval Communication System ==Innovation Program== In 2014 during annual exhibition Open Innovations Ruselectronics presented a unique rescue solution from high-rises. Ruselectronics subsidiary JSC 'Spetsmagnit' designed source-independent group escape system (EKSS) for rescuing people from high floors in high-rises based on magnetic eddy-currents braking systems - two escape and rescue pods equipped with magnetic systems which interact with an electric strap control bus housed in a separate fireproof shaft placed on the outside of the building. Thermographic camera produced by JSC 'Cyclone', Ruselectronics subsidiaryAs an escape pod full of people starts moving down, gravity induces eddy currents in the bus, which generate braking force by interacting with the system\u2019s magnetic field. One escape pod can lower up to 25 people at a time from a height of up 100 meters (330 ft) in less than a minute. In the meantime, the second (empty) escape pod connect to the first one, will rise to the top, ready to evacuate the next group of people. Ruselectronics Design to Help Evacuate People from High-rises At Interpolitex 2014, the 18th International Exhibition of Technologies and Methods to Ensure National Security, Ruselectronics presented a new mobile command post with thermografic cameras for remote observation and surveillance during security operations in areas affected by natural disasters, emergencies caused by technology, and in mass gatherings and potentially volatile crowds:Rostec Subsidiary Presents New Mobile Command Post > \u201cThe new vehicle-mounted thermal imaging system can be used by Emergency > Response during forest fires and by the police in zero visibility.
