He was appointed deputy auditor of the State in 1840, and clerk of the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court from 1848 to 1852. ==Campaign for President== In 1852 Broom ran for President of the United States under unusual circumstances for the Native American Party, later known as the American Party and generally known as the Know Nothings. Broom presided over the party's national convention, which nominated Daniel Webster as its presidential candidate. When Webster died nine days before the election, Broom was hurriedly named as his replacement, with Reynell Coates of New Jersey as his running mate.

Neither Webster nor Broom received any electoral votes. ==Congressional service== Broom was elected as a candidate of the American Party to the Thirty-fourth Congress in 1854.
