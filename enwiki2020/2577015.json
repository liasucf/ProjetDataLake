Based at first in Tautz' garage, Delta Specialty Company thrived, first making small tools for home shops and later expanding into light industrial machinery. In 1945, Rockwell Manufacturing Company acquired Delta Machinery and renamed it the Delta Power Tool Division of Rockwell Manufacturing Company and continued to manufacture in Milwaukee.http://www.deltadrillpressguide.com/a-history-of-delta-machinery/ In 1966, Rockwell invented the world's first power miter saw. In 1981, Rockwell's power tool group was acquired by Pentair and re-branded Delta Machinery. Pentair's Tools group was acquired by Black & Decker in 2004. ==Current ownership== In January, 2011, Taiwan-based Chang Type Industrial Co., Ltd. purchased the Delta brand from Stanley Black & Decker. Chang Type formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Delta Power Equipment Corp. to own the acquired assets including trademarks, designs and industrial tooling. Chang Type is moving Delta's production tooling from a Stanley Black & Decker owned facility in Jackson, Tennessee to a facility in Anderson County, South Carolina. Most recently, Delta has purchased an improved facility in Spartanburg, SC and has moved all operations to this location. ==References== * * * * ==External links== * Delta official website * Delta history at Vintage Machinery * Dewalt Random Orbit Sander Category:Power tool manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1919 Category:1945 mergers and acquisitions Category:1981 mergers and acquisitions Category:2004 mergers and acquisitions Category:2011 mergers and acquisitions ",
