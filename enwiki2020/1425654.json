Its facilities include the Kingston Military Community Sport Centre (KMCSC) with seating for 3737, the Navy Bay fields with seating for 800 and Constantine Arena with seating for 1500 and the Birchall Pavilion.http://english.cis- sic.ca/information/members_directory/rmc Canadian Interuniversity Sport Directory == Varsity sports program == RMC has a long-standing tradition of competing in a multitude of sports, often with great success, especially given the small size of the institution (1200 students). In 2002 however, the then commandant of the college, R.Adm. Morse, made the very controversial decision to greatly scale back the varsity sports program. This was done with the stated goal of increasing the competitiveness of the remaining sports by consolidating the skilled athletes. Also stated was a desire to encourage teamwork and leadership that would be necessary for cadets once they left the college. This move was wildly unpopular within the student body of the college, and amongst ex-Cadets, as it left many students who were very competitive in a sport of their choice without a means to participate. Among the teams cut were Men's and Women's rugby union, track and field, swimming, rowing, biathlon and karate; while the college kept the hockey, soccer, volleyball, basketball, taekwondo and fencing teams. In 2004, the College revisited their decision, and after a great deal of lobbying on the part of RMC alumni, and an enormous show of support from the student body, they brought back the Men's Rugby team at the Varsity level. The Paladins currently compete in five sports in the Ontario University Athletics Association (OUA): *Fencing (M/W) *Hockey (M) *Rugby union (M) *Soccer (M/W) *Volleyball (M/W) ==Facilities== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#ffcbcb\" | colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" | Facilities |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !Institution!!Football Stadium!!Seated Capacity!!Basketball Arena!!Seated Capacity!!Hockey Arena!!Seated Capacity!!Soccer Stadium!!Seated Capacity |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| RMC||No Football|| \u2013 ||Kingston Military Community Sports Centre||4000||Constantine Arena||1500||Sports Dome Navy Bay Soccer and Rugby Fields||2500 |} Image:Kingston Military Community Sports Center used by Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|Kingston Military Community Sports Center used by Royal Military College of Canada Image:Royal Military College of Canada campus inner field.jpg|Royal Military College of Canada campus inner field Image:Birchall Pavilion, Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|Birchall Pavilion, Royal Military College of Canada File:Royal Military College of Canada Constantine Arena.jpg|Royal Military College of Canada Constantine Arena File:St Lawrence Pier, Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|St Lawrence Pier, Royal Military College of Canada File:Royal Military College of Canada foot bridge.jpg|Royal Military College of Canada foot bridge from campus to Kingston Military Community Sports Center {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Institution !Team !City !Province !Founded !Affiliation !Enrollment !Endowment !Membership !Division |- | Royal Military College of Canada | Paladins | Kingston | ON | 1876 | Public | 900http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Royal-Military-College- of-Canada.html | * | OUA | East |- |} ==RMC Coaching== Paladins scoreboard, inner field, Royal Military College of Canada The Director of Athletics, Darren Cates, oversees Physical Education, Recreation, Intramurals and the varsity program and has 26 full-time employees. \"At a civilian university you must justify why physical activity is important.

This photo of Royal Military College of Canada cadets doing a gymnastics routine, taken in 1901 in Kingston, is part of the Canada Patent and Copyright Office collection. The cadets are performing human pyramids, where the students work on balance, strength, cooperation, and teamwork. In this stunt, participants form pyramids of layers of persons, each standing on two others one level lower, one half a position to the right and the other to the left. In 1931\u201332, Brigadier WHP Elkins, RMC Commandant, introduced an academic eligibility rule for participation on the hockey and football teams which barred cadets with academic averages below 40%. He subsequently reported an improvement in the quality of the classwork and another successful year in intercollegiate competition.R. Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College' (Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1969) == Redmen to Paladins == Royal Military College Redmen logo Once RMC re-opened after World War II, varsity athletes representing RMC were proud to call themselves the Redmen in competition. It represented one of the most prevalent facets of RMC tradition, the wearing of the scarlet uniform on formal parades. Gentlemen cadets first took on the name because it was an all-male institution at the time and due to the red uniform, hence red-men, informally \"Reddies\". In 1996, women had been studying as RMC cadets for sixteen years so college authorities thought it was necessary to change the varsity title to something that was representative of the whole cadet wing. Furthermore, the college was receiving some criticism that Redmen was a derogatory name for Canada's Aboriginal People. With the closure of Royal Roads Military College (RRMC) and College militaire royal de St-Jean (CMR) in 1995, RMC saw two more student bodies join the college. Because of a large induction of francophone students from CMR, RMC was transformed into a bilingual university. General Charles Emond, the commandant at the time, decided that the Redmen was not a fit name for this bilingual and coeducational institution. Therefore, he invited the officer cadets to choose a new name. Gen Emond set out very specific criteria for the Redmen's replacement. He decreed that the new name had to be representative of the profession of arms; it had to be identified in two languages; it also had to be unisex and original. Furthermore, the name needed to be representative of a person, people or animal rather than an inanimate object. The logo associated with the name had to be simple and easily identifiable for the public. The new name should also be easily incorporated into college chants and songs. Various committees, composed of cadets and staff, came up with twenty-four new names for the varsity teams, such as the Cavaliers or the Red's, the two most popular names were the Sabers and the Paladins. There was vote cast by the staff and students to decide on which of the three top choices would be the one. A committee of twenty-four people was established to advertise each of the proposed names. The committee held an electoral campaign of sorts where each name was given a logo and mascot to better relate to the college on what they were voting for. The whole process of finally choosing a name took two years to complete and as a result, the college was without a sports name for the 1996\u201397 season. In 1997, the Director of Cadets, Lieutenant Colonel (LCol) Michaud released the new name. All RMC representative sports teams would now be called the Paladins. The name Paladins had won by a landslide of 70% of the votes, it was also the only name that met the criteria demanded by Gen Emond. Royal Military College of Canada mascot: Paladin Since 1997, athletes of the Royal Military College of Canada have been known as the Paladins. Paladins were knights of the Crusades who modeled themselves as honest, courageous, loyal and chivalrous knights who prided themselves on their skill in battle. In 2002, Rear-Admiral David Morse, the commandant at the time, decided to change the logo to the royal crown and mailed fist of RMC. Some of the sports teams, namely the Hockey team and the Rugby team, still continue to call themselves 'Redmen' in unofficial forums. Although the uniforms now say Paladins, those teams have never accepted the name change and keep up the old tradition. In 2001, the RMC cut their interuniversity programs from 30 down to 11. In 2007, the RMC Running Team started once again to compete at the OUA / CIS level. == West Point Weekend == Paladins goalie during 2014-15 season. West Point series plaque, RMC vs USMA, Currie Hall, RMC The West Point series originated when the commandant of RMC, Sir Archibald McDonnell and the superintendent of the United States Military Academy (West Point), Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, suggested a game of hockey between the two schools in 1921. After two years of exchanging ideas the first game was played on February 23, 1923 at West Point.Greg Gillespie Go army! beat RMC? the history of the United States military academy-royal military college of Canada hockey rivalry International Journal of the History of Sport, Volume 17, Issue 1 March 2000 , pages 94 - 112 The Redmen won that first game 3\u20130 and a New York paper stated \"Army was beaten at hockey today by Royal Military College of Kingston, Ontario. The Canadian cadets excelled the Army men all the way, displaying the best all-around form seen here in years. Hamilton and the Carr- Harris's were the outstanding stars of the Canadian team. This game was one of the cleanest-fought contests staged here this winter and was marked by a fine display of sportsmanship on both sides.\" In commemoration of the game, RMC donated the \"Challenge Trophy\". In 1924, the series moved to Kingston thus beginning the tradition of rotating venues. This was Army's first away game and up until 1941 the West Point Game was the only time that Army played away from the Academy. From 1923\u20131935 RMC ran up a record of 14\u20130\u20131.

In 1986, the record stood at 26\u201325\u20134 in favour of RMC. Army dominated over the next 15 years, going unbeaten from 1988\u20131999.
