    "text": "Ann Forrest (known also by her birth name Anna Kromann and as Ann Kroman or Ann Kornan; 14 April 1895 \u2013 25 October 1985 ) was a Danish-born American actress of Hollywood's silent films. ==Biography== Forrest was born 14 April 1895 in S\u00f8nderho, Denmark and died 25 October 1985 in San Diego, California. Between 1915 and 1925, she appeared in 33 movies. According to Ruth Wing, author of the Blue Book of the Screen, Forrest enjoyed playing homely character roles, and her characters often wept during the film. However, wanting to capitalize on her beauty, producers later cast her in society dramas. Wing wrote \"Ann Forrest is 'different'. She is different from most screen stars in personality and beauty. But the greatest difference lies in her achievement of cinema fame. Ann wept her way to stardom.\"Ruth Wing, Blue Book of the Screen , Pacific Gravure Company, Hollywood, CA 1923 Forrest in ad for The Great Impersonation, 1922 ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
