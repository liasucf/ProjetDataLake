The river flows through the Qualla Boundary, a federal land trust that acts as a reservation for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. ==Geology== Beech Flats Prong is a stream formed by the convergence of several spring outlets high in the Appalachians near Newfound Gap, a mountain pass that straddles the Tennessee\u2013North Carolina border in the center of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The creek flows about south where it merges with Smith Branch, Kepharts Prong, and the Kanati Fork to form the Oconaluftee River. The river continues south, where it is joined by the Bradley Fork, greatly strengthening its flow. A large, flat bottomland is created by the river's confluence with the Raven Fork at Cherokee, where the river turns westward, flowing to its mouth on the Tuckasegee River, near Bryson City in Swain County, North Carolina.Oconaluftee River; GeoNames; US gov on-line; accessed August 2019 The Oconaluftee passes through the settlements of Smokemount, the Oconaluftee Village and Hospital, the town of Cherokee, Indian Hills, and Birdtown before emptying into the Tuckasegee. ==History== A river trail sign The Cherokee people considered the Ocona Luftee waters to be sacred.Bush, Florence Cope; Dorie: Woman of the Mountains; Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press; (1992); The name, \"Ocona Luftee\" was derived from the name of the Cherokee village, \"Egwanulti,\" which was erected on its banks prior to the area's colonization by European frontiersmen. The name translates to \"by the river\" in English. The river, and the village, pre-dates the arrival to the area of early scientific explorer, John Bartram.Mooney, James, Myths of the Cherokee; From Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology 1897-98, Part I. [1900]; ; During the time of the Indian removals, the Cherokee who lived on private lands which had been individually purchased were not subject to removal. About 500 Cherokee led by Yonaguska lived on land along the Oconaluftee which was owned by a white man in trust for the Cherokee, to protect it for them. William Holland Thomas had been adopted by Cherokee as a boy, and therefore this band of Cherokee could remain, safe from removal. These were joined by a smaller band of about 150 who lived along the Nantahala River led by Utsala. Other groups living in Snowbird and along the Cheoah River (in Tomotley) also stayed. If needed, they could all gather on the land held in trust by Thomas, and be safe. These are today the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, numbering approximately 2000. In the 1870s, the people expanded their lands with the purchase of the Qualla Boundary. ==Research== Prolific areas of archeological remains are found especially in the flat bottom lands about the mouth of Mingus creek, Toe String creek, Bradley Fork, and Collins creek.Southern Indian Studies, vol. 2 - No. 2; Wood, William; Wilburn, Hiram; Archeological Society of North Carolina and The Laboratory of Anthropology & Archeology [at] The University of North Carolina; Chapel Hill; (October 1950); pdf download ==Notes== Category:Rivers of North Carolina Category:Rivers of Swain County, North Carolina Category:Rivers of Jackson County, North Carolina Category:Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907) ",
