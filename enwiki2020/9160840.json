In September 1905, she married, at Mbale, as his third wife, Semei Lwakirenzi Kakungulu, then Kabaka of Bukedi. ==His reign== The period from 1884 through 1897 witnessed tremendous strife in Buganda. Sufficient Baganda had converted to one of the three major religions in the kingdom; Catholicism, Protestantism or Islam. As the ruling class in the kingdom attempted to adjust to the loss of absolute authority over their subjects' lives to these new religions; the kingdom was thrown into turmoil, rebellion, counter-rebellion and religious persecution. Within a period of thirteen years from 1884 until 1897, Buganda witnessed the change of leadership at Mengo, six times, which was unprecedented in the kingdom. Various Kabaka's took sides with one religion or the other, only to be deposed by the supporters of the religions they did not choose. And the cycle repeated itself. In October 1888, the Muslim faction was dominant in Buganda. All Christian missionaries were expelled, and Kabaka Kiweewa Mutebi Nnyonyintono was deposed. Kabaka Kalema Muguluma, who had converted to Islam and taken on the name Rashid, was installed on the throne by Kiweewa's Katikiro, Muguluma. However, only one year later, he was forced to step down by the British imperial forces. He was offered an ultimatum by the British: either convert to Christianity and retain the throne, or remain Muslim and lose the throne. He evidently chose Islam and was deposed. Two months into his reign, Kalema sent gifts of ivory to the Sultan of Zanzibar and an accompanying letter. In the letter, Kalema proclaimed himself Sultan of Buganda, and declared his plan to turn it into a Muslim state. He made a request for Korans to teach the Muslims, as well as guns to protect his country form Christian invaders.Sir John M. Gray, 1950. The Year of the Three Kings of Buganda. \"Uganda Journal\", 14, pp.15-52. When the Christian refugees allied themselves with Mwanga, in an attempt to usurp Kalema's throne, Kalema sought to strengthen his position by purging all members of the royal family that could be lured to join the Christian cause. He decreed that all princes and princesses should be burnt alive. About thirty princes and princesses perished in this massacre, including Mwanga's infant sons Kyonya and Kagalo.Sir John M. Gray, 1950, ibid. This mass killing of his relatives angered public opinion. The manner in which Kiweewa was killed - starved of food for several days, after which he was shot to death and his wives also put to death - was viewed as not fit for the treatment of a king, and a blemish on the institution of the Kabaka.Sir Apollo Kaggwa, 1901. Ekitabo kya Basekabaka b'e Buganda. Therefore the people were less wlling to enlist for his army in the forthcoming war against the Christian forces. In the ensuing war, he was defeated and fled to Singo. ==The final years== After his removal from the throne by the British, Kabaka Kalema went into exile in Bunyoro. He died in exile from complications of smallpox in January 1891. At the time of his death, his age is estimated to have been in the mid-twenties. His remains were repatriated and buried at Mmende in Busiro. ==Succession table== ==See also== * Kabaka of Buganda ==References== ==External links== * List of Kings of Buganda Category:Kabakas of Buganda Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa Category:19th-century births Category:1891 deaths Category:Deaths from smallpox ",
