    "text": "Pok\u00e9mon Heroes: Latios and Latias is a 2002 Japanese animated fantasy film, the fifth in the Pok\u00e9mon series, and the last to feature the main cast from the first five seasons until the CGI remake of the first Pok\u00e9mon movie. Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and produced by OLM, Inc., the film stars the regular television cast of Rica Matsumoto, Yuji Ueda, Mayumi Iizuka, Megumi Hayashibara, Shin-ichiro Miki and Ikue \u014ctani. The English adaptation was produced by 4Kids Entertainment and distributed by Miramax Films and saw a limited release in the United States on May 16, 2003, before being released to video and DVD in January 2004. The English version stars the regular television cast of Veronica Taylor, Eric Stuart, Rachael Lillis and Maddie Blaustein. The events of the film take place during the fifth season of Pok\u00e9mon: Master Quest. Pok\u00e9mon Heroes focuses on the main characters, Ash, Misty and Brock, continuing their journey through the Johto region; the main location of the film is based on Venice, Italy. The name given to the city in the film is Alto Mare, meaning \"high sea\" in the Italian language. Although it is part of the group's adventure in Johto, the film takes place on an island off of the mainland. Optimum Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD in UK on May 9, 2011. StudioCanal released the film along with Pok\u00e9mon 4Ever on Blu-ray in the UK as a double feature pack on April 2, 2012, just one day before Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: Black\u2014Victini and Reshiram and White\u2014Victini and Zekrom came out on DVD on April 3, 2012. Echo Bridge Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in the United States along with Pok\u00e9mon: Destiny Deoxys on May 15, 2011. == Plot == The film is set in the Venetian-esque city of Alto Mare, protected by the dragon siblings Latias and Latios. Their father, also a Latios, is said to have saved the city from an evil Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and their Kabutops and Aerodactyl whilst transforming the city's streets into canals. The citizens built the Defence Mechanism of Alto Mare (or \u201cD.M.A.\u201d for short) to protect the city if necessary, but have never had to use it. The father Latios died, leaving behind the Soul Dew, said to contain his own soul and can power the D.M.A. In the present day, Team Rocket agents Annie and Oakley acquire a book detailing the history of Alto Mare, plotting to control the D.M.A. Ash, Misty, and Brock are touring by and see an invisible Latias. Annie and Oakley stalk Latias, who disguises herself as a human girl, trying to capture her using their Espeon and Ariados. Ash and Pikachu come to the rescue, guiding Latias to safety but she vanishes when Ash's back is turned. Visiting the museum, the trio meet the curator Lorenzo who details Alto Mare's history, the D.M.A., and the fossilized Pok\u00e9mon on display. Ash spots a girl, Bianca, who resembles Latias\u2019 disguise, and chases her across the city, but she does not recognise him. Latias herself appears, guiding Ash and Pikachu to a hidden garden where she and Latios live, protected by Lorenzo and Bianca, his granddaughter. While Pikachu plays with Latias and Latios, Lorenzo shows Ash the Soul Dew, unaware that Annie and Oakley's drone has infiltrated the sanctuary. That night, Annie and Oakley sneak into the garden, successfully capturing Latios and the Soul Dew, but Latias escapes. Bianca and Lorenzo attempt to stop the thieves from using the D.M.A. but are captured, the Soul Dew and Latios are used to power the machine. Latias goes to Ash for help, with Latios\u2019 \u201cSight Sharing\u201d ability allowing them to witness the events in the museum. Oakley becomes power hungry, using the D.M.A. to resurrect Kabutops and Aerodactyl, and initiates a citywide lockdown to prevent interference. Ash, Pikachu and Latias evade the lockdown, racing to the museum while being pursued by the fossilised Pok\u00e9mon. Oakley tries to drown Ash, Pikachu and Latias, but the latter's psychic powers cause the D.M.A. to go out of control. Reaching the museum, the trio rescue Latios and shut down the machine. However, Annie tries to take the blackened Soul Dew, which shatters, causing all of the city's water to flow out and return as a tidal wave. Latias and Latios combine their powers to stop the wave, Latios giving his life in the process. Kabutops and Aerodactyl perish again, while Annie and Oakley remain trapped in the D.M.A.. Ash and friends find Latias, realising Latios has died, but they share one last vision as he passes away. Several days later, Ash, Misty and Brock get ready to leave Alto Mare, saying goodbye to Lorenzo, but Bianca does not appear. On their way out of the city, they spot Bianca on the docks but she isn't wearing her hat (the usual difference between Bianca and Latias). The girl gives Ash a sketch of him and Pikachu, kisses him on the cheek, and leaves without saying a word, but Ash bids \"her\" goodbye anyway. Whether the girl was Bianca or Latias is left to the viewer. == Japanese version == The Japanese version had a few key differences from the English version. * Annie and Oakley were not affiliated with Team Rocket. * The original Soul Dew may or may not have the soul of a Latios inside it at all. The one that appears after Latios' death still does. * Latios' Japanese voice was not retained in the dub, which opted to use Latias's voice clips instead. * The American version edited out the prologue where Annie and Oakley were reciting the legend of Alto Mare from the book they were about to steal. The prologue is as follows: A long time ago, Alto Mare was just a small town. One day, an old couple walking along the beach found two unconscious children lying in the sand. They brought the children home and took care of them. But a dark cloud above Alto Mare rained down shards of darkness. Anything these shards touched became dark as well. One shard was about to hit the old couple when the children started to glow and all the shards were destroyed. The children revealed themselves as Latios and Latias. More appeared, one of them carrying the Soul Dew. Their power, combined with the Soul Dew's, shone upon the dark cloud, vanquishing it. In gratitude for their help, the two Latios and Latias gave the Soul Dew to the old couple. == Cast == {|class=\"wikitable\" ! Character !! Japanese voice !!

Lou Lumenick did not gave the film any stars and called it an animated form of child abuse and recommend parents to rent Spirited Away for their children. Desson Thomson said \"This one's for kids and no one else\". === Box office === The film opened up alongside with Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones in Japan (where it had opened at number one), and failed to out-gross it. It later fell to ninth place at the Japanese box office behind Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones and Stuart Little 2. The film grossed in Japan. In its North American run, the movie was a commercial failure. This was due to facing competition from X2, The Matrix Reloaded, (which had opened the day before its American release), Bruce Almighty, and the premiere of Finding Nemo. It was also due to having a limited run in theaters (Only opening with 196). The film closed down its American run on July 10, 2003, grossing $746,381. In total, the film's worldwide gross was . As of 2019, it is the lowest grossing Pok\u00e9mon movie in the entire franchise. It also results the next Pok\u00e9mon film to have a direct- to-DVD release instead. == Notes == == References == == External links == * * * * * Category:2002 anime films Category:Films set in Venice Heroes Category:Toho animated films Category:Films directed by Kunihiko Yuyama Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese animated fantasy films Category:Japanese fantasy adventure films Category:Japanese sequel films Category:Films scored by Shinji Miyazaki ",
