The game was televised nationally by TBS. The game took place on October 4 at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona. with the Diamondbacks winning 11\u20138, thus eliminating the Rockies from the postseason and advancing the Diamondbacks to the NL Division Series (NLDS) in which they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers 3\u20130. ==Background== This was Arizona's first playoff appearance as a Wild Card team, and their first postseason appearance since the 2011 National League Division Series. This was Colorado's fourth playoff appearance (all as a Wild Card team), and their first postseason appearance since the 2009 National League Division Series. This was the second postseason match-up between the two clubs; previously the Rockies swept the Diamondbacks in the 2007 National League Championship Series. Jon Gray started for the Rockies, and Zack Greinke started for the Diamondbacks. ==Game results== ===Line score=== Gray was rocked early, allowing two singles to start the bottom of the first, followed by a three-run home run to Paul Goldschmidt. Gray was ultimately knocked out of the game in the bottom of the second after David Peralta singled and scored on Ketel Marte's triple. Daniel Descalso's two-run home run off Tyler Anderson in the third made it 6\u20130 Diamondbacks. While Greinke coasted through the first three innings, he was unable to complete the fourth inning. After allowing two singles and recording one out, Gerardo Parra's single, Mark Reynolds's groundout, Jonathan Lucroy's double, and Alexi Amarista's pinch hit single scored a run each and reduced the Diamondback's lead to 6\u20134. This lead was cut further to 6-5 in the seventh when Lucroy doubled, moved to third on Robbie Ray's wild pitch and scored on Charlie Blackmon's bunt groundout off Jorge De La Rosa, but the Diamondbacks extended their lead to 8\u20135 in the bottom of the inning on Archie Bradley's two-run triple off Pat Neshek. In the process, Bradley not only became the first relief pitcher to record a triple in a playoff game, but also the sixth pitcher in Major League history to record a triple during the playoffs. Back-to-back home runs by Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story off Bradley in the eighth cut the Diamondbacks' lead back to one. The Diamondbacks responded in the bottom half of the inning with A.J. Pollock's two-run triple off Greg Holland (which made the Diamondbacks the first team since the Boston Americans in 1903 to record four triples in a playoff game). After an intentional walk, Jeff Mathis's RBI squeeze single made it 11\u20137 Diamondbacks. In the ninth, Ian Desmond hit a leadoff single off Fernando Rodney, who struck out the next two batters, but Desmond advanced two bases on defensive indifferences before scoring on Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez's single to cut the Rockies' deficit to 11\u20138. Arenado then grounded out to end the game as the Diamondbacks advanced to the NLDS. ==References== ==External links== *2017 Major League Baseball postseason schedule *Box score National League Wild Card Game Category:Major League Baseball Wild Card Playoff National League Wild Card Game Category:Arizona Diamondbacks postseason Category:Colorado Rockies postseason Category:2010s in Phoenix, Arizona Category:2017 in Arizona Category:2017 in sports in Arizona Category:2010s in Denver Category:2017 in sports in Colorado ",
