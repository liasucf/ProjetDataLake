Percival worked there from 1877 to 1884. Mrs T. A. (Charlotte) Cotton, a member of the Spence family, endowed him with a scholarship. He matriculated on 13 October 1884 at St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated there with B.A. in 1887, M.A. in 1891, and Sc.D. in 1922. From 1894 to 1903 he was a professor of botany at the Agricultural College at Wye in Kent. At University College, Reading, he was director of the Agricultural Department from 1903 to 1907 and professor of agricultural botany from 1907 to 1932. The Linnean Society elected him a Fellow in 1893 and a vice-president for 1926\u20131927. William Broadhurst Brierley was his successor in the professorship from which Percival retired in 1932.Bunting, p. 24 Around 1928, Piotr M. Zhukovsky () sent Percival a possibly complete collection of the species of the genus Aegilops. During WWII the Aegilops collection at Leningrad was destroyed, and John Jones in the late 1950s was able to send a complete set of Aegilops species to the USSR. Starting around 1927, Percival received numerous desiccated or carbonised samples of cereal grains from tombs or other archaeological sites in Egypt, the Near East, and western Asia. The samples and Percival's identifications were important in developing archaeobotany at the University of Reading.Bunting, p. 22 On 17 August 1896 he married Ethel Elizabeth Hope-Johnstone. Alan Vivian Percival (born 1899) was their only child who survived to adulthood. Upon John Percival's death he was survived by his widow and son. ==Legacy== According to Laura A. Morrison, the modern era of wheat taxonomy began with three works: Die Geschichte der Kultivierten Getreide (1913) by August Schulz (1862\u20131922), Neuere Wege und Ziele der botanischen Systematik, erl\u00e4utert am Beispiele unserer Getreidearten (1913) by Albert Thellung, and The Wheat Plant (1921) by Percival. (p. 70) On the 12th and 13th of July 1999, the University of Reading's School of Plant Sciences, in collaboration with the Linnean Society, held a symposium to celebrate Percival's life and work. ==Selected publications== * * * * (2nd edition, 1948) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1863 births Category:1949 deaths Category:19th-century British botanists Category:20th- century British botanists Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Academics of the University of Reading Category:Fellows of the Linnean Society of London ",
