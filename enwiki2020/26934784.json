    "text": "Giwargis II () was Patriarch of the Church of the East from 828 to 831. == Sources == Brief accounts of Giwargis's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth- century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).Bar Hebraeus, Chronicon Ecclesiasticum (ed. Abbeloos and Lamy), iii. 188 Modern assessments of his reign can be found in Jean-Maurice Fiey's Chr\u00e9tiens syriaques sous les Abbassides and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Fiey, Chr\u00e9tiens syriaques sous les Abbassides, 67; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 146 == Giwargis's patriarchate == The following account of Giwargis's patriarchate is given by Mari: > Giwargis was a native of al-Karkh, and superior of the monastery of Beth > Abe. He was a very prudent and intelligent man, but had little knowledge of > doctrine. He once approached Gabriel ibn Bokhtisho, and asked him to divide > equally an estate which a man had seized from him. Gabriel saw that he was a > righteous man, and at his request Timothy appointed him metropolitan of > Jundishapur, where he remained for twenty years. He was elected after the > death of Isho Bar Nun by Gabriel and Mikha'il, but was unsuitable on account > of his great age, as he was nearly a hundred years old and suffered from > sciatica. He was appointed in the year 210, and needed the support of two > men or a stick whenever he wanted to walk. He died at the age of 104, and > was buried in the monastery of Klilisho. The length of his catholicate was > four years.Mari, 76 (Arabic), 67 (Latin) ==See also== * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East ==Notes== ==References== * Abbeloos, J. B., and Lamy, T.
