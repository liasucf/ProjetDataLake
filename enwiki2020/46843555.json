About 1850, a frame Greek Revival-style I-house was added. A two-story frame wing was added about 1935. A center-bay two-story pedimented porch flanked by one-story, full-facade, attached porches were added to the front facade in the 1930s. Also on the property is a contributing outbuilding. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Colonial Revival architecture in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Houses in Wake County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wake County, North Carolina ",
