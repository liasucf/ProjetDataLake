    "text": "Dimethoate is a widely used organophosphate insecticide and acaricide. It was patented and introduced in the 1950s by American Cyanamid. Like other organophosphates, dimethoate is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which disables cholinesterase, an enzyme essential for central nervous system function. It acts both by contact and through ingestion. It is readily absorbed and distributed throughout plant tissues, and is degraded relatively rapidly. == Fruit Fly Control Efforts == The Queensland fruit fly, or Bactrocera Tyroni, is a tephritid fly species that has caused more than $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian fruit crops. In order to combat infestation, farmers treated crops with dimethoate and fenthion. However, the use of these chemicals was banned in 2011 due to safety concerns. ==Trade names== *Rogor https://www.ravensdown.co.nz/products/agrochemicals/rogor == References == == External links == * EPA Report on Dimethoate(dead link) Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Organophosphate insecticides Category:Phosphorodithioates Category:Carboxamides ",
