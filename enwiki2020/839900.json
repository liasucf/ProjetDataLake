    "text": "In mathematics, a near-ring (also near ring or nearring) is an algebraic structure similar to a ring but satisfying fewer axioms. Near-rings arise naturally from functions on groups. == Definition == A set N together with two binary operations + (called addition) and \u22c5 (called multiplication) is called a (right) near-ring if: :A1: N is a group (not necessarily abelian) under addition; :A2: multiplication is associative (so N is a semigroup under multiplication); and :A3: multiplication on the right distributes over addition: for any x, y, z in N, it holds that (x + y)\u22c5z = (x\u22c5z) + (y\u22c5z).G. Pilz, (1982), \"Near-Rings: What They Are and What They Are Good For\" in Contemp. Math., 9, pp. 97\u2013119. Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, R.I., 1981. Similarly, it is possible to define a left near-ring by replacing the right distributive law A3 by the corresponding left distributive law. Both right and left near-rings occur in the literature; for instance, the book of PilzG. Pilz, \"Near-rings, the Theory and its Applications\", North-Holland, Amsterdam, 2nd edition, (1983). uses right near-rings, while the book of ClayJ. Clay, \"Nearrings: Geneses and applications\", Oxford, (1992). uses left near-rings. An immediate consequence of this one-sided distributive law is that it is true that 0\u22c5x = 0 but it is not necessarily true that x\u22c50 = 0 for any x in N. Another immediate consequence is that (\u2212x)\u22c5y = \u2212(x\u22c5y) for any x, y in N, but it is not necessary that x\u22c5(\u2212y) = \u2212(x\u22c5y). A near-ring is a ring (not necessarily with unity) if and only if addition is commutative and multiplication is also distributive over addition on the left. If the near- ring has a multiplicative identity, then distributivity on both sides is sufficient, and commutativity of addition follows automatically. == Mappings from a group to itself == Let G be a group, written additively but not necessarily abelian, and let M(G) be the set {f | f : G \u2192 G} of all functions from G to G. An addition operation can be defined on M(G): given f, g in M(G), then the mapping f + g from G to G is given by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) for all x in G. Then (M(G), +) is also a group, which is abelian if and only if G is abelian. Taking the composition of mappings as the product \u22c5, M(G) becomes a near-ring. The 0 element of the near-ring M(G) is the zero map, i.e., the mapping which takes every element of G to the identity element of G. The additive inverse \u2212f of f in M(G) coincides with the natural pointwise definition, that is, (\u2212f)(x) = \u2212(f(x)) for all x in G. If G has at least 2 elements, M(G) is not a ring, even if G is abelian. (Consider a constant mapping g from G to a fixed element g \u2260 0 of G; then g\u22c50 = g \u2260 0.) However, there is a subset E(G) of M(G) consisting of all group endomorphisms of G, that is, all maps f : G \u2192 G such that f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y in G. If (G, +) is abelian, both near-ring operations on M(G) are closed on E(G), and (E(G), +, \u22c5) is a ring. If (G, +) is nonabelian, E(G) is generally not closed under the near-ring operations; but the closure of E(G) under the near- ring operations is a near-ring. Many subsets of M(G) form interesting and useful near-rings. For example: *The mappings for which f(0) = 0. *The constant mappings, i.e., those that map every element of the group to one fixed element. *The set of maps generated by addition and negation from the endomorphisms of the group (the \"additive closure\" of the set of endomorphisms). If G is abelian then the set of endomorphisms is already additively closed, so that the additive closure is just the set of endomorphisms of G, and it forms not just a near-ring, but a ring. Further examples occur if the group has further structure, for example: *The continuous mappings in a topological group. *The polynomial functions on a ring with identity under addition and polynomial composition. *The affine maps in a vector space. Every near-ring is isomorphic to a subnear-ring of M(G) for some G. == Applications == Many applications involve the subclass of near- rings known as near-fields; for these see the article on near-fields. There are various applications of proper near-rings, i.e., those that are neither rings nor near-fields. The best known is to balanced incomplete block designs using planar near-rings. These are a way to obtain difference families using the orbits of a fixed point free automorphism group of a group. Clay and others have extended these ideas to more general geometrical constructions. ==See also== * Near-field (mathematics) * Semiring * Near-semiring ==References== * ==External links== * The Near Ring Main Page at the Johannes Kepler Universit\u00e4t Linz Category:Abstract algebra ",
