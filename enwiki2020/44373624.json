    "text": "United Arab Republic v Sudan was the decisive match of group stage at the 1959 African Cup of Nations. The match was played at the Prince Farouk Stadium in Cairo on 29 May 1959. Unlike other Africa Cup of Nations, the 1959 winner was determined by a final group stage, with the final three teams playing in round-robin format, instead of a knockout stage. This was the first edition to feature a final group stage and one of two, alongside the 1976 African Cup of Nations, to promote this format. Each team had defeated Ethiopia but the goal difference was in favor of United Arab Republic, who had beaten Ethiopia 4-0 while Sudan had won 1-0. Therefore, Sudan needed to win the last match to claim the title of champions of Africa; any other result would have the United Arab Republic retain the title they had won (as Egypt) in 1957. United Arab Republic beat Sudan 2\u22121, therefore keeping first place in the group and winning their second consecutive title. ==Background== The road to the title in the 1959 Africa Cup of Nations was unique, with a round-robin group instead of a knockout stage. The three competition teams were United Arab Republic (host country), Sudan and Ethiopia. United Arab Republic and Sudan won their matches against Ethiopia, United Arab Republic by 4\u20130 to top the group, ahead of Sudan who won by 1\u20130.http://www.koorasudan.net/vb/showthread.php?t=77400 ==Match== ===Match details=== {| style=\"width:92%;\" |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%;\" |- | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK || ' || Adel Hekal |- |RB || ' || Tarek Selim |- |CB || ' || Yaken Hussein |- |CB || ' || Rifaat El-Fanagily |- |LB || ' || Taha Ismail |- |RM || ' || Mimi El-Sherbini |- |CM || ' || Mahmoud El-Gohary |- |CM || ' || Sherif El-Far |- |LM || ' || Saleh Selim |- |CF || ' || Essam Baheeg |- |CF || ' || Alaa El-Hamouly |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| P\u00e1l Titkos |} | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto;\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK || ' || Samir Mohammed Ali |- |RB || ' || Ahmed Mutawakil Mohammed El-Bashir |- |CB || ' || Hassan Mohammed Al-Abd |- |LB || ' || Ibrahim Mohammed Ali 'Ibrahim El- Kabir' |- |RH || ' || Abbas Al-Hedi Syam |- |LH || ' || Suleiman Difalla Al- Mahina |- |OR || ' || Mahmoud Abd Zoubeir |- |IR || ' || Bora\u00ee Bashir |- |CF || ' || Mutalib Abdel-Nasser 'Drissa' |- |IL || ' || Siddiq Manzul |- |OL || ' || Abdullah Wahaga |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Josef Hada |} |} ==Aftermath== ==References== Final 1 Africa Cup of Nations Final Category:Egypt national football team matches Category:Sudan national football team matches Category:1950s in Cairo Category:Sports competitions in Cairo Category:Football in Cairo Category:May 1959 sports events ",
