The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 22 September 1983. ==History== The Hudson River Lumber Company donated a tract of land to the City of DeRidder.

May 18, 2018: The jail has now been renovated to some degree and is open for tours to the public during weekdays and there are special lantern tours at night on occasion, as well as a haunted house around Halloween each year.

Thus, it is no longer lighted and/or usable by anyone. ==Notoriety== A trial that ended in two hangings in the Beauregard Parish Jail took place at the courthouse.
