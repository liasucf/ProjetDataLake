    "text": "The Squawkin' Hawk is a Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on August 8, 1942, and is the first to star the young Henery Hawk. ==Plot== Junior wants a chicken for dinner, saying that he is a chicken hawk. His mother insists he eat a worm, or he will get no supper. Junior refuses, much to the worm's relief. Junior's mother puts him to bed and tells him to \"go right to sleep\". Henery sneaks out his house at bedtime, then goes to the chickenhouse and soon finds a rooster and his hen, Hazel, who has a panic reaction at the sound of the words \"chicken hawk\". The rooster chases him until his mother spots him and sends him home. He is again told to eat a worm and again refuses and says he wants a \"chicken\", at which point the worm gives him a big kiss on the beak. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1942 films Category:1942 animated films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:Short films directed by Chuck Jones Category:1940s American animated films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about birds Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ",
