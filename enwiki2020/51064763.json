Although her father\u2019s absence has taken a toll on her personality, she pretends to belong to a happy family in front of her love interest, Haider. This camouflage is far from reality, but she has built this cover story over the years to avoid speculations.

At this point, Sundus\u2019s parents, Tehreem and Ehtishaam, get in touch after years of separation and decide to live together for a few months to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of a happy family\u2014 deciding that they will move on with their own lives after their daughter\u2019s wedding.
