    "text": "Location of Mira and neighbouring states Relief of King Tarkasnawa of Mira at Karabel Mira was a vassal state of the Hittite empire in the second half of the second millennium BC. It was part of the Arzawa lands in western Asia Minor. == Location == According to the current understanding, Mira's northern border with the was marked by the Karabel relief. This was first proposed in 1975 by Hans Gustav G\u00fcterbock and confirmed by John David Hawkins decipherment of the inscription on the relief in 1998.J. David Hawkins, \"Tarkasnawa, King of Mira: 'Tarkondemos', Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y sealings and Karabel,\" Anatolian Studies 48, 1998, pp. 1\u201331. The southern border with the Lukka lands was probably at Milas, while the eastern border with the Hittite kingdom may have been somewhere around Afyon.Horst Ehringhaus: G\u00f6tter, Herrscher, Inschriften - Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Gro\u00dfreichszeit in der T\u00fcrkei, von Zabern 2005 p. 91 Borders with other territories, like Pita\u0161\u0161a, Ma\u0161a, and the kingdom of Arzawa are only attested in limited time periods. Mira was the closest of the Arzawa lands to the Hittite kingdom.Susanne Heinhold-Krahmer: Mira in Erich Ebeling, Bruno Meissner, Dietz-Otto Edzard: Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Arch\u00e4ologie, Walter de Gruyter, 1997 pp. 218\u2013220 Google Books == History== The earliest reference to Mira is connected to the Arzawa campaign of the Hittite Great King \u0160uppiluliuma I in the 14th century BC, but it is unclear whether Mira was one of the opponents of the Great King, or what its relationship to Arzawa was. \u0160uppiluliuma's daughter, Muwatti was married to Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa, who came from the Arzawa lands. After the successful conclusion of the Arzawa campaign by \u0160uppiluliuma's son and successor Mur\u0161ili II, Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa was installed in Mira as a vassal ruler and granted 600 men as a personal guard. How much of the area of the former Arzawa lands were encompassed by Mira is not clear. It is probable that Mira extended to the Aegean coast and had its capital at Apa\u0161a (probably Ephesus).Charles Allen Burney: Historical dictionary of the Hittites. Scarecrow Press, 2004 S. 202 Google Books Soon after, Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa was convicted of perjury, stirred up the land of Pita\u0161\u0161a against the Hittites, and fled to the land of Ma\u0161a. Mur\u0161ili II threatened to invade Ma\u0161a and thus Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa was handed over to him, whereupon he was deported to Hattusa. By agreement with 'the Great men' of Mira, Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa's successor was his nephew and adopted son, Kupanta- Runtiya.Horst Klengel: Geschichte des hethitischen Reiches. Brill 1999 p. 194 bei GoogleBooks During the reign of \u1e2aattu\u0161ili III in the 13th century BC, there seem to have been disagreements between the Hittites and the king of Mira (probably Kupanta-Runtiya), because of the latter's support for the Ur\u1e2bi- Te\u0161\u0161up, whom \u1e2aattu\u0161ili had ousted. Whether this led to war between Mira and the Hittites is not clear. The last known reference to Mira is in the treaty of Tud\u1e2baliya IV with his cousin or uncle Kurunta of Tar\u1e2bunta\u0161\u0161a, late in the 13th century BC, in which a king of Mira with the name of Alantalli is named as a witness to the treaty. === Kings=== * Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa (ca. 1330\u20131300 BC; Luwian: 'Mouse'); married Muwatti, the sister of Mursili II. * Kupanataruntiya (Kupantakurunta; ca. 1300\u20131250/40 BC); nephew and adopted son of Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa. * Alantalli (after 1259 \u2013 after 1236 v. Chr.) * Tarkasnawa (until some time after 1220 BC; Luwian: 'Ass'); son of Alantalli * Ma\u0161\u1e2buitta or Par\u1e2buitta (Reading uncertain; after 1220 BC) == Testimonies == In the Suratkaya inscription, a 'Great prince' Kupantakurunta is named, who is most likely the son of Ma\u0161\u1e2builuwa. The reference to Mira in the inscription is an indication that the land extended at least to the eastern part of the Be\u015fparmak Mountains. Mira is mentioned in around twenty, mostly fragmentary, cuneiform tablets found at Bo\u011fazkale (\u1e2aattu\u0161a) from the 14th and 13th centuries BC. In the Karabel relief, a king of Mira named Tarkasnawa is depicted. The Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription on the relief reads: The name Tarkasnawa also appears on a silver seal and in seal impressions from Hattusa, where the name was previously read as Tarkondemos. == References == ==Bibliography== * Frank Starke: Mir\u0101.
