    "text": "The Pacific International Cup (PIC) is an international bonspiel held annually in April at the Richmond Curling Club in Richmond, British Columbia. The objective of the PIC is to promote and develop curling at a grass-roots level both in British Columbia and internationally by providing club teams an opportunity to play in a premier international tournament. Over the years teams from 23 different countries and US states have participated in the bonspiel, including from China, Chinese Taipei, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Singapore. The PIC invites 16 men's teams and 16 women's teams, 13 each from outside of British Columbia (Yukon and international) and the top 3 teams from the BC Club Challenge Championship. == History == Originally called the Pacific Club Challenge, the inaugural event was held in 1999 at the Royal City Curling Club in New Westminster, British Columbia. At that time it was only open to the men's club champions from the Lower Mainlands division of the Pacific Coast Curling Association (one of the precursors to the current Curl BC association). Over time the club challenge was opened to all of the Pacific Coast Curling Association (and subsequently Curl BC) and acted as a provincial club championship. In 2019 the BC Club Challenge became a separate event where club champions from each curling club in the province have a chance to become provincial club champion and represent British Columbia at the national Travelers Curling Club Championship. The top 3 men's and women's teams in the BC Club Challenge Championship gain entry into the Pacific International Cup. In 2000 the bonspiel expanded to include international and Yukon teams and in 2004 added a women's division. From 2012 to 2018 both men's and women's had two pools, the international pool and the British Columbia pool which acted as the provincial club challenge championship. The winners of each pool would then play each other to become the men's and women's overall PIC champions. In March, 2019 Curling Canada honoured the organizers of the Pacific International Cup with the prestigious Award of Achievement in recognition of the event's impact on curling. The 2020 PIC was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Champions == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Men's Champions !Year !Winning Team !Winning Team's Club/Locale |- |2000 |Fred Puetz, Ian Turner, Marc Fillion, Dennis Robertson |Salmon Arm CC, Salmon Arm, BC |- |2001 |Cal Fister, Murray Day, Scott Gregory, Cary Blackburn |Golden Ears CC, Maple Ridge, BC |- |2002 |Jared Wannamaker, Kevan Penonzek, Ken Johnson, Cameron Johnston, Dwayne Clegg |Gibsons CC, Gibsons, BC |- |2003 |Brian Gessner, Tom Lutes, Lawrence Layton, Jim Graham |Vancouver CC, Vancouver, BC |- |2004 |Bob Chlan, Jeff MacPheat, Harold Levesque, Duke Lecuyer, Bert Levesque |Nanaimo CC, Nanaimo, BC |- |2005 |Gerald Poelman, Randy Thiessen, Craig Burton, Jim Machell, Stuart Procter |Duncan CC, Duncan, BC |- |2006 |Cal Fister, Cary Blackburn, Brent Kupser, Don Wakefield |Golden Ears CC, Maple Ridge, BC |- |2007 |Stu Harris, Dean Lunn, Don Nahnybida, Mario Pimentel |Valley CC |- |2008 |Cal Fister, Garth Moore, Murray Day, Brian Williams |Golden Ears CC, Maple Ridge, BC |- |2009 |Kevin Geistlinger, Darin Heath, Kevin Pickering, Dan Colton |Vernon CC, Vernon, BC |- |2010 |Stu Harris, Dean Lunn, Todd O'Dell, Bob Crocker |Cloverdale CC, Cloverdale, BC |- |2011 |Dwight Hodder, Paul Quesnel, Gary Farr, Cheyne Hodder |Ashcroft CC, Ashcroft, BC |- |2012 |Randie Shen, Brendon Liu, Nick Hsu, Steve Koo, Ken Chung |Chinese Taipei |- |2013 |Blaine Black, Shaun Everest, Doug McCrae, Kim Dixon |Penticton CC, Penticton, BC |- |2014 |Darren Frycz, Steve Claxton, Don Monk, Bill Nickerson |Langley CC, Langley, BC |- |2015 |Kevin Britz, Ken Britz, James Crawford, Darren Jarvis |Chilliwack CC, Chilliwack, BC |- |2016 |Ron Schmidt, Norm Cot\u00e9, Craig Bernes, Darren Richards |Comox Valley CC, Courtenay, BC |- |2017 |John Shoesmith, Andrew Ernst, Ed Strachan, John Harrison |Washington, USA |- |2018 |Vic Shimizu, Cody Tanaka, Trevor Bakken, Mark Yodogawa |Richmond CC, Richmond, BC |- |2019 |Ron Schmidt, Norm Cot\u00e9, Mike Meeres, Darren Richards |Comox Valley CC, Courtenay, BC |- |2020 | colspan=\"2\" |Cancelled |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Women's Champions !Year !Winning Team !Winning Team's Club/Locale |- |2004 |Leanne Andrews, Jennifer Gay, Susan Milum, Carolyn Brand |Valley CC |- |2005 |Nancy Richard, Clare Cloutier, Leslie Frosch, Doreen Deaver, Miyo Konno |Washington, USA |- |2006 |Bingyu Wang, Qingshuang Yue, Yin Liu, Yan Zhou, Yue Sun |China |- |2007 |Shellan Reed, Dianne Gauthier, Cynthia Parton, Deanna Kersey |Royal City CC, New Westminster, BC |- |2008 |Marilou Richter, Marnie Jepsen, Debbie Jones- Walker, Dianne Gauthier, Sandra Comadina |Royal City CC, New Westminster, BC |- |2009 |Lil Blashko, Cindy Curtain, Sandy Heath, Tammy Brennan |Penticton CC, Penticton, BC |- |2010 |Cory McLaughlin, Corri Roberts, Danielle Callens, Crystal Murray |Cloverdale CC, Cloverdale, BC |- |2011 |Deb Goodwin, Lonnie Schopp, Kim Jonsson, Lori Ross |Comox Valley CC, Courtenay, BC |- |2012 |Deb Goodwin, Lonnie Schopp, Kim Jonsson, Lori Ross |Comox Valley CC, Courtenay, BC |- |2013 |Amy Gibson, Rebecca Turley, Carman Cheng, Michelle Dunn |Vancouver CC, Vancouver, BC |- |2014 |Cathy Shuttleworth, Vicky Persinger, Catharine Persinger, Adie Callahan |Alaska, USA |- |2015 |Leanne Andrews, Jenn Gay, Kim Mclandress, Philippa Johnston |Cloverdale CC, Cloverdale, BC |- |2016 |Cora Farrell, Kelly Snider, Erica Blake, Karen Spaleta |Alaska, USA |- |2017 |Kim Dennis, Heather Beatty, Dawn Mesana, Jenn Gauthier |Richmond CC, Richmond, BC |- |2018 |Lori Olsen, Kelsey Martin, Lisa Robitaille, Andrea Bourassa |McArthur Island CC, Kamloops, BC |- |2019 |Peggy Dorosz, Laini Klassen,Kandice Braga, Inge Brown |Yukon |- |2020 | colspan=\"2\" |Cancelled |} == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Curling in British Columbia Category:Curling competitions in Canada Category:International curling competitions hosted by Canada Category:Sports competitions in British Columbia ",
