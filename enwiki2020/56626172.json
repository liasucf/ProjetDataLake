Most of his work is comic, and was once a member of the Brazilian TV Pirata comedy show, one of the greatest hits of humor, screened by Globo TV. His most prominent work on TV is Butler Porf\u00edrio in telenovela Meu Bem, Meu Mal. ===Disease=== On April 29, 2005, he was robbed in a taxi, with his purse stolen. Karam physically suffered nothing, but the taxi driver was killed by reacting. Apparently, since the time of the assault Karam began to manifest symptoms of Machado-Joseph disease, a degenerative syndrome, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, which compromises motor coordination and control over muscles. Forced to switch to a wheelchair to get around, he has since stayed away from the stage and television. According to his father, Alfredo Karam, who gave statements to the Rio newspaper Extra, he inherited the illness of his mother, who died due to this same genetic anomaly. The other three brothers of the actor have already presented the disease - two already died. ===Death=== The actor died on July 7, 2016, at the Hospital Naval Marc\u00edlio Dias,Morre, aos 58 anos, o ator Guilherme Karam.
