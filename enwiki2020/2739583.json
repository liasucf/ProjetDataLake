Omega Phi Alpha, also known as OPhiA or OPA, currently has thirty active chapters in the United States. ==Purpose== The purpose of Omega Phi Alpha reads as follows: :The purpose and goals of this sorority shall be to assemble its members in the fellowship of Omega Phi Alpha, to develop friendship, leadership, and cooperation by promoting service to the university community, to the community-at-large, to the members of the sorority, and to the nations of the world. ==History== In 1953, the Zeta Kappa chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity, expressed interest in forming a group much like theirs to help them in their service endeavors. The brothers of Zeta Kappa formed interest groups for a new organization, and many of the attendees at these interest groups were women. The need for a female service sorority then became evident. The two groups were to be alike in objectives\u2014friendship, leadership, and service. A similar name\u2014Omega Phi Alpha\u2014was chosen for the new organization. Just as the Alpha Phi Omega chapter was limited to former Boy Scouts, the Omega Phi Alpha chapter was originally limited to former Girl Scouts and Campfire Girls.Spring 2006 Chevron p4 This limitation continued until 1958. Two more Omega Phi Alpha groups were formed at Eastern Michigan University and the University of Bridgeport in 1958 and 1962, respectively. All three groups had the intention of becoming a national sorority together; however, it would be five more years before national status was reached. In 1966, plans for a national convention, at which the three chapters could meet, were made. In the summer of 1967, the three groups met in Bowling Green for the first time and laid the foundations for what is currently Omega Phi Alpha. The Bowling Green group was given the title of Alpha chapter, University of Bridgeport became the Beta chapter, and Eastern Michigan was named the Gamma chapter. The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma chapters continued for several years as a national sorority until women at Texas A&M; University formed the Delta chapter in 1970. Currently, there are thirty-one active chapters of Omega Phi Alpha. Additionally, there are ten inactive chapters and eight alumnae chapters. ==Service program== Omega Phi Alpha has a diverse, flexible service program which allows each member to contribute to the world around her. Many chapters have ongoing projects that they have worked with for years. Six areas of service: 1\\. Permanent Project: The permanent project is mental health. Mental health service projects are defined as any project that improves the well being of others, and these projects are typically hands on projects such as playing with kids in an afterschool program, playing Bingo at a nursing home, or serving meals at a soup kitchen. 2\\. President's Project: Each year at Omega Phi Alpha National Convention, the National President of Omega Phi Alpha presents the cause she feels is worthy of being the focus of OPA service nationwide. :* 1968-1969: Mental health :* 1970-1971: Ecology :* 1973-1974: Elderly :* 1974-1975: Muscular dystrophy :* 1977-1978: Heart disease :* 1979-1980: International Year of the Child :* 1980-1981: Hands Across the Ages- Working with the Elderly :* 1982-1983: Girl Scouts of the USA :* 1983-1984: National Head Injury Foundation :* 1984-1985: Alcohol Awareness :* 1990-1991: Environment :* 1991-1992: Cultural diversity :* 1993-1994: AIDS education :* 1995-1996: Breast cancer :* 1996-1997: Ronald McDonald House :* 2002-2003: Girl Scouts of the USA :* 2003-2004: Alcohol abuse preventionPast Nu Service Projects/Alcohol Awareness Mu chapter Service :* 2004-2005: Support your sisterhood :* 2005-2006: Education2006 Service Manual p12 :* 2006-2007: Women's healthOmega Phi Alpha Convention 2007 Registration Info :* 2007-2008: Domestic violence awarenessStudent Organization of the Week: Omega Phi Alpha :* 2008-2009: Women's cancer awareness :* 2009-2010: Literacy :* 2010-2011: Money Management :* 2011-2012: Archiving OPAWinter 2012 Chevron :* 2012-2013: Community InclusionWinter 2013 Chevron :* 2013-2014: Empowering Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) :* 2014-2015: Physical Fitness and Healthy Living :* 2015-2016: Mental Health Matters :* 2016-2017: Chapter Choice :* 2017-2018: Childhood Obesity :* 2018-2019: Building Two Thousand Bridges :* 2019-2020: Literacy :* 2020-Present: Food Insecurity: Hunger in America :* Past President's projects prior to 2002 include the environment, terminal illness, AIDS awareness and education, domestic violence, \"Just Say No To Drugs\", handicapped children, nursing,Alpha Chapter Service ecology, heart disease, children, the elderly, head injury prevention, Literacy, and internal organization keypoints. 3\\.

The national conventions provide a forum for making sorority-wide decisions like aligning on a budget, electing national officers, or changing the national policies reflected in the constitution and by-laws. Each active chapter in good standing has two votes to use in deciding sorority issues. Active chapters who are not in good standing have only one vote. There are also alumnae delegates who represent each of OPA's four districts. For every three active votes, alumnae get one vote.
