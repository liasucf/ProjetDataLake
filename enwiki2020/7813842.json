KPRC is owned by iHeartMedia. The station's studios are located along the West Loop Freeway in the city's Uptown district. KPRC is powered at 5,000 watts. At night, to protect other stations on AM 950, it uses a directional antenna. The transmitter site is located off the Interstate 610 North Loop and Liberty Road in the Settegast neighborhood on the northeast side.Radio-Locator.com/KPRC KPRC is also heard on an HD Radio subchannel of sister station 94.5 KTBZ-FM-HD3. ==Programming== KPRC Previous Logo iHeartRadio owns two talk stations in Houston. KTRH has a slate of mostly local hosts and iHeart's top syndicated shows. KPRC's schedule was largely syndicated until some programming changes in late 2018 added several daytime shows to the lineup. Weekdays begin with Walton & Johnson (KPRC is the flagship station), followed by Glenn Beck, The STA Money Hour, Ken Webster Jr.'s \"Pursuit of Happiness\", The Jimmy Barrett Show, The Jesse Kelly Show, The Truth with Charles Adams and Buck Sexton.https://kprcradio.iheart.com/schedule/ Walton & Johnson, Beck, Kelly and Sexton are syndicated shows.

Until March 19, 2013, the station was branded The 950 - Radio Mojo, and aired a hot talk format. ==History== In 1923, Ross Sterling Jr. took a course on broadcasting at the YMCA in Houston. His father, Ross Sterling Sr., met the instructor, Alfred P. Daniel (of now-discontinued radio station WCAK), and discussed starting a new radio station affiliated with the Houston Post. William P. Hobby, the president and publisher of the Post, asked Sterling to launch the radio station. Before a 500-watt transmitter ordered from the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Co. arrived in Houston, Sterling Jr. died. Sterling Sr., mourning the loss of his son, put the still crated transmitter in storage. Over one year later, Daniel approached Sterling Sr. and asked about proceeding with the establishment of the radio station. Sterling Sr. agreed with the idea and moved forward with establishing the station. KPRC's first broadcast occurred on Saturday, May 9, 1925, with Daniel as the station's first announcer and program director. The federal license granting permission for radio broadcasts on 920 kHz was issued on May 13. Although the call letters stand for Post Radio Company, they also refer to a 1920s' Houston business/tourism campaign slogan Kotton (sic required by ITU prefix) Port Rail Center. (There is a similar situation with Houston radio station KHCB-FM.) In 1927, it interrupted its scheduled programming to give out dispatches for the Houston Police Department.History Of Houston Police Department In 1941, KPRC moved to its current frequency of 950 kHz under terms of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (or NARBA). On December 24, 1946, KPRC-FM (now KODA) signed on the air. In 1950, the Hobbys purchased KLEE-TV Channel 2 and renamed it KPRC-TV. In 1983, after the Post was sold, the Hobby family's broadcast holdings were reorganized into H&C; Communications. The Hobbys began to liquidate their broadcasting assets in 1993, selling KPRC radio to the Sunbelt Broadcasting Company, a local company that also bought KSEV (but unrelated to the similarly-named Nevada-based television station owner Sunbelt Communications Company [later the Intermountain West Communications Company; it is now defunct]). The Hobbys sold KPRC-TV to Post-Newsweek Stations the next year. Sunbelt, in turn, sold KPRC radio to its current owner, iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel Communications), in 1995. ==References== ==External links== *Official Site Previous KPRC Logo as of September 3, 2019 *FCC History Cards for KPRC Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1925 PRC (AM) Category:1925 establishments in Texas Category:IHeartMedia radio stations Category:Houston Astros broadcasters ",
