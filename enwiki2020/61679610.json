Dan Ozzi of Diffuser.fm ranked the song #8 on his list of the 10 best Misfits songs, writing that \"Like most Misfits songs, 'Attitude' doesn't even top two minutes, and really, there's not much to it. Danzig's message is pretty simple: Keep acting like an a--hole, and I'm gonna knock you out.\" Rob Kemp of Time Out has noted a reputation of \"Attitude\", among other Misfits songs, as being \"antiestablishment\" in nature. In his book This Music Leaves Stains: The Complete Story of the Misfits, author James Greene, Jr., in speaking of Guns N' Roses' cover of \"Attitude\" from their 1993 album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\", called \"Attitude\" a song that, \"more than any other Danzig work, seemed to provide the blueprint for both GNR's adrenaline-heavy sound and Axl Rose's temperamental stage persona\". ==Personnel== The Misfits * Glenn Danzig \u2013 vocals * Jerry Only \u2013 bass * Franch\u00e9 Coma \u2013 guitar * Mr. Jim \u2013 drums Production * Dave Achelis \u2013 engineer * Tom Bejgrowicz \u2013 producer ==Cover versions== In 1993, Guns N' Roses recorded a cover version of \"Attitude\" for their album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\", with bassist Duff McKagan performing the vocals.
