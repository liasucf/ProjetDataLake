    "text": "Dicks were an American punk rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 1980 and initially disbanded in 1986. Their music is considered influential in introducing the sound of hardcore punk, as well as incorporating blues rock influences into their sound. After the first breakup, singer Gary Floyd formed the band Sister Double Happiness, with drummer Lynn Perko, then later fronted a project called Black Kali Ma. In 2004, The Dicks reunited and were active until 2016. The Dicks went through two incarnations in the 1980s, changing its lineup when Floyd moved from Austin to San Francisco in 1983. As a political band with Marxist lyrics during the Reagan era, they did not shy from controversy. Floyd was one of a handful of openly gay musicians in the 1980s punk scene. ==History== ===Austin lineup (1980\u20131983)=== Dicks were formed in Austin in 1980 by Gary Floyd, Buxf Parrott, Pat Deason, and Glen Taylor. Their first single \"Dicks Hate The Police\", released in 1980, brought them much attention and is now regarded as a classic hardcore punk record.True, Christopher \"[ Dicks Biography]\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation In the song Floyd sings from the perspective of a policeman who abuses his power by targeting minorities and abusing civilians. Dicks often played shows with fellow pioneering Texas hardcore bands MDC, The Offenders, and The Big Boys; Dicks' full-length debut was the split album with The Big Boys, Live at Raul's Club. Dicks were among the first punk bands to address issues of homophobia and sexual identity, as in such songs as \"Saturday Night at the Bookstore\" and \"Off Duty Sailor\". ===San Francisco lineup (1983\u20131986)=== In 1983, Floyd left Texas for San Francisco along with Debbie Gordon, the band's manager, who was considered a member of the band. Floyd and Gordon, along with new members Tim Carroll, Sebastian Fuchs, and Lynn Perko (formerly of all-women band The Wrecks), formed a second version of Dicks. The LP Kill From The Heart was released in 1983 on SST Records and These People followed in 1985 on Alternative Tentacles. The group disbanded in 1986, although occasional one- off reunion shows featuring the Austin lineup occurred through the 1980s and 1990s. ===Breakup and continuing influence=== The band remained influential in punk and underground circuits. San Antonio's Butthole Surfers had ended their 1984 album Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac with the cowpunk anthem \"Gary Floyd\" in tribute to the Dicks' bandleader. Dicks saw a resurgence in popularity during the popularity of grunge when Seattle band Mudhoney released a cover of Dicks' \"Hate The Police\" on Sub Pop Records. Soon after, Chicago noise rockers The Jesus Lizard (three fourths of whom were also from Austin) released their cover version of Dicks' \"Wheelchair Epidemic\". Gary Floyd later started Sister Double Happiness in San Francisco in 1986.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 504-505 After that band ended he formed and primarily played in Europe with The Gary Floyd Band; an overview of this material, \"Backdoor Preacher Man\", is available in the United States. Toward the late 1990s, Floyd played in Black Kali Ma, who released an album on Alternative Tentacles. Floyd later formed the band the Buddha Brothers, while Parrott and Deason went on to play in the Austin neo-bluegrass band Shootin' Pains and Trouser Trout, while Parrott and Taylor also played in Pretty Mouth. Perko went on to join Imperial Teen.Beets, Greg \"The Dicks\", Austin Chronicle ===Reunion (2004\u20132016)=== In 2004, Dicks began playing regular reunion concerts in Austin and elsewhere. The lineup for the shows consists of the original Dicks, with the exception of Glen Taylor, who died in 1997. His role was filled by three other Austin guitarists: Mark Kenyon, Brian McGee, and Davy Jones. At the 2009 Austin Music Awards show, Jesus Lizard singer David Yow joined the band onstage for \"Wheelchair Epidemic\". At the same show, Dicks were inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame.\"Austin Music Awards 2009-2009 Hall of Fame\", Austin Chronicle A documentary film, The Dicks From Texas was released in 2015 about the Dicks and Austin, Texas punk scene along with a tribute album, The Dicks From Texas and Friends, with 27 bands covering 28 Dicks songs. The Dicks announced that their final show would be October 30, 2016 at Grizzly Hall in Austin, Texas, however due to popular demand, a second show was added the day afterward. ==Members== * Gary Floyd \u2013 vocals (1980\u20131986, 2004\u20132016) * Buxf Parrott \u2013 bass, guitar, vocals (1980\u20131983, 2004\u20132016) * Pat Deason \u2013 drums (1980\u20131983, 2004\u20132016) * Glen Taylor (deceased) \u2013 guitar, bass (1980\u20131983), died 1997 * Debbie Gordon \u2013 manager (1982\u20131986) * Tim Carroll \u2013 guitar (1983\u20131986) * Lynn Perko \u2013 drums (1983\u20131986) * Sebastian Fuchs \u2013 bass, vocals (1983\u20131986) * Mark Kenyon \u2013 guitar (2004\u20132016) * Brian Magee \u2013 guitar (2004\u20132005, 2016) * Davy Jones (deceased) \u2013 guitar (2005\u20132015), died 2015 Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:30 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1980 till:12/31/2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Manager value:yellow legend:Manager id:Album value:black legend:Studio albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1980 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1980 LineData = layer:back color:Album at:12/31/1980 at:12/31/1983 at:06/01/1985 BarData = bar:Floyd text:\"Gary Floyd\" bar:Taylor text:\"Glen Taylor\" bar:Carroll text:\"Tim Carroll\" bar:Kenyon text:\"Mark Kenyon\" bar:Magee text:\"Brian Magee\" bar:Jones text:\"Davy Jones\" bar:Parrott text:\"Buxf Parrott\" bar:Fuchs text:\"Sebastian Fuchs\" bar:Deason text:\"Pat Deason\" bar:Perko text:\"Lynn Perko\" bar:Gordon text:\"Debbie Gordon\" PlotData= width:11 bar:Floyd from:01/01/1980 till:12/31/1986 color:Vocals bar:Floyd from:01/01/2004 till:12/31/2016 color:Vocals bar:Taylor from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Guitar bar:Taylor from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Bass width:3 bar:Carroll from:06/01/1983 till:12/31/1986 color:Guitar bar:Kenyon from:01/01/2004 till:12/31/2016 color:Guitar bar:Magee from:01/01/2004 till:06/01/2005 color:Guitar bar:Magee from:01/01/2016 till:12/31/2016 color:Guitar bar:Jones from:06/01/2005 till:09/01/2015 color:Guitar bar:Parrott from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Guitar width:3 bar:Parrott from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Bass bar:Parrott from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Vocals width:7 bar:Parrott from:01/01/2004 till:12/31/2016 color:Bass bar:Parrott from:01/01/2004 till:12/31/2016 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Fuchs from:06/01/1983 till:12/31/1986 color:Bass bar:Fuchs from:06/01/1983 till:12/31/1986 color:Vocals width:3 bar:Deason from:01/01/1980 till:06/01/1983 color:Drums bar:Deason from:01/01/2004 till:12/31/2016 color:Drums bar:Perko from:06/01/1983 till:12/31/1986 color:Drums bar:Gordon from:06/01/1982 till:12/31/1986 color:Manager ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Kill from the Heart LP (1983), SST Records *These People LP (1985), Alternative Tentacles ===10\"=== *Ten Inches 10\" (2006), Delta Pop Music ===Lives=== *Live at Raul's Club LP (1980), Rat Race \u2013 Split with The Big Boys *Dicks Live!
