She was the eldest of four children of Thomas Reid, publican, and Anne Reid (n\u00e9e Downey). The family home was above their pub in Drogheda, with the family also owning a number of properties in the town and in Dublin. Reid attended school at the Siena Convent, where her talent for painting developed. Upon leaving school she initially enrolled to train as a nurse at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, but left after two months. Her parents were persuaded by their parish priest, Dr Segrave, to allow Reid to attend the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. Whilst there she became an acquaintance of Harry Clarke. Reid taught in at her old school and a boys' school in Drogheda in 1923. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1925 with three illustrations of poems. Reid exhibited with the RHA periodically until 1968, though never became an academic member. In 1927, as was common with other Irish painters of the time, Reid went to Paris. Whilst there, she attended to the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re for a few months, but the experience doesn't appear to have had an influence on her painting style. She then went to London to attend the Chelsea Polytechnic from 1929 to 1930, which she did not enjoy and after that remained in Ireland. ==Artistic career== After returning to Ireland, Reid began to exhibit landscape painting at the RHA. Like other painters of the period, such as Paul Henry, she travelled to the west of Ireland for painting inspiration with her early work showing the landscapes, local people and fisherman of the area. In 1934, she held a solo show at the Society of Dublin Painters at St Stephen's Green. Her second solo show was in 1936 at the Daniel Egan Gallery in Dublin, the show consisted of 53 watercolours and 23 oil paintings. At the request of the Drogheda mayor, the collection was rehung in the town. Reid's sister had taken over the family pub, to which Reid was a regular visitor while living primarily in Dublin. In Dublin she shared a house with her friend Patricia Hutchins. There was gossip about the nature of the women's relationship, but Hutchins went on to marry. After WWII, Reid moved to Fitzwilliam Square, taking in young men as lodgers, including Pearse Hutchinson. In 1950, Reid and Norah McGuinness were selected to represent Ireland at the Venice Biennale of Art. This was the first time Irish artists participated in this international exhibition, which has been supported by the government of Ireland since then through a range of departments and agencies responsible for foreign affairs, arts and culture. ==Work in collections== * Crawford Art Gallery, Cork * Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda * Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin * Trinity College Dublin * The Arts Council of Ireland including ** Cave of the Firbola ** Wreckage No.1 * Santa Barbara Museum California * Irish Institute, New York * University of Limerick, IACI O'Malley Collection (1) Donkeys on the Aran Shore, (2) Valley Desmond, Gaugan Barra ==Quotes== * A born artist and a born stylist...This young artist from Drogheda has to be saluted as a genius. ** Thomas MacGreevy, The Irish Times, 27 November 1942, p. 3 link * One can say, without pretension, that she has her place in European painting. ** Patrick Swift, Envoy, March 1950 (read article).
