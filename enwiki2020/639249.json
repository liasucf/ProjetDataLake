The most common design for the triens featured the bust of Minerva and four pellets (indicating four unciae) on the obverse and the prow of a galley on the reverse. It was not a common denomination and was last struck c. 89 BC. Later, in Frankish Gaul, the term \"triens\" was often used for the tremissis, since both terms meant \"a third\". ==See also== *Roman currency Category:Coins of ancient Rome ",
