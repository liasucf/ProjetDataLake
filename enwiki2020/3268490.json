    "text": "The University of South Australia Student Association (USASA), provides democratic student representation and vital services including advocacy, student clubs, second-hand books, social events, student magazine and campus counters to the student community at the University of South Australia (UniSA).http://usasa.sa.edu.au/About USASA is spread across the University of South Australia's four metropolitan campuses as well as the Centre for Regional Engagement, encompassing the Whyalla and Mount Gambier campuses. ==History== From 1 January 1991 the University of South Australia was established as a result of a merger between the Institute of Technology and significant elements of the South Australian College of Advanced Education.History of UniSA This merger necessitated the formation of a single student association that represented the needs of the then six campuses of the newly formed university. The New University Merger Discussion Group was the beginning of the UniSA Students Association (USASA). USASA was inaugurated in 1994, with the Confederated Student Union, the South Australian Institute of Technology Union and the Council of South Australian College Student Organisations managing the intervening years. When the Howard Government introduced Voluntary Student Unionism (VSU) in 2006,Government Senators' Dissenting Report USASA had to restructure to cope with the dramatic loss of income. Part of this restructure included rebranding the University of South Australia's student association as 'UniLife'. In 2013, the student association went back to their roots after a referendum of students overwhelmingly voted to officially rebrand the organisation as the 'University of South Australia Student Association'. This marked a time of restructure and renewed focus on student representation.http://unione.unilife.edu.au/Common/News.aspx?NID=435 ==Structure== USASA is a democratic organisation run by students that is responsive to student needs. USASA provides opportunities for students to become involved in the decision-making process at the central level and their local campus level through branch committees. USASA has established a number of standing committees that deal with specific areas of student concern. These standing committees include the Education Standing Committee, the Equity and Welfare Standing Committee, and the Services Standing Committee. ===USASA Board=== The overarching policies of the student association are set by the USASA Board. This is composed of students elected by and from the student population. The composition of the USASA Board and its powers and responsibilities are set out in the USASA Constitution.UniLife Constitution ===Staff=== USASA employs over 15 permanent, temporary, and casual staff. Representation and student service delivery provided by USASA is coordinated from the City West Campus head office and assisted by campus counters on each metropolitan campus. USASA employees perform a range of roles and either directly provide student services or support student representatives and club organisers to carry out their roles. ==Student Services== USASA's main objectives are to be an effective voice for representing students, ensure that students receive support regarding their rights and responsibilities and understand University policies and procedures and contribute to a campus culture where students have fun, make friends and take pride in their University.http://usasa.sa.edu.au/About ===Academic Advocacy=== USASA Advocates provide free and confidential advice on a wide range of academic problems. Common issues advocates assist with include requests for remarking/re-submissions, appeals against allegations of academic misconduct, appeals against final grades, appeals against intention to preclude, issues with lecturers and more.http://usasa.sa.edu.au/advocacy ===Second-hand Textbooks=== USASA's second hand textbook service sells books on behalf of students. Books are accepted on a consignment basis. When a book is bought or sold with the service, the book and the money directly goes to, or comes from, another student. ===Student Clubs=== USASA supports over 90 social, special interest, cultural and academic clubs. USASA pays homage to club activities throughout the year by holding the USASA Awards Night. ===Campus Counters=== USASA Campus Counters are located on all four metropolitan campuses and are run by student staff.

UniSA purchased the \"Rapture\" nightclub building situated at 58-60 North Terrace to be refurbished into a student lounge in 2009. This was opened for casual student use in Study Period 2, 2009.Entropy Magazine 1605, July 2008 Notable events held at the venue included the National Campus Band Comp, National Campus Art Prize Finals Exhibition and an exclusive Sundance Kids gig organised by UniSA CareerShop. Over the summer of 2011\u201312, the UniSA student lounge underwent major renovations to become an official Adelaide Fringe 2012 venue called \"The Grand Academy of Lagado\". The Grand Opening Party on 24 February 2012 attracted over 1700 patrons with live music, art, cabaret and comedy events spanning the 3-week Fringe period. During the 2012-13 study break the University failed to renew the lease of the student bar and now directly controls operations. This takeover caused another name change and the bar is currently called 'West Bar' and is not open to the public. ==Student Media== ===Verse Magazine=== Verse Magazine is a student-run magazine, published six times a year and distributed around UniSA campuses.
