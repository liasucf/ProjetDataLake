However, a recipe for \"Hopping John\" in The Carolina Housewife by Sarah Rutledge, which was published in 1847, is also cited as the earliest reference. An even earlier source is Recollections of a Southern Matron, which mentions \"Hopping John\" (defined, in a note, as \"bacon and rice\") as early as 1838. The origins of the name are uncertain; one possibility is that the name is a corruption of the Haitian Creole term for black-eyed peas: pois pigeons (), or \"pigeon peas\" in English. ==History== Hoppin' John was originally a Lowcountry food before spreading to the entire population of the South. Hoppin' John may have evolved from rice and bean mixtures that were the subsistence of enslaved West Africans en route to the Americas. Hoppin' John has been further traced to similar foods in West Africa, in particular the Senegalese dish thiebou niebe. One tradition common in the United States is that each person at the meal should leave three peas on their plate to ensure that the New Year will be filled with luck, fortune and romance. Another tradition holds that counting the number of peas in a serving predicts the amount of luck (or wealth) that the diner will have in the coming year. On Sapelo Island in the community of Hog Hammock, Geechee red peas are used instead of black-eyed peas. Sea Island red peas are similar.The pea that could; Geechee red peas from Sapelo Island offer new hope for a community by John T.

He has worked with farmers to re-introduce this variety of rice. As of 2017, several rice growers offer Carolina gold rice.Charlie Rose Interview, Episode 129, Season 20 == Variants == Other bean and rice dishes are seen throughout the American South and the Caribbean, and are often associated with African culinary influence in the Americas.
