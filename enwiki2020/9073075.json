The current baron, the 5th Baron Delamere, paints a picture of his early-19th century ancestor with deft, harsh strokes: :\"[The 1st Baron Delamere] was an idiot who decided it would be impressive to have a peerage. He thought he had a bargain when he paid 5,000 for it. The only problem was that the going rate was 1,200. Before he came along we had been content to be shire knights in Cheshire, when William the Conqueror gave us the whole county.\"Wright, Rupert \"The Kennedys of Kenya,\" The Spectator (London). 11 April 1998. ==Family== On 17 December 1810, Cholmondeley married Henrietta Elizabeth Williams-Wynn, daughter of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet, and Charlotte Grenville.
