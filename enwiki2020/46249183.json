Dubourg was born in Paris and trained with Fanny Ch\u00e9ron, copying old masters such as Willem Kalf in the Louvre.Victoria Dubourg in the RKD There she met the painter Henri Fantin-Latour, whom she married in 1876. She collaborated with him on floral paintings, but also produced works under her own name that she signed \"V Dubourg\". Dubourg has been critiqued as an artist whose work lacks originality, simply reproducing the styles of her well known husband. However, a careful review of her early work shows that Dubourg began producing still life two years prior to meeting Fantin-Latour.
