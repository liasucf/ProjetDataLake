    "text": "The refresh rate is the number of times in a second that a display hardware updates its buffer. It is not to be confused with the touch response rate, which is the frequency that the touchscreen senses input, or the frame rate, which describes how many images are stored or generated every second by the device driving the display. 60 Hz screens are typical for mobile devices; the first commercially available smartphone with a refresh rate greater than 60 Hz was the Razer Phone, released in November 2017. The following is a comparative list of smartphones which have a high refresh rate. {| style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Brand !
