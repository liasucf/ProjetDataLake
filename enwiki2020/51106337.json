    "text": "Pablo y Andrea is a Mexican children's telenovela produced by Lucero Su\u00e1rez for Televisa in 2005. Pablo y Andrea is an adaptation of the classic The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. The adventures are not developed on the coast of the Mississippi River, but in the magical town of Huasca de Ocampo in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. It was the last children's telenovela produced by Televisa, the lack of interest of the public with novels generated lower-rated audience. Scenes were cut from the original broadcast in order to reduce the 100 episodes to 75 because of the low ratings. On August 1, 2005, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting Pablo y Andrea weekdays at 4:00pm, replacing Sue\u00f1os y caramelos. The last episode was broadcast on November 11, 2005 with Peregrina replacing it. Ingrid Martz and Guillermo Capetillo starred as adult protagonists, Danna Paola and Jorge Trejo starred as young protagonists, while Mercedes Molto, Eduardo Rivera, Mar\u00eda Fernanda N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Adri\u00e1n Alonso, Valentina Cuenca and Geraldine Galv\u00e1n starred as antagonists. == Cast == *Ingrid Martz as Alma *Guillermo Capetillo as Juan Carlos Saavedra *Mercedes Molto as Carlota/\u00darsula/B\u00e1rbara/Socorro Barraza *Jorge Trejo as Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez *Danna Paola as Andrea Saavedra *Jes\u00fas Zavala as Nicol\u00e1s *Geraldine Galv\u00e1n as Hilda *Nadiedka as Mati *Rodrigo Llamas as Pepe *Valentina Cuenca as Rita *Valeria L\u00f3pez as Susana \"Susanita\" *Adri\u00e1n Alonso as Mart\u00edn Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez *Mar\u00eda Fernanda N\u00fa\u00f1ez as Diana *Marcia Couti\u00f1o as Carmen *Beng Zeng as Joaqu\u00edn *Carlos Espejel as Tob\u00edas *Zully Keith as Virginia Slater *Carol Sevilla as Nicole Slater *Juan Carlos Colombo as Sab\u00e1s *Nuria Bages as Gertrudis Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez *Eduardo Rivera as M\u00edkonos *Mario Casillas as Don Severino *Adalberto Parra as Quintero *Raquel Morell as Ellen Slater *Rodrigo Mej\u00eda as Rodrigo Castro *Jorge Ort\u00edn as Cirilo Frutos *Carlos Ignacio as Abelardo *Luis Gimeno as Don Cipriano Saavedra *Lupe V\u00e1zquez as Tiba *Loreli Mancilla as Laura *B\u00e1rbara G\u00f3mez as Concepci\u00f3n \"Conchita\" *Ren\u00e9 Azcoitia as Father Bonifacio *Anastasia as Paula *Alan Ledesma as Osvaldo *Rafael Perr\u00edn as Mateo *Luis Camarena as Anacleto *Jaime Lozano as Francisco \"Pancho\" Ort\u00edz *Luis Reynoso as Jes\u00fas *Thelma Tixou as Leonor *Arturo Lorca as Pielinsky *Juan Imperio as Moctezuma *Maripaz Garc\u00eda as To\u00f1a *Iliana de la Garza as Lupe *Javier Ru\u00e1n as Imanol *Bodokito as Chana == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; !
