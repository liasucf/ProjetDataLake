    "text": "Peracchi's nectar bat (Lonchophylla peracchii) is a species of nectar-feeding bat in the family Phyllostomidae. It was first described from the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. ==Description== The discovery of this species as distinct from Lonchophylla bokermanni has meant that the latter is restricted to a small area of the Cerrado, and might be endangered due to habitat destruction. Bat species in the genus Lonchophylla feed on nectar and differ from fruit-eating bats by having a long, extensible tongues and elongated skulls and muzzles, adapted to their feeding behaviour. L. peracchii is distinguished from L. bokermanni by its fur color and ear shape; the Cerrado species has a grayer hue and shorter, rounder ears. ==References== ==Further reading== *Teixeira, Tiago Souto Martins, et al. \"First record of Lonchophylla peracchii Dias, Esb\u00e9rard and Moratelli, 2013 (Chiroptera, Phyllostomidae) in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Southeastern Brazil.\" Oecologia Australis 17.3 (2013).
