    "text": "Charles Coolidge Haight (March 17, 1841 - February 9, 1917) was an American architect who practiced in New York City. He designed most of the buildings at Columbia College's now-demolished old campus on Madison Avenue, and designed numerous buildings at Yale University, many of which have survived (even though Yale's collegiate-gothic architecture is more often associated with the better known James Gamble Rogers). He designed the master plan and many of the buildings on the campus of the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea, New York, most of which have survived. Haight's architectural drawings and photographs are held in the Dept. of Drawings and Archives at the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City. ==Biography== Haight was born at New York City on March 17, 1841, the son of Rev. Benjamin I. Haight and his wife, Hetty Coolidge. He graduated from Columbia College in 1861, and studied law at Columbia until the outbreak of America's Civil War. In 1862, Haight enlisted at Baltimore with New York's Seventh Regiment, and then fought with the Thirty-first New York Volunteers. In 1864, he was wounded during the Battle of the Wilderness, after which he retired from military service.Obituary, Columbia Alumni News, 1917. After the war, Haight apprenticed with the architect Emlen T. Littel (1840\u201391) until 1867 when he opened his own office. In 1865, Haight married Euphemia Kneeland (1842\u20131909),The New York Times, September 20, 1865. with whom he had four children. He died at his home in Garrison, New York in 1917. ==Selected works== ===Buildings at Yale University=== * Vanderbilt Hall, Old Campus (completed 1894).Elizabeth Mills Brown, New Haven, a Guide to Architecture and Urban Design (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976). * Phelps Gate, Old Campus (completed 1895). * Phelps Hall, Old Campus (completed 1896).Montgomery Schuyler, \"The Work of Charles Coolidge Haight,\" The Architectural Record, July 1899. * Linsly Hall, now part of Linsly-Chittenden Hall, Old Campus (built 1906). * Vanderbilt Scientific Halls, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (completed 1906).Report of the Treasurer, Yale University, 1910, page 31. * Leet Oliver Memorial Hall (completed 1908). * Mason Laboratory, Sheffield Scientific School (completed 1911). * Sloane Physics Laboratory, Sheffield Scientific School (completed 1912). * St. Anthony Hall, Sigma Chapter (commissioned by chapter member Frederick William Vanderbilt and completed 1913).Patrick Pinnell, The Campus Guide: Yale University (Princeton Architectural Press, 1999). * Osborn Memorial Laboratories, 165 Prospect Street (completed 1914).Robert A.M.
