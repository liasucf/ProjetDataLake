    "text": "Kat, known in Japan as Kitten,http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/new-gravity- rush-2-ad-isnt-kitten-about-the-power-of-gravity/ - published January 12, 2017 is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Gravity Rush series. A teenage girl with retrograde amnesia, she awakens in the city of Hekseville after falling from the sky, and sets out to discover the origins of her power to shift gravity. She becomes a hero to the people of the city after defending them from the threat of mysterious creatures called the Nevi. Her powers stem entirely from Dusty, a supernatural, cat-like organism that is bound to her, and whom she later realizes is a type of being known as a Guardian. Kat has received critical praise for the unique nature of her powers, leading to inventive gameplay scenarios, as well as her optimistic personality, which has been noted to set her apart from typical superheroes. == Characteristics == Kat is a teenage girl with tan skin, red eyes, and blonde hair. She wears a black romper held on her body by elastic, decorative pieces of gold metal. She also wears a cape-like scarf on her back, a matching headband, and two bracers, as well as tall socks with gold high heels. Kat initially awakens after falling out of the sky and landing in a small playground in Hekseville, a city that is suspended in midair and attached to a massive vertical stone pillar called the World Pillar. Realizing she has amnesia, she sets out to look for the origins of her gravity shifting powers and begins helping people in Hekseville. Eventually she discovers the threat of the Nevi, mysterious interdimensional creatures that begin attacking the citizens of Hekseville, and becomes the city's defender, the \"Gravity Queen\". She comes into conflict with Raven, a fellow gravity shifter of unknown origin. In Gravity Rush 2, Kat is taken through a portal into another universe, that of Jirga Para Lhao. She finally escapes and goes back to Hekseville, where she saves the city yet again. Climbing the World Pillar, she discovers that she is actually Queen Alua, the ruler of a lost civilization called Eto, but an advisor named Xicero attempted to murder her for wanting to save the city below from an oncoming black hole that marks the world's destruction and rebirth. She eventually escapes and returns to Hekseville, where she saves the city a final time from a dark force that has merged with the current ruler of Eto, an evil gravity- shifting child named Cai. She seals away the black hole, presumably perishing in the process, but she is hinted at being alive in the ending. == Reception == Ludwig Kietzmann of GamesRadar+ stated that he liked the character of Kat, calling her an \"exuberant girl in a scarf\" that stood in contrast to most superheroes, who were a \"tortured dude in a cape\". He also praised how she was a \"delightful klutz\", which tied into the game's initially imprecise controls. Stating \"there's an art to being utterly graceless in Gravity Rush\", he stated that he imagined her apologizing to the people caught up in her gravity powers as she passed by and said that \"Kat's optimism in the face of her innate clumsiness is what makes her special\". Steven Strom of Paste Magazine stated that while Kat's amnesia was clich\u00e9d, it freed her from the typical superhero origin story and established that she helped people due to her natural empathy rather than a past tragedy that befell her. He called what Kat does with her powers \"endearing\", since she uses them for \"smaller, kinder acts of heroism\", \"literally gain[ing] a wider perspective on the world\". Twinfinite called Kat the runner up for best video game character of 2017, saying \"I'm pretty sure it's physically impossible to dislike Kat\", and calling her \"one of the most charming and believably optimistic characters you'll ever come across in video games. Zhiquing Wan of the same website called Gravity Rush 2 \"one of the most compelling stories of a protagonist just looking for something - anything at all - that vaguely resembles a home\". Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku called Kat not \"exactly the ideal heroine\", citing her penchant for collateral damage and calling her an \"accidental mass-murderer\". Patrick Klepek and Austin Walker of VICE stated that, in Gravity Rush 2, while Kat is initially a \"cheery optimist\" who assumes the best in people and is easy to fool, she gradually has her eyes opened to the inequality of Jirga Para Lhao and must become less naive to take on the oppressive Council that controls it. Klepek called one of his favorite moments in the game the choice to let Kat decide whether to deliver a barrel of fuel to the wealthy upper residents, or instead violate her orders and assist the poor lower denizens. == References == Category:Female characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2012 Category:Queen characters in video games Category:Video game superheroes Category:Video game characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with gravity abilities Category:Fictional characters with amnesia Category:PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale fighters Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment protagonists Category:Teenage characters in video games Category:Fictional female martial artists ",
