    "text": "Ima (; stylized as \u4eca ima; Japanese for \"now\") is the debut studio album by American electronic musician BT, released on October 9, 1995 through Perfecto Records. The album is considered a major stepping stone in trance music, popularizing a more progressive approach. The album includes the 1995 single \"Embracing the Future\", which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart, as well as \"Loving You More\" featuring Vincent Covello. Following its release, Ima appeared on the UK Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at 45. In 1996, the album was released in the United States in a double disc format, with the US Dance number one single \"Blue Skies\" featuring Tori Amos. ==Background== Brian Transeau (BT) released his debut single, \"Embracing the Future\" in 1993 through MusicNow Records in the United States, where it failed to chart. However, Welsh DJ Sasha performed the song in the United Kingdom where it saw success, and he paid for Transeau to relocate to the country. Transeau brought an IBM Personal System/2 computer from the US, which the album was recorded on. ==Composition== Welsh DJ Sasha (pictured) provides a DJ mix on the album In an interview with Musik Magazine, Transeau spoke about the composition of the album. He cited that \"Nocturnal Transmission\" and \"Quark\" were inspired by nature, after he was taken hiking by British DJ Guy Oldhams in Cumbria, North England. On the topic of the album's composition, Transeau stated: The album's fourth track, \"Sasha's Voyage of Ima\", is a DJ mix by Sasha, comprising the three former tracks in addition to mixes of \"Embracing the Future\", \"Loving You More\" and \"Deeper Sunshine\". Explaining the inclusion of the mix on the album, Transeau stated that \"I wanted some tracks to stand out for themselves, but I also wanted Sasha to show how he interprets songs. He makes every individual record more than just the sum of its parts\". \"Loving You More\" was composed as a challenge for Transeau to create a vocal track; of which the vocals were provided by Vincent Covello. The final track, \"Divinity\", was composed after Transeau recorded himself overtone singing. ==Release== Ima was released on October 9, 1995 through Perfecto Records in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was released in 1996 in a double disc format, featuring the single \"Blue Skies\", featuring Tori Amos, as well as its remix, \"Blue Skies (The Delphinium Days Mix)\". \"Blue Skies\" was previously featured in edited form on the soundtrack for the TV show Party of Five. This version also includes several singles released prior to the album, as well as the B-sides to \"Embracing the Sunshine\" and \"Nocturnal Transmission\". A portion of \"Nocturnal Transmission\" is featured in the film The Fast and the Furious, for which BT also composed the score.
