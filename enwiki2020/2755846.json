    "text": "Wood Green was a local government district in south east Middlesex from 1888 to 1965. ==History== Until 1888, Wood Green was part of Tottenham, and was included in the district of the Tottenham Local Board in 1850. Pressure from residents of the area led to the passing of the Tottenham Local Board (Division of District) Act 1888, constituting a separate local board for the area.51 & 52 Vict. c. 187 In 1894, under the local Government Act of that year, Wood Green became an urban district. In 1933 it was incorporated as a municipal borough. It was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. A coat of arms was granted to the borough on incorporation. The shield featured yew trees and was supported by medieval archers, recalling that Wood Green had once been an area where archery was practised. A silver and blue stripe across the centre of the shield depicted the New River. The Latin motto was nostrum viret robur, which could be translated as our strength is a tree or more appropriately as Wood Green Flourishes.Letters Patent dated August 1, 1933 In 1893, Earlham Grove House (later known as Woodside House) was purchased by the Local Board to serve as a Town Hall. It accommodated the area's first public library, and in 1913 a single-storey extension was added to provide a council chamber for meetings of the Urban District Council. The building continued in use as Wood Green Town Hall until 1958. In 1965, the municipal borough was abolished and its area was transferred to Greater London under the London Government Act 1963. Wood Green's area was combined with the Municipal Borough of Tottenham and the Municipal Borough of Hornsey to form the present-day London Borough of Haringey. ==References== ==External links== *A Vision of Britain - Wood Green UD/MB *Tottenham Local Government, Victoria County History of Middlesex (British History Online) Category:Districts abolished by the London Government Act 1963 Category:Districts of England created by the Local Government Act 1894 Category:History of local government in London (1889\u20131965) Category:History of the London Borough of Haringey Category:Municipal boroughs of England Category:History of local government in Middlesex Category:Wood Green ",
