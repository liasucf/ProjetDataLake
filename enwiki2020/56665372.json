Kapadia was a wicket-keeper and useful lower middle-order batsman. As India's reserve wicketkeeper to Janardan Navle on their first Test touring team in 1932, his opportunities were limited. He played most of his first-class cricket for the Parsees in the Bombay Quadrangular from 1920-21 to 1935-36, and was a member of their championship-winning teams in 1922-23 and 1928-29. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1900 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Indian cricketers Category:Parsees cricketers Category:Cricketers from Mumbai ",
