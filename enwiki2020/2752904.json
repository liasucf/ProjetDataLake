Founded in 1946, MCYO has continued a vibrant orchestral program for talented youth. The mission of the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras is to nurture and develop and advance talented young musicians and enrich the community with a quality orchestral experience. The MCYO program creates a seamless connection between the artistic and the educational experience. MCYO now enjoys its first permanent home in the grand Music Center at Strathmore. Over the years, MCYO has added several ensembles to expand its outreach to talented youth. With the help and support of public school music teachers, private school music teachers, and private studio music teachers, the caliber and number of musicians has increased dramatically. Currently there are over 400 young musicians involved in MCYO selected from over 1200 aspiring musicians. Many honors have been bestowed upon MCYO. In 1964 in Philadelphia, the Philharmonic performed at the Music Educators National Conference (MENC) Bicentennial Conference. Its summer music camp at Deep Creek Lake in 1965 formed the basis of the Maryland Center for the Arts with instruction broadened to include dance, drama, and visual arts. The Maryland Center for the Arts is now operated by the State of Maryland at Goucher College in Towson and Salisbury State in Salisbury, Maryland.
