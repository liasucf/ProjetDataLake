Samelson was born on September 23, 1923 in present-day Wroclaw, Poland (then known as Breslau, Germany). Prohibited by the laws of Nazi Germany from attending any German universities, he instead attended a photography school in Munich, where he later worked in a factory with prisoners of war. After World War II ended, he began working for the United States Army. He also enrolled at the University of Munich, where he received a diploma in psychology in 1952. In 1952, he emigrated to the United States, following his older brother Hans. He went on to receive his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Michigan in 1956. He joined the faculty of Kansas State University in 1957, where he remained until retiring as Professor in 1990. Samelson died on March 16, 2015, in Manhattan, Kansas. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1923 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American historians of science Category:American social psychologists Category:Historians of psychology Category:20th-century American historians Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Writers from Wroc\u0142aw Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Kansas State University faculty ",
