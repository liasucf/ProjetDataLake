    "text": "The 1968 United States presidential election in Indiana was held on November 5th, 1968. Indiana voters chose thirteen representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice-President. ==Background== Indiana had been a traditionally Republican state that had turned away from Barry Goldwater in 1964 due to powerful hostility to Goldwater\u2019s leanings from its Yankee and Appalachia-influenced Northern and Southern regions,Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 363-364, 397 despite having been the centre of a Democratic primary challenge from segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace that attracted considerable support in towns that would soon become part of the \u201cRust Belt\u201d.Welsh, Matthew E.; \u2018Civil Rights and the Primary Election of 1964 in Indiana: The Wallace Challenge\u2019; Indiana Magazine of History, vol. 75, no. 1 (March 1979), pp. 1-27 However, Wallace lost by worse than one-to-two against solitary opponent Matthew E. Welsh in IndianaLesher, Stephan (1994). George Wallace: American Populist, p. 295 and unlike in Maryland his Indiana support was mostly among the middle classes.Conway M. Margaret; 'The White Backlash Re-examined: Wallace and the 1964 Primaries'; Social Science Quarterly, vol. 49, no. 3: Black America (December, 1968), pp. 710-719 In the mid-term elections, the Republicans made major gains in Southern Indiana with its Appalachia influence Phillips, The Emerging Republican Majority, p. 366 and in the significantly German central section, but did less well in the north of the state. 1968 saw Indiana \u2013 for the second consecutive election \u2013 as the center of a major primary battle, this time involving Bobby Kennedy (who was to be assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan that June). Like his brother John, Bobby was interested in entering a primary in a highly Protestant and Southern-influenced state to test his strength.Boomhower, Ray E. Robert F. Kennedy and the 1968 Indiana Primary, pp. 6-7 as JFK had done in West Virginia. RFK would win the state, but his performance was regarded as disappointing especially in white urban areas where he was outpolled by Eugene McCarthy.Cohen, Michael A.; American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and Politics of Division, p. 130 ==Vote== Nixon was able, as expected,\u2018Electoral Vote: Nixon 359, HHH 46\u2019; Boston Globe, October 7, 1968, p. 24 to restore Indiana\u2019s Republican dominance, defeating Humphrey by 12.30 percentage points. Wallace, in a state with considerable \u201cSouthern\u201d influence,Phillips, The Emerging Republican Majority, p. 344 had some late October polls place him even with Humphrey at around 20%,Mobley, Willard; \u2018Nixon Has Edge In 26 States\u2019; Boston Globe, October 20, 1968, p. 22 but the former Alabama Governor would lose almost half of this by polling day. Wallace gained his most substantial support in urban ethnic districts where resentment of blacks and recent race riots had become substantial over the previous two years,Shaffer, William R. and Caputo, David A.; \u2018Political Continuity in Indiana Presidential Elections: An Analysis Based on the Key- Munger Paradigm\u2019; Midwest Journal of Political Science, vol. 16, no. 4 (November 1972), pp. 700-711 but did not do so well elsewhere in the state since \u2013 like Goldwater \u2013 he was viewed as too aligned with the Deep South. ==Results== ===Results by county===
