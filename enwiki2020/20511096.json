General Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot, the commander-in- chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, followed up his victory in the B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign by mopping up scattered Chinese garrisons left behind by the Guangxi Army after the rout at B\u1eafc Ninh by mounting a major campaign against Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army and Prince Ho\u00e0ng K\u1ebf Vi\u00eam's Annamese forces, which had retreated to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a after their defeat in the S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Campaign (December 1883). In April 1884 Millot advanced on H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a with both brigades of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. ==French high command, H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a campaign== File:Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot.jpg|General Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot (1829\u201389) Image:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpg|General Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle (1827\u201396) Image:Fran\u00e7ois Oscar de N\u00e9grier.jpg|General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier (1842\u20131913) ==March to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, 4\u201310 April 1884== French artillery crosses the Black River during the march to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, April 1884 The base for the H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a campaign was S\u01a1n T\u00e2y. General Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's 1st Brigade set out from Hanoi on 5 April, after parading through the town in an imposing display of strength. General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade, which was deployed around B\u1eafc Ninh and Phu Liang Giang, set off for Hanoi on 4 April. On 5 April the 2nd Brigade spent the entire day crossing the Red River, and on the next day, it paraded through Hanoi on its way west to S\u01a1n T\u00e2y. Marching overland from Hanoi past the battlefields of 1883, the two brigades reached S\u01a1n T\u00e2y on 6\u20137 April, respectively. On 8 April both brigades left S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, marching toward the Black River, so as to approach H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a from the south and the southeast, respectively. Millot sent Colonel Belin's marine infantry marching regiment on ahead to seize the village of Tai B\u1eafc on the Black River and fortify it as a base for the river crossing and subsequent march on H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a. On 10 April, after a day spent scouting ahead, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's 1st Brigade reached the Black River. On 11 April, the brigade set off southwards at dawn on a wide outflanking march to threaten Liu Yongfu's line of retreat. The brigade crossed the Black River and marched northwest along the mountain path, approaching H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a from the south. Marine artillerymen and Turcos of Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's 1st Brigade at a halt on the Clear River during the march to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, April 1884 Meanwhile, de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade painfully crossed the Black River at Vu Chu on 10 April. Millot's staff had assembled fifteen junks and two tugs for this operation, but de N\u00e9grier had nearly 4,000 men to get across and a large artillery train. Five French soldiers and a dozen coolies, too impatient to wait their turn to cross the river by junk, tried to swim across and were carried away by the strong current and drowned. These were the only French casualties of the H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a operation. At 6 a.m. on 11 April the 2nd Brigade left the Black River and marched due west towards H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a. At 9 a.m. the brigade's advance guard occupied a position on a wooded height overlooking the Red River above the village of Trung H\u00e0, whose plateau, thickly covered in tall umbrella pines, offered an ideal observation post and firing platform for the French artillery. H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a on the southern bank of the Red River, was clearly visible five kilometres to the west. By 10:00, Millot's heavy artillery and the bulk of the 2nd Brigade's infantry were assembled on the Trung H\u00e0 plateau. The Black Flags remained inside H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, and made no attempt to dispute the French advance. Millot had hoped that the gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla could support the attack, but Hache and Yatagan drew too much water to sail beyond the confluence of the Red River and the Clear River. Only Trombe and \u00c9clair reached the junction of the Red and Black Rivers to take part in the upcoming battle. ==Bombardment and capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, 11\u201312 April 1884== The Black Flags had thrown up an impressive series of fortifications around H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, but Millot made no attempt to attack the town's formidable defences. Having pinned the Black Flags frontally with General de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade, he subjected H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a to a ferocious artillery bombardment from Trung H\u00e0 with two 80-millimetre and one 90-millimetre artillery batteries. The bombardment began at 10 a.m. on 11 April and lasted for several hours, setting many buildings inside H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a alight and inflicting heavy casualties on the Black Flag defenders. The French did not suffer a single battle casualty. The soldiers of the 2nd Brigade spent the day in complete idleness, enjoying the warm spring sunshine and watching the smoke rise silently from H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a as the French artillery methodically reduced the town to ruins.Challan de Belval, pp. 144\u201345 While Millot's artillery bombarded H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, General Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's 1st Brigade successfully executed its flank march to the south of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a. On 11 April, seeing Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's Turcos and marine infantry emerging behind their flank at Xu\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3ng, the Black Flags evacuated H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a before they were trapped inside. They set alight the remaining buildings before they left, and on the following morning the French found the town completely abandoned.Huard, pp. 280\u20136; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, p. 84 ==Order of the day== On 13 April 1884, Millot issued the following order of the day to mark the capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a: > Un mois jour pour jour apr\u00e8s la prise de Bac-Ninh, vous entrez dans la > citadelle de Hong-Hoa. C'est une nouvelle et brillante victoire, dont la > R\u00e9publique vous remercie.

Je suis heureux de vous le dire. Si > vous avez agrandi notre possession d'une belle province, vous avez prouv\u00e9 de > nouveau que la France avait de vigoureux soldats anim\u00e9s du plus pur > patriotisme.Sarrat, p. 129 > TRANSLATION: One month to the day after the capture of B\u1eafc Ninh you have > entered the citadel of Hong-Hoa. This is a new and splendid victory for > which the Republic thanks you. If I have been fortunate enough to have > spared your blood, you have repaid me by giving lavishly of your energy on > the many occasions I have had to call upon it. I am happy to say that you > have not only added a fair province to our possessions but have once again > shown that France has vigorous soldiers animated by the purest kind of > patriotism. ==Aftermath== Given its strategic importance, Millot decided to occupy H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a. He appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Jacques Duchesne commandant sup\u00e9rieur of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, and the town was garrisoned with the 1st and 2nd Legion Battalions (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier and chef de bataillon Hutin). The Black Flag Army retreated westwards up the Red River to Thanh Quan, while Prince Ho\u00e0ng K\u1ebf Vi\u00eam's Vietnamese forces fell back southwards from Dong Yan towards the Annam- Tonkin border, making for the sanctuary of the province of Th\u00e0nh H\u00f3a, where the French had not yet installed any garrisons. Millot dispatched Lieutenant- Colonel Letellier with two Turco battalions and supporting cavalry to harry Liu Yongfu's retreat, and sent General Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle with the rest of the 1st Brigade in pursuit of Prince Hoang.Huard, pp. 286\u20138 During the last fortnight of April Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle pursued Prince Hoang's forces through the southeast provinces of Tonkin, through towns and villages that had never before seen a French soldier. After entering \u0110\u1ed3ng Yan and destroying its citadel he faced about and marched down to the Black River, crossed the river at Gran Co, then left the mountains and led his troops down the Day River to Ninh B\u00ecnh, accepting the submission of small prefectures. Millot sent the gunboats Carabine to Ph\u00fa L\u00fd, and the Mousqueton to Ninh B\u00ecnh to further intimidate inhabitants of the southeast provinces as well as to hunt down stragglers from Prince Hoang's army. In early May, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle cornered Prince Hoang in Ph\u00fa Ng\u00f4, several kilometres northwest of Ninh B\u00ecnh, but the French government forbade him to attack the Vietnamese defences, having just received news that China was ready to treat with France over the future of Tonkin.Huard, pp. 288\u201390 Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the capture of Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, had convinced the Empress Dowager Cixi that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tientsin. Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain Fran\u00e7ois- Ernest Fournier, commander of the French cruiser Volta, represented France. The Tientsin Accord, concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam. It was hoped the Tientsin Accord would resolve the confrontation between France and China in Tonkin, but a clash between French and Chinese troops at B\u1eafc L\u00e8 on 23 June 1884 plunged both countries into a fresh crisis. China's refusal to pay an indemnity for the B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush led two months later to the outbreak of the Sino-French War (August 1884 \u2013 April 1885).Thomazi, Conqu\u00eate, pp. 193\u201396 ==References== ==Sources== * Challan de Belval, Au Tonkin 1884\u20131885: notes, souvenirs et impressions (Paris, 1904) * Huard, La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Lung Chang [\u9f8d\u7ae0], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [\u8d8a\u5357\u8207\u4e2d\u6cd5\u6230\u722d, Vietnam and the Sino- French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Sarrat, L., Journal d'un marsouin au Tonkin, 1883\u20131886 (Paris, 1887) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine fran\u00e7aise (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conqu\u00eate de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Category:Tonkin campaign Category:Conflicts in 1884 Category:1884 in Vietnam Category:1884 in France Hung Hoa Hung Hoa Category:Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Province Category:April 1884 events Category:History of Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Province ",
