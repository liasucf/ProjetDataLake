    "text": "Yaoi Press is an independent yaoi comic publisher based in Nevada. Founded in 2004 by publisher Yamila Abraham, the company specializes in Global BL, or yaoi comics originally published outside of Asia. Yaoi Press publishes original OEL manga as well as European yaoi in translation, and features both single volume comics and comic series. As of 2020, Yaoi Press had fifty titles on the market. One of Yaoi Press's early publishing strategies in order to improve the reputation of OEL manga among yaoi fans was to headhunt famous artists of Global BL. In October 2007, Yaoi Press launched a comic book line in order to provide a less expensive option for customers. Yaoi Press held a fan convention from the 20th to 22nd in 2008 called Yaoi Jamboree, in Phoenix, Arizona. Various manga artists who had previously worked for the company were invited as guests and an art book of submissions by attended were distributed at the convention. In late 2017, Yaoi Press launched a Visual novel spin-off of their company which produces \"Yaoi, Bara, and Otome Visual Novels\". Many reviews on Steam (service) are often mixed, which consumers criticize the weak writing and bland characters, but praise the art and concepts. ==Company Troubles== In 2009, Yamila was arrested for allegedly selling a controlled over-the-counter stimulant as an herbal remedy online. She received several charges, which she plead not guilty to. Yamila promised this would not affect her business. ==Graphic Novels== * Punishment * Royal Pain * Kingdom of Selfish Love * Winter Demon * Surge * PINNED! * Exorcisms and Pogo Sticks * Yaoi Hentai * The Aluria Chronicles * Saih\u00f4shi the Guardian * Desire of the Gods * Spirit Marked * Enslaved by the Dragon * Prisoner of the Immortal * Zesty! * IDOL * Wishing for the Moon * Yaoi: An Anthology of Boys Love * Stallion * Treasure * Dark Prince * Cain * The Lily and the Rose * ANIMA * Happy Yaoi Yum Yum * Bastard King (sequel of Dark Prince) ==Comic Books== * Yaoi Candy * Offered to a Demon ==Art Books== * Reflections: The Artwork of KOSEN * Dark Dreams: A Dany&Dany; Yaoi Art Book * Yaoi Gothic: An Explicit Sketchbook ==Visual Novels== * My Magical Demon Lover * To Trust an Incubus * Cannibal Lottery * Morningdew Farms * Gods of Love * Mister Versatile * Alpha Hole Prison ==Artists== * Studio K\u00f4sen * le Perrugine * M.A Sambre * Studio Kosaru * Dany&Dany; * Yamila Abraham * Yishan Li * Laura Carboni ==References== ==External links== * Yaoi Press' Official Website * Yaoi Press' Online Store * Yaoi Press' Anime Convention * Arrant, Chris (6 June 2006) Home-Grown Boys' Love from Yaoi Press Publishers Weekly * Lees, Sharon. \"Yaoi Press: Yaoi Publishers Interviews Part 1\".
