He was a founding member of the first Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the Hellfire Club, where he played an important role in \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\". After Wyngarde's death from the Legacy Virus, his three daughters appeared: two possessing his illusion-creating abilities, Mastermind (Martinique Jason) and Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde), and the X-Man Pixie.

Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Mastermind's mutant ability is to cast exceptionally powerful realistic psionic illusions. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, feel, smell, and/or taste things that do not actually exist but only in their heads. He can also cause people to sense things in ways that they would not naturally; for example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. With artificial aids, Mastermind can cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions. He is even capable of affecting telepaths as powerful as Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, although to manipulate Dark Phoenix he required an amplifying device called a \"mind-tap mechanism\" provided by the White Queen that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity's mind, so that the entity \"saw\" them, and to monitor the entity's thoughts, both over great distances. Emma Frost described his abilities to the Sentry in the New Avengers storyline as something akin to a psionic virus, which he plants in to the mind of the victim and allows to grow and change according to their view and feelings. It would appear that these \"viruses\" can continue to function even without his influence, as the illusions placed in to the mind of the Sentry remained after Mastermind's death. Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory abilities to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported Victorian era style whiskers. ==The Daughters of Mastermind== Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: Martinique Jason and Regan Wyngarde.

Pixie's mother claims Pixie is their sister, revealing Jason is her father.X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #2.

Years later, he joines Forge's Outcasts, a resistance cell traveling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter Domino.

He projects illusions of Mephisto, Psyklop, Annihilus, and Zarathos/Ghost Rider. * Mastermind appears in X-Men: The Animated Series episode, The Dark Phoenix Saga parts 1\u20133, voiced by Nigel Bennett. He appears as a member of the Inner Circle/Hellfire Club. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode \"One Man's Worth\". * Mastermind appears in the animated series X-Men: Evolution voiced by Campbell Lane. He appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto and a member of the Acolytes upon being recruited by Magneto. In one episode, he alters the memories of Magneto's daughter Scarlet Witch so that she believes that her father had brought her up when in reality he sent her to an asylum when he found himself unable to cope with her powers. * Mastermind appears in Marvel Anime: X-Men, voiced by Haruhiko J\u014d in the Japanese version and by Travis Willingham in the English version. Here, he is the leader of the Inner Circle (unlike his comic counterpart). At the beginning of the anime, he and his fellow Inner Circle agents, Rat, Marsh and Neuron manipulate Jean Grey into becoming the Phoenix, which later ends with her sacrificing herself to save the world. Also, Mastermind uses his powers of illusion to project an image of Emma Frost for Cyclops to see, to make it look like Emma (who was a member of the Inner Circle in the past before leaving them) had something to do with Jean's death. A month later, Mastermind travels with the rest of the Inner Circle to Honshu, Japan, where he uses his psionic powers to disguise himself as Japanese researcher named Jun Sanada. As Jun, he works for Dr. Yui Sasaki and her lab assistants, Riko Narasaki and Koichi Kaga at the closed Sasaki Academy. But what they don't know is that Mastermind is only working for Yui to get close to her son Takeo, an Omega-Level mutant, who has the ability to warp reality, and Mastermind intends to use Takeo's power to make mutants rule the world. As the months go by, he \"works\" on Takeo's mind and continues break it down. At the same time, Mastermind forms a secret alliance with the U-Men and their leader Sublime. But since the U-Men hate mutants and \"harvest\" their organs (butcher them to be more precise), he uses his disguise as Jun to keep them from noticing his true self and also learns that Yui has had the U-Men working for her too, in order to create a cure for both Takeo and other mutants. Nine months later, the X-Men are brought back together by Charles Xavier to investigate what's wrong with mutants in Honshu. Mastermind sends Sublime and the other U-Men to destroy the X-Men, but when the U-Men are finally taken of and when Sublime is killed in a self-destruct explosion, Mastermind brings Rat, Marsh and Neuron out of hiding and they engage the X-Men instead. After Yui introduces the X-Men to herself and her staff, Mastermind (as Jun) distances himself from the heroes. Later, when Riko and Koichi transform into hideous monsters caused by Yui's cure (now a virus), they're defeated by the X-Men. After Koichi is defeated, Emma Frost, now a member of the team, notices Mastermind's projection on Jun Sanada and goes after him, at the underground chamber where Takeo is being kept. Mastermind reveals himself to Emma and reveals his plans to her, as well as admitting to framing her for Jean Grey's death. The other X-Men then arrive with Yui, and so do Rat and Marsh. Mastermind and Marsh manage to escape, but Rat is killed by Wolverine and Storm. The X-Men, along with Yui, Riko and Koichi (who have now recovered), then corner Mastermind, where he reveals his plans and what he's been up to as Jun Sanada. Afterwards, Neuron arrives, kills Riko and Koichi, and traps Wolverine and Beast in a cocoon. Mastermind then uses his powers of illusion to make Takeo warp reality in constant pain, while Marsh restrains Cyclops, Storm, Emma, Armor and Yui. After Armor manages to free herself and the other X-Men, Cyclops kills Marsh by using his Optic Blasts to evaporate him. Meanwhile, Wolverine uses his Berserker Rage to kill Neuron. After all this, Mastermind entraps Cyclops in an illusion, which centers around him not killing Jean and allowing mutantkind (and the other X-Men) to die. However, the real Jean's spirit encourages Cyclops to let her go and break free of Mastermind's illusion. The X-Men then prepare to face Mastermind, but he's then killed and crushed to death by an out-of-control Takeo. ===Video games=== * Mastermind appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Travis Willingham.
