    "text": "Cheggers Plays Pop is a British children's game show broadcast on BBC1 from 10 April 1978 to 7 November 1986 hosted by Keith Chegwin, who was commonly known to the British public as \"Cheggers\". The show's format consisted of a series of physical and mental challenges undertaken by two teams of children representing their respective schools, together with studio performances by contemporary pop music acts. There were two teams. Reds and Yellows. Team captains were popular based celebrities of the time. Games involving balls and inflatables were played by the teams and a pop quiz too. Each episode also had a current chart single being performed in it. The beginning game was always quite eyecatching. For a while the first game was called Space Invaders. At the end of the show, Cheggers would always blow his whistle and jump onto the inflatable that the final game had been played on; he led the children who all jumped on it in mayhem style to end the show. ==Transmissions== ===Series=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
