    "text": "James Barnard Blake (June 19, 1827 - December 18, 1870) was an American politician who served as the 15th Mayor of Worcester, Massachusetts from 1866 to 1870. Blake was born in Boston, Massachusetts on June 19, 1827. He was educated in the public schools of Boston and attended Chauncy Hall School. When he was eighteen years old, he entered his uncle's firm, Blake & Darracott, which had charge of the first gas-works in Worcester. Blake served six terms as mayor, defeating Daniel Waldo Lincoln in 1865, and Isaac Davis in 1867. During his administration, the sewer system was put into use, highways were improved, a steamer was added to the fire department, and the police force was increased. In 1870, Blake was injured in a gas-works explosion, and died a few days later, on December 18, 1870 in Worcester. ==References== Category:1827 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Mayors of Worcester, Massachusetts Category:People from Boston ",
