Subsequently, the standard was revised by Study Group 16 in November 2002, which remains in force to date. At the time of first publication of H.234, RSA was covered by a patent in the United States (but not elsewhere), the US patent expired in 2000. == Specification == The standard describes three methods of encryption key management: *Diffie-Hellman * RSA *ISO 8732 == References == Category:ITU-T recommendations Category:ITU-T H Series Recommendations Category:Cryptography standards ",
