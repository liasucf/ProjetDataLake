    "text": "The Summer Tic is the first EP by American rock band Paramore. It was released on June 18, 2006 and was sold only during the 2006 Warped Tour and the tour supporting their previously released album, All We Know Is Falling. The name of the EP comes from a lyric of the song \"Stuck on You\", which is a cover of the Failure song. The EP includes an alternative version of \"Emergency\", a song which appeared on their debut studio album. The version features the original screaming done by former guitarist, Josh Farro, which was removed for All We Know Is Falling. ==Track listing== == Personnel == Paramore * Hayley Williams \u2013 vocals, keyboards * Josh Farro \u2013 guitar, backing vocals * Jeremy Davis \u2013 bass * Zac Farro \u2013 drums Additional * Pete Thornton \u2013 production (track 3); mixing (tracks 1, 3, 4); additional production (track 1) * Mike Green \u2013 production, recording (track 1, 2); mixing (track 1) * Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering * Brett Reighn \u2013 additional engineering, additional programming (track 3) * James Rowand Jr. \u2013 additional engineering, additional programming (track 3) ==References== ==External links== *Fueled by Ramen web store *The Summer Tic EP at MusicBrainz Category:2006 debut EPs Category:Paramore EPs Category:Self-released EPs ",
