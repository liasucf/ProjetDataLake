    "text": "Under United States tax law, the standard deduction is a dollar amount that non-itemizers may subtract from their income before income tax (but not other kinds of tax, such as payroll tax) is applied. Taxpayers may choose either itemized deductions or the standard deduction, but usually choose whichever results in the lesser amount of tax payable.Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 2nd Edition (St. Paul: Thomson/West, 2007), 27, 29. The standard deduction is available to US citizens and aliens who are resident for tax purposes and who are individuals, married persons, and heads of household. The standard deduction is based on filing status and typically increases each year. It is not available to nonresident aliens residing in the United States (with few exceptions, for example, students from India on F1 visa status can use the standard deduction). Additional amounts are available for persons who are blind and/or are at least 65 years of age.I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63(c)(3), 63(f)(1)(A), 63(f)(2) (2007). The standard deduction is distinct from the personal exemption, which was eliminated by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for tax years 2018\u20132025.See I.R.C. \u00a7 151 (2007) ==Basic standard deduction== The applicable basic standard deduction amounts for tax years 2006\u20132020 are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! !! colspan=5| Filing status |- ! width=\"90px\"| Year !! width=\"90px\"| Single !! width=\"90px\"| Married Filing Jointly !! width=\"90px\"|Married Filing Separately !! width=\"90px\"|Head of household !! width=\"90px\"|Qualifying Surviving Spouse |- | 2020https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for- tax-year-2020/ || $12,400 || $24,800 || $12,400 || $18,650 || $24,800 |- | 2019https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/standard-deduction-amounts-2019/ || $12,200 || $24,400 || $12,200 || $18,350 || $24,400 |- | 2018https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/22/the-gop-tax-overhaul-kept-this-1300-tax- break-for-seniors.html || $12,000 || $24,000 || $12,000 || $18,000 || $24,000 |- | 2017 || $6,350 || $12,700 || $6,350 || $9,350 || $12,700 |- | 2016 || $6,300 || $12,600 || $6,300 || $9,300 || $12,600 |- | 2015 || $6,300 || $12,600 || $6,300 || $9,250 || $12,600 |- | 2014 || $6,200 || $12,400 || $6,200 || $9,100 || $12,400 |- | 2013 || $6,100 || $12,200 || $6,100 || $8,950 || $12,200 |- | 2012In 2012, Many Tax Benefits Increase Due to Inflation Adjustments; https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-11-52.pdf Revenue Procedure 2011-52 || $5,950 || $11,900 || $5,950 || $8,700 || $11,900 |- | 2011IRS Publication 505 Chapter 2, Worksheet 2-3. 2011 Estimated Tax Worksheet\u2014Line 2 Standard Deduction Worksheet || $5,800 || $11,600 || $5,800 || $8,500 || $11,600 |- | 2010 || $5,700 || $11,400 || $5,700 || $8,400 || $11,400 |- | 2009 || $5,700 || $11,400 || $5,700 || $8,350 || $11,400 |- | 2008Revenue Procedure 2007-66 || $5,450 || $10,900 || $5,450 || $8,000 || $10,900 |- | 2007Consumer Price Index Adjustments for 2007, Revenue Procedure 2006-53, 2006-48 I.R.B. 996. || $5,350 || $10,700 || $5,350 || $7,850 || $10,700 |- | 2006 || $5,150 || $10,300 || $5,150 || $7,550 || $10,300 |} ==Other standard deduction in certain cases== The standard deduction may be higher than the basic standard deduction if any of the following conditions are met: * The taxpayer is 65 years of age or older.I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63(c)(3), 63(f)(1)(A) (2007). * The taxpayer's spouse is 65 years of age or older.I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63(c)(3), 63(f)(1)(B) (2007). * The taxpayer is blind (generally defined as not having corrected vision of at least 20/200 or as having extreme \"limitation in the fields of vision\").I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63(c)(3), 63(f)(2)(A), 63(f)(4) (2007). * The taxpayer's spouse is blind (see definition above).I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 63(c)(3), 63(f)(2)(B), 63(f)(4) (2007). For each applicable condition, a taxpayer adds $1,100 to his/her standard deductions (for 2010). However, the additional deduction is $1,400 for unmarried individuals.I.R.S. publication 17 page 141 For dependents, the standard deduction is equal to earned income (that is, compensation for services, such as wages, salaries, or tips) plus a certain amount ($300 in 2010). A dependent's standard deduction cannot be more than the basic standard deduction for non-dependents, or less than a certain minimum ($950 in 2010).I.R.S. publication 17 page 142 Consider the following examples: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
