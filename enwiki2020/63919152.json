Both nations are members of the United Nations. ==History== In 1918, Finland obtained its independence from Russia after the Finnish Civil War. In August 1919, Uruguay recognized Finland's independence and in March 1935 both nations established diplomatic relations.Relaciones Bilaterales Finlandia-Uruguay (in Spanish) Unlike Argentina or Brazil, very few Finns immigrated to Uruguay. During World War II, Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union which triggered the Winter War. Uruguay supported Finland diplomatically during the war and as gesture, Uruguay donated 100,000 pesos and 10,563 cans of 350 grams of corned beef to the Finnish people.Una historia olvidada: cuando Uruguay ayud\u00f3 a Finlandia (in Spanish) Since the end of the war, relations between Finland and Uruguay have remained close. In 2007, UPM, a Finnish pulp company, opened a mill in Fray Bentos, Uruguay just across the river from Argentina. During the construction of the mill, Argentina filed a complaint against the company and the Uruguayan government stating possible pollution of the river by the mill. The Uruguay River is shared by the two countries and is protected by a treaty, which requires both parties to inform the other of any project that might affect the river. Besides the issue of pollution, Argentina claimed that the Uruguayan government had not asked for permission to build the mill. This diplomatic incident became known as the Uruguay River pulp mill dispute. The dispute was brought before the International Court of Justice which said that Uruguay had breached its procedural obligations to inform Argentina of its plans but had not violated its environmental obligations under the treaty and therefore the Finnish mill could continue operations.Argentina and Uruguay settle seven-year pulp mill row In 2013, Uruguay opened an embassy in Helsinki.
