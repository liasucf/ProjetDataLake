    "text": "The men's freestyle featherweight competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo took place from 11 to 14 October at the Komazawa Gymnasium. Nations were limited to one competitor. ==Competition format== This freestyle wrestling competition continued to use the \"bad points\" elimination system introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics for Greco-Roman and at the 1932 Summer Olympics for freestyle wrestling, as adjusted at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Each bout awarded 4 points. If the victory was by fall, the winner received 0 and the loser 4. If the victory was by decision, the winner received 1 and the loser 3. If the bout was tied, each wrestler received 2 points. A wrestler who accumulated 6 or more points was eliminated. Rounds continued until there were 3 or fewer uneliminated wrestlers. If only 1 wrestler remained, he received the gold medal. If 2 wrestlers remained, point totals were ignored and they faced each other for gold and silver (if they had already wrestled each other, that result was used). If 3 wrestlers remained, point totals were ignored and a round-robin was held among those 3 to determine medals (with previous head- to-head results, if any, counting for this round-robin).Official Report, p. 468. ==Results== ===Round 1=== ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !

Eight men remained. Watanabe was the only wrestler to continue to have 0 points after his third win by fall. ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !

Watanabe, at 1 point, remained in the lead. Schilling's first loss was enough to eliminate him; Tovar had two losses and was also eliminated. Ebrahim and Douglas were each able to survive their first loss, at 4 and 5 points total respectively. ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !

The bout between Douglas and Ebrahim resulted in both wrestlers being eliminated; Douglas needed to win by fall to remain uneliminated but instead won by decision. Khokhashvili won his fifth straight decision, staying in the competition at 5 points. ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:left;\" !

Watanabe's round 5 victory over Ivanov counted. Ivanov and Khokhasvili wrestled to a draw; this would ultimately be the de facto silver/bronze match as Watanabe then defeated Khokhashvili by decision to take the gold medal. Ivanov and Khokhasvili each had 5 points in the round-robin (the tie against each other as well as a loss by decision to Watanabe), and head-to-head results (the tie) were unable to break the standings tie. The next tie-breaker was body weight; Ivanov took silver as the lighter wrestler. ; Bouts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:left;\" !
