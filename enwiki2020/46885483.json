Recorded at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California on September 25, 2014, it was released on June 15, 2015 by Armoury Records (album) and Eagle Rock Entertainment (DVD).

The album documents one of the first live shows following the release of the collaborative's second studio album, World on Fire. It features songs from throughout Slash's career, including all three of his solo albums and hits originally by Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver. ==Promotion and release== Two weeks before the album's release, a live video \"World on Fire\" was released as a teaser.
