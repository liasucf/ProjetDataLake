Before he began training in martial arts, he briefly attended college where he studied, and worked for a time as a welder. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Lapilus followed the path of his brother Damien, who is also a professional mixed martial artist, and began training in mixed martial arts in 2010. He made his debut as a professional in 2012, competing as a featherweight for primarily for various regional promotions across France. He was able to compile a record along the way of 8\u20131. On the heels of his finish of Cyril Ericher in May 2014, Lapilus signed with the UFC in the fall of 2014. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Lapilus was expected to make his promotional debut on 4 October 2014 as a short notice replacement against Dennis Siver at UFC Fight Night 53, filling in for an injured Robert Whiteford. However, the Swedish Mixed Martial Arts Federation subsequently deemed Lapilus an unsuitable opponent, and in turn, Charles Rosa was tabbed as the last-minute replacement. Lapilus eventually made his debut against Rocky Lee on 11 April 2014 at UFC Fight Night 64. Lapilus won the fight via unanimous decision. Lapilus faced Yuta Sasaki on 20 June 2015 at UFC Fight Night 69. Lapilus won the fight via TKO in the second round.

Lapilus next faced Leandro Issa on September 3, 2016 at UFC Fight Night 93. He won the fight by unanimous decision. ===Post-UFC career=== After the sole boxing bout in 2017, Lapilus racked Bantamweight Championships in both TKO MMA and German MMA Championships. In November 2019, it was revealed that Lapilus has signed with a new, Afro-European MMA promotion ARES Fighting Championship. Lapilus was expected to make his promotional debut in the promotion's inaugural event on December 14, 2019 against Bryan Caraway. However, Caraway withdrew from the bout due to an injury and was replaced by Marcos Breno. He won the fight via unanimous decision. ==Professional boxing career== After a 3\u20131 run in the UFC Lapilus opted to try his hands at boxing, facing Heri Andriyanto on May 27, 2017.
