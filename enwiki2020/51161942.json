    "text": "K Street is a historic street in Sacramento, California, United States. It spans from Old Sacramento, through Downtown Sacramento and Midtown Sacramento, ending in East Sacramento. Other discontinuous segments of K Street in East Sacramento are small residential streets, with the final segment ultimately ending at 54th Street. K Street is known primarily as a shopping, dining and entertainment destination for Downtown, Midtown, and Old Sac. ==History== The path of the street roughly (but not exactly) follows the line from Old Sacramento to Sutter's Fort, which existed as a trail before Sacramento was founded.Sacramento's K Street: Where Our City was Born, William Burg K Street was once a continuous street for automobile traffic in the mid-20th century during its heyday as a major shopping destination. Department and other large stores that once lined K Street included Breuner's, Weinstock's, Hale's, S. H. Kress & Co., Roos/Atkins, Montgomery Ward and Sears. Movie theaters included the Crest, the Senator, the Hippodrome and, nearby, the Alhambra. In 1969, K Street in downtown Sacramento was closed to all automobile traffic permanently, as it was converted into a pedestrian mall that evolved into the modern K Street Mall. In 1987, Sacramento Regional Transit opened their light rail system, with tracks running on K Street between 7th and 12th Streets. On November 12, 2011, K Street between 8th and 12th Streets was opened to automobile traffic for the first time in 42 years. In November 2012, the K Street Mall was rebranded \"The Kay\", and now functions as a shopping area.http://fox40.com/2012/10/10/k-street-becomes-the-kay/ In May 2014, the Sacramento city council approved a public subsidy deal to build a downtown arena. The re-use of the failing Downtown Plaza shopping mall was seen as a possible catalyst to bring revenue and people to Downtown. Today, much of K Street is undergoing re-development, with many businesses still active. Landmarks along K Street include:K Street Mall website * Downtown Commons including a Macy's department store and the Golden 1 Center, home of the NBA's Sacramento Kings.

It shares right- of-way with auto traffic except for the block between 7th and 8th Streets, which is still closed to auto traffic. The 9th & K northbound platform of the St. Rose of Lima Park (along with the now-closed 7th & K platform) and Cathedral Square light rail stations serve the corridor. ==References== Category:Streets in Sacramento County, California Category:History of Sacramento, California ",
