    "text": "Laotians in France consist of people of Lao ancestry who were born in or immigrated to France. The population as of 2017 is estimated to be 200,000. The Laotian community in France forms the most established overseas Laotian population outside of Southeast Asia, with a presence in the country dating to before the end of the Laotian Civil War and mass refugee migration that resulted from it.Carine Hahn, Le Laos, Karthala, 1999, page 77 ==History== The presence of Laotian people in France began during the early 20th century, when Laos was a protectorate of France. With the steady introduction of the French education system by the colonists, a number of Laotian students were able to study in France, including members of the Lao Royal Family. A smaller number of Laotian workers also settled in France during this period. Following Laotian independence in 1953 and the Geneva Accords, a significant number of Lao continued to immigrate to France. This wave of migrants initially consisted of those loyal to the colonial government, followed by students and middle class entrepreneurs who arrived throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Community organizations were established by this group of migrants to better serve Laotian immigrant and expatriate needs, and would form the base of Laotian cultural institutions for later immigrants. However, the largest influx of Laotians immigrated to France following the Vietnam War and communist takeover of their homeland. France was an ideal destination for Laotian refugees who were educated or formed part of the elite and middle class in the home nation, while poorer refugees tended to emigrate to North America and Australia through the assistance of the American, Canadian and Australian governments.Knowledge of Immigrant Nationalities of Santa Clara County (KIN) - Laos ==Culture and demographics== Unlike their counterpart communities in the United States, Canada, and Australia, Laotians in France are more successful and better integrated into the host country due to stronger knowledge of the nation's social aspects, such as culture, language, and history. Although the issue of immigrant groups and their level of assimilation has been an important issue in French politics, the Laotian community is highly integrated into French society, with high average rates of educational and economic achievement, especially among the generations of French-born Lao.La jeunesse lao de France, quelle identit\u00e9? (in French) The majority of Laotians in France live in Paris and the surrounding \u00cele-de-France region, where many Lao-based businesses and community organizations are located in the Quartier Asiatique neighborhood of the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Smaller communities reside in Marseille, Lille, and Strasbourg. While the generation of immigrants to France tries to preserve Laotian culture and uses the Lao language among the community, the generations born in France are increasingly influenced by French culture, with many members of the generations being unable to understand or speak Lao. Cultural organizations are present to serve both immigrant and French-born Lao, including weekend Lao-language schools for the latter group. Laotian Buddhist temples serve as community and cultural centers for the Laotian population in France, and important traditional holidays such as Lao New Year and the Pha That Luang Festival are observed in addition to French holidays.Nouvel an Lao (in French) ==Political views== While the rate of naturalization among Laotian immigrants is high, the community is not actively involved in French politics. Instead, many in the generation of refugees tend to closely monitor politics in Laos. Additionally, the community is largely anti-communist and opposes the one- party rule of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party in the home country since the end of the Laotian Civil War. Earlier Lao immigrants and expatriates to France historically played important roles in shaping the politics of Laos during the early and mid-20th century. ==Notable individuals== * Willy Denzey, singer * Billy Ketkeophomphone, football player * Kayane, fighting games player and journalist ==See also== *History of Laos *French Laos, French protectorate of Laos *French language in Laos ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== *.
