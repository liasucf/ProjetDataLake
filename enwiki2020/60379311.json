    "text": "The Gotcha Group LLC, doing business as Gotcha, is an electric bike and scooter-sharing company based in Charleston, South Carolina. Gotcha began operating bike share systems on college campuses in the United States and later expanded to scooter-sharing and other electric vehicles such as electric trike scooters. ==History== Gotcha first offered dockless bike sharing systems on college campuses and certain housing developments, and later offered taxi- like rides in electric vehicles for select markets. As scooters became popular, Gotcha expanded to scooters in some markets. Citing caution about the long-term durability of light-weight two-wheeled scooters, Gotcha began expanding service to electric trike scooters which it believed were more durable, and would allow two riders at a time. Gotcha continues to be based in Charleston, South Carolina, and also has offices in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and San Francisco. ==Equipment and usage== Gotcha offers bikes, scooters, and rides in electric vehicles to various areas, and has announced electric trike service in certain areas. Because the company operates its bike and scooter share systems in conjunction with other organizations, the rates of service vary, but typically include a per-mile rate and sometimes an initial usage fee. In markets where rides in Gotcha's taxi-like electric vehicle service are available during certain hours of operation, rides are available at a flat- rate. ==Locations== === Colleges and Universities === * Michigan State University * Auburn University * Southern Arkansas University * Florida State University * University of Florida * Augusta University * Savannah College of Art and Design Savannah campus * Savannah College of Art and Design Atlanta campus * Lewis University * Northern Kentucky University * University of Louisville * University of Mississippi * UNC-Chapel Hill * UNC-Charlotte * UNC-Wilmington * Binghamton University * Mercy College * University of Buffalo * University of Georgia * University of Oklahoma * Washington State University * Marshall University === Cities and Localities === * East Lansing, Michigan * Fort Lauderdale, Florida * Sarasota, Florida * Nashville, Tennessee * Toledo, Ohio * Charleston, South Carolina * Rock Hill, South Carolina * New River Valley (Blacksburg and Christianburg), Virginia * Burlington, Vermont * Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma In addition to current areas of operations, Gotcha has announced service for the following localities and educational institutions: Little Rock, Arkansas; St. Augustine, Florida; Morehead State University in Morehead, Kentucky; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Syracuse, New York and; Villanova University. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bicycle sharing companies Category:Scooter sharing companies Category:Kick scooters ",
