He was a son of Joseph Howland (1750\u20131836) and Lydia (n\u00e9e Bill) Howland (1753\u20131838), who married in Norwich, Connecticut in 1772. Among his siblings was Lydia Howland, wife of Levi Coit; Jane Abigail Howland, wife of George Muirson Woolsey (uncle to Theodore Dwight Woolsey), Harriet Howland, the third wife of New York State Assemblyman James Roosevelt; Susan Howland, who married dry goods merchant John Aspinwall (a descendant of settler William Aspinwall); and Samuel Shaw Howland. His paternal grandparents were Abigail (n\u00e9e Burt) Howland and Nathaniel Howland, a descendant of John Howland, one of the Pilgrim Fathers and a signer of the 1620 Mayflower Compact, the governing document of what became Plymouth Colony. His niece Mary Rebecca Aspinwall was married to James Roosevelt's son, Isaac Roosevelt, the grandfather of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His nephew was Union Army officer and New York State Treasurer Joseph Howland. ==Career== Howland and his brother Samuel Shaw Howland found the merchant firm of G.G. & S.S. Howland, which imported high- status goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea from China, and sold them to Americans of means. In 1832, his son William Edgar Howland and nephew William Henry Aspinwall became partners in Howland & Aspinwall. Aspinwall assumed the presidency in 1835 and expanded trade to South America, China, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the East and West Indies. Howland & Aspinwall owned some of the most famous clipper ships ever built. In 1845, while the firm owned the Ann McKim which was regarded as the fastest ship afloat, it built the Rainbow, which was even faster. The Rainbow was the high-tech racehorse of its day, and is considered to be the first of the extreme clippers. Instead of the bluff bow that was customary on ships up until that time, the Rainbow had a sharp bow, prompting on-lookers to joke that maybe she would sail better backwards. The next year, Howland & Aspinwall had the Sea Witch built, which set a speed record from China to New York which still stands.Somerville, Col. Duncan S., The Aspinwall Empire, p. 22, Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., Mystic, CT, 1983. The firm and its profits made the Howlands and Aspinwalls very wealthy, In 1840s, Aspinwall's younger brother John Lloyd Aspinwall succeeded William Henry Aspinwall as president of Howland & Aspinwall. In 1848, Howland, along with William Henry Aspinwall and Henry Chauncey, founded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, to provide service to California. This turned out to be a rather good year in which to start a steamship line to California, since the Gold Rush started the next year. Howland & Aspinwall were also the recipients of a federal government subsidy to operate their trans-oceanic steamship line, against which they were forced to compete with the unsubsidized line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The company's first vessel to make the trip was packed with passengers. Pacific Mail eventually became American President Lines,Niven, John, The American President Lines and its Forebears 1948-1984, p. 15, University of Delaware Press, Newark, NJ, 1987. which is now part of Neptune Orient Lines.Elias, Rahita, Beyond Boundaries: The First 35 Years of the NOL Story, p. 8, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., 2004. ==Personal life== Howland was twice married.
