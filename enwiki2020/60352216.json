    "text": "The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, often referred to simply as the Welsh Office Minister is a junior ministerial post (of Parliamentary Under Secretary of State rank) in the United Kingdom government, supporting the Secretary of State for Wales. ==History== A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 under the Home Secretary and was upgraded to Minister of State level in 1954. On 17 October 1964 The post was further upgraded to Secretary of State for Wales, which was a cabinet level role, being assisted by a junior minister. Between 1964 and the establishment of devolution in 1999 there were regularly two junior ministers within the Welsh Office, often but not always consisting of a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, with each assigned specific roles (health, education etc.). Following devolution and the transfer of powers from Westminster to The National Assembly there was only one Under-Secretary of State working directly with the Secretary of State. A second (and unpaid) Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State role was created in 2012 during the Coalition Government with one minister serving in the Commons and one in the Lords. This situation was maintained following the 2015 general election with two Under-Secretary of States, one being paid by the Welsh Office and one unpaid (or paid by another government department for a joint role). Following the appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Nick Bourne resigned and no replacement Minister was appointed. ==Ministers of Welsh Affairs (1951\u20131964)== For a list of Ministers of Welsh Affairs see: Ministers of Welsh Affairs (1951-1964) ==Minister of State for Wales in the House of Commons (1964-1999)== *1964-1966 Goronwy Roberts *1966-1969 Ifor Davies *1967-1970 Eirene White *1970-1974 David Gibson-Watt *1974-1983 None.
