Brown, MD, the clinical laboratory underwent a variety of name changes. In 1969, the company's name changed to MetPath, Inc. with headquarters in Teaneck, New Jersey. By 1982, MetPath was acquired by what was then known as Corning Glass Works, and subsequently renamed Corning Clinical Laboratories. === 1996\u20132000 === On December 31, 1996, Quest Diagnostics became an independent company as a spin-off from Corning. Kenneth Freeman was appointed as CEO during this transition. Over the next year, Quest acquired a clinical laboratory division of Branford, CT\u2013based Diagnostic Medical Laboratory, Inc. (DML). Two years later in 1999, Quest added SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories to their subsidiaries; which includes a joint venture ownership with CompuNet Clinical Laboratory. === 2001\u20132015 === Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Quest Diagnostics, at the World Economic Forum in 2017 From May 2004 to April 2012, Surya Mohapatra served as the company's President and CEO.

Under Rusckowski, Quest Diagnostics teamed up with central New England's largest health care system, UMass Memorial Health Care, to purchase its clinical outreach laboratory. === 2016\u2013present === In 2016, Quest collaborated with Safeway to bring testing services to twelve stores of its stores in California, Maryland, Virginia, Texas and Colorado.

In May 2018, the company announced it will become an in-network laboratory provider to UnitedHealthcare starting in 2019, providing access to 48 million plan members. In September 2018, Quest moved its headquarters from Madison, where it was located since 2007, to Secaucus, New Jersey.

It was the largest qui tam (whistleblower) settlement paid by a medical lab for manufacturing and distributing a faulty product. In May 2011, Quest paid $241 million to the state of California to settle a False Claims Act case that alleged the company had overcharged Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, and provided illegal kickbacks as incentives for healthcare providers to use Quest labs. In 2018, Quest Diagnostics was among a number of US based labs linked to inaccuracies of over 200 women's cervical smear tests for CervicalCheck, Ireland's national screening programme. On June 3, 2019 Quest announced that American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA), a billing collections service provider, had informed Quest Diagnostics that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA\u2019s system containing personal information AMCA received from various entities, including from Quest. AMCA provides billing collections services to Optum360, which in turn is a Quest contractor. In June of 2019, a debt collector, Retrieval- Masters Credit Bureaus Inc. (doing business as American Medical Collection Agency), went bankrupt after a data breach that exposed credit card data and other details of millions of Quest Diagnostics patients. The breach was noticed after many of the credit cards in the debt collector's database were used for fraudulent online purchases. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:American companies established in 1967 Category:Companies based in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Secaucus, New Jersey Category:1967 establishments in New York (state) Category:Corning Inc.
