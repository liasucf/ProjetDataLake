    "text": "Florbela Espanca (; born , ) was a Portuguese poet. She is known for her passionate and feminist poetry. Fernando Pessoa later said she was his \"twin soul\". ==Early life== Born Flor Bela d'Alma da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o on 8 December 1894 in Vila Vi\u00e7osa, Portugal, Espanca was the daughter of Ant\u00f3nia da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lobo who worked as a housemaid for Espanca's father, Jo\u00e3o Maria Espanca, a photographer and businessman. Her father's wife, Mariana do Carmo Inglesa Espanca, who was unable to have her own children, agreed for Espanca to live in their home, where she was raised from birth by both her father's wife and her biological mother, who was 15 years old when Espanca was born. Since her parents weren't married, when Espanca was baptized on 20 June 1895, she was christened as Flor Bela Lobo, the daughter of Ant\u00f3nia Lobo and an unknown father. Her father, whom Espanca referred to in a poem as \"dear Daddy of my soul\", officially claimed paternity in 1949, 19 years after Espanca's death. Espanca's full brother, Apeles Espanca, was born in 1897 and was also baptized as the child of an unknown father. In 1903, Espanca wrote her earliest known poem, \"A Vida e a Morte\" (Life and Death), when she was 8 years old. In 1908, her mother died at the age of 29 with \"neurosis\" recorded as her official cause of death. A few months after her mother's death, Espanca became one of the first female students to enroll in the Liceu Andr\u00e9 de Gouveia, a traditionally male school in \u00c9vora, Portugal. ==Later life and career== Florbela Espanca. In 1913, Espanca failed a final examination and dropped out of school, and on her 19th birthday, she married Alberto Moutinho, a longtime friend and classmate. Espanca and Moutinho moved to Redondo, Portugal, where they both worked as teachers. Espanca taught French, English, geography, and history and Moutinho taught science. In 1915, due to financial difficulties, they moved in with Espanca's father in \u00c9vora and continued teaching. From 1915 to 1917, she collected all of her poems into a work entitled O livro D'el (His book) that she dedicated to her brother. In 1916, Espanca re-enrolled in secondary school at the Liceu de \u00c9vora. After graduating in 1917, she and Moutinho moved to Lisbon so Espanca could attend the University of Lisbon, where she was one of seven women, out of a total of 313 students, enrolled in the School of Law. Six months later, Espanca had a miscarriage and took a temporary break from university in order to recover in the southern region of Algarve, away from the capital city of Lisbon. She had another miscarriage in 1919 and around the same time, Espanca began to show the first serious symptoms of mental illness. Later that same year, Livro de M\u00e1goas (The Book of Sorrows) was published. In 1921 Espanca and Moutinho divorced, which exposed her to significant social prejudice. She was remarried in 1922 to Ant\u00f3nio Guimar\u00e3es. Espanca had another miscarriage in 1923 and Guimar\u00e3es filed for divorce a few months later. Livro de Soror Saudade (Sister Saudade's Book) was published the same year. In 1925 she was married for a third time to M\u00e1rio Lage, a doctor who had treated her for a long time. In the sonnet, \"Amar\" (Love), which was published in her last book, Charneca em Flor (Heath in Bloom), Espanca expressed a \"consuming desire to satisfy her need to love freely as a woman and her inability to channel that love into a socially acceptable, exclusive, monogamous mode,\" which according to Thomas Braga, was a revolutionary statement for Portuguese love sonnets. Espanca's brother died in an airplane accident (some believe he committed suicide, due to his fianc\u00e9e's death), which deeply affected her. His death inspired the writing of As M\u00e1scaras do Destino (The Masks of Destiny). After being diagnosed with pulmonary edema, Espanca starting keeping a diary and twice attempted suicide shortly before the completion of Charneca em Flor. ==Death and posthumous publications== Espanca died by suicide on 8 December 1930, her 36th birthday, from an overdose of barbiturates. Charneca em Flor was published a month later in January 1931. In 1931, Reliquiare, a title given by the Italian professor Guido Battelli, was published with the poems she wrote on a further version of Charneca em Flor. ==References== == External links == * * * * Category:1894 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Portuguese women poets Category:Portuguese agnostics Category:Portuguese feminists Category:University of Lisbon alumni Category:People from Vila Vi\u00e7osa Category:Suicides in Portugal Category:Female suicides Category:Portuguese women writers Category:20th-century poets Category:20th-century Portuguese women writers Category:Barbiturates-related deaths ",
