    "text": "\u017divana \"\u017danka\" Stoki\u0107 (; 24 January 1887 \u2013 21 July 1947) was a Serbian actress. Though most popular for her work in comedy, she also excelled in dramatic roles. Often referred to as the \"Serbian Sarah Bernhardt\" and \"Great \u017danka\", she is considered by critics and many of her peers as the greatest Serbian actress of all time. ==Early life== Born \u017divana Stoki\u0107 in Veliko Gradi\u0161te in eastern Serbia on 24 January 1887, her baker turned police clerk father Bogosav died when \u017divana was still an infant. Her mother Julka then remarried \u2014 to a widowed priest Aleksandar \"Sanda\" Nikolajevi\u0107 \u2014 and moved to the village of Rabrovo (modern municipality of Ku\u010devo). As a result, Rabrovo had been reported as \u017danka Stoki\u0107's birthplace for decades until recently discovered data showed otherwise. The youngster didn\u2019t get along with her stepfather, deciding at the age of 14 to run away from home to Zaje\u010dar where she married a local tailor. The marital union was not a happy one, and within a year in 1902, teenage \u017danka ran away from her husband, too \u2014 this time by joining a travelling acting troupe. ==Career== ===Early works=== Stoki\u0107's first acting mentor was Ljubomir \"\u010cvrga\" Raji\u010di\u0107, head of the company of travelling actors she ran away from her husband with. Originally, she did errands as a washerwoman for the troupe. In her first role, Tereza in Bra\u010dne no\u0107i in 1902, she became a local sensation. \u010cvrga's troupe soon split, and \u017danka joined several former colleagues on a tour of Vojvodina, Bosnia, and Croatia \u2014 border areas of the neighbouring Austria-Hungary where Serbian is spoken. She then acted in the companies of Mika Baki\u0107, Dimitrije Ne\u0161i\u0107, and Mihailo \"Era\" Ratkovi\u0107. In 1907 in Vara\u017edin she got her first dramatic role, a widow in Nada. That same year she became a member of the Osijek Theatre where she was noticed by the theatrologist Branko Gavella. On a guest tour to Belgrade in 1911, twenty-three-year-old Stoki\u0107 left an impression on Milan Grol, literary critic and chief of the National Theatre in Belgrade, who offered her a job. ===National Theatre=== Originally a temp, she soon became a full member of the company, appearing in over 100 starring and supporting roles during her career. Gavella personally directed her in Beaumarchais\u2019s The Marriage of Figaro (as Suzanne), Edmond Rostand\u2019s Cyrano de Bergerac and Jovan Sterija Popovi\u0107\u2019s Rodoljupci. Other roles include: Dorine (Tartuffe by Moli\u00e8re), Madame Sans-G\u00eane (by Victorien Sardou), Katyusha (Resurrection by Leo Tolstoy), Mrs. Warren (Mrs. Warren's Profession by George Bernard Shaw) and was especially successful as Toinette in Moli\u00e8re's The Imaginary Invalid. In national repertoire she distinguished herself in the roles of Fema (Pokondirena tikva, by Jovan Sterija Popovi\u0107), Sultanija/Pela (Zla \u017eena, also by Sterija), Nera (The Hoax, by Milovan Gli\u0161i\u0107), Emina (Zulum\u0107ar, by Svetozar \u0106orovi\u0107), Ru\u0161ka (by Petar Petrovi\u0107 Pecija) and Jela (U zati\u0161ju, by Uro\u0161 S. Doj\u010dinovi\u0107). \u017danka's broadest popularity, however, rested on her roles in the works of one of the greatest Serbian playwrights, Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107. They include Innkeeper Janja (in Foundling), Sarka (Bereaved Family), Mrs. Spasi\u0107 (SYEW \u2013 Society of Yugoslav Emancipated Women), Juli\u0161ka (Travel Around the World), Mica (Authority), but above everything, \u017divka in The Cabinet Minister\u2019s Wife. Written by Nu\u0161i\u0107 specifically for her, and premiering on May 25, 1929, under the direction of Vitomir Bogi\u0107, it was a pinnacle of her career which acquired her the nicknames of Great \u017danka and the greatest Serbian actress. Until 1941, the play had over 200 performances, with guest performances in theatres in Vienna, Prague, Sofia, Warsaw, Krakow and Vilnius. She made one motion picture, Gre\u0161nica bez greha (Sinner without a sin), in 1927, directed by Kosta Novakovi\u0107 and co-starring Viktor Star\u010di\u0107. ==Personal life== After running away from her first husband in 1902, he found her, and with beatings and physical force, took her back to his home. She ran away again. This time members of the troop stood in her defense, and she remained in the company. Well known actor Aleksandar Aca Gavrilovi\u0107 was especially protective of her and soon became her great love Their romance later ended when Gavrilovi\u0107 left her for an actress Mica Hrvoji\u0107. She married a second time in 1908, but the marriage was also short ending on a painful note. In 1939, she began a relationship with a clerk, Moris Pijade, some 20 years her younger. However, after German occupation of Serbia in 1941, as a Jew, Pijade was deported, apparently to the concentration camps of Sajmi\u0161te and Dachau, and perished, despite her urging to Bo\u017eidar Be\u0107arevi\u0107, one of the heads of the Belgrade police, to spare him. Ultimately unhappy in her private life, she reclused to her house in Belgrade's neighborhood of Top\u010didersko Brdo, as a severe diabetic, living with her pets and a longtime maid and confidant, Magda. ===Personality and public image=== Though successful in dramatic roles, as well as in foreign stage productions where Stoki\u0107 specifically excelled in soubrette roles, her highest artistic achievement occurred in character comedy with her irresistibly suggestive acting that included spontaneity, freshness of expression, vivid imagination, exuberant temperament, and dynamic spirit. She was equally jovial in her private life and could be seen out and about living a bohemian life in Belgrade's kafanas, fraternizing with her, equally bohemian, male peers like \u010ci\u010da Ilija Stanojevi\u0107 and Milan Gavrilovi\u0107. When she organized a celebration of her 25 years of acting in Belgrade's bohemian quarter Skadarlija, fans from far and wide showed up, giving her presents that included cash, sacks full of coins, puppies in flower baskets, and war bonds. It is known that, even though she would not get a new role for over a year, she never complained. Publicity stunts include \u017danka being a godmother to bear cubs at Belgrade Zoo. ==World War II== Stoki\u0107 spent the war years depressed by illness and difficulty of acquiring insulin. She continued to act, appearing in comedy theatres Veseljaci and Centrala za humor, often playing a caricatured Pela the Washerwoman, a simple-hearted, blabby everyday woman. She was also active on Radio Belgrade in shows Veselo srpsko popodne and \u0160areno popodne, which were aired after the news and public announcements of the German city commandant. All those shows were, more-or-less, sponsored by Germans, to keep an appearance of normal life in occupied Belgrade. ==1945 trial == After Germans were expelled and Belgrade was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans and Red Army on October 20, 1944, new Communist authorities immediately started organizing trials for collaborators and \u017danka got arrested. On February 3, 1945, in a humiliating revolutionary trial with a group of prostitutes, and being denied a lawyer, even a public defender, the Court for the crimes and violations against the national honor found her guilty for collaborationism with the occupational forces. Her punishment included 8 years of loss of national honor and community service, specifically, street sweeping. It is believed that due to the intervention of Mitra Mitrovi\u0107, at the time wife of Milovan \u0110ilas and a severe diabetic seizure during the trial, she escaped a worse fate as, according to the official statistics, 77 of her colleague actors were shot by the new government, including popular actors like Aleksandar Cvetkovi\u0107 and Jovan Tanovi\u0107. In 1947 \u017danka appealed the ruling admitting that she performed in theatre on her own free will because she needed money for the insulin, but that she was forced to appear on the radio by the Germans. She offered witnesses and testimonies that, during the war, she sheltered Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107, a high ranking Communist operative, future foreign minister and Josip Broz Tito\u2019s deputy, but also Jews Samuil Pijade and the Flore family. She pleaded that the state allow her to perform again so that she wouldn\u2019t have to live on charity. Serbian justice minister Du\u0161an Brati\u0107 suggested reducing her penalty saying, \u2019the defendant has been harmless to society for years\u2019. ==Death== In the summer of 1947, before any official decision on her sentence, she was visited by Milivoje \u017divanovi\u0107, one of the greatest Serbian actors, who told her that \u2018everything is forgiven\u2019. Director Bojan Stupica, who was in charge of creating the Yugoslav drama theatre and making it the forerunner of modern theatre in Yugoslavia, was adamant to get \u017danka for his company. After acquiring a permissions from the Agitprop of the Central Committee and from Radovan Zogovi\u0107, chief propagandist of the Communist Party, Stupica personally visited her to tell her that she can start acting again. Tragically, three days after his visit and one night before \u017danka was to appear on her first rehearsal, she died. On the day when she was to be interred at the Top\u010dider, thousands of people escorted her coffin, kneeling along the road where a bullock cart, with her casket on, passed to the cemetery. ==Rehabilitation== NGO League for the protection of private property and human rights began process of rehabilitation in October 2006, soon joined in the effort by the National Theatre in Belgrade. On March 3, 2009, Belgrade's District Court officially rehabilitated her. In its ruling, the court determined that she was not politically active during the war and that her conviction was based on political and ideological reasons and not on the judicial ones. The court also established that, during the trial, she was deprived of some basic rights, like a lawyer or a defender. ==\u017danka Stoki\u0107 award== In 2001, on the celebration of her 60-years of acting, Mira Stupica, widow of Bojan Stupica and herself one of the greatest Serbian actresses, on stage publicly called for establishing the Velika \u017danka award (Great \u017danka), in honor of \u017danka Stoki\u0107, pointing out that there are no appropriate awards for actresses in their prime, when they are too old for the debutant awards and still too young for the life-time awards. In 2002 it was announced that the new award will be established next year, under the name of \u017danka Stoki\u0107 award. The prize has been awarded yearly ever since, and Mira Stupica was the president for life of the jury (she died in 2016). ==In popular culture== In 1991 Radio Television Belgrade made a TV movie Smrt gospo\u0111e ministarke (Death of the cabinet minister\u2019s wife). Directed by Sava Mrmak and written by Du\u0161an Savkovi\u0107, it follows \u017danka's life from the trial until her death. Fueled by the stellar performance of Svetlana Bojkovi\u0107 as \u017danka, drama gained a broad popularity, and was voted the best TV drama in the poll conducted on television's 50th anniversary. She also was an inspiration for a biography \"\u017danka Stoki\u0107\" by Petar Volk (1986) and for drama \"\u017danka\" by Miodrag Ili\u0107 (2006) In Rabrovo, which is, as historian Simo C. \u0106irkovi\u0107 noted, incorrectly regarded as her birthplace but nevertheless remains integral part of her biography, an annual theatrical festival \u017danki u \u010dast (In \u2018\u017danka\u2019s honor) is held, and on the 50th anniversary of her death, a monument to her was erected in the village. In the early 1990s, a street in Belgrade's neighborhood of Senjak was named after her. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1887 births Category:1947 deaths Category:20th-century Serbian actresses Category:Serbian stage actresses ",
