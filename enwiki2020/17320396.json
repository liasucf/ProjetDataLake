    "text": "Chameleon is a direct to video film from 1995, starring Anthony LaPaglia. The film was directed by Michael Pavone. Pavone wrote and produced the film, with Dave Alan Johnson. ==Plot== When agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration are ambushed during a raid, Agent Matt Gianni suspects a leak, and asks his boss Stuart Langston, to enlist an outside agent. Langston brings in Willie Serling, who is a master of disguises, and whose family was killed by Alberto Cortese, a drug smuggler. Langston sends Serling to jail undercover, to investigate a drug operation, possibly run by Cortese. While in jail, Serling disguises himself, as a computer expert, and recovers critical bank records. Gianni frees him from jail and sends him to a bank, to pose an auditor, and follow up on the records. Serling investigates bank executive, Jill Hallmann, but begins dating her. He finds out that another executive, Morris Steinfeld, is the one involved in criminal activity. Steinfeld finds out that he is being investigated, and reports to bank president, Jason Ainsley, who informs Cortese of the investigation. Cortese kills Ainsley, and also gets Steinfeld killed. Serling, who is targeted next, disguises himself as a hobo, and is able to shoot Cortese first, though he does not kill him. Serling\u2019s behaviour, after the events, becomes bizarre, and he ignores Gianni\u2019s imploring to quit. Gianni arrests at the prison, and the bank, and the perpetrators involved with the drug operation. Meanwhile, Serling transfers Cortese\u2019s money from an offshore account. He tells Hallmann his real identity, and leaves her. When Cortese attempts to come after Hallmann, Serling shows up, and kills Cortese. ==Cast== *Anthony LaPaglia as Willie Serling *Kevin Pollak as Matt Gianni *Wayne Knight as Stuart Langston *Melora Hardin as Jill Hallmann *Andy Romano as Giovanni Pazzatto *Derek McGrath as Morris Steinfeld ==Reception== The Roanoke Times reviewed the film, \u201cThe... plot is standard movie thriller stuff \u2014 a little slow and, at the end, cliched \u2014 but LaPaglia's performance overcomes the flaws.\u201d TV Guide reported, \u201cChameleon has commendable ambitions to rise above the usual straight to video level, but is seriously undermined by sluggish pacing and gross overlength... (the film) is a surprisingly low key, talky thriller that remains consistently watchable, but doesn\u2019t really explore its intriguing premise involving disguise, identity, and personality transference.\u201d DVD & Video Guide 2005 said, \u201cLaPaglia has a field day in the central role, but the film\u2019s plot is just a bit too derivative.\u201d Psychotherapists on Film noted how the film utilizes a psychiatrist as a character; Willie Serling\u2019s boss asks a psychiatrist about Serling\u2019s response to his family being killed. The authors write, \u201cShe says Serling has an \u201cas if\u201d personality brought on by his trauma, and if he is left in the field he could lose whatever personality he still has. She is right, but a new love saves him.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 direct-to-video films Category:1995 films Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:American films ",
