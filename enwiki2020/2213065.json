    "text": "Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend formed in 1998. The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change of style from that of Jeff Killed John led the band to change their name. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Bullet for My Valentine's debut album The Poison was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with Valentine's Day, in a nod to the band's name. The album entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 128. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band made appearances at the Download Festival and Kerrang! XXV, and undertook a U.S. tour with Rob Zombie. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, Scream Aim Fire, was released on 29 January 2008 and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. The band's third album, Fever, was released on 26 April 2010 and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. On 8 February 2013, the band released their fourth studio album, Temper Temper, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200. On 14 August 2015, the band released their fifth studio album, Venom, which peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200. On 29 June 2018, the band released their sixth studio album, Gravity. The band has sold over one million albums in the United States and over 3,000,000 albums worldwide and are the most-successful act in the Kerrang! Awards category of \"Best British Band\" with three wins. ==History== ===Jeff Killed John and record deal (1998\u20132005)=== Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael \"Padge\" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael \"Moose\" Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, You/Play with Me, which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled Eye Spy. In 2003, their second EP was released titled Don't Walk Away. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with \"harmony guitars and big angelic choruses,\" according to frontman Tuck. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came \"directly out of their heads.\" Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison. Roadrunner Records showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five- album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, \"We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us.\" A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, \"4 Words (To Choke Upon).\" Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating, \"The worst part is that the music itself isn\u2019t all that bad, for the genre.\" He went on to comment that the band should be \"embarrassed\" about the release. Zero Magazine's Josh Joyce complimented the band on \"how technical they can get without confusing the kids.\" ===The Poison (2005\u201307)=== Michael Paget (left) and Matthew Tuck (right) at 2006's Roskilde Festival held in Denmark Bullet for My Valentine's debut album, The Poison, was released on 3 October 2005 in the UK and on Valentine's Day 2006 in the US.

On 30 January 2009, the album was certified gold by the RIAA after 500,000 copies were sold in the US. Four singles were released from The Poison: \"4 Words (To Choke Upon)\", \"Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)\", \"All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)\", and \"Tears Don't Fall\".

Bullet for My Valentine were forced to cancel several shows, including supporting Metallica for three dates on their Sick of the Studio '07 tour on 29 June in Bilbao, 5 July in Vienna, and 8 July at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London.

It sold 53,000 copies in its first week and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. Three songs were released as singles: \"Scream Aim Fire,\" \"Hearts Burst into Fire\" and \"Waking the Demon.\" In support of the new album, the band toured North America and Australia in the spring of 2008 for the Taste of Chaos tour alongside Atreyu, Blessthefall and Avenged Sevenfold.

It'll stand the test of time [more] than both the previous things we've done.\" In a January 2010 interview with Rock Sound, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled Fever, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to The Poison rather than Scream Aim Fire and contain no ballads.

People need to give the music a fair listen musically before they decide to judge it. I say we'\u0092re a melodic metal band, really. That\u0092's how I\u0092'd describe us.\" Tuck said he prefers people call Bullet for My Valentine a heavy metal band instead of categorizing the band under specific subgenres.

Tuck said: \"Scream Aim Fire was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. Fever is an album that was a hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do, or how we should sound.\" Tuck also said about Scream Aim Fire: \"Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of The Poison material.\" When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band, Tuck said: Bullet for My Valentine's influences include Judas Priest, Def Leppard, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Testament, Stuck Mojo, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Sepultura, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Dire Straits.
