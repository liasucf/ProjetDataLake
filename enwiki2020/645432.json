Classes began the following year in September at Auburn Community College in the former James Street Elementary School with sixty-nine students. One year later, Cayuga County assumed sponsorship for the college and it changed its name to Cayuga County Community College. Dr. Albert T. Skinner, dean from 1953 to 1955 and president from 1955 until 1978 was instrumental in starting and developing the school from its humble beginnings to the campus where it is now located. Four of its buildings were added during his tenure. Six year after opening, the college moved to its current location to accommodate rising enrollment. The original classroom building remains the main building on campus with other buildings added at later dates: the library (1964), the technology building (1970), the bookstore (1971), Spartan Hall (1980), and the nature center (1983). Later expansions included the opening of the Fulton Campus in 1994. In 2003, the college also opened the Regional Economic Center which housed classrooms for Cayuga students, the offices of several agencies providing employment services to area residents, the new home of the college's NASA-sponsored Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology, and the college\u2019s Business and Industry Center, a workforce training complex. Daniel Paul Larson, D.M.A, joined Cayuga as its seventh president in 2007. Six years into his term, in 2013, the college experienced public turmoil when three of the four unions at the college voted no confidence in his leadership. In October of that year, he tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the board effective November 4. Shortly thereafter, the college also declared financial exigency. Dr. Gregory T. DeCinque joined Cayuga Community College as Interim President in December of 2013. Dr. Brian M. Durant joined Cayuga Community College as President in August of 2015. ==Campus== ===Auburn=== File:CayugaCountyCommunityCollegeMainEntrance.JPG|Main entrance File:KarpinskiRotunda.JPG|The Karpinski Rotunda and the James T.

The \"campus\" briefly consisted of two rented classrooms in the basement of the Fulton Education Center, until later in the year when classes and offices moved into the former Holy Family School building on West Third Street. In the summer of 2001 the facility on Route 3 opened as Cayuga's Fulton Extension Center. It was expanded in 2004 with additional classroom and office space to meet a dramatic rise in enrollment. In 2006, New York State granted the facility branch campus status, and the \"Fulton campus\" designation became official. On July 20, 2011 it was reported in the Syracuse Post Standard that Architectural plans are moving forward for a new Fulton campus. The college\u2019s Board of Trustees looked over floor plans of the new Fulton campus to be built in the River Glen shopping center. Architect Karin Kilgore-Green said of space in the former P&C; store in Fulton will be converted. A second floor with of space will be built over P&C; site. The college bought the former P&C; Foods building at River Glen Plaza for $950,000 and also is paying $495,000 for of adjoining land. College officials said the purchases were made because CCC needed more space and wanted to own its site. The current facility on Route 481 opened in the summer of 2012 as Cayuga's Fulton campus. At the heart of the campus is the Learning Commons, housing an open computing lab with dozens of computer workstations, a Center for Academic Success, and the Disabilities Services offices.
