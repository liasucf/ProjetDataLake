    "text": "Presidential primaries for the Czech Social Democratic Party were held between 22 October and 25 November 2002 in order to choose the party's candidate for the 2003 presidential election. Milo\u0161 Zeman received the highest number of votes. Other candidates were Jaroslav Bure\u0161, Otakar Motejl and Otakar Pot\u016f\u010dek. Jakub S. Trojan was originally a 5th candidate. ==Candidates== *Milo\u0161 Zeman, former Prime minister of the Czech Republic and leader of \u010cSSD *Otakar Motejl, Ombudsman and former Minister of Justice *Jaroslav Bure\u0161, Minister of Justice *Martin Pot\u016f\u010dek, university professor, public policy analyst and journalist. ==Background== Leader of \u010cSSD Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla said after 2002 legislative election that party will have its own candidate. It led to speculations that such candidate could be Milo\u0161 Zeman who retired from politics at the time. Some prominent members of the party expressed their support for Zeman. Zeman's candidature wasn't supported universally. Some politicians such as Lubom\u00edr Zaor\u00e1lek didn't like the possibility and wanted Otakar Motejl as party's candidate. Zeman's supporters included Zden\u011bk \u0160kromach. \u0160pidla's co-worker Sou\u010dkov\u00e1 mentioned that there is 3rd secret candidate. Debate about possible candidates led to speculations that party could hold a primary election to decide. On 9 September 2002, Minister of Justice Jaroslav Bure\u0161 announced his candidature. He was offered the candidature by Stanislav Gross. Bure\u0161 was the first candidate to officially run. \u010cSSD announced decision to hold a primary on 26 September. Zeman announced his candidature on 30 September 2002. On 1 October 2002 the candidates were Milo\u0161 Zeman, Jaroslav Bure\u0161, Otakar Motejl and Rudolf Zahradn\u00edk. Martin Pot\u016f\u010dek joined the primaries on 20 October. Zeman Bure\u0161 and Motejl were considered the main candidates. Zahradn\u00edk later withdrawn from primaries. Primaries started on 22 October 2002. Otakar Motejl was considered the front-runner. He was leading according to the poll by STEM. Voting ended on 25 November. It was reported at the time that Zeman was leading the poll. ==Opinion polls== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=text- align:center ! Date !! Agency !! Otakar Motejl !! Milo\u0161 Zeman !!

However, the results of the vote were not binding and some politicians wanted to nominate Otakar Motejl who came third. Zeman agreed that he will not participate in the first round of voting in the presidential election, with the party selecting Jaroslav Bure\u0161 instead. It was planned that Zeman would become the party's candidate in the second round of voting, taking over from Bure\u0161. However, Bure\u0161 was surprisingly eliminated in the first round. ==Controversy== Primaries were criticised for weak preparations. It was reported on 23 October that voters were able to participate repeatedly and there were falsified votes. Another point of controversy was turnout. \u010cSSD expected that masses of people would participate but the turnout was much lower. ==References== Presidential Primaries 2002 Category:2002 elections in the Czech Republic Category:Primary elections in the Czech Republic Category:2003 Czech presidential election ",
