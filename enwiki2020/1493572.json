    "text": "{| |} The Kamov Ka-15 (NATO reporting name Hen) was a Soviet two-seat utility helicopter with coaxial rotors which first flew on April 14, 1952 at the hands of test pilot D.K.Yefremov. It was the world's first mass-produced coaxial helicopter. State acceptance trials were completed in 1955, and the helicopter entered production the following year at aircraft factory No.99 in Ulan-Ude. It was a precursor to the Ka-18, and was fitted with the M-14 engine (helicopter version). It was primarily used for bush patrol, agricultural purposes and fishery control. ==Variants== * Ka-15 : Two-seat light utility helicopter for the Soviet Navy. * Ka-15M : Two-seat light utility helicopter.
