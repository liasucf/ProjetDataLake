Despite having no university degree, Gubbins was awarded an honorary master's degree from Balliol College and was made Lecturer in Japanese language at Oxford University (1909\u201312). Lack of pupils led to his position being terminated. ==Family== Gubbins frequently visited Colin Alexander McVean's residence at Yamato Yashiki, Tokyo around 1870s, and met his daughter Helen. After McVean returned to Scotland and settled down at the Isle of Mull, Gubbins visited McVean family and met Helen again. 41 years Gubbins and 24 years Helen fell in love and married in 1894, then lived in Japan.
