    "text": "This article gives an overview of the aquatic communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system. ==Introduction== The aquatic communities of the NVC were described in Volume 4 of British Plant Communities, first published in 1995, along with the swamps and tall-herb fens. In total, 24 aquatic communities have been identified. The aquatic communities fall into the following six groups: * four communities of the water surface and sub-surface, in which duckweeds and/or Frogbit are the constant species; these communities (A1, A2, A3 and A4) are found in moderately-rich to eutrophic standing waters * eight free-floating or rooted and submerged, pondweed communities (A5, A6, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15 and A21) * six communities in which rooted water-lilies and pondweeds with floating leaves are the constant species (A7, A8, A9, A10, A19 and A20) * three communities in which water-crowfoots and/or starworts are the constant species (A16, A17 and A18) * two hairgrass and quillwort communities (A22 and A23) * a single community characterised by free-floating vegetation found in impoverished base-poor standing waters (A24). ==List of aquatic communities== The following is a list of the communities that make up this category: * A1 Lemna gibba community Lemnetum gibbae Miyawaki & J. Tx. 1960 * A2 Lemna minor community Lemnetum minoris So\u00f3 1947 * A3 Spirodela polyrhiza - Hydrocharis morsus-ranae community * A4 Hydrocharis morsus-ranae - Stratiotes aloides community * A5 Ceratophyllum demersum community Certaophylletum demersi Hild 1956 * A6 Ceratophyllum submersum community Certaophylletum submersi Den Hartog & Segal 1964 * A7 Nymphaea alba community Nymphaeetum albae Oberdorfer & Mitarb. 1967 * A8 Nuphar lutea community * A9 Potamogeton natans community * A10 Polygonum amphibium community * A11 Potamogeton pectinatus - Myriophyllum spicatum community * A12 Potamogeton pectinatus community * A13 Potamogeton perfoliatus - Myriophyllum alterniflorum community * A14 Myriophyllum alterniflorum community Myriophylletum alterniflori * A15 Elodea canadensis community * A16 Callitriche stagnalis community * A17 Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans community * A18 Ranunculus fluitans community Ranunculetum fluitantis Allorge 1922 * A19 Ranunculus aquatilis community Ranunculetum aquatilis G\u00e9hu 1961 * A20 Ranunculus peltatus community Ranunculetum peltati Sauer 1947 * A21 Ranunculus baudotii community Ranunculetum baudotii Br.-Bl. 1952 * A22 Littorella uniflora - Lobelia dortmanna community * A23 Isoetes lacustris/setacea community * A24 Juncus bulbosus community.
