In 2012, Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) announced that the competition would no longer be played. It was then revived again in 2018 as Vinaphone Cup following the new sponsorship from Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT). == Summary == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2 width=5%|Year |- bgcolor= !width=15%|Winner !width=15%|Second Place !width=15%|Third Place !width=15%|Fourth Place |- bgcolor= |2004 Details | Porto B | | Santa Cruz | Thailand XI |- bgcolor= |2005 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2006 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2007 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2008 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2009 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2010 Details |'''''' | | South Korea University Selection | |- bgcolor= |2011 Details |'''''' | | | |- bgcolor= |2012 Details | South Korea University Selection | | | |- bgcolor= |2018 Details |'''''' | | | |} === 2004 Results === For the first edition of the Agribank Cup Vietnam hosted the Porto Reserve team from Portugal, Santa Cruz F.C. from Brazil and the Thailand XI selection team, consisting of players from the Thailand Premier League.

Barcelona B declined as they could not collect their best squad. Australia was then called to replace Barcelona B, but they decided to send the U-19 team as their U-23 team needed to play for clubs in FFA Cup. VFF disagreed with the Australian decision since they only wanted a U-23 or Olympic team joining the tournament. Finally, VFF contacted the Palestinian Football Association with the Palestinian agreed to send their Olympic squad to compete. {| width=100% cellspacing=1 !width=20%| !!width=12%| !!width=20%| ! !width=33%| |- |3 August 2018 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right| Uzbekistan |align=center|0 \u2013 0 | Oman |16:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |- |3 August 2018 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right| Vietnam |align=center|2 \u2013 1 | Palestine |19:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |- |5 August 2018 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right| Uzbekistan |align=center|1 \u2013 2 | Palestine |16:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |- |5 August 2018 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right| Oman |align=center|0 \u2013 1 | Vietnam |19:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |- |7 August 2018 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right| Palestine |align=center|1 \u2013 1 | Oman |16:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |- |7 August 2018 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right| Vietnam |align=center|1 \u2013 1 | Uzbekistan |19:30 |M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh Stadium |Details |} == Controversy == Ever since the inauguration of the Agribank football tournament in 2004 there has always been controversies surrounding the organisation of the tournament. The most recurring issue is the lack of quality teams partaking in the tournament; for the first edition of the tournament Thailand sent a 'selection team' consisted of local league players unknown to Vietnamese fans, instead of the national team as requested by the VFF. Japan and Bahrain both entered their youth teams in the 2005 and 2006 tournaments respectively, and on each occasion the invited teams lacked the quality that was demanded by the organisers. Due to the expressed disappointments of their Vietnamese organisers in 2006, the Bahrain Football Association (BFA) sent a letter stating their reasons for not sending a full- strength team to the tournament. For the 2007 edition of the Agribank Cup, Thailand once again declined an invitation to take part thus Zimbabwe was invited to fill the gap left by Thailand. Due to the combination of factors, such as the lack of quality teams and the deficiencies of the VFF as the tournament organiser, Agribank announced that it would stop sponsoring the tournament in 2008. ==See also== * Bangabandhu Cup * China Cup * Four Nations Tournament (China) * Indonesian Independence Cup * King's Cup * Kirin Cup * Korea Cup * LG Cup (association football) * Lunar New Year Cup * Merlion Cup * Nehru Cup * Pestabola Merdeka == References == == External links == * Category:International association football competitions hosted by Vietnam Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2004 Category:2000s establishments in Vietnam ",
