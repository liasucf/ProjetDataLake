Although it has a high salinity, it is considered the second largest lake in France. ==Description== The \u00c9tang de Thau seen from S\u00e8te. The coastline between S\u00e8te and Marseillan with the \u00c9tang de Thau on the right. The \u00c9tang de Thau during a sailing regatta. It is about 21 km long and 8 km wide, with an area of . The mean depth of the lagoon is 4.5 m, but in the central navigation channel it can be 10 m deep. Near Bouzigues there is a 100-metre diameter depression of 30 metres. This 'Fosse de la Vise' is the source of a hot spring that feeds the spa in Balaruc. Its size and depth, which distinguish it from other lagoons of the region, is explained by the geomorphology of the region: it is the syncline formed from folding which produced the corresponding anticline of the Gardiole in the north east. Until relatively recently the lagoons from Marseillan to the Rh\u00f4ne were a continuous stretch of inland waterway. Early settlers described this as \"une petite mer int\u00e9rieure et tranquille\" (\"a small sea, inner and quiet\"). It provided access to, in particular, Marseillan\u2014a fishing village that became a trade centre. Linked, now, by the Canal du Rh\u00f4ne \u00e0 S\u00e8te to the river Rh\u00f4ne and by the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux via Toulouse, the lagoon also has access to the Mediterranean at S\u00e8te. There is also a small canal (le canal des Allemands or the pisse-saume) that links the western end to the sea at Marseillan Plage. This canal is only suitable for small craft since both road and railway bridges restrict height. To the east, between Balaruc and S\u00e8te, the borders of the lagoon are largely industrial. The south bank is formed by the coastal strip from S\u00e8te to Cap d'Agde. The northern side has villages dedicated to fishing and the production of shellfish. There are harbours in the towns of Marseillan, M\u00e8ze and Bouzigues, with smaller ports dedicated to shellfish on the northern shore. There is significant variation in the rainfall in the catchment basin for the lagoon, both seasonally and between years. The annual precipitation can range from 200 to 1,000 mm per year. As a result, the water temperature and salinity have extensive ranges. Water temperature ranges from 3 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C, with salinities of 27 psu to 40 psu. The salinity changes during the year with lows from February to June and peaks in July to January. ==Administration== Located between the towns of S\u00e8te and Marseillan in the H\u00e9rault d\u00e9partement, the \u00c9tang de Thau is shared administratively by the communes of (running clockwise): Balaruc-le-Vieux, Balaruc-les-Bains, Frontignan, S\u00e8te, Marseillan, M\u00e8ze, Loupian and Bouzigues. ==Economy and natural resources== As the lagoon is open to the sea, it has fish such as the gilt-head bream (dorade), Argyrosomus regius (a croaker) and sea bass. The lagoon produces approximately 200 kg/ha/year of fish. However, the shellfish industry is more economically important. Eighteen varieties of shellfish are taken from the lagoon - the most important being oysters. 750 producers farm 2,750 oyster tables and take some 13,000 tonnes annually. This provides for about 8.5% of France's consumption. Oysters from the \u00c9tang de Thau are marketed under the name hu\u00eetres de Bouzigues (Bouzigues Oysters) after the village of Bouzigues where oyster production started. They are a flat variety. Fixed with cement to ropes, the young oysters are immersed in the water until they reach a size suitable for consumption. Thau water is graded A and so shellfish can be caught and consumed within minutes. In addition to oysters, some 3,000 tonnes of mussels are produced every year. Apart from fishing and shellfish, the \u00c9tang de Thau provides income through tourism, particularly via sailing schools. ==Wildlife== Flamingos near Bouzigues The Bassin de Thau provides a habitat for a variety of wild animals, notably birds such as herons and pink flamingos and a rich marine fauna, including bivalves (oysters and mussels), jellyfish, fish, and algae. Periodically in the spring and summer, the Thau Lagoon has algae blooms of Alexandrium catenella which sometimes reach such high levels that it results in contamination of the lagoon's bivalves with algae toxins. ==Gallery== File:\u00c9tang de Thau, M\u00e8ze 07.jpg|\u00c9tang de Thau and S\u00e8te from M\u00e8ze File:Lido de Thau, S\u00e8te cf04.jpg|Lido de Thau with the \u00c9tang de Thau on the left, former salt evaporation ponds on the right File:Dawn on S\u00e8te and the \u00c9tang de Thau.jpg|S\u00e8te and the \u00c9tang de Thau during dawn File:Harbour of M\u00e8ze at blue hour 01.jpg|Harbour of M\u00e8ze File:Lido de Thau, S\u00e8te, H\u00e9rault 07.jpg|The Ile de Thau neighbourhood and the \u00c9tang de Thau seen from the \"Lido de Thau\" in S\u00e8te File:Bouzigues Parcs Moules.jpg|Oyster production at Bouzigues File:Canal Midi Onglous.jpg|Canal du Midi joins \u00c9tang de Thau in Marseillan File:Leuchtturm Canal du Midi-Etang de Thau-DSC 0262w.jpg|Phare des Onglous lighthouse at the mouth of Canal du Midi ==Notes== ==External links== *Website of panoramic photos of the Thau lagoon and its region *Photos of the Etang de Thau *Thau fisheries *Info on Thau and oysters Thau Thau, Etang de Thau Category:Lagoons of Europe Category:Bodies of water of France Category:Gulf of Lion ",
