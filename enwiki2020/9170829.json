    "text": "You Turn Me On is the fifth album by lo-fi/indie rock band Beat Happening, released in 1992. It is often considered as their strongest and most mature record and was described by All Music Guide as \"a masterpiece\". In comparison with their earlier work, it showcases more lush and polished sound: for example, the 7th track, \"Godsend\", described by AMG as \"the LP's heart and soul\", runs about 9 minutes in length and features Beat Happening's first use of multitrack recording with multilayered vocals. The album was produced by Stuart Moxham from influential Welsh post-punk/indie pop band Young Marble Giants. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Beat Happening # \"Tiger Trap\" \u2013 6:53 # \"Noise\" \u2013 3:23 # \"Pinebox Derby\" \u2013 3:07 # \"Teenage Caveman\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Sleepy Head\" \u2013 4:07 # \"You Turn Me On\" \u2013 4:10 # \"Godsend\" \u2013 9:28 # \"Hey Day\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Bury the Hammer\" \u2013 6:04 ==References== Category:Beat Happening albums Category:K Records albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Fisk Category:1992 albums ",
