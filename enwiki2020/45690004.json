The goal of the Community is to develop the sailing community in Israel by hosting races and lectures throughout the year. It is best known for the INS Dakar Memorial Regatta, INS Eilat Memorial Regatta and Shiyut Arim, a sailing event that dates back to 1939 and covers most of the Israeli coast. In June 2016 the community was recognized as an official non profit organization by the Israeli justice department. ==Commodore== * Yochai Palzur (2014-2016)EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN YACHT RALLY April 2014 NEWSLETTER * Shlomo \"Momo\" Cohen (2017-) ==References== Category:Yacht clubs in Israel Category:2014 establishments in Israel ",
