She went on to star for Polanski in Repulsion (1965) and for Bu\u00f1uel in Belle de Jour (1967) and Tristana (1970).

Movies as well as a maternal half- sister, Danielle, whom their mother had out of wedlock in 1937 with Aim\u00e9 Clariond, but who was later adopted by Maurice and took his surname. Deneuve was her mother's maiden name, which she chose for her stage name, in order to differentiate herself from her sisters. Deneuve attended Catholic schools.\"The Los Angeles Times Interview from 1992\" Tout Sur Deneuve ==Film career== Deneuve made her film debut with a small role in Andr\u00e9 Hunebelle's Les Coll\u00e9giennes (1957) with her younger sister Sylvie Dorl\u00e9ac who, like their older half-sister Danielle, was an occasional child actress. She subsequently appeared in several films for director Roger Vadim as well as in L'Homme \u00e0 femmes (1960), which caught the eye of Jacques Demy, who cast Deneuve in his 1964 musical Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, the film that brought her to stardom. Deneuve played the cold but erotic persona, for which she would be nicknamed the \"ice maiden\", in Roman Polanski's horror classic Repulsion (1965), reinforcing it in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Belle de Jour (1967), and reaching a peak in Tristana (1970). Her work for Bu\u00f1uel would be her most famous. Deneuve in 1995 Further prominent films from this early time in her career included Jean-Paul Rappeneau's A Matter of Resistance (1966), Demy's musical Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (1967) and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's romantic thriller Mississippi Mermaid (1969). Deneuve remained active in European films during the 1960s and 1970s, though she limited her appearances in American films of the period to The April Fools (1969), a romantic comedy with Jack Lemmon, and Hustle (1975), a crime drama with Burt Reynolds. Her starring roles at the time were featured in such films as A Slightly Pregnant Man (1973) with Marcello Mastroianni and Le Sauvage (1975) with Yves Montand. In the 1980s, Deneuve's films included Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Le Dernier m\u00e9tro (1980), for which she won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress, and Tony Scott's The Hunger (1983) as a bisexual vampire, co-starring with David Bowie and Susan Sarandon, a role which brought her a significant lesbian and cult following, mostly among the gothic subculture. She made her debut film as a producer in 1988, Dr\u00f4le d'endroit pour une rencontre, alongside frequent co-star Gerard Depardieu. In the early 1990s, Deneuve's more significant roles included 1992's Indochine opposite Vincent Perez, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and won a second C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress; and Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's two movies, Ma saison pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e (1993) and Les Voleurs (1996).

In 2002, she shared the Silver Bear Award for Best Ensemble Cast at the Berlin International Film Festival for her performance in 8 Women. In 2005, Deneuve published her diary A l'ombre de moi- meme (\"In My Own Shadow\", published in English as Close Up and Personal: The Private Diaries of Catherine Deneuve); in it she writes about her experiences shooting the films Indochine and Dancer in the Dark. She also provided the voice role of Marjane Satrapi's mother in Satrapi's animated autobiographical film Persepolis (2007), based on the graphic novel of the same name. In 2008, she appeared in her 100th film, Un conte de No\u00ebl.

In 1983, American Home Products retained her to represent their cosmetics line and hired world- renowned photographer Richard Avedon to promote its line of Youth Garde cosmetics, for which she famously proclaimed, \"Look closely. Next year I will be 40.\" She is considered the muse of designer Yves Saint Laurent; he dressed her in the films, Belle de Jour, La Chamade, La sir\u00e8ne du , Un flic, Liza and The Hunger.

The manifesto was an admission by its signers to have practiced illegal abortions and therefore exposed themselves to judicial actions and prison sentences. It was published in Le Nouvel Observateur on 5 April 1971. That same year, feminist lawyer Gis\u00e8le Halimi founded the group, Choisir (\"To Choose\"), to protect the women who had signed the Manifesto of the 343. * Deneuve is involved with Amnesty International's program to abolish the death penalty. * In 2001, Deneuve delivered a petition organized by the French-based group, \"Together Against the death penalty\", to the U.S. Embassy in Paris. * In April 2007, Deneuve signed a petition on the internet protesting against the \"misogynous\" treatment of socialist presidential candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. More than 8,000 French men and women signed the petition, including French actress Jeanne Moreau. * In January 2018, Deneuve, along with 99 other French women writers, performers and academics, signed an open letter that argued the #Me Too movement had gone too far, turning into a \"witch hunt\", and denounced it as a form of puritanism, resulting in a backlash.

While most of her confirmed liaisons have been with much older men, Lozano was 19 years her junior, and in his late teens when he and Deneuve were involved in the early 1980s. In recent decades, Deneuve's lack of a boyfriend of record \u2013 in combination with the fact that she's kissed women in five films \u2013 has prompted speculation about her sexual orientation, which she acknowledged in a 2002 interview with Knack magazine: \"Now that people know nothing about my private life, they start guessing: is there still a man in her life and who is he then? When they see me two or three times with a female friend they say: we've always known that. Well, they can enjoy it to their heart's content.\" Reports from 2000 claimed her beau was a 25-year-old technician she'd met on a recent film, but no writers could identify him. In 2006, Deneuve told The Daily Telegraph that she was in a relationship, but would not disclose the name of her partner. Deneuve is close friends with the artist Nall and owns some of his works.
