The name is a portmanteau word that combines gothic and rockabilly, first used by the Cramps in the late 1970s to describe their somber blend of rockabilly and punk rock. Since then the term has come to describe a fashion style influenced by gothic fashion, as seen in its use of black silks, satins, lace and velvet, corsets, top hats, antique jewellery, PVC, and leather. ==History== The term gothabilly was not popularized until the release of a series of international gothabilly compilation albums released by Skully Records in the mid-1990s.Valarie Thorpe: Interview with Ghoultown's Count Lyle, reallyscary.com. Retrieved on April 14, 2009 Occasionally, the Cramps have been associated with gothic rock, primarily because of their use of fetish clothing and outlandish makeup, including heavy, dark eyeliner on both male and female members of the band, which is also popular in the gothic subculture. The Cramps are considered to be equally influential to the psychobilly genre.Rambali, Paul (June 1978), \"The Cramps: Psychobilly and Other Musical Diseases\", NME. Gothabilly is particularly active in the western portion of the United States, with many of today's bands originating in California.Johnson, Daniel (April 09), \"The Growth of Gothabilly\", RSEE, Riverside County, CA. ==References== Category:Country music genres Category:Goth subculture Category:Rockabilly Category:Horror punk ",
