It is located in the local subdistrict of Klein Flottbek and today belongs partly to the quarters of Othmarschen and Nienstedten. Initially, Teufelsbr\u00fcck was the name of the bridge of the street of Elbchaussee over the Flottbek stream, later it was used for the area itself including nearby ferry pier and marina. The area lies south of the Jenisch park. ==Name== The name goes back to an old legend. At the ford of the Flottbek stream, wagons frequently had accidents caused by broken wheels, so the inhabitants blamed the devil for it. A carpenter was assigned to build a bridge. But he made a pact with the devil and promised him the soul of the first creature crossing the bridge. On the day of inauguration, after a priest had blessed the bridge and the devil was looking forward for a human victim, the county councillor and the priest had a debate who should cross the bridge first. Meanwhile, a rabbit accidentally crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared into the river.Teufelsbr\u00fcck, B\u00fcrgerverein Nienstedten This legend exists in similar form also for other bridges in Germany (see :de:Brickegickel), as well as for the Teufelsbr\u00fccke in Sch\u00f6llenen Gorge, Switzerland. A statue made of stone refers to the legend at Teufelsbr\u00fcck. Earlier statues at this place were made of wood, but were stolen several times. ==References== ==External links== Category:Bridges in Hamburg Category:Altona, Hamburg ",
