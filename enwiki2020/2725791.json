    "text": "The Class 59 Co-Co diesel-electric locomotives were built between 1985 and 1995 by Electro-Motive Diesel for operation in Great Britain. They were the first privately owned diesel locomotives to operate regularly on the British main line, also the first diesel locomotives built for it in the United States, ==Overview== Southampton Docks having been unloaded from the MV Fairlift in January 1986 Foster Yeoman operated the Torr Works quarry near Merehead in Somerset, with much of the output going to rail-served depots at places such as and Acton. From May 1983 the trains had been diagrammed for locomotives but up to 40% of services were arriving late. Foster Yeoman operated an American Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) SW1001 shunter in the quarry so the company was invited to tender for six new locomotives. Brush Traction and British Rail Engineering Limited in England were also invited but could not meet the 95% availability that Foster Yeoman demanded. Inside the cab EMD based the design on their SD-40-2 with 'Super Series' wheel creep control. This allowed a single locomotive to operate the heaviest Foster Yeoman trains which would enable double-heading to be dispensed with and so just four locomotives were ordered in November 1984. EMD would create a new design with their EMD 645 engine inside the British loading gauge, along with British brakes and safety systems and with a cab layout similar the British Rail Class 58 to aid driver familiarity. They were custom built at La Grange, Illinois by a dedicated team of 21 people. The locomotives emerged from the workshops towards the end of 1985 and arrived at Southampton on 21 January 1986.British company buys EMD units Railway Age January 1985 page 22 They were the first privately owned diesel locomotives to operate regularly on the British main line, also the first diesel locomotives built for it in the United States, although EMD powered locomotives have been the mainstay in both the Republic of Ireland since 1961 and Northern Ireland since 1980. Following Foster Yeoman's example, rival Amey Roadstone Corporation (ARC) ordered four Class 59/1 and National Power six Class 59/2s. Foster Yeoman and Amey merged their rail concerns into Mendip Rail, and the rail interests of National Power were taken over by English, Welsh and Scottish Railway.\"EWS to acquire National Power's entire rail division from next April\" Rail issue 312 27 August 1997 page 6 Ultimately EMD's diligence and flexibility in designing and constructing such a small order paid off in opening the way for the later, much larger, order. This design uses the same body shell but is has differences including an EMD 710 engine. ==Versions== ===59/0 for Foster Yeoman=== 59003 Yeoman Highlander at , 1992 As a result of poor reliability and low availability of the various locomotives used by British Rail to haul stone trains from the West Country, Foster Yeoman negotiated with British Rail to improve service. Foster Yeoman had already supplied their own wagons with a reliability level of 96% and proposed they operate their own locomotives. British Rail's problem was the hard tie-in and control of the rail unions, but accepted the proposal in principle. As they already had experience of operating a GM shunter at Merehead, Foster Yeoman ordered five locomotives from General Motors. The locos were built at the La Grange plant in Illinois. Designed for reliability and 95% availability, the Class 59 achieved a 99.8% level during ten years evaluated from the first four locomotives.Heavy Haul Power International :The track record of Heavy Haul Power EMD General Motors locomotives over ten years , as of 7 April 2012 ===59/1 for ARC=== ARC 59104 Village of Great Elm at Reading, 1991 Four locomotives were built by General Motors Diesel Division at their Canadian plant in London, Ontario for Amey Roadstone Corporation (a subsidary of Hanson plc) in 1990 and numbered in the 59/1 series. The main differences to the 59/0s is a revised arrangement of lights on the front to the current British standard. Livery was mustard yellow and grey with ARC logos. This has since been changed to Hanson's blue and grey colours. ===59/2 for National Power=== National Power 59202 Vale of White Horse at Knottingley in 1996 Following Foster Yeoman, National Power decided to investigate the possibility of running its own trains, by ordering a single pilot locomotive. Following the trial, National Power ordered a further five locomotives and a fleet of hopper wagons to carry coal and limestone. Again built at the London, Ontario plant in 1994 and 1995, the six Class 59/2 locomotives differ from the Class 59/1s in several ways. A carbon dioxide fire control system replaces the original Halon system, and the fleet were originally fitted with drop-head knuckle couplers but were later replaced with standard screw couplings. A more advanced slow speed control suitable for merry-go-round power station coal train operation has been fitted, as well as yaw dampers for a higher top speed. They have the same British standard lights as are fitted to the 59/1s. ==Subsequent operators== ===Mendip Rail=== To better manage their fleet availability and scale needs, Hanson ARC and Foster Yeoman founded Mendip Rail. The assets are still owned by both parent companies and the staff are seconded. Subsequently, Mendip Rail has obtained train operating company status. Mendip Rail's Class 59s work services between various destinations, which have changed over time according to demand and specific contracts. They have worked regularly in the Southern Region, most notably to the Foster Yeoman terminals at Eastleigh and Botley, as well as on Channel Tunnel construction work. ===Heavy Haul Power International=== 59003 Yeoman Highlander is now working for GB Railfreight In 1997, one of the Foster Yeoman locomotives, 59003 Yeoman Highlander was exported to Germany, renumbered 259003, and operated by Yeoman/Deutsche Bahn hauling stone trains.\"Mendip Rail confirms Class 59's German transfer\" Rail issue 298 12 February 1997 page 9\"59003 handed over to DB\" The Railway Magazine issue 1153 May 1997 page 59 It was sold in 2001 to Heavy Haul Power International for use in eastern Europe.\"59003 departs Yeoman fleet as new company orders 66s\" The Railway Magazine issue 1206 October 2001 page 12 ===GB Railfreight=== 59003 was purchased by GB Railfreight in August 2014. It was repatriated back to Great Britain from Germany via the Port of Immingham in October 2014 and then moved by rail to Eastleigh Works for recommissioning by Arlington Fleet Services. ===EWS and DB=== 59206 John F Yeoman at Westbury with a train for Whatley quarry The contract for British Rail to provide crews and additional motive power for Mendip Rail trains was transferred to English, Welsh & Scottish Railway (EWS) on 24 February 1996 when that company took over most of BR's freight services at privatisation.\"Wisconsin Central decides: It's the English, Welsh & Scottish Railway\" The Railway Magazine issue 1142 June 1996 page 8 EWS was sold to Deutsche Bahn on 28 June 2007.\"EWS sold to German Railways\" The Railway Magazine issue 1276 August 2007 page 6 It traded as DB Schenker until 2 March 2016 when it was rebranded as DB Cargo.The UK's leading rail freight company announces rebrand DB Cargo UK 2 March 2016 In April 1998, EWS took over National Power's rail operations. From 2005 the 59/2s were allocated to work beside the Mendip Rail fleet of 59/0s and 59/1s. The 59/2s were also maintained by Mendip Rail at Merehead. ===Freightliner=== DB Cargo UK's contract to operate the stone trains from Merehead and Whatley expired in 2019 and was awarded instead to Freightliner UK. The contract included the sale of Mendip Rail's eight class 59s to Freightliner. DB put their class 59/2s up for sale and they were also purchased by Freightliner who continue to operate them on these stone trains. ==Fleet details== Technical details are given in the information box at the top of the page. {| class=wikitable !align=centre|Commissioned by !align=left|Number !align=centre|Works No. !align=centre|Built !align=centre|In service !align=centre|Owner !align=centre|Livery |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Foster Yeoman |59001 |848002-1 |1985 |February 1986 |Freightliner |Aggregates Industries |- |59002 |848002-2 |1985 |February 1986 |Freightliner |Aggregates Industries59002 carried Mendip Rail livery for a short period. |- |59003 |848002-3 |1985 |February 1986 |GB Railfreight59003 was transferred to Germany in 1997 and renumbered 259003.

The train consisted of 115 wagons weighing and long. 59005 was at the front and 59001 positioned as a mid-train helper. It was worked to the junction with the main line at Witham Friary in two parts. 59001 buffer-locked with a wagon which derailed. Later in the journey a coupling broke. The trial was halted but concluded that such a 'mega-train' could be operated subject to some modifications. A commemorative plaque was later fitted to 59005. ===1997 Southall collision=== 59101 was involved in the Southall railway accident on 19 September 1997. The locomotive had just passed across the main line, under clear signals on its way into the goods yard, and escaped damage, but the oncoming InterCity 125 struck the hopper wagons in its train immediately behind. One of the wagons was thrown upwards and became caught on a stanchion before falling onto the derailed high speed train. ===2000 Whatley branch derailment=== A Whatley to Acton stone train on 12 September 2000 was being worked by 59103 when the first ten hopper wagons derailed at 23:20 between Great Elm Tunnel and Bedlam Tunnel on the single track branch line to the Hanson Quarry at Whatley. The locomotive and the first two hoppers rolled and 59103 came to rest on the parapet of a small bridge on the driver's side (left by direction of travel) with the trailing bogie partially torn off by the following hopper wagon. The locomotive was pulled upright on 19 September 2000 and removed to Whatley Quarry where an initial assessment of the damage was made and repairs made to make the locomotive safe for removal by road. The locomotive was then moved by road to Derby on 2 November 2000 for further assessment before moving to Eastleigh for repairs. ===2017 East Somerset Junction derailment=== 59001 was hauling a freight train containing aggregates which derailed due to gauge spread at East Somerset Junction, Witham Friary on 20 March 2017. ==Model railways== In 2006 Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 59 in OO gauge. Since 2017 Hornby have produced a basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in a variety of liveries. ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *History of Class59 at SEMG *Testing the class 59 59 Category:Co-Co locomotives Category:Electro-Motive Division locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1985 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Great Britain Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of Great Britain Category:Diesel- electric locomotives of Germany ",
