    "text": "The statue, currently in the Adana Archaeology Museum Distribution of the Luwian language, shown in purple. The \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription is a Hieroglyphic Luwian-Phoenician bilingual inscription, uncovered in 1997 near \u00c7ine, Y\u00fcre\u011fir, Adana Province, Turkey (ancient Cilicia). The village of \u00c7ine lies 30 km south of Adana. The inscription is dated to the 8th century BC. It was originally published in 1998 in the Turkish M\u00fcze Kurtarma Kaz\u0131lar\u0131 Semineri, and then by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000).Tekoglu, R. & Lemaire, A. (2000). La bilingue royale louvito-ph\u00e9nicienne de \u00c7inek\u00f6y. Comptes rendus de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions, et belleslettres, ann\u00e9e 2000, 960-1006. Important additions to the interpretation of the Luwian version were made in I. Yakubovich, Phoenician and Luwian in Early Iron Age Cilicia, Anatolian Studies 65 (2015), pp. 40-44 and J. D. Hawkins The Ending of the \u00c7inek\u00f6y Inscription, At the Dawn of History: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honour of J.N. Postgate, ed. Y. Heffron et al., Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2017, pp. 211-216 Another important inscription of the same type is known as the Karatepe inscription, which was known earlier. Both of these inscriptions trace the kings of ancient Adana from the \"house of Mopsos\" (given in Hieroglyphic Luwian as Muksa and in Phoenician as Mopsos in the form mps). He was a legendary king of antiquity. ==Background== The object on which the inscription is found is a monument to the Storm God Tarhunza. The inscription was authored by the man known as Urikki in Assyrian texts, which is equivalent to War(a)ika in Luwian. The question whether it is the same person as Awar(i)ku of the Karatepe inscription or a different one remains debatable.Zsolt Simon, Awarikus und Warikas: Zwei K\u00f6nige von Hiyawa, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Assyriologie 104/1 (2014): 91-103; Trevor Bryce, The land of Hiyawa (Que) revisited, Anatolian Studies 66 (2016), p. 70 He was the vassal king of Quw\u00ea (Assyrian name), the modern Cilicia. In Luwian this region was known as 'Hiyawa'.Trevor Bryce, The World of The Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History. Oxford University Press, 2012 In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. ==Significance== The \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription was the subject of a 2006 paper published in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name \"Syria\" being derived from \"Assyria\" (see Etymology of Syria). The Luwian inscription reads \"Sura/i\" whereas the Phoenician translation reads \u2019\u0160R or \"Ashur\" which, according to Rollinger (2006), \"settles the problem once and for all\". ==The text== Part of \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription in Adana Archaeology Museum The examined section of the Luwian inscription reads: ::\u00a7VI And then, the/an Assyrian king (su+ra/i-wa/i-ni-sa(URBS)) and the whole Assyrian \"House\" (su+ra/i-wa/i-za- ha(URBS)) were made a fa[ther and a mo]ther for me, \u00a7VII and Hiyawa and Assyria (su+ra/i-wa/i-ia-sa-ha(URBS)) were made a single \u201cHouse.\u201d The corresponding Phoenician inscription reads: ::And the king [of A\u0161\u0161ur and (?)] ::the whole \u201cHouse\u201d of A\u0161\u0161ur (\u2019\u0160R) were for me a father [and a] ::mother, and the DNNYM and the Assyrians (\u2019\u0160RYM) ::were a single \u201cHouse.\u201d Also, in the Phoenician version of the inscription, Awariku claims to have built 15 fortresses in his kingdom.Trevor Bryce, The World of The Neo-Hittite Kingdoms: A Political and Military History. Oxford University Press, 2012 In the Luwian version of the same inscription, the same sentence is misinterpreted as a reference to destroying fortresses.I.
