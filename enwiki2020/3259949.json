During his playing days, Werth stood tall, weighing ; he batted and threw right-handed. While primarily a right fielder throughout his career, Werth also played left field for the Nationals. ==Background== Werth was born in Springfield, Illinois, the son of Jeff Gowan, a collegiate baseball and football player who broke all the receiving records and led all Division I wide receivers in receptions while at Illinois State University, and played outfield in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system in 1978 and Kim Schofield, who competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in the long jump and 100 meters.

Werth is married with two children. ==Baseball career== ===Early career=== Werth was successful as a youngster, playing for the top youth traveling teams in Springfield, Illinois. His teams began traveling when he was seven and dominated the state of Illinois youth baseball with four consecutive state championships (never finishing worse than fourth in nationals) in Khoury League with the Bunn Brewers. He then played for a national power, the Springfield Flame, where his team won the state and Midwest Regional and finished third in the 1993 Sandy Koufax World Series in Spring, Texas, behind Pico Rivera, California and a Dallas, Texas, team that included future major leaguer Vernon Wells. Werth also was selected to play for the U.S. Junior Pan Am Games in 1995. He gained more attention while attending Glenwood High School in Chatham, Illinois, where he compiled a .616 batting average in his senior year with 15 home runs in 31 games and helped his team to the state championship in 1996 (his junior year). Werth was named to the 1997 All-America First Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings as a catcher. Werth initially planned on playing college baseball at the University of Georgia, but changed his plans when he was drafted in the first round (22nd overall) by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. In the minor leagues, Werth played catcher as his primary position. ===Toronto Blue Jays=== Prior to making his major- league debut, the Orioles traded Werth to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher John Bale. Werth broke into the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2002. It was with Toronto when he began the switch to the outfield from catcher. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== On March 29, 2004, Werth was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jason Frasor after two seasons in Toronto.

Eight months later, Werth underwent exploratory surgery which revealed two ligament tears that were repaired; however, his discomfort never subsided.
