    "text": "A grison , also known as a South American wolverine,ZipcodeZoo - Online Encyclopedia About Plants & Animals is any mustelid in the genus Galictis. Native to Central and South America, the genus contains two extant species: the greater grison (Galictis vittata), which is found widely in South America, through Central America to southern Mexico; and the lesser grison (Galictis cuja), which is restricted to the southern half of South America. == Names == The generic name Galictis joins two Greek words: (, \"weasel\") and (, marten/weasel). \"New Latin, from Greek weasel + yellow-breasted marten\". Lewis and Short defines ictis () simply as \"a kind of weasel\". Brill's New Pauly likewise also notes that \"/ may be a weasel\" Compare the word Galidictis (a mongoose genus). The common name ' is from a French word for \"gray\", a variant of , also meaning \"gray\". \"French, from gray, from Middle French, from \" Locally, in Spanish, it is referred to as a (literally \"little ferret\") or . In Portuguese, it is a . == Description == Grisons measure up to in length, and weigh between . The lesser grison is slightly smaller than the greater grison. Grisons generally resemble a skunk, but with a smaller tail, shorter legs, wider neck, and more robust body. The pelage along the back is a frosted gray with black legs, throat, face, and belly. A sharp white stripe extends from the forehead to the back of the neck. == Habitat == They are found in a wide range of habitats from semi-open shrub and woodland to low-elevation forests. They are generally terrestrial, burrowing and nesting in holes in fallen trees or rock crevices, often living underground. They are omnivorous, consuming fruit and small animals (including mammals). Little is known about grison behavior for multiple reasons, including that their necks are so wide compared to their heads, an unusual difficulty that has made radio tracking problematic. ==Evolution== ===Extant species=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

They may be descended from the fossil genera Trigonictis and Sminthosinus, which lived in North America during the mid to late Pliocene. There are at least three known fossil species, all of which were found in Argentina: * \u2020 Galictis hennigi * \u2020 Galictis sanandresensis * \u2020 Galictis sorgentinii ==References== * Nowak, Ronald M.
