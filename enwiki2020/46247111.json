He is the cousin of San Marino goalkeeper Simone. ==Club career== Benedettini began his career at San Marino Calcio in Lega Pro, the third tier of the Italian football system. He was first called up to a matchday squad on 24 September 2012, remaining an unused substitute in a 0-1 home loss against Pavia at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. On 10 February 2013 he was called up again and remained unused in a 2-0 home win over PortoSummaga. His third call-up on 5 May resulted in his only appearance of the season, in a home match against Cremonese. Starting goalkeeper Mattia Migani was sent off in the second minute, so forward Francesco Cassola was substituted for Benedettini, who immediately conceded a penalty kick by Giuseppe Le Noci in an eventual 1-6 defeat. On 21 July 2013, he joined Cesena for an undisclosed fee. In July 2014, Benedettini moved to Serie D club Pianese. In July 2016, he moved to Serie B club Novara on a free transfer. He made his competitive debut for the club on 24 December 2016 in a 4\u20131 away defeat to Virtus Entella. ==International career== He made his senior international debut for San Marino on 27 June 2015, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Slovenia in Ljubljana, a 0-6 defeat. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1995 births Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Sammarinese footballers Category:Sammarinese expatriate footballers Category:San Marino international footballers Category:San Marino Calcio players Category:A.C.
