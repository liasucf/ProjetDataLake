    "text": "The Advance New Zealand Party is a political party in New Zealand led by Jami- Lee Ross and Billy Te Kahika. The idea was first unveiled in a newsletter from Ross released in April 2020. He claims the party is a centrist and anti- corruption movement designed to appeal to voters \"in the middle\"; however, their main policies represent the political fringe rather than centre. Ross had been a member of the centre-right New Zealand National Party until a public spat with leader Simon Bridges during which he accused Bridges of corruption. Ross has since been accused of sexual harassment and bullying, and is currently under investigation for corruption himself. In July 2020, it entered into a pact with New Zealand Public Party, a conspiracy theory party that spread misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This misinformation has been shared on the Advance NZ Facebook page. The party did not win any seats in the 2020 New Zealand general election. == Background == Jami-Lee Ross had been a long-time stalwart for New Zealand's centre-right National Party, having been elected to the Manukau City Council in 2004 aged just 18, and later as a Member of Parliament for Botany at 25 in 2011. Being one of the safest seats for the National Party, Ross continued to win Botany by comfortable margins. Ross became the party's Senior Whip in May 2017. After the National Party lost power at the 2017 election, Ross became a high-ranking figure in the Opposition led by new National leader Simon Bridges, serving as party spokesperson for Transport and Infrastructure. In a highly publicised falling out, Ross accused Bridges of corruption involving a $100,000 donation to the party, filing a false return and falsifying the name of a donor to hide the identity. Bridges denied all of the claims. Ross departed from the National Party in October 2018, just before the National Party voted to expel him. The party went through with the vote to expel him anyway. Ross then released the audio from conversations between him and Bridges which he said backed up his claim. In a press conference on 16 October, Ross announced his intention to resign his seat and contest the resulting by-election as an Independent candidate. In the end however Ross chose to remain in Parliament and the election never took place. Ross was subsequently accused of sexual harassment and bullying behaviour towards staff members, National Party officials, and members of Parliament. On 29 January 2020 the Serious Fraud Office announced they had charged four people in relation to the claims made by Ross in 2018 around the NZ$100,000 donation. It was said that none of the sitting National Party MPs at the time, including Simon Bridges, were among the four charged. On 19 February 2020, it was reported that Ross was one among four people charged by the SFO over a $105,000 donation made to the National Party in June 2018. The SFO alleged that Ross and the other defendants, three Chinese businessmen, had committed fraud by splitting the 2018 donation into sums of money less than $15,000, which were then transferred into the bank accounts of eight different people before being donated to the National Party. On 25 February, Ross and the other defendants appeared in court where they pleaded not guilty to the charges relating to the National Party donations. == Creation == With Ross's case still ongoing in the Auckland District Court, he announced his intention to create his own political party in an April 2020 newsletter. The party was described by Ross as a \"new political movement\" designed to appeal to \"brave voices in the middle that speak truth to power\". Little else is known about the party beyond its broadly centrist ethos and central issue of anti-corruption \u2013 in particular, opposition to the Chinese government's alleged influence on New Zealand. Ross had previously stated he would contest his seat of Botany as the Advance NZ candidate, going up against National candidate and former Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon. However, just days before the close of nominations he announced he would not contest Botany and would instead run as a list-only candidate. In July 2020, the Advance New Zealand Party applied for registration with the Electoral Commission. It achieved registration on 6 August 2020. By mid-September, Ross claimed the party had 7,000 members. == Alliances with other parties == Advance New Zealand has four component parties: the New Zealand Public Party, the New Zealand People's Party, Direct Democracy New Zealand, and Reset NZ. Jami-Lee Ross has said that his plan for the party based on the structure and make-up of the Alliance Party, and he has proposed an arrangement where smaller parties would maintain their own identity and board, but stand candidates under a shared party list as Advance. Ross also said that he had also invited the New Zealand Outdoors Party, New Conservative Party, The Opportunities Party, Social Credit, Heartland New Zealand Party and ONE Party to join Advance in the alliance. The New Conservatives, TOP, Outdoors Party, and ONE Party rejected the offer. Winston Peters stated that Advance approached his party, New Zealand First, which he rejected, saying that Advance was \"dangerous, particularly to Maori and Polynesian people\". === New Zealand Public Party === On 26 July 2020 Ross announced that he was merging Advance New Zealand with the New Zealand Public Party. Public Party leader Billy Te Kahika became co-leader of Advance. Te Kahika is ranked first on Advance's party's list and he will contest the electorate of Te Tai Tokerau, though on behalf of the NZ Public Party. All other party candidates are running under the Advance NZ banner. The New Zealand Public Party, which subscribes to many conspiracy theories, is known for spreading misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as opposition to 5G technology, 1080 poison and fluoridation. On 16 August 2020 the Electoral Commission announced that it recognised the Public Party as a component party of Advance New Zealand. === New Zealand People's Party === Ross appeared in a Facebook video of 29 July 2020 and stated that the New Zealand People's Party would be joining with Advance. The Electoral Commission confirmed that the People's Party was a component party of Advance on 18 August. The People's Party is a formerly-registered political party which contested the 2017 general election and two by-elections in 2016 with a particular focus on the rights of immigrants. === Direct Democracy New Zealand === On 18 August, the Electoral Commission also announced that Direct Democracy New Zealand was recorded as a component party of Advance New Zealand. According to its website, the party advocates for binding referendums, and opposes large-scale immigration, and \"race-based\" policies. === Reset NZ === On 18 August, the Electoral Commission also announced that Reset NZ was recorded as a component party of Advance New Zealand. According to Reset NZ's website, the party was founded by private investigator and intelligence analyst, Michael Stace, and its main policy is to dissolve Parliament and replace it with an interim governing body of three leaders and a 'brain trust' of 21 people selected by the leaders. This group would develop a new government structure, which would include a constitution and the banning of 'career politicians'. == 2020 election == The Advance Party received a broadcasting allocation of $62,186 for the 2020 election. On 24 August 2020 Advance New Zealand declared $65,633.23 from the Public Party, the second-largest donation declared by any party so far that year. In late August 2020, the party posted a video claiming that the Government had passed legislation forcing New Zealanders to be vaccinated against COVID-19. According to news outlet Agence France-Presse, the advertisement includes footage from parliament video that had been edited mid-sentence to change the meaning of MP Erica Stanford's speech. Any use of parliamentary footage in political advertising is against parliamentary rules, and the Speaker of the House ordered the removal of the footage from social media. Advance refused to comply. After co-leader Ross refused to withdraw the video, he was referred to the Parliamentary Privileges Committee by Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard, who unanimously agreed Ross had broken parliamentary rules, though with Parliament about to be dissolved, the next steps would be for the next Privileges Committee to determine. The party's leaders organised a rally on 12 September 2020, in which a crowd of a few thousand protested against lockdowns and other restrictions due to Covid-19, the 5G cellphone network, vaccines, the government in general, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The crowd ignored social distancing requirements and most did not have masks; police recognised people\u2019s lawful right to protest, but also said they recognise the need for people to follow the current level 2 restrictions to do their part to help prevent the spread of Covid-19\" and said they \"will continue to take an educative approach with attendees and organisers when necessary.\u201d Also in September, Te Kahika was spoken to by police for incorrectly wearing a mask on a flight from Wellington to Dunedin; he wore a mask for the flight but refused to cover his nose with it. On 15 September, Ross announced that he would no longer contest the seat of Botany at the election, a seat that he had held as a National MP from 2011 to 2018, then as an independent MP until 2020. Instead Ross said he would campaign as a list- only candidate for the Advance Party. In late September, co-leaders Ross and Te Kahika filed an urgent interlocutory injunction application at the Auckland High Court against MediaWorks after their party was excluded from the Newshub Nation multi-party leaders' debate scheduled for 3 October 2020. However, the court ruled against them. On 8 October, Advance NZ was ordered by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to remove its election advertisement that claimed COVID-19 deaths were comparable to the seasonal flu, saying it was \"unfounded and socially irresponsible.\" Newspapers owned by NZME said they will comply with the order and not run the ad again, but Jami-Lee Ross said that the party will not comply with the ruling, saying that the ASA should not try to interfere in election debate and free speech. On 16 October, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld most of the complaints against the Advance NZ and New Zealand Public parties. On 14 October, TVNZ alleged that the party was soliciting donations from the US anti-vaccination movement and directing them to the Public Party in order to bypass New Zealand's ban on foreign donations. On 15 October, Advance NZ's Facebook page was taken down during the middle of Te Kahika doing a live feed. Facebook justified its actions on the grounds that the party had repeatedly violated their policies by spreading misinformation about COVID-19 on their platforms. Co-Leader Te Kahika denounced the social media company's actions as \"election interference.\" The party had stated the day before they had been warned they would be unpublished for violating Facebook's community standards. The party won 20,878 party votes in the election, or 0.9% of the total. Following the count, co-leader Billy Te Kahika claimed the results had been \"diddled\" and that the election had been \"rigged\". The Electoral Commission denied the claim. === Polling === Advance began to register in polls in September. It received 0.8% of support in Colmar Brunton's mid-September poll, and 0.6% in its late-September poll. ==Election results== ===House of Representatives=== {| class=wikitable ! rowspan=2| Election ! colspan=2| Candidates nominated ! rowspan=2| Seats won ! rowspan=2| Votes ! rowspan=2| Vote share % ! rowspan=2| Position ! rowspan=2| MPs in parliament |- align=\"center\" !
