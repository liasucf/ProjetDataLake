Ventrum is tricarinate, but furrows are not very deep. Ribs are present even on living chamber and have sigmoidal shape. It differs from Lioceratoides by being more evolute and having thicker whorl section. Ribs are also are more regularly arranged. ==References== Category:Ammonitida genera Category:Hildoceratidae Category:Pliensbachian life Category:Toarcian life Category:Early Jurassic ammonites of Europe Category:Ammonites of Africa Category:Ammonite genera ",
