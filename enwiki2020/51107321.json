    "text": "The Painted cave is an archaeological museum and park in the town of Galdar, located the northwest of Grand Canary in the Canary Islands, Spain. This centre is part of the Spanish Ministry of Culture, Historic Heritage and Museums of the town council of Grand Canary. Inside are found some of the most representative archaeological vestiges of pre-Hispanic Canaries, with characteristics unique within Spain. The Painted cave is considered as the \"Sistine chapel\" of the former inhabitants of the island, the Canarii. == Location == The Painted cave is located at n\u00ba 2 Audiencia street, in the centre of G\u00e1ldar, 27 km west of Las Palmas and 50 km N-W of the international airport of Gran Canaria. Painted cave, localisation on cuevapintada.com. == Discovery and evolution == The cave was discovered in 1862 on the occasion of agricultural works, through a hole in its roof. The \"official discovery\" had to wait until 1873, when Jos\u00e9 Ramos Orihuela visited the cave. In 1876, Gregorio Chil y NaranjoGregorio Chil y Naranjo (Telde, Gran Canaria, 1831 - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1901) was a doctor, anthropologist and historian and one of the leading intellectuals on the Canary Islands at the end of the 19th century. He founded the Canary museum, to which he bequeathed most of his personal possessions. He was excommunicated in 1878 for his work on evolution in the Canary Islands entitled \"Estudios historicos, climatologicos y patol\u00f3gicos de las Islas Canarias\"; the Bishop of Barcelona, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Urquinaona y Vidot, declared the work \"falsa, impia, scandalosa y heretica\" and excommunicated the doctor. That same Studies became one of the key works on the Canary Islands and is still used as a reference to this day. briefly mentions the cave in his \"Studies\". In 1882 Diego RipocheDiego Ripoche Torrens (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1859 - 1927) studied the cave and his work made it known to the scientific community. He lived in Paris for many years. visited the cave and made drawings, some of which he may have sent to Ren\u00e9 Verneau. He also noted the presence of corpses, pots and other utensils. In 1884, Olivia StoneOlivia Stone was a British female writer. She visited the Canary islands between November 1883 and February 1884. visited the cave, made some drawings, wrote about it and suggested that the local government should acquire the site and take proper care of it. In 1887, French anthropologist Ren\u00e9 Verneau visited the cave. He wrote a detailed description in which he mentions the careful execution of each painted panel. The end of the 19th century is noted for a revival in the awareness of the importance of conservation issues for historical works. In the El Museo Canario review, chronicler Batllori y Lorenzo writes \"Mi \u00faltima tentativa\", a solemn appeal for the protection of the cave. Critics of the institutions' lack of action in that direction continue into the 20th century. But only in 1967 starts a public campaign in favour of the cave's protection - counting among its supporters Celso Mart\u00edn de Guzm\u00e1n and El\u00edas Serra R\u00e1fols. Meanwhile, the paintings were deteriorating. In 1970 the General commission of archaeological excavations (\"Comisar\u00eda General de Excavaciones Arqueol\u00f3gicas\") started working on the protection of the cave, notably on the humidity that was causing much damage. This was completed with the construction of an enclosure to protect the cave - and the public. In 1972 the site was declared Monument historique artistique. El descubrimiento de la Cueva Pintada (\"The discovery of the Painted cave\"). Antonio Beltr\u00e1n and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Alzola realized the first systematic study, published in 1974 with the first colour photographies and the most exact drawings to that date. This was another big step into spreading the knowledge of the existence of the cave among the specialists. It also helped determine the deterioration of the paintings. The plantations being watered nearby, the inadequate protection of the enclosure, the absence of planning for the visits, the chemical soil treatments for agricultural purposes and the inadequate ventilation of the premises were the main factors in increasing temperature and humidity in the cave and the subsequent damage on the paintings. Expropriation procedures were then started regarding the cultivated nearby land, and the site was closed to the public in October 1982. The Painted cave museum and archaeological park of Galdar was reopened on July 26, 2006, Conference Musealizaci\u00f3n Santiago de Compostela 2006: El Museo y Parque Arqueol\u00f3gico Cueva Pintada (G\u00e1ldar, Gran Canaria): de manzana agr\u00edcola a parque arqueol\u00f3gico urbano\" (\"the Painted cave museum and archaeological park (Galdar, Grand Canary): from an agriculture unit to an urban archaeological park\"). after 24 years excavating and restoring the site, and fitting it for public visits without further endangerment of the paintings and other historic items. Up to then it was only possible to see a reproduction of the paintings in the Canary Museum of Las Palmas in Grand Canary. Entry is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. All visits are accompanied with a guide and must be booked. Four languages are available. Cueva Pintada, official site. In 2016 the museum celebrated its 10th anniversary by sharing an exchange with the cave of Altamira museum - each museum lending to the other tens of its most valuable pieces.

It and the village next to it are located in the town that used to be the capital of the island in pre-Hispanic times.Cueva Pintada de Galdar on gobiernodecanarias.org. Excavated by humans in volcanic material, its walls are decorated with geometrical patterns.Painted cave museum on grancanaria.com. The archaeologists think that, due to their regular distribution (usually in series of twelve), they could be a sort of calendar. It is also the only location on Gran Canaria that brought the proof of the existence of common wheat on the island (triticum aestivum or triticum durum, as it is difficult to tell the difference from the seed grain).The cueva de Don Gaspar (\"Don Gaspar's cave\" in Icod, Tenerife) has revealed grains of triticum compactum (\"compact wheat\"), barley (Hordeum vulgare L. polystichum) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Bethencourt (a French adventurer from Normandy who conquered 4 of the Canaries islands at the beginning of the 15th century) wrote that in Gran Canaria there were two harvests of wheat per year, without fertilizers. See Mederos Martin & al. (2002), p. 83. Note that Grand Canary is the only Canarian island to have painted caves. === Utensils === The site also bears remains of houses, in which have been found various utensils. The collection counts among other items some notable locally-made decorated ceramic pots and paintings. It also include some ceramics made on pottery wheel on the continent as well as coins, swords, horseshoes, nails, every day use items (thimbles, knives, etc.). Painted cave, the collections on cuevapintada.com. Most coins are from the 15th and 16th centuries. It seems that all metal items were imported. Painted cave, imports on cuevapintada.com. Guanche ceramics at the Galdar Painted Cave Some pots are large and were used for storage; others were used for cooking. The local pottery was hand- made, with many of them presenting a finely polished surface and decorated with paint, generally ochre red applied before firing them in a hole in the ground. Some pots are entirely covered with geometrical patterns, in some cases including the bottom of the pots. Painted cave, the recipients on cuevapintada.com. Note that Gran Canaria is the only Canary island where painted pottery has been found. Am\u00e9lie A. Walker. Beyond the Beaches of Gran Canaria - Galdar. October 29, 1999. Beside these, are some fired clay statues of idols with human and animal figures. Most of the human idols are feminine and many are associated with maternity. In some cases the statues' bodies have been decorated with red paint and some incisions mark the hair. These could be simple offerings, amulets or toys. Painted cave, idols on cuevapintada.com. There are needles, stamps and spatulas made of sheep or goat bones; the needles are related to the making of leather clothes; the stamps and spatulas were pottery tools. Painted cave, other finds on cuevapintada.com. Objects made of stone have also been found. The stones most used are basalts, phonolites and obsidians. The stones were worked to create sharp edges with which to work other raw materials (wood, bone, skin/leather) or to carry out other works such as meat cutting or food preparation. Basalt was also used to make mortars, some round and some of elongated shapes. Some round mortars were used to grind grain for flour, some others for the red ochre that was used for the paintings and to decorate the pots.

A whole hamlet used to spread from the bottom of the valley up to the present city centre. This was one of the neighbourhoods that constituted pre-Hispanic Agaldar. The hamlet was occupied from the 6th century until the 11th century, and again from the 13th century until the 16th century and the Spanish conquest of the island. Painted cave, the village on cuevapintada.com. The houses were quadrangular and were surrounded outside by circular walls. They had one or two lateral bedrooms, opening towards the south through a small corridor. The bedrock was used to lean walls against it, and was worked to form a flat floor in the houses. The floor was further covered with packed earth or, in some cases, of stones sometimes coloured with red ochre. Painted cave, the houses on cuevapintada.com. The walls were made either of basalt or of well-dressed blocks of tuff. Nearly all the houses have kept remains of mortar and of paints of various colours that decorated the rooms. The enclave has an important role in the understanding of the final stage of pre-Hispanic Canaries - before the conquest - and the incorporation of the island to the crown of Castille. It is of note that some of the main artificial cave sites of the island are located in the relative vicinity of the Painted cave (cuevas del Hospital, Huertas del Rey or the Audience cave in the Four Doors cave site).Although a few caves were dug in isolated locations, most of them are near the sea coast and are concentrated, often in large groups. (source: Mederos Martin & al. 2002, p. 61). == Dating the site == The first carbon-14 analysis made on the cave was on the wall paintings. This gave no results because the paint used carried no trace of carbon, being entirely non-organic (ochre). Then some vegetal remains of a plant from the family Lauraceae were found in the mortar in the walls. These remains were analysed by the CSIC laboratory and that of the French CNRS, and dated between 1049 and 1257 A.C. Some fragments of pine tree were dated between 601 and 994.La cueva pintada de G\u00e1ldar tiene mil a\u00f1os (\"The Painted cave is 1,000 years old\"). El Mundo, 03/07/2013.
