Mortlock was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly at the 1896 election, winning his father's old seat of Flinders. He re-entered parliament in 1901, winning a by- election for Flinders caused by the election of Alexander Poynton to the inaugural Australian House of Representatives at the 1901 federal election. However, he was again defeated at the 1902 election.
