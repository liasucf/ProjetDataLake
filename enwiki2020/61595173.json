In April 2019, a disaster recovery plan to support the Central Queensland communities affected by the 2018 bushfires was released by the Queensland Government. Following a request by State Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, Craig Crawford, for a review into the effectiveness of the Queensland disaster management system in its preparation and response to the bushfires, the Inspector-General of Emergency Management, Iain Mackenzie, delivered the independent 2018 Queensland Bushfires Review Report in June 2019.Mackenzie, Iain (3 June 2019) The 2018 Queensland Bushfires Review (PDF), Report 2: 2018-2019, Office of the Inspector-General of Emergency Management.

Retrieved 24 August 2019. Frecklington said the report failed to address key disaster prevention concerns, while Millar said it was unacceptable the report didn't make any recommendations relating to issues surrounding the alleged mismanagement of state-controlled land and the timely approval of fire permits. Littleproud said the state government needed to apologise to farmers as the report had found landholders couldn't clear appropriate fire breaks without breaking the government's vegetation management laws. == References == Category:Bushfires in Queensland Category:Disasters in Queensland Category:2018 disasters in Australia ",
