    "text": "The Scotland-GDR Society was an association based in Scotland, dedicated to promoting relations with the German Democratic Republic. The organization was founded on September 6, 1986, as the six Scottish local branches of the Britain-GDR Society broke away and formed their own organization. The foundation of the Scotland-GDR Society had been preceded by tensions within the Britain-GDR Society in the 1980s. Whilst the Britain-GDR Society had failed to make any major inroads in British politics, its Scottish branches had managed to build a significant network among the Scottish left-wing movement. Led by Marlene Smith and Peter Smith, the Scottish branches of the society had a degree of autonomy. It had mainly been active in Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen.David Childs, The Other Germany: Perceptions and Influences in British-East German Relations, 1945-1990, The English Historical Review, Volume CXXII, Issue 499, December 2007, Pages 1470\u20131472 And the East Germans had become increasing frustrated with the Eurocommunist leadership in the Britain-GDR Society, leading to splits in the organization. The Scotland-GDR Society held its first national congress on March 20, 1988. As of 1988, the organization had 550 members. As of 1990, Peter Smith served as the secretary of the Scotland-GDR Society. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1986 Category:East Germany friendship associations Category:Germany\u2013United Kingdom relations ",
