    "text": "Netta Syrett (17 March 1865 \u2013 15 December 1943) was an English writer of the late Victorian period whose novels featured New Woman protagonists. Her novel Portrait of a Rebel was adapted into the 1936 film A Woman Rebels. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Netta Syrett was born Janet Syrett on 17 March 1865 in Ramsgate, Kent. She was one of five daughters (of thirteen children) born to silk merchant Ernest Syrett (d.1906) and Mary Ann, n\u00e9e Stembridge (d.1923) and the niece of writer Grant Allen. Three of her sisters, Nellie Syrett (b. 1882) Kate Syrett and Mabel Syrett (1871 \u2013 1961), were artists, designers and illustrators First educated at home by their mother and a German governess, Syrett left home at age 11 to attend North London Collegiate School. She continued her education at Hughes Hall, Cambridge where she completed the three years' coursework necessary for a full teaching certificate in one year.(2006) \"Netta Syrett\" in Jill Tedford Jones: Dictionary of Literary Biography. Gale Thomson. ===Career=== Syrett taught for two years at a school in Swansea before accepting a post at the London Polytechnic School for Girls. Through her friend and coworker Mabel Beardsley, Netta met Aubrey Beardsley, Mabel's brother, and through him she was introduced to Henry Harland and included in his circle of friends. Harland published three of her short stories in the Yellow Book. her sisters Nellie Syrett and Mabel Syrett also contributed to the Yellow Book. Syrett's first novel, Nobody's Fault (1896), was published by The Bodley Head in their Keynote series. Her writing and teaching careers coincided until 1902, when her play The Finding of Nancy received negative attention after Clement Scott, writing for the Daily Telegraph (9 May 1902), insinuated that the play was thinly disguised autobiography. Syrett was asked to resign her teaching position after a student's mother read Scott's review. By that time, novel writing had become for her \"a sure thing\" and Syrett continued to turn out a novel per year until retiring in 1939. ===Death and afterward=== Syrett died in London on 15 December 1943 following a long illness. ==Published works== ===Novels=== *Nobody's Fault (1896) *The Tree of Life (1897) *Rosanne (1902) *The Day's Journey (1905) *The Child of Promise (1907) *Anne Page (1908) *A Castle of Dreams (1909) *Olivia L.
