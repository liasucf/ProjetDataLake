In 1963, they hosted a poetry conference attended by Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Duncan, Margaret Avison, Robert Creeley, and Philip Whalen.Description of the Vancouver 1963 Poetry Conference ; www.slought.org The Tallman home itself also served as a poetry enclave of sorts. It was in the Tallman home that Jack Spicer gave some of his now legendary lectures.See Peter Gizzi Two years later, they held another poetry conference in Berkeley, California. Tallman was sometimes criticized for turning the Vancouver poetry circle into a California branch plant. Tallman embraced the Black Mountain school approach to poetry, but also showed the influence of the Beats, the New American Poets and the Language Poets. Among the Canadian poets he is said to have influenced are bill bissett, Stan Persky and Howard White. ==Selected bibliography== * The Poetics of the New American Poetry New York: Grove, 1973.
