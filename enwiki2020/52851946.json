The exact origin of the \"Cool S\" is unknown, but it may have originated from geometry textbooks and has appeared around the early 1970s as a part of graffiti culture. Contrary to popular belief, the symbol has no ties to either the U.S. clothing brand St\u00fcssy or to the character Superman, though St\u00fcssy did conduct an interview in 2010 with Jon Naar, a pioneer graffiti photographer with many works including this S, dating back to the 1970s. ==Shape== The \"Cool S\" consists of 14 line segments, forming a stylized, pointed S-shape. It has also been compared to the infinity symbol. The \"tails\" (pointy ends) of the S appear to link underneath so that it loops around on itself in the same way as the infinity symbol does. The \"Cool S\" has no reflection symmetry, but has 2-fold rotational symmetry. As illustrated, a common way to draw the shape begins with two sets of three parallel, vertical lines, one above the other. ==History== ===Origin=== The origin of the \"Cool S\" is unclear. A similar- looking symbol appears in the 1890 book Mechanical Graphics. \"Double 'S' markings\" also appear in the 1982 painting Portrait of the Artist as a Young Derelict by Jean-Michel Basquiat. The name \"Superman S\" comes from a belief that it was a symbol for Superman, whose costume features a stylized \"S\" in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Although frequently referred to as the \"St\u00fcssy S\", Emmy Coats (who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985) has stated that it was never a symbol of the Californian surf company. David W\u00e5ngstedt, better known online as LEMMiNO, studied the topic for 5 years and attempted to find the origin of the S, but he concluded that the 1890 book Mechanical Graphics which was written by professor Frederick Newton Willson could most likely be the origin. Frederick taught geometry at Princeton University in New Jersey, where he could have shown students how to draw the S.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdxHi4_Pvc ===Spread=== Paul Cobley, Professor in Language and Media at Middlesex University in London, England, provided an explanation for the prevalence of the \"Cool S\": \"That is, it's fun to draw.\" Preston Zhou, a graduate student at Harvard University, expressed that the \"'Cool S' is a simply amazing, profound statement on humanity.\" ==See also== * Henohenomoheji * Emoticon * Twin mountain drawing * Suzuki * Kilroy was here * Sator Square ==References== Category:Drawing Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage Category:Topology Category:Youth culture ",
