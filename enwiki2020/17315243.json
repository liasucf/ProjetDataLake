    "text": "Ravensden is a village and civil parish located in the Borough of Bedford in Bedfordshire, England. The parish borders the town of Bedford, with Mowsbury Park, farmland and Freeman's Common acting as a buffer between the two settlements. The village hosts Ravensden Primary School, and a pub called The Horse and Jockey, as well as All Saints Church. There is also a village hall. For elections to Bedford Borough Council, Ravensden is part of Great Barford ward. A housing estate called Woodlands Park was established in the southern part of Ravensden parish in the late 2000s. The estate is separated from the village by farmland, with vehicular access to the community coming from the Brickhill area of Bedford. In April 2015 Woodlands Park became part of Brickhill parish, but remains part of Great Barford ward for elections to Bedford Borough Council. ==References== ==External links== * Ravensden community site Category:Villages in Bedfordshire Category:Civil parishes in Bedfordshire Category:Borough of Bedford ",
