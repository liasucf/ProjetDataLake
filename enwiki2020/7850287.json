The collection exceeds 190 aircraft, with some being the last survivors of their type. Yanks restores all aircraft to airworthy condition, and in the restoration of these rare aircraft only original factory specifications and materials are used. The Chino facility encompasses under roof and covers . In addition to the display hangars, public access is permitted, on a supervised basis, to the main restoration hangar and boneyard where historic aircraft are in various stages of restoration. Some of the aircraft will not be flown due to their rarity, but are restored to fully airworthy condition. ==Greenfield project== Work is now underway to create a second Yanks Air Museum facility in Greenfield, California. The facility will include , the campus will be centered on the new museum facility.
