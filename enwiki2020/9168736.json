She was the author of many books on Egyptian art and history and was also known for her role in the preservation of the Nubian temples from flooding caused by the Aswan Dam. ==Background== She was born Christiane Desroches on 17 November 1913, in Paris. In 1922 she was fascinated by Howard Carter\u2019s discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamon, and encouraged by Father \u00c9tienne Drioton, she joined the Egyptian Antiquities department at the Louvre. She was the first woman to be a fellow of the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology (IFAO), and was also the first woman to lead an archaeological dig, in 1938. During World War II she joined the Resistance, and hid the Louvre's Egyptian treasures in free areas of France. She died on 23 June 2011 at 97. ==Aswan Dam project== The construction of the new Aswan High Dam led to Noblecourt's greatest accomplishment: the preservation of ancient Nubian temples from flooding caused by the dam. The first dam, completed in 1902 with a capacity of a billion cubic meters, had been deemed insufficient and raised in 1912, and again in 1934. The dam's capacity still could not meet the needs of Egypt's ever-growing population, and in 1954 the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser decided to build a new dam with a capacity of 157 billion cubic meters, 500 kilometers long, which would extend into Sudan. It has been described as a project worthy of the pharaohs. The monuments of ancient Nubia would have been flooded and lost forever if the project had gone ahead as planned, among them the temples of Abu Simbel. In the words of writer Pierre Loti, who visited the area shortly after the first dam was completed: > \u201cThe greater part of the ancient temples of Nubia will be underwater...but > the cotton fields will be so productive!\u201d UNESCO immediately asked Noblecourt, who was then curator of Egyptian antiquities at the Louvre, to create an inventory of all the threatened historical sites. It then undertook the colossal task of finding the funding necessary to save them. ===UNESCO's Campaign to \u064dSave the Temples=== On March 8, 1960, Christiane Desroches Noblecourt, along with Sarwat Okasha, the Egyptian Minister of Culture, made a formal appeal for international support. Not only would more than fourteen temples have to be moved, but urgent excavations would need to take place at sites that would soon be under several dozen meters of water. Andr\u00e9 Malraux, then the French Minister of Cultural Affairs, added his voice to the appeal: > \u201cThe power that created the colossal monuments threatened today... speaks to > us in a voice as exalted as that of the architects of Chartres, as that of > Rembrandt... Your appeal is historic, not because it proposes to save the > temples of Nubia, but because through it the first global civilization > publicly claims the world's art as its indivisible heritage... There is only > one action over which the indifference of stars and the eternal murmuring of > rivers have no sway\u2014 it is the act by which man snatches something from > death.\u201d Fifty countries contributed funds to save the monuments now considered part of the heritage of all humanity. Philae, Kalabsha, Wadi al-Sabua, Dakka, Derr and other sites were moved, with the temples of Abu Simbel receiving the most media attention. The temple of Amada was a difficult case, because of its small, beautifully painted reliefs. Chopping it into blocks, as was being done with the other temples, was not an option; the paintings would not have survived. Seeing that all seemed resigned to see the temple flooded by the silty waters of Lake Nasser, Christiane Desroches Noblecourt announced that France would save it. She asked two architects to propose a method for moving the temple in one piece. Their idea was to put the temple on rails and transport it hydraulically to a site a few kilometers away that was more than 60 meters higher. More funds were needed for this ambitious project. To this end Christiane Desroches Noblecourt requested an interview with Charles de Gaulle, who had no idea of the commitment she had made in the name of her country. Reportedly on learning of it, he demanded, \u201cMadame, how dare you say that France will save the temple, without authorization from my government?\u201d Noblecourt replied, \u201cGeneral, how dare you make an appeal on the radio without authorization from P\u00e9tain?\u201d De Gaulle agreed to honour Noblecourt's promise. Ultimately the rescue project, including the transportation and reconstruction of the temples on their new sites, took twenty years. ===Aftermath=== The preservation of the Nubian monuments was to have unexpected consequences. The first was an improvement in Franco-Egyptian relations, which had been poor since the Suez Canal crisis of 1956. This in turn led to the organization of a Tutankhamon exhibition at the Louvre in 1967, which attracted a record number of visitors, followed by the exhibitions of Ramses II in 1976, and Amenophis III in 1993. In recognition of France's contributions to the preservation of the Nubian temples, the government of Anwar Sadat donated to the Louvre the bust of Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhenaton. ==Awards== In 1975 Christiane Desroches Noblecourt received the prestigious gold medal of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). In January 2008, she was awarded the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, the highest decoration in France. * Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur * Officer of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite * M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance * Commander of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques * Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres * Grand Officer of the Order of the Liberation of Egypt * Gold Medal of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) (1975) * Great Silver Medal of UNESCO * Vermeil Medal of the City of Paris * Great Gold Medal of the Society for Encouraging Progress * Silver Medal of the Academy of Architecture ==See also== *Aswan Dam *List of Egyptologists ==Publications== * With K.Michalowski, Tell-Edfou 1939.
