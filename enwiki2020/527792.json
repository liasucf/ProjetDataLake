    "text": "La Presse, founded in 1884, is a French-language digital newspaper published daily in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is owned by a social trust. La Presse was a broadsheet daily published seven days a week. Its Sunday edition was discontinued in 2009, and the weekday edition in 2016. The weekend Saturday printed edition was discontinued on 31 December 2017, turning La Presse into an entirely digital newspaper marketed as La Presse+ (pronounced La Presse Plus). La Presse is also available on the web: lapresse.ca as well as on mobile: La Presse Mobile. ==Description== La Presse is a digital newspaper as well as a website and a mobile app, aimed at an educated, middle-class readership. Its main competitor is the daily tabloid Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, which aims at a more populist audience. La Presse comprises several sections, dealing individually with arts, sports, business and economy and other themes. Its Saturday print edition (now discontinued) contained over 10 sections. The newspaper's website, www.lapresse.ca, operates as a company-wide portal which publishes news and editorial content. ==History== La Presse offices in Old Montreal. The black plate to the right of the door shows the logo used from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. The logo over the door was used from the late 1980s until the 1990s. The paper was founded on October 20, 1884 by William- Edmond Blumhart. Treffl\u00e9 Berthiaume took over in 1889. The fledgling newspaper's circulation would soon pass that of its main competitor of the time, La Patrie. In April 1901, the paper organized a cruise to Quebec City (Croisi\u00e8re de La Presse). It also organized a charity to give Christmas gifts to poor children (L'Oeuvre des \u00e9trennes aux enfants pauvres). A front-page illustration on December 3, 1904 issue celebrated the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The practice of the time was to have an illustration on the front page, rather than a photograph. Between July 1971 and February 1972, La Presse endured a seven-month labour dispute between its then-owner Power Corporation of Canada and 11 trade unions caused by the introduction of new printing technology that could have potentially jeopardized the job security of newspaper typographers. This resulted in La Presse not being printed between October 28, 1971 and February 9, 1972, with the entire dispute culminating in a over 10,000-strong protest in Downtown Montreal on October 29, 1971, resulting in over 200 injuries and arrests, as well as the death of the 28-year-old Mich\u00e8le Gauthier, a student at C\u00e9gep du Vieux Montr\u00e9al, who was caught up in the protests. The style and presentation have changed immensely during the course of the 20th century. It underwent a complete graphic remodelling in 1986, and again in 2003. From 1984 to 2014, La Presse every year honoured a \"Person of the Year,\" for example, Julie Payette, Daniel Langlois and Ga\u00e9tan Boucher. In 1984, it also published a commemorative book in order to celebrate its 100th anniversary. A similar book was published by \u00c9ditions La Presse to recap the major events of the 20th century. In 2001, with the arrival of news editor Guy Crevier, the newspaper began a radical remodelling.\"Paper war spurs lurid reporting\". The Globe and Mail, October 17, 2003. The graphic design was modernized, new sections were created, international coverage was greatly increased, and many new young, up- and-coming journalists were hired. These changes had a significant positive impact on quality and circulation, to the point that the paper is now considered a rival to Le Devoir for the title of Quebec's newspaper of record. In 2011, La Presse was chosen as the flagship brand and leveraged on all media platforms. Cyberpresse.ca becomes LaPresse.ca. In 2013, La Presse launched La Presse+, an all-new free digital edition for iPad that redefined the way users get their information. Founded in May 2015, Nuglif is a subsidiary of La Presse and the platform aims at replicating the La Presse+ business model for other publications in the daily news industry through a suite of publishing software and tools for delivery on both iPads and Android tablets.https://nuglif.com/en/index.html The newspaper announced in September 2015 that it would end its weekday print edition in 2016 and that thereafter the weekday paper would be available only in digital form.Filloux, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Inside La Presse+ Decisive and Final Move to Digital Monday Note. January 13, 2016 The Saturday edition continued in print until 2017. Its last Saturday print edition was published on December 30, 2017. On May 8, 2018, it was announced that La Presse would become a nonprofit organization and sever ties with its owner, Power Corporation. This move allowed the newspaper to accept private donations and governmental support. ==Editorial line== La Presses offices in Old Montreal with 1986\u20131999 logo. The editorial board of La Presse has been consistently supportive of Canadian federalism over the past 25 years, though individual columnists may freely express less sympathy. The newspaper's editorials endorsed the federalist option in both the 1980 Quebec referendum and the 1995 Quebec referendum which were held on the issue of Quebec's national-sovereignism. The editorial board leaves room for the whole spectrum of opinions. It supported same-sex marriage legislation in Canada, the protests against the War in Iraq, and criticized both sides in the 2012 Quebec student protests. The paper endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2006 election.https://www.cbc.ca/news2/canada/politicalbytes/2008/10/whom-to- endorse.html This was primarily out of a reasoning that the Canadian government was in need of a necessary change after more than 12 years of Liberal rule. Similarly, with Stephen Harper's Conservatives having been in power for nine years at the time, La Presse endorsed Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party in the 2015 election.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/la-presse- justin-trudeau-1.3260030 Fran\u00e7ois Cardinal is currently the editor-in-chief. Noted journalists associated with the paper include Patrick Lagac\u00e9, Yves Boisvert, Agn\u00e8s Gruda and Lysiane Gagnon. ==Television== The newspaper's television production arm, La Presse T\u00e9l\u00e9, has produced the series Dumont, hosted by former politician Mario Dumont, for the Quebec television network V (formerly TQS).\"Mario Dumont to host Quebec TV show\". cbc.ca, February 25, 2009. This division, that had changed its name to LP8 M\u00e9dia, was sold to Attraction Images in 2014. ==See also== *List of Quebec media *List of newspapers in Canada ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Publications established in 1884 Category:French-language newspapers published in Quebec Category:Gesca Limit\u00e9e publications Category:Newspapers published in Montreal Category:Daily newspapers published in Quebec Category:1884 establishments in Quebec Category:Online newspapers with defunct print editions ",
