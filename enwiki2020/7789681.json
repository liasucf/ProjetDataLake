    "text": "Hungarian peng\u0151 paper money () was part of the physical form of Hungary's historical currency, the Hungarian peng\u0151. Paper money usually meant banknotes, which were issued (either in fact or in name) by the Hungarian National Bank. Later \u2013 during and after World War II \u2013 other types of paper money appeared, including emergency money, bonds and savings certificates. Initially, paper money was designed abroad, and printed using simple methods. Later, more advanced techniques were used, creating banknotes which reflected stability. After the war, in parallel with their loss in value, the quality of banknotes decreased. Finally, not even serial numbers were printed on the notes. ==Banknotes== ===First series (1926)=== The first series of peng\u0151 banknotes were printed in 1926 in the following denominations: 5 P, 10 P, 20 P, 50 P, and 100 P. All these banknotes were designed by Ferenc Helbing. Due to the poor printing technology (offset printing) counterfeits appeared in a short time. The situation was so serious that the banknotes soon had to be replaced with a new series. As a consequence, these belong to the most valued collector rarities among Hungarian banknotes. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" !colspan=\"9\"| 1926 series |- !colspan=\"2\"| Image !!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"3\"| Date of |- !

First, the 100 P bill of 1930 and the 10 P bill of 1936 were reprinted in late 1944. These banknotes were marked with a star in the serial number (1 peng\u0151 bills of 1938 with a star in the serial number are not Veszpr\u00e9m issues), and are much less common than those without it. Some of the 100 P banknotes were overstamped with a 1000 P adhesive stamp \u2013 these were later replaced by the 1000 P bill of 1943. Later in 1944 there was a plan to issue a new series of 10, 100 and 1000 P banknotes \u2013 all designed by Endre Horv\u00e1th. Due to lack of time, only the 1000 P bill was officially put into circulation, 100 P bills were printed but only used by the evacuated troops in Austria, the 10 P bill is only known as printer's proof. The 100 and 1000 P bills were designed using elements of earlier banknotes. In the last days of the Sz\u00e1lasi government, some of the bills (10 P of 1936, 20 P of 1941, 50 P of 1932, 100 P of 1930 and 1000 P of 1943) were overstamped with a green arrow- cross stamp \u2013 however, most of these overstamped banknotes are considered to be fake (i.e. overstamped later to turn these common banknotes into more expensive 'rarities') : stamp inks are tend to be very fresh on these banknotes and it is not clear what the purpose of such overstamping would have been. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" !colspan=\"9\"| 1943 series |- !colspan=\"2\"| Image !!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"3\"| Date of |- !

There was little time to design new notes, so the plates of banknotes printed in 1926 were reused (compare the 50, 100, and notes with the 50, 100, 20 and 10 peng\u0151 notes from the 1926 series, respectively) as well as portraits from other notes (e.g. compare the 500 peng\u0151 note with the korona note and the peng\u0151 note with the 2 peng\u0151 note from 1940). Beginning with the 1000 peng\u0151 note, only denominations of integer powers of ten were used. The uncontrolled issue of banknotes aggravated inflation. In December 1945, the government tried (and failed) to bring inflation under control by a one-off capital levy. This meant that the 1000, and peng\u0151 banknotes had to be overstamped with a stamp that could be bought for 3 times the value of the banknote. Unstamped banknotes were worth a quarter of their nominal value after this campaign. Later the peng\u0151 note was issued again in different colors \u2013 this banknote and higher denominations did not fall under the capital levy. Although there were plans to issue 10 billion (1010) peng\u0151 notes (similar in design to the 1946-version 10 Ft note), denominations higher than one billion were renamed milpeng\u0151 (which stands for million peng\u0151) and the indicated value was reduced by a factor of one million. The next denomination after the one billion peng\u0151 note became the milpeng\u0151, which was equal to ten thousand million peng\u0151, and had a similar design to the peng\u0151 note. The aim was to ease everyday money handling and accounting as well as to reuse the designs of earlier banknotes with little changes. After the one billion milpeng\u0151 note a new abbreviation had to be used, since further higher denominations were necessary. This became the b.-peng\u0151 (which stands for billion peng\u0151; billion is on the long scale i.e. one million million) and the designs could be reused again with changes in the color and adding \"B\" letters. The highest printed denomination \u2013 the one billion b.-peng\u0151 (i.e. 1021 peng\u0151) note \u2013 was never released into circulation. This naming scheme and reuse of the designs is the reason for the cyclic pattern in the hyperinflation peng\u0151 notes. The cycle was 6 digit, meaning that notes with the same number before the denomination (e.g. peng\u0151, milpeng\u0151, , b.-peng\u0151) had the same design. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" !colspan=\"9\"|1945\u20131946 series |- !colspan=\"2\"| Image !!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"3\"| Date of |- !
