His hand is accidentally scratched and becomes infected with a deadly poison invented by Milton Norworth (Buckley), who is Jane's brother. A professor with the only antidote for the poison is en route to Russia, so Dwight rushes to intercept him. An attempt is made to kidnap Dwight and hold him for ransom, but he escapes by jumping off a moving train and unmounting a Russian on a passing horse and riding away. In the meantime Jane learns that the poison was in fact harmless, but that the antidote if taken would kill him. She goes to Russia and then follows him to Spain as Dwight attempts to catch up with the professor. When he reaches the professor, Dwight finds him too deaf to understand him. Jane arrives in time to stop Dwight from taking the antidote. ==Cast== *Tom Mix as Dwight Locke *Eva Novak as Jane Norworth *William Buckley as Milton Norworth *Sid Jordan as Velvet Joe *Elsie Danbric as Princess Sonia *Wynn Mace as Prince Albert ==Production== A film magazine stated that several of the action scenes involving Dwight Locke in Chasing the Moon were from other Tom Mix films, including at least one scene lifted from Sky High (1922). ==References== ==External links== * * *Lantern slide (Wayback Machine) Category:1922 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Lost American films Category:Films directed by Edward Sedgwick Category:Fox Film films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American drama films Category:1922 drama films Category:1922 lost films Category:Lost drama films ",
