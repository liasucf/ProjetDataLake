The Pietroasele Treasure (or the Petrossa Treasure) found in Pietroasele, Buz\u0103u, Romania, in 1837, is a late fourth-century Gothic treasure that included some twenty-two objects of gold, among the most famous examples of the polychrome style of Migration Period art. Of the twenty-two pieces, only twelve have survived, conserved at the National Museum of Romanian History, in Bucharest: a large eagle-headed fibula and three smaller ones encrusted with semi-precious stones; a patera, or round sacrificial dish, modelled with Orphic figures Campbell, Joseph.

Their multiple styles, in which Han Chinese styles have been noted in the belt buckles, Hellenistic styles in the golden bowls, Sasanian motifs in the baskets, and Germanic fashions in the fibulae,Herbert K\u00fchn, \"Asiatic Influences on the Art of the Migrations\" Parnassus 9.1 (January 1937, pp. 13-16, 43) p. 14 are characteristic of the cosmopolitan outlook of the Cernjachov culture in a region without defined topographic confines. When Alexandru Odobescu published his book on the treasure,Odobescu, Alexandru, Le Tr\u00e9sor de Petrossa, Paris, 1889-1900. he considered that such magnificent work could only have belonged to Athanaric (died 381), leader of the Thervings, a Gothic people. Modern archaeologists cannot connect the hoard with such a glamorous name. The treasure was shipped to Russia in December 1916, as German armies advanced through Romania in World War I, and was not returned until 1956. An atomic analysis of the Pietroasele gold hoard has concluded that from the point of view of Ir/Au, Cu/Au and Ag/Au concentrations the three styles are clustered. At least from the iridium concentration data, the assumption of a Dacian provenance of the hoard raw material is highly improbable as also the hypothesis that Roman imperial gold coins were used for manufacturing Pietroasa artifacts is not in accordance with the elemental concentrations.Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 240 (1999) 897 NUCLEAR ANALYSES OF THE PIETROASA GOLD HOARD, Viorel Cojocaru, C\u00e3lin Besliu and Cristina Anton Manea ==See also== * Ring of Pietroassa * Treasure of Osztr\u00f3pataka * Romanian Treasure ==Notes== ==External links== *Pietroasele treasure, at the National Museum of Romanian History *Illustrations *Coins depicting the treasure *A great gold eagle brooch *Vivid: Romania through international eyes, Tim Judy, \"The treasure of the Pietroasa\" Part I: December 2005 Part II: January 2006 Category:Goths Category:Germanic archaeological artifacts Category:Treasure troves of Late Antiquity Category:Archaeological discoveries in Romania Category:Art and cultural repatriation Pietroasele Category:1837 archaeological discoveries ",
