    "text": "The 2017 Rutland, Vermont mayoral election was held March 6, 2017. David Allaire was elected to his first term with 51.85% of the popular vote, defeating incumbent mayor Christopher Louras. ==Background== Incumbent mayor Christopher Louras was first elected in 2007. In April 2016, Louras announced a program to bring up to 100 refugees of the Syrian Civil War from Syria and surrounding countries to the city to be housed. Rutland Board of Alders member David Allaire was a strong critic of both the program and its implementation. Candidate Michael Coppinger, a Rutland downtown development advocate, was in favor of such a program but had issues with Louras' specific program and announcing the program quickly without public input. ==Election Results== ==References== Category:2017 United States mayoral elections Category:Mayoral elections in Rutland, Vermont Category:2017 Vermont elections ",
