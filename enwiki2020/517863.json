    "text": "The S\u00e3o Francisco boardwalk S\u00e3o Francisco is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the Brazilian city of Niter\u00f3i is divided. As of 2000, its population was 9,654. Its name derives from the church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier (in Portuguese: S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier) and references to it can be found as early as the 17th century. The S\u00e3o Francisco Ensenada, also known as \"saco\" de S\u00e3o Francisco\" (roughly translated as S\u00e3o Francisco's \"bag\", on account of the Ensenada's shape), was an important source of fish for both the Indians and the Portuguese. In the 19th century, an important road existed, connecting the neighborhood of Icara\u00ed, across the Morro do Caval\u00e3o (Big Horse Hill), to Charitas and then across the Morro da Vira\u00e7\u00e3o (Vira\u00e7\u00e3o Hill) to Piratininga, on the Ocean shore (note that Icara\u00ed, S\u00e3o Francisco and Charitas have their shores on the Guanabara Bay). The population of approximately 9,620 (in 1991) represents 2.21% of Niter\u00f3i's total population. No slums exist in the neighborhood. S\u00e3o Francisco is also the home of Marcelo Morcego and Rico Chilinque. The S\u00e3o Francisco waterfront is famous for its concentration of bars, restaurants and night clubs, being the beating heart of Niter\u00f3i's nightlife. ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods of Niter\u00f3i ",
