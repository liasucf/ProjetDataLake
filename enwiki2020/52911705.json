    "text": "Irene Hardy Clark is a Navajo Native American weaver. Her matrilineal clan is Tjbahj (water's edge people) and her patrilineal clan is Honjghjahnii (he walks around one people). Her technique and style is primarily self-taught, incorporating contemporary and traditional themes. Her mother, Glenebah Hardy, mentored her in traditional techniques. Clark processes the sheep's wool used in her weavings by washing, cleaning, carding and hand spinning it. She then dyes it with plant and lichen dyes, and uses an upright steel loom to create the weaving. Clark's work has been exhibited in museums, art galleries and has been featured as the subject of the 1991 film, Weavers, by DeSciose Productions, Denver. Clark is a traditional teacher, having shared her knowledge of weaving and techniques to several generations. ==Exhibitions== Clark has exhibited her work at the Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff; Kennedy Museum of Art at Ohio University; and had three works in a traveling exhibition originating at the Denver Art Museum, Contemporary Navajo Weaving: The Gloria F.
