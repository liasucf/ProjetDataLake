    "text": "In metaphysics, realism about a given object is the view that this object exists in reality independently of our conceptual scheme. In philosophical terms, these objects are ontologically independent of someone's conceptual scheme, perceptions, linguistic practices, beliefs, etc. Realism can be applied to many philosophically interesting objects and phenomena: other minds, the past or the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the physical world, and thought. Realism can also be a view about the nature of reality in general, where it claims that the world exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of skepticism and solipsism, which question our ability to assert the world is independent of our mind). Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.The statement veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus (\"truth is the adequation of thought and thing\") was defended by Thomas Aquinas. Realists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality but that the accuracy and fullness of understanding can be improved.Blackburn p. 188 In some contexts, realism is contrasted with idealism. Today it is more usually contrasted with anti- realism, for example in the philosophy of science. The oldest use of the term \"realism\" appears in medieval scholastic interpretations and adaptations of ancient Greek philosophy. ==Etymology== The term comes from Late Latin realis \"real\" and was first used in the abstract metaphysical sense by Immanuel Kant in 1781 (CPR A 369).Heidemann, D. \"Kant and the forms of realism\". Synthese (2019). ==Varieties== ===Metaphysical realism=== Metaphysical realism maintains that \"whatever exists does so, and has the properties and relations it does, independently of deriving its existence or nature from being thought of or experienced.\"Laird Addis, Greg Jesson, Erwin Tegtmeier (eds.), Ontology and Analysis: Essays and Recollections about Gustav Bergmann, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, p. 107. ===Naive or direct realism=== Naive realism, also known as direct realism, is a philosophy of mind rooted in a common sense theory of perception that claims that the senses provide us with direct awareness of the external world. In contrast, some forms of idealism assert that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas and some forms of skepticism say we cannot trust our senses. The naive realist view is that objects have properties, such as texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived absolutely correctly. We perceive them as they really are. ===Scientific realism=== Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be explained?\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables. Analytic philosophers generally have a commitment to scientific realism, in the sense of regarding the scientific method as a reliable guide to the nature of reality. The main alternative to scientific realism is instrumentalism.Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) ====Scientific realism in physics==== Realism in physics (especially quantum mechanics) is the claim that the world is in some sense mind-independent: that even if the results of a possible measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer (contrary to the \"consciousness causes collapse\" interpretation of quantum mechanics). That interpretation of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, states that the wave function is already the full description of reality. The different possible realities described by the wave function are equally true. The observer collapses the wave function into their own reality. One's reality can be mind-dependent under this interpretation of quantum mechanics. ===Moral realism=== Moral realism is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world. ===Aesthetic realism=== Aesthetic realism (not to be confused with Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy developed by Eli Siegel, or \"realism\" in the arts) is the view that there are mind-independent aesthetic facts.Nick Zangwill, The Metaphysics of Beauty, Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 3. ==History of metaphysical realism== ===Ancient Greek philosophy=== Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of The School of Athens, a fresco by Raphael. In Plato's metaphysics, ever unchanging Forms, or Ideas, exist apart from particular things, and are related to them as their prototype or exemplar. Aristotle's philosophy of reality also aims at the universal. Aristotle finds the universal, which he calls essence, in the commonalities of particular things. In ancient Greek philosophy, realist doctrines about universals were proposed by Plato and Aristotle.Realism \u2013 philosophy \u2013 Britannica.com Platonic realism is realism regarding the existence of universals or abstract objects. As universals were considered by Plato to be ideal forms, this stance is confusingly also called Platonic idealism. This should not be confused with Idealism, as presented by philosophers such as George Berkeley: as Platonic abstractions are not spatial, temporal, or mental, they are not compatible with the latter Idealism's emphasis on mental existence. Plato's Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making them a theory of mathematical realism; they also include the Form of the Good, making them in addition a theory of ethical realism. Aristotelian realism is the view that the existence of universals is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them. ===Medieval philosophy=== Medieval realism developed out of debates over the problem of universals.John Marenbon, Medieval Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 72. Universals are terms or properties that can be applied to many things, such as \"red\", \"beauty\", \"five\", or \"dog\". Realism (also known as exaggerated realism) in this context, contrasted with conceptualism and nominalism, holds that such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. Moderate realism holds that they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist separately from the specific thing. Conceptualism holds that they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism holds that universals do not \"exist\" at all but are no more than words (flatus vocis) that describe specific objects. Proponents of moderate realism included Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Duns Scotus (cf. Scotist realism).Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism \u2013 Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) ===Early modern philosophy=== In early modern philosophy, Scottish Common Sense Realism was a school of philosophy that sought to defend naive realism against philosophical paradox and scepticism, arguing that matters of common sense are within the reach of common understanding and that common- sense beliefs even govern the lives and thoughts of those who hold non- commonsensical beliefs. It originated in the ideas of the most prominent members of the Scottish School of Common Sense, Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson and Dugald Stewart, during the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Scotland and America. The roots of Scottish Common Sense Realism can be found in responses to such philosophers as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The approach was a response to the \"ideal system\" that began with Descartes' concept of the limitations of sense experience and led Locke and Hume to a skepticism that called religion and the evidence of the senses equally into question. The common sense realists found skepticism to be absurd and so contrary to common experience that it had to be rejected. They taught that ordinary experiences provide intuitively certain assurance of the existence of the self, of real objects that could be seen and felt and of certain \"first principles\" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. Its basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid (2004) p 85 :If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them\u2014these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd. ===Late modern philosophy=== In late modern philosophy, a notable school of thought advocating metaphysical realism was Austrian realism. Its members included Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Vittorio Benussi, Ernst Mally,Liliana Albertazzi, Dale Jacquette, The School of Alexius Meinong, Routledge, 2017, p. 191. and early Edmund Husserl.Gestalt Theory: Official Journal of the Society for Gestalt Theory and Its Applications (GTA), 22, Steinkopff, 2000, p. 94: \"Attention has varied between Continental Phenomenology (late Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) and Austrian Realism (Brentano, Meinong, Benussi, early Husserl)\". These thinkers stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it.Mark Textor, The Austrian Contribution to Analytic Philosophy, Routledge, 2006, pp. 170\u20131: \"[Husserl argues in the Logical Investigations that the rightness of a judgement or proposition] shows itself in our experience of self-evidence (Evidenz), which term Husserl takes from Brentano, but makes criterial not of truth per se but of our most secure awareness that things are as we take them to be, when the object of judgement, the state of affairs, is given most fully or adequately. ... In his struggle to overcome relativism, especially psychologism, Husserl stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it ... A proposition is true not because of some fact about a thinker but because of an objectively existing abstract proposition's relation to something that is not a proposition, namely a state of affairs.\" (See also Graz School.) Dialectical materialism, a philosophy of nature based on the writings of late modern philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is interpreted to be a form of ontological realism.Sean Creaven, Marxism and Realism: A Materialistic Application of Realism in the Social Sciences, Routledge, 2012, p. 33. According to Michael Resnik, Gottlob Frege's work after 1891 can be interpreted as a contribution to realism.Michael Resnik, \"II. Frege as Idealist and then Realist,\" Inquiry 22 (1\u20134):350\u2013357 (1979). ===Contemporary philosophy=== In contemporary analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell,Bertrand Russell, Philosophy of Logical Atomism, Open Court, 1998 [1918].
