    "text": "The Hollies Greatest Hits is a compilation of singles by the Hollies, released on Epic Records in April 1973. It includes hit singles by the group on both the Epic and Imperial labels over a time span of 1965 to 1972. It spent seven weeks on the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 156. ==Content== The group's work was initially released on Imperial Records in the United States, then a subsidiary of Liberty Records, until the latter merged with United Artists Records and the Imperial imprint was discontinued. In 1967, the Hollies tsigned with Epic in the U.S., and this compilation appeared six years after the group's previous, featuring hits for Epic as well as several from the Imperial period. Since the group did not figure prominently on the American singles chart until late 1965, this compilation misses songs that had been big hits for the Hollies in the United Kingdom such as \"Stay,\" \"Here I Go Again,\" and \"I'm Alive.\" The album consists of every Top 40 hit enjoyed by the band in the United States with the exception of the number 40 hit \"Jennifer Eccles\" from 1968 and their cover of \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" from 1983. Nine of the tracks feature founding member Graham Nash during his tenure in the band through 1968. \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,\" \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress,\" and \"Long Dark Road\" were all released on Epic after his departure. The front cover consists of a collage referring to all twelve tracks. Greatest Hits was reissued on compact disc by Legacy Records on March 26, 2002. The remastered version added a bonus track, \"The Air That I Breathe\" from 1974, which was the Hollies' last top ten song in the U.S. ==Track listing== Chart positions taken from the Billboard Hot 100. ===Side one=== ===Side two=== ===2002 bonus track=== ==Personnel== * Allan Clarke \u2014 vocals, harmonica, guitar * Tony Hicks \u2014 lead guitar, banjo, vocals * Bobby Elliott \u2014 drums * Bernie Calvert \u2014 bass all tracks except \"Look Through Any Window\" and \"Just One Look\" * Graham Nash \u2014 vocals, rhythm guitar on \"Bus Stop,\" \"Carrie Anne,\" \"Stop Stop Stop,\" \"Look Through Any Window,\" \"Dear Eloise,\" \"Just One Look,\" \"King Midas in Reverse,\" \"Pay You Back with Interest,\" and \"On a Carousel\" * Terry Sylvester \u2014 rhythm guitar, vocals on \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress,\" \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,\" \"Long Dark Road,\" and \"The Air That I Breathe\" * Eric Haydock \u2014 bass on \"Look Through Any Window\" and \"Just One Look\" ==Production personnel== * Ron Richards \u2014 producer * Bob Irwin \u2014 compact disc producer * Vic Anesini \u2014 remastering engineer ==References== Category:1973 greatest hits albums Category:Albums produced by Ron Richards (producer) Category:The Hollies compilation albums Category:Epic Records compilation albums ",
