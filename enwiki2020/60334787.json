On November 17, 1916, the team scored 146 points against SMU. This remains the single-game scoring record for a Rice football team.Rice Football 2017 Football Fact Book, pp. 131, 133. Rice scored 23 touchdowns in the game, including six by left halfback Griffith Vance. The Houston Daily Post wrote that Vance's work was the \"outstanding feature of the game\", describing a \"wonderful side step\" and \"quick change of pace\" that enabled him to run through the entire SMU team several times for touchdowns. ==Schedule== ==References== Rice Category:Rice Owls football seasons Rice ",
