    "text": "The Catholic Church of Yerkalo also Yanjing Catholic Church () is a Christian temple located in Yerkalo (Tibetan: Tsakalo, Wylie: tsha kha lho, meaning \"salt pit\"), a village between 2650 and 3109 meters above sea level at the southern end of Markham County (Chamdo, Tibet Autonomous Region) in present- day China. == History == It was founded in 1865 by F\u00e9lix Biet and Auguste Desgodins, French missionaries of the Foreign Missions of Paris. The mission was based in Xinjiang but some of its missionaries opted to proselytize in Tibet. Within a few years, Tibetan marauders supported by Buddhist lamas killed 10 priests and destroyed all but one Catholic mission which was based in Yanjing. Bringing with them thirty-five of their faithful, having been expelled from the main mission of Bonga in Yerkalo, conquered by the Chinese empire, were legally established in some plots of land with the complicity of the population and silence of local leaders . Historically, China and Tibet disputed the possession of the Yerkalo saline wells, which passed from one side or the other of the Sino-Tibetan border. Finally, in 1932, the village was placed under the administration of the Lhasa government. According to the Xinhua news agency, the establishment of a small Catholic parish in Tibet was not an easy task. Frequent clashes took place between Catholics and nearby groups, culminating in the death of one of Father Biet's successors, Father Maurice Tornay in 1949. == Architecture == The exterior of the church features traditional Tibetan design while the interior has European Gothic designs. The church holds weekly services in the Tibetan language. As of 2014, the church had one priest, two sisters and services a estimated 559 worshippers around the area. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in China *History of European exploration in Tibet ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Tibet Category:Churches in Tibet ",
