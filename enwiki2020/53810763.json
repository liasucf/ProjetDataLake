    "text": "The Radeon RX 500 series is a series of graphics cards made by AMD. These cards are based on the fourth iteration of the Graphics Core Next architecture, featuring GPUs based on Polaris 30, Polaris 20, Polaris 11, and Polaris 12 chips. Thus the RX 500 series uses the same microarchitecture and instruction set as its predecessor, while making use of improvements in the manufacturing process to enable higher clock rates. Third-generation GCN chips are produced on a 28 nm CMOS process. Polaris (fourth-generation GCN) chips (except for Polaris 30) are produced on a 14 nm FinFET process, developed by Samsung Electronics and licensed to GlobalFoundries. Polaris 30 chips are produced on a 12 nm FinFET process, developed by Samsung and GlobalFoundries. ==Chipset table== XFX AMD Radeon RX 570 RS 8GB XXX Edition * Supported display standards are: DisplayPort 1.4 HBR, HDMI 2.0b, HDR10 color. * Dual-Link DVI-D and DVI-I at resolutions up to 4096\u00d72304 are also supported, despite ports not being present on the reference cards. === Desktop and laptop === == Radeon feature matrix == == See also == * Graphics Core Next * AMD Radeon Pro * AMD FireStream * List of AMD graphics processing units ==References== Category:Advanced Micro Devices graphics cards Category:Graphics processing units Category:Video cards ",
