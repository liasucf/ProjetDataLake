Man and woman wearing the himation A himation ( ) was a type of clothing, a mantle or wrap worn by ancient Greek men and women from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods (c. 750\u201330 BC). Sitting Achilles wrapped in a himation, depicted on a greek kylix from ca 500 BC. It was usually worn over a chiton and/or peplos, but was made of heavier drape and played the role of a cloak or shawl. When the himation was used alone (without a chiton), and served both as a chiton and as a cloak, it was called an achiton. The himation was markedly less voluminous than the Roman toga. It was usually a large rectangular piece of woollen cloth. Many vase paintings depict women wearing a himation as a veil covering their faces. The himation continued into the Byzantine era as \"iconographic dress\" used in art and by the lower classes, worn by Christ, the Virgin Mary, and biblical figures. ==See also== * Chiton (costume) * Clothing in the ancient world ** Clothing in ancient Greece * Exomis * Stephane (Ancient Greece) * Tunic * Zoster (costume) ==References== == External links == * Category:Byzantine clothing Category:Greek clothing Category:Robes and cloaks ",
