The expedition, partly scientific and partly searching for the missing John Ross, used Fort Reliance as a winter camp.Old Fort Reliance Back's fort was made up of a main house with several smaller ones that were constructed from logs. The houses had stone and clay chimneys for heating. The outline of the logs along with the chimneys and some storage pits still exist. In 1855, the Hudson's Bay Company's Chief Factor James Anderson, for whom the Anderson River is named, rebuilt the fort. It was intended to be used as winter quarters while searching for the lost expedition of John Franklin, but it was again abandoned after one season.James Anderson It was not a fur trading outpost although the site was later used by trappers in the Thelon River area. In 1897, a log cabin, using one of the chimneys, was built by an American trapper, Buffalo Jones.Buffalo Jones Fort Reliance was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1953. It is described by Parks Canada as the \"oldest continuously operating Hudson's Bay Company post, 1833\". Together with the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, Parks Canada is working to preserve and protect the site, which has resulted in the chimneys being rehabilitated.National Historic Sites of Canada System Plan ==Climate== ==References== ==External links== *Narrative of the Arctic land expedition to the mouth of the Great Fish River, and along the shores of the Arctic Ocean in the years 1833, 1834, and 1835, complete text of the book by George Back at the Internet Archive.
