    "text": "The Chief of the Carib Territory presides over the Carib Council, the local government of the Carib Territory (or Carib Reserve).Though under the Carib Reserve Act, the area's official name is the Carib Reserve, the Carib people themselves prefer the name Carib Territory, and that name is now in more popular use. See, e.g., (\"The reserve was renamed 'Carib Territory' by the Caribs themselves.\"); (\"...the Carib Territory, as it is now popularly called...\"). The position is the equivalent of a village council chairperson elsewhere in Dominica. (\"Except for this title, [the Carib Chief] plays the same role as all the other Village Council chairmen in Dominica.\") Beginning in the late 20th century, Carib Chiefs have also acted as a representative of the Carib Territory to other indigenous populations in the Caribbean region, and have worked with organizations including the Caribbean Organization of Indigenous Peoples and the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations.. Historically, the Chief was the leader of the Caribs or Kalinago, the indigenous inhabitants of Dominica. Under British colonialism, the title was officially recognized as a ceremonial position beginning in 1903, when the Carib Reserve was established. The colonial governor endowed the Carib Chief with a silver-headed staff and a sash embroidered with \"The Chief of the Caribs\" in gothic lettering.; . Colonial authorities suspended the position in 1930 after \"The Carib War,\" a brief, but violent, civil disturbance.See for a detailed account. The position of Chief was finally reinstated in 1953, as part of an island-wide system of local council government.; . {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Name !
