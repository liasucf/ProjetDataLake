It is the premier science high school of Quezon City, and is regarded as one of the prestigious sciences triumvirate of the Republic of the Philippines along with the Philippine Science High School and Manila Science High School. It is located at Bago-Bantay, Quezon City, Philippines. Founded in 1967, it was appointed as the Regional Science High School for the National Capital Region since 1998. It holds the distinction as one of the national leaders in the field of Mathematics competitions, being among the country's most consistent schools in terms of its performance in the DepEd-sponsored MTAP contests the past decades. In 2004, it shot to international acclaim when a group of its student-researchers received the fourth Grand Award in the Intel International Science and Engineering fair held in Portland, Oregon.http://sntpost.stii.dost.gov.ph/frames/julytosept04/pg19.htm The school continues to excel in producing quality research papers. It's the home of two of the best secondary papers in the Philippines. It's also renowned as a center of excellence for its Spanish elective. == History == B. Soriano, the Chief of Special Services, conceived the establishment of a science high school in Quezon City. This idea was announced by Alfredo J. Andal, the City Schools Superintendent in 1967. July 31, 1967, through a memorandum issued to all principals and head teachers, Mrs. Hermenegilda G. Margate, Mathematics and Science Supervisor, was designated by the City Superintendent of Schools to organize and take charge of the Quezon City Science High School. At first, the school shared a campus with Judge Juan Luna High School at San Francisco Del Monte; in 1969, the school moved to the present site of the Quezon City General Hospital, formerly the San Jose Seminary. In 1969, the Quezon City Council through the leadership of the then Vice Mayor Ismael A. Mathay, Jr. donated the present school site, measuring 2.4 hectares under Quezon City Government with TCT# 265553 in Barangay Sto. Cristo, Bago Bantay, Quezon City in 1969. In June 1999, Quezon City Science High School was declared as the Regional Science High School for the National Capital Region by virtue of DECS Order No. 58, series 1999 in consonance with R.A. 8496 (An Act to Establish the Philippine Science High School System and Providing Funds Therefore). = Admission = Applicants must have at least a grade of 85 in major subjects (Sciences, Math, English) and at least 83 in minor subjects to be able to take the entrance exam.

Placing and reigning over quiz bees abroad also happens a lot during every school year, especially in core science subject areas (Biology, Physics, Chemistry etc.). Students also succeed in the field of research. They gain awards locally and internationally throughout every year as they make it to competitions like I-SWEEEP, INESPO, INEPO, Intel-ISEF, and many others. The school papers also marks the school, being the champion of the whole country in the National Schools Press Conference (NSPC) in 2001. Awards are still being secured every year.

QueSci has a parking lot that snakes around the inside of the campus, 2 gates (Scientian/Golden Acres Road & Misamis St.), and 9 buildings. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Faculty !For Students/Function Rooms !Recreational/Sports/Clubs |- |Faculty Room |Library |Soccer Field |- |Science Center |COOP/Canteen |Covered Basketball Court |- |Math Center |Computer Labs 1 & 2 & 3 | |- |English Center |Chemistry Lab I & II |Volleyball Court |- |MAPEH Center |Physics Lab I & II |Badminton Court |- |Filipino Center |Biology Lab |Electron |- |AP Center |Speech Lab |Banyuhay |- |Principal's Office |Research Lab |GPTA Building |- |Registrar's Office |Reading Center |Bleachers |- |Guidance Councilor |Conference Hall |Island |- |Coop Storage Room |Mini Forest-Park |Gazebos |- |Coop Office |Botany Garden |Spanish Elective room |- |Guard House/Waiting Shed |Clinic | |- |ICT Faculty |Coop Extension | |- |Security Office |QueBalls | |} == Controversy == In 2009, during the sacking of publications supervised by adviser Rex San Diego, several students vented their angst in the Internet against principal Zenaida Sadsad. Several students created blogs targeting the school administration and its anomalous policies. These students criticised the partial policies being implemented in the school as well as the administration's oppression towards dissenting opinions. These blogs earned the students sanctions, which took toll when four students were suspended for more than a week. In 2013, a complaint affidavit was filed against Dr. Zenaida Sadsad. The affidavit includes the issues of: 1) accepting student applicants who did not actually meet the grade requirement of QCSHS. 2) openly endorsing Brainworks/Brainchamps Tutorial Learning Center to QCSHS student applicants, with the assurance of guaranteed admission slot in the school. The center boasts of 100% passing rate to the said science high school. 3) leaking out periodical test questions to said tutorial center. 4) threatening teachers who are spreading the issue of the test leakage with a libel suit and removal from service.http://www.rappler.com/nation/39952-quezon-city-science-high-school- corruption-principal Dr. Sadsad was temporarily moved to another school on the months of January to March 2010. She resumed office on April until her permanent transfer on September 30, 2013. = Notable alumni = * Dr. Calvin S. de los Reyes, Dangal ng Lipi Awardee for 2011 == Public Service and Government == * Hon.
