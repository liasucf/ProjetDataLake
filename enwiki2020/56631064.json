Its content, literary articles and reviews, and poetry and news from Wales, was aimed at the Welsh American population. The ability of Welsh migrants to America to maintain their language and culture are evident in this publication and others such as Y Drych and Yr Amserau. == See also == * Y Ford Gron - A Welsh language magazine of the same name, published in Wales between 1930 and 1935. == References == Category:Periodicals published in Wales Category:Welsh- language magazines Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
