Gieseker received his bachelor's degree in 1965 from Reed College and his master's degree from Harvard University in 1967. In 1970 he received his Ph.D. under Robin Hartshorne with thesis Contributions to the Theory of Positive Embeddings in Algebraic Geometry. Gieseker became a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1975. The topics of his research include geometric invariant theory and moduli of vector bundles over algebraic curves. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== *with Spencer Bloch: * * * * *with Jun Li: *with Jun Li: ===Books=== *Lectures on moduli of curves, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Springer Verlag 1982; notes by D.
