    "text": ", formerly known as , is an annual Manzai competition planned by Shinsuke Shimada and run by Yoshimoto Kogyo. The supporter Asahi Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts live throughout Japan via All-Nippon News Network. It is currently the most prevalent manzai competition in Japan. The grand prix ended in 2010 and was brought back in 2015 with sponsors including Cygames, Nissin Foods, FamilyMart, Suntory and Uniqlo. ==The way to be the Champion== Before 2010, to qualify as a contestant, the unit must have a career age of 10 years or under. When the competition was brought back in 2015, this limit was changed to 15 years or under. Other than this condition, anyone can enter the competition and reach the televised semifinals and finals if they pass through. Contestants must go through 5 rounds of elimination before moving to the televised finals, where only 8 units are selected from the semifinals to become finalists. The second chance round was introduced in the 2nd Grand Prix and allows for semi finalists to compete in an additional round competing for an addition spot as the second chance winners in the finals. From 2017 and onward, the total number of finalists increased to 9, plus an additional second chance winner. The finalists does a lottery draw to determine the entrance order, and are given points out of 100 by each of the judges. After all contestants have performed and points are given, the top 3 units with the highest points advanced to perform a second time at the grand finals. The judges then do a final vote to crown the winner. === Locations === *Preliminary (Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Quarterfinal, Semifinal) :from August or September until December :*Round 1 (2001): Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Hamamatsu, Nagoya, Osaka, Takamatsu, Hiroshima, Fukuoka :*Round 1 (2002): Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka :*Round 1 (2003-2009): Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Fukuoka :*Round 1 (2010): Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, Niigata, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Matsuyama, Fukuoka :*Round 2, Round 3, Semifinal (-2009), Quarterfinal (2010): Tokyo, Osaka :*Semifinal (2010): Tokyo (Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan) *Second Chance Consolation (2002-2010) :from noon until 5 p.m. on the day of the finals :aired on Sky A Sports Plus, a satellite broadcasting company owned by ABC (2004-2010) :The winner of the Second Chance Consolation gets a second chance as the final contestant at the M-1 finals :*2002-2004: special floor in front of Panasonic Center Tokyo :*2005: Meiji Jingu Stadium :*2006: Ariake Coliseum :*2007-2010: Ohi Racecourse *the Finals :live on TV (All-Nippon News Network, cast nation-wide) :*2001: Lemon Studio :*2002-2004: Panasonic Center Ariake Studio :*2005-2010: TV Asahi Headquarters Studio 1 == Winners == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ !Year !Winner !Final Votes !Unit Formed !Agency !Total # of Entrants |- |2001 |Nakagawake |6 |1992 |Yoshimoto Kogyo |1603 |- |2002 |Masuda Okada |5 |1993 |Shochiku Geino |1756 |- |2003 |Football Hour |4 |1999 |Yoshimoto Kogyo |1906 |- |2004 |Untouchable |6 |1994 |Production Jinrikisha |2617 |- |2005 |Black Mayonnaise |4 |1998 | rowspan=\"2\" |Yoshimoto Kogyo |3378 |- |2006 |Tutorial |7 |1998 |3922 |- |2007 |Sandwich Man |4 |1998 |Flatfive |4239 |- |2008 |Non Style |5 |2000 | rowspan=\"8\" |Yoshimoto Kogyo |4489 |- |2009 |Punk Boo Boo |7 |2001 |4629 |- |2010 |Warai Meshi |4 |2000 |4835 |- |2015 |Trendy Angel |6 |2004 |3472 |- |2016 |Ginshari |3 |2005 |3503 |- |2017 |Toro Salmon |4 |2002 |4094 |- |2018 |Shimofuri My\u014dj\u014d |4 |2013 |4640 |- |2019 |Milk Boy |6 |2007 |5040 |} *Under Final Votes, bold means it was a unanimous victory, all 7 judges voted for that unit as the winner. == Winner's prize == *Winner's prize \u00a510,000,000 *Winner's trophy *Additional prizes for 2015 :*Vacation to Palau courtesy of Cygames :*Champion jacket and commercial deal courtesy of Uniqlo :*10 years worth of Donbei cup noodles courtesy of Nissin Foods :*1000 pieces of Family Mart Premium fried chicken courtesy of FamilyMart *Additional prizes for 2016 :*Vacation to Hawaii courtesy of Cygames :*Commercial deal for M-1 no don courtesy of Nissin Foods :*100 kg of FamilyMart Premium fried chicken courtesy of FamilyMart :*1 year worth of The Premium Malts beer courtesy of Suntory *Additional prizes for 2017 :*Luxury vacation to Hawaii courtesy of Cygames :*T Point Card with points to redeem 1 year worth of Donbei cup noodles and FamilyMart Premium fried chicken courtesy of Nissin Foods and FamilyMart :*1 year worth of Strong Zero alcoholic beverage courtesy of Suntory *Additional prizes for 2018 :*Tickets for Serie A match with Juventus FC in Turin, Italy courtesy of Cygames :*100 kg of FamilyMart Premium fried chicken courtesy of FamilyMart :*1 year worth of Strong Zero alcoholic beverage courtesy of Suntory :*Chianina beef from Italy with 1 meal worth of Donbei cup noodles courtesy of Nissin Foods ==Historic Results== *The affiliated agency listed is the unit's agency at the time of the competition ===1st M-1 Grand Prix (2001)=== * The 7 judges are: Shinsuke Shimada, Hitoshi Matsumoto, Shoji Kokami, LaSalle Ishii, Koasa Shunp\u016btei, Yukio Aoshima, Kiyoshi Nishikawa * The 3 audience judges are from the cities of: Sapporo, Osaka, Fukuoka {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small;\" !Place!!
