In December 1950, the Czechoslovak People's Army established its own Central Music Service with the band making up a large part. A substantial change took place in the structure in 1953, when the band was divided and part of the musicians went to \u0160umperk in the Olomouc Region to create a regional regimental band with 19 members.
