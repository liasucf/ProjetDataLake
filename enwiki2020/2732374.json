    "text": "The Estadio Municipal de Bala\u00eddos (), known as Abanca-Bala\u00eddos for sponsorship reasons, is an all-seater stadium in Vigo, Spain. The stadium is the home of Celta Vigo, and accommodates a total of 29,000 spectators. ==History== ===Construction=== In September 1924, a group of local businessmen took the first steps towards the construction of the stadium by buying the 75,000 m2 on which the stadium would be built. The first job they faced was diverting the Lagares river. Two years later, the businessmen founded the Stadium de Bala\u00eddos, S.A. company, which would carry out the actual construction work on the new stadium. The architect of the stadium was Jenaro de la Fuente. ===Inauguration=== Bala\u00eddos was inaugurated on 30 December 1928. The stadium was blessed by the archpriest of Fragoso, Father Faustino Ande. The inaugural match was played between the hosts, Celta Vigo, and the Basque team Real Uni\u00f3n. The ceremonial kick-off was made by Carmen Gregorio-Espino, the daughter of former mayor Adolfo Gregorio Espino. Celta Vigo's Graciliano was the first player to score a goal in the new stadium, in a 7\u20130 win. ===Renovations=== Bala\u00eddos underwent its second large-scale renovation in preparation for the 1982 FIFA World Cup; The Rio stand was completely re- built, the Gol end was added to the stadium, and the Tribuna and Marcador stands were renovated. In the 2002\u201303 season, Celta qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history. Their celebrations were cut short when the stadium failed the subsequent UEFA stadium inspection required to host their fixtures. It was briefly mooted that Celta might have to play their home matches at Porto's Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. However, the necessary upgrades were paid for by the local authorities. ==Redevelopment projects== Due to the poor state of the stadium, the idea for a New Bala\u00eddos (, ) has been proposed several times in the past decade. ===2003=== In 2003, then club president of Celta Vigo Horacio G\u00f3mez presented an ambitious project for a new stadium and the surrounding area. The 95,000m2 redevelopment would include a shopping centre, a hotel and sports centre. It was approved by the financiers, Caixanova, but was rejected by the local authorities due to the strong opposition from Javier Riera, the director general of the nearby PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn factory, because of the increased disruption it would cause in the area. ===2015\u201317=== Starting from 2015, Bala\u00eddos has been undergoing major renovations. The stands have been entirely reconstructed to allow a much closer view for the spectators. Once renovations are completed, the capacity of the stadium will become 31,000 seats. Renovations are expected to be finalized in 2019. The stadium continues to host Celta's home matches during the renovation process. In February 2017, the roof of the stadium was damaged due to a storm, forcing a Liga match to be re-scheduled due to safety concerns. ==Structures and facilities== Bala\u00eddos is located on the Avenida Bala\u00eddos, in the district of Coia. It occupies the block bounded by Avenida Bala\u00eddos, R\u00faa Val Minor, Avenida Alcalde Portanet and R\u00faa dos Olimpicos Galegos. The stadium comprises four stands: Tribuna, R\u00edo (main stand), Gol (west end) and Marcador (east end), giving a total official capacity of 29,000. The record attendance at the stadium is 45,000 which was set in a Segunda Divisi\u00f3n match between Celta and Getafe in 1982. ===Tribuna=== The Tribuna stand runs parallel to Avenida Bala\u00eddos. It is a two-tiered stand \u2013 the upper-tier is Tribuna alta and lower-tier is Tribuna baixa. The club's bar, Celta Bar, is located in the Trinbuna stand. ===R\u00edo=== The R\u00edo stand is two-tiered and is the newest of the stands (built in 1981). The upper-tier is known as R\u00edo alto and lower-tier is R\u00edo baixo. The stand is named R\u00edo (River) as it was built over the original course of the Lagares river. ===Access=== The stadium is accessed through 25 gates, numbered 0-24, distributed across the four stands that make up the stadium; Gates 0-7 are located in the Tribuna stand, Gates 8-16 in the Marcador end, Gates 17-20 in the R\u00edo stand and Gates 20-24 in the Gol end. In 2012, as part of the renovations made to the exterior of the stadium the club decided to name each of these gates after a notable player.
