It's a law of perspective\") to try to overcome it. In 1965, Tune made his Broadway debut as a performer in the musical Baker Street.

In a letter to her daughter, Highsmith referred to Tune as her \"adopted boy\" whom she called \"Romano\". Tune later praised Highsmith for helping him develop his talents: \"She was an opening for me; she opened a little bit of my tight fabric so that I might peer through.\"Schenkar, Joan.
