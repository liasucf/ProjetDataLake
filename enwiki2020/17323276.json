    "text": ":This article is part of the history of rail transport by country series The history of rail transport in Finland began on January 31, 1862, with the opening of the railway line between Helsinki and H\u00e4meenlinna. By 1900 most of the future main lines had been constructed, including the line to St. Petersburg.4rail.net - Reference - Finland - Railway History 4rail.net By the time of the birth of the new Finnish Republic in 1917 lines connected all major cities, major ports, and reached as far as the Swedish border, and inner Finland as far north as Kontiom\u00e4ki in Paltamo region, as well as eastwards into Karelia. ==Rail in the Grand Duchy of Finland== In the 19th century Finland had an undeveloped primarily agricultural economy, the primary exports being forestry products, both timber and furs. Much of the transportation was conducted via waterways; Finland being a country of many lakes. However connecting the waterways system to the coast was problematic. The use of a railway had already been considered in the 1840s; In 1849 Claes Alfred StjernvallYlioppilasmatrikkeli 1640-1852 Claes Alfred Stjernvall www.helsinki.fi had suggested constructing a horse-drawn railway from Helsinki to Turkhauta\"MIKSI TIKKURILAN ASEMASTA TULI NIIN KOMEA? : HELSINGIN- H\u00c4MEENLINNAN RADAN ASEMIEN SYNTY osa I\", JORMA UIMONEN, Helsingin Pit\u00e4j\u00e4, 1994, 66-79 www.valt.helsinki.fi (in the municipality of Janakkala) ===H\u00e4meenlinna to Helsinki line (1862)=== At that time in its history Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire (see Grand Duchy of Finland) and subject to Russian influence, thus in 1849 Governor General Menshikov ordered the board of transportation (road and waterways) to investigate the construction of a railway connecting Helsinki and H\u00e4meenlinna.A concise history of Finland, D. G. Kirby, p109 Google books The investigations took two years and it was decided use locomotive traction, however construction was delayed due to the Crimean war. The project was restarted in 1856 by Tsar Alexander II's initiative.Rautatie H\u00e4meeseen 'Hameenlinna railway' kirjastohameelinna.fi Some opposed the very idea of the railways, in the Finnish senate responses to the proposed line reflected differing views in Finland at the time towards Finlands relationship with Russia: Finnish nationalists such as Johan Vilhelm Snellman favoured the line since it would aid development in Finland, more pro-Russian figures such as Lars Gabriel von Haartman favoured the idea of a line between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. After discussions it happened that the Helsinki to H\u00e4meenlinna line was the first to be built. The decision to build the line finalised in 1857, the line based on a revised version of the plan made in 1851. Knut Adolf Ludvig Stjernvall was construction manager, and came under criticism for the project cost, resigning in 1861.Stjernvall, Knut Adolf Ludvig www.kansallisbiografia.fi The line was opened in 1862. The track was 96 km long, singled tracked and expected to carry one train a day. For more frequent services passing loops could be used. After Helsinki intermediate stations were found at Pasila, Kerava, Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 and Riihim\u00e4ki before reaching H\u00e4meenlinna. Following the opening of the first railway line in Finland further lines were built, being constructed on the relative needs of industrial growth, populations, the interests of the Russian empire also being a guiding factor. The construction of early lines was primarily state controlled and financed. ===Riihim\u00e4ki \u2013 Saint Petersburg Railway (1868\u201370)=== A rail link between the capitals of the grand Duchy of Finland and of Russia had been considered for some time; surveys for a railway had been made in 1857, and some time after merchants of Vyborg had proposed to pay for the construction of a link between the Russian capital and Vyborg.\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f. 1870 - 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b. History: 1870-1918 www.terijoki.spb.ru No real progress was made until March 1867 when Finnish Senate proposed the construction of a link, in November 1867 the Tsar Alexander II gave a decree ordering its construction, stating that the link should be from Riihim\u00e4ki (a station on the Helsinki\u2013H\u00e4meenlinna line) to St. Petersburg, being favourable for transportation and trade as well as providing employment to many currently experiencing hardship due to the crop failure that caused the Finnish famine of 1866\u201368.

The main opening ceremony was held in February 1870 when the St. Petersburg\u2013Vyborg section was complete, at the famous Finlyandsky Rail Terminal; itself being built specifically for the new line. The whole line was open by September 1870. The entire railway including parts in Russia and the Russian rail terminal were the property and responsibility of the Finnish railways, not until 1913 and the building of a bridge over the Neva was the line connected to the railways of Russia proper. ===Hanko\u2013Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 railway (1872\u201375)=== A Baldwin 4-4-0 at Hanko railway station in 1893 The Hanko to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 railway was a private venture funded by which began construction in March 1872, and was opened in October 1873.Hangon rataa Otalammelle p10 OTASANOMAT No.2 2007 (magazine for Otalampi area of Finland), p10 \"glimpse of otalampi railway\" www.otalampi.net The line was expected to profit from enormous amounts of freight bound for the port of Hanko,Hanko-Hyvinkaa rata Hanko-Hyvinka line koti.mbnet.fiBeing the southernmost port in Finland it is free of ice for the longest period of the year, additionally it was expected that the line and port would serve imports and exports from russia and further east unfortunately three years earlier in 1870 the Paldiski\u2013Tallinn\u2013St. Petersburg line was completed in Estonia,Port of Paldiski :History www.portofpaldiski.com which competed. This first privately financed railway in Finland went bankrupt in 1875 and the Finnish government bought the railway for just over 10million marks. The line which was 153 km in length, also passed through Lohja and Karis on the way south to Hanko. ===Porvoo\u2013Kerava Railway (1874)=== The second private railway to be built in Finland was the 33 km long Porvoo to Kerava railway (Finnish: Porvoon Keravan Rautatie). The first proposals for a line were made in 1863 with local grandees and businessmen supporting the project on the understanding that it would stimulate trade, as well as the wish not to become a backwater compared to other ports that had a rail connection.Porvoo- Kerava-rautatie vuodesta 1874 Porvoo Kerava Railway (1874-) www.helsinkiww.net (information from article by Mikko Alameren in publication \"Resiina\" Issue 3/4 (1974) ) However the Finnish state gave priority to lines to Tampere and Lahti. Another attempt to gain funding was made in 1866, but this time the St. Petersburg line was given priorityThe state was unwilling to fund the project, and the St. Petersburg line was paid in part by an alcohol tax, and in part through a lone from Russian state funds. In 1871 the senate of the Grand Duchy of Finland granted permission for a line to be built.

By 1874 the railway was complete and carrying goods. The railway company soon experienced financial difficulties\u2014the amount of traffic had not lived up to estimates: by 1876 it was being offered for sale; by 1878 the original company was bankrupt; by 1887 a new owner was found; and in 1917 the company was sold to the Finnish state railways.Porvoon rata Porvoo railway, Author: Ismo Kirves www.helsinkiww.net (Passenger traffic ceased in 1981, freight around 1990, the line has since been used for heritage trains, and is used by the Porvoo museum railway.Porvoon Museorautatie r.y. / Borg\u00e5 Museij\u00e4rnv\u00e4g r.f. / The Porvoo Museum Railway Society www.helsinkiww.net) ===Tampere and Turku (1876)=== After connections from Helsinki to H\u00e4meenlinna and St. Petersburg had been made connections to Finland's great cities of Turku (Swedish \u00c5bo) and Tampere (Swedish Tammerfors) were next to get state approval.

Industrial line branches from mark to the north, coming off the northward part of the Savonia line to Harju maps.google.co.uk The Savonian line was completed in 1902 with the continuation of the track from Kuopio to Iisalmi (85 km); extensions to the Savonian line were opened in 1904 from Iisalmi with an 83 km track passing through Murtom\u00e4ki further north to Kajaani. and in 1923 when the line from Kajaani was extended 25 km to reach Kontiom\u00e4kiPieni Tietosanakirja, 4 volumes, 1925-1928, page 35 \"Savon rata\" \"The small encyclopedia\", finnish encyclopedia, web archive, via runeberg.org Thus by 1900 Kouvola railway station had become a major junction on the Finnish railway network with lines leading to St. Petersburg, Helsinki, Kotka, and to Savonia. ===Karelian railway (1892\u201395)=== Between 1892 and 1895 a series of lines known collectively as the Karelian railways (Finnish: Karjalan rataPieni Tietosanakirja, 4 volumes, 1925-1928, \"Karjalan rata\" Page 334 \"The small encyclopedia\", finnish encyclopedia, web archive, via runeberg.org) were built.Another line in Karelia, the Joensuu to Nurmes extension was added to the network in 1910-11 The first line completed was the 72 km Viipuri (or Vyborg) to Imatra line via Antrea (Kamennogorsk) in 1892. By 1893 an extension 139 km long from Antrea through Hiitola, Elisenvaara, Jaakkima, and Sortavala was complete. The final part of the line was from Sortavala though Matkaselk\u00e4, V\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, Onkamo and Sulkuniemi to Joensuu was complete in 1894 adding another 133 km.

In September he returned to Russia again in another disguise; this time he was more successful: As a consequence of the Russian revolution Finland was able to gain its independence in peace from Russia, and on 6 December 1917 Finland's Declaration of Independence was made. During the Finnish Civil War the rail network was sufficiently well developed to play a significant role in the conflict;Armoured Trains and Railways of Finnish Civil War www.jaegerplatoon.net a train from Russia, the so-called \"weapons train\" arrived in January 1918 bringing 15,000 rifles, 30 machine guns, 76mm guns, two armoured cars and ammunition.

A line northwards from Tornio to Karunki opened in 1923; close to the Swedish border, and extending to Kaulinranta by 1928The track was extended in the 1960s to Kolari. In finnish it is known as the Kolarin rata In 1924 a line from Matkaselk\u00e4 (on the Vyborg\u2013Joensuu) line to Suoj\u00e4rvi opened, by 1927 it had been extended to Naistenj\u00e4rvi. Various other lines expanded the network through the 1920s and 1930s including an east\u2013west connection of 154 km between Iisalmi and Ylivieska; this connected the Ostrobothnian line on the west coast with the Savonia line in the east of the country. Another important east\u2013west connection was made in 1930 with Oulu and Kontiom\u00e4ki being joined by a 166 km railway. Outokumpu was connected in 1928 from Joensuu, and Vuokatti to Nurmes in 1929. A line in Lapland eastward from Rovaniemi to Kemij\u00e4rvi was built in 1934, this was extended further east to Salla in 1942, and Pori connected to Haapam\u00e4ki by a 193 km line in 1938. The 1930s as in other countries were considered the heyday of rail transportVR respects the past in its operations www.vrgroup.fi ===Second World War=== During the Winter War the Finnish forces again used armoured trains. Two trains were fielded, both dating to the World War I era.Finnish Artillery Arm in the Winter War: The armoured trains www.winterwar.com The Armoured Train No.1 (Finnish: Ps.Juna 1 : abbr. from Panssarijuna) was used mostly to support the fighting in the Kollaa River area, found to be effective in supporting infantry. The opposing Soviet forces recognised this and it was repeatedly targeted by artillery and attacked from the air; as a result hiding places had to be found for the armoured train, and modifications made\u2014such as smokestack extension pipes that directed the exhaust smoke under the train, to reduce the risk of it being spotted.
