The group is part of the Southern High Rh\u00f6n, which is in turn part of the High Rh\u00f6n, a mountain region within the East Hesse Highlands. The natural region is drained by the Sinn in the west, the Brend in the east and the Schmalwasserbach and Kellersbach in the south. The mountains form part of the Central Upland range known as the Rh\u00f6n Mountains.Brigitte Schwenzer:: Geographische Landesaufnahme: The natural regional units on Sheet 140 Schweinfurt.
