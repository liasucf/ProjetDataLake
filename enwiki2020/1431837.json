    "text": "Meadow Lake is a city in the boreal forest of northwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. Its location is about northeast of Lloydminster and north of North Battleford. Founded as a trading post in 1799, it became a village in 1931 and a town in 1936. On November 9, 2009, it officially became Saskatchewan's 14th city. Meadow Lake is the main business centre of northwestern Saskatchewan and serves the many towns and villages as a regional shopping centre. It is the second-largest community in Saskatchewan's Census Division No. 17, after Saskatchewan's portion of the interprovincial city of Lloydminster. The city borders the Rural Municipality of Meadow Lake No. 588 and the Flying Dust First Nation No. 105 reserves. ==History== Peter Fidler built Bolsover House in 1799 near \"Lac des Prairies\", the first name given to Meadow Lake. In 1873 Metis families arrived establishing a Hudson's Bay Company trading post, joined by other settlers in the early 1900s. The largest impetus occurred following a fire of 1919 and the exodus of some of the settlers during the Great Depression from the Dust Bowl of central and southern Saskatchewan to communities in the north. ===Bolsover House=== For fur trade in the area see Beaver River (Canada). Peter Fidler of the Hudson's Bay Company was told by Indian guides that Meadow Lake was a good place for furs. On August 30, 1799 he reached the mouth of the Meadow Lake River. The stream was so narrow and crooked that he almost despaired of navigating it. When he reached the Lake he found it so shallow and swampy that he had to proceed demi-charg\u00e9. Finding no good place on the lake he went up a river and selected a place about 1000 yards inland. He named it Bolsover House after his home town in England. The post returned only 190 made beaver in the first season so in 1801 it was closed and everything moved east to Green Lake House. The exact site of Bolsover House is unknown. There is a monument to Peter Fidler in Meadow Lake.Elizabeth Browne Losey,\"Let Them be Remembered:The Story of the Fur Trade Forts\",1999 ==Demographics== The Meadow Lake Indian Band was established in 1889 with signing of Treaty 6 to the north of Meadow Lake. This reserve is now named the Flying Dust First Nation. The 1955 population was established as 1,978 by the Saskatchewan Business Directory and as 2,453 in the 1955 Golden Jubilee edition of Saskatchewan Business Directory. 2,216 given in the table is the average of these two population counts. On November 9, 2009, it officially became Saskatchewan's 14th city. The population is a matter of uncertainty. The 2001 census showed only a population of 4,582 persons living on 7.64 km2 (2.95 sq mi) of land - Saskatchewan generally requires a sustained population over 5,000 to qualify for city status - however, the city's Community Profile indicates that an unofficial re-count by Statistics Canada in 2004 showed a population of 5,021.city's Community Profile available as a Word document on the city's website However, the 2006 census figure shows 4,771, while population figures cited in the Community Report and based upon information from Saskatchewan Health claim a 2005 population of 6648. By comparison, Melville, Saskatchewan still retains its city charter despite a population drop to between 4,200 and 4,300. ==Geography== Meadow Lake is located in the middle of an area pre-historically covered by a large glacial lake also called Meadow Lake (Saskatchewan) formed from a receding continental glacier, of which only a fraction still exists. The lake is located on the east side of the city. The ancient lakeshore forms the Meadow Lake Escarpment, a significant terrain feature clearly visible looking south from many points in the city. The area is a part of the Southern Boreal EcoRegion with the Northern Boreal EcoRegion to the north and the Parkland EcoRegion on the south. The neighbouring rural areas include Trembling aspen Populus tremuloides, White spruce Picea glauca, Jack Pine Pinus banksiana, Black Spruce Picea mariana and muskegs Specifically Meadow Lake is situated in the Meadow Lake plain of the Boreal transition ecoregion in the Boreal Plain ecozone. ===Climate=== Meadow Lake experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc) that falls just short of being classified as a Humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb).

Meadow Lake acts as a business hub in its local area, providing services for the smaller surrounding communities of Dorintosh and Rapid View and surrounding reserves including the Flying Dust First Nation and the Eagles Lake reserve.

The Flying Dust First Nation, which directly borders the town, owns and operates many of the city's most profitable industries, including direct ownership of NorSask Forest Products Inc., a portion of the Meadow Lake OSB Partnership, stakes in local trucking and service companies, and a sizeable farming operation which is currently limited to leasing the vast amounts of local property they own or have title on.
