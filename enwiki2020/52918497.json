    "text": "Not Safe After Dark (1998) is the first collection of short stories by Peter Robinson; stories previously published in crime anthologies and magazines. They include three Inspector Banks short stories, one (Going Back) previously unpublished. The 1998 edition published by Crippen & Landru, Virginia as Not Safe After Dark and Other Stories included thirteen stories (according to the author\u2019s website); the 2004 edition published by Macmillan, London as Not Safe After Dark and Other Works included twenty stories. Robinson is the writer of the Inspector Banks series of novels. ==Contents== The stories are set in Yorkshire, London, Canada (often Toronto), the United States, Paris and Vienna. Several involve miscarriages of justice: either an innocent person convicted or no-one convicted. Two stories in Not Safe After Dark: Missing in Action and In Flanders Fields are set in wartime (1940s) Yorkshire with Frank Bascombe a \"special constable in the war\" and veteran of World War I. They were written after researching the period for In a Dry Season. The story Cornelius Jubb in The Price of Love was intended as the third and refers to \"Constable Bascombe\", although he could not use the full name Frank Bascombe in that collection for copyright reasons; see Introduction and Afternotes to the collections. Those from anthologies often involve a theme specified by the editor or a source, which are given below if stated by Robinson in the Introduction to the collection.

At 106 pages in manuscript (87 pages in the collection; from the 2004 introduction to the collection) it was too long for magazines or anthologies, so it gathered dust\" until he included parts about the young Banks and family into The Summer that Never Was. When revised for this collection he shifted it chronologically to fall between The Summer that Never Was and Playing with Fire and tried to avoid too much repetition of details cannibalized for the novel. ==External links== * Dedicated page on author's website Category:1998 short story collections Category:2004 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Peter Robinson (novelist) ",
