As a student at the University of Hawaii he was elected president of the university YMCA. He graduated in 1941 and went on to earn a degree in theology from the Union Theological Seminary in 1944. == Career == After he graduated, Katagiri worked with labor union leaders to unite white, black, and Japanese American workers at Seabrook Farms, where Japanese Americans who were released from internment camps worked while they were transitioning back into society. After that, Katagiri taught at Doshisha University. In 1959 he moved to Seattle and was the campus minister at the University of Washington. In 1969 he started the Asian Coalition for Equality.

He was head of the church's Northern California Conference from 1975 to 1984. During that time he worked with Angel Taglucop and Erasto Arenas to establish ministries in San Francisco's Filipino community.
