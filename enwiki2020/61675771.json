The song was written by Cabello, Alexandra Tamposi, Andrew Wotman, Jonathan Bellion, Jordan Johnson and Stefan Johnson. Songwriting credits were also given to Lionel Richie and Ace of Base members Jenny Berggren, Jonas Berggren, Malin Berggren and Ulf Ekberg due to interpolations of \"All Night Long (All Night)\" and \"All That She Wants\". It was produced by Watt, The Monsters and the Strangerz and Bellion. The song achieved moderate success internationally.

The first installment was announced to premiere on September 5, 2019. Cabello uploaded several pictures of the cover art being revealed and presented in a museum- type of room in the days after. The official cover art of the song was unveiled September 4, 2019. ==Composition== \"Liar\" contains elements of flamenco and Latin trap, and a ska-pop chorus. It was written by Camila Cabello, Alexandra Tamposi, Andrew Wotman, Jonathan Bellion, Jordan Johnson, Stefan Johnson, Jenny Berggren, Jonas Berggren, Malin Berggren, Ulf Ekberg and Lionel Richie, and produced by Wotman, The Monsters and the Strangerz and Bellion. \"Liar\" runs for three minutes and twenty-seven seconds. In terms of music notation, \"Liar\" was composed using common time in the key of B minor. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Cabello's vocal range spans from the low note F#3 to the high note of F#5, giving the song a two octave vocal range. ==Critical reception== Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote in his review, \"'Liar' is a canny pan- Caribbean and Spanish m\u00e9lange. As she sings about how a certain kiss makes her lose control despite herself \u2014 'Clothes are on the floor,' she notes at the end \u2014 the ultra-canny track segues from mariachi horns to the stark electronics of Latin trap to flamenco handclaps to a ska-pop chorus: border- hopping at the speed of pop.\" == Live performances == Cabello performed the song live at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Festival, and at a private fan concert hosted by Verizon. She also performed the song on The Graham Norton Show on October 25, 2019. ==Music video== ===Background=== Cabello shared a 26-second preview of the music video on September 11, 2019, through social media and stated \"literally most fun video I've ever made.\" It was directed by Dave Meyers and released on September 12, 2019. As of August 2020, it has over 100 million views and 2 million likes on YouTube becomes Cabello's 16th videos to achieve this milestone. \"Liar\" is a mini movie, and features a fictional romantic love triangle, with Cabello playing herself and La Flaca (English: the skinny girl), which is the hostess of Tea Time with La Flaca, Gordita y Tammy, a fictional television show, while Zak Steiner plays Reese Kensington, and Keiynan Lonsdale plays \"the busboy.\" It also stars Nataliz Jimenez as Gordita and Chelsea Brea as Tammy. ===Synopsis=== Camila Cabello is seen being confronted by her fianc\u00e9, while being strapped onto a polygraph. The video begins with Camila Cabello at an outdoor restaurant with her suave-talking fianc\u00e9 (portrayed by Zak Steiner), who only sees her as his trophy wife. She starts to show feelings towards a restaurant waiter (portrayed by Keiynan Lonsdale), who accidentally spills red wine that leaves a heart-shaped stain. However, Cabello begins to be placed in a Groundhog Day-style time loop where she wakes up and repeats the same date scenario with her fianc\u00e9 after dying in various accidents which become more surreal. These include choking to death, getting crushed by a falling elephant, run over by a horde of bicyclists, being swarmed by drones, and inadvertently burning down her fianc\u00e9's mansion. She is then taken away by the Truth Police to be placed on a polygraph, while wearing a straitjacket. Cabello finally professes her love to the waiter, as she wakes up the next day in a different house and holds a digitally animated bird, seemingly breaking out of the time loop. In the closing moments of the video, a TV in the room plays a sensationalist TV show previously played near the start of the video. The three fictionalized hosts (Cabello portrays the lead host wearing a red wig) start conversing about her recent break-up and mock her dating choices, as Cabello reaches for the remote and turns the TV off. ===Reception=== Althea Legaspi, who writes for Rolling Stone, stated that, \"Mirroring the song's lyrics about falling for someone, despite being in continual denial about those feelings, the visual sees Cabello reliving a number of scenes that get progressively more ridiculous and humorous as she tries to escape her conflicting emotions.\" Patrick Hosken of MTV News penned, \"'Liar,' is cinematic in scope \u2014 the pink shot of Cabello amid a sea of flamingos is downright dazzling \u2014 and also features Cabello playing a gossipy TV host. As the slapstick drama heightens, Cabello has a lot of fun playing someone increasingly more unhinged.\" ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. Note: Click \u24d8 to view credits.
