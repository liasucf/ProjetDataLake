It is a subsidiary of Exelon. The company provides electric power, natural gas, and energy management services. It has approximately two million customers across the continental United States. The company was known as Constellation Energy Group (former NYSE ticker symbol CEG), until a merger with Exelon in 2012. When the acquisition was approved by FERC, Constellation Energy's energy supply business was re-branded as Constellation, an Exelon company. As part of the 2012 merger, Baltimore Gas and Electric, the regulated utility operated by Constellation Energy, became a regulated utility operating under Exelon Utilities. Before merging with Exelon, Constellation Energy Group operated more than 35 power plants in 11 states (mainly Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and California). Baltimore Gas and Electric created Constellation as a holding company in 1999. Constellation Energy was a Fortune 500 company and one of the largest electricity producers in the United States. ==History== On September 15, 2005, Constellation Energy announced a joint venture, UniStar Nuclear, with Areva to market the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) in the United States.
