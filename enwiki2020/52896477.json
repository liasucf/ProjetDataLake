The park is in the Brazilian Highlands, near the Uruguay River in the valley of the Marmeleiro stream. ==History== The Espig\u00e3o Alto Forest Reserve was created by state decree 658 of 10 March 1949. It was transformed into a state park by law 2.440 of 2 October 1954.

The most conspicuous trees are the araucarias, which once covered 25% of the state but have been reduced to 1%. One of the araucarias is over tall and is estimated from the width of its trunk to be more than 300 years old.
