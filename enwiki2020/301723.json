Although the company's name changed, the bald eagle remained the company's emblem. During the late 19th century, breweries were also opened in Saratoga Springs, New York City, and Trail, British Columbia, although they were eventually merged with the Pottsville plant. Frank D. Yuengling began heading the company in 1899 after his father Frederick died. During the Prohibition era, Yuengling survived by producing \"near beers\" (beverages with a 0.5% alcohol content) called \"Yuengling Special\", \"Yuengling Por-Tor\", and \"Yuengling Juvo\". The company also ran a dairy which produced ice cream and opened dance halls in Philadelphia and New York City. In 1933 when the nation's breweries and disgruntled beer lovers finally won the fight against Prohibition, Yuengling introduced its symbolic Winner Beer, celebrating Prohibition's repeal, and the brewery shipped a truck load of its popular brew to the White House to show their appreciation to President Roosevelt.

The Pottsville brewery was featured on an episode of The History Channel's American Eats. In 1987, the brewery reintroduced an amber lager they had not made in decades to take advantage of a spike in popularity of heavier- style beers. Since this time, Yuengling Lager has become its flagship brand, accounting for 80% of production and much of its rapid growth. In 1990, the brewery sold 138,000 barrels. At the time, Yuengling was the largest brewer of porter in the United States. In the early 1990s, demand throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware outstripped the existing brewery's abilities.

Introduced in 1987,\"Lager, a Popular Newcomer\", Pottsville Republican and Herald, Aug. 16-17, 1997 it was developed by longtime Yuengling brewmaster N. Ray Norbert.Andrusavage, Frank, \"Pottsville - Yuengling Brewery is a Claim to Fame\", Standard Speaker (Hazelton, PA) Apr. 28, 1997, p. 19 It subsequently became the company's flagship beer, and what is received if a \"lager\" is ordered throughout many parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. It is usually sold in green bottles prominently featuring the word \"LAGER\" on the label, but is also available in cans, brown quart bottles, and 24 ounce cans. It was previously offered in 22 ounce bottles, colloquially known as \"bombers\". The \"bomber\" name is still used for the large cans. Yuengling Lager is 4.4 percent ABV. * Light Lager : A lower-calorie version of the Traditional Lager. * Yuengling Premium Beer This was Yuengling's flagship brand prior to the introduction of Traditional Lager.Robertson, James D. The Great American Beer Book (Warner Books 1978). As of 2020 its distribution is primarily limited to Pennsylvania. : A standard American pilsner. * Yuengling Premium Light Beer : A lower-calorie version of the Premium Beer. * Original Black & Tan : This black and tan is a mixture of Yuengling Premium Beer (40%) and Dark-Brewed Porter (60%). It was introduced in 1986. * Dark-Brewed Porter : A Baltic porter with a very dark cola color, appearing almost black in the glass with a pale tan head, and a strong malt flavor. Porter originated in England in the early 1700s and became popular in Colonial America, with production concentrated in Pennsylvania. When German brewers like D.G. Yuengling began brewing in America, the popularity of porter led them to add porters to their offerings. Prior to the start of the craft brewing revolution in the 1970s, Yuengling, Stegmaier and Narragansett were the only breweries still producing porters on a regular basis in the United States.\"American Porters\", by Martin Lodahl, https://www.morebeer.com/articles/american_porters (By this time, no British breweries were brewing porters.) For this reason, these breweries have been credited with helping to keep the porter style alive. Rather than using the traditional top-fermenting ale yeasts used in most porters, Yuengling's porter is bottom-fermented; few mainstream breweries produce this style. Since the 1800s it has been known as \"Pottsville Porter\". * Lord Chesterfield Ale : Named for Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, this is Yuengling's hoppiest beer. Although Yuengling brewed ales in the 1800s,Pottsville Republican, Feb. 14, 1885, p. 7 Lord Chesterfield Ale was introduced in 1934 and was described then as a Canadian type ale.Pottsville Evening Republican, Dec. 29, 1934, p. 6 This is not a true ale as it is brewed with, \"bottom- fermenting\" type, lager yeast. Like the Traditional Lager, it is usually sold in green bottles (but also in cans) and has an element of corn in its profile. It is very carbonated and tends to sprout a large but short-lived head when poured. As of 2007, Lord Chesterfield is no longer sold in kegs. However, quarter kegs were put back on the market in October 2008. *Golden Pilsner :Introduced in 2018, Golden Pilsner is the first year-round beer introduced in 17 years. Combining pale and specialty malts, and Hallertau and Saaz hops, it has an ABV of 4.7% and comes in at 135 calories. It was initially distributed April 1 to select markets, but eventually made its way around the 22-state footprint Yuengling covers. * Yuengling Oktoberfest :Produced for the Oktoberfest season, beginning in 2011. It is currently Yuengling's only seasonal beer. *FLIGHT by Yuengling :Introduced in 2020, FLIGHT by Yuengling is what the brewery has deemed the \"next generation of light beer.\" With 2.6 grams of carbs, 95 calories, and 4.2% ABV, the beer is brewed to be crisp and easy-to-drink. Beginning in March 2020, it will be available in bottles (and selectively on tap) across Yuengling's 22-state footprint. ===No longer produced=== * Yuengling BockYuengling Bock Beer to Return in 2010 (D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc.) : Introduced in February 2009, this was a return of a discontinued beer last brewed in the 1970s. According to company sources, it was to be sold as a draught-only, spring seasonal beer. Due to its popularity Yuengling Bock beer was made available for kegs and cases in January 2010. Bock Beer was discontinued in early 2015 after not meeting sales expectations. * Summer Wheat :Yuengling introduced a Summer Wheat beer in 2014. It was 4.5% ABV and was less hoppy than the normal brew. It was described as \"a southern true authentic Bavarian-style wheat beer. Summer Wheat was discontinued in 2017 along with Yuengling IPL when the Golden Pilsner was introduced, as \"part of a business strategy to focus more on the core brands.\" *Yuengling IPL :At 5% ABV, the India Pale Lager was bright in color and loaded with Bravo, Belma, Cascade, and Citra hops on a balanced lager base. The IPL was first brewed in 2015 and discontinued along with Summer Wheat in 2017. * Old German : It was descibed in 1978 as darker in color than Yuengling premium, deep yellow gold, with the aroma of burnt baked potato, a sharp hop taste and bitter finish. It was less expensive than Yuengling Premium. * Half & Half : Originated from Reading's Northeast Taproom where they mixed a 50/50 blend of Dark-Brewed Porter and Lord Chesterfield Ale. The local bar then requested that Yuengling sell the draft pre-mixed and the official \"Half & Half\" was born. It was replaced by Original Black & Tan in 1986 and was discontinued. == References == == External links == * * Historical video profile about the brewery, family history and brewing traditions.
