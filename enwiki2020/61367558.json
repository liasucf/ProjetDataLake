Founder of Sikh religion Guru Nanak came to Baghdad in early sixteenth century in fact in around 1511 AD, ,during his travels to world communities. He also visited the holy places of Muslims like Mecca and Madina. ==Historical significances== Guru Nanak exchanged ideas on religion with religious authorities like Pirs. This led to formation of a group of his followers in Baghdad who remembered the Guru as Baba Nanak. There was very loose contact between this place and Sikhs of Punjab until First World War when some Sikh soldiers rediscovered it. Kirpal Singh a captain in Indian Medical Service of World War I time, located this gurdwara in west of town Baghdad between old graveyard to the north and present Baghdad Samara railway line to the south. To the Arabs this place is well known as tomb of Bahlol. Historic relics such as an old plaque with text inscribed in Arabic, existed in the Shrine till Iraq war in 2003, were looted by some miscreants after the war. Iraqi Goveronment in 2007 expressed a desire to rebuild the shrine in 2007. According to a news report Abu Yusuf was caretaker of the shrine in 2011. Prior to war a few Sikh pilgrims used to visit the shrine, rather reports of some regular interval congregations by Indian workers in Iraq and cooking and sharing a meal by them on the place are also there. ==Present status== In 2014 ISIS captured Mehsul area in Iraq. Some Indian workers were captured and killed during the area under their control. Position in 2018 is that Gurdwara has been completely damaged. Only parts of outer wall could be seen next to tomb of Bahlol. Only one Mehrab remained in one of the walls. Since 2018, a gate protects the space of former gurdwara. ==References== ==External links== Category:Religion in Iraq Iraq https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1705842122801278&id;=100001265209345 ",
