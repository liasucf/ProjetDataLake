    "text": "Machine Gun Etiquette is the third studio album by English punk rock band the Damned. It was released on 2 November 1979 by Chiswick Records. == Background == The album was the group's first since reforming with a new lineup of Dave Vanian on vocals, Captain Sensible on lead guitar, Rat Scabies on drums and Algy Ward on bass guitar. On Machine Gun Etiquette, the band brought more variety to their usual punk rock to add wide-ranging pop rock. The voice at the album's start is Jack Howarth, taken from his 1971 album 'Ow Do, a recording of Lancastrian monologues. The mispronounced album name would later be used in fusion with Thee Headcoats name as the Japanese band name Thee Michelle Gun Elephant by their former bassist. == Reception == AllMusic's retrospective review reported that when it was released, Machine Gun Etiquette was \"deservedly hailed as another classic from the band\". The website praised the variety of styles explored and the group's typically strong wit. Scott Rowley of Classic Rock magazine, reviewing the 25th Anniversary Edition of the album, defined it as \"a riotous, ballsy rush of an album [...] the sound of a band coming into its own\", adding that \"while the Clash looked to America for inspiration, the Damned remained resolutely British\", perhaps ironically given that the front cover depicted the band in a New York street scene at 704 7th Avenue, New York City. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from the 25th Anniversary Edition liner notes. ; The Damned * Dave Vanian \u2013 lead vocals * Captain Sensible \u2013 guitars, backing vocals, keyboards, bass (\"I Just Can't Be Happy Today\", \"Smash It Up (Parts 1 & 2)\"), bass solo (\"Anti- Pope\"), Mandolin (Turkey Song), lead vocals on \"Turkey Song\" * Rat Scabies \u2013 drums, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Burglar\" * Algy Ward \u2013 bass, backing vocals, guitar (\"Machine Gun Etiquette\", \"Liar\") ; Additional personnel: * Joe Strummer \u2013 backing vocals (\"Noise, Noise, Noise\"), hand claps (\"Machine Gun Etiquette\") * Topper Headon \u2013 backing vocals (\"Noise, Noise, Noise\") * Henry Badowski \u2013 backing vocals (\"Noise, Noise, Noise\") * Paul Simonon \u2013 hand claps (\"Machine Gun Etiquette\") * Lemmy Kilmister \u2013 bass, backing vocals (\"Ballroom Blitz\") ; Production * The Damned \u2013 producer * Roger Armstrong \u2013 producer * Ed Hollis \u2013 producer (\"Love Song (Ed Hollis Version)\", \"Noise, Noise, Noise (Ed Hollis Version)\", \"Suicide\") * Alvin Clarke \u2013 engineer (Sound Suite) * Mike Shipley \u2013 engineer (Wessex) * Gary Edwards \u2013 engineer (Wessex) * Jeremy Green \u2013 engineer (Wessex) * Rik Watton \u2013 engineer (Workhouse) * Damian Korner \u2013 engineer (Utopia) * G.
