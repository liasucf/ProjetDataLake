    "text": "thumb Opened CD-57 The (Hagelin) CD-57 was a portable, mechanical cipher machine manufactured by Crypto AG, first produced in 1957.one website gives the production dates as \"1956 and 1957\" , another website says \"first produced in 1957\" . It was derived from the earlier CD-55, and was designed to be compatible with the larger C-52 machines. Compact, the CD-57 measured merely 5 1/8in \u00d7 3 1/8in \u00d7 1 1/2in (13 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 3.8 cm) and weighed 1.5 pounds (680 gr). The CD-57 used six wheels. A variant is the CD-57(RT), a similar device using a one-time pad system rather than rotating wheels. The STG-61 was a licensed copy of the CD-57 by Hell. Sullivan (2002) shows how the CD-57 can be attacked using a hill climbing search technique. ==See also== * M-209 ==Notes== ==References== * Wayne G.
