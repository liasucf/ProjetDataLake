Lady Blanche Arundell, Mistress Barbara Sidney (daughter of the Viscountess Lisle), Mistress Southwell of the queen's privy chamber (later Lady Dudley), and Gargrave joined her. A gentleman usher then took Br\u00fblart to the queen in the Privy Chamber.John Finet, Finetti Philoxenis (London, 1656), p. 40.
