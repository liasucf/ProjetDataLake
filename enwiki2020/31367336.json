As with previous European championships the 1979 W.A.K.O. championships were open to amateur men based in Europe only, with each country allowed more than one competitor in an individual weight category. Two styles of kickboxing were on offer \u2013 Full-Contact and Semi-Contact. By the championships end West Germany was yet again the strongest nation, with Yugoslavia in second place, and hosts Italy in third - more detail on the winners and medal tables can be found in the sections below. The event was held in 1979 in Milan, Italy. ==Men's Full-Contact Kickboxing== At Milan the men's Full-Contact kickboxing category had seven weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, with all bouts fought under Full- Contact rules. More detail on Full-Contact's rules-set can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules have changed since 1979. The medal winners of each division are shown below with Peter Harbrecht winning yet another gold and future K-1 world champion Branko Cikati\u0107 winning his first major title. Also of interest were Jerome and Jonny Canabate who had won medals at previous W.A.K.O. championships representing Switzerland, but were now picking up medals for the host nation Italy. At the end of the championships West Germany were the strongest nation in the Full-Contact category winning four gold, one silver and one bronze medal. ===Men's Full- Contact Kickboxing Medals Table=== {| |- | -57 kg |Jerome Canabate |Boffa |Jonny Canabate |- | -63 kg |Klaus Friedhaber |Jimmie Barletta |Jorg Leuk- Emden |- | -69 kg |Ferdinand Mack |Kemal Zeriat |Colapietro |- | -74 kg |Peter Harbrecht |Erling Havn\u00e5 |A.

As with Full-Contact there were seven weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs.
