The Mallappally convention and the Shivarathri festival take place on two such large sandy patches near the Manimala Bridge across the river. Vishu mahotsavam, held in the Pariyaram Sree-Krishna swami temple, is another old event. People from various parts of the Mallappally and Tiruvalla taluks come for the fest. ==References== Category:Geography of Pathanamthitta district ",
