Only one prototype was completed; the project was abandoned in favour of a jet aircraft. ==Design and development== The I.Ae. 30 \"\u00d1anc\u00fa\", named after an indigenous eagle of Patagonia, was designed by Italian engineer Cesare Pallavicino, who had come to Argentina in 1946. Pallavicino led a team of Argentine technicians and engineers in developing the concept of a high-speed escort fighter, intended to be operated in conjunction with the Avro Lincoln bombers used in the Argentine Air Force. The I.Ae. 30 had a metal structure, its powerplants consisted of two Rolls-Royce Merlin 604 engines, each developing 1,800 hp at 3,000 RPM, and four-bladed propellers. The armament would consist of six 20 mm Oerlikon automatic cannons mounted in the nose, although later plans called for 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannons as well as a 250 kg bomb under the fuselage and two batteries of five 83 mm rockets fitted underneath the wings. Nevertheless, the prototypes were unarmed. By the end of 1947, a contract was received for the first of three projected prototypes. On 9 June 1948 the first prototype was ready for ground tests and on 17 July 1948, the I.Ae. 30 took to the air for the first time, piloted by Captain Edmundo Osvaldo Weiss. ==Operational history== I.Ae.30 \u00d1anc\u00fa during testing, c. 1948 The test results proved that the aircraft possessed good flying characteristics as well as meeting performance specifications. During a cross country flight, from C\u00f3rdoba to Buenos Aires, the \u00d1anc\u00fa reached a level speed of 780 km/h, setting a new piston-engined speed record in South America, an achievement that has not been surpassed. Although the prototype was achieving design goals, the Fuerza A\u00e9rea Argentina was already considering the jet I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I as their future fighter program. With official interest diminishing, in early 1949, the sole flying prototype was badly damaged in a landing accident when test pilot Carlos Ferm\u00edn Bergaglio misjudged a landing and crashed. Although the pilot was uninjured and the aircraft could have been repaired, the Fabrica Militar de Aviones made a decision to abandon the project with the wrecked prototype, as well as the two unfinished prototypes still at the factory being scrapped. ==Variants== I.Ae.30 \u00d1anc\u00fa, c. 1948 The 3 variants of the I.Ae.30 ;I.Ae 30 \u00d1anc\u00fa: Fighter/Interceptor/Heavy fighter/Attacker variant, three prototypes built, one tested and crashed, two incomplete airframes later scrapped after the program was cancelled. ;I.Ae.30 Pallavicino I: Jet modification of the IAe-30 \u00d1anc\u00fa, also designed by Cesare Pallavicino, was to be a single-seat fighter plane in a class similar to the one of the Gloster Meteor. It featured the same fuselage as the normal IAe.30 \u00d1anc\u00fa but its inline engine nacelles were replaced with jet engine nacelles each having a Rolls-Royce Derwent engine each producing 3.500 lb static thrust. Its cockpit was replaced with a lengthened one featuring a full metal nose instead of the glazed nose of the \u00d1anc\u00fa. It was to have four 20 mm Hispano-Suiza autocannons \"in\" the nose instead of the 6 20 mm autocannons featured on the \u00d1anc\u00fa which were located \"beneath\" the nose. None built. ;I.Ae.30 Pallavicino II: Similar to the Pallavicino I but it featured lengthened swept wings and a more square looking tail. It was to be a light bomber/attacker with two crew: a pilot and a navigator. The navigator was to be seated either in a glazed nose or behind the pilot (then with a solid nose). Armament included four 20mm Hispano-Suiza autocannons and two bombs of 900 or 1,000 kg each in an internal bomb bay. It could also carry twenty 75mm air-to-ground rockets.
