He appointed Ralph Tabberer and Ann Irving as Deputy Directors and they recruited a strong team of curriculum and information specialists.http://www.edtechhistory.org.uk/history/the_1980s/mesu.html It set about identifying local authority needs and linking into subject associations. ==Supporting Advisory Teachers== In 1988 the Department for Education and Science (DES) set up the Information Technology in Schools (ITIS) initiative to oversee this area, headed by Phillip Lewis and supported by David Noble. It funded the deployment of 600 advisory teachers and the provision of hardware in schools through the payment of Education Support Grants (ESGs) to local authorities. Grants were made conditional on each LEA producing a policy statement and a five-year plan. MESU ran separate national conferences for the different subject advisory teachers, Mathematics, English, Science, Design and Technology and others. pulling together a resource pack for each to provide each with support in their local authority work. Some of National Curriculum Historyhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmchilsch/344/344i.pdf ==National Curriculum== Following legislation in 1988 schools had become more autonomous in making their own purchasing and staffing decisions. Of substantial importance was the inclusion of IT as a key component of the national curriculum for every student aged 5 to 16. This identified for the first time a core set of IT capabilities and stressed applying them across the curriculum. ==Merger with CET to form NCET== In 1988 MESU was merged with the CET by the DES, who funded both bodies, to form the National Council for Educational Technology. ==References== Category:Computer science education in the United Kingdom Category:Educational technology projects Category:United Kingdom educational programs ",
