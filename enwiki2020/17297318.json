    "text": "Keratocephalus (\"horned head\") is an extinct genus of tapinocephalian therapsids from the early Capitanian age of South Africa. It was found in the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone of the Karoo deposits, in the Lower Beaufort Beds in Beaufort West ==Description== Restoration Front view It was long, with long skull and had a mass of with a variable snout length, variable pachyostosis with a nasofrontal boss raised into a horn-like shape. ==Classification== Keratocephalus moloch, known from a number of greatly variable skulls, along with postcrania, from the Lower and Middle Tapinocephalus zone, shows considerable variability in the pachyostotic development. It may be not as derived as Tapinocephalus. The naso-frontal boss is raised into a sort of horn (hence the name - \"horned head\") and the length of the snout varies greatly. This in itself throws doubt on Boonstra's distinction between short and long-snouted forms. Pelosuchus, known only on the basis of postcranial features, is a synonym. ==Sources== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Tapinocephalidae at Paleos Category:Tapinocephalian genera Category:Guadalupian synapsids Category:Guadalupian synapsids of Africa Category:Fossil taxa described in 1931 Category:Taxa named by Friedrich von Huene Category:Capitanian genus first appearances Category:Capitanian genus extinctions ",
