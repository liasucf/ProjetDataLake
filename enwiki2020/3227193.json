The rulers of Mekala who seem to have come under the overlordship of the Vakataks were known as the Panvanshis of Mekala. The old country of Mekala lay about the present Amarkantak Hills and its name can be traced in the hills of the Maikal range. Some historians think that Mekala was a small tribe living in the tract of country, comprising the modern Amarkantaka hill and the surrounding territory. The Sohagpur and Amarkantak districts were given to the Rewa ruler after the 1857 upsurge, in lieu of the help given by the Rewa Chief in quelling the mutineers in Ramgarh (Mandla district) and other places. The district thereafter continued as a part of Shahdol district to be under the Baghel rule till 1947, when the Rewa State merged with Indian Union. The Bhonsles of Nagpur built the Narmada temple. Maharaja Gulab Singh belonging to the Baghel dynasty of Rewa constructed the outer boundary wall of the temple complex. The Kalchuris constructed the Machendranath and the Patleshwar temple at Amarkantak. These references establish that the district was ruled by Bhonsles of Nagpur and also Kalchuris earlier. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census, Anuppur district has a population of 749,237, roughly equal to the nation of Guyana or the US state of Alaska.
