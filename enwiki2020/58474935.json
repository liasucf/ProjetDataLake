The Railway Board Secretariat (Re-organisation and re-inforcement) Scheme was later codified in the form of statutory rules by promulgating the Railway Board Secretariat Service Rules, 1969 on the basis of Central Secretariat Service Rules, 1962. ==Organisational structure== The headquarters organisation of Government of India comprises a number of Secretaries of the Ministries and Departments. Most of the middle-level posts and a few administrative posts at the senior level in the Secretariat of these Ministries and Departments are manned by the officers of various Secretariat Services.
