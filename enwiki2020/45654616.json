    "text": "Poecilotheria striata, or the Mysore ornamental tarantula, is a large arboreal tarantula of the family Theraphosidae. It is endemic to India. ==Ecology== The species is found in dry and moist deciduous forests,at altitudes between 500 and 1000 m. It appears to be present in fewer than 10 severely fragmented locations. ==Conservation status== P. striata is classified as vulnerable due to its restricted and declining range and occupancy, and the ongoing fragmentation of its habitat. The species is commonly traded in the pet trade. A distribution survey published in 2015 found further population losses and suggested that the species be reclassified as Near Threatened. ==References== ==External links== *P. striata at ITIS *Genus Poecilotheria at CITES.org *Care of the related species P. pederseni striata Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders described in 1895 Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka ",
