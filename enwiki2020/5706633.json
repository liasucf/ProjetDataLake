FPD was founded in 1970 by Macon's First Presbyterian Church and has been described at the time of its founding as a segregation academy. ==History== First Presbyterian Day School was founded in 1970. The First Presbyterian church founded the school the same year that a judge ordered Bibb County public schools to desegregate. The campus was located in a mostly white suburban area, some distance away from the church's headquarters in a black neighborhood downtown. These factors have led the historian Andrew Manis to conclude that the school was a segregation academy established to allow white parents to avoid sending their children to racially integrated public schools. The school has been tax-exempt since 1971 and maintains a policy of non-discrimination. ==Demographics== The demographic breakdown of the 919 K-12 students enrolled in 2015-2016 was: *Asian - 1.7% *Black - 6.1% *Hispanic - 1.0% *White - 90.4% *Multiracial - 0.8% NCES does not gather demographic data for the 42 Pre-K students. ==Athletics== Since the fall of 2010, FPD has competed in the Georgia High School Association. 2010 was its last year in the Georgia Independent School Association.Jonathan Heeter (May 30, 2010).
