    "text": "Woods Bagot is a global architectural and consulting practice founded in Australia. It specialises in the design and planning of buildings across a wide variety of sectors and disciplines, including aviation and transport, education, science and health, lifestyle, sport and the workplace. Known originally for its work at the University of Adelaide, Woods Bagot expanded its horizons throughout the 20th century and is now established worldwide, with studios in five regions: Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. In 2015, the firm was named as the world's seventh largest architecture firm by employee count in Building Design magazine's World Architecture 100 list. Woods Bagot was also named as the 2009 Architects' Journal AJ100 International Practice of the Year. ==History== Woods Bagot's origins date back to 1869, when architect Edward John Woods was commissioned to improve and expand the design of St. Peter's Cathedral in Adelaide. In 1905 he joined forces with another prominent local architect, Walter Bagot, after many years' successful private practice. Woods retired from the practice in 1913; Bagot was subsequently joined by noted architect Louis Laybourne-Smith in 1917Woods Bagot Collection, Architecture Museum, University of South Australia and James Campbell Irwin, later Lord Mayor of Adelaide, in 1930.J. C. Irwin, Smith, Louis Laybourne (1880-1965), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 11, Melbourne University Press, 1988, pp 656-657.Bridget Jolly, Irwin, Sir James Campbell (1906-1990), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 17, Melbourne University Press, pp 576-577. The firm was incorporated as Woods Bagot Architects in 1975 and as Woods Bagot Pty Ltd in 1987. ==Architectural style== The design of the Adelaide Convention Centre's West Building echoes the local geology Inevitably for a firm with whose history spans more than a century, Woods Bagot has embraced a wide variety of architectural styles since its inception. Early Australian buildings such as Bonython Hall were built in the classical Gothic style popular at the time, but the firm's steady expansion into Asia, Europe and North America was accompanied by a corresponding shift in style and approach that embraced a variety of modern and progressive themes. The firm's latest work is often inspired by the natural world. The South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) building's exterior surface is inspired by a pine cone, for example, with a so-called 'living skin' designed for optimal passive solar performance. A new extension to the Adelaide Convention Centre, designed in association with American architect Larry Oltmanns, references local geological forms, in particular the distinctive colours and stratification of the South Australian landscape. Some recent designs have focused on philosophical as well as environmental and geological themes. The design of the Nan Tien Institute in Wollongong, New South Wales, reflects Buddhist teaching principles, specifically avoiding hierarchical components and providing a neutral environment free of materialism and excess. A new bridge and plaza connecting the Institute to the nearby Nan Tien Temple complex has been designed as a practical, mixed-use focus point for community gatherings, as well as a notable development in its own right. Outside Australia, the Cubism-inspired Cubus, a 25-storey retail tower completed in Hong Kong in 2011, is equipped with geometric lighting panels that emulate the shapes and forms of ice cubes. ==Notable projects== SAHMRI building, Adelaide 1 William Street, Brisbane Ham Yard Hotel courtyard, London Woods Bagot has designed some landmark buildings throughout South East Asia including the following major architectural projects: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Completed !!
