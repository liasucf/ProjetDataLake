    "text": "The following is an incomplete list of punk rock music festivals. This list may have some overlap with list of rock festivals and list of heavy metal festivals. Punk is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. By 1976 the first festivals were being organized.Christgau, Robert, \"Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk, by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain\" (review), New York Times Book Review, 1996.

Notes |- |European Punk Rock Festival | 1976 | | Mont de Marsan |style=\"text-align:left\"|In August 1976, the self-described \"First European Punk Rock Festival\" was held in Mont de Marsan in the southwest of France. Eddie and the Hot Rods, a London pub rock group, headlined. The Sex Pistols, originally scheduled to play, were dropped by the organizers who said the band had gone \"too far\" in demanding top billing and certain amenities; The Clash backed out in solidarity. The only band from the new punk movement to appear was The Damned.Strongman (2008), pp. 131\u2013132; Savage (1992), p. 216. Strongman describes one of the Sex Pistols' objectionable requests as \"some entourage accommodation\". Savage says they were dropped from the festival following a violent altercation between Sid Vicious, then part of the Sex Pistols' \"entourage\", and journalist Nick Kent at a Pistols gig. It is possible that the organizers were specifically afraid of Vicious's attendance. Organised by Zermati, took place at Mont-de-Marsan on 21 August 1976, and featured French bands Bijou, Il Biaritz and Shakin\u2019 Street, as well as The Damned. |- |100 Club Punk Festival | 1976 | | Oxford Street, London |style=\"text-align:left\"| A two-day event held at the 100 Club\u2014a typically jazz-oriented venue in Oxford Street, London, England\u2014on 20 and 21 September 1976.
