    "text": "La Revanche du berceau (French for \"the revenge of the cradle\") is a term for demographic threat by high birth rates from a minority and is specifically associated with French Canadians. The phrase originated in Quebec before the First World War, according to John Robert Colombo's \"Colombo's Canadian References.\"Colombo's Canadian References, Oxford University Press, 1976, p.444. It suggested that although English-Canadians dominated Canada in the 19th century, the high birth rate of French-Canadians in Quebec would allow resistance to British immigration and discrimination. The implication was that it would not be possible to discriminate against francophones if they remained numerous and competed with the anglophone Quebecers allowed to moved to Quebec. The phrase literally suggests, however, that French Quebecers might somehow avenge or reverse the Conquest of New France by Great Britain in 1759. Since the 1960s Quiet Revolution, however, Quebec has demonstrated a sub- replacement fertility rate, which has caused anxiety about the future of Quebec's culture and population. ==See also== *History of Quebec *Timeline of Quebec history *Demographic threat *Youth bulge *Multiculturalism *Aging of Europe ==References== Category:Demographics of Canada Category:Political history of Quebec ",
