Amid oppressive heat and high winds that created difficult scoring conditions, native Oklahoman Tommy Bolt won his only major championship, four strokes ahead of Gary Player. It was Player's debut in the U.S. Open at age 22. Bolt owned the 36-hole lead at 142 (+2), a stroke ahead of Player. After a third round 69 on Saturday morning, Bolt was at 211 (+1) and three strokes ahead of Gene Littler, who carded a 67 for 214 (+4). Littler fell back in the final round in the afternoon, shooting a 76 to finish in fourth place. Bolt ran away from the field with a final round 72 for 283 (+3), four ahead of Player. Bolt was the only player not to record a round of 75 or over during the championship. Ben Hogan, in search of his fifth U.S. Open title, was hampered by an injured left wrist and finished eleven strokes back in a tie for tenth. Eighteen-year-old Jack Nicklaus, in his second U.S. Open, made his first cut and finished in 41st place. Sam Snead missed the cut for the first time in 18 Open appearances. Two-time champion Gene Sarazen missed the cut in his final appearance, while three-time Masters champion Jimmy Demaret also played his final Open, withdrawing after the third round. It was the first of seven major championships at Southern Hills. The U.S. Open returned in 1977 and 2001 and the PGA Championship has been played at the course four times: 1970, 1982, 1994, and 2007. == Past champions in the field == === Made the cut === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Julius Boros || align=left| || 1952 || 71 || 75 || 72 || 71 || 289 || +9 || 3 |- | align=left|Ben Hogan || align=left| || 1948, 1950, 1951, 1953 || 75 || 73 || 75 || 71 || 294 || +14 || T10 |- | align=left|Dick Mayer || align=left| || 1957 || 76 || 74 || 71 || 78 || 299 || +19 || T23 |- | align=left|Cary Middlecoff || align=left| ||1949, 1956 || 75 || 79 || 75 || 71 || 300 || +20 || T27 |- | align=left|Lloyd Mangrum || align=left| || 1946 || 72 || 78 || 75 || 78 || 303 || +23 || T37 |- | align=left|Lew Worsham || align=left| || 1947 || 77 || 72 || 77 || 81 || 307 || +27 || T45 |} Source: === Missed the cut === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || Total || To par |- | align=left|Jack Fleck || align=left| || 1955 || 77 || 80 || 157 || +17 |- | align=left|Ed Furgol || align=left| || 1954 || 84 || 75 || 159 || +19 |- | align=left|Gene Sarazen || align=left| || 1922, 1932 || 84 || 80 || 164|| +24 |} Source: ==Round summaries== ===First round=== Thursday, June 12, 1958 {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T1 ||Tommy Bolt|| ||rowspan=3 align=center|71 || rowspan=3 align=center|+1 |- |Julius Boros || |- |Dick Metz || |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T4 || Lloyd Mangrum || || rowspan=2 align=center|72 || rowspan=2 align=center|+2 |- |Frank Stranahan || |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T6 || Bruce Crampton || || rowspan=2 align=center|73 || rowspan=2 align=center|+3 |- |Jimmy Demaret || |- |rowspan=4 align=center|T8 || Labron Harris || || rowspan=4 align=center|74 || rowspan=4 align=center|+4 |- |Gene Littler || |- |Smiley Quick || |- |Harvie Ward (a) || |} :(a) denotes amateur Source: ===Second round=== Friday, June 13, 1958 {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |align=center|1 || Tommy Bolt || || 71-71=142 || align=center|+2 |- |align=center|2 || Gary Player || || 75-68=143 || align=center|+3 |- |align=center|3 || |Frank Stranahan || || 72-72=144 || align=center|+4 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T4 || Julius Boros || || 71-75=146 || rowspan=3 align=center|+6 |- |Charles Coe (a) || || 75-71=146 |- |Labron Harris || || 74-72=146 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T7 || Jimmy Demaret || || 73-74=147 || rowspan=2 align=center|+7 |- |Gene Littler || || 74-73=147 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T9 || Bruce Crampton || || 73-75=148 || rowspan=3 align=center|+8 |- |Ben Hogan || || 75-73=148 |- |Tom Nieporte || || 75-73=148 |} :(a) denotes amateur Source: ===Third round=== Saturday, June 14, 1958 (morning) {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par |- |align=center|1 || Tommy Bolt || || 71-71-69=211 || align=center|+1 |- |align=center|2 || Gene Littler || || 74-73-67=214 || align=center|+4 |- |align=center|3 || Gary Player || || 75-68-73=216 || align=center|+6 |- |align=center|4 || Julius Boros || || 71-75-72=218 || align=center|+8 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T5 || Walter Burkemo || || 75-74-70=219 || rowspan=2 align=center|+9 |- |Frank Stranahan || || 72-72-75=219 |- |align=center|7 || Don January || || 79-73-68=220 || align=center|+10 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T8 || Charles Coe (a) || || 75-71-75=211 || rowspan=3 align=center|+11 |- |Dick Mayer || || 76-74-71=221 |- |Bob Rosburg || || 75-74-72=221 |} :(a) denotes amateur Source: ===Final round=== Saturday, June 14, 1958 (afternoon) {|class=wikitable !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Money ($) |- |align=center|1 || Tommy Bolt || || 71-71-69-72=283 || align=center|+3 || align=center|8,000 |- |align=center|2 || Gary Player || || 75-68-73-71=287 || align=center|+7 || align=center|5,000 |- |align=center|3 || Julius Boros || || 71-75-72-71=289 || align=center|+9 || align=center|3,000 |- |align=center|4 || Gene Littler || || 74-73-67-76=290 || align=center|+10 || align=center|2,000 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|T5 || Walter Burkemo || || 75-74-70-72=291 || rowspan=2 align=center|+11 || rowspan=2 align=center|1,625 |- |Bob Rosburg || || 75-74-72-70=291 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T7 || Jay Hebert || || 77-76-71-69=293 || rowspan=3 align=center|+13 || rowspan=3 align=center|1,016 |- |Don January || || 79-73-68-73=293 |- |Dick Metz || || 71-78-73-71=293 |- |rowspan=3 align=center|T10 || Ben Hogan || || 75-73-75-71=294 || rowspan=3 align=center|+14 || rowspan=3 align=center|566 |- |Tommy Jacobs || || 76-75-71-72=294 |- |Frank Stranahan || || 72-72-75-75=294 |} Source: ==References== ==External links== *About.com: 1958 U.S. Open *USGA Championship Database *USOpen.com \u2013 1958 Category:U.S. Open (golf) Category:Golf in Oklahoma Category:Sports in Tulsa, Oklahoma U.S. Open U.S. Open U.S. Open ",
