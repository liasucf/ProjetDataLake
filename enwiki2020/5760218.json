It was widely distributed from the 1950s onwards. There are numerous alternative versions, all portraits of tearful young boys or girls. In addition to being widely known, certain urban legends attribute a 'curse' to the painting. ==Curse== On 5 September 1985, the British tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that an Essex firefighter claimed that undamaged copies of the painting were frequently found amidst the ruins of burned houses. By the end of November, belief in the painting's curse was widespread enough that The Sun was organising mass bonfires of the paintings, sent in by readers.Steve Punt, \"Solved: Curse of the Crying Boy; Comic\u2019s Obsession with Painting\", The Sun, 9 October 2010, p.8. Steve Punt, a British writer and comedian, investigated the curse in a BBC Radio 4 production called Punt PI.Punt PI, Crying Boy episode (programme broadcast Sat 9 Oct 2010, BBC Radio 4) The conclusion reached by the programme, following testing at the Building Research Establishment, is that the prints were treated with a varnish containing fire retardant, and that the string holding the painting to the wall would be the first to deteriorate, resulting in the painting landing face down on the floor and thus being protected, although no explanation was given as to why no other paintings were turning up unscathed. ==See also== * The Hands Resist Him, also known as The eBay Haunted Painting ==References== Category:Curses Category:Italian paintings Category:Urban legends Category:1950s works Category:1950s prints ",
