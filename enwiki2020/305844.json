    "text": "The st\u00e8re as a cubic metre of stacked firewood The stere or st\u00e8re (st) is a unit of volume in the original metric system equal to one cubic metre. The name was coined from the Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 stereos, \"solid\", in 1793 France as a metric analogue to the cord. The st\u00e8re is typically used for measuring large quantities of firewood or other cut wood, while the cubic meter is used for uncut wood.For example: It is not part of the modern metric system (SI). In Dutch and German, a closely related unit called kuub (Dutch), short for kubieke meter, or \"Kubikmeter\" (German) which differs from a stere. Whereas a \"kuub\" or \"Kubikmeter\" is a solid cubic metre, as it was traditionally used for wood, a st\u00e8re (in German: Raummeter) is a cubic metre pile of woodblocks. A st\u00e8re or Raummeter is less than a kuub or full cubic metre of wood, because the spaces between the woodblocks are included in a st\u00e8re, while they do not count towards a kuub or Kubikmeter. In Finnish, the same unit is known as motti (from Swedish m\u00e5tt, \"measure\"). The st\u00e8re as used in contexts outside the timber industry is not subject to the same ambiguity.Webster 1913 In particular, st\u00e8re and kilost\u00e8re are sometimes used in hydrology, as the kilostere (1000 m3 or megalitre) is a slightly smaller metric analog of an acre-foot (approximately 1233 m3), similar to the relationship of the tonne to the short ton. ==See also== * Board foot * Cord * Cubic ton * Faggot (unit) * Forest product * Hoppus foot * List of unusual units of measurement * Metric units * Petrograd Standard * Units of measurement ==References== Category:Units of volume Category:Non-SI metric units Category:Logging et:Ruumimeeter ja:\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb ",
