    "text": "The 1904 New York Giants season was the 22nd season in franchise history. They led the National League in both runs scored and fewest runs allowed, on their way to 106 wins and the pennant. The first modern World Series had been played the previous year, but manager John McGraw and owner John T. Brush refused to play the American League champion Boston Americans in a 1904 World Series. They would change their position the following year. == Regular season == Team photograph The Giants had little offensive firepower in this pitching- dominated era but scored using a balanced lineup and a lot of small-ball tactics formerly employed by manager McGraw in his playing days. The lineup featured three of the top five stolen base leaders in the majors: Bill Dahlen, Sam Mertes, and Dan McGann. They also had one of the greatest pitching duos of all-time in Joe McGinnity and Christy Mathewson, who each had arguably the greatest seasons in their Hall of Fame careers. They combined for 68 wins \u2013 a 20th-century record for two pitchers on the same team.Great Baseball Feats, Facts and Figures, 2008 Edition, p. 100, David Nemec and Scott Flatow, A Signet Book, Penguin Group, New York, === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Notable transactions === * August 7, 1904: Doc Marshall was purchased from the Giants by the Boston Beaneaters.Doc Marshall page at Baseball Reference === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !
