    "text": "Ecclesiastes 5 is the fifth chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. The book contains philosophical speeches by a character called '(the) Qoheleth' (=\"the Teacher\"), composed probably between the 5th to 2nd century BCE. Peshitta, Targum, and Talmud attribute the authorship of the book to King Solomon. This chapter contains the advice on how to approach God the right way, and the discussion about poverty and wealth. ==Text== The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 20 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls 4QQoh (4Q109; 175-150 BCE; extant verses 13-17).Dead sea scrolls - Ecclesiastes. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). The Greek text is probably derived from the work of Aquila of Sinope or his followers. ==Structure== New King James Version grouped the chapter: * = Fear God, Keep Your Vows * = The Vanity of Gain and Honor ==The approach to God (5:1\u20137)== The lack of solution in chapter 4 on the theme of companionship leads the reader to think whether God is the answer, and this part shows how to approach God in the right way. ===Verse 7=== :For in the multitude of dreams and many words there is also vanity. But fear God. NKJV *\"Fear God\" here is in the literal sense, just as respect and awe before God can be found to be central values in wisdom literature. ==The poor under oppressive bureaucracy (5:8\u20139)== Qoheleth points to the frustration of the poor facing delays to obtain justice due to oppressive bureaucracy and tiers of hierarchy. \"He that is higher than the highest regardeth\" (KJV), from Hebrew ,Hebrew Text Analysis: Ecclesiastes 5:8. Biblehub is also translated as \"the high official is watched by a higher\" (NRSV), not referring to an official of any government bureaucracy, but rather ambitious people who strive to be higher than others. However, there will always people higher than those, ultimately pointing to God as the highest one. ==The Problems and Inadequacies of Wealth (5:10\u201320)== This section starts by stating three concise points about financial greed (verses 10\u201312): the lover of money never have enough; increasing resources will result in bigger financial commitments; more wealth causes less peace. The rich man could not pass any of the wealth to their offsprings (verse 14) nor take anything to the next life (verse 15). The whole passage of 5:8 to 6:9 is arranged as such that the outer sections will point to the center at verse 20. Qoheleth reiterates his earlier conclusion that God's gift is the ability to find enjoyment in the wealth, which keep humans occupied in life, so that \"they should not much call to mind the days of their lives\". ===Verse 20=== :For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. ESV As God gives joy to people as the antidote to their obsessions, people should not think too much ahead but to enjoy the present. ==See also== * Related Bible parts: Ecclesiastes 2 ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==External links== * Jewish translations: ** Kohelet \u2013 Ecclesiastes - Chapter 5 (Judaica Press) translation [with Rashi's commentary] at Chabad.org * Christian translations: ** Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) * Ecclesiastes Chapter 5 King James Version * Various versions 05 ",
