I talked very little but would get down to the business of rehearsing immediately. A woman must be better than a man if she is to conduct prestigious groups, and I made it my career always to be 100 percent prepared and know all the scores tremendously well.

She has the breadth and depth of knowledge and perceptive ability to delve into little - known scores and present new and different listening experiences. That she was able to combine in her programs new music with little - known classical compositions made a unique contribution to the American musical scene. Why would a conductor choose this direction? She [Petrides] answers, 'I needed to attract attention in order to receive the support of a listening public as well as support from the higher echelon in the music circle of fine musicians and critics. There was a wealth of music on library shelves and it had not been explored. There were works by classical composers and these had never been performed in America. Modern works needed public performances, too. People are instinctively attracted to new listening experiences--how else can there be musical growth? I continually accomplished this goal by offering something different.'\"Jane Weiner LePage (1931\u20132008) Women composers, conductors, musicians of the twentieth century, volume ii p.219 Scarecrow Press, Inc.
