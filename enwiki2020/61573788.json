He is a performer(dancer) of J-Pop dance and vocal group Sandaime J Soul Brothers and a former member of Gekidan Exile. For his solo career as a rapper he uses the stage name CrazyBoy. He debuted as a soloist in collaboration with Exile Shokichi in the song \"THE ANTHEM\" on June 4, 2014, and released his first solo album NEOTOKYO FOREVER on July 4, 2018. As a member of Sandaime J Soul Brothers, he has received the Japan Record Awards twice and he has choreographed some of the most famous dances for his group, including the famous \"Runningman\" dance of R.Y.U.S.E.I.. He is also an enthusiastic Fortnite player, hoping to promote e-sports in Japan. Elly's father is former OPBF's Super Welterweight Champion and his younger brother, Likiya, is also a dancer and leader of the J-pop dance and vocal group group The Rampage from Exile Tribe. == Early life == Elly was born on September 21, 1987, to a Japanese mother and an Afro-American father. His father is former OPBF's Super Welterweight Champion Carlos Elliott and his younger brother, Likiya, later followed the example of Elly and became a dancer too. When he was in junior high school, his friends gave him the nickname \u201cELLY\u201d, which is short for his surname Elliott, and he continued to use \u201cELLY\u201d as his stage name.Sanma no manma on Fuji Network System , Guest: Sandaime J Soul Brothers, broadcast on December 14th, 2013. Elly had played baseball since he was young and was the catcher and the fourth player in the batting order (the cleanup hitter, often the one with the most power and ability to drive in runs with extra-base hits) in his high school baseball team. After losing to Hachinohe Gakuin Kosei High School in the Quarter-final of the Regional High School Summer Baseball Tournament in his third year, Elly's dream to play in Koshien ended. One of his opponents in this crucial game was Sakamoto Hayato, who continued to become a professional baseball player and still remembered Elly as his opponent when the two met after they both earned fame in different fields. Elly entered Tokyo University of Agriculture with a baseball scholarship, hoping to become a professional baseball player after his graduation. Elly began to dance and produce music at a very young age. Since there is an American Military Camp in his hometown Misawa, he grew up in a city with much influence from American culture. He bought a set of DJ equipment with his pocket money when he was still a sixth- grade elementary school student, learned how to DJ from the manager of the local CD shops and started to rap soon after in junior high. In high school, he started dancing after seeing B2K's movie You got served. He was amazed by the dancers in the movie, and learned his first dance moves by imitating the dances from the movie with his brother.Sandaime J Soul Brothers LIVE TOUR 2012 \u300c0\uff5eZERO\uff5e\u300ddocument, released on March 13, 2013.Sh\u00fbkan Exile on Japan News Network, March 15, 2016's broadcast. After he moved to Tokyo to attend university, he continued to practice dancing at night after a day of baseball practice. It was during these busy days when he saw the performance of the dance team \u201cBASE HEADS\u201d at a club in Shibuya, that he decided he wanted to be a dancer just like them at the very moment. As a result, he quit university and baseball in the second year of his studies, chasing his dream to become a professional dancer. == Career == === 2007-2010: Early Days: The Team and Gekidan Exile === Elly formed the Hip-Hop dance crew THE TEAM in 2007, which marked his debut in the professional dance world. Apart from performing at clubs and events, he also appeared as a backup-dancer in the music videos of singers like Toshinobu Kubota and Meisa Kuroki. In March 2010, Elly was scouted by EXPG Studio (a talent school run by LDH) to perform in Gekidan Exile's play NIGHT BALLET as a guest dancer. He joined the actor group Gekidan Exile Kazegumi (the team of wind) in April of the same year, officially joining LDH at the same time while remaining hopeful about becoming part of one of their dance and vocal groups in the future. In May 2010, he performed in Gekidan Exile's 4th play DANCE EARTH ~Negai~. === 2010-present: Sandaime J Soul Brothers === On July 19, 2010, when LDH announced that they wanted to revive dance and vocal group J Soul Brothers and form Sandaime J Soul Brothers, Elly was selected as the first member (performer) of the new group, joining Naoto and Naoki Kobayashi, who were also members of the previous J Soul Brothers line-up. On September 27, Elly made his first public appearance as a performer of Sandaime J Soul Brothers during the Fantasy Goya-sai: Exile Tamash\u012b (FANTASY\u5f8c\u591c\u796d\uff5eEXILE\u9b42\uff5e; FANTASY Late Night Festival ~EXILE Soul~) live performance from Exile at Toyota Stadium. On November 10, he made his major debut as a member of Sandaime J Soul Brothers as the group released their debut single, \"Best Friend's Girl\", debuting at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart. On July 19, 2011, He officially withdrew from Gekidan Exile. In August 2012, Sandaime J Soul Brothers' seventh single \"0 ~Zero~\" which included their major hit \"Hanabi\", was released and became their first single to sell over 100.000 copies. Elly choreographed the dance for \"Hanabi\", which marked the first time he choreographed for his group. At the end of the year, Elly and his group appeared on the stage of NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen for the first time, performing their single \"Hanabi\". With 2014 becoming an important year for Sandaime J Soul Brothers, Elly gained greater fame alongside his group. On April 12, the movie Crows Explode was released, in which he made his acting debut by playing Suzuran's new first-year boss Yamashita Gohei. He also started to become active as a rapper, featuring in Exile Shokichi\u2019s song \"THE ANTHEM\", which was released on June 4. On June 25, Sandaime J Soul Brothers' major hit \"R.Y.U.S.E.I.\" was released. The song topped the Oricon Singles Charts at number one, selling 162.174 copies in the first week of its release. Additionally, Elly's choreography, especially the \"running man\" dance move during the chorus, became a national fever. The song also won Sandaime J Soul Brothers the Japan Record Award and skyrocketed the group to mainstream success. On January 28,2015, Sandaime J Soul Brothers released their fifth album, PLANET SEVEN, which sold 508 thousand copies in the first week after its release. He also landed his first leading role in the action film Trash, which was released on October 24. On March 30, 2016, Sandaime J Soul Brothers released their 6th album, THE JSB LEGACY. It included \"Feel So Alive\", the first song of the group Elly took part in as rapper. Even though his voice began to appear in the songs of Sandaime J Soul Brothers more often after that, he continued to be simply be referred to as a performer in the group, not a vocalist. On April 23, the second season of the drama High&Low;: The Story of S.W.O.R.D. was broadcast, which is part of the action and music franchise produced by the LDH. Elly plays ICE, a former mercenary and the leader of MIGHTY WARRIORS. As the High&Low; franchise continued and more films, concerts, games and shows were produced in the following years, Elly continued to reprise his role in those follow-ups. In 2018, on a program of LDH TV,the exclusive members-only streaming service of LDH, Elly challenged himself to be a Record producer. Together with Sandaime J Soul Brothers' vocalist Hiroomi Tosaka, he produced singer CRAZY SHIKAKKEI (\"Crazy Quadrilateral\") as rapper adviser and record producer. CRAZY SHIKAKKEI is the alias used by Masayasu Yagi in this \"Super Star Project\", and \"WANAWANA\", the first single of CRAZY SHIKAKKEI, was released on October 19,2018, debuting at number one on downloading charts. === 2016-present: CrazyBoy === For LDH, a management company that focuses on producing dance and vocal groups, there used to be a strict difference between vocalists who sing and performers who dance in their groups (though it has become common for vocalists to follow the choreography too). Elly entered LDH as a performer but never gave up his love for Rap and Hip Hop and tried to produce music on his own. To get support from his company and debut as a rapper, he created his own albums and handed them out to the staff and Hiro, the CEO of LDH, showing them what kind of music he could make and asked for advice.Break Out on TV Asahi , December 19, 2018's broadcast. He also got the support from his fellow Sandaime J Soul Brothers group mates and other members of Exile Tribe. In conclusion, Elly successfully debuted as a rapper in collaboration with Exile Shokichi in the single \"THE ANTHEM\" on June 4, 2014, still under the name of Elly. After the success of \"THE ANTHEM\", his solo project as a rapper was slowly approved by the company and finally given a go. Since then it has become more common for performers in LDH's groups to follow his example and rap. After Elly was featured as a rapper in Sandaime J Soul Brothers' track \"Feel So Alive\" in 2016, he officially started to use CRAZYBOY as his rapper alias. He explained that he gave himself this name because he has always been given comments such as \u201cyou certainly got crazy ideas\u201d by people around him and because he likes the idea that \"crazy\" can mean \u201ccool\u201d in L.A.. Besides, he also wants to live up to the principle of \"never forget the pure heart of a boy and fight on\". As a result, he combined the words \u201cCrazy\u201d and \"Boy\u201d and called himself CRAZYBOY. As CRAZYBOY, Elly began to made guest appearances in the works of other famous musicians. He joined ANARCHY in producing his new song, \"HELLA RICH feat. CRAZYBOY\", which was released in July 2016. His collaboration with Dancehall Reggae group Mighty Crown \"Around The World\" was released shortly after in the same month.
