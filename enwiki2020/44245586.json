    "text": "The Quispe Girls () is a 2013 Chilean film written and directed by Sebasti\u00e1n Sep\u00falveda. It is based on the true story of the Quispe sisters and on Juan Radrig\u00e1n's play \"Las Brutas\".http://www.outofthewings.org/db/play/las- brutas.html == Plot == The film is based on the story of sisters Justa, Luc\u00eda and Luciana Quispe, three goat-herders from the Chilean altiplano, the home of the indigenous Colla people. In 1974, the altiplano (highlands) goat-herders were concerned their animals were losing economic value as rumours about the military government expanded and reached the more isolated corners of the country. Affected by the recent loss of another of their sisters, and frightened by the news that the military had reached the area of Copiapo, Justa, Luc\u00eda and Luciana committed suicide by hanging themselves from a rock (along with their two dogs). The film's suicide scene was performed on the same rock where the real incident occurred, and the role of Justa Quispe was played by her niece, Digna Quispe. Movie director and screenwriter Sebasti\u00e1n Sep\u00falveda says about his first encounter with Digna Quispe: \"I was very afraid of Digna when I first met her. She don't shake hands, she \"shake\" just the fingers, and in a very cold way\", later she would accept a part in the project. Digna's harsh personality was considered a reflection of her life in the Altiplano, and her personality as such, left a mark on the film.\"A Digna yo le ten\u00eda mucho miedo cuando la conoc\u00ed. Ella no da la mano, sino que da los dedos, y de una forma muy fr\u00eda\", Sebasti\u00e1n Sep\u00falveda, al recordar sus primeros encuentros con la sobrina de las Quispe, quien luego acept\u00f3 interpretar a su t\u00eda Justa. Digna se sum\u00f3 as\u00ed al equipo que integraban Catalina Saavedra y Francisca Gavil\u00e1n en los roles de Luc\u00eda y Luciana, respectivamente. www.emol.com, Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez Castillo, September 9, 2014, retrieved on October 29, 2014 == Cast == * Alfredo Castro as Fernando * Francisca Gavil\u00e1n (Violeta Parra on Violeta Went to Heaven) as Luciana Quispe * Digna Quispe (the Quispe sisters' niece) as Justa Quispe * Catalina Saavedra as Luc\u00eda Quispe == Awards == * Venice Film Festival Critics' Week, best cinematography. * Lima Film Festival Critics' Award, and best cinematography. * Festival Filmar, Switzerland Best Film. * Lakino Film Festival Best Film. * Mar del Plata International Film Festival Mention Best Film. * CINEMATROPICAL AWARDS 2015.

Digna, though brilliant, was illiterate and had no acting experience, with one reviewer saying her performance did not blend with those of Francisca Gavil\u00e1n and Catalina Saavedra, the other two main characters.Las ni\u00f1as Quispe (ES) \"Lo que complica la verosimilitud del trabajo de estas tremendas actrices es que la tercera hermana est\u00e1 interpretada por Digna Quispe, heredera de las m\u00edticas hermanas y una persona que en toda su corporalidad y expresi\u00f3n da cuenta de la relaci\u00f3n que existe desde su origen con el mundo que la rodea y la define\".CR\u00cdTICAS & ESTUDIOS \"Las ni\u00f1as Quispe: el drama sin dolor\" Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile, Antonella Estevez, retrieved on October 28, 2014 * The Hollywood Reporter also gave a positive review, saying: \"Sebastian Sepulveda's beautifully written, played and shot feature debut is as dark, pure and bleak as the lives of its subjects.\"The Hollywood reporter critic The hollywood reporter, Agoust 31, 2013 by Jonathan Holland == References == == External links == * Category:Films shot in Chile Category:2013 films Category:2013 drama films Category:Chilean films Category:French films Category:French drama films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films about Latin American military dictatorships Category:Films set in 1974 Category:Films set in Chile Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u20131990) Category:Chilean films based on plays ",
