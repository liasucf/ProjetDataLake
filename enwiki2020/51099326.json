Gonz\u00e1lez and Maria Gragirena y Mijarez de Gonz\u00e1lez. At the age of five, she entered the Colegio de Lourdes where she began to study piano. A year later, she composed her first piece titled \"Blanca, la ni\u00f1a Ang\u00e9lica\" (Blanca, the girl Ang\u00e9lica). At the age of eight, she travelled with her parents to Cura\u00e7ao, Netherlands Antilles, and entered the Welgelegen Habaai School where she studied French and English in addition to piano, violin, and musical composition, concluding with a Baccalaureate in 1917. Then, she moved to Paris to continue her studies of piano and composition in addition to singing under the tutelage of Jean Roger-Ducasse, Arthur Honegger and Charles Koechlin. ==Career== When she returned to Venezuela two years later she composed 16 pieces of musical theatre, a collaboration with poetess Olga Capriles, and the musician and composer Juan Vicente Lecuna. In 1918 she married the German Federico Wolf and they moved to Puerto Cabello. They had three children, Waldemar, Irma, and Ivan Wolf Gonz\u00e1lez, but divorced afterward. She went on to marry the violinist and composer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Escobar Saluzzo (1877-1970) in Caracas. With this union, she had another son, Toney Escobar Gonz\u00e1lez. With Saluzzo, and the musician/composer Pedro Antonio R\u00edos Reyna, in addition to other artists, she initiated the instrumental vocal group \"Quintet \u00c1vila\" of which she was a singer and arranger.
