Named after Mara Boland, a horse trainer, mountaineer, and photographer from Santa Ynez, the mountain was first ascended during the American Top of The World Expedition of 1998 and was visited again in the 2003 Expedition led by Dennis Schmitt. The first climb to the summit was on July 14, 1998 in five hours by the team members of the Top of The World Expedition and it was later named Mara Mountain on July 6, 2003 in the 2003 Expedition for the northernmost island in the world. The team then had six members, including Mara Boland. ==See also== *List of mountains in Greenland *Nordkrone == References == Category:Mountains of Greenland ",
