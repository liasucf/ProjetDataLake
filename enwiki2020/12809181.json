    "text": "Sir Charles William Hayward, CBE (3 September 1892 \u2013 3 February 1983) was an English businessman, investor, and philanthropist. ==Early Family== Sir Charles was the second child of John Hayward, a cycle manufacturer, and Martha (Mary) Hayward (n\u00e9e Williams). On the early death of his father in 1894, Sir Charles and his older sister Marion Daisy were raised by their maternal grandmother, Sarah Ann Williams (n\u00e9e Patten), a locksmith 'employer at home' at Church Lane, Wolverhampton. In 1908, Martha (Mary) Hayward (n\u00e9e Williams), Charles's birth mother, became the second wife of Joseph Stevens, the father of Harry, Joe junior, Jack and George Stevens who founded A. J. Stevens & Co (AJS) in 1909. ==Career== Hayward began his career as an engineering apprentice, setting up his own business at the age of 19. He initially manufactured engineering patterns before moving into the emerging sidecar industry. Hayward's customers included AJS who bought his company in 1920, but retained him as Managing Director. In 1928 Hayward moved to London to pursue a new career as a stockbroker and industrialist. He founded Electric & General Industrial Trusts Ltd. which in turn led to the formation of the Firth Cleveland Group of Companies. This eventually had 23 factories in the UK as well as operations in the Netherlands, West Germany, South Africa and Australia. The Group was sold to GKN in 1970. ==Hayward Foundation== In 1961 Sir Charles set up the Hayward Foundation which donated millions of pounds to charity. It also financed the building of the Hayward Homes for the Elderly in Dunstall Road, Wolverhampton, where the Hayward family once lived. ==Honours== Hayward was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1938 and was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1970. He was further honoured with a knighthood in 1974. ==Family life== Hayward married Hilda Arnold in 1915 and remained so until her death in 1971. The Hilda Hayward Swimming Pool was named in remembrance of her. The couple had one son, Jack Hayward, who was born in 1923. In December 1972, Charles Hayward married his business partner, the former Company Secretary of Firth Cleveland, Elsie Darnell George. They purchased the Crown Tenancy of the island of Jethou near Guernsey, and lived there until Sir Charles's death. re: changes made 26 September 2019: Information from consultation with Sir Jack Hayward in 2012 during visit with my second cousin in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. ==References== ==External links== * Wolverhampton Local History Society - A.J.S Category:1983 deaths Category:1892 births Category:English chief executives Category:English investors Category:English philanthropists Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Businesspeople awarded knighthoods Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:20th-century philanthropists ",
