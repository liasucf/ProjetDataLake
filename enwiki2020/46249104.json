Theodor Haagaas and Einar Haffner were joint editors from 1925 to Haffner's death in 1935, and Haagaas was sole editor from 1935 to 1959. In 1959, Harald Sogn replaced Haagaas as editor. The last editions were edited by Kjell Gj\u00e6venes. The series was originally published by H.J. Haffners Forlag, and was later published by N. W. Damm & S\u00f8n. Prior to 1940, some editions appeared under the title Haagaas og Haffner.John Solheim, 125 \u00e5r: N.W.
