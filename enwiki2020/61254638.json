    "text": "Jimmie Fails (born November 10, 1994) is an American actor. His first lead role in a feature film was the titular role in the semi-autobiographical film The Last Black Man in San Francisco. == Life and career == Fails was born and raised in San Francisco. Until he was three years old, he lived in a Victorian house that his grandfather, a Baptist preacher, had bought in the predominantly Black middle-class Fillmore district of San Francisco. After his grandfather died, the house was foreclosed on because his relatives could not afford the expense, and he spent the remainder of his childhood in foster care and public housing. Only he and his father remained in the city; the rest of the relatives moved out. Fails attended Archbishop Riordan High School, and later attended college but left after one year. Growing up, Fails met Joe Talbot at the park that divided their neighborhoods. They soon became close friends and first began making short movies together during high school. Their short film, Last Stop Livermore, made in collaboration with Joe's brother Nat, was a finalist in the Golden Gate Awards. Their second, official short, American Paradise, premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Talbot and Fails conceived of the film The Last Black Man in San Francisco as teenagers. Fails and Talbot created a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 to fund it. Danny Glover, a San Francisco native, called Fails directly to express his interest in the film. The film is semi-autobiographical and tells the story of a fictionalized version of Fails, played by the actor, who attempts to reclaim a Victorian home built by his grandfather in a gentrified area of San Francisco. The film was Fails' first professional acting role. The film received positive critical reviews. In 2019, Talbot and Fails formed a production company called Longshot Features. == Personal life == Fails resides in San Francisco. == References == == External links == * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century African-American people Category:21st-century American male actors Category:Male actors from San Francisco Category:African-American actors Category:African-American film producers ",
