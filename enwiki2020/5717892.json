    "text": "Heino Puuste (born 7 September 1955 in Lagedi) is a retired Estonian javelin thrower who represented the USSR and later Estonia. He finished fourth at both the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 1983 World Championships, and won a silver medal at the 1982 European Championships. He also won bronze medals at the Universiade in 1979 and 1981. On May 6, 1983, he threw at Birmingham a new Soviet record of 94.20 meters, eclipsing the old mark (and former world record) of 93.80 by J\u0101nis L\u016bsis. This record was never beaten as increasing distances and frequent flat or ambiguous landings prompted a change to a new javelin design, effective starting in 1986. Puuste later became an athletics coach, most notably coaching the 2005 javelin throw world champion Andrus V\u00e4rnik. ==Personal life== Heino Puuste's father-in-law was basketball player Ilmar Kullam. ==References== * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Estonian male javelin throwers Category:Soviet male javelin throwers Category:People from Rae Parish Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of the Soviet Union Category:Estonian athletics coaches Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Goodwill Games medalists in athletics Category:Universiade bronze medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Star, 4th Class Category:Medalists at the 1979 Summer Universiade Category:Medalists at the 1981 Summer Universiade ",
