In addition, the Junior Boys have won nine WCSSAA titles, including the 2013 title and the girls Rugby team has eight WCSSAA titles. Also, the Girls Basketball teams have had a great run since 2011, winning both a Senior and Junior WCSSAA title and appearing in two CWOSSAA championship games and losing this year's WCSSAA title after going undefeated through the regular season.
