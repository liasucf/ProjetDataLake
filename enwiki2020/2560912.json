He was brought to the United States under the aegis of Daniel Frohman, a Broadway producer. He started his film career in 1911 and in 1913 moved to the Essanay Studios. In 1915, he began appearing in Chaplin's comedies and continued through Chaplin's Mutual Film comedies. His last appearance in a Chaplin film was a small role in The Great Dictator, released in 1940.allmovie bio on Leo White, by Hal Erickson White also acted in and directed Triple Trouble (1918), Essanay's last Chaplin release. Chaplin himself acknowledged Triple Trouble in his autobiography but did not actually participate in its production. (White filmed new scenes around existing footage of Chaplin.) White typically played dapper, continental villains or noblemen in films, and this typecast him for the rest of his screen career. Well into the 1940s, he was still playing excitable Frenchmen in short subjects and feature films. Before his death in 1948, White had appeared in over 400 films. White died in Glendale, California, of a heart attack at the age of 65 on September 20, 1948. He was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale. ==Filmography== * In and Out (1914, Short) - Fritz * One Wonderful Night (1914) - Jean de Curtois * Leading Lizzie Astray (1914, Short) - Cafe Patron (uncredited) * Madame Double X (1914, Short) * Fatty's Faithful Fido (1915, Short) * His New Job (1915, Short) - Office Receptionist / Actor as Hussar Officer (uncredited) * A Night Out (1915, Short) - 'French' Dandy / Desk Clerk (uncredited) * The Champion (1915, Short) - Crooked Gambler (uncredited) * In the Park (1915, Short) - The Count - Elegant Masher (uncredited) * A Jitney Elopement (1915, Short) - Count Chloride de Lime - Edna's Suitor (uncredited) * The Tramp (1915, Short) - First Thief (uncredited) * Work (1915, Short) - The Secret Lover (uncredited) * A Woman (1915, Short) - Idler in the Park (uncredited) * The Bank (1915, Short) - Clerk (uncredited) * Shanghaied (1915, Short) - Third Shanghaied Seaman (uncredited) * A Night in the Show (1915, Short) - Frenchman / Negro in Balcony (uncredited) * Police (1916, Short) - Fruitseller / Flop House Manager / Policeman (uncredited) * The Floorwalker (1916, Short) - Elegant Customer * The Fireman (1916, Short) - Owner of the Burning House * The Vagabond (1916, Short) - Old Gypsy woman * The Count (1916, Short) - Count Broko (uncredited) * Max Wants a Divorce (1917, Short) - Loony Dancer (uncredited) * Back Stage (1917, Short) * The Hero (1917, Short) - The Count * Dough Nuts (1917, Short) - Camembert, the Proprietor * Cupid's Rival (1917, Short) - Rich Artist * The Villain (1917, Short) * The Millionaire (1917, Short) * The Goat (1917, Short) * The Fly Cop (1917, Short) - The Mayor * The Chief Cook (1917, Short) - Ham * The Candy Kid (1917, Short) * The Hobo (1917, Short) - Mr. Fox * The Pest (1917, Short) - The Count * The Slave (1917, Short) - The Vizier * The Stranger (1918, Short) - The Greaser * His Day Out (1918, Short) * The Rogue (1918, Short) - The Count * The Orderly (1918, Short) * Amarilly of Clothes- Line Alley (1918) - Manicurist (uncredited) * The Scholar (1918, Short) * The Messenger (1918, Short) * The Handy Man (1918, Short) * Bright and Early (1918, Short) - An honest crook * The Straight and Narrow (1918, Short) - Safecracker * Triple Trouble (1918, Short) - Count (uncredited) * The Brazen Beauty (1918) - Tony Dewey * He's in Again (1918, Short) - The Prize Fighter * Blind Youth (1920) - French Louis * An Adventuress (1920) - Prince Halbere * Fists and Fodder (1920, Short) - A Rival * Mrs. Temple's Telegram (1920) - John Brown * Pals and Pugs (1920, Short) - Beau Brummel * The Devil's Pass Key (1920) - Amadeus Malot * You Never Can Tell (1920) - Mr. Renan * Married to Order (1920, Short) - The Milkman * The Rookie's Return (1920) - Henri * Her Sturdy Oak (1921) - Archibald Mellon * The Rage of Paris (1921) - Jean Marot * Headin' West (1922) - Honey Giroux * Beyond the Rocks (1922) - Pageant Director (uncredited) * Blood and Sand (1922) - Antonio * Breaking Into Society (1923) * Why Worry?
