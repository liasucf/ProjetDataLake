It took place from 2015 until 2017, in parallel with the 2015-17 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Both Ireland and Afghanistan had been promoted to the main ICC ODI Championship and did not compete in this tournament. Instead, Kenya and Nepal were included in the tournament. The tournament was played in a round-robin format. All matches were recorded as List A matches, and those in which both teams had ODI status were also recorded as ODIs. The Netherlands won the tournament and joined the thirteen-team 2020\u201322 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. The Netherlands regained their ODI status after losing it at the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Inclusion in the ICC ODI League will mean they will play 24 fixtures against Full Members until 2022. The Netherlands, along with Scotland, Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong also joined the lowest ranked four teams from the ICC ODI Championship (as of September 2017) in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The bottom four teams, Kenya, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates and Namibia were all relegated to Division Two and played the finalists of Division Three for the remaining two spots in the 2018 CWC Qualifier. ==Teams== The following eight teams took part in the tournament based on the results from 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier and the 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two: * (1st in 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, New Zealand) * (2nd in 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, New Zealand) * (3rd in 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, New Zealand) * (4th in 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, New Zealand) * (1st in 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two, Namibia) * (2nd in 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two, Namibia) * (3rd in 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two, Namibia) * (4th in 2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two, Namibia) ==Fixtures== The breakdown of fixtures was as follows: During each round, each team played against their opponent twice. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Round !style=\"width:70px\"|Window !Home team !Away team !Match status !Result |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" |rowspan=4|1 |rowspan=4|May \u2013 July 2015 | | |List A |1\u20131 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |2\u20130 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |1\u20131 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |2\u20130 |- |rowspan=4|2 |rowspan=4|September \u2013 November 2015 | | |List A |0\u20130 |- | | |List A |0\u20132 |- | | |ODI |0\u20132 |- | | |List A |0\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" |rowspan=4|3 |rowspan=4|January \u2013 May 2016 | | |ODI |1\u20130 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |0\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |2\u20130 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |2\u20130 |- |rowspan=4|4 |rowspan=4|August \u2013 November 2016 | | |List A |1\u20131 |- | | |ODI |2\u20130 |- | | |List A |2\u20130 |- | | |List A |1\u20131 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" |rowspan=4|5 |rowspan=4|February \u2013 June 2017 | | |List A |0\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |1\u20131 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |ODI |1\u20131 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |1\u20131 |- |rowspan=4|6 |rowspan=4|September \u2013 October 2017 | | |List A |1\u20131 |- | | |ODI |1\u20131 |- | | |List A |1\u20131 |- | | |List A |1\u20130 |- |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" |rowspan=4|7 Simultaneous Round |rowspan=4|December 2017 | | |List A |0\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |0\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |ODI |2\u20130 |-style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | | |List A |0\u20132 |} ==Points table== ==Matches== ===Round 1=== The fixtures for round one were announced on 5 May 2015. \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 2=== The fixtures for round two were announced in August 2015. \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 3=== The fixtures for round three were announced in December 2015. \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 4=== The fixtures for round four were announced in April 2016.
