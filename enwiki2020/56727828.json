As a child, her father would speak Spanish to Vega and her brother, while her mother would communicate in English. When asked about her heritage, she said in a 2018 interview: > \"I feel very Spanish at times and then other times I\u2019ll feel very British. > Sometimes Spanish people can be very touchy and overly friendly and I can > feel a bit more distant. Other times, I\u2019ll be with British people and think, > oh they\u2019re very cold and distant and need some more Spanish in them!\u201d After taking improv classes and enjoying them, she left equestrian school at the age of seventeen to focus on her career as an actress. == Filmography == ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
