The entire route is municipally-maintained except for its concurrency with US 206 where it is maintained by the Mercer County D.O.T. ==Route description== CR 583 northbound approaching I-295 CR 583 begins at the border of Trenton and Ewing Township along two-lane undivided Princeton Avenue (southbound US 206) just northeast of the Prichard Street intersection. From the southern terminus, the road runs northeast concurrent with southbound US 206 through residential and commercial areas, forming the border between Ewing Township to the northwest and Trenton to the southeast. The road crosses CR 622, widening to four lanes before entering Lawrence Township at the CR 613 intersection. In Lawrence Township, Princeton Avenue comes to the CR 645 intersection that provides access to the Brunswick Circle and US 1 Business.

This interchange has all movements except from southbound I-295 to southbound CR 583, which is provided by way of CR 546. Following this interchange, CR 583 becomes undivided again and heads into a mix of farms and woods. The road forms a brief concurrency with CR 569 as it heads into areas of woodland and residences. The road enters Princeton, where it becomes Mercer Street, and briefly gains a median prior to crossing CR 533. After this intersection, the route passes Princeton Battlefield State Park. Here, CR 583 passes through wooded residential areas as it comes to its northern terminus at Route 27 (Nassau Street) just to the east of Route 27's southern terminus at US 206. == Major intersections == ==See also== * * ==References== == External links == *County Route 583 583 583 ",
