    "text": "Carlton Ray Scott Jr. (born December 5, 1969, in Semora, North Carolina) is an American country music artist. He first gained attention in 2005 with his debut album My Kind of Music, and has since released five albums and two EPS. ==Career== Scott has a distinctive southern voice and wears a cowboy hat. Warner Brothers released his debut album, My Kind of Music, and its title track became a top 40 single in 2005. Scott split from the Warner Brothers label two years later. He independently releases Crazy Like Me (2008) and Rayality (2011), which gave him a physical product on the road and support from Sirius XM. \"Drinkin Beer\" and \"Ain\u2019t Always Thirsty\" received SiriusXM airplay. And so did one of his most well-known singles, \"Those Jeans\" from the Rayality album, produced by Dave Brainard (Jerrod Neimann, Brandy Clark). Then came his 5th studio album in 2017 \u2014 Guitar for Sale, produced by Michael Hughes. Hughes and Scott paired up again for Honky Tonk Heart, the new EP released on March 1, 2019. According to Scott, \"\"Honky Tonk Heart\" is all about who I am, and it's an ode to all the troubadours out there runnin' up and down the highways keeping real country music alive because they love it, live it, and breathe it.\" Scott's second EP, Nowhere Near Done, was released in February 2020. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! width=\"45\"| US Country ! width=\"45\"| US Heat ! width=\"45\"| US Indie |- ! scope=\"row\"| My Kind of Music | * Release date: November 22, 2005 * Label: Warner Bros.
