It is loosely based on Peter Prince's novel of the same name. It marked the first credited appearance in a feature film of Stephen Fry. The film was produced for British television but received a theatrical release in the US. == Plot == Bill (Hopkins) is a man who is bitter about his recent divorce from his wife and the loss of custody of his only child. He acts out his anger by befriending another man, Roger (Broadbent), who has been sued for divorce by his wife, so that she can enter into a lesbian relationship with her lover. Bill tries to help the man out, by funding the latter's court case to regain custody of his child. Simon Callow plays an unscrupulous and sleazy barrister hired for the case. Soon Bill, who has focused his anger against feminism which he blames for robbing him of his family, begins to feel disgust for what he and his new friend are doing.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093103/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl ==Cast== * Anthony Hopkins as Bill Hooper * Jim Broadbent as Roger Miles * Harriet Walter as Emmy Hooper * Frances Viner as Cheryl Langford * Simon Callow as Mark Varda * Miriam Margolyes as Jane Powell * Joanne Whalley as Mary Hall * Michael Byrne as Leonard Scruby * Jennie Stoller as Bill's Friend * Johanna Kirby as Bill's Friend * Stephen Fry as Creighton * Clifford Rose as Judge * Harry Grubb as Bill's Son * Tom Jamieson as Roger's Son ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1985 films Category:British television films Category:British films Category:1985 drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Mike Newell Category:Films based on British novels Category:British drama films ",
