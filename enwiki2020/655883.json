    "text": "Dafne is the earliest known work that, by modern standards, could be considered an opera. The libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini survives complete; the mostly-lost music was completed by Jacopo Peri, but at least two of the six surviving fragments are by Jacopo Corsi. Dafne was first performed during Carnival of 1598 (1597 old style) at the Palazzo Corsi.Edmond Strainchamps, \"Corsi, Jacopo\" in New Grove. ==History== Dafne is scored for a much smaller ensemble than Claudio Monteverdi's slightly later operas, namely, a harpsichord, a lute, a viol, an archlute, and a triple flute. Drawing on a new development at the time, Peri established recitatives, melodic speech set to music, as a central part of opera.Jacopo Peri \u2013 Dafne page The story of Apollo falling in love with the eponymous nymph, Daphne, the opera was written for an elite circle of humanists in Florence, the Florentine Camerata, between 1594 and 1597, with the support, and possibly the collaboration, of the composer and patron Jacopo Corsi. An attempt to revive Greek drama, according to modern scholarship, it was a long way off from what the ancient Greeks would have recognized. Most of Peri's music has been lost, despite its popularity and fame in Europe at the time of its composition, but the 455 line verse libretto was published and survives. Florence's ruling Medici family was sufficiently taken with Dafne to allow Peri's next work, Euridice, to be performed as part of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV's wedding celebrations in 1600. ==See also== * La Dafne (Gagliano), 1608 * Dafne (Opitz\u2013Sch\u00fctz), 1627 ==References== ==External links== *Libretto with translation at HOASM *The Starry Messenger by Justin Fleming, a play about the first production of Dafne Category:Operas by Jacopo Peri Category:Pastoral operas Category:Italian-language operas Category:Operas Category:1597 operas Category:Operas based on Metamorphoses Category:European court festivities Category:Lost operas ",
