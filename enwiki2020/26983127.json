However, deaths among the leadership during the late 1760s reduced the Misl's power. ==Decline of Power== The Bhangi misl engaged in numerous power struggles with the Sukerchakia Misl until they were severely weakened at the Battle of Basin and the loss of Lahore to Ranjit Singh. Bhangi Misl held the possession of Zamzama, the famous cannon, which was at the time named Bhangi Toap, Bhangianwala Toap and Bhangian di Top, names it retains to this day.Singh, Khushwant A History of the Sikhs, Volume 1: 1469-1839.
