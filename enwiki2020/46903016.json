    "text": "In decision theory, competitive regret is the relative regret compared to an oracle with limited or unlimited power in the process of distribution estimation. ==Competitive regret to the oracle with full power== Consider estimating a discrete probability distribution p on a discrete set \\mathcal{X} based on data X, the regret of an estimator q is defined as : \\max_{p\\in \\mathcal{P}} r_n (q,p). where \\mathcal{P} is the set of all possible probability distribution, and : r_n(q,p) = \\mathbb{E} (D(p || q(X))). where D(p || q) is the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between p and q. ==Competitive regret to the oracle with limited power== ===Oracle with partial information=== The oracle is restricted to have access to partial information of the true distribution p by knowing the location of p in the parameter space up to a partition. Given a partition \\mathbb{P} of the parameter space, and suppose the oracle knows the subset P where the true p \\in P. The oracle will have regret as : r_n(P) = \\min_q \\max_{p\\in P} r_n (q,p). The competitive regret to the oracle will be :r_n^\\mathbb{P}(q, \\mathcal{P}) = \\max_{P \\in \\mathbb{P}} (r_n(q,P) - r_n(P)). ===Oracle with partial information=== The oracle knows exactly p, but can only choose the estimator among natural estimators. A natural estimator assigns equal probability to the symbols which appear the same number of time in the sample. The regret of the oracle is :r_n^{nat} (p)= \\min_{q\\in \\mathcal{Q}_{nat}} r_n(q,p), and the competitive regret is :\\max_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} (r_n(q,p) - r_n^{nat} (p)). ==Example== For the estimator q proposed in Acharya et al.(2013), : r_n^{\\mathbb{P}_\\sigma} (q, \\Delta_k) \\leq r^{nat}_n(q, \\Delta_k) \\leq \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} (\\min (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\frac{k}{n})). Here \\Delta_k denotes the k-dimensional unit simplex surface. The partition \\mathbb{P}_\\sigma denotes the permutation class on \\Delta_k, where p and p' are partitioned into the same subset if and only if p' is a permutation of p. ==References== Category:Game theory ",
