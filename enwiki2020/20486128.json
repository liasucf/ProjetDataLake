    "text": "Andreas Alm (born 19 June 1973, in G\u00e4llivare but grew up in Eskilstuna) is a Swedish football coach in charge of BK H\u00e4cken and a former football player. He formerly managed AIK and is also a former player for the club. During his active career he played for the two Stockholm rivals AIK and Hammarby IF in the Swedish Allsvenskan. He also played for IFK Norrk\u00f6ping in the Swedish Superettan and also in Norway and Kongsvinger IL for a short time. ==Commentating job== After his active career he showed up in Swedish television as a football commentator in the national channel TV4. ==Managerial career== ===AIK=== On 27 November 2008 he was appointed as a new assistant manager for AIK following the departure of former assistant Neboj\u0161a Novakovi\u0107 earlier the same month in protest against the board\u2019s decision to sack Rikard Norling.Andreas Alm ny assisterande tr\u00e4nare i AIK Together with other assistant manager Christer Sw\u00e4rd and manager Mikael Stahre, AIK managed to win both Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen during their first year together. The following year, AIK started by winning the Supercupen against the recent league runners-up IFK G\u00f6teborg. But the rest of the season became a big disappointment, and Stahre left the club for Greek outfit Panionios G.S.S. in April 2010. Alm remained as assistant manager during caretaker Bj\u00f6rn Wesstr\u00f6m's stay and later appointed Alex Miller's stay. When Miller and AIK during mutual consent split up, Alm later on was appointed as AIK's new manager in December 2010. Novakovi\u0107 rejoined the team staff as assistant manager together with Sw\u00e4rd. Alm became a successful coach for AIK and ended on the second place in both 2011 and 2013 in the Allsvenskan. ===Vejle Boldklub=== Alm was linked with a job at the vacant job at Br\u00f8ndby IF in May 2016,Medie: Br\u00f8ndby i dialog med svensk tr\u00e6ner, bold.dk, 12 May 2016 but was instead presented as the new manager of Vejle Boldklub 2 months later.Avis: Vejle f\u00e5r svensk tr\u00e6ner, bold.dk, 5 July 2016 After a disappointing season, finishing on the 9th place, Alm confirmed on 30 May 2017, that he wouldn't continue as the head coach of Vejle.Andreas Alm stopper i Vejle Boldklub, bold.dk, 30 May 2017 ===BK H\u00e4cken=== Alm was appointed as the head coach of BK H\u00e4cken on 8 December 2017, which is his second stint as coach in Allsvenskan.Andreas Alm tar \u00f6ver som tr\u00e4nare i BK H\u00e4cken , bkhacken.se, 8 December 2017 ==Honours== ===Manager=== ;BK H\u00e4cken *Swedish Cup: 2018\u201319 ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"5\"|Record |- !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % |- |align=left|AIK |align=\"left\"|Sweden |align=left|16 December 2010 |align=left|13 May 2016 | 196 || 103 || 42 || 51 || |- |align=left|Vejle Boldklub |align=\"left\"|Denmark |align=left|5 July 2016 |align=left|30 May 2017 | 35 || 11 || 11 || 13 || |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish football managers Category:AIK Fotboll managers Category:Swedish footballers Category:IFK Norrk\u00f6ping players Category:Kongsvinger IL Toppfotball players Category:AIK Fotboll players Category:Hammarby Fotboll players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Eliteserien players Category:Swedish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in Norway Category:Association football forwards Category:Swedish expatriate footballers Category:Allsvenskan managers ",
