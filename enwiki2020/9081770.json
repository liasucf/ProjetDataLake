They released two albums, The Truth (1995), which peaked in the top 60 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and Headspace (1997). == History == The Truth were formed in Melbourne in 1991 by Nicky Bomba (a.k.a. Nicholas Caruana) on drums, his older brother, Michael Caruana on keyboards, Tony Kopa on vocals and Geoff Wells on guitars. For about a year they held a residency at the 120 Bar, Fitzroy. In December 1992 they recorded their debut single, \"Secrets\". The band gained popularity, by performing around Melbourne, and from their tracks, \"My Heavy Friend\" and \"Secrets\", receiving airplay on national youth radio station, Triple J.Geoff Wells' mySpace page A live-in- the-studio version of \"My Heavy Friend\" was included on Triple J's compilation album by various artists, Live at the Wireless 3 (1993). As a consequence, \"My Heavy Friend\", was issued as their second single. Wells told Nicole Leedham of The Canberra Times, in November 1994, \"It's very rare to have overnight success and it's even rarer for someone who has it to stay around a while. If it was overnight success it was a bloody long night.\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, \"My Heavy Friend\" provided their nominations for Best New Talent and for Breakthrough Artist \u2013 Single. Their self-titled first studio album, The Truth (1995), was produced by Jim Hilbun (The Angels' bass guitarist) and appeared via Mushroom Records. It peaked in the top 60 on the ARIA Albums Chart. For touring the band had no traditional bass player: bass lines were provided by Michael \"Funkmeister\" Caruana on keyboards. For the band's second album, Headspace (1997), Mick Girasole was added on bass guitar and the group were re-branded as Truth. However, the band broke up toward the end of that year. Nicky Bomba formed the band, Bomba, in 1999 for whom Caruana played keyboards. Bomba also joined the John Butler Trio from 2003 \u2013 led by John Butler who was married to Bomba's and Caruana's youngest sister, Danielle Caruana (who performs as Mama Kin).
