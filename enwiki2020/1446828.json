    "text": "The Pronto Pup Company is a company based in Portland, Oregon that manufactures the Pronto Pup mix for hot dogs. It is also a restaurant in Rockaway Beach, Oregon. The Pronto Pup's flour mix is used for a batter to dip and then fry hot dogs. The Pronto Pup was invented by the husband and wife team of George and Versa Boyington in the late 1930s in Rockaway Beach, Oregon. The Boyingtons ran a small hot dog stand on the beach, selling the dogs to tourists and locals alike. When the rain came and ruined the buns, making them soggy and inedible, George Boyington came up with the idea of cooking a \"bun\" as needed. He created a pancake batter based mix and the duo came up with the formula used today. Pronto Pups are also a common food found in county fairs throughout Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, and North and South Dakota. They differ from the original by generally, but not always, using a bratwurst instead of a hotdog as the sausage. ==References== Category:Brand name hot dogs Category:Companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:Food and drink companies established in 1962 Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:1962 establishments in Oregon ",
