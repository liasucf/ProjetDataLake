    "text": "Map of Thailand. The October 1977 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat was a bloodless military coup which took place in Thailand on 20 October 1977, staged by the Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF). The coup was carried out under the nominal authority of Admiral Sangad Chaloryu of the Royal Thai Navy, head of the National Administrative Reform Council (NARC), but it was effectively led by General Kriangsak Chamanan of the Royal Thai Army, Supreme Commander of the RTAF. It led to the deposition of Prime Minister Thanin Kraivichien, who assumed the office following the 1976 coup d'\u00e9tat (which was also led by Admiral Sangad and resulted in the establishment of the NARCStaff report (Oct. 18, 1976). \"A Nightmare of Lynching and Burning\" Time.), in the immediate aftermath of the Thammasat University massacre. The October coup was preceded by the March 1977 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, staged by a group of younger Royal Thai Army officers known as the \"Young Turks\", led by General Prasert Thammasiri, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. Their attempted coup failed. The military justified their intervention in October because Thanin's government had divided the country, had virtually no public support, the economic situation had worsened, and people in general disagreed with such a long-term suspension of democracy. General Kriangsak assumed the office of Prime Minister, and served until his resignation in 1980. ==See also== * History of Thailand (1973\u20132001) * List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country#Thailand ==References== Category:1970s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts Coup d'\u00e9tat October Thai coup d'\u00e9tat October 1977 coup d'etat October 1977 Coup d'etat October Thai coup d'\u00e9tat October 1977 Coup d'\u00e9tat ",
