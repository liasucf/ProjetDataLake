On May 1, 2009, Arellano was beaten, shot, and set on fire by Latin Kings gang members after refusing to show a gang sign. Macedo, a member of Latin Kings, is said to have started the attack. Macedo was federally charged with fleeing to avoid prosecution. According to authorities, he was said to be living in Mexico (where he was eventually apprehended) or the southeastern United States. ==Recent events and capture== In 2016, Macedo was added to FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.
