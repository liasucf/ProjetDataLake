In the 1980s, UNIMA-USA awarded Davis five Citations of Excellence for his work. ==Early life and education== Davis was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1935. He was raised in Alexandria. His fascination with puppets began at the age of four, when he performed with hand puppets for family and friends. In 1945, when Davis was 10 years old, he saw a performance in Washington, D.C. It featured Frank Paris Marionettes and an Italian puppet company. Soon after, Davis and his father converted the family garage into a puppet theater. Davis began to perform for neighborhood children. Davis earned his B.A. in Fine Arts from the Richmond Professional Institute of the College of William and Mary. ==Career== ===Early career=== In the early 1960s, Davis worked in art studios, print shops, and advertising agencies. He left the job of art director at a New York agency to become a freelance graphic designer and part-time puppeteer. He also spent time as an actor and folk singer. Davis directed the Repertory Puppet Theater of Washington, D.C. He created serious work for adults with puppets. This included plays from Samuel Beckett, Japanese folk plays, and medieval miracle plays. In the early 1970s, Davis co-directed The National Theater of Puppet Arts, Inc. with Carol Fijan. Based in New York, the company of puppeteers produced excerpts from Shakespearean plays and Greek classics. ===Puppet Showplace Theater=== In 1977, Davis moved from New York to Brookline, Massachusetts. He became artistic director and artist-in-residence at Puppet Showplace Theater. At Showplace, Davis worked mostly with hand puppets for audiences of children and families.
