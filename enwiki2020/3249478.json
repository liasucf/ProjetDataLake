    "text": "James Horace Parks (12 May 1903 \u2013 21 November 1980) was a cricketer who played for Sussex County Cricket Club and England. Parks was a right-handed opening batsman and a medium-pace bowler of inswingers. He was a regular member of the Sussex county team from 1927 and scored 1,000 runs in every season except one up to 1939, when his first-class career ended with the Second World War. In 1935, he did the all-rounder's \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, but nothing in Parks' career suggested he was an out-of-the-ordinary county cricketer -- until 1937. In that year, by scoring 3,003 runs and taking 101 wickets in the season, he set a record that is all but certainly never to be equalled. Only 13 cricketers have scored more than 2,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in an English season; no other cricketer has ever taken 100 wickets while scoring 3,000 runs. His run total included 11 centuries and he also took 21 catches. Having earlier in his career been termed \"solid\", Parks revealed in 1937 a full range of previously unsuspected strokes and was praised by Wisden for his \"enterprise\". Parks was called up for the 1937 Test match against New Zealand at Lord's alongside another debutant, Leonard Hutton.Cricinfo: New Zealand in England Test Series - 1st Test, 1937 season He scored 22 and 7 and took three wickets, but was never chosen again. Unsurprisingly, he was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1938. After World War II, Parks played Lancashire League cricket and he was coach at Sussex for a period in the 1960s. == See also == * Double (cricket) ==References== == External links == * Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Commonwealth XI cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Players cricketers Category:English cricket umpires Category:English cricket coaches Category:People from Haywards Heath Category:1903 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:L.
