    "text": "The Sweden national under-17 football team () is the football team representing Sweden in competitions for under-17-year-old players. The Swedish U17 team came into existence following the realignment of the UEFA European Under-16 Championship, which changed to be an under-17 competition in 2002. In the 2013 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, Sweden reached the semi-finals where they were knocked out on penalties by Russia. In the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup they finished in third place after beating Argentina with 4\u20131 in the third-place match. Valmir Berisha scored three goals in the match and thus became the top scorer of the tournament. ==Competitive record== Champions Runners-up Third place Fourth place Tournament held on home soil ===FIFA World Cup=== ====Under-16 era==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" !colspan=9|FIFA U-16 World Championship record !width=1% rowspan=23| !colspan=6|FIFA U-16 World Championship qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1985||colspan=8 rowspan=3|Did not qualify |12 |6 |4 |2 |12 |6 |- | 1987 |2 |0 |1 |1 |3 |4 |- | 1989 |2 |0 |1 |1 |2 |4 |- !Total !Never qualified !0/3 !0 !0 !0 !0 !0 !0 !16 !6 !6 !4 !17 !14 |} ====Under-17 era==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" !colspan=9|FIFA U-17 World Cup record !width=1% rowspan=23| !colspan=6|FIFA U-17 World Cup qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1991||colspan=8 rowspan=11|Did not qualify |5 |3 |1 |1 |7 |2 |- | 1993 |4 |0 |0 |4 |1 |14 |- | 1995 |6 |3 |1 |2 |7 |6 |- | 1997 |2 |1 |0 |1 |2 |1 |- | 1999 |5 |3 |0 |2 |12 |7 |- | 2001 |2 |1 |1 |0 |3 |1 |- | 2003 |3 |1 |0 |2 |10 |4 |- | 2005 |3 |1 |1 |1 |3 |2 |- | 2007 |6 |1 |2 |3 |8 |12 |- | 2009 |3 |1 |0 |2 |4 |4 |- | 2011 |3 |0 |1 |2 |0 |4 |- bgcolor=\"#cc9966\" | 2013 |Third place |3rd |7 |4 |1 |2 |15 |11 |10 |5 |5 |0 |19 |5 |- | 2015||rowspan=3 colspan=8|Did not qualify |6 |1 |2 |3 |3 |12 |- | 2017 |6 |3 |0 |3 |14 |8 |- | 2019 |9 |3 |1 |5 |16 |18 |- | 2021 ||colspan=8|To be determined |colspan=6 |To be determined |- !Total !Best: Third place !1/16 !7 !4 !1 !2 !15 !11 !73 !27 !15 !31 !109 !100 |} ===UEFA European Championship=== ====Under-16 era==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=9|UEFA European Under-16 Championship record !width=1% rowspan=46| !colspan=6|UEFA European Under-16 Championship qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1982||colspan=8 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |6 |3 |3 |0 |8 |2 |- | 1984 |6 |3 |1 |2 |4 |4 |- | 1985 |Group stage |6th |3 |2 |0 |1 |8 |7 |4 |0 |3 |1 |3 |7 |- | 1986 |Group stage |14th |3 |0 |1 |2 |0 |4 |2 |1 |1 |0 |4 |2 |- | 1987||colspan=8 rowspan=1|Did not qualify |2 |0 |1 |1 |3 |4 |- | 1988 |Group stage |5th |3 |1 |2 |0 |3 |2 |2 |1 |1 |0 |8 |3 |- | 1989||colspan=8 rowspan=1|Did not qualify |2 |0 |1 |1 |2 |4 |- | 1990 |Group stage |7th |3 |1 |2 |0 |6 |3 |2 |2 |0 |0 |7 |3 |- | 1991 |Group stage |8th |3 |2 |0 |1 |2 |1 |2 |1 |1 |0 |5 |1 |- | 1992||colspan=8 rowspan=3|Did not qualify |2 |1 |0 |1 |2 |3 |- | 1993 |4 |0 |0 |4 |1 |14 |- | 1994 |4 |1 |0 |3 |4 |5 |- | 1995 |Quarter-finals |8th |4 |1 |1 |2 |3 |6 |2 |2 |0 |0 |4 |0 |- | 1996||colspan=8 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |2 |1 |0 |1 |3 |5 |- | 1997 |2 |1 |0 |1 |2 |1 |- | 1998 |Group stage |13th |3 |0 |2 |1 |2 |4 |3 |2 |1 |0 |8 |5 |- | 1999 |Group stage |12th |3 |1 |0 |2 |3 |5 |2 |2 |0 |0 |9 |2 |- | 2000||colspan=8 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |3 |1 |0 |2 |3 |4 |- | 2001 |2 |1 |1 |0 |3 |1 |- !Total !Best: Quarter-finals !8/19 !25 !8 !8 !9 !27 !32 !54 !23 !14 !17 !83 !70 |} ====Under-17 era==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=9|UEFA European Under-17 Championship record !width=1% rowspan=25| !colspan=6|UEFA European Under-17 Championship qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 2002||colspan=8 rowspan=11|Did not qualify |2 |0 |0 |2 |0 |3 |- | 2003 |3 |1 |0 |2 |10 |4 |- | 2004 |3 |0 |1 |2 |1 |5 |- | 2005 |3 |1 |1 |1 |3 |2 |- | 2006 |6 |2 |2 |2 |12 |10 |- | 2007 |6 |1 |2 |3 |8 |12 |- | 2008 |6 |2 |2 |2 |9 |12 |- | 2009 |3 |1 |0 |2 |4 |4 |- | 2010 |6 |3 |2 |1 |9 |4 |- | 2011 |3 |0 |1 |2 |0 |4 |- | 2012 |6 |3 |2 |1 |8 |3 |- bgcolor=\"#cc9966\" | 2013 |Semi-finals |3rd |4 |1 |3 |0 |2 |1 |6 |4 |2 |0 |17 |4 |- | 2014||colspan=8 rowspan=2|Did not qualify |6 |1 |1 |4 |3 |9 |- | 2015 |6 |1 |2 |3 |3 |12 |- | 2016 |Quarter-finals |6th |4 |2 |0 |2 |3 |3 |6 |3 |2 |1 |10 |6 |- | 2017||colspan=8 rowspan=1|Did not qualify |6 |3 |0 |3 |14 |8 |- | 2018 |Quarter-finals |8th |4 |2 |0 |2 |4 |3 |6 |2 |4 |0 |12 |2 |- | 2019 |Group stage |15th |3 |0 |0 |3 |3 |9 |6 |3 |1 |2 |13 |9 |- | 2020||colspan=8 rowspan=1|Cancelled |3 |2 |0 |1 |7 |7 |- | 2021||colspan=8 rowspan=2|To be determined | | | | | | |- | 2022 | | | | | | |- !Total !Best: Semi-finals !4/18 !15 !5 !3 !7 !12 !16 !92 !33 !25 !34 !143 !120 |} ==See also== * Sweden national football team * Sweden Olympic football team * Sweden national under-21 football team * Sweden national under-20 football team * Sweden national under-19 football team * FIFA U-17 World Cup * UEFA European Under-17 Championship * Nordic Under-17 Football Championship ==References== ==External links== * SvFF Team 2003 page * SvFF Team 2004 page Category:European national under-17 association football teams F ",
