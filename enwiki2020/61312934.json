    "text": "Wirreanda Creek is an ephemeral watercourse in the Far North region of South Australia. From the confluence of Pendowaga Creek (north tributary) and Cameron Creek (south tributary), about east of Cradock township, it flows generally westwards to join Kanyaka Creek, about southwest of the historic Kanyaka Station homestead. The flows ultimately end up crossing through the Flinders Ranges into Lake Torrens via Willochra Creek. ==See also== *List of rivers of South Australia ==References== Category:Rivers of South Australia Category:Flinders Ranges ",
