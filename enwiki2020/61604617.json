KJID-LP's studio is located at 520 Bow St., in downtown Tyler. ==History== Iglesia de Dios Jesuchristo Manantiales de Vida received a construction permit to build a low power Class L1 FM radio station, licensed to Tyler, on February 5, 2015. The facility was modified twice, through subsequent amendments to the license, and received a License to Cover from the Federal Communications Commission on August 1, 2016. It airs a Spanish language religious format. Due to the low power of the Class L1 facility, KJID-LP's signal is limited to the city center population within Loop 323, as well as northern areas outside the Loop, still in close proximity to the city center. ==References== ==External links== JID-LP JID-LP Category:Radio stations established in 2016 JID-LP ",
