Tim & Bob have discovered and or worked on some of the biggest artists in the music industry and has helped develop the Atlanta music scene as it is widely known for today. They have won three Grammy Awards amongst twelve nominations and have sold more than 300 million albums worldwide making them one of the most successful producer duos in music history. They are among the most consistent urban producers in the last 18 years, earning a spot on Billboard's top ten list of producers almost every year since 1998. In 2017, Bob Robinson produced the smash hit \"My Man\" for Tamar Braxton. The single peaked at number three in August. It remained on the chart for 22 weeks. ==Biography== Growing up in Peoria, Illinois, Tim was raised on R&B; through his father's band. His father was a trumpet player and multi-instrumentalist so Tim learned trumpet, piano, guitar, drums and bass at the age of 10. From elementary school through college, Tim played the trumpet and piano in school band. Bob played in his church as an organist and piano player from the age of 9, so he brought an understanding of gospel music to the duo. Tim met Bob through a mutual friend at the local mall. The two worked together at Tim's house in the basement, recording music on equipment purchased by Tim's mother. They moved to New Orleans for a year then went to Chicago and Detroit where they established a small production company with a studio. ==D.A.R.P. Inc. and Other Label Ventures== ===1993\u20131996=== In Atlanta, Tim & Bob met Dallas Austin who signed them to his company D.A.R.P. and stamped them as \"Tim & Bob\".

Tim & Bob won two Grammy Awards, including one in 1995 for Best R&B; Album for Boyz II Men's II and one in 1996 for Best R&B; Album for TLC's Diamond certified CrazySexyCool. Tim & Bob produced and wrote five songs on the Boyz II Men LP II which eventually became the biggest selling album in history by an R&B; group. Upon winning consecutive Best R&B; Album Grammy awards, the duo worked on songs for the films Def Jam's How to Be a Player, The Players Club, Poetic Justice, Wild Wild West, and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. Tim & Bob were frequently brought in by producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to work on some of their projects. == DreamWorks and Capitol Records == ===1997\u20131999=== Tim & Bob relocated to Los Angeles and signed a publishing deal and a label deal through executive and rock guitarist Robbie Robertson with the now defunct DreamWorks Records, soon scoring a No. 1 hit with Jon B. (\"They Don't Know\"), and a top 5 hit for Tamia (\"So into You\"). Tim & Bob were also instrumental in getting the rock group Papa Roach signed to DreamWorks while inking a production deal with Capitol Records. The duo signed Athena Cage from the group Kut Klose and produced a full album of songs, but the project only produced a single for the movie Save The Last Dance. ====Thong Song==== In 1999 Tim & Bob produced Sisq\u00f3's hit \"Thong Song\".

According to Tim Kelley, the decision was mutual, as it was over creative differences in the duo's sound. Kelley said \"Bob is like my brother, I love him man. I think creatively, everything changed. Times have changed now that everybody has access to all of the technology. He started doing stuff that just wasn\u2019t sounding like the Tim & Bob sound. I was doing all of the drum patters and sampling. I\u2019ll give you an example, \u201cSlow Down\u201d by Bobby V is constructed of chopped up samples I put a beat over with Bob playing guitar which created a style I came up with called \"Asian R&B;'. Skip up years later Bob started doing production on his own without me present which I urged him too, but the sound was more smooth Jazz where as together we were known to be aggressive with the sound, creative drum samples and minimal chord progressions on uptempos. Me and Bob had a conversation and we decided creatively, he wanted to try it on his own\". After their split, Kelley became Vice President of Urban Music and Head of A&R; for record label, SoNo Recording Group, where he signed and produced albums for acts like Brian McKnight, Take 6, Shawn Stockman, Raheem DeVaughn and his longtime collaborator Bobby V. In 2017, Bob Robinson produced the smash hit \"My Man\" for Tamar Braxton. \"My Man\" debuted at number 29 on the Adult R&B; Songs Billboard chart for the week of May 13, 2017, and peaked at number three in August. It remained on the chart for 22 weeks. The track also reached number 21 on the Hot R&B; Songs Billboard chart for the week of August 26, 2017. Meanwhile, Kelley has eight songs currently in the top 50 Adult R&B; Billboard chart, two in the top 20 with Brian McKnight \"When I'm Gone\" sitting at number 13 and Raheem DeVaughn's \"Just Right\" which is currently number 20. ==Discography== ==Awards and nominations== ===American Music Awards=== The American Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony created by Dick Clark in 1973. |- |rowspan=\"3\" | || rowspan=\"2\"| Boyz ll Men || Favorite Soul/R&B; Album || |- | Favorite Pop/Rock Album || |- | TLC || Favorite Soul/R&B; Album || |- |rowspan=\"1\" | || Sisqo || Favorite Soul/R&B; Album || |- |rowspan=\"2\" | || Chris Brown || Favorite Soul/R&B; Album || |- | Pitch Perfect 2 || Favorite Soundtrack || ===Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Awards=== The Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Awards are sponsored by Billboard magazine and is held annually in December. |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 1998 ||rowspan=\"1\"| Jon B. || Hot R&B; Single of the Year || |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 1998 ||rowspan=\"1\" |Jon B. || Hot R&B; Single Sales || |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2000 ||rowspan=\"1\"| Sisqo || R&B;/Hip Hop Single of the Year || |- |rowspan=2| 2001||rowspan=2|Case || R&B;/Hip Hop Single of the Year || |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2005 ||rowspan=\"1\"|Bobby V || R&B;/Hip Hop Single of the Year || ===Blockbuster Entertainment Awards=== |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 1995 || rowspan=\"2\"| Boyz ll Men \"II\" || Favorite CD || |- | Favorite R&B; CD || |- |rowspan=1| 2001 || Joe \"My Name Is Joe\" || Favorite Male Artist R&B; CD || ===Broadcast Music Inc.
