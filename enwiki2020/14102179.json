Romanesca was a melodic-harmonic formula popular from the mid 16th to early 17th centuries, used as an aria formula for singing poetry and as a subject for instrumental variation. It was most popular with Italian composers of the early Baroque period. It was also used by vihuelistas including Luis de Narv\u00e1ez, Alonso Mudarra, Enr\u00edquez de Valderr\u00e1bano, and Diego Pisador. Originating in Spain as O gu\u00e1rdame las vacas (\"O let us put the cows to pasture\" or, \"look after the cows for me\",Turnbull, Harvey (1974).
