    "text": "The Texas A&M; Aggie ring is a rite of passage for students at Texas A&M; university. The most visible way for graduates of Texas A&M; to recognize each other is by the Aggie Ring. The Aggie Ring is worn by current students and alumni, and is one of the most well-known symbols of the Aggie Network. == History and appearance == The Texas A&M; ring was formally adopted in 1889. The current Aggie Ring was designed by E. C. Jonas in 1894, and the design has remained relatively unchanged since, with the only major change coming when the school's name was changed from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A&M; University in 1963. The top of the Ring depicts an eagle and shield. The shield at the top of the Ring symbolizes protection of the reputation of the alma mater. The thirteen stripes in the shield represent the thirteen original states and symbolize patriotism. The five stars in the shield refer to the facets of student development: mind, body, spiritual attainment, emotional poise, and integrity of character. The eagle denotes agility, power, and ability to reach great heights. On one side of the Ring is a large star, borrowed from the seal of the state of Texas. The oak leaves symbolize strength. On the other side of the Ring are a cannon, a saber, and a rifle, symbolizing Aggies' preparedness and valor in defending their land. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas symbolize allegiance to both nation and state. Traditionally, students wear their Rings with the class year facing them to signify the fact that their time at A&M; is not yet complete. At the annual Ring Dance, or at the end of the student's collegiate career, the student turns his Ring around so that the class year faces away, symbolizing readiness to \"face the world.\" For decades, though unsanctioned and discouraged by the University, an unofficial tradition among willing students involves \"dunking\" the newly acquired Aggie Ring. The Ring is dropped in a pitcher of beer and the student chugs the entire pitcher and catches the Ring in his or her teeth. The Dixie Chicken, among other bars, has been one of the more popular venues for dunking Aggie Rings, though it no longer endorses the activity. Some students choose to dunk their Rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages. == Requirements to receive the ring == The Aggie Ring cannot be purchased unless specific requirements are met: a current student must be in good standing with a minimum 2.00 GPA on a 4.00 scale. In addition, the student must have completed 90 hours of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&M.; Graduate students may receive a Ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed. If a graduate degree requires a thesis, the ring will be delivered on Aggie Ring Day if the thesis has been defended by the deadline set by the Office of Graduate Studies. If the thesis has not been defended by this date, the Aggie Ring will be held until the qualification is met. A Ph.D. student may receive their Ring if they have completed all formal coursework in the degree plan, has a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, has successfully completed the residency requirement, has successfully passed the preliminary exam, and has an approved research proposal on file. A Ring may be purchased upon graduation if a student, either undergraduate or graduate, did not meet these criteria while pursuing the degree. Many students receive their Rings on Aggie Ring Day, which is held at the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center three times yearly. Aggie Ring Day is a special time for Aggies, their family, and their friends to celebrate being a part of the Aggie Network. The Association of Former Students gave out over 11,000 Rings at Aggie Ring Days in 2012. == References == Category:Texas A&M; University ",
