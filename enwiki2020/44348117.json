    "text": "The Karen Fraser Woodland Trail is a paved rail trail in Thurston County, Washington that connects the cities of Olympia and Lacey along the abandoned Burlington Northern corridor. The trail opened in 2007 and connects with the Chehalis Western Trail at the border between the two cities. The Olympia trailhead features a sustainably designed shelter and restroom with a living roof and a rain garden and parts of the trail run alongside Indian Creek. In 1990, Olympia residents Jim and Carol Rainwood suggested the creation of the trail and formed the Woodland Trail Greenway Association who contributed time and resources to trail development. Their work resulted in the creation of the Olympia Woodland Trail and the Lacey Woodland Trail. On October 3rd 2017, the two trails were renamed with a single name to honor former State Senator Karen Fraser who previously represented the area. Future phases will extend the trail west, through Watershed Park, crossing the Deschutes River, and ending at Tumwater Falls. The future Deschutes Valley Trail will start at Tumwater Falls and continue the trail to Pioneer Park. == External links == * Karen Fraser Woodland Trail Website (Olympia Section) * Karen Fraser Woodland Trail Website (Lacey Section) == References == Category:Protected areas of Thurston County, Washington Category:Rail trails in Washington (state) ",
