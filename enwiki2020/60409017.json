Wagner had run for re-election on November 4, 1964 against Albert I. Nagle. The returns of the votes from the polls indicated that Nagle led by less than 600 votes.The Morning Call, Allentown, Pa., November 4, 1964, p.14 Attention then focused on 2,800 absentee ballots. When the Board of Elections met to count these, both candidates immediately entered challenges to a substantial number of the ballots before the envelopes containing those ballots were opened. After a hearing the Board filed its decision overruling the challenges in some instances and sustaining them in others. Both candidates then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County questioning the legality of the Board's decision. Subsequently, the court ruled to sustain the decision of the Board in part and reversing it in part. Wagner then filed an appeal. By the time the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided to affirm, the next election cycle had taken place (November 1966), and neither Wagner nor Nagle were able to claim the seat.See Westlaw, Pennsylvania Reporter, The Absentee Ballots Case, 423 Pa. 504 (1966) After he retired from politics, Wagner became president of the First National Bank, Tamaqua.
