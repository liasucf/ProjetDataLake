    "text": "Tyndale Monument The Tyndale Monument is a tower built on a hill at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, England. It was built in honour of William Tyndale, a translator of the New Testament, who was born nearby. It is a Grade II* listed building. The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111 ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb to the top of the tower, up a spiral staircase of 121 steps. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn. A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. The path follows a rough fairly steep bridleway which is part of the Cotswold Way. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The stairway has automatic lighting. The Cotswold Way long- distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley. The door to the tower is always open. Locally, it is commonly called Nibley Monument rather than its official name. The hill is called Nibley Knoll or occasionally Nibley Knob. There is a commemorative plaque on the front of the tower. The text engraved on it reads: William Tyndale. :ERECTED A.D. 1866 :IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF :WILLIAM TYNDALE :TRANSLATOR OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE :WHO FIRST CAUSED THE NEW TESTAMENT :TO BE PRINTED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE :OF HIS COUNTRYMEN :BORN NEAR THIS SPOT HE SUFFERED :MARTYRDOM AT VILVORDEN IN :FLANDERS ON OCT 6 1536 The monument is a landmark that can be seen for miles, even in places as far as Bristol over 20 miles away. In the town of Thornbury there is a street called Tyndale View where the tower can be seen from approximately 10 miles away. Further down the Cotswold Edge, at Hawkesbury, is the Somerset Monument, erected in 1846, and the design of the Tyndale tower has features in common with this. In October 2019 protesters from Extinction Rebellion used the monument to display a protest banner. ==References== ==External links== *Illustrated London News, November 17th 1866 - Monument opening announcement Category:Monuments and memorials in Gloucestershire Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1866 Category:Towers in Gloucestershire Category:1866 establishments in England ",
