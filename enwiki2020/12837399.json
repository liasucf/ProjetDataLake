At the beginning of 2008, there were over 800 mostly local WISPs that had enormous market share of the Internet access. It is estimated Wi-Fi ISPs have about 350 000 subscribers by 2007. The Czech Republic has the most Wi-Fi subscriber in the whole European Union.2007 WiFi survey EN openspectrum.info - Czech Republic There are both commercial and community wireless networks. ===Mobile=== Mobile internet is quite popular. Plans based on either GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or CDMA2000 are being offered by all four mobile phone operators (T-Mobile, Vodafone, Telefonica O2 and U:fon). The average cost for 1.5 GB of mobile internet plan ranges around 25 Euro/month. Various traffic shaping (monthly data limits after which the speed dramatically decreases) are used under common name \"Fair Use Policy\". ;Comparison of mobile data plans {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- !

The start-up of ADSL was very slow due to overpriced plans (~\u20ac350 per month for 1024/256 kbit). At the beginning of 2004, local loop unbundling began, and alternative operators started to offer ADSL (and also SDSL). This, and later privatisation of Cesky Telecom, helped to drive down prices. On July 1, 2006, \u010cesk\u00fd Telecom was renamed to Telef\u00f3nica O2 Czech Republic. As of 2009, ADSL2+ was offered in three variants, mostly without data limits (Fair User Policy - limiting link speed based on amount of transferred data). The speed varied depending on the loop length up to 20 Mbit/s. The typical ADSL/VDSL (no limits/No data cap) connection offered is from 20/2Mbit up to 100/10Mbit. For short local loops, 250/25 Mbit/s plan is offered by some VDSL3 (G.Fast) internet providers. Speeds and overbooking vary per each ISP. === Cable === Cable internet is gaining popularity with its higher download speeds up to 1000 Mbit/s. The biggest ISP, UPC (which has bought another CATV internet provider Karneval in 2007) is providing its service in big cities and attractive locations (Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Liberec, Usti nad Labem, Olomouc, \u0160umperk, Uni\u010dov, Jesen\u00edk). ;UPC Prices (2017) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- !

An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.

The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.
