    "text": "The R755 road is a regional road in Ireland. It runs for its entire length in County Wicklow. From the village of Kilmacanogue on the N11 national primary road it goes north/south for to the town of Rathdrum. ==Route== From the N11 it goes west through the Rocky Valley and then turns south and rises sharply at the foot of the Sugar Loaf Mountain and crosses the Calary Bog to a junction with the eastern end of the Sally Gap road (R759) north of Roundwood village. It continues south through Roundwood and the hamlet of Annamoe to Laragh where it meets the Military Road and the Wicklow Gap Road. From Laragh it follows the Avonmore River for through dense conifer forests and oak woods before terminating in the town of Rathdrum at a junction with the R752. Like the other main regional roads in the Wicklow Mountains, the R115, R759, R756, R752 and R747 this road passes through some wonderful scenery. ==Photo gallery== File:IMGroundwoodR755 4112w.jpg|R755 passing through Roundwood File:R755 road signs.png|R755 road signs ==See also== *Roads in Ireland *National primary road *National secondary road *Clara, County Wicklow ==References== *Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2006 \u2013 Department of Transport Category:Regional roads in the Republic of Ireland Category:Roads in County Wicklow ",
