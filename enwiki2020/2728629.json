    "text": "The Telegram & Gazette (and Sunday Telegram) is the only daily newspaper of Worcester, Massachusetts. The paper, headquartered at 100 Front Street and known locally as the Telegram or the T & G, offers coverage of all of Worcester County, as well as surrounding areas of the western suburbs of Boston, Western Massachusetts, and several towns in Windham County in northeastern Connecticut. The ownership corporation, Worcester Telegram & Gazette Corp., was a wholly owned subsidiary of The New York Times Company (publisher of The New York Times and The Boston Globe) from 2000 to 2013. In 2013, the New York Times Company sold both the T & G and the Globe to John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox, although Henry told staff at the Worcester paper he intended to sell it as soon as possible. In 2014, Henry sold the paper to Halifax Media Group. In 2015, Halifax was acquired by New Media Investment Group.New Media Announces Agreement to Acquire Halifax Media Group for $280.0 Million == History == On January 22, 1913, the Worcester Telegram ran a story (\"Thorpe with Professional Baseball Team Says Clancy\"), soon picked up by other papers, that led to Jim Thorpe being stripped of his 1912 Olympic titles, medals and awards.Golus, Carrie. Jim Thorpe. Twenty First Century Books, 2008: Minneapolis, p. 71. Until the 1980s, two papers\u2014the Worcester Telegram in the morning and the Evening Gazette in the afternoon\u2014were published by the same company, with separate editorial staffs in some departments. The two were merged into a single Telegram & Gazette upon their acquisition by Chronicle Publishing Company, publishers of the San Francisco Chronicle, in 1986. The Chronicle sold the Telegram & Gazette to The New York Times Company in 1999. The paper's previous owners also owned Worcester radio station WTAG until selling it after the newspapers were divested, in 1987. In 2018, owner GateHouse Media acquired Holden Landmark Corporation, owner of the alternative weekly Worcester Magazine. ===Circulation=== * 1999: 107,400 * 2012: 74,563 (weekday) * 2018: 22,400 (weekday) == Sections and features == Headquarters at 100 Front Street The weekday Telegram & Gazette contains national, state and local news, as well as sports, business, and a feature stories.
