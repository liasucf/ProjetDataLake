    "text": "The Three-Cornered Hat is a 42-minute classical studio album in which the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Andr\u00e9 Previn perform the whole of Manuel de Falla's ballet The Three-Cornered Hat and, as a filler, the Ritual Fire Dance from his ballet Love the Magician. The longer work's two brief vocal passages are sung by the American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade. The album was released in 1983. ==Recording== The booklet accompanying the CD release of the album does not name its producer or engineer or reveal where it was taped, but does state that it was recorded digitally.Falla, Manuel de: The Three- Cornered Hat, cond. Andr\u00e9 Previn, Philips CD, 411 046-2, 1984 ==Cover art== Apart from minor differences in lettering, the covers of the American and British LP, cassette and CD versions of the album are all the same, and were designed and illustrated by Chris Verschoor. ==Critical reception== A statue of Manuel de Falla in Avenida de la Constituci\u00f3n, Granada, Spain Edward Greenfield reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in April 1983, comparing it with previous recordings of The Three-Cornered Hat conducted by Ernest Ansermet,Falla, Manuel de: The Three-Cornered Hat, cond. Ernest Ansermet, Contour Classics LP, CC 7560, 1962 Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de BurgosFalla, Manuel de: The Three-Cornered Hat, cond. Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos, EMI LP, SXLP 30187, 1964 and Eduardo Mata.Falla, Manuel de: The Three-Cornered Hat, cond. Eduardo Mata, RCA LP, RL 12387, 1977 Ansermet and Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos, he thought, had conveyed the music's \"earthier qualities\" better than Previn, and Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos was \"more idiomatically Spanish\". The chief virtue of Previn's album was that it was more successful than its predecessors in bringing out \"a chamber-like quality in the detail and precision of the orchestral writing\". The lucidity of Previn's performance reminded Greenfield of \"Stravinsky and Ravel ballets on the one hand [and] neo-classic models on the other\". \"The ear is ravished by the texture\", he wrote. The other salient feature of Previn's reading was his \"characteristic emphasis on rhythmic qualities\". Greenfield was ambivalent about the brief vocal passage at the beginning of the work. Frederica von Stade's voice was \"lovely\", he thought, but it was so prominent in the mix that she seemed to be introducing the ballet as if standing in a spotlight at the front of the stage. On the comparison discs, the soprano soloists sounded further away, providing \"instant evocation of Spanish atmosphere\". In every other respect the album's engineering was exemplary, and certain to delight audiophiles. \"A modern digital recording, even by Philips standards unusually refined and beautifully balanced, brings out beauties in Falla's scoring in this, his masterpiece, that one might not expect\".Gramophone, April 1983, pp. 1151-1152 Costume designs for the ballet's premi\u00e8re in 1919, created by Picasso for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes Greenfield revisited the album in Gramophone in August 1984 to assess how it sounded after being remastered for CD. On this occasion, he compared it with a new Decca release of The Three-Cornered Hat performed by Huguette Tourangeau and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Charles Dutoit.Falla, Manuel de: The Three-Cornered Hat, cond. Charles Dutoit, Decca CD, 410 008-2, 1983 Once again he relished the way in which \"Previn's crisp and rhythmic account of the Falla ballet [brought out its] Stravinskian associations\", but he felt that the sound of the newer recording was preferable to the \"closeness and dryness\" of the old. \"Outstandingly warm and evocative\", Dutoit's disc had \"far more space round the instruments\" than Previn's, yet was no less revealing of inner detail. Philips's forward balancing of von Stade seemed as unfortunate an error of judgment as ever - Tourangeau, like the singers on Ansermet's, Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos's and Mata's recordings, had been recorded as if from a distance, and was \"far more effective\" as a result. It was clear that, all in all, Dutoit's CD was the better of the two.Gramophone, August 1984, p. 218 The album was included in BBC Radio 3's Release on 4 June 1983https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q;=falla+previn+three+cornered+hat&media;=all&yf;=1923&yt;=2009&mf;=1&mt;=12&tf;=00%3A00&tt;=00%3A00, and was also reviewed in The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guideEdward Greenfield, Robert Layton and Ivan March: The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guide, Penguin, 1984, p. 403, The Penguin guide to compact discs, cassettes and LPsEdward Greenfield: The Penguin guide to compact discs, cassettes and LPs, Penguin, 1986, p. 338, Dance and DancersDance and Dancers, 1985, p. 12, FanfareFanfare, Vol. 7, Issues 1-2, 1983, p. 182 and High FidelityHigh Fidelity, Vol. 34, Issues 1-5, p. 75 (where von Stade's contribution was judged disappointingly \"bland\"). ==CD track listing== Manuel de Falla (1876-1946) El sombrero de tres picos (The Three- Cornered Hat) (1919) * 1 (1:15) Introducci\u00f3n (Introduction) Part One * 2 (5:39) La tarde (Afternoon} * 3 (2:27) Danza de la molinera (Fandango) (Dance of the miller's wife) * 4 (0:20) El corregidor (The magistrate) * 5 (0:46) La molinera (The miller's wife) * 6 (4:03) Las uvas (The grapes) Part Two * 7 (3:08) Danza de los vecinos (Seguidillas) (Dance of the neighbours) * 8 (7:57) Danza del molinero (Farucca) (The miller's dance) * 9 (6:59) Danza del corregidor (The magistrate's dance) *10 (6:38) Danza finale (Jota) (Final dance} El Amor Brujo (Love the Magician) (1915) *11 (3:44) Danza ritual del fuego (Ritual fire dance) ==Personnel== * Frederica von Stade, mezzo-soprano * Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra * Andr\u00e9 Previn (1929-2019), conductor ==Release history== In 1983, Philips released the album on LP (catalogue number 6514 281)Falla, Manuel de: The Three-Cornered Hat, cond.
