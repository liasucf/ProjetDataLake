He shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, for their discoveries of protein molecules that control the division (duplication) of cells. Working in yeast, Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle\u2014the progression through G1. ==Education== Hartwell attended Glendale High School in Glendale, California, and then received his Bachelor of Science from the California Institute of Technology in 1961. In 1964, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1965 to 1968, he worked at the University of California, Irvine as a professor. He moved to the University of Washington in 1968. In a series of experiments from 1970 to 1971, Hartwell discovered the cell division cycle (CDC) genes in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These genes regulate the cell cycle and mutations in the genes are involved in some types of cancer. ==Awards and honors== In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hartwell has received many awards and honors including the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1995. He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1987. In 1996, Hartwell joined the faculty of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and in 1997 became its president and director until he retired in 2010.Luke Timmerman for Xconomy. September 20, 2010 Lee Hartwell, at 70, Tackles Personalized Medicine, Education in Latest Career Phase In 1998 he received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, and the Massry Prize from the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California in 2000. On July 9, 2003, Washington Governor Gary Locke awarded the Medal of Merit, the state's highest honor, to Hartwell. He is also a recipient of the Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction. ==Research== His earliest publications focused on the isolation of temperature sensitive yeast mutants disabled in basic biological processes, including DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. This led to the identification of the CDC (Cell Division Cycle) genes, which function in promoting the progression through cell division, most notably CDC28, which encodes the yeast Cdk kinase. Other significant discoveries include introduction of the concept of cell cycle \"checkpoints\", which delay cell division when cellular insults are generated and also the identification and characterization of the mating signal transduction pathway. ==Other positions== Hartwell is the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Canary Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to developing new technologies for the early detection of cancer. He is also a founding co- chair of the Pacific Health Summit, and a member of its Executive Committee.Pacific Health Summit, About the Summit, 2011 In September 2009, it was announced that Hartwell would join the faculty of Arizona State University as the Virginia G.

Recipients of the award also give a lecture at the biennial Yeast Genetics Meeting. * 2016 \u2013 Susan Gasser, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research * 2014 \u2013 George Church, Harvard Medical School * 2012 \u2013 Stan Fields, University of Washington, Seattle * 2010 \u2013 Randy Schekman, University of California, Berkeley * 2008 \u2013 Mitsuhiro Yanagida, Kyoto University * 2006 \u2013 Kim Nasmyth, Oxford University * 2004 \u2013 Susan Lindquist, Whitehead Institute * 2002 \u2013 Leland Hartwell, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ==References== == External links == * Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:American Nobel laureates Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Hartwell Hartwell Category:University of Washington faculty Category:Arizona State University faculty Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research Category:Massry Prize recipients Category:American scientists ",
