Rivera was the \u201cgreatest influence\u201d in preventing Rizal from falling in love with other women while Rizal was traveling outside the Philippines. Rivera's romantic relationship with Rizal lasted for eight years.Leonor Rivera, tagaloglang.com She was immortalized by Rizal as the character Mar\u00eda Clara in the Spanish-language novel Noli Me Tangere. Her original hometown is in Camiling, Tarlac. ==Description== Born as Leonor Bauson Rivera, a native of Camiling, Tarlac, was the daughter of Antonio Rivera and Silvestra Bauzon. Her father (whom Rizal calls \"Uncle Antonio\" in his letters) is a cousin of Rizal's father, Francisco Mercado. Austin Coates, Rizal's European biographer, described Rivera in Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr as a \u201cpretty woman\u201d whose physical features included having a \u201chigh forehead\u201d, \u201csoft and wavy hair\u201d, a face that sported \u201calmond eyes\u201d, \u201csmall and pensive mouth\u201d, and \u201cengaging dimples\u201d. Furthermore, Rivera was a talented, mature, and intelligent lady who played the piano and was gifted with a \u201ccharming singing voice\u201d. Rivera studied at La Concordia College in Manila. ==Family background== Rivera's family resided in Dagupan City from 1890 to 1891, when the railroad line between Manila and Dagupan was being constructed. Her parents had a clothing merchandise business there. The Riveras first lived on Torres Bugallon Avenue in a property belonging to Don Alejandro Venteres and Do\u00f1a Rosario Laurel Villamil, a couple closely connected to the family. The family later moved to a house belonging to Don Andres Palaganas, a person related to Don Venteres by affinity. The son of Don Palaganas, Ciriaco (a former Dagupan municipal president), was the husband of Don Venteres's relative Paula Venteres. The second residence of the Riveras was located at a place presently known as Rivera Street. ==Relationship with Rizal== A crayon sketch of Leonor Rivera drawn by Jos\u00e9 Rizal. Leonor Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 15 years of age. Their ensuing correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell, and their letters to each other slowly became romantic in nature. The correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept Rizal focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera's mother did not favour Rizal as a suitor for her daughter. A letter from Mariano Catigbac dated June 27, 1884 referred to Rivera as Rizal's \u201cbetrothed\u201d. Catigbac described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal's departure, frequently sick because of insomnia. When Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera was no longer living in Intramuros because she and her family had moved back to Dagupan, Pangasinan. Rizal wanted to meet Rivera and vice versa, but both were prohibited by their respective fathers; Francisco Mercado barred his son from meeting her in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger, as Rizal had by then been labeled a filibustero or subversive by the Spanish colonial government because of his novel, Noli Me Tangere. Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of her uncomplaining fidelity, so they asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, even as he kept sending letters to her. The reason for Rivera's silence was the connivance between Rivera's mother and an Englishman named Henry Charles Kipping, a railway engineer who fell in love with Rivera and was favoured by Rivera's mother.Leonor Rivera, Jose Rizal University, joserizal.ph ==Marriage to Kipping== Rivera met Kipping at the house of Do\u00f1a Carmen Villamil, who was a former classmate of hers at La Concordia College. Kipping was associated with the engineer Crisostomo Villamil, who supervised the Manila-Dagupan railroad line project at the time.No. 26: Leonor Rivera, dagupan.com Rivera and Kipping were married on June 17, 1890 in Dagupan. Their first childSome sources say that Carlos Sr. was their only child. See, e.g., Frank Charles Laubach Rizal: Man and Martyr (1936), Ch. 14 was Carlos Rivera Kipping Sr., who married Lourdes R\u00f3mulo. ==Death== Rivera died on 28 August 1893 shortly after giving birth to her second child with Kipping. Shortly before she died, her last wish was to have the silver box containing the ashes of Rizal's burned letters be buried with her. ==Media portrayals== * Portrayed by Mickey Ferriols in the film, Jose Rizal (1998). * Portrayed by Kylie Padilla in the TV series, Ilustrado (2014). ==See also== *Josephine Bracken ==References== ==External links== *Sketch of Leonor Rivera by Jos\u00e9 Rizal and Leonor Rivera\u2019s photograph at tagaloglang.com *Leonor Rivera-Kipping House at Camiling, Tarlac, Philippines at flickr.com Category:1867 births Category:1893 deaths Category:People from Tarlac Category:People from Dagupan Category:19th-century women ",
