The artists used formerly banned western style, from post-impressionism to abstract expressionism to challenge both aesthetic convention and political authority. Their exhibition was closed by the police and they posted a notice on Democracy Wall. In November, the group held their first formal exhibition, Star Art Exhibition, at Beihai Park, Beijing. The exhibition included 163 works by 23 nonprofessional artists. Star Art exhibition was a milestone in China's contemporary art. ==References== == External links == *Introduction of Star Art Exhibition in China Category:Art exhibitions in China Category:Ai Weiwei ",
