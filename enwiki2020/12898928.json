    "text": "Henry Gaylon Matthew Webb (born May 21, 1950) is a former pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1972 to 1977 for the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. Webb was the losing pitcher in the longest game played to a decision in National League history. On September 11, 1974, Webb pitched the 25th inning of the Mets' loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Webb was charged with the only error of his major league career when his wild pickoff throw allowed Bake McBride to score all the way from first base to give St. Louis the victory. It was the first decision of Webb's major league career. Webb pitched a seven inning, 1\u20130 no hit victory for the Tidewater Tides of the International League on June 7, 1974. He is the father of three sons, Kevin, Kyle and former Major League pitcher Ryan Webb. ==References== ==External links== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:New York Mets players Category:Miami Amigos players Category:Marion Mets players Category:Pompano Beach Mets players Category:Memphis Blues players Category:Visalia Mets players Category:Tidewater Tides players Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:People from Copiague, New York ",
