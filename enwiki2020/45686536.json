The service distributes digital set-top boxes with freemium and free-to-view digital TV channels, Broadcast Markup Language, Emergency Warning Broadcast system, and pay per view services to selected areas in the Philippines. In order to avail the service, users must buy an ABS-CBN TVplus set-top box and activate it through ABS-CBNmobile SIM card; activation requirements for the digital channels through other mobile networks later became available around the second quarter of 2018. As of February 2020, ABS-CBN TVplus has sold over 9 million units of its set-top boxes. ==History== ABS-CBN Corporation initially applied for a license from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to operate a digital terrestrial television service in the country back in 2007. ABS-CBN planned to utilize multiplex to offer ABS-CBN, the defunct Studio 23 (now S+A), and 5 additional specialty TV channels. The conglomerate is expecting to spend around \u20b11 billion annually for the next five years for their DTT transition. ABS-CBN utilized UHF channel 51 Manila (695.143 MHz), later UHF Channel 43 (647.143 MHz), for test broadcasts in the DVB-T format. ABS-CBN was expected to begin digital test broadcasts In January 2009. In 2010, the NTC announced that it would formally adopt the Japanese standard ISDB-T for digital broadcasting and issued a circular for ordering the entire country's television networks to switch-off their analog services on December 31, 2015 at 11:59 p.m. Philippine Standard Time (UTC+8). Due to continuous delay of release of the implementing rules and regulations for digital television broadcast, the target date was moved to 2023.Philippine shift to digital TV seen by 2020 retrieved January 20, 2015 In April 2011, ABS-CBN announced further details about its DTT plans, which will offer ABS- CBN and Studio 23 (now S+A). Five new channels will be exclusively available to its digital users which will be offered once the digital broadcast starts. The specialty TV channel line-up includes one news channel, two youth-oriented channels, an educational channel, and a movie channel. ABS-CBN is also planning to utilize the 1seg (one segment) broadcast standard for handheld devices. The set-top box, then known as TV+, was previewed on ABS-CBN's morning show Umagang Kay Ganda on March 22, 2012 where they offered free samples to their studio audiences.ABS-CBN gives name to DTV Digibox called TV+, gives each studio audience a try retrieved March 23, 2012 Since then until its official launch, TV+ was distributed as a prize for the quiz segment of DZMM's \"Failon Ngayon sa DZMM\" and \"Ang Mahiwagang Blackbox\" (The Magical Blackbox). On December 18, 2014, the NTC issued the implementing rules and regulations for digital terrestrial television broadcast in the country.All systems go for digital TV retrieved December 19, 2014 ABS-CBN Corporation officially launched ABS-CBN TVplus on February 11, 2015 through a ceremonial switch-on at the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. In July 2015, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) signed a memorandum of agreement with ABS- CBN for the inclusion of the Emergency Warning Broadcast system (EWBS) in ABS- CBN TVplus. The feature was activated during the Metro Manila Wide Shake Drill held on July 30 through an over-the-air update. In March 2016, in celebration of its first anniversary, a redesigned version of the set-top box was released, with a new processor and support for HDMI and HDTV resolutions; the latter feature was later removed when the price of TVplus was reduced on the fourth quarter of 2016. In May 2016, TVplus was awarded two bronze Stevies for \"Best in New Product Innovation\" and \"Best in Branded Development\" in the 2016 Asia Pacific Stevie Awards. Recently, TVplus updated ABS-CBN's main channel by putting their Regional Network feed in provinces that has their audiences. On July 30, 2018, ABS-CBN TVplus conducted free trial of the new set of freemium channels using UHF Channel 16 (485.143 MHz). It includes cable channels from sister company Creative Programs: O Shopping (also aired as overnight programming for ABS-CBN), Jeepney TV, and Myx (which previously has a complimentary channel Myx2 before TVplus launched in 2015). Also included in the lineup are two new exclusive digital channels, Asianovela Channel and Movie Central. Initially, the five new channels will be beamed from Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Cagayan de Oro, with plans to extend its coverage to existing ABS-CBN DTV stations.ABS-CBN TVplus Go TVC On November 10, 2018, ABS- CBN TVplus launched its digital service in Batangas, making its 16th signal coverage area. On June 1, 2019, ABS-CBN launched a digital TV dongle called ABS-CBN TVplus Go for Android smartphones. It was initially available in Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Benguet, Tarlac, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, Iloilo, Bacolod, Metro Cebu, Cagayan de Oro and Metro Davao. On May 5, 2020, ABS-CBN TVplus was affected by the cease-and-desist order (CDO) issued by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and Solicitor General Jose Calida due to the expiration of ABS-CBN's franchise. ABS-CBN's main channel and S+A ceased broadcasting, as well as the regional digital stations operated by ABS-CBN. Some TVplus channels resumed broadcasting on May 8, but in a limited coverage (Metro Manila, Laguna province, Iloilo province, and selected areas of Baguio) through a blocktime agreement with an unnamed third-party broadcast company. On June 1, 2020, Jeepney TV and Asianovela Channel resumed broadcasting and took over the channel spaces of ABS-CBN and S+A respectively. On June 30, 2020, all the digital channels of ABS-CBN TVplus were forced to stop operations due to the alias cease-and-desist order (ACDO) issued by the National Telecommunications Commission. Yey! and Asianovela Channel stopped broadcasting, while Cine Mo!, TeleRadyo, Jeepney TV and KBO are still available on Sky Cable and other cable providers. However, digital broadcasts of other networks such as TV5 and GMA Network remained on-air on TVplus. During the same Congressional hearing, ABS- CBN Corporation confirmed that they have stopped selling TVplus boxes in February 2020 after their subsidiary and TVplus' parent, ABS-CBN Convergence failed to secure a separate legislative franchise during that same month. ==Offered services== * ABS-CBN TVplus \u2013 An original and flagship product, also called Ang Mahiwagang Black Box, an encrypted digital television converter box that can be used on both house and vehicle use. * ABS-CBN TVplus Internet \u2013 A variation of ABS-CBN TVplus that includes an internet dongle stick that connects the TV to the internet via prepaid plans of its selected provider ABS-CBNmobile.
