    "text": "\u00cdsleifs \u00fe\u00e1ttr biskups (The Tale of Bishop \u00cdsleifr) is a short Old Norse- Icelandic narrative which recounts two episodes from the life of \u00cdsleifr Gizurason, the first bishop of Iceland. The first episode recounts \u00cdsleifr's meeting with St \u00d3lafr in Norway. \u00cdsleifr is introduced to \u00d3lafr by Brandr Vermundarson, who gives \u00cdsleifr a cloak previously gifted to him by the king. The second part of the narrative gives an account of \u00cdsleifr's marriage to Dalla \u00deorvaldsd\u00f3ttir. The \u00fe\u00e1ttr is preserved in Flateyjarb\u00f3k, where it is interpolated in \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga, in AM 753 fol. no. 5, a now fragmentary 15th century vellum manuscript, and AM 554h \u03b1 4to., a 17th century paper copy of AM 753 fol. no. 5. == Bibliography == === Manuscripts === * GkS 1005 fol.
