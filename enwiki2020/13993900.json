His controversial pieces have been featured in shows, galleries, museums and public art installations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Mexico. Baron creates anthropomorphic creatures from bronze and cast stone. He calls these whimsical fantastic icons \"Gods for Future Religions.\" ==Biography== Born in Chicago in 1941 and raised in El Paso on the Mexican border, Baron earned a BA and MA in English, writing his Master's thesis on Joyce Cary's concept of the \"artist as child,\" a guiding theme he still abides by. While serving in the Peace Corps in Nigeria and Ethiopia, he became intrigued with primitive, intuitive African art. Baron later lived in New York City, Philadelphia, Austin, and the Virgin Islands. In 1970, he settled in Antwerp, Belgium, working as the photographer for the art collective Ercola (Experimental Research Center of Liberal Arts) which published the underground comic Spruit.Baron, Richard. \"Profile: Ho Baron.\" Newspaper Tree 14 Nov. 2004.

In the late 1970s, Baron returned to the United States and studied sculpture, first at the Philadelphia College of Art and later at the University of Texas, El Paso, though he is largely self-taught and his expression is intuitive. He earned a second Master's degree in library science, and after a stint in retail, he worked part-time as a college librarian allowing him free time for his creative endeavors.Baron, Richard. \"Profile: Ho Baron.\" Newspaper Tree 14 Nov. 2004. Web. 30 April 2009. A long-time proponent of the arts, he served on the City of El Paso Public Art Committee 2006-2007 and on the board of the Texas Society of Sculptors 2011\u20132015. Baron began his personal expression in the media of writing then progressed to the visual arts: photography, pen and ink drawing, painting and finally sculpture. He occasionally published a satirical political newspaper, The El Paso Lampoon. Baron has had photo exhibits and published a book of photos entitled El Paso: A Hoverview: 59 works. He was creator and D.J. of an electronic music radio program for ten years on N.P.R. In 2007, he began creating short videos of his sculpture.

Baron began sculpting in 1979 and eventually created more than 300 narrative bronze and cast stone figures. Baron's theme is of the human form and he abstracts it with unique motifs of surreal imagery. His sculptures seemed to have \"emerged from both the deepest levels of the ocean and the deepest levels of the subconscious.\"Walker, Jesse. \"Visions of Water: Outsider Art and H2O.\" reasononline 5 Oct 2004. Web. 24 April 2009.
