In 1984, the Preparatory Studies Department (PSD) was established to allow students to cope with the requirements in subsequent degree-oriented courses in regular undergraduate colleges.DLSU-College of Saint Benilde Interactive. Development and Communications Office. 2003 In 1985, the college was renamed the Community College. In May 1987, the PSD was phased out and replaced by the Arts and Business Studies Area (ABSA). The ABSA offered two courses: a Bachelor of Arts degree in Management with emphasis on Human Resources Management and a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration, major in Computer Applications. ===Under De La Salle University (1988\u20131994)=== The Community College was officially renamed De La Salle University-College of Saint Benilde in 1988, after the establishment of the De La Salle University System. Saint B\u00e9nilde Roman\u00e7on was selected as the namesake to symbolize its objective of providing innovative education for the verbally but not numerically gifted, late bloomers, handicapped, as well as artists. B\u00e9nilde made room for his students in Clermont-Ferrand, regardless of their age or their mental capabilities. He also learnt sign language to instruct a deaf-mute boy for his first Holy Communion.CSB'S Original Vision, excerpts from the paper of Br. Andrew Gonzalez FSC. DLSU-CSB Newsletter. August 10, 1992 The ABSA was renamed as the Arts and Business Studies Department (ABSD) and became the day program of the college, while the Career Development Department (CDD) remained as the college's evening program. Because of the need for more space, the college moved to its own campus at 2544 Taft Avenue in 1989. A third major program, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, was offered, undertaken in consortium with the College of Liberal Arts. In 1991, the college offered certificate programs in Accounting and Bookkeeping for the deaf, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Design. ===As an autonomous college (1994\u20132005)=== {| style=\"float:right; margin:1em; width:19em; border:1px solid #a0a0a0; padding:3px; bg-color=yellow; text-align:right;\" |- style=\"background:#060; text-align:center;\" |Presidents of De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde |- style=\"text-align:center; font- size:x-small;\" |Under De La Salle University-Manila |- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-small;\" |\u2022 Br.

The Taft Campus is a block from De La Salle University beside St. Scholastica's College and the LRT-1 Vito Cruz Station. The college is surrounded by dormitories, condominiums, and restaurants. To travel between campuses, students may either walk or ride cycle rickshaws stationed near the campuses or the electric jeepney shuttle service provided by the college. Other properties include the Blessed Hilario Hall on Dominga Street which functions as the college's retreat house. Beside it is the Blessed Scubilion Hall, a residence for student athletes. The Solomon Guest House on C. Ayala Street is a restaurant and meeting area used as a hands-on workplace for selected SHRIM students where they handle the operation of the establishment. In 2018, Benilde Antipolo opened its new building in the Antipolo city proper. The campus is the new home of the tertiary programs from La Salle College Antipolo. The school offers a bachelors degree in Marketing Management, Accountancy, Hospitality Management, Tourism Management, Psychology, Communication Arts, and Education.https://www.benilde.edu.ph/antipolo.html ===Taft Campus=== The Taft Campus stands on a 6,380-square-meter lot that stretches from Taft Avenue to the next parallel street, Leon Guinto. The land was acquired from LBP Leasing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Land Bank of the Philippines. The campus is a square lot made up of four interconnected buildings: the St. Benilde Hall, Duerr Hall, Blessed Solomon Hall, and the St. Mutien Marie Hall. The Duerr Hall has a different alignment with the rest of the buildings, requiring the need for stairs and a ramp on its intersections with the Blessed Solomon Hall. The Plaza Villarosa, named after architect Rogelio Villarosa, is on this campus' second level. It is decorated by lush plants and palm trees and has a basketball court, an elevated platform, and several caba\u00f1as with stone benches. The plaza is used as a study area and venue for events and activities such as those of the student organizations. Bazaars and food establishments also temporarily set up stalls in the plaza during such events. The statue of Saint Benilde, originally located on the campus's old front gate, was moved to the plaza after its completion. Behind the statue is an 18-bell carillon, built as a memorial to the Lasallian brothers who were massacred in De La Salle College during World War II. The names of the brothers are inscribed on the bells of the carillon. The carillon and the statue, when taken together, stand as the visual representation of the college.Fresh Perspective.

June 20, 2005 Calma relates that the building will feature louvers which, when illuminated at night, will appear like lanterns and considering the location, the lighting effects would set the building apart from its surroundings. The opening date of the building was moved to September 2006 when the January 2006 opening could not be achieved, but due to construction delays again, a September opening was not possible and the administration opted for a May 2007 opening instead.SDA Building Update. Br. Edmundo Fernandez FSC. October 2006 The building was delayed due to the intricacy of the architectural design, implementation of the complicated plans, and other problems encountered with the Project Manager and the Contractor. The architectural plans presented design issues which made them difficult to implement at a steady rate. The construction management encountered conflicts in approach and principles with the onsite technical team. Construction however, gained a steady pace after October 2006 and the building was completed and inaugurated in April 2007. The building has four floors of above-level parking space and ten floors of workspace served by two service and five passenger elevators and five sets of stairs. It features a Building Management System with intelligent controls for air conditioning; smoke detection and fire alarms; CCTV surveillance security systems; and has its own sewage management plant. The building is also fully Wi-Fi enabled and the first building in the Philippines to be equipped with 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Among its notable facilities are a three-storey, 558-seat theater which is cantilevered four storeys above the ground and the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, a contemporary art museum which was envisioned to be the first of its kind in the Philippines. Inside, its corridors can double as exhibition spaces. Every classroom is air-conditioned and configured for better acoustics. The building also has a cafeteria, a chapel, and a two-floor library in addition to lecture, computer, and seminar rooms. There are also video, animation, and sound production laboratories as well as a photography studio and a greenscreen TV and film production studio with motion capture equipment, and a 105-seat cinema. ==Academics== Taft Campus The college uses Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, where each person is said to possess varying levels of the different intelligences which determine his or her cognitive profile.

It provides the students a strong foundation in the languages, social and natural sciences, theology and philosophy. Until 2020, it offered the Bachelor of Arts in Consular and Diplomatic Affairs (CDA) degree to develop practitioners in international relations. In January 2020, SDG Dean Gary Ador Dionisio announced that the CDA degree would be replaced with the Bachelor of Arts in Diplomacy and International Affairs (AB-DIA) degree, while a new program entitled the Bachelor of Arts in Governance and Public Affairs (AB-GPA) would be offered, starting August that year. The Consular and Diplomatic Affairs program has networked with various government (e.g. Department of Foreign Affairs, international and Philippine embassies and consulates abroad) and non-government organizations to provide the relevant exposure to students as well as to provide job opportunities to graduates. Consular and Diplomatic Affairs program has entered into agreements with non-profit institutions like Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Manille and Instituto Cervantes de Manila to provide the needed foreign language learning and cultural exposures to students. Most of the professors in the CDA program were former diplomats, namely Rosario Manalo (former Philippine ambassador to Belgium, Sweden, France, and Special Envoy of the Philippines to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights), Minerva Jean Falcon (former Philippine Consul General to Toronto, former Philippine Ambassador to Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany), Antonio Rodriguez (former DFA Undersecretary, former Philippine Ambassador to Thailand), Franklin Ebdalin (former DFA Undersecretary and Philippine ambassador to Hungary), Jos\u00e9 del Rosario Jr. (former Philippine ambassador to India and Jordan), Monina Estrella Callangan- Rueca (former Philippine ambassador to Hungary), Luz Palacios (former DFA Assistant Secretary for European Affairs), and Marilyn Alarilla (former Philippine ambassador to Laos and Turkey). Linkages were also created with different international institutions handling the Model United Nations Assembly (MUNA) abroad (e.g. MUNA USA, China, Switzerland, Germany, Hong Kong, Czech Republic, France, and Canada). Through this, students are able to attend the MUNA as official delegates representing assigned countries. ===School of Professional and Continuing Education=== The School of Professional and Continuing Education (SPaCE) provides post-baccalaureate diploma programs for graduates seeking continuing education in various business-related fields.
