It attracts tourists interested in observing colonial architecture in Peru. Located on La Merced street, the house looks much the same as other manorial houses of those times. It has ample patios, arched ceilings, doors and windows in typical colonial baroque style as well as a balcony. In the eighteenth century the building was acquired by the Goyeneche family from northern Spain. The fa\u00e7ade shows the shield of Jose Sebastian de Goyeneche, bishop of Arequipa and later archbishop of Lima.
