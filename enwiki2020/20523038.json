In the latter years of his life, a disagreement with a junior council caused severe comments regarding his conduct to be made by the Lord Chief Justice of England. He was a member of the Savage Club and his recreations included motoring and golf. He lived in Crowborough, Sussex and Bromley, Kent. Emden's son was Alfred Brotherston Emden, the well known Principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Judge Emden died on 18 February 1911. ==Selected bibliography== * Emden, A.C.R.
