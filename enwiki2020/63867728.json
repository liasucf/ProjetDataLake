    "text": "The Federation of Employees and Managers (, FEC) is a trade union representing white-collar workers in France. The federation was established on 13 July 1893 as the National Federation of Employees, and was a founding element of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) in 1895. It lost some members when the United General Confederation of Labour split away from the CGT, but they rejoined in 1935. Under the leadership of Oreste Capocci, the union opposed the Vichy government, and was banned, but continued to organise illegally and was reconstituted on the liberation of France. In 1947, it voted to leave the CGT, objecting to the influence of the French Communist Party, and it became a founding element of Workers' Force. By 1995, the union had 36,500 members. As of 2020, it has 11 sections: * Agricultural Organisations * Casinos and Gaming * Clerks and Notaries * Commerce * Credit * Insurance * Miscellaneous * Press, Publishing and Advertising * Services * Shipping Companies * Social Organisations ==General Secretaries== :1893: Andr\u00e9 G\u00e9ly :1894: Coulon :1895: Victor Dalle :1896: Sapience :1897: Arthur Rozier :1909: Paul Aubriot :1919: L\u00e9opold Faure :1920: Georges Buisson :1929: Oreste Capocci :1950: Adolphe Sidro :1965: Marius All\u00e8gre :1974: Marc Blondel :1980: Andr\u00e9 Montagne :1984: Yves Simon :1993: Rose Boutaric :2007: Serge Legagnoa :2018: S\u00e9bastien Busiris ==External links== * ==References== Category:Clerical trade unions Category:Trade unions established in 1893 Category:Trade unions in France ",
