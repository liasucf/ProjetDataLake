Following the purchase of Quinta da Prelada by the municipal authority of Porto in the 20th century, the fountain was de-constructed and transferred to the garden of Passeio Alegre located along the mouth of the northern bank of the Douro.

On 12 September 2011, a new proposal was executed by the DRCNorte to classify the group of structures and buildings, that included the fountain. ==Architecture== The fountain is located in the Garden of Passeio Alegre, a large, dense garden/park situated on the northern bank and mouth of the Douro River.
