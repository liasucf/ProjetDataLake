All three stations were opened to the public on 10 December 2019. ==Controversy== The American universities which have established campuses in Education City have been the subject of ongoing criticism of whether it is appropriate to maintain a campus in Qatar, given the alleged Qatari links to state-sponsored terrorism, the lack of freedom of speech in the country, and the country's absolute monarchy. In an interview with Gulf News Journal, Herbert London, president of the London Center for Policy Research and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said \"universities I think have compromised themselves\" by having campuses in a country like Qatar where academic freedom and freedom of the press are severely limited. Along with other universities with campuses in Qatar, Georgetown has received criticism for accepting money from Qatar due to their support of terrorism worldwide and their abysmal human rights record, especially in the lead up to the 2022 World Cup. Some question if universities who profit from campuses in Qatar are thereby complicit in Qatar's alleged sponsorship of terrorism and human rights abuses. ===Academic freedom=== In Qatar, the monarchy has absolute authority over all aspects of life, including its strict adherence to Sharia Law. There are also strict censorship laws that at times have spilled over into Education City, despite the country's stated claims that the institutions there have total academic and intellectual freedom. In 2014, Love Comes Later, a book by Mohanalakshmi Rajakumar, English professor for Georgetown University in Qatar, Northwestern University in Qatar, and Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar, was banned by the State of Qatar with no explanation. Rajakumar has stated that she wrote the book with the Qatari \u201csensibilities of the public culture\u201d in mind, meaning that the book did not include the main three objections: sex, atheism, and politics. Some art that has been displayed at VCUarts Qatar has had to be taken down as some Qatari students found it to be disrespectful to their culture, an issue that reflects the differences in conservatism and social practices that are present at the Qatari campus. In an article by The Washington Post, Susan Dun, an assistant professor of communication at NU-Q said that some professors do exercise caution with statements, written work, or speeches that may reach a wider audience than just the Education City community. Everette Dennis, the dean of NU-Q, led a six-nation survey in 2015 that was financed by the Qatar National Research Fund and asked questions such as if people think their country is \u201cheaded in the right direction\u201d. While the UAE, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia all had answers to the question, there was no data from Qatar as the government blocked the question from being asked to survey participants. ===Freedom of speech=== Students at Northwestern University in Qatar have said that they face challenges due to the lack of freedom of speech rights protecting the media. Students have been harassed and intimidated when trying to capture images that would be considered routine or not offensive in the U.S. Some faculty members maintain that this teaches students persistence and creativity in overcoming obstacles to report on a story. ==Gallery== File:Education City 4 Stevage.jpg File:Entrance to Student Center in Education City.jpg File:Courtyard lawn in Education City Mosque.jpg File:Education City 1 Stevage.jpg File:Education City 3 Stevage.jpg ==References== Category:Education in Qatar Category:Doha ",
