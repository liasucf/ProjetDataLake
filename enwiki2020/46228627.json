    "text": "was a Japanese film producer. He served as the head of production for Toho Studios. He was co-producer of Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also produced many other films, including Yasujir\u014d Ozu's The End of Summer, Kihachi Okamoto's The Sword of Doom and Japan's Longest Day and several films directed by Mikio Naruse. After co-producing The Hidden Fortress, Fujimoto had the task as Toho's head of production of convincing Kurosawa to form his own production company. He had to convince Kurosawa that his own production company would be to his advantage, even though the main reason Toho wanted Kurosawa to form his own production company was to avoid the risk of cost overruns as had happened on The Hidden Fortress. Fujimoto then became a board member of Kurosawa Productions. ==Selected filmography== *Repast (\u3081\u3057 Meshi), Mikio Naruse, (1951) *Husband and Wife (\u592b\u5a66 F\u00fbfu), Mikio Naruse, (1953) *Mr. Pu (Pu-san), Kon Ichikawa, (1953) *Wife (\u59bb Tsuma), Mikio Naruse, (1953) *Sound of the Mountain (\u5c71\u306e\u97f3 Yama no Oto), Mikio Naruse, (1954) *Late Chrysanthemums (\u6669\u83ca Bangiku), Mikio Naruse, (1954) *Floating Clouds (\u6d6e\u96f2 Ukigumo), Mikio Naruse, (1955) *Sudden Rain (\u9a5f\u96e8 Sh\u016bu), Mikio Naruse, (1956) *A Wife's Heart (\u59bb\u306e\u5fc3 Tsuma no kokoro), Mikio Naruse, (1956) *Flowing (\u6d41\u308c\u308b Nagareru), Mikio Naruse, (1956) *Song for a Bride (\u82b1\u5ac1\u4e09\u91cd\u594f Hanayome sanjuso), Ishir\u014d Honda, (1958) *The Hidden Fortress (\u96a0\u3057\u7826\u306e\u4e09\u60aa\u4eba Kakushi toride no san akunin), Akira Kurosawa, (1958) *A Daughter, a Wife, and a Mother (\u5a18 \u59bb \u6bcd Musume tsuma haha), Mikio Naruse, (1960) *Sir Galahad in Campus (\u5927\u5b66\u306e\u82e5\u5927\u5c06 Daigaku no Wakadaish\u014d), Toshio Sugie, (1961) *The Last War (\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6226\u4e89 Sekai Daisens\u014d), Sh\u016be Matsubayashi, (1961) *The End of Summer (\u5c0f\u65e9\u5ddd\u5bb6\u306e\u79cb Kohayagawa-ke no aki), Yasujir\u014d Ozu, (1961) *A Wanderer's Notebook (\u653e\u6d6a\u8a18 Hourou-ki), Mikio Naruse, (1962) *Ch\u016bshingura (\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535 \u82b1\u306e\u5dfb \u96ea\u306e\u5dfb Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki), Hiroshi Inagaki, (1962) *Yearning (\u4e71\u308c\u308b Midareru), Mikio Naruse, (1964) *Godzilla vs. The Thing (\u30e2\u30b9\u30e9\u5bfe\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9 Mosura tai Gojira), Ishir\u014d Honda, (1964) *The Stranger Within a Woman (\u5973\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u3044\u308b\u4ed6\u4eba Onna no naka ni iru tanin), Mikio Naruse, (1966) *The Sword of Doom (\u5927\u83e9\u85a9\u5ce0 Dai-bosatsu T\u014dge), Kihachi Okamoto, (1966) *Japan's Longest Day (\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u9577\u3044\u65e5 Nihon no ichiban nagai hi), Kihachi Okamoto, (1967) *Goyokin (\u5fa1\u7528\u91d1 Goy\u014dkin), Hideo Gosha, (1969) *The Scandalous Adventures of Buraikan (\u7121\u983c\u6f22 Buraikan), Masahiro Shinoda, (1970) *To Love Again (\u611b\u3075\u305f\u305f\u3073 Ai futatabi), Kon Ichikawa, (1971) *Battle of Okinawa (\u6fc0\u52d5\u306e\u662d\u548c\u53f2 \u6c96\u7e04\u6c7a\u6226 Gekid\u014d no Sh\u014dwashi: Okinawa Kessen), Kihachi Okamoto, (1971) *The Wolves (Shussho Iwai), Hideo Gosha, (1971) *The Gate of Youth (\u9752\u6625\u306e\u9580 Seishun no mon), Kirir\u014d Urayama, (1975) ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Yamaguchi (city) Category:Japanese film producers ",
