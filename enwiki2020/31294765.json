    "text": "Less (Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as LESS) is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client side or server side.Official Less website Official Less website Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer \"SCSS\" syntax of Sass, which adapted its CSS-like block formatting syntax.Sass and Less Sass and Less Less is open source. Its first version was written in Ruby; however, in the later versions, use of Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The indented syntax of Less is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less code with the same semantics. Less provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that Less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser. == Features == === Variables === Less allows variables to be defined. Variables in Less are defined with an at sign (@). Variable assignment is done with a colon (:). During translation, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document. @pale-green-color: #4D926F; #header { color: @pale-green-color; } h2 { color: @pale-green-color; } The code above in Less would compile to the following CSS code. #header { color: #4D926F; } h2 { color: #4D926F; } === Mixins === Mixins allow embedding all the properties of a class into another class by including the class name as one of its properties, thus behaving as a sort of constant or variable. They can also behave like functions, and take arguments. CSS does not support Mixins: Any repeated code must be repeated in each location. Mixins allow for more efficient and clean code repetitions, as well as easier alteration of code. .rounded-corners (@radius: 5px 10px 8px 2px) { -webkit-border-radius: @radius; -moz-border-radius: @radius; border-radius: @radius; } #header { .rounded- corners; } #footer { .rounded-corners(10px 25px 35px 0px); } The above code in Less would compile to the following CSS code: #header { -webkit-border- radius: 5px 10px 8px 2px; -moz-border-radius: 5px 10px 8px 2px; border-radius: 5px 10px 8px 2px; } #footer { -webkit-border-radius: 10px 25px 35px 0px; -moz- border-radius: 10px 25px 35px 0px; border-radius: 10px 25px 35px 0px; } Less has a special type of ruleset called parametric mixins which can be mixed in like classes, but accepts parameters. #header { h1 { font-size: 26px; font- weight: bold; } p { font-size: 16px; a { text-decoration: none; color: red; &:hover { border-width: 1px; color: #fff; } } } } The above code in Less would compile to the following CSS code: #header h1 { font-size: 26px; font- weight: bold; } #header p { font-size: 16px; } #header p a { text-decoration: none; color: red; } #header p a:hover { border-width: 1px; color: #fff; } === Functions and operations === Less allows operations and functions. Operations allow addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of property values and colors, which can be used to create complex relationships between properties. Functions map one-to-one with JavaScript code, allowing manipulation of values. @the-border: 1px; @base-color: #111; @red: #842210; #header { color: @base-color * 3; border-left: @the-border; border-right: @the-border * 3; } #footer { color: @base-color + #003300; border-color: desaturate(@red, 10%); } The above code in Less would compile to the following CSS code: #header { color: #333; border-left: 1px; border-right: 3px; } #footer { color: #114411; border-color: #7d2717; } == Comparison == === Sass === Both Sass and Less are CSS preprocessors, which allow writing clean CSS in a programming construct instead of static rules.What's Wrong With CSS What's Wrong With CSS Less is inspired by Sass.About Less About Sass was designed to both simplify and extend CSS, so things like curly braces were removed from the syntax. Less was designed to be as close to CSS as possible, and as a result existing CSS can be used as valid Less code.Sass/Less Comparison The newer versions of Sass also introduced a CSS-like syntax called SCSS (Sassy CSS). == Use on sites == Less can be applied to sites in a number of ways. One option is to include the less.js JavaScript file to convert the code on-the-fly. The browser then renders the output CSS. Another option is to render the Less code into pure CSS and upload the CSS to a site. With this option no .less files are uploaded and the site does not need the less.js JavaScript converter. == Less software == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Name !! Description !!
