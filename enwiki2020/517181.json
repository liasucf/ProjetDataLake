    "text": "The Legislative Assembly of Quebec (French: Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative du Qu\u00e9bec) was the name of the lower house of Quebec's legislature until December 31, 1968, when it was renamed the National Assembly of Quebec. At the same time, the upper house of the legislature, the Legislative Council, was abolished. Both were initially created by the Constitution Act of 1867. It was the Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand that passed the \"Bill 90\" legislation to abolish the upper house, but earlier attempts had been made by earlier governments. The presiding officer of the Assembly was known in French as \"orateur,\" a literal translation of the English term, \"speaker\". When the Assembly was renamed so too was the title of its presiding officer, becoming known as the President. Today, Quebec has a unicameral legislature, whose single house is the National Assembly. The large chamber that housed the assembly is also known as le salon bleu (the blue hall) because of the predominance of the colour on the walls. It used to be known as le salon vert (the green hall) until 1978, when the colour was changed to suit the televising of parliamentary debates. ==References== Quebec Quebec Category:Defunct lower houses Category:Political history of Quebec fr:Assembl\u00e9e L\u00e9gislative du Qu\u00e9bec ",
