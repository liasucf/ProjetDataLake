It includes a number of singles, album tracks, b-sides and a demo of \"Platinum Blonde\" which previously appeared on the 1994 compilation album The Platinum Collection. The compilation has since been re-released in UK and Europe by EMI under the title The Essential Collection in 1997 and then again in 1999.
