    "text": "Rascal Flatts is the debut studio album by American country music group Rascal Flatts, released on June 6, 2000 on Lyric Street Records. It sold 2,303,000 in the United States up to May 2009, and has been certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. The album produced four singles on the Billboard country charts in \"Prayin' for Daylight\", \"This Everyday Love\", \"While You Loved Me\" and \"I'm Movin' On\", all of which charted in the Top Ten on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. \"Long Slow Beautiful Dance\" (which featured them all on lead vocals) also charted in the lower regions of the charts based on unsolicited airplay. To date, it is the only Rascal Flatts album of their career not to feature a number one single. While the band's contemporaries, Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney, started with a neotraditional country sound, the band had a crossover-friendly country pop sound from the very beginning. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Rascal Flatts=== *Gary LeVox - lead vocals *Jay DeMarcus - background vocals, bass guitar (\"From Time To Time\"), lead vocals on \"Long Slow Beautiful Dance\" *Joe Don Rooney - background vocals, lead vocals on \"Long Slow Beautiful Dance\" ===Additional musicians=== *Tim Akers - keyboards *Larry Beaird - acoustic guitar *Mike Brignardello - bass guitar (all other tracks) *Joe Chemay - bass guitar (\"Long Slow Beautiful Dance\" and \"Prayin' For Daylight\") *Paul Franklin - steel guitar *Dann Huff - electric guitar *George Marinelli, Jr. - electric guitar *Brent Mason - electric guitar *Brian Siewert - keyboards (\"From Time To Time\", \"Long Slow Beautiful Dance\", and Prayin' For Daylight\") *Lonnie Wilson - drums *Jonathan Yudkin - fiddle, mandolin, violin, viola, cello ==Chart performance== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
