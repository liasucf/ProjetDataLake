    "text": "The Borough of Rhuddlan was one of six districts of the county of Clwyd, north-east Wales, from 1974 to 1996. It was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 from part of the administrative county of Flintshire, namely the urban districts of Prestatyn and Rhyl and St Asaph Rural District. The district was named after Rhuddlan Castle, where the Statute of Rhuddlan was issued in 1284. This was illustrated in the borough's coat of arms which showed a castle of the time of Edward I in the shield, and a Welsh dragon grasping a parchment scroll, representing the statute, as the crest. The borough's motto was Rhuddlan Crud Cymru or Rhuddlan, Cradle of Wales. The district was abolished in 1996, with its area forming part of the Denbighshire unitary authority.
