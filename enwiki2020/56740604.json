    "text": "During and up to the Second World War, the naval industry of the Kingdom of Romania produced numerous medium and small size warships, of varying types, as well as auxiliaries. Warships were produced mainly for the Romanian Navy, but later Romanian naval facilities and products also benefited the Kriegsmarine, among others. ==Facilities== The most important Romanian shipyard was at Gala\u021bi, followed by the one at Constan\u021ba and finally the ones at Severin and Br\u0103ila. Gala\u021bi benefited of the country's only dry dock, built in 1937. It also had two floating docks which could lift 200 and 300 tons respectively. The entire facility employed 500\u2013800 people. Constan\u021ba, although lacking a dry dock, had by far the largest floating dock in the country, able to lift up to 8,000 tons. Br\u0103ila also had a floating dock for small craft, which could lift up to 100 tons. Severin had no dry or floating dock, but for much of the interwar it was the only other port in the country besides Gala\u021bi able to produce anything larger than barges, lighters and small river craft. Maximum annual building capacity amounted to 1,500 tons as of 1933. This facility employed 100 people.Rumania Economic Survey, Great Britain. Ministry of Economic Warfare, 1943, p. 28 ==Warships produced for the Romanian Navy== ===Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu-class=== NMS Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu in 1941 In 1907, despite lacking a dry dock, the Romanian shipyard at Gala\u021bi was able to co- build a class of four 700-ton river monitors for the Romanian Danube Flotilla: the Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu class. The four vessels of this class were built in sections at STT in Austria-Hungary, transported to Romania then assembled and launched at Gala\u021bi. Each monitor had an overall armour thickness of 70\u201375 mm. During World War II, all four monitors were fitted for service at sea as anti- submarine escorts, each being armed with three 120 mm naval guns in single armored turrets, one 76 mm naval/AA gun, two 47 mm naval guns and two depth charge throwers (one of 760 mm and the other of 700 mm). The four warships were in service throughout both world wars.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906\u20131921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 422\u0415. \u0415. \u0428\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435, \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442\u044b 1939\u20131940 \u0433\u0433., \u0420\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043b \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a, 2013, pp. 120\u2013121 (in Russian)Roger Kafka, Roy L.

She was laid down at the Gala\u021bi shipyard in 1938 and launched on 4 May 1941. She had a standard (surfaced) displacement of 620 tons, a length of 58 meters, a beam of 5.6 meters and a draught of 3.6 meters. Her power plant consisted of two MAN diesel engines and two electric motors powering two shafts, giving her a top speed of 16 knots on surface and 9 knots in immersion. She was armed with one 105 mm deck gun, one 37 mm anti-aircraft gun and six 533 mm torpedo tubes (four in the bow and two in the stern), her crew amounting to 45.Paul E.

She was also laid down in 1938 and launched on 22 May 1941. She had the same power plant as her sister, with a slightly faster surface top speed of 17 knots, due to her standard (surfaced) displacement of 585 tons (35 tons lighter than her sister). Her submerged top speed was however the same, 9 knots. She was armed with four 533 mm torpedo tubes (all in the bow), one 88 mm deck gun, one 20 mm anti-aircraft gun and could carry up to 40 mines in 10 vertical tubes (5 tubes on each side). Her crew amounted to 40.Paul E.

They were built locally from German materials. These Romanian warships had a standard displacement of 543 tons and a full load displacement of 775 tons. They measured 62 meters in length, with a beam of 8.5 meters and a draught of 2.3 meters. Armament consisted of two 88 mm guns plus one twin 37 mm and three single 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, as well as two depth charge throwers. Two-shaft triple-expansion coal engines generated an output of 2,400 hp resulting in a top speed of 17 knots and a range of just over 1,000 nautical miles at that speed. Each of the four vessels (DB-13, DB-14, DB-15 and DB-16) had a crew of 80. In 1951, their power plants were converted to oil.Frederick Thomas Jane, Jane's Fighting Ships, Sampson Low, Marston and Company, 1974, p. 275 It is possible that, although launched in 1943, none of the ships was actually completed by the end of the war, but in 1953.DEMOCRA\u021aIA minesweepers ===Small warships and auxiliaries=== NMS V\u00e2ntul The Vedenia class was a unique derivation of the British Power Boat MTB. By design, the six vessels of this class represented the Dutch version of the Power boat. They were built under licence at the Gala\u021bi shipyard in Romania, being laid down in 1939 and commissioned in 1943. The six boats, numbered 4 to 9, were named Vedenia, V\u00e2ntul, Vijelia, Viforul, V\u00e2rtejul and Vulcanul. Vijelia and Viforul were named after their Vospers type predecessors, which were sunk in November 1941 by Soviet mines. Each of the six boats was armed with two 20 mm anti-aircraft guns and two 457 mm (18 inch) torpedo tubes. The six boats were in service until at least 1954.Jane's fighting ships: 1953\u20131954, Sampson Low, Marston, 1955, p. 294Cornel I.

Tucker, World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2011, p. 633 As of 1942, the first military vessel known to have been built in Romania was still in use. She was a 10-ton steam launch, used for border patrol. Built at Gala\u021bi in 1900, she measured 14 meters in length, with a beam of 2.40 meters and a draught of 1 meter. Her top speed was of 8 knots with a crew of 5.Marie Maurice Cl\u00e9ment Raoul Testu de Balincourt, P. Vincent-Br\u00e9chignac, Henri Le Masson, Jean Labayle Couhat, M. Bernard Pr\u00e9zelin, Les Flottes de combat en 1942, Challamel, 1942, p. 644 In regard to auxiliary vessels, barges of up to 1,700 tons were built at Gala\u021bi before the war.Rumania Economic Survey, Great Britain. Ministry of Economic Warfare, 1943, p. 28 Two such barges were fitted for coastal defense as floating artillery sections, each barge being armed with two guns: one with 47 mm guns and the other with 152 mm guns.George Cristian Maior, The Danube, European security and cooperation at the beginning of the 21th century, Enciclopedica Pub. House, 2002, p. 65 These two armed barges were towed by two military tugs of over 600 tons each, built at Gala\u021bi in 1941.

The Romanian port of Constan\u021ba was elected as the S-flotilla's headquarters. Transporting the six boats overland from Germany to Romania was an impressive logistical feat. The superstructure and all weapons were removed, leaving only the hull. After a long road journey of 60 hours, the boats arrived at Ingolstadt, where they were transferred back to water and towed towards Linz. Upon reaching the Austrian city, the superstructure was rebuilt, then the journey continued down the Danube to Gala\u021bi, where the main engines were installed. The E-boats then continued on their own power towards Constan\u021ba, where refitting was completed.Lawrence Paterson, Schnellboote: A Complete Operational History, pp. 234\u2013235 Six U-boats of the rather small coastal submarine Type IIB, which at the time served as training vessels in the Baltic Sea, were assigned to the Black Sea theatre. Starting from May 1942, they were partially dismantled in Kiel, to reduce weight and size. Toppled over 90\u00b0, and fitted with additional floating devices, the stripped down hulls, weighing 140 tons, were shipped through the Kiel Canal and on the Elbe up to Dresden-\u00dcbigau, where they were placed on two 70 ton Culemeyer road transportersKenneth G. Wynn: U-boat operations of the second world war, Volume 1, Chatham, 1997, , hauled by Kaelble tractors. The boats then traveled at an average speed of 5 mph over the Reichsautobahn (modern day A4 and A9) to the slipway in Ingolstadt. Traveling down the Danube, one obstacleGerd Enders: Deutsche U-Boote zum Schwarzen Meer 1942\u20131944: eine Reise ohne Wiederkehr, Mittler, 1997, , was the old Stone Bridge of Regensburg with its arches.
