    "text": "The Barbary Coast Trail is a marked trail that connects 20 historic sites and several local history museums in San Francisco, California. Approximately 180 bronze medallions and arrows embedded in the sidewalk mark the 3.8-mile (6.1 km) trail. The historic sites of the Barbary Coast Trail relate primarily to the period from the California Gold Rush of 1849 to the Earthquake and Fire of 1906, a period when San Francisco grew from a small village to an important shipping port. Sites along the trail include the Old Mint, a national historic landmark; Union Square; Maiden Lane; Old St. Mary's Cathedral, first Catholic cathedral West of the Rockies; T'ien Hou temple, one of the oldest still- operating Chinese temples in the United States; Wells Fargo History Museum; Pony Express headquarters site; Jackson Square Historic District, which contains the last cluster of Gold Rush and Barbary Coast-era buildings in San Francisco; Old Ship Saloon, once a shanghaiing den; Coit Tower; Fisherman's Wharf; SF Maritime National Historical Park, which maintains a large collection of historic ships; and Ghirardelli Square. Each end of the Barbary Coast Trail is connected by the Hyde-Powell cable car line, itself a national historic landmark. == History == The Barbary Coast Trail was founded by historian Daniel Bacon in collaboration with the San Francisco Historical Society. The trail was inaugurated in May 1998 and was originally marked with painted images as trail markers. The images were replaced over time with bronze medallions designed by Daniel Bacon and Illustrator, Jim Blair. By the year 2015, approximately 180 medallions had been placed in total. == See also == *Barbary Coast, San Francisco * 49-Mile Scenic Drive * Chinatown * Hallidie Plaza * International Settlement (San Francisco) * Nob Hill * Portsmouth Square * The Embarcadero == References == == External links == * Category:1998 establishments in California Category:Historic trails and roads in California Category:History of San Francisco Category:Landmarks in San Francisco Category:Trails in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Nob Hill, San Francisco Category:Chinatown, San Francisco Category:Russian Hill, San Francisco Category:North Beach, San Francisco Category:Financial District, San Francisco Category:Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco Category:California Gold Rush Category:South of Market, San Francisco Category:Barbary Coast, San Francisco Category:Tourist attractions in San Francisco Category:Gold rush trails and roads ",
