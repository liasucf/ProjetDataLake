The event was held from November 29 to December 1. Squash is an indoor racquet sport which was, until recently, called \"Squash Rackets\", a reference to the 'squashable' soft ball used in the game (compared with the harder ball used in its parent game Racquets or Rackets--see below). The game is played by two players, with 'standard' rackets (or occasionally four players for doubles) in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. ==SUm== ==Medal winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
