    "text": "In mathematics, a remarkable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. A cardinal \u03ba is called remarkable if for all regular cardinals \u03b8 > \u03ba, there exist \u03c0, M, \u03bb, \u03c3, N and \u03c1 such that # \u03c0 : M \u2192 H\u03b8 is an elementary embedding # M is countable and transitive # \u03c0(\u03bb) = \u03ba # \u03c3 : M \u2192 N is an elementary embedding with critical point \u03bb # N is countable and transitive # \u03c1 = M \u2229 Ord is a regular cardinal in N # \u03c3(\u03bb) > \u03c1 # M = H\u03c1N, i.e., M \u2208 N and N \u22a8 \"M is the set of all sets that are hereditarily smaller than \u03c1\" Equivalently, \\kappa is remarkable if and only if for every \\lambda>\\kappa there is \\bar\\lambda<\\kappa such that in some forcing extension V[G], there is an elementary embedding j:V_{\\bar\\lambda}^V\\rightarrow V_\\lambda^V satisfying j(\\operatorname{crit}(j))=\\kappa. Note that, although the definition is similar to one of the definitions of supercompact cardinals, the elementary embedding here only has to exist in V[G], not in V. ==See also== *Hereditarily countable set ==References== * * Category:Large cardinals ",
