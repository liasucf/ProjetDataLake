    "text": "Rutherford H. Adkins \"Lubby\" (1924-1998) was a World War II pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen. He flew fourteen combat missions with the Tuskegee Airmen. He came home to complete his education and earn multiple degrees: he was the first African American to earn a PhD from The Catholic University in Washington D.C. Adkins went on to serve in many positions in higher education including as President of Knoxville College and Fisk University. ==Military service== ===World War II=== The Tuskegee Airmen's aircraft had distinctive markings that led to the name, \"Red Tails.\" Adlkins was drafted into the army while he was attending college at Temple University in 1943. He received flight training at Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University, in Alabama. He was assigned to the 100th Fighter Squadron of the 332nd, and sent to Europe. In Europe he flew 14 combat mission mostly in support of bombing runs. ==Education and Career== Adkins first attended college at Virginia Union University, Richmond, VA and later transferred to Temple University, Philadelphia, PA. He was drafted before completing his degree. After his military service, Adkins returned to earn a Bachelor of Science in Physics from Virginia State University in 1947. He went on to earn a master's degree in physics from Howard University in 1949 and was the first African American to receive a PhD from The Catholic University In Washington D.C. in 1955. Adkins thesis is entitled \"A Theoretical Investigation of Odd-Odd Nuclei.\" Adkins had a long distinguished career in education. He had appointments at Virginia State College, Tennessee State University, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Georgia Institute of Technology. At Fisk University he served as interim president from 1995 to 1996. He then served as the president of Knoxville College from 1976 through 1981. In 1993 Adkins returned to Fisk University as a physic professor and later the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. He was appointed Interim President of Fisk University on July 1, 1996 and on February 14, 1997, was named President. Adkins had an early understanding of the importance of computers for education and research. He was instrumental in acquiring an IBM 370 computer at Fisk University and later became a founding director of the university's computer center. == Research == Adkins research centered on theoretical work in the physics of atomic collisions. His work focused on positronium formation, the onset of avalanches in moist rarefied atmospheres at high energy-to-pressure ratios and energy dissipation in the residual gases of a Z-pinch plasma. He did most of this work during summer appointments at Federal laboratories\u2014namely, NASA's Langley Research Center, the Army's Harry Diamond Laboratory, and the Naval Research Laboratory. ==Personal life== Adkins was married to Nanci Cherry Adkins and together they had two daughters. He went on to serve a long distinguished career in education. In 1997 he was diagnosed with cancer, and he died in 1998. ==See also== * Dogfights (TV series) * Executive Order 9981 * Freeman Field Mutiny * List of Tuskegee Airmen * Military history of African Americans * The Tuskegee Airmen (movie) ==References== ===Notes=== ==External links== *Tuskegee Airmen at Tuskegee University * Tuskegee Airmen Archives at the University of California, Riverside Libraries. * Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. * Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service) * Tuskegee Airmen National Museum * Fly (2009 play about the 332d Fighter Group) * Executive Order 9981 * List of African American Medal of Honor recipients * Military history of African Americans Category:1924 births Category:1998 deaths Category:United States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II Category:People from Alexandria, Virginia Category:Tuskegee Airmen Category:Tuskegee Institute alumni Category:Military personnel from Tuskegee, Alabama Category:People from Virginia Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:Presidents of Fisk University Category:Fisk University faculty Category:African-American academics Category:Howard University alumni Category:Virginia State University alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni ",
