    "text": "The Knockout The Knockout (1914) was Charlie Chaplin's seventeenth film for Keystone Studios. Chaplin only has a small role, and Fatty Arbuckle takes up the main role (it is one of only a few films in which Chaplin's Little Tramp character appears in a secondary role; Chaplin doesn't even appear until the second half of the film). It also stars Arbuckle's wife, Minta Durfee, Edgar Kennedy and Keystone owner, Mack Sennett in a minor role as a spectator. The film was directed by Charles Avery, and made in 1914 in America. ==Plot== Two down-and-out hoboes pretend to be pugilists in order to make some money to eat. One of them claims to be Cyclone Flynn, the boxing champion. In the meantime Pug, a good-hearted local strongman, has fought and defeated several mashers who were bothering his girlfriend. The mashers make up with Pug and propose to enter him to fight the fake Cyclone Flynn at a local theater. Enter the real Cyclone Flynn, who expels the hoboes and takes over the engagement. The fight starts, comically refereed by Chaplin's character. It quickly deteriorates into chaos, after Pug steals a gambler's revolvers and chases the champion from the ring. A long chase sequence involving the boxers, spectators, Pug's girlfriend, and the Keystone Kops follows. ==Review== A reviewer from Moving Picture World wrote, \"Roscoe Arbuckle, ably supported, makes barrels of fun in this two-reel comedy release. In its early stages, the story has a particularly well connected plot, but things go to smash a little in this line when a big chase is introduced in the second reel. This chase, as well as a comedy prize fight, is unusually funny.\" ==Cast== * Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle - Pug * Minta Durfee - Pug's girlfriend * Edgar Kennedy - Cyclone Flynn * Charles Chaplin - Referee * Frank Opperman - Fight promoter * Al St. John - Pug's rival * Hank Mann - Tough * Mack Swain - Gambler ==See also== * Charlie Chaplin filmography * Fatty Arbuckle filmography ==External links== * * * * Category:1914 films Category:1910s sports comedy films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American sports comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American boxing films Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:Keystone Studios films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:1914 comedy films ",
