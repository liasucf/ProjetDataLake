His father was Ordo\u00f1o Berm\u00fadez, an illegitimate son of King Bermudo II of Le\u00f3n, and his mother was Fronilde Pel\u00e1ez, also a member of the high nobility as the daughter of Count Pelayo Rodr\u00edguez and his wife Gotina Fern\u00e1ndez de Cea, daughter of Count Fernando Berm\u00fadez de Cea and sister of Jimena, the mother of King Sancho Garc\u00e9s III the Great, and of Justa Fern\u00e1ndez, married to Count Fla\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz. == Biographical sketch == He was named count between 1059 and 1061 when he appears with the title in several family transactions and royal charters, such as one dated 1061 at the Monastery of Samos when he confirms as Sanctius proles Ordonii comes (Sancho, son of Ordo\u00f1o, count). Count Sancho was a member of the Curia regis of his cousins King Fernando I and Sancha of Le\u00f3n and in 1059 confirmed a private transaction between these monarchs and Fronilde Ov\u00e9quiz.Sancho Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez was a first cousin of Queen Sancha, both of them grandchildren of King Bermudo II, and a second cousin of King Fernando I, both being descendants of Urraca Fern\u00e1ndez, a daughter of Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, count of Castile. He also appears in charters issued by King Alfonso VI, including one dated 1071 when he confirms as Sancio Ordoniz comes a donation made by the king to Velasco Vela, and in 1073 at the Monastery of Samos when the king named him one of the judges entrusted with settling a dispute between the abbot of the monastery and Ero Pel\u00e1ez.
