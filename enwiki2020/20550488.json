    "text": "Radiance is a double-album by American pianist Keith Jarrett recorded in 2002 in Japan at two different concerts: Osaka (October 27) and Tokyo (October 30). It was released by ECM Records in 2005. After dismissing the idea of performing lengthy improvised solos (see A Multitude of Angels), Radiance marked a new beginning in Jarrett's approach to solo piano concerts and this would be assessed in future solo recordings. According to keithjarrett.org, the documented 2002 Osaka and Tokyo concerts were only his third and fourth solo performances since temporarily retiring due to chronic fatigue syndrome; the other two had taken place in Tokyo in September 1999. keithjarrett.org Keith Jarrett past concerts 2002 accessed May 2020 == Original notes == On the double-CD original notes, \"Some Words About The Music\", Keith Jarrett states that: ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4.5 stars, stating, \"His process is immediate, poignant, and utterly engaging throughout and marks a new phase in his solo recordings that will spur great interest in any open-minded listener interested in improvisational music.\".Jurek, T.
