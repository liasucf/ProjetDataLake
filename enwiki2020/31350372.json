In this visual music short, Hinton animates to an original modern classical composition by Montreal-based composer Michael Oesterle. Influenced by Futurism and Abstract expressionism, the film was computer animated and represented a departure for Hinton, who generally used traditional animation techniques. ==References== ==External links== * Watch cNote at NFB.ca * Category:2005 short films Category:Canadian films Category:National Film Board of Canada animated short films Category:Films without speech Category:Visual music Category:Abstract animation Category:Quebec films Category:Computer-animated short films Category:Films directed by Christopher Hinton Category:Best Animated Short Film Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners Category:2005 animated films Category:2005 films Category:2000s animated short films Category:Animated musical films Category:Canadian animated short films Category:Canadian musical films Category:2000s musical films ",
