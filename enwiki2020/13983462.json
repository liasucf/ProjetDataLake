Cliff Madras was the star. ==Events== Bombay continued its dominance of Indian domestic cricket with only Karnataka and Delhi able to mount any kind of challenge during this period. India enjoyed two international highlights. In 1971, they won a Test series in England for the first time ever, surprisingly defeating Ray Illingworth's Ashes winners. In 1983, again in England, India were surprise winners of the 1983 Cricket World Cup. ==Domestic cricket== ===Ranji Trophy winners=== * 1970\u201371 \u2013 Bombay * 1971\u201372 \u2013 Bombay *
