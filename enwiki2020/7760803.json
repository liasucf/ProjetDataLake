The organization adopted its new name in October 2006 to reflect an expanded mandate. In 1998, the Software Human Resources Council was implicated in the controversial Software Development Worker Pilot Project, a program that allowed the Canadian Department of Citizenship and Immigration to fast-track the visa applications of foreign workers. The story was covered in a paper by Dr. Alasdair Roberts titled \"Making Policy Behind Closed Doors\", which criticized the Department of Human Resources Development Canada for allegedly handling this project in such a way as to allow for fast-tracking of visa applications. The paper argued that the Canadian government handed decision-making to Software Human Resources Council and the Information and Communications Technology Council.https://groups.google.com/group/can.org.cips/msg/ee32d7defe19a182 Making Policy Behind Closed Doors Toronto Globe and Mail, 27 July 1998, page A11 by: Dr. Alasdair Roberts According to a 2003 story by Juliet O'Neill in The Ottawa Citizen, the Canadian federal government gave $1.1-million to the Software Human Resources Council for the development and dissemination of the Information Technology-industry labour market information.
