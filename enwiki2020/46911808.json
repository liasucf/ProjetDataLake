Kale is a specialist in British and imperial history. She has been a critic of some historians of the empire who, in her view, have relied on biased sources to perpetuate a privileged perspective on imperial British history, such as those who wrote The Oxford History of the British Empire who she described as engaging in \"a disturbingly revisionist project that seeks to neutralize ... the massive political and military brutality and repression\" of the empire.\"Reviews\", Madhavi Kale, Social History, Vol. 27, No. 2 (May, 2002), pp. 250-253. ==Selected publications== *\"The Negro and Dark Princess: Two Legacies of the Universal Races Congress (London, 1911)\" in Radical History Review, 92 (spring): pp. 133\u2013152.
