He took a leading role in revolutionising social housing in order the address the overcrowding housing condition. He applied his own design in Wah Fu Estate, the \"Twin Tower Block\": like Scottish \"Z-plan\" castles, these each comprised two juxtaposed towers of a hollow, internally galleried plan. The second design innovation was an adaptation of the comprehensive land-use planning of the English New Towns.

He proposed the Home Ownership Scheme, which allowed those who lived in rented public housing to buy their own flats.
