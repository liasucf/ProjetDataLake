    "text": "East Coast Basketball League (ECBL) is a men's professional basketball minor league in the United States that began play in March 2015. The league is centered in the Carolinas with teams also in Georgia and Virginia. Five of the teams (Carolina Gladiators, Fayetteville Crossover, PrimeTime Players, Queen City Express, South Carolina All-Stars) in the ECBL previously played in the Tobacco Road Basketball League. The teams broke away from the TRBL due to changes in the league format. The ECBL will broadcast games live and delayed online via Chris Schieman Media & Marketing. == History == On August 16, 2014 the ECBL announced the addition of the Fort Gordon Eagles. A military team, the Eagles also compete in the Southeast Military Athletics Conference (SEMAC) from October to February. Former American Basketball Association team Savannah Storm were named the 11th franchise to enter the ECBL. The first-ever ECBL Championship was won by PrimeTime Players, 130-113 over the Fayetteville Crossover. The final was played on June 27, 2015 in Fort Mill, South Carolina and streamed live online. Former Catawba College forward Donald Rutherford scored 34 points while grabbing 16 rebounds for PrimeTime and was named game MVP. Four new teams joined the ECBL for the 2016 season: expansion teams Carolina MPact, Petersburg Revolution, RDU Raptors and Winston-Salem Certified (formerly of the TRBL). Expansion into Charlotte was announced on April 8, 2016 with the addition of Charlotte Golden Bulls. At the August AGM, league board of directors unanimously accepted the expansion application of the Florence Wildcats for 2017. Two teams also announced name changes: Peterburg Cavaliers (formerly Revolution) and North Carolina Coyotes (formerly RDU Raptors). League owners approved the expansion application of the Carolina Thunder for 2017. The Thunder began as a travel team playing a league schedule on the road. A second travel team, Hickory Hoyas, were added to the schedule before the season opener. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:65%; text-align:left\" !Mid-Atlantic Conference !City !Arena !Founded !First ECBL season |- |Binghamton Bulldogs |Binghamton, New York | |2017 |2021 |- |Fredericksburg Grizzlies |Fredericksburg, Virginia | |2016 |2021 |- |Hub City Hogs |Hagerstown, Maryland | |2019 |2021 |- |Philly Cannons |Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | |2016 |2021 |- |Philly Raiders |Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | |2019 |2021 |- |Plaistow Shockers |Plaistow, New Hampshire | |2019 |2021 |- |Red Rose Thunder |Ephrata, Pennsylvania | |2019 |2021 |- |Spa City Gamblers |Saratoga, New York | |2019 |2021 |- |West Chester Wildcats |West Chester, Pennsylvania | |2018 |2021 |- |Western Mass Zombies |Springfield, Massachussetts | |2018 |2021 |- !
