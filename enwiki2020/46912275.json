For more details on contract terminations: Contract termination specifications Teams may buy out player contracts (after the conclusion of a season) for a portion of the remaining value of the contract, paid over a period of twice the remaining length of the contract. This reduced number and extended period is applied to the cap hit as well. *If the player was under the age of 26 at the time of the buyout the player's pay and cap hit will reduced by a factor of 2/3 over the extended period. *If the player was 26 or older at the time of the buyout the player's pay and cap hit will reduced by a factor of 1/3 over the extended period. *If the player was 35 or older at the time of signing the contract the player's pay will be reduced by a factor of 1/3, but the cap hit will not be reduced over the extended period. All players must clear waivers before having a contract terminated. Injured players cannot be bought out. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" ! Date ! Name ! Previous team ! Notes !

the player no longer plays with Team A due to a trade to Team B, but Team A still retains some salary). Only up to 50% of a player's contract can be kept, and only up to 15% of a team's salary cap can be taken up by retained salary. A contract can only be involved in one of these trades twice. === June === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid #999999; width:680px;\" |- | June 26, 2015 | valign=\"top\"| To Buffalo Sabres * * * Robin Lehner David Legwand | valign=\"top\"| To Ottawa Senators * * * NYI's 1st-round pick in 2015 | |-bgcolor=\"eeeeee\" | June 26, 2015 | valign=\"top\"| To Calgary Flames * * * Dougie Hamilton | valign=\"top\"| To Boston Bruins * * * 1st-round pick in 2015 2nd-round pick in 2015 WSH's 2nd-round pick in 2015 | |- | June 26, 2015 | valign=\"top\"| To Los Angeles Kings * * * Milan Lucic* | valign=\"top\"| To Boston Bruins * * * Martin Jones Colin Miller 1st-round pick in 2015 | |-bgcolor=\"eeeeee\" | June 26, 2015 | valign=\"top\"| To Buffalo Sabres * * * Ryan O'Reilly Jamie McGinn | valign=\"top\"| To Colorado Avalanche * * * Nikita Zadorov Mikhail Grigorenko J.T.

Teams received a second-round draft pick if a transaction happened during the season and a third-round pick if one occurred in the off-season (a coach's season ends when his team is eliminated from the playoffs, while seasons for GMs and presidents of hockey operations finish after the conclusion of the NHL Draft in June). Teams will have a three-year window to choose from when to lose their draft pick. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:1px solid #999999; width:780px;\" |- ! Date ! Employee ! Position !
