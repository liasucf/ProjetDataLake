In 2000 she won an ITF singles title at Tampico and a $25,000 doubles title at Mount Pleasant. She took part in the qualifying draw for the 2001 Australian Open and reached her best singles ranking that year of 314 in the world. Her professional tennis career was curtailed by a wrist injury. Johnston, who moved to New York in 2003 to coach tennis, began touring on the professional ITF Beach Tennis Tour in 2005, winning several national titles. She now competes for the United States. ==ITF finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:15%;\" |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" | $25,000 tournaments |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" | $10,000 tournaments |} ===Singles (1\u20131)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" !Outcome !No. !Date !Tournament !Surface !Opponent !Score |-style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Runner-up | 1. | 9 May 1999 | Poza Rica, Mexico | Hard | Joana Cortez | 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 2\u20136 |-style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" | bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner | 1. | 8 May 2000 | Tampico, Mexico | Hard | Daniela Olivera | 6\u20133, 6\u20130 |} ===Doubles (1\u20135)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% |- !
