    "text": "The Passion is a television drama serial produced by the BBC and HBO Films in association with Deep Indigo Productions. It tells the story of the last week in the life of Jesus. The serial was first proposed by Peter Fincham in 2006, on the success of the contemporary-set Manchester Passion. Writer Frank Deasy and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark were inspired to make a drama that opened up the story beyond the \"vacuum\" it is often told in. They did this by expanding the roles of Pontius Pilate and Caiaphas, and exploring the politics of Judea at the time. Deasy and Stafford-Clark were aided by scholar Mark Goodacre, with whom they put together an extensive research manual about the topic. The part of Jesus is played by Joseph Mawle, who researched the role by reading the Gospels and research papers. Other main roles were played by Paloma Baeza (Mary Magdalene), Ben Daniels (Caiaphas), James Nesbitt (Pilate), David Oyelowo (Joseph of Arimathea), and Penelope Wilton (Mary). It was directed by Michael Offer on location in Morocco from 27 August to 23 October 2007, and broadcast on BBC One in four parts from 16 to 23 March 2008. Its viewing figures ranged from 3.2 million to 4.9 million people, and it received generally positive critical reception. ==Plot== Episode 1 \u2014 In the first hour- long episode, Jesus's arrival in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday causes a stir among the Jews. The Romans are having to deal with a small rebellion and the High Priest wants to be rid of Jesus, since he is causing a disturbance and challenging his authority. Episode 2 \u2014 In the second half-hour episode, the High Priest Caiaphas calls a council to determine how Jesus should be dealt with after he is overheard mocking the Temple, and his fate is sealed. Episode 3 \u2014 The third hour-long episode, relates the events from the Last Supper to the Crucifixion of Jesus. Episode 4 \u2014 The final half-hour episode, features the Resurrection of Jesus, the sightings of him by Mary Magdalene and others, and his departure from the disciples after impressing upon Peter the importance of spreading his word. Caiaphus' wife gives birth to a son, and Pilate and his wife return to Caesarea. ==Production== At a conference in April 2006, Controller of BBC One Peter Fincham announced that following the success of the Manchester Passion\u2014a contemporary retelling of the passion that was broadcast live from the streets of Manchester\u2014a \"straight\" adaptation would be produced for broadcast in 2008. Fincham wanted it to be the \"centrepiece\" of BBC One's Easter 2008 schedule and hoped that it would have the same impact as Jesus of Nazareth did in the 1970s.Plunkett, John (26 April 2006). \"BBC plans epic retelling of Jesus's life\", The Guardian, Guardian News and Media. Retrieved 3 August 2008. Nigel Stafford-Clark, the producer of BBC One's successful 2005 adaptation of Bleak House, was brought on as producer, and a contract was tendered for a writer. Frank Deasy was announced as having won the contract in July 2006. Stafford-Clark chose him because he believed that Deasy understood the scale of the project.Brown, Maggie (7 July 2006). \"From Prime Suspect to The Passion: Deasy tackles last week in life of Christ\", MediaGuardian, Guardian News and Media. Retrieved 3 August 2008. The production was budgeted at \u00a34 million. Both Deasy and Stafford-Clark looked to emulate the style of The Gospel According to St. Matthew (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1964) over The Passion of the Christ (Mel Gibson, 2004). Deasy had walked out of The Passion of the Christ after 20 minutes because it \"drained the spirituality of Jesus\". Jesus of Nazareth had opposite effect on him, in that he believed Franco Zeffirelli's version was too spiritual. In his version, Deasy wanted to \"draw Jesus down into the world more as a human character who is frustrated, angry, fearful and doubtful, and who doesn't have what is almost a mask of humanity, but is truly human.\"Jenkins, Simon (2008). \"Frank Deasy interview\", Rejesus.co.uk. Retrieved 3 September 2008. Deasy and Stafford-Clark formed a development team, bringing on religion scholar Dr Mark Goodacre and the BBC's head of religion and ethics, Michael Wakelin. Together, they prepared a research manual containing as much information as they could find about Jerusalem, first-century lifestyles, and the gospels.Wilson, Benji (15\u201321 March 2008). \"Last days of Jesus\", Radio Times, BBC Magazines, pp. 14\u201318. Following his appointment as writer, Deasy spent the next year researching the gospels in Israel and consulting Goodacre.Jenkins, Garry (1 March 2008). \"The BBC's bold new interpretation of The Passion\", The Times, Times Newspapers. Retrieved 3 August 2008. His first draft was submitted in the autumn of 2006. Drawing on what he had learned from Jesus of Nazareth, Deasy chose to portray Jesus as the \"human character\" in Matthew and Mark, rather than the god-like figure in John. He also incorporated Jesus's relationship with women as written in Luke. For the opening scene of Episode 1, he was influenced by the opening scene of Downfall (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2004): > In it, a peasant coming to Passover in Jerusalem is frightened when he comes > across the disciples, because they've been in the desert or in Galilee for > two years. They've been sleeping out and they appear slightly intimidating > to him. It attempts to introduce a world in which Christianity didn't yet > exist and these precepts and concepts that are so familiar to us now, were > startlingly new and really exploded on the scene during this crucial week. Deasy and Stafford-Clark were also interested in opening up the story beyond the \"vacuum\" in which they believe other depictions of the week are set. They did this by expanding the roles of Caiaphas and Pilate beyond mere \"panto villains\", and examining the politics of Judea at the time; Deasy explained that it was \"much more rich to see Caiaphas as a flawed human being\". Joseph Mawle was the first actor auditioned for the part of Jesus. He was cast in May 2007 and prepared for the role by reading \"the Gospels, research papers, medical documents, endless books and prayers\".Higgins, Ria; Joseph Mawle (19 October 2008). \"Best of times, worst of times\", The Sunday Times, Times Newspapers. Retrieved 3 August 2008. Mawle wanted to meet actor Robert Powell to discuss his portrayal of Jesus in Jesus of Nazareth, but the two could not arrange a convenient time. By chance, the two met in the toilets at Gatwick Airport when Powell was going on holiday with his family and Mawle was leaving for Morocco to film The Passion.Matthewman, Scott (20 May 2010). \"Holby City\u2019s Robert Powell on \u2018flatlining\u2019 acting style, the BBC licence fee and soap-vs- drama \". The Stage Online. Retrieved 21 May 2010. James Nesbitt was filming in Belfast when his agent sent him the script. He initially did not want the part, but took it when his agent told him that Stafford-Clark was the producer; Nesbitt had enjoyed his version of Bleak House.

Retrieved 3 August 2008. Paloma Baeza felt a \"responsibility\" when she was offered the part of Mary Magdalene because of the scale of the story being told. Of playing Mary, she said, \"I was looking at her journey, who this person was and her relationship to Jesus. And looking at her as a woman and her predicament.\"Jenkins, Simon (2008). \"Paloma Baeza interview\". Rejesus.co.uk. Retrieved 3 August 2008. Production was based at the Atlas Studios in Morocco.

Scenes in Jerusalem were filmed in Tamnougalt. Many scenes were filmed with hand-held cameras to make it appear that the audience is \"eavesdropping\" on characters' conversations.Jenkins, Simon (2008). \"Nigel Stafford-Clark interview\". Rejesus.co.uk. Retrieved 3 August 2008. A significant scene was the crucifixion in Episode 3. The scene was filmed over three days and was frequently interrupted by torrential downpours. Mawle's make-up call came at 3.30 a.m. and it took five hours to apply cuts, bruises and blisters to his body. As he carried the cross over the sand, Mawle imagined the pain and exhaustion Jesus felt when he did it. Contrary to traditional depictions of the crucifixion, where Jesus is shown nailed to the cross by his hands, production designer Simon Elliot chose to show Jesus in the foetal position, with the nails through his arms. Mark Goodacre advised that this was the most common and effective method of crucifixion used by the Romans, and Elliot believed that \"the Victorian image\" did not match historical evidence; The Passions interpretation was based on a skeleton of a crucified man that was discovered near Jerusalem in the 1960s.Wynne-Jones, Jonathan (18 March 2008). \"Why the BBC thinks Christ did not die this way\", The Daily Telegraph, Telegraph Media Group. 3,000 extras participated in the trial scenes in Episode 3.
