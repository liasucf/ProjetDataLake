    "text": "The USBWA National Freshman of the Year, with the men's and women's versions respectively named the Wayman Tisdale Award and Tamika Catchings Award, is an annual basketball award given to college basketball's most outstanding freshman male player and female player by the United States Basketball Writers Association, an association of college basketball journalists. The award was first given following the 1988\u201389 season for men, while the 2002\u201303 season marked the first season for the women's award. There has never been a tie for the men's award but there has been one for the women, when Tasha Humphrey of Georgia and Candice Wiggins of Stanford shared the 2004\u201305 award. Only three players, all men, have been named the National Player of the Year (by receiving the Naismith or Wooden awards for either men or women, and/or the Wade Trophy for women) in the same season as being named the USBWA Freshman of the Year. Kevin Durant of Texas was the first in 2006\u201307, followed by Anthony Davis of Kentucky in 2011\u201312 and Zion Williamson of Duke in 2018\u201319. Chris Jackson and Seimone Augustus, the two inaugural award winners for the men and women, respectively, were coincidentally both players at LSU. On July 26, 2010, the USBWA announced that they would rename the men's National Freshman of the Year award after the late Wayman Tisdale, who in 1983 was named a first-team All-American as a freshman at Oklahoma. The women's award was officially named in honor of Tamika Catchings on October 17, 2019. As a freshman at Tennessee in 1997\u201398, she averaged 18.2 points for the undefeated national champion Lady Volunteers. Catchings went on to be named a three-time USBWA All-American and the organization's national player of the year in 2000 before playing 16 seasons in the WNBA, retiring as the league's all-time leader in rebounds, steals, and made free throws, plus second in points. She also won four Olympic gold medals with the USA national team. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background:#cfecec;\"| \u2020 |Co-National Freshman of the Year |- | style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"| * |Awarded a national Player of the Year award as a freshman: the Naismith College Player of the Year or the John R.
