    "text": "Het vind () is the debut studio album by Swedish singer-songwriter Marie Fredriksson, originally released on LP and Cassette formats on 20 September 1984 by EMI Sweden. The album was preceded by its lead single, \"\u00c4nnu doftar k\u00e4rlek\" (\"Still the Scent of Love\"), and both that single and the album became top twenty hits in her native country. The title track was released as the second and final single, although it failed to chart. This single was backed by a Swedish cover of Cyndi Lauper's \"All Through the Night\", which was translated by producer Lars-G\u00f6ran \"Lasse\" Lindbom, and re-titled \"Natt efter natt\" (\"Night After Night\"). This song was included as a bonus track when the album was released on CD for the first time on 2 June 1987. ==Background and recording== The album was recorded with many of the same musicians who featured on Per Gessle's 1983 debut solo album, with whom Fredriksson would later form pop duo Roxette. Gessle composed two songs for the record: \"Tag detta hj\u00e4rta\" (\"Take This Heart\") and \"Rickie Lee\", although the latter was not selected for inclusion. Gessle's own recording of the song subsequently appeared on his 1985 album Scener, and Fredriksson's version would remain unreleased until Het vind was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003. Unlike the power pop of Fredriksson's previous band MaMas Barn (MaMas Children) \u2013 which she formed in the late 70's with her then-boyfriend Martin Sternhufvud, who also wrote one song for the album: \"Jag ska ge allt\" (\"I'll Give Everything\") \u2013 Het vind is a relatively contemporary record. Its material is predominantly composed of soft rock, and several songs feature arrangements indicative of Roxette's later power ballad tracks, such as \"Listen to Your Heart\" and \"Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)\". A number of other songs contain elements of disco and 80s synth-pop. ==Formats and track listings== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Het vind. * Marie Fredriksson \u2013 vocals, backing vocals and synthesizer * Per \"Pelle\" Andersson \u2013 backing vocals and drums * \"Backa\" Hans Eriksson \u2013 bass * Jan \"Nane\" Kvills\u00e4ter \u2013 electric guitars * Lars-G\u00f6ran \"Lasse\" Lindbom \u2013 backing vocals, percussion, acoustic guitar and production * Hans \"Hasse\" Olsson \u2013 keyboards * Per \"Pelle\" Sir\u00e9n \u2013 electric guitars * Niklas Str\u00f6mstedt \u2013 backing vocals Technical personnel * Bj\u00f6rn Almstedt \u2013 mastering * Kjell Andersson \u2013 sleeve design * Calle Bengtsson \u2013 photography * Bj\u00f6rn Bostr\u00f6m \u2013 engineering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalog # ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| Sweden | 20 September 1984 | | rowspan=\"2\"| EMI | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| |- | 2 June 1987 | CD | style=\"text- align:center;\"| CDP-7467192 |- | June 2002 | Remastered 24-bit HDCD: K\u00e4rlekens guld box set | rowspan=\"2\"| Capitol Records | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7243 5 40199-2 0 |- | 5 March 2003 | CD | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 7243 5 39787-2 3 |} ==References== Category:1984 debut albums Category:Marie Fredriksson albums ",
