    "text": "Dominic Nicholas Anthony Lucinese (August 22, 1897 \u2013 July 28, 1982), known professionally as Nick Lucas, was an American jazz guitarist and singer. He was the first jazz guitarist to record as a soloist. His popularity during his lifetime came from his reputation as a singer. His signature song was \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". ==Career== Lucas was born into an Italian family in Newark, New Jersey. In 1922, at the age of 25, he gained renown with his hit renditions of \"Pickin' the Guitar\" and \"Teasin' the Frets\" for Path\u00e9. In 1923, Gibson Guitars proposed to build him a concert guitar with a deeper body. Known as the \"Nick Lucas Special,\" it became a popular model with guitarists. It was this guitar's outline that was later used as the basis for the Gibson Les Paul solidbody electric guitar. Also in 1923, he began recording for Brunswick and remained one of their exclusive artists until 1932. In 1929, Lucas co-starred in the Warner Bros. musical, Gold Diggers of Broadway, in which he introduced the two hit songs \"Painting the Clouds with Sunshine\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\". The same year, Lucas was featured in the studio's all-star revue, The Show of Shows. Lucas turned down Warner Bros. seven-year contract offer, which went instead to fellow crooner Dick Powell. In April 1930, Warner bought Brunswick and gave him his own orchestra, billed on his records as \"The Crooning Troubadours\". This arrangement lasted until December 1931, when Warner licensed Brunswick to the American Record Corporation (ARC). The new owners were not as extravagant as Warner Bros. had previously been and Lucas lost his orchestra and eventually left Brunswick in 1932. He made two recordings for Durium in 1932 for their Hit of the Week series. These would prove to be his last major recordings. Lucas spent the rest of his career performing on radio, in night clubs and dance halls. He made a number of recordings for small or independent labels, including Cavalier, where he was billed as the \"Cavalier Troubadour.\" In 1944 he reprised some of his old hits in soundies movie musicals, and filmed another group of songs for Snader Telescriptions in 1951. He signed with Accent in 1955 and remained with the label for 25 years. In 1974, his renditions of the songs, \"I'm Gonna Charleston Back to Charleston\", \"When You and I Were Seventeen\" and \"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\" were featured on the soundtrack of The Great Gatsby (1974). Lucas became friends with Tiny Tim, who considered him an inspiration and who borrowed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as his own theme song. Lucas sang the song with him when he married Miss Vicki on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson on December 17, 1969. Lucas died in Colorado Springs, Colorado of double pneumonia three weeks before his 85th birthday. ==Discography== * Painting the Clouds with Sunshine (Decca, 1958) * Tip-Toe Thru' The Tulips (ASV Living Era, 2000) ==References== ==External links== *Official site * * Category:1897 births Category:1982 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:American jazz guitarists Category:American jazz singers Category:Musicians from Newark, New Jersey Category:Vaudeville performers Category:20th-century American male actors Category:20th-century American singers Category:American people of Italian descent Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Guitarists from New Jersey Category:Brunswick Records artists ",
