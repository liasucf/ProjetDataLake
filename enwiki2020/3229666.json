    "text": "The Rathong Glacier is an important glacier of Western Sikkim, India. The source of the Rathong River flows from the snout of Rathong Glacier. This glacier extends from Rathong La in the north almost to the top of Chowrikiang Valley in the South. It is fed by the Mt. Rathong (6678m) and Ice Falls of Kabru group of peaks. Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling has set up their permanent base camp at Chowrikiang to practice ice crafting to their trainees in Rathong Glacier from the inception of the institute; thus the glacier is well-known to mountaineers all over the world. At present, due to global warming, the glacier is receding rapidly and a number of glacial lakes have formed. ==See also== * List of glaciers ==References== Category:Glaciers of Sikkim ",
