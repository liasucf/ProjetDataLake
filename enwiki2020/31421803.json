It was transferred from the Tokugawa family to Nagoya City in 1950. Presently the library has about 110,000 items including classic literature. In 1978 it became a branch of the Nagoya City Museum. The library cooperates closely with the neighbouring Tokugawa Art Museum and the Tokugawa Garden. == External links == *Homepage of the H\u014dsa Library Category:Libraries in Nagoya Category:Owari Tokugawa family ",
