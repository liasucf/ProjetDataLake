    "text": "Gregorio Jes\u00fas Gil y Gil (12 March 1933 \u2013 14 May 2004) was a Spanish businessman and politician. He served as Mayor of Marbella between 1991 and 2002, and presided for a 16-year tenure as president of the Spanish football club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. ==Career== === Business === In the 1960s Gil ran a construction firm building gated communities. A complex he had built in San Rafael, near Segovia, collapsed in 1969, killing 58 people and injuring many others. A subsequent investigation showed that the cement in the new building had not yet set, and the whole project had been completed without use of Architects, surveyors, or plans. Gil was sentenced to five years in prison, but was pardoned after 18 months by General Francisco Franco. ===Football=== In 1987, Gil was elected president at football side Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (his first signing was that of 21-year-old Portuguese winger Paulo Futre), where he initiated a volatile relationship with fans, reporters, players and head coaches. In 1992, he shut down Atl\u00e9tico's youth academy, which saw talented 15-year-old Ra\u00fal switch to crosstown rivals Real Madrid. Most of Marbella's local police were recruited indirectly by Gil among legionnaires and members of other elite military forces throughout southern Spain and Northern Africa during the 1980s / 1990s, and some of these officers comprised Gil's own private garde de corps. In a March 1997 incident, as the two teams met in the 1996\u201397 Champions League quarterfinals, Gil referred to Ajax Amsterdam, due to its many players of Surinamese origin, as FC Congo. ===Politics=== In 1991, he founded and led the Grupo Independiente Liberal (GIL) as his political vehicle, and was elected as mayor of Marbella the same year. He installed a bust of Francisco Franco in the town hall and was known for walking the streets of the town shouting abuse at prostitutes and homeless people. His mayorship was popular enough for him to be re-elected three times. In April 2002, he was banned for 28 years from holding public office, forced to stand down as mayor and briefly imprisoned. In early 2008, a full, two-episode documentary appeared in Tele 5 explaining the highlights of his life and career. ==Death== On 9 May 2004 he suffered a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in his finca in Valdeolivas and died in Madrid in 14 May at the age of 71. The funeral was attended by 20,000 people. He was cremated and his ashes were interred in the family mausoleum at the Cementerio de la Almudena. ==Political reputation== Gil was famous and controversial for his extreme social and political views, summed up in a unique brand of foulmouthed, low-brow populism Jes\u00fas Gil como met\u00e1fora: poder, burbuja y populismo punctuated by self- aggrandizing,Gil alardea ante sus pe\u00f1as sexist,La Tamayo del sur homophobic,La UEFA aplaza la sanci\u00f3n a Gil por llamar homosexual a Vautrot y le citaLa UEFA pide a Gil que explique por qu\u00e9 llam\u00f3 homosexual al \u00e1rbitro Vautrot racist,Gil: \"Al negro le corto la cabeza\"El Atl\u00e9tico pone fin a la 'era Gil' xenophobic and otherwise derogatory20 a\u00f1os de la era Gil remarks and, occasionally, by pre-democratic nostalgia.Gil recupera un busto de Franco para Marbella He publicly referred to former Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) town councilor Isabel Garc\u00eda Marcos as a \"whore\" during town council meetings and, on one occasion, dubbed journalist Carmen Rigalt as \"la jinetera del periodismo\" (prostitute of journalism). The M\u00e1laga coastline, effectively under the area of economic and political influence of the Gil family, became a popular residence for British, Italian, and Russian gangsters while he was mayor, as well as a haven for former national socialists either awaiting or avoiding extradition, such as Otto Remer and L\u00e9on Degrelle. At the same time, however, Gil instigated several crackdowns on drug users and prostitutes. He was involved in several criminal cases, including the so-called Caso de las camisetas. and Caso Atl\u00e9tico. Crime rates and open manifestations of poverty decreased dramatically during the first years of his administration but this apparent success was obtained at the expense of civil liberties, including the beatings of delinquents and prostitutes, deportation of foreigners with low incomes, handouts of money to homeless people in exchange for leaving town, etc. The subsequent apparent improvement in the lifestyle of a segment of the population was cited as a main reason for his re-election.El nido de Jes\u00fas Gil ==See also== *Marbella City Council dissolution ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from the Province of Soria Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid presidents Category:Liberal Independent Group politicians Category:Mayors of places in Andalusia Category:Disease-related deaths in Spain Category:Spanish politicians convicted of crimes Category:Scandals in Spain Category:Municipal councillors in the province of M\u00e1laga ",
