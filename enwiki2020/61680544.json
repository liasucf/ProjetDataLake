It reached the Top 40 in fifteen countries worldwide and is certified Gold or higher in the United States, Canada, and Australia. ==Background and promotion== In March 2019, Halsey announced that her upcoming third studio album would be released in 2019 and that she wants it to be \"perfect\". On September 3, 2019, Halsey revealed the cover art and release date of \"Graveyard\" on her social media. The announcement was made a day after fans questioned the singer about upcoming news. The song was made available for pre-save upon announcement. Halsey performed the song for the first time on September 11, 2019, as one of the musical guests on Rihanna's \"Savage X Fenty\" show. She posted a teaser containing a still from the music video as well as a line from the song on her social media that same day. ==Composition== \"Graveyard\" is a pop and electropop song written by Halsey with Amy Allen, Jon Bellion, Jordan K. Johnson, Louis Bell, Mark Williams and Stefan Johnson. Its production was done by Bellion, Bell, Ojivolta and The Monsters and the Strangerz. According to Halsey, the song \"is about being in love with someone who is in a bad place and loving them so much that you don't realize that you're going to that bad place with them\". It also deals with the topic of caring for yourself instead of following others. ==Critical reception== Althea Legaspi and Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone wrote that the song's lyrical content \"addresses following a relationship down a dark road despite warning signs\" and noted the \"contemplative guitar melody\". Rania Aniftos at Billboard referred to the song as an \"emotional tune\". Writing for Idolator, Mike Nied complimented the song for being \"self-aware, vulnerable and very relatable\" and pointed out Jon Bellion's obvious presence on its production, calling it a \"a lush pop production\". ==Music video== The song release was supported by a time-lapse visualizer of Halsey painting a self- portrait which also serves as the album cover for Manic. The official music video was released on October 8, 2019, and features Halsey and a mysterious girl (Sydney Sweeney) magically from her notebook dancing alone in an amusement park. When the bridge starts, the mysterious girl disappears while Halsey enters an aquarium, which looks similar to the video for her song, \"Clementine\". Immediately, she wakes up into a white abandoned version of the park, later teleporting to her bedroom of the same color. == Live performances == Halsey performed \"Graveyard\" for the first time at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards on November 3, 2019; also during the 47th American Music Awards ceremony on November 24 and the Australian ARIA Music Awards of 2019 on November 27. ;List of televised performances * September 19, 2019 \u2013 Savage X Fenty Fashion Showhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisFkQHP5sY * September 30, 2019 \u2013 iHeartRadio Music Festivalhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP76mWj78Sw * October 28, 2019 \u2013 The Ellen DeGeneres Showhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJdT-b6PeFc&list;=PL4u7-QW- Ue3rWzQqZ4Lj8jV5uAO776uwu&index;=10 * October 30, 2019 \u2013 Idol Sverigehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apZrtznyTjg * November 2, 2019 \u2013 MTV Europe Music Awardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hlYd0GgzoI&list;=PL4u7-QW- Ue3rWzQqZ4Lj8jV5uAO776uwu&index;=9 * November 12, 2019 \u2013 Country Music Association Awards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vgXXK3Vec&list;=PL4u7-QW- Ue3rWzQqZ4Lj8jV5uAO776uwu&index;=4v * November 15, 2019 \u2013 The Jonathan Ross Showhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERdGVqUYnVI * November 24, 2019 \u2013 American Music Awardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARNZ-nam9dE&list;=PL4u7-QW- Ue3rWzQqZ4Lj8jV5uAO776uwu&index;=12 * November 26, 2019 \u2013 Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moMeB4f0ga8&list;=PL4u7-QW- Ue3rWzQqZ4Lj8jV5uAO776uwu&index;=11 * December 9, 2019 \u2013 Pandora Live concerthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW5Vlb8qc4g * March 25, 2020 - CMT Crossroads ==Other uses== The song appears on the US edition of Now That\u2019s What I Call Music! 73, marking the first appearance for Halsey in the US Now! series. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal and Spotify. * Halsey \u2013 vocals, songwriting * Ojivolta \u2013 production * Louis Bell \u2013 production, songwriting, record engineering, programming, keyboards * Jon Bellion \u2013 production, songwriting, keyboards, programming *Amy Allen \u2013 songwriting, background vocals, guitar * Mark Williams \u2013 production, songwriting, guitar, keyboards, programming * The Monsters and the Strangerz \u2013 production, songwriting, engineering, keyboards, programming * Chris Gehringer \u2013 mastering engineering * John Hanes \u2013 mixing engineering * Serban Ghenea \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u20132020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Estonia (Eesti Ekspress) | 26 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 30 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 22 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 20 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 27 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Airplay 100) | 93 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Singapore (RIAS) | 18 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 95 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 25 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 734 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | rowspan=\"2\"| September 13, 2019 | | rowspan=\"5\"| Original | rowspan=\"7\"| Capitol | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | rowspan=\"3\"| Contemporary hit radio | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | September 14, 2019 | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | September 17, 2019 | |- | September 30, 2019 | Hot adult contemporary | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | October 31, 2019 | scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| | Axwell Remix | |- | November 12, 2019 | Acoustic | |- |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Halsey (singer) songs Category:Songs written by Halsey (singer) Category:Songs written by Jon Bellion Category:Songs written by Louis Bell Category:Songs written by Stefan Johnson Category:Songs written by Jordan Johnson (songwriter) Category:Song recordings produced by The Monsters & Strangerz Category:Song recordings produced by Louis Bell Category:Songs written by Amy Allen (songwriter) ",
