    "text": "Martial Law is an American-Canadian action-adventure comedy television series that aired on CBS from September 26, 1998, to May 13, 2000, and was created by Carlton Cuse. The title character, Sammo Law (Sammo Hung), is a Chinese law officer and martial arts expert who comes to Los Angeles in search of a colleague and remains in the US. The show was a surprise hit, making Hung the only East Asian headlining a primetime network series in the United States. At the time, Hung was not fluent in English and worried about the audience's ability to understand him. In many scenes, Hung does not speak at all, making Martial Law one of the few US television series to feature little dialogue from the lead character. The show lasted two seasons, before being cancelled due to high production costs and Hung being unhappy with the writing of season two. ==Cast== * Sammo Hung as Detective-Captain Sammo Law (seasons one and two, all episodes) * Arsenio Hall as Detective-Lieutenant Terrell Parker (seasons one and two) * Kelly Hu as Detective Grace \"Pei Pei\" Chen (seasons one and two, all episodes) * Tammy Lauren as Detective Dana Doyle (season one, first five episodes) * Louis Mandylor as Detective Louis Malone (season one) * Tom Wright as Lieutenant Benjamin Winship (season one) * Gretchen Egolf as Captain Amy Dylan (season two) ==Production== CBS Series poster ===Season one=== The creator, Carlton Cuse, was aware that CBS was in need of a show that would attract young male viewers to its Saturday-night schedule. Stanley Tong suggested a cop show based on Police Story 3: Super Cop, a movie that he directed and in which Jackie Chan starred. Jackie Chan was contacted by Tong, but declined (Chan was set to appear in episode five \"Cop Out\", strolling into the background of one scene, but the bit was cut from the final version). Shannon Lee also was guest cast as Vanessa Feng in episode eight, \"Take Out\". Tong then approached Sammo Hung, a good friend and occasional co-star of Chan's. Still eager to fill the 9 pm program slot, CBS agreed very quickly and production began on the series. After the first six episodes had aired, they knew it was a hit. The production, however, was not without complications, as Hung was used to the control over filming he had in Hong Kong and was not fluent in English. Hung was not delighted to be filming in early mornings and late night that American television productions require. ===Season two=== New executive producers Lee Goldberg and William Rabkin took the helm at the beginning of the second season due to runaway production costs. They more or less pretended that the first season did not exist, retaining only the basic concept of a fish-out-of-water detective. Cast members Louis Mandylor and Tom Wright were dropped. Gretchen Egolf was brought in to play the unit's new leader, Amy Dylan, from the beginning of season two. Additionally, Parker's past in public relations was scrapped. The first season's cliffhanger ending (plus the dropping of Mandylor and Wright's characters) was explained away with a few throwaway lines. Law made crossover appearances on episodes of Early Edition and Walker, Texas Ranger, the former preceding it and the latter following it in its Saturday time slot. Chuck Norris's Walker character, Cordell Walker, also made an appearance as part of the two-part Martial Law/Walker, Texas Ranger crossover. ===Cancelation=== After season two, CBS offered Sammo Hung a third season, but Hung said he would not do it without a final say on scripts, claiming that the new screenwriter CBS assigned to the show for season two made him nothing but a fighting machine. An article in the magazine Black Belt mentions that due to the $2 million cost of production per episode, the show was cancelled. ==Plot== The basic storyline is that Sammo Law, a well-respected Chinese cop, is transferred to America. As he works for the police department, fighting crime in Los Angeles, he is met with a clash in culture. He is also the mentor of Grace \"Pei Pei\" Chen, an undercover officer. When American techniques do not work, Sammo employs some Chinese cop work to get the job done. ===Season one=== Sammo is sent by the Chinese government to apprehend an old nemesis, Lee Hei (Tzi Ma). He finds out that his disciple, Pei Pei, had infiltrated Lee Hei's criminal empire. His goal is to capture Lee Hei and end his criminal organization. Unfortunately, this plot line was unresolved and season one ended in a cliffhanger, although season two's premiere has Sammo alluding to Lee Hei's death (by way of accusing a one-shot villain of trying to avenge it). Dana Doyle (Tammy Lauren) was initially billed as a main character, but left after only a few episodes; she was explained to have moved to another police force to be closer to her family. ===Season two=== After Winship's retirement and Louis's transfer to the NYPD, Law decides to stay in Los Angeles and is now partnered with Pei Pei. The department also gets a new captain, Amy Dylan, who thinks that the Chinese way of police work is not the best way of handling things. In addition, revelations are made of a secret society whose members include Law's long-lost son. While Law decided to return to China in the last episode, a line of dialogue leaves open the possibility of a follow-up. ==Episodes== \"Honor Among Strangers\" is part one of a crossover with Walker, Texas Ranger, wherein Sammo teams up with Cordell Walker to apprehend a hate-mongering former military officer who later escapes Walker's custody in the Walker, Texas Ranger episode \"The Day of Cleansing\". ==Ratings== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Season !!U.S. ratings !!Network !!Rank |- | 1 || 1998\u20131999 ||11.00 million ||CBS ||#57 |- | 2 || 1999\u20132000 ||10.08 million ||CBS ||#59 |- |} The show aired on Saturday nights throughout its run. ==International broadcasters== In the UK and Ireland, the show used to air on Five from 1998\u20132005, then on ITV4 showing replays of the episodes from 2005\u20132007 and then on Bravo from 2009-2011.
