    "text": "Insignia of the order awarded to Polish Gen. J\u00f3zef Haller. The Military Order of the World War was created in 1919 at the suggestion of General of the Armies John J. Pershing as a fraternity for American military officers coming out of the Great War. Two decades later, when the USA became involved in WWII the organization name was pluralized to its current title of Military Order of the World Wars. Though the Order's title has not changed since 1945, it remains an officers\u2019 society welcoming new qualified members in current military service, retired military service, or former military service and has members from the Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, War in Iraq, and peacetime service.http://www.moww.org/ ==Membership== Membership in the MOWW is open to active duty, retired and former commissioned or warrant officers of the uniformed services of the United States. This includes the US Army (USA), US Navy (USN), US Marine Corps (USMC), and the US Air Force (USAF). It also includes the US Coast Guard (USCG), United States Public Health Service (USPHS), and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, any direct lineal descendant from a qualifying officer may also join the order, which indicates that the order also serves as a genealogical society.http://www.moww.org/ Famous members include: * General of the Armies John J.

Marshall * General William Westmoreland * President (former army captain, WWI) Harry Truman * President (former army captain, WWII) Ronald Reaganhttp://www.usmilitariaforum.com/forums/index.php?/topic/2955-military- order-of-the-world-wars/ == Centennial Anniversary and Recent Projects == In 2019 the Order celebrated its 100th birthday at its annual convention held in Simi Valley, California. * Recent notable projects in 2019 included the design, purchase, and placement of a $100k Augusta-CSRA Vietnam War Veterans Memorial, in Augusta, Georgia, by the Augusta Chapter of Region V, MOWW, earning Chapter leaders a Gold Patrick Henry Award and National Citation. ==Awards and Insignia== *Gold Patrick Henry Award - awarded by the national chapter annually to nine (9) companions of the Order for exceptional achievement. *Silver Patrick Henry Award - awarded by local chapters to companions for superior service, lifesaving, and more.
