    "text": "Cora is a given name, most commonly derived from the Ancient Greek \u039a\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7 (K\u00f3r\u0113), an epithet of the Greek goddess Persephone. Alternatively, but rarely, it may be rooted in the Gaelic cora, the comparative of c\u00f3ir, meaning just, honest, virtuous or good. Common forms of this name include Kora and Korra. == History == The current name Cora may be derived from a variety of origins. Its most prominent antecedents, however, lie in ancient Greece. === Ancient Greece === The Greek word \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7 (kor\u0113) can mean girl, maiden or daughter. In the latter sense it came to be an alternate name given to Persephone to denote her being the daughter of Demeter, who accordingly carries the epithet \u039c\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 (M\u0113t\u0113r), mother. \u039a\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7 was used when addressing Persephone not as queen of the underworld, but as vegetation goddess.Bacchus and Cora. Roman copy made in the 2nd century after a Greek original.Today\u2019s pronunciation of Cora is foreshadowed in some Greek dialects. In both Doric and Aeolic \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7 becomes \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1 (kora), in Doric it also appears as \u03ba\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 (k\u014dra), thus phonetically resembling the current English name rather closely. The spelling \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1 is used especially in poetic writings, as in the following instance by Aeschylus: > \u1f14\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5 \u03b4\u1fbd \u1fa7 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03c6\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac: \u1f14\u03b8\u03b9\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b4\u1fbd \u1f10\u03bd \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u1fb3 \u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 > \u1f10\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u2014\u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03ad \u03bd\u03b9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u1f76 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c2\u2014 > \u1f40\u03bb\u03ad\u03b8\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u1fbd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f10\u03c7\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd.Aesch.

As pointed out by H. Weir Smith, \u0394\u03af\u03ba\u03b1 (\u201cJustice\u201d) can be read as a contraction of \u0394\u03b9(\u1f78\u03c2) \u03ba(\u03cc\u03c1)\u03b1, \u201cdaughter of Zeus\u201d. Metaphorically, \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7 and its variants can also refer to a puppet; the pupil of the eye, because a small image is mirrored within, and hence figuratively also the apple of one's eye.Gemoll, Wilhelm (1954). Griechisch-Deutsches Schul- und Handw\u00f6rterbuch, 9th ed. Munich. p. 447. === Ancient Rome === In its current spelling, Cora appears as a Latinisation of Persephone's epithet in Roman inscriptions. Fabia Aconia Paulina for example, who lived in the 4th century, was consecrated to Cora twice.CIL VI, 1780 Of different, namely Celtic, decent is Cora as toponym for a town and river (today la Cure) in the Roman province of Gaul. === Modernity === In The Court of the Gentiles (1669), his extensive attempt to trace all ancient ideas and beliefs back to Hebrew scriptures, Theophilus Gale claims that Cora originated from the Hebrew \u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 (hora).Gale, Theophilus (1672). The Court of the Gentiles, 2nd edition. p. 23 The name Cora gained prominence among a wider audience through Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel's novel Les Incas of 1777, where it is given to an Inca girl consecrated as a virgin to the sun.Marmontel, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois (1777). Les Incas ou la destruction de l\u2019empire du P\u00e9rou. Paris. pp. 59-63. It is thus used much in accordance with the original Greek word.

Les Incas ou la destruction de l\u2019empire du P\u00e9rou. Paris. p. 41 \u2013 Marmontel may have found another motive in the ethnic group of the same name, who resisted Spanish conquest until 1722,J\u00e1uregui, Jes\u00fas (2004). Coras.

Brought to fame by Marmontel, Cora inspired a series of other works, among them an opera by the French composer \u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul and a play by the German dramatist August von Kotzebue, Die Sonnenjungfrau (The Virgin of the Sun), both of 1791.Thomas Cole, Cora Kneeling at the Feet of Tamenund, 1827.
