Trees in Stellenberg Bellville ==Name and history== The suburb originates its name from the original farm on which it was developed. The farm were called Stellenburgh (later changed to Stellenburg), and was originally owned by Johannes (Joan) Blesius in 1705. Blesius named it after the Stellenbosch Mountain which one could see from the farm. Stellenbosch is named after the Governor of the Cape Colony, Simon van der Stel. Blesius was awarded the farm by Willem Adriaan van der Stel. This van der Stel was the son of Governor Simon van der Stel. Blesius (b.1656, d.1711) came from Breukelen, the Netherlands. The land felt under the jurisdiction of de Kuijlen. In 1707 Jacobus van der Heijden became owner of the land. The land stayed in the van der Heijde family until JF de Kock bought it. JF de Kock owned it up to 1736, when it was rewarded to Hilletjie Olivier. She died in 1765. On 3 January 1882 it was transferred to John Starke and then to Jacob Jacobus Hamman. In 1883 Charl Marais owned the land. He sold it to Maria Elizabeth Green (b 6 July 1856). In 1898 Hermanus Lambertus Bosman de Waal (b. 21 September 1863) bought it and he sold it to Francois Stephanus de Villiers in 1899.
