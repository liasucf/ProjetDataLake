Domingo left Spain and moved to Buenos Aires in 1750. He worked as a baker; Buenos Aires had a scarce production of bread at the time. Domingo got married with Mar\u00eda Manuela Fern\u00e1ndez Escand\u00f3n on March 8, 1755. Domingo became a vecino after his marriage. Their son Juan Jos\u00e9 Esteban Paso was born on January 2, 1758, and baptized five days later. The place of Paso's initial education is unknown, but it was not the Real Colegio San Carlos, as he is not among its recorded list of students.Tanzi, pp. 9-12 Paso studied at the University of C\u00f3rdoba and graduated in Theology in 1779. Back in Buenos Aires, he was named professor of Philosophy at the Colegio Real de San Carlos (Royal School of San Carlos). In 1783 he moved to the Upper Peru and studied law in the University of Chuquisaca; only to return to Buenos Aires as a lawyer in 1803. After the British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata he pursued a political career as a revolutionary leader moved by the new national identity that was growing among the 'criollos'. Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu\u00e9naga, Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar\u00e1oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L\u00f3pez y Planes, Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza; Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge, but whether that lodge was truly masonic has been debated: ===Juntas=== Paso assisted with the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810 and supported the faction that sought the dismissal of viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, convincing many others with a fervent speech. He participated in the creation of the First Junta (Primera Junta) government on May 25 and was named Secretary of the Junta along with Mariano Moreno, with whom he shared political points of view. He was sent by the Junta to Montevideo (today's Uruguay capital city) to spread the ideas of the revolution. Paso was also part of the First Triumvirate and the Second Triumvirate that ruled the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata (Argentina) between 1811 and 1814. During this period he participated in the Asamblea del a\u00f1o XIII and was sent to Chile as a representative. But the negotiations with Chilean patriots failed and the Capitaincy of Chile refused to take part in the Union. ===Congress of Tucum\u00e1n=== In 1815 Paso was named assistant to the Supreme Director and war consultant. He was later elected a representative to the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n that declared the Argentine Independence on July 9, 1816. As Secretary to this Congress, Paso had the honor of reading the independence act. However, he was then imprisoned and charged of treason for supporting the monarchist faction that wanted a monarchy as government for the new nation. He was quickly released along with the other monarchist deputies. ===Buenos Aires' legislature=== Elected a member of the Buenos Aires Province Legislature in 1822, Paso later became president of that body. In 1824, he was again elected representative for the National Congress and supported the nomination of Bernardino Rivadavia as the first President of Argentina. He retired from politics in 1826 disgusted with the violent disagreements among the provinces that divided themselves between Unitarians and Federalists. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1758 births Category:1833 deaths Category:Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:National University of C\u00f3rdoba alumni Category:Members of the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n Category:Members of the Assembly of the Year XIII Category:Members of the Primera Junta Category:Members of Argentine triumvirates Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery Category: Argentine Freemasons ",
