    "text": "The Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) is a foundation located on the campus of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) whose mission is to promote interdisciplinary research in nanoscience and nanotechnology. In addition to research activities, the ICN2 provides training for researchers, education programs and services to industry and the scientific community. The ICN2 is part of the Catalan Government's organisation for research centres (CERCA) CERCA Centres which aims to encourage and maximise synergies and strategic cooperation between research centres in Catalonia. The Institute is also a founding member of The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology which was established in collaboration with five other research centres in Catalonia to achieve greater international competitiveness by promoting multidisciplinary scientific collaboration in the fields of genomic regulation, chemical research, nanoscience and nanotechnology, photonic sciences, high energy physics and biomedicine.Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology == History == The ICN2 was initially established as the Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology (ICN) in 2003, at the initiative of the Catalan government and the UAB with the aim of attracting international research talent to create a world renowned centre for nanoscience and nanotechnology research. The Spanish Research Council (CSIC) showed interest in participating in the implementation of a mixed centre that would include the ICN and the CSIC. Following conversations between these institutions, they agreed to put their collaboration on an official footing and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in 2006. As a result of this agreement, the Centre for Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CIN2) was created, a centre co-directed by Jordi Pascual (ICN) and Albert Figueras (CSIC). The complete integration of the two constituent parts of this centre arrived in 2011, when CSIC representatives joined the ICN's board of trustees and then in 2013, when the ICN changed its name to the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2). In addition to research, management and financial synergies, an important outcome of this agreement was the construction of a new building on the UAB campus containing state-of-the-art equipment and purpose-built research facilities. The building was inaugurated in 2014 and currently accommodates most of the ICN2 staff. This includes 280 people, comprising about 170 researchers and technicians, 70 temporary external visitors and around 40 administrative staff. == Research == Research at the ICN2 is carried out by the following multi-disciplinary research groups: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 85%;\" |- !

The award was renewed in 2018 for the 2018-2022 period. == Outreach == Education for schools. The ICN2 participates in educational programs designed to increase understanding of nanoscience and the social and scientific role of ICN2. It is worth highlighting its role in the NanoEduca programme, carried out jointly with the University of Barcelona, the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the CESIRE (an educational research centre of the Government of Catalonia). The program includes interactive classroom kits for nanoscience-related experiments and was awarded the 2018 National Scientific Communication Prize.Catalan Foundation for Research and Innovation Education in the community. As part of its mission to promote and facilitate the uptake of nanotechnology in industry, ICN2 holds seminars and workshops to bring together scientists, engineers, technicians, business people and policy makers. The ICN2 also disseminates its research results in the media and provides public forums for discussions on nanotechnology and the work of the ICN2. == Scientific Output == During 2018, ICN2 researchers produced 172 indexed publications with an average impact factor of 8.86. Specifically, 136 of these articles were published in first-quartile journals, while 77 appeared in first-decile journals.ICN2 2018 Annual Report == References == Category:Nanotechnology institutions Category:International research institutes Category:Science and technology in Spain Category:Autonomous University of Barcelona Category:Scientific organisations based in Spain Category:Research institutes in Europe Category:Research institutes in Catalonia ",
