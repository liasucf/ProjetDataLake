    "text": "\u015eirin Tekeli (28 February 1944, Ankara \u2013 13 June 2017, Bodrum) was a feminist, academician, translator, writer, activist and one of the pioneers of second wave feminism in Turkey. ==Early life and education== After graduating from Ankara Kiz Lisesi in 1961, \u015eirin Tekeli moved to France to learn French. By reading Simone de Beauvoir's work, she became familiar with feminism. In 1963 she began studying Law in Paris, however she transitioned to University of Lausanne in Switzerland to study social and political science. She graduated in 1967. ==Career== In 1967, she returned to Turkey and became the first female academician to enter the Chair in political science at Istanbul University. In 1973 she obtained her PhD with a thesis on David Easton's System Theory. In 1978, she obtained her associate professor title with her, at the time \"controversial\", habilitation thesis on women\u2019s participation to politics named \"Kad\u0131nlar ve Siyasal Toplumsal Hayat\". (Women and Political Social Life). This thesis, had a great effect on her ideology, she recalls : \"I was a \"timid feminist\" but by the time I finished it I saw clearly that women were being oppressed, exploited and excluded from the public sphere. It was not capitalism that was doing this, it was male dominance\". After her thesis, she started working on elections. She returned to France and spent the academic year 1979\u20131980 at the Scientific Research National Center (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) (CNRS) with a scholarship, learning cartography. She, during this period, formed a computer database, with all the data concerning the elections in Turkey, and studied the sociology of elections in urban areas with Jean Ranger and his team. In 1980-81 she organized a seminar on the sociology of politics When the Council on Higher Education (Y\u00fcksek\u00f6\u011fretim Kurulu - Y\u00d6K) was established, after the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat, under the military government in Turkey, she resigned from her academic position as she believed that Y\u00d6K limited the freedom of thought and academia. This leave was originally temporary, as Tekeli hoped that Y\u00d6K would only exist for a few years, however, the institution still stands today. ==Activism== After she left academia, she began an active role in the feminist movement of Turkey. Seeing the 80s as the \"years of action\", she dedicated herself to ameliorate women's situation and raise awareness in Turkey via campaigns and protests. In the 90s, \"the years of institutionalisation\", as she calls them, have started: Tekeli focused on creating associations and foundations. ===Years of action=== Following Turkey\u2019s decision on not changing the civic law in accordance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women(CEDAW), in 1986 she took part in a petition demanding changes in the constitution, laws and practice, in accordance with the contract. On 17 May 1987, she participated to the first legal protest after the military coup, and demanded an end to domestic violence. In 1989 she took part in the Mor \u0130\u011fne (Purple Needle) campaign, creating awareness against sexual abuse, In the 1980s she also got involved with various campaigns against murder of divorced women. ===Years of institutionalisation=== To make the fruits of the actions taken in 1980s sustainable, she took part in the creation of the following foundations and associations: * Insan Haklari Dernegi (The Human Rights Association) - 1986 * Helsinki Yurtta\u015flar Derne\u011fi (Helsinki Citizens' Assembly) - 1989 * Mor \u00c7at\u0131 Kad\u0131n S\u0131\u011f\u0131na\u011f\u0131 Vakfi, (Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation) - 1990 * Kad\u0131n Eserleri K\u00fct\u00fcphanesi ve Bilgi Merkezi Vakf\u0131 ( Women's Works Library and Information Center Foundation) - 1996 * Kad\u0131n Adaylar\u0131 Destekleme Derne\u011fi (Association for Supporting Women Candidates - 1997 * Anak\u00fclt\u00fcr Kooperatifi (Anak\u00fclt\u00fcr Cooperative) - 1997 * Winpeace \u2013 Turkish and Greek Women's Peace Initiative - 1997 * \u015eirin-Ahmet Tekeli Kad\u0131n Hukuk\u00e7ular\u0131 Destekleme Vakf\u0131 (\u015eirin-Ahmet Tekeli Association for Supporting Women Lawyers) - 2010 ==Selected works== During her years in academia and after her resignation she contributed to Turkish feminist literature.
