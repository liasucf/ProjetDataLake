    "text": "The 6th (Cyclist) Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment, later 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery was an artillery unit of Britain's part-time army, the Territorial Army (TA). Originally formed after the initial reforms brought on by Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane, the battalion would serve in World War I on the home front, then convert to artillery after reforming in 1921. It would then see service in World War II before being merged into the Suffolk Yeomanry in 1950 as part of the post-war reductions of the Royal Artillery. Although disbanded officially in 1950, the Ipswich and Bury St Edmunds locations of the battalion are used by the unit's successors, No. 677 (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Squadron AAC. == Prewar == H Company mass drills in 1910. On 1 April 1908, as a result of the Territorial reforms implemented by Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane, the Essex and Suffolk Cyclist Battalion was formed with HQ in Colchester. Originally formed with eight companies, four of which were based in Suffolk, the battalion was the only eastern cyclist unit. Just two years later in June 1910 the battalion split, with the Suffolk elements forming the 6th (Cyclist) Btn, Suffolk Rgt and Essex elements remaining to form 8th (Cyclist) Btn, Essex Rgt. Therefore, in June 1910, the 6th (Cyclist) Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment was formed with HQ in Ipswich, under command of Lieutenant Colonel W. T. Pretty who joined on 9 August 1911, along with 8 companies:Frederick, Volume I, p. 223.6th (Cyclist) Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment and 358th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, RA at Land Forces of Britain, the Empire, and Commonwealth, Archived on 12 November 2012 at the Wayback Machine.Westlake, The Territorials 1908-1914, p. 19, 56, 106.Drill Hall ProjectHart's Army List, 1913 * Battalion Headquarters at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * A & B Companies at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * C Company at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich with section in Brantham * D Company at St Edmund's Road Drill Hall, Southwold with section in Aldeburgh * E Company at Beccles Road Drill Hall, Lowestoft * F Company at 12 Scales Street Drill Hall, Bungay with section at Pedders Lane Drill Hall, Beccles * G Company at 4 Crowe Street, Stowmarket * H Company at 51 Churchgate Street, Bury St Edmunds * Cadet Corps Affiliation with King Edward's School, Bury St Edmunds == World War I == === Preface === In July 1914 as the international situation worsened, the British Armed Forces were on high alert as the Imperial German Army moving towards the neutral nation of the Kingdom of Belgium, in accordance with the Schlieffen Plan. Because the UK protected Belgium through the terms of the Treaty of London, the UK would act as their protector. When German forces crossed the Ardennes into Belgium, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany and later the rest of the Central Powers. Just before mobilisation, the battalion was directly assigned to HQ, Eastern Command as one of the command cyclist units. On 4 August 1914 the 6th (Cyclist) Battalion was embodied and subsequently renamed as the 1/6th (Cyclist) Battalion, in preparation for the formation of the 2/6th (Cyclist) Battalion.Westlake, The Territorials 1914-1918, p. 8.Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 13.6th (Cyclist) Battalion, WW1 Troop Movements and ORBATS for Suffolk Regiment at Forces War Records. === 1/6th (Cyclist) Btn === When the 1/6th (Cyclist) Battalion was formed in August 1914 it was independent under Eastern Command, but when the 1st Mounted Division was formed a short time after mobilisation, the battalion joined along with four local cyclist battalions. Because most of the battalion's recruiting was done in East Suffolk, it became the coastal defence unit for that area while maintaining its divisional role. Only a short time after the 1st Mounted was formed, the battalion was moved to Beccles and consolidated.St Edmundsbury Cronicle, The Early Twentieth Century and its wars 1900-1945.Becke, p. 4. When the 1st Mounted Division consolidated at war stations, the divisional HQ remained at Bury St Edmunds, which was a short drive away from the battalion's location, but this shortly changed when it was moved to Saxmundham just a month later. In February 1915, the Welsh Border Mounted Brigade moved into Beccles and the bicycle battalions in-turn moved to North Walsham. By May 1916 the former 1st Mounted Division was re-organised as the 1st Cyclist Division, the battalion was moved under the 2nd Cyclist Brigade along with the regiments of the 2nd Pembroke Yeomanry, 2nd Royal North Devon Yeomanry, and 2nd Glamorgan Yeomanry. In November 1916, the division was disbanded, and the battalion was again independent, remaining on home service for the remainder of war. Finally, on 13 March 1919 the battalion was disembodied in Saxmundham. === 2/6th (Cyclist) Btn === When the Territorial Force was mobilised and embodied in August 1914, there was a quick movement to form a 'second line' of which those not volunteering for overseas duties could join. The second line also had the task of taking over the role of home defence while at the same time providing and training reinforcements for the original units (1st line). The second line battalions also later had the role of providing coastal patrols.Westlake, Men- at-Arms, pp. 17-8. Just as the 1/6th Btn joined the 1st Mounted Division, the 2/6th (Cyclist) Battalion was formed in Ipswich, and shortly thereafter moved to Louth, Lincolnshire. In early 1915 the battalion was spread in the areas between the towns of Skegness and Sutton-on-Sea providing coastal patrols. The battalion would remain in the area until 11 March 1919 when it moved to and disbanded in Boston. === 3/6th (Cyclist) Btn === In Mid-1915 more duplicates were added, which were designated as 'Third line' units, most of these being absorbed into the senior 3rd line battalions as 'Reserve battalions'. The 3/6th (Cyclist) Battalion was formed in Ipswich in May 1915, but disbanded in March 1916 in-order to augment other units which had their 1st line battalions serving overseas. == Interwar Period == Inter-war period recruitment poster === 11th (Essex and Suffolk) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery === When the Territorial Force units were disbanded or disembodied in 1919, many regiments and battalions were re-constituted the next year in 1920. After being re-constituted, the Territorial Army (TA) was formed, and designated as the successor to the TF. Within the new TA, many regiments (most of them Yeomanry) were converted to artillery, including the 6th Suffolks, therefore on 1 April 1920 the battalion was reconstituted as a medium artillery brigade, becoming the 11th (Essex and Suffolk) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery. Shortly after formation, No.4 Bty joined as a result of the reduction of the East Anglian (Essex) Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery, thus gaining the battalion's Essex connection again. Sometime later that year, the brigade was renamed as the 58th (Essex and Suffolk) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery and subsequently re-organised and absorbing the 1st Field Company, East Anglian Divisional Engineers.The Monthly Army List, December 1919.Frederick, Volume II, p. 735.Litchfield, pp. 5-6, 219, 328, 337, 342. After these small changes, the brigade was now organised as:Frederick, Volume II, pp. 723, 735. * Regimental Headquarters at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * 229 (Suffolk) Battery, Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * 230 (Suffolk) Battery, 51 Churchgate Street, Bury St Edmunds * 231 (Suffolk) Battery, Gainsborough Street Drill Hall, Sudbury * 232 (Essex) Battery, Stratford Green East Artillery House, Stratford === 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery === In 1924 the Royal Garrison Artillery and Royal Field Artillery merged to become the Royal Artillery once again, and the regiment's name was altered in accordance with this change. On 1 October 1932, the regiment's batteries were re-organised with 232 (Essex) Battery converting to 213 (Essex) Bty and transferring to the 85th (East Anglian) Field Bde, and replaced by a new 232 (Suffolk) Bty based at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich converted from 410 (Suffolk) Bty, 103rd (Suffolk) Army Bde. As a result of the reductions in 1932, the regiment was now solely manned by Suffolk members, and the regiment was renamed accordingly to become the 58th (Suffolk) Medium Brigade, Royal Artillery. On 1 November 1938 the regiment was further reduced when 233 (Suffolk) and 234 (Suffolk) Medium Batteries moved to the new 67th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment. That same year, the RA went through name changes as brigades became regiments, thus making the 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery. When the Territorial Army (TA) was doubled in mid 1938, the regiment formed the 67th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, but because recruitment was so successful, extra men moved to the 5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment and 55th (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. When the 67th was formed, the 58th saw 233 (Suffolk) and 234 (Suffolk) Medium Batteries move to the new unit.Regimental notes on attachment to BEF. == World War II == === 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery === ==== Mobilisation ==== Just before the regiment was mobilised for war in September 1939, the regiment was organised into the following:Nominal Roll of R.H.Q., 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment Royal Artillery.The Monthly Army List, September 1939.Medium Regiments at British Artillery in World War 2.58 (Suffolk) Medium Regiment RA (TA) at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 7 January 2009 at the Wayback Machine. * Regimental Headquarters at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * 229 (Suffolk) Medium Battery at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich commanded by Battery Commander Major G.

When the regiment was mobilised, it was equipped with the old BL 8-inch howitzer, and deemed a 'corps medium regiment'. On 14 October the regiment moved to Louisburg South Barracks in Bordon Camp where it continued mobilisation, and shortly gained the rest of their equipment, LAD section, and signal section. After joining, the signal section, was soon detached to Mons Barracks, Aldershot for further mobilisation and training. When troops of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division started to arrive in Aldershot, the regiment was moved to Kingsley where they were joined by their signal section. French General Georges at Bethune, 23 April 1940. ==== Battle of France ==== On 31 December 1939 an advance party led by Lieutenant Diamond, Sergeant Barfield, and Gunner Melville left for France. When the rest of the regiment arrived on 17 January 1940, it moved to Aix-Noulette where it took up defensive positions.Regimental War Diary, 1940. When the regiment moved to France, it was placed under command of CRA, BEF HQ as one of six medium regiments part of this group. When the German Invasion of the Low Countries kicked off on 10 May 1940, the regiment was quickly reassigned to CRA, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, part of II Corps which was in reserve and focused along the River Escaut. On the 17th, orders were given to the regiment to transfer to HQ Medium Artillery, III Corps in preparation for the move into Belgium. On the 18th, the regiment moved into Belgium, but 230 (Suffolk) Bty became independent for reconnaissance before the rest of the unit could move. Because the regiment had been so hastily moved from France, it could only bring 5 guns to bear at a time.GHQ Troops at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 8 June 2010 at the Wayback Machine. On 25 May 1940 the regiment was moved back to Wervicq where it was ordered to destroy its remaining guns and withdraw to Dunkirk. Finally, at 8am on 31 May 1940 the regiment was evacuated back to England with its personnel were spread throughout Southern England.

On the 29th the regiment moved to Southbourne where they were assigned a coastal defence area which was by Sea Croft, Dalmeny Road. This area covered the beach from there to Hengistbury Head. At this point, the regiment was placed under command of CRA, Southern Command along with the 4th, 53rd (London), and 63rd (2nd Midland) Medium Regiments. On 24 August 1942, the Royal Artillery went through organisational changes, one of the new changes was the formation of new 'Army Group Royal Artillery' units which were (roughly) brigade sized artillery commands which could be attached to Corps and Armies/Army Groups. These new groups would command the corps/army medium and heavy artillery troops, thus bringing the corps/army units under a single command.Southern Command RA Troops from Royal Artillery ORBAT, 1940 at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 8 June 2010 at the Wayback Machine.Army Groups, Royal Artillery at Royal Artillery in World War 2.Frederick, Volume II, p. 965. As part of this expansion, each home command was given an army group, one of these new commands was the 1st Army Group Royal Artillery (1st AGRA) formed in Hamilton Park, Glasgow and shortly thereafter assigned to Southern Command. After the movement of this group to Southern England, the regiment was attached along with its fellow artillery regiments. On 5/6 July the regiment moved to the Newbury Racecourse when the coastal defences area was taken over by the 4th Medium Rgt on the 6th. Sometime before December 1942 the regiment moved to Tichborne, Hampshire and was re-equipped with the new BL 5.5-inch medium gun. During their home defence stunt, the regiment participated in the patriotic 'Dig for victory scheme'. This was evident by the regiment usually helping out on the farms near Tichborne Manor, just down the road from where they were stationed (see photo to the left).

One of the new units was the 58th Medium Regiment which arrived by 18 December 1942, and subsequently attached to CRA, First Army, along with its colleagues from the 4th, 5th, and 74th Medium regiments. In January 1943 the 1st AGRA was placed under command of V Corps for the final push in the Tunisian campaign. During the campaign, the 1st AGRA command all the medium regiments which support the corps, and served very well as they pushed north.Joslen, p. 465.1st AGRA at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 23 November 2008 at the Wayback Machine. ==== Italy ==== In October 1943, the group was transported to Southern Italy as part of the last landings of Operation Husky. Although the regiment continued to support V Corps, it was now under the Eighth Army, as they pushed towards Central Italy. The regiment would by engaged in several important battles:The Battle of Garigliano, Assault on the Gothic Line, Battle of the Argenta Gap, and Battle of Padua (part of Operation Grapeshot). When the end of the war came in September 1945, the regiment was based in Austria, where it was placed in suspended animation on 25 March 1946 after a short stint on garrison duties. === 67th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery === ==== Mobilisation ==== When the 58th was reduced to just two batteries in 1938, the regiment's 231 and 232 batteries were reduced to B and D Troops. Just a short while after when the Territorial Army (TA) was expanded following the 1938 Munich Crisis, the batteries were re-formed and assigned to the new 67th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery, which became the 58th's 2nd line regiment.Frederick, Volume II, p. 737.Litchfield, p. 220. When the regiment was fully manned by September 1939, the regiment was organised as such: * Regimental Headquarters at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel H. C. Lowry-Corry, MC * 231 (Suffolk) Medium Battery at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich * 232 (Suffolk) Medium Battery at Woodbridge Road Drill Hall, Ipswich When war was declared on 3 September 1939, the 67th was un-brigaded and assigned to HQ, East Anglia Area, Eastern Command. To make matters worse, the regiment was equipped with the very old World War I era BL 8-inch howitzer, which had just reached its end of service.67 Medium Regiment RA (TA) at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 7 January 2009 at the Wayback Machine. ==== Home Defence ==== 240 (Shropshire) Bty of 51st (Midland) Med Regt during live firing exercises in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The 51st was equipped the same as the 58th and 67th with the BL 5.5-inch medium gun. When the 58th went to France to join the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, the 67th remained independent and began intensive training for a possible deployment to France. Shortly after mid-September, the regiment was assigned to IV Corps, which was assigned to GHQ Home Forces, and mostly based in the East Midlands. Upon joining IV Corps, the regiment was assigned to HQRA Medium Artillery, IV Corps. If the Germans did invade Britain, IV Corps was to move to wherever they landed as part of the reserves.4 Corps at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 2 March 2012 at the Wayback Machine.British Army Order of Battle, 1 September 1940.United Kingdom Administrative Divisions on 1 September 1940. During mid 1941, Middle East Command (ME Cmd) had initiated Operation Crusader which was planned of pushing Axis forces out of Eastern Libya. As the end of this operation came, ME Cmd planned to further continue the operation, but the forces were severely under- manned and under-equipped. One of the main reasons for ME Cmd to finish the operation was because Tripoli would be a massive strategic gain. By early autumn 1941, General Claude John Eyre Auchinleck started already planned a new operation, deemed Operation Acrobat. In-order to prepare for this upcoming operation, the 67th was moved to Egypt but shortly before equipped with the new brand new BL 5.5-inch medium gun, and subsequently assigned GHQ Troop, Western Desert Force.Playfair, Volume III, p. 119. A Section of 4.5 Medium guns near Reigel Ridge, Cyrenaica in May 1942. ==== North Africa Campaign ==== Just two months after the 67th moved to Egypt, the Western Desert Force was renamed as the Eighth Army, and the regiment reassigned accordingly. On 17 February 1942, the regiment was renamed to recount their Suffolk lineage, becoming the 67th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery. On 10 April as the British forces in Eastern Libya were forced back by Rommel's Afrika Korps, and the forces were moved back to a few small positions, including the port city of Tobruk, this operation was deemed Operation Sonnenblume. Originally, British forces were to moved to the garrison at El Agheila, the most favourable position for a defensive line and restricted the 2nd Armoured Division to movement between supply dumps, reducing its limited mobility further due to lack of transport. Although the siege would eventually be broken, and the Allies successful, the regiment would not see this, as it was destroyed shortly before the breakthrough. 5.5-inch guns of 235 and 336 Medium Batteries, Royal Artillery, line up to fire in support of the Rhine crossing. ==== Home Defence ==== On 7 February 1943 in Hunstanton, Norfolk the regiment was reformed by re-designation of RHQ, 167th Field Regiment, and troops provided by a cadre from the 58th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment which included one officer and four ranks. After reforming in Norfolk in early 1943, the regiment was again based on home soil, and subsequently assigned to GHQ Home Forces as a reserve medium regiment. In March 1943, the 3rd Army Group Royal Artillery was formed in Tonbridge, and the regiment assigned in March 1944, at which time the group was attached to MGRA, XII Corps. At this time, the regiment was grouped with the 6th Field, 13th, 59th (4th West Lancashire), 72nd Medium, and 59th Heavy Regiments along with the group's RASC detachment in support of XII Corps. ==== North-West Europe ==== On 6 June 1944 Operation Overlord was launched, or as it was known to the British Operation Neptune, began as the British I and XXX Corps landed on Gold Beach, Juno Beach, and Sword Beach. On the 16th/17th XII Corps and the Canadian Corps landed and moved across the Orne between Caen and Amaye. By June the corps was completely based in the Normandy area, and preparing for Operation Cobra. The regiment then pushed through North-West France towards the Rhine, including taking part in the failed Operation Market Garden where they held the left flank much behind XXX Corps. The regiment then continued to take part in the North-West Europe campaign, including Operation Pheasant, Operation Blackcock, and later the Invasion of Germany.3rd Army Group RA at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 16 March 2012 at the Wayback Machine.12 Corps at Royal Artillery 1939-45, Archived on 24 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine.Ellis, Volume I The regiment's advance eastward would end in September 1945 when Victory in Europe Day came on the 8/9 May 1945. The regiment then remained in Western Germany on occupation duties until 15 January 1946 when it was placed in suspended animation. On 1 January 1947, unlike its other TA counterparts, the regiment was disbanded. == Postwar == Following the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation. On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised Territorial Army (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all Royal Artillery units, both regular and territorial. Following the Royal Artillery's new numbering system, the regiment was granted the number 358 as the medium artillery were granted numbers between 351\u2013368. Therefore, on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed as the 358th (Suffolk) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA) and organised as follows:Frederick, Volume II, p. 1007. * Regimental Headquarters in Ipswich * P Battery (former 229 Bty) in Ipswich * Q Battery (former 230 Bty) in Bury St Edmunds Just three years later, on 9 January 1950, the Royal Artillery faced massive reductions as many regiments merged. One of the new mergers was between the 358th and 308th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, which became the 358th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery, eventually the regiment was further reduced and amalgamated with the Norfolk Yeomanry to form 202 (The Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Battery, Royal Artillery. In 2006, this battery was re-roled to become No. 677 (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Squadron, Army Air Corps, still based in Bury St Edmunds. == Organisations == The organisation of the regiment at different times included: {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" ! colspan=\"\" |Medium Regiment Organisation (War-time) |- | * Regimental Headquarters ** Signal Section, Royal Corps of Signals ** RAF Operators ** Light Aid Detachment, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, later provided by Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers * 1st Battery ** Battery Headquarters ** A Troop (4 guns) ** B Troop (4 guns) * 2nd Battery ** Battery Headquarters ** C Troop (4 guns) ** D Troop (4 guns) |} == Colonels == Honorary Colonels * Position Vacant until 4 May 1922 * Honorary Colonel, The Right Honorable Ernest George Pretyman, appointed 4 May 1922, replaced 10 January 1927 * Battalion Colonel, H.
