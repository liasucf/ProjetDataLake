He was the first fashion designer in the world to use 3D printing in June 2010 and is currently undertaking a research doctorate in how 3D scanning can become integral to the design process.

I love it! I love it!\u201d and bought, what has since become affectionately named 'The Karl Shirt', for his collaborator Amanda Harlech. In February 2016, Lagerfeld continued to show his support for the brand, photographing Jerry Hall in Nabil's pieces as part of V Magazine\u2019s V100 issue.
