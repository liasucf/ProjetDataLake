He made a total of 31 appearances, winning two titles. ==Career== Freire joined Benfica in 1936, making his debut on 25 October, against Belenenses. He was exclusively used in the Campeonato de Lisboa, playing eight games and scoring seven goals. A seldom used player, competition from Gaspar Pinto and El\u00f3i made him a fringe player, appearing in only 10 games from 1938 until 1941. In 1941\u201342, he gained his place in the first team alongside Gaspar Pinto, helping Benfica win the league, making seven appearances. Following another season without receiving playing time in the league, he left the club, with 31 matches played and seven goals. ==Honours== Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1941\u201342 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1939\u201340 ==References== General * Specific Category:1919 births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
