    "text": "The Epistle of Barnabas () is a Greek epistle written between AD 70 and 132. The complete text is preserved in the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus, where it appears immediately after the New Testament and before the Shepherd of Hermas. For several centuries it was one of the \"antilegomena\" writings that some Christians looked on as sacred scripture, while others excluded them. Eusebius of Caesarea classified it as such. It is mentioned in a perhaps third-century list in the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus and in the later Stichometry of Nicephorus appended to the ninth-century Chronography of Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Some early Fathers of the Church ascribed it to the Barnabas who is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, but it is now generally attributed to an otherwise unknown early Christian teacher, perhaps of the same name. It is distinct from the Gospel of Barnabas. == Manuscript tradition == The Codex Sinaiticus contains the Epistle of Barnabas under the heading \u0392\u0391\u03a1\u039d\u0391\u0392\u0391 \u0395\u03a0\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u039b\u0397. beginning at Quire 91, folio 2r, col. 2.Reproduction of Codex Sinaiticus with GO TO (Barnabas) The 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus (S), discovered by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1859 and published by him in 1862, contains a complete text of the Epistle placed after the canonical New Testament and followed by the Shepherd of Hermas. The 11th-century Codex Hierosolymitanus (H), which also includes the Didache, the two Epistles of Clement and the longer version of the Letters of Ignatius of Antioch, is another witness to the full text. It was discovered by Philotheos Bryennios at Constantinople in 1873 and published by him in 1875. Adolf Hilgenfeld used it for his 1877 edition of the Epistle of Barnabas. A family of 10 or 11 manuscripts dependent on the 11th-century Codex Vaticanus graecus 859 (G) contain chapters 5:7b\u221221:9 placed as a continuation of a truncated text of Polycarp's letter to the Philippians (1:1\u20139:2). An old Latin version (L), perhaps of no later than the end of the 4th century, that is preserved in a single 9th-century manuscript (St Petersburg, Q.v.I.39) gives the first 17 chapters (without the Two Ways section of chapters 18 to 21) This is a fairly literal rendering in general, but is sometimes significantly shorter than the Greek text. S and H generally agree on readings. G often agrees with L against S and H. A small papyrus fragment (PSI 757) of the third or fourth century has the first 6 verses of chapter 9, and there are a few fragments in Syriac of chapters 1, 19,20. The writings of Clement of Alexandria give a few brief quotations, as to a smaller extent do Origen, Didymus the Blind and Jerome.James Carleton Paget, \"The Epistle of Barnabas\" in Paul Foster (editor), The Writings of the Apostolic Fathers (Bloomsbury 2007), p. 73James N. Rhodes, The Epistle of Barnabas and the Deuteronomic Tradition (Mohr Siebeck 2004), p. xiiWilliam Wright: A catalogue of the Syriac manuscripts preserved in the Library of the University of Cambridge (Vol. II). Cambridge: University Press 1901, 611. == Status for Christians == Luke 10:16\u221219 The Epistle was attributed to Barnabas, the companion of Paul the Apostle, by Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 \u2013 c. 215) and Origen (c. 184 \u2013 c. 253).Geoffrey W. Bromiley (editor), The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Eerdmans 1979), vol. 1, p. 206 Clement quotes it with phrases such as \"the Apostle Barnabas says\".Stromata, book 2, chapters 6, 7, 15, 18, 20 Origen speaks of it as the General Epistle of Barnabas.Contra Celsum, book 1, chapter 63 Its inclusion in close proximity to the New Testament in the Codex Sinaiticus and the Codex Hierosolymitanus witnesses to the near-canonical authority it held for some Christians, but is evidence of its popularity and usefulness, not necessarily of canonicity.Andreas J. K\u00f6stenberger, Michael J. Kruger, The Heresy of Orthodoxy (Crossway 2010), p. 164Edmon L. Gallagher, John D. Meade, The Biblical Canon Lists from Early Christianity: Texts and Analysis (Oxford University Press 2017), p. 107 Eusebius (260/265 \u2013 339/340), excluded it from \"the accepted books\", classifying it as among the \"rejected\" or \"spurious\" (\u03bd\u03cc\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9) writings, while also applying to it, as to many others, the term \"the disputed books\", but not the description \"the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many\", a class composed of the Epistle of James, the Second Epistle of Peter, and the Second and the Third Epistle of John. As for the Book of Revelation, Eusebius says it was rejected by some but by others placed among the accepted books.Eusebius of Caesarea \u2014 On The Canon of the New Testament In the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus a list, dating from the third or fourth century, of Old Testament and New Testament books mentions, with an indication of doubtful or disputed canonicity, the Epistle of Barnabas along with the Pastor of Hermas, the Acts of Paul and the Apocalypse of Peter.Catalogue inserted in Codex ClaromontanusStichometric list in Codex Claromontanus (about A.D. 400) The Stichometry of Nicephorus, a later list of uncertain date appended to the Chronography of the early 9th century Nikephoros I of Constantinople, puts the Epistle of Barnabas among its four \"disputed\" New Testament works \u2014 along with the Book of Revelation, the Revelation of Peter and the Gospel of the Hebrews \u2014 but not among its seven \"New Testament apocrypha\".The Stichometery of Nicephorus (9th century?)Erwin Preuschen, Analecta (1893), pp. 157\u2212158 == Date of composition == In 16.3\u20134, the Epistle of Barnabas reads: As commonly interpreted, this passage places the Epistle after the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. It also places the Epistle before the Bar Kochba Revolt of AD 132, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. The document must therefore come from the period between the two Jewish revolts. Attempts at identifying a more precise date are conjectures.\"Epistle of Barnabas 16.1-5\" in Judaism and Rome The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica puts the latest possible date at AD 130. and for the actual date of composition gives \"circa AD 100\".\"Types of Biblical Hermeneutics\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Its 1911 edition opted strongly for \"the reign of Vespasian (AD 70-79)\", shortly after the Catholic Encyclopedia had preferred AD 130\u2212131 in an article by Paulin Ladeuze,Paulin Ladeuze, \"Epistle of Barnabas\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) and AD 96\u221298 in an article by John Bertram Peterson.John Bertram Peterson, \"The Apostolic Fathers\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) On a more precise dating within the limits associated with the Jerusalem temple there is thus an \"absence of scholarly consensus\".James N. Rhodes, The Epistle of Barnabas and the Deuteronomic Tradition: Polemics, Paraenesis, and the Legacy of the Golden-calf Incident (Mohr Siebeck 2004), p. 12David Edward Aune, The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature and Rhetoric (Westminster John Knox Press 2003), p. 72Johannes Quasten, Patrology (Christian Classics) vol. 1, p. 90 Jay Curry Treat comments on the absence in the Epistle of Barnabas (except for a possible reference to the phrase \"Many are called, but few are chosen\" in the Gospel according to Matthew) of citations from the New Testament: Helmut Koester considers the Epistle to be earlier than the Gospel of Matthew: in his Introduction to the New Testament he says of the author of the Epistle: \"It cannot be shown that he knew and used the Gospels of the New Testament. On the contrary, what Barnabas presents here is from 'the school of the evangelists'. This demonstrates how the early Christian communities paid special attention to the exploration of Scripture in order to understand and tell the suffering of Jesus. Barnabas still represents the initial stages of the process that is continued in the Gospel of Peter, later in Matthew, and is completed in Justin Martyr.\"Helmut Koester, Introduction to the New Testament (Walter de Gruyter 1995), vol. 2, p. 281; original: Helmut K\u00f6ster, Einf\u00fchrung in das Neue Testament im Rahmen der Religionsgeschichte und Kulturgeschichte der hellenistischen und r\u00f6mischen Zeit (Walter de Gruyter 1980), p. 716 An opposing view is enunciated by Everett Ferguson: \"The language of rebuilding the temple in 16.3\u20135 refers to the spiritual temple of the heart of Gentile believers (any allusion to a physical temple in Jerusalem is doubtful).\" On the date of composition he says: \"The Epistle of Barnabas is usually dated to 130\u2212135, although an earlier date in the late 70s has had its champions, and 96\u221298 is a possibility.\"Everett Ferguson, Encyclopedia of Early Christianity (Routledge 2013), p. 168 == Provenance == The place of origin is generally taken to be Alexandria in Egypt. It is first attested there (by Clement of Alexandria). Its allegorical style points to Alexandria. Barnabas 9:6 mentions idol-worshipping priests as circumcised, a practice in use in Egypt. However, some scholars have suggested an origin in Syria or Asia Minor.Johannes Quasten, Patrology (Christian Classics) vol. 1, p. 89Aune (2003), p. 72 Treat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas:Jay Curry Treat in The Anchor Bible Dictionary (1992) v. 1, p. 613 == Contents == The Epistle of Barnabas has the form not so much of a letter (it lacks indication of identity of sender and addressees) as of a treatise. In this, it is like the Epistle to the Hebrews, which Tertullian ascribed to the apostle BarnabasF.F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Hebrews (Eerdmans 1990), p. 16 and with which it has \"a large amount of superficial resemblance\".H.H.B. Ayles, Destination, Date, and Authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Cambridge University Press 1899), p. 150 On the other hand, it does have some features of an epistolary character,James Carleton Paget, The Epistle of Barnabas: Outlook and Background (Mohr Siebeck 1994), p. 45 and Reidar Hvalvik argues that it is in fact a letter.Reidar Hvalvik, The Struggle for Scripture and Covenant: The Purpose of the Epistle of Barnabas and Jewish-Christian Competition in the Second Century (Mohr Siebeck 1996), pp. 71\u221275 The document can be divided into two parts. Chapters 1\u221217 give a Christ-centred interpretation of the Old Testament, which it says should be understood spiritually, not in line with the literal meaning of its rules on sacrifice (chapter 2: the sacrifice God wants is that of a contrite heart), fasting (3: the fasting God wants is from injustice), circumcision (9), diet (10: rules that really prohibit behaviour such as praying to God only when in need, like swine crying out when hungry but ignoring their master when full, or being predatory like eagle, falcon, kite and crow, etc.; and that command to chew by meditating the cud of the word of the Lord and to divide the hoof by looking for the holy world to come while walking in this world), sabbath (15), and the temple (16). The passion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews, it says, is foreshadowed in the properly understood rituals of the scapegoat (7) and the red heifer (8) and in the posture assumed by Moses in extending his arms (according to the Greek Septuagint text known to the author of the Epistle) in the form of the execution cross, while Joshua, whose name in Greek is \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (Jesus), fought against Amalek (12). The last four chapters, 18\u221221, are a version of The Two Ways teaching that appears also in chapters 1\u22125 of the Didache.James N. Rhodes, The Epistle of Barnabas and the Deuteronomic Tradition: Polemics, Paraenesis, and the Legacy of the Golden-calf Incident (Mohr Siebeck 2004), p. 89Johannes Quasten, Patrology (Christian Classics) vol. 1, pp. 85\u221286James N. Rhodes, \"Barnabas, Epistle of\" in New Catholic Encyclopedia As viewed by Andrew Louth, the author \"is simply concerned to show that the Old Testament Scriptures are Christian Scriptures and that the spiritual meaning is their real meaning\".Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987), \"real meaning\" As viewed by Bart D. Ehrman, the Epistle of Barnabas is \"more anti-Jewish than anything that did make it into the New Testament\". === Midrash and gematria === According to David Dawson, \"the Jewish mind-set of Barnabas, evident in its choice of images and examples, is unmistakable\". He says that the work's two-part structure, with a distinct second part beginning with chapter 18, and its exegetical method \"provide the most striking evidence of its Jewish perspective. It is presented as a talmud or didach\u0113 ('teaching') divided into haggadah and halakhah. It uses Philonic allegorical techniques to interpret fragments of Septuagint passages, in the manner of the midrashim. Finally, it applies biblical texts to its own contemporary historical situation in a manner reminiscent of the pesher technique found at Qumran.\"David Dawson, Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria (University of California Press 1991), p. 175 The creative interpretation of Bible texts, that is most typically found in rabbinic literature and is known as midrash, appears also in the New Testament and other early Christian works, where it is utilized with the prior assumption that the whole of the Bible relates to Christ.Miguel P\u00e9rez Fern\u00e1ndez, \"Midrash and the New Testament\" in Reimund Bieringer (editor), \"The New Testament and Rabbinic Literature\" (BRILL 2010), p. 367 James L. Bailey judges as correct the classification as midrash of the frequent use by the evangelists of texts from the Hebrew Bible,James L. Bailey, Literary Forms in the New Testament: A Handbook (Westminster John Knox Press 1992), p. 157 and Daniel Boyarin applies this in particular to the Prologue (1:1\u221218) of the Gospel of John.Daniel Boyarin, \"Logos, A Jewish Word: John's Prologue as Midrash\" in Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Zvi Brettler (editor) The Jewish Annotated New Testament (Oxford University Press 2017), pp. 688\u2013691 Other instances of New Testament allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament scriptures as foreshadowing Jesus are , and .\"The Epistle of Barnabas: An Early Example of Allegorical Interpretation of the Old Testament\" (Northern Kentucky University) Other examples of midrash-like exegesis are found in the accounts of the temptation of Christ in Matthew and Luke,Birger Gerhardsson, The Testing of God's Son: (Matt. 4:1-11 & PAR), An Analysis of an Early Christian Midrash (Wipf and Stock 2009), p. 11 and of circumstances surrounding the birth of Jesus. Midrashic presentation of a writer's own views on the basis of the sacred texts was subject to well-established rules but some scholars, due to their failure to recognize the meaning and use of midrash, have evaluated pejoratively the use of scripture by such as Matthew.George Wesley Buchanan, The Gospel of Matthew (Wipf and Stock 2006), p. 26 Similar negative judgments have been expressed on the abundant use of midrashTim Hegedus, \"Midrash and the Letter of Barnabas\" in Biblical Theology Bulletin: Journal of Bible and Culture, volume 38, issue 1 (2007), pp. 20-26Robert A. Kraft, The Epistle of Barnabas: Its quotations and their sources (Harvard University 1961) in the Epistle of Barnabas. In 1867, Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, in their Ante-Nicene Christian Library, disparaged the Epistle for what it called \"the absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture which it suggests\".\"The Epistle of Barnabas\" in Ante-Nicene Christian Library, vol. I (T&T; Clark, Edinburgh 1867) The Epistle of Barnabas also employs another technique of ancient Jewish exegesis, that of gematria, the ascription of religious significance to the numerical value of letters. When applied to letters of the Greek alphabet, it is also called isopsephia. A well-known New Testament instance of its use is in the Book of Revelation, \"Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666\", which is often interpreted as referring to the name \"Nero Caesar\" written in Hebrew characters.Larry W. Hurtado, The Earliest Christian Artifacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins (Eerdmans 2006) The interpretation of Genesis 17:23\u201327 in Barnabas 9:7\u20138 is considered \"a classic example\" of allegorical or midrashic interpretation:Roy B. Zuck, Basic Bible Interpretation: A Practical Guide to Discovering Biblical Truth (David C. Cook 2002), p. 33William W. Klein, Craig L. Blomberg, Robert L. Hubbard, Jr. (editors), Introduction to Biblical Interpretation (Zondervan 2017) \"In reading the story of Abraham circumcising his household, his eye fell on the figure 318 which appeared in the scroll as \u03a4\u0399\u0397. Now \u0399\u0397 was a familiar contraction of the sacred name of Jesus, and is so written in the Alexandrian papyri of the period; and the letter \u03a4 looked like the cross.\"Philip Carrington, The Early Christian Church: Volume 1, The First Christian Church (Cambridge University Press 2011), p. 491 The same gematria was adopted by Clement of Alexandria and by several other Church Fathers: William Barclay notes that, because the letter T is shaped exactly like the crux commissa and because the Greek letter T represented the number 300, \"wherever the fathers came across the number 300 in the Old Testament they took it to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ\".William Barclay, The Apostles' Creed (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), p. 79 Philip Carrington says: \"Barnabas can be artificial, irritating, and censorious; but it would not be fair to judge him by his less fortunate expositions. His interpretation of the unclean beasts and fishes was in line with the thought of his time, being found in the Letter of Aristeas, for instance. His numerology was also a fashionable mode of thought, though the modern scholar is often impatient with it.\" Robert A. Kraft states that some of the materials used by the final editor \"certainly antedate the year 70, and are in some sense 'timeless' traditions of Hellenistic Judaism (e.g., the food law allegories of ch. 10, the Two Ways). It is with such materials that much of the importance of the epistle for our understanding of early Christianity and its late-Jewish heritage rests.\"Robert A. Kraft, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. 3: Barnabas and the Didache The author's style was not a personal foible: in his time it was accepted procedure in general use, although no longer in favour today. Andrew Louth says: \"Barnabas seems strange to modern ears: allegory is out of fashion and there is little else in the epistle. But the fashion that outlaws allegory is quite recent, and fashions change.\"Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987) === Gnosis === In its first chapter, the Epistle states that its intention is that the \"sons and daughters\" to whom it is addressed should have, along with their faith, perfect knowledge.Chapter 1:5 The knowledge (in Greek, \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, gnosis) that the first part (chapters 1\u221217) aims to impart is \"an essentially practical \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, somewhat mystical in character, which seeks to make known the deeper sense of scripture\". The first part, of an exclusively exegetical character, provides a spiritual interpretation of scripture.James Carleton Paget, The Epistle of Barnabas: Outlook and Background (Mohr Siebeck 1994), pp. 46\u221247Richard Patrick Crosland Hanson, Allegory and Event: A Study of the Sources and Significance of Origen's Interpretation of Scripture (Westminster John Knox Press 2002), p. 97Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987), \"gnosis\" The second part opens with a declaration (chapter 18:1) that it is turning to \"another knowledge\" (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). This second gnosis is \"the knowledge of the will of God, the art of enumerating and specifying his commandments, and applying them to various situations\", a halakhic, as opposed to an exegetical, gnosis.Birger A. Pearson, \"Earliest Christianity in Egypt\" in James E. Goehring, Janet A. Timbie (editors), The World of Early Egyptian Christianity (CUA Press 2007), p. 102 The gnosis of the Epistle of Barnabas by no means links it with Gnosticism. On the contrary, it shows \"an implicit anti-Gnostic stance\": \"Barnabas's gnosis can be seen as a precursor of the gnosis of Clement of Alexandria, who distinguished the 'true' gnosis from the 'knowledge falsely so-called' espoused by heretics\". === Scriptural quotations === Contrary to the views of Helmut Koester and Jay Curry Treat, cited above in relation to the date of composition of the Epistle, the authors of The Comprehensive New Testament say the Epistle of Barnabas quotes from the New Testament gospels twice (4:14, 5:9).Clontz, T.E. and J., \"The Comprehensive New Testament\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), On the other hand, the Epistle abundantly cites the Old Testament in the Septuagint version, including therefore the deuterocanonical books. The Old Testament material appears as allusions and paraphrases as well as explicit quotations. However, the work in no way distinguishes its quotations from sacred scripture from its quotations from other works, some of which are now unknown. Thus it is not clear whether material in the Epistle that, though not an exact quotation, resembles 1 Enoch (4:3; 16:5) or 4 Esdras (12:1) attributes to the supposed sources exactly the same status as books now considered canonical. Besides, the Epistle sometimes presents as quotations what are rather free paraphrases, while at other times it gives identifiable phrases without any introductory phrase to indicate that it is quoting.Reidar Hvalvik, The Struggle for Scripture and Covenant: The Purpose of the Epistle of Barnabas and Jewish-Christian Competition in the Second Century (Mohr Siebeck 1996), p. 333 == Notes == == External links == * * Greek text of Epistle of Barnabas * Early Christian Writings: Epistle of Barnabas; e-texts of translations and introductions * Biblicalaudio Letter of Barnabas 2012 Translation & Audio Version *The Epistle of Barnabas: Its Quotations and Their Sources Robert A.
