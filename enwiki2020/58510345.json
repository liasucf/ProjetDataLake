    "text": "John Walker (1878\u20131900) was a Scottish footballer whose position was outside left. He was possibly the first black player to play in both the Scottish Football League and the English Football League, featuring for Leith Athletic and Heart of Midlothian for brief spells in his home country, followed by another short period with Lincoln City in England before returning due to ill health. ==Career== Born in Leith, Walker began his playing career with local Junior team Leith Primrose, moving on to second-tier SFL club Leith Athletic in March 1898.[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 His performances at the end of the 1897\u201398 season and the outset of 1898\u201399 drew the attention of Heart of Midlothian, and he signed for the Tynecastle club in October 1898 for a fee quoted as \u00a350 or \u00a380. He made six Division One appearances for Hearts and featured in an East of Scotland Shield win over local rivals Hibernian, but his overall form did not impress the hierarchy and he was allowed to leave the club at the end of the season. Walker joined Lincoln City of the English Football League Second Division for the 1899\u20131900 season and made six league appearances for the Imps during the first half of the campaign before returning home to Scotland in a poor state of health. ==Personal life== According to the 1881 census, Walker's mother Sarah was born in Leith (one of Scotland's main ports), and his father, also named John, was a dock worker born in \"India, West\" (presumed to be the West Indies). During his playing career he was often referred to by the nickname 'Darkie', although this term did not have the same weight as an insult as in later times. He died of consumption (tuberculosis) in August 1900, aged 22. Walker was not the first black footballer, being preceded by the likes of Robert Walker (no relation), Andrew Watson and Arthur Wharton, but he was among the first to play in the Scottish Football League, and to appear for league clubs in both Scotland and England \u2013 alongside his contemporary Willie Clarke. ==References== ==External links== *Hearts player profile at London Hearts *John Walker, a black professional in the Scottish and English Leagues at scottishsporthistory.com Category:1878 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Scottish footballers Category:People from Leith Category:Footballers from Edinburgh Category:Black Scottish sportspeople Category:Association football wingers Category:Leith Athletic F.C. players Category:Heart of Midlothian F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis ",
