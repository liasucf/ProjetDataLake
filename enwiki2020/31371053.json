    "text": "The Picador painting is a childhood picture painted by the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso in 1889. It is probably one of the earliest existing pictures by him, if not the earliest. The painting depicts a bullfight, an activity which Picasso was already attending at age seven. In 2017, the painting was featured in the exhibition Picasso: Minotaurs and Matadors at the Gagosian Gallery in London. ==References== Category:Paintings by Pablo Picasso Category:1889 paintings ",
