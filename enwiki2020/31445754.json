It set a new long-distance record for a racing pigeon of England. Since the late 20th century, The King of Rome has been the subject of a 1988 song and a 2010 children's book, both by Dave Sudbury. The song's best-known version was recorded by June Tabor, and it has also been covered by American and Canadian singers. In 2013 a radio play by Anthony Atkin and Allison Glossop was broadcast to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the pigeon's record-breaking flight. == The bird == The King of Rome was a racing pigeon that in 1913 won a race from Rome, Italy to England.

It tells how: indicating the dangers related to the pigeons' races. The song was most notably recorded by June Tabor in 1988. She had heard Sudbury perform the song at the Northern Arts Council's 'Songsearch' contest in the late 1980s, where she was a judge. Hudson came in fourth.Sleeve notes, Iain MacKintosh & Brian McNeill, Live and Kicking, 2000 Brian McNeill, another finalist at the event, has said: \"'The King of Rome' was head and shoulders above every other song sung on the night, and should have won.\" Tabor then recorded it for her 1988 album Aqaba. McNeill also has performed the song. He made a live recording included on his 2000 album with Iain MacKintosh, Live and Kicking. American folksinger Vance Gilbert recorded the song for his 1994 album Edgewise, and Canadian folk musician Garnet Rogers recorded it for his album Small Victories (1990), and again on his live album Summer Lightning (2004). The band Half Man Half Biscuit also recorded a version of the song for a BBC radio session, though it remains unreleased. At the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2012, The Unthanks performed the song, with accompaniment from the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band. It appears on the 2012 album The Unthanks with Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band. Sudbury also developed his song as a 32-page children's book (2010), with illustrations by Hans Saefkow. Anthony Atkin and Allison Glossop wrote a radio drama, The King of Rome (2013), to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the bird's win.
