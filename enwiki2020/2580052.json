    "text": "Caril\u00f3 (from the Mapuche word \"Green Dune\") is an upscale beach resort town in Argentina. It is situated in a man made forest on the Atlantic coast of the Province of Buenos Aires, approximately 360 km south of Buenos Aires city in the administrative division of Pinamar Partido. Until a few years ago, access to the town was strictly controlled by the ruling authority. Today Caril\u00f3 is publicly accessible, but comparatively high prices ensure that it remains the preserve of the well-heeled. Caril\u00f3 offers a lot of activities to individuals of all ages. The beach town offers sand dunes that attract many tourists for four wheeling. Many hotels and lodges in the area either have All-terrain vehicle, or quads, to rent or are associated with a company on the beach that does it. Dune bashing is a local favorite in the area for tourists and year- round inhabitants. == History == The Caril\u00f3 area was transformed from large desert dunes close to the sea to a huge forest and a beach. In the early 1920s, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Manuel Guerrero started the forestation of the farm called \"Dos Montes\". This farm included a cattle ranch called \"M\u00e9danos\" (Spanish for \"Dunes\") that has a surface of 1.700 ha. Several problems were faced as the lack of transportation and accesses were combined with almost no experience regarding on-sand forestation. Guerrero family decided to keep the forestation up to the sea shore, and included some fruit trees that brought local bird species. In 1935, that new forested area was named \"Caril\u00f3\" that means \"Green Dune\" in Mapuche language. In 1938, the forestation nurseries were moved to the farm \"Dos Montes\". In 1947, More than 660 thousand trees were ready to be planted. In 1948, an estate house called \"Divisadero\" (also \"Casa Grande\") was built over a dune by the sea with the forest behind. During the 1970s, all the forestation nurseries were disabled when the forestland of the total private property of the Guerrero family was completed. The sons of the founder decided to name all the streets of Caril\u00f3, using wild plants/trees - for those streets running perpendicular to the sea - and local bird names - for those that are in parallel to the sea - in alphabetical order. ==Tourist attractions== Caril\u00f3 is a beach town that offers many hotels, lodges, cabins, and summer homes to tourists both from Argentina and elsewhere, rather than having yearlong residents. Since it is a hotspot amongst tourists it offers several activities to visitors. ==Images== File:Carilo Beach.jpg|Quiet seashore File:Downtown Carilo.jpg|Paseo Epuyen File:Carilo Streets.jpg|Street view File:Carilo Forest to enjoy.jpg|Forest view File:Carilo Birds.jpg|Local birds ==External links== *Sociedad de Fomento de Caril\u00f3 Category:Populated places in Buenos Aires Province Category:Populated coastal places in Argentina Category:Seaside resorts in Argentina Category:Populated places established in 1970 ",
