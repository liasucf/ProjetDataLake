The Supreme Administrative Court is composed of the President, the Vice-president and other justices. At present there are nineteen justices serving at the Court.

The Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania, as the supreme judicial institution in administrative cases, develops uniform case-law of administrative courts in interpreting and applying laws and other legal acts. Individuals, persons defending public interest and other persons, defending themselves against unlawful actions of state authorities (officials), usually first apply to courts of the first instance, the decisions of which may then be appealed against the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania.

Persons specified in the Law on Presidential Elections, the Law on Elections to the Seimas, the Law on Referendum and the Law on Elections to Municipal Councils are entitled to file petitions concerning decisions of the Central Electoral Commission directly to the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania.
