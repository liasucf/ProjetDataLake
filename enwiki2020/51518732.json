Some see Crowd Supply's close management of projects as the solution to the fulfillment failure rate of other crowdfunding platforms. The site also serves as an online store for the inventories of successful campaigns. Notable projects from the platform include Andrew Huang's Novena, an open-source laptop. ==Endorsement by Free Software Foundation== In 2015, Crowd Supply became compliant with the Free Software Foundation's Free JavaScript campaign and was endorsed as the FSF's preferred crowdfunding platform. ==References== Category:Crowdfunding platforms of the United States Category:Companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:2012 establishments in Oregon ",
