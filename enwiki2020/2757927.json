    "text": "The N25 road is a national primary road in Ireland, forming the route from Cork to Rosslare Europort via Waterford City. The road is part of the E30 European route and a short section is also part of the E01 European route. It forms part of the proposed Atlantic Corridor route. ==Route== Up to 22 February 2012, the Cork South Ring Road was designated as part of the N25. However, on 23 February, this section of road was redesignated as N40 and hence from this date, the N25 now commences at the Dunkettle Interchange.http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html From the Dunkettle Interchange the N25 commences east as the East Cork Parkway dual- carriageway, with interchanges for Fota Island and C\u00f3bh, and also Carrigtwohill. The next major destination on the route is Midleton. N25 Waterford City bypass The dual-carriageway ends after bypassing Midleton with an ordinary two-lane road continuing east to Youghal. At Youghal a single carriageway bypass was completed in 2003, bringing the road around the west of the town to the northern side of Youghal. Here the road crosses the River Blackwater into County Waterford. Northeast of this, the road was widened as part of the N25 Kinsalebeg project. This consisted of widening of 3.5 kilometers of single carriageway to include a hard shoulder on both sides of the road. The route passes Dungarvan, with a future bypass at preliminary design stage, before reaching Kilmeaden west of Waterford city and onto the Waterford City Bypass. Beginning at Kilmeaden the bypass passes the Woodstown historic settlement, before crossing the River Suir (via a cable stay bridge of about 475m in length) between Gracedieu in County Waterford and Grannagh in County Kilkenny. The bypass meets the M9 Motorway and N24 at the Grannagh interchange, before joining the old N25 east of Slieverue. The bypass connects to the Outer Ring Road and the old N25 via a road known as the Western Link. (The bypass as a whole contains of dual carriageway* and of single carriageway.) The bypass is a tolled road. From Waterford, the N25 moves north to cross the River Barrow into County Wexford further up its estuary bypassing New Ross over Ireland's longest bridge, the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge, since 29 January 2020. East of the town, the N30 diverges and connects northeast to Enniscorthy on the M11 Dublin - Wexford motorway. The N25 continues east to Wexford and meets the end of the N11 road west of the town. The N25 skirts the edge of the town around to the south and passes west of Rosslare to reach Rosslare Harbour. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge, New Ross bypass ==Future developments== Other sections of the route may become motorway. Part of the N25 dual carriageway in Midleton is to have all its junctions grade-separated and all direct accesses removed from the route (by the construction of a parallel road), thus making it suitable for upgrade to motorway status. TII is examining the possibility of a new road from Midleton to Youghal, with route options being investigated. As part of the Atlantic Corridor road scheme the section of road between Waterford and Rosslare Europort will be built as high quality dual carriageway or motorway standard. Some parts are currently in planning and design stages.http://www.transport21.ie/Projects/Roads/N25_Rosslare_to_Waterford.html However, due to deterioration of the Irish economy and the scaling back of the road building programme the proposed 2015 completion date on these projects was not possible. ==Light aircraft crash== On 27 March 2017, a light aircraft crashed in a field adjacent to the road, killing the elderly pilot. It was one of three major aviation incidents involving Ireland in March 2017, with the Coastguard and Wales crash. ==See also== *Roads in Ireland *Motorways in Ireland *National secondary road *Regional road ==References== *Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2006 \u2013 Department of Transport 25 Category:Roads in County Cork Category:Roads in County Waterford Category:Roads in County Wexford Category:Constituent roads of European route E30 ",
