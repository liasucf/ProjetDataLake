After Radio AAHS discontinued operations in January 1998, Children's Broadcasting Corporation, the station's owner, needed programming for the ten CBC-owned and operated Radio AAHS stations until it could find buyers. In February 1998, KCAZ, along with the other nine CBC stations, became an outlet for \"Beat Radio\", which broadcast electronic dance music 12 hours a day until late October 1998. On September 8, 2019, when ESPN Deportes discontinued operations, the station flipped to a Regional Mexican format. As of January 2020, KCZZ has been the third station to play a Regional Mexican format along with KYYS and KDTD after KCTO flipped to an affiliate of Radio Maria. ==References== ==External links== *FCC history card CZZ Category:Johnson County, Kansas Category:Regional Mexican radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in the United States CZZ ",
