It operated under the Sigma name until 1985 and was based in Silverton, Pretoria. Among the vehicles sold were various models of Mazda, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. ==History== The Silverton Assembly Plant was originally built in 1961 for Chrysler, and assembled Chrysler Valiants. Chrysler sold its 25% shareholding in January 1983 with the remaining shares being held by Anglo American. Earlier, Leyland had approached Sigma about using one of its engines for the Rover V8.\"Leyland-Sigma merger talks confirmed', The Star, 12 May 1978 In 1978, there were proposals for Sigma to merge with British Leyland's South African subsidiary in 1979, to form a company called \"Sigma Leyland\", in which Sigma would have 51 per cent of shares and British Leyland 49 per cent.Autocar, Volume 149, 1978, page 19 However, the deal fell through almost immediately.The Economist, Volume 271, Issues 7075-7087, page 91 This left Leyland South Africa without a dealer network. Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn South Africa (PACSA) was taken over by Sigma in early 1979Paratus, Volume 33, South African Defence Force, page 87 and French car production was moved from the former PACSA plant in Natalspruit near Alberton to their \"Sigma Park\" plant east of Pretoria.Industrial South Africa, Industrial Publishing Corporation, 1982, page 97 Sigma's Mazda and Peugeot light commercials were briefly assembled by Sigma Leyland at Blackheath, Cape Town. ==Products== Sigma made great efforts to develop local models, not sold elsewhere in the world. In their first three years, they developed three such models: the Mitsubishi- engined Mazda 323 GLC 1.6, the luxurious Chrysler L-series, and the 2.6-litre Colt Galant. Sigma also sometimes had to choose between Mitsubishi and Mazda products, since the market was limited and local content laws made small production runs uneconomical. For instance, the second generation Mazda Capella was never offered in South Africa, as Sigma chose to build the Colt Galant instead. It is unclear what models were actually assembled at the Silverton Assembly Plant. Some models may have been imported rather than locally assembled. In 1982, models listed for sale were:CAR magazine (South Africa) October 1982 p237 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Model !!

The Canter trucks were then badged as Mitsubishi rather than Peugeot.CAR magazine (South Africa) January 1984 pp205-206 In May 1984, the Mitsubishi Starion EX was added at R31,995.CAR magazine (South Africa) May 1984 p221 ==Successor== In 1984, after undergoing losses over the past two years, Sigma was restructured into a new company known as Amcar.Financial Mail, Volume 93, Part 1, 1984, page 445 The following year, it was merged with Ford South Africa to create the South African Motor Corporation (Pty) Ltd., known as Samcor for short.Press Digest, Issues 72-94, FOSATU, 1985 In 1988, Ford Canada divested its equity interest in Samcor and donated most of it to the Samcor Employees' Trust.South Africa News Update, South African Consulate-General, 1993, page 5 However, Samcor continued to build Ford as well as Mazda and Mitsubishi products.International Motor Business, Volumes 149-152, Economist Intelligence Unit, 1992, page 92 In 1993, with sanctions being lifted in anticipation of the end of apartheid, Ford Motor Company acquired a 45 per cent stake in Samcor. In 2000, it completed a buyout of Samcor shares and renamed the company Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa (FMCSA).Marketing Success Stories, Michael Colin Cant, Ricardo Machado, Oxford University Press, 2002, page 268 As of 2015, FMCSA still operates from the same site in Silverton. ==Slogan== The slogan \"Quality First\" was used in advertising.CAR magazine (South Africa) October 1982, multiple pages ==See also== Samcor == References == Category:Car manufacturers of South Africa Category:Motor vehicle assembly plants in South Africa Category:Organisations based in Pretoria Category:Economy of Gauteng Category:Truck manufacturers of South Africa ",
