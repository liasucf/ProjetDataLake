    "text": "Pozna\u0144 Airline Society Aerotarg (also spelt Aero-Targ) was the first Polish airline. It was founded in Pozna\u0144 on 10 May 1921 mainly in order to serve participants and visitors of the first Pozna\u0144 International Fair. Aerotarg operated the first regular air connection in Poland - the Pozna\u0144-Warsaw route, as well as the international connection between Pozna\u0144 and the Free City of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk). It is considered to be a precursor of the Polish flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines along with other private-owned companies which were merged into the latter in December 1928.http://www.lot.com/Info/PL/aspx/Content__History_List.aspx ==History== The organizing committee of the first Pozna\u0144 Fair (which was later renamed Pozna\u0144 International Fair) decided to set up an air connection between Pozna\u0144, Warsaw and the free city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) to enable a rapid transit of the participants to Pozna\u0144. To do so, on 10 May 1921 the Pozna\u0144 Airline Society Aerotarg was established. The committee allocated 5 million Polish marks to finance this venture. Aerotarg began cooperation with a haulage company from Danzig - Danziger Luftpost which subsequently leased six Junkers F 13 aircraft to the newly created airline. The airline operated its first flight on 29 May, on the day after the opening of the fair, and ceased operation on 16 June. The Polish Post used the airline to send airmail and issued a special series of stamps to allow for it.http://www.stampdomain.com/country/poland/aerotarg/ Altogether the airline carried out 58 flights on the Pozna\u0144-Warsaw route and 30 flights between Pozna\u0144 and Danzig. Around 100 passengers and 3000 kg of parcels were transported. The venture turned out to be unprofitable and the 5 million marks of the seed capital were not returned to the organizers of the fair. ==References== *Janusz \u0141ukaszewicz, Pozna\u0144skie Aero, \"Skrzydlata Polska\", nr 6 (1998), s. 56-57, . ==External links== *Article on the special series of post stamps Category:Airlines established in 1921 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1921 Category:Defunct airlines of Poland Category:LOT Polish Airlines ",
