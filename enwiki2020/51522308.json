    "text": "Hurricane Newton was the first hurricane to make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula since Odile in 2014. The fifteenth named storm and the ninth hurricane of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Newton formed as a tropical depression out of an area of low pressure off of the coast of Mexico on September 4\\. Despite only moderately favorable conditions, the storm quickly intensified while moving north and became a hurricane roughly a day after being designated. Attaining peak intensity early on September 6, Newton then proceeded to make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula shortly afterwards. It quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low on September 7, before dissipating the next day. Ahead of the storm, several preparations were made to avoid a calamity similar to what Odile had caused two years prior. The hurricane was responsible for at least nine deaths, mainly attributed to flooding; and US$95.7 million in damages. == Meteorological history == The origins of Newton can be traced to a tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa on August 25, 2016. Though the wave initially had some deep convection, the showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave decreased significantly after it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean. The wave moved quickly across the tropical Atlantic, reaching the Lesser Antilles four days later and Central America on September 1. The wave moved into the vicinity of a surface trough south of the coast of Mexico on September 3. A low pressure area developed within the wave early on September 4, and associated deep convection became sufficiently organised for the system to be classified as a tropical depression at 1200 UTC that day. Operationally, the NHC did not classify the system as a tropical depression until nine hours later. ==Preparations== Upon the formation of Newton, the government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the western side of Baja California Sur. Upon being named, the hurricane watch was upgraded into a hurricane warning, while a tropical storm warning was briefly issued for Cabo Corrientes. By the afternoon of September 5, tropical storm warnings and watches were issued for much of Sonora and Sinaloa. During the afternoon of September 5, authorities issued a \"yellow\" alert in southern Jalisco, \"green\" alert for the state of Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, northern and central Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, and Michoacan. A blue alert was declared in Guerrero and Baja California. Classes were suspended in Colima, in three municipalities in northern Jalisco, in Baja California Sur, and in Mazaltan. A total of 800 military personnel was deployed, and a plan to designate all tourists in the Baja California Peninsula. A total of 56 shelters were opened across the peninsula, with a net capacity of 16,000; however, only 1,500 used these shelters. ==Impact== Newton near hurricane status and approaching Baja California on September 5 The outer rainbands of Hurricane Newton brought heavy rains to Guerrero and Chiapas that resulted in flooding. Across Chiapas, three people were killed and two others were reported missing. In the capital city of Tuxtla, almost 900 homes were damaged and six were demolished, leaving 3,500 displaced. In Guerrero, a total of 695 homes were flooded and 12 communities were isolated. Due to the flooding, officials evacuated about 150 people in seven shelters. In Petatlan, two people were swept away in a river, one of whom was found alive, but the other one was found dead. Seventy homes were damaged and 200 people were trapped in the resort town of Acapulco, prompting air evacuations via police, marines and the army. Further north, severe flooding was reported in Colima and Jalisco. Two rivers overflowed, resulting in several communities being isolated. The communities of El Sentinel and El Rebalse were the worst affected by the storm. Several people sought shelter in schools and other public spaces. Statewide, 20 families were evacuated because of flooding. While damage near the landfall location was minor, the hurricane's heavy rains deluged the municipality of Mulege. There, power and drinking water access was lost. In the municipality's seat of Santa Rosalia, dozens of houses and vehicles were buried in rocks and debris. Nearby, the communities of San Ignacio and Herocina Mulege were cut off from the outside world due to damage to the Mexican Federal Highway 1. Offshore, in the Gulf of California, a shrimp boat capsized due to rough seas, resulting in five people being swept away. Two dead bodies were later found ashore while the other three were briefly missing. before being reported dead on September 8. Damage across Baja California Sur reached 700 million pesos (US$37 million). Guaymas suffered extensive impacts from the hurricane, with more than 3,000 homes damaged. Total losses in the municipality reached 1.1 billion pesos (US$58 million). The remnants of Newton brought heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States, peaking at at Miller Carr Canyon in southeastern Arizona. Precipitation reached near Texico, New Mexico, the highest in that state. Losses in Kansas were at US$752,100. ==Aftermath== Due to the flooding in Guerrero, 817 troops, 25 radio stations, 24 first aid kits, and 124 automobiles were displaced for cleanup. Following Hurricane Odile in 2014, where extensive post-storm looting was reported, officials guarded numerous shops in the southern portion of the Peninsula to prevent such looting. However, police noted that five people were arrested for trying to loot two convenience stores in Los Cabos. == See also == * List of Baja California Peninsula hurricanes * List of Arizona hurricanes * List of New Mexico hurricanes * Hurricane Henriette (2007) * Tropical Storm Lidia (2017) ==References== ==External links== *The NHC's advisory archive for Hurricane Newton Category:2016 Pacific hurricane season Category:Pacific hurricanes in Mexico Category:Hurricanes in Arizona Category:Hurricanes in New Mexico Hurricane Newton Hurricane Newton Category:Category 1 Pacific hurricanes Newton ",
