    "text": "In engineering, macro-engineering (alternatively known as macroengineering or macro engineering and as mega engineering) is the implementation of extremely large-scale design projects. It can be seen as a branch of civil engineering or structural engineering but just on a very large land area. In particular, macro-engineering is the process of marshaling and managing of resources, technology and public opinion on a large scale to carry out complex tasks that last over a long period. In contrast to conventional engineering projects, macro-engineering projects (called macro-projects or mega-projects) are multidisciplinary, involving collaboration from all fields of study; they involve not only engineers, but scientists, lawyers, industrialists, soldiers and politicians as well. Macro-projects are usually international; they override political boundaries because most countries lack the social, financial or physical ability to undertake them alone. As a consequence, macro-projects have the power to fundamentally transform their areas of focus. Macro-engineering is an evolving field that is only recently receiving attention. Because we routinely deal with challenges that are multinational in scope, such as global warming and pollution, macro-engineering is emerging as a transcendent solution to worldwide problems. Macro-engineering, or mega- engineering, is distinct from megascale engineering which deals with projects on a planetary or stellar scale. Where macro-engineering is currently practical, mega-scale engineering is still within the domain of speculative fiction. ==In reality== Past macro-projects include the construction of the Panama Canal and Suez Canal, the Channel Tunnel and the planned Gibraltar Tunnel, the construction of cross-country oil pipelines, and most recently, a multinational effort to standardize satellite communication. Two intellectual centers focused on macro-engineering theory and practice are the Candida Oancea Institute in Bucharest, Romania, and The Center for Macro Projects and Diplomacy at Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island, United States. ==See also== * Afforestation * Agroforestry * Atlantropa (Gibraltar Dam) * Analog forestry * Bering Strait bridge * Buffer strip * Biomass * Biomass (ecology) * Climate engineering (Geoengineering) * Collaborative innovation network * Deforestation * Deforestation during the Roman period * Ecological engineering * Ecological engineering methods * Ecotechnology * Energy-efficient landscaping * Forest gardening * Forest farming * Great Plains Shelterbelt * Green Wall of China * IBTS Greenhouse * Home gardens * Human ecology * Permaculture * Permaforestry * Proposed sahara forest project * Qattara Depression Project * Red Sea dam * Sand fence * Seawater Greenhouse * Sustainable agriculture * Terraforming * Windbreak * Wildcrafting ==References== * Frank P.
