    "text": "Mikadotrochus beyrichii, common name Beyrich's slit shell, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pleurotomariidae. It was discovered by Dr. Hilgendorf in an ancient Japanese collection. ==Description== The size of the shell varies between 50 mm and 100 mm. The shell has a trochiform shape. It is as high as broad. It has a flat base. It shows moderately numerous spiral lines. It is pale yellow, beautifully flamed with 11 red whorls that are regularly increasing. The penultimate whorl has 8 lirae above, 2 in and 2 under the slit fasciole. These lirae are beset with weak nodules, about 3 times as long (in the direction of the spiral) as high or broad. The body whorl has a blunt angle at its base. This base contains 20 concentric lirae, and in the middle a deep pit or \"false umbilicus\". On the outside it is white, on the inside it is pearly. The thick, pearly columellar margin is S-shaped.G.W. Tryon (1890), Manual of Conchology vol.
