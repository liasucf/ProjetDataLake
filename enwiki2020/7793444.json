    "text": "Pr\u00e9cis is the debut full-length album by Portland, Oregon based musician Benoit Pioulard, released by Kranky on October 16, 2006. == Background == Before the release of this album, Pioulard (born Thomas Meluch) already had a fairly substantial discography. This included many self-released albums on CD-R and cassette, as well as the 7\" EP Enge, which was put out by Moodgadget in 2005. He later signed a deal with Chicago label Kranky, from which this album was released. === Handmade version === An elaborate handmade version of this album was released through his Myspace profile in September 2006. Limited to only 25 copies, this edition had exclusive content not available on the standard release and due to high demand sold out rapidly. == Critical Reaction == Pr\u00e9cis was generally very well received by critics. Stylus Magazine was one of the first publications to review the album, remarking: Allmusic, who named Pioulard a \"Hot Artist\" in December 2006, were also impressed with the album, saying: For other reviews of this album, see external links. ==Track listing== # \"La Guerre de Sept Ans\" \u2013 3:08 # \"Together & Down\" \u2013 3:07 # \"Ext.

It was directed by Adam Hunt and was posted on both Pioulard's Myspace profile and his official website. Themes in the video generally revolve around photography and nature. It shows Pioulard travelling around various locations and taking Polaroid photographs of his surroundings, which then fall to the ground. Featuring a mixture of close-up shots and distant views, it is a hazy, almost dreamlike video that seems to fit with the style of the song and its ephemeric lyrical focus.
