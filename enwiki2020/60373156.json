    "text": "Bugaboo Creek Steakhouse was a Canadian-themed American casual dining restaurant chain, serving American cuisine, based in Mountainside, New Jersey. The restaurant first opened in March 1996. Up until the mid 2010s, it was known for several novel animatronics based on the wildlife of Canada. Animatronics of bulls, buffaloes, or moose trophy head mounts would greet guests and provide entertainment. Other novelty characters such as Timber, The Talking Christmas Tree, would be programmed to tell customers about Canadian history and natural attractions. ==Menu== The menu offered classic steakhouse offerings. Some menu items included steak, burgers, salads, desserts, appetizers, breakfast food (mornings only), seafood, sandwiches, pasta, and other bar food. ==Bankruptcy and closure== In November 2010, Praesidian Capital announced that it is filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed most of its Massachusetts locations. At the time of the announcement, the company had 12 restaurants still in operation after closing 18 restaurants the previous week. Following the bankruptcy, the chain began moving away from the talking animals, shutting down their animatronics while still leaving them up on the walls. On June 29, 2016, the chain completely closed its doors worldwide. == Animatronics == From the time of the chain's opening until the bankruptcy, Bugaboo Creek was known for its novelty animatronics. Among the real mounts of bucks, deer and bears, several recreated mounts would be fitted with robotics to talk and move. Depending on the location, moose or bull mounts would be near the dining tables or at the bar, whereas a constant Bill the Buffalo would watch over the customers coming into the dining room. The characters would break the fourth wall, sardonically referencing their status as perpetually trapped robots, hanging above the guests, who were happily enjoying their meals. Local restaurants would name these animatronics, such as Moxie the Moose or Goose the Moose. Classic flapping fish were included alongside raccoons or weasels who would pop out of wooden barrels. After each restaurant closed, the non-robotic mounts were sold at local auctions, yet the locations of the talking moose and buffaloes are unknown, theorized to have found other homes in other game themed restaurants. ==References== Category:Companies based in Essex County, New Jersey Category:Restaurants in New Jersey Category:Economy of the Northeastern United States Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1996 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 2016 Category:Steakhouses in the United States Category:Defunct restaurant chains in the United States Category:Defunct restaurants in the United States Category:1996 establishments in New Jersey Category:2016 disestablishments in New Jersey Category:Millburn, New Jersey Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 Category:Theme restaurants ",
