    "text": "The gens Pasidiena, occasionally found as Passidiena, and perhaps the same as Passidinia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. It is chiefly known from two individuals who held the consulship during the first century. ==Origin== The morphology of the nomen Pasidienus indicates that the family was probably not of Latin origin. The gentile-forming suffix -enus was typical of names from Picenum and the vicinity, suggesting that the Pasidieni were of Picentine or Umbrian descent. Names of this class were frequently formed from other gentiles.Chase, p. 118. Pasidienus would therefore have been derived from an older nomen, Pasidius, which is indeed found in a number of instances. The suffix -idius was originally used to form gentilicia from cognomina ending in -idus; but as with other gentile-forming suffixes, -idius was stereotyped, and occasionally appears in cases where there is no morphological justification. There is no evidence of a corresponding cognomen, Pasidus.Chase, pp. 121, 122. ==Branches and cognomina== Firmus, referring to someone strong or hardy, is the only surname associated with the Pasidieni.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. firmus. ==Members== * Publius Pasidienus Firmus, proconsul of Bithynia during the reign of Claudius.
