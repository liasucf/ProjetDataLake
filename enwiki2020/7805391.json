    "text": "Orbicules (syn. Ubisch bodies, con-peito grains) are small acellular structures of sporopollenin (known size range from < 1 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm, but usually sub-micrometre) that might occur on the inner tangential and radial walls of tapetal cells. Their function is unclear at this moment. Current consensus is that they are just a by-product of pollen wall sporopollenin synthesis. ==External links== *A photo of Nelumbo orbicules: Category:Plant morphology Category:Plant sexuality Category:Plant reproductive system Category:Pollination ",
