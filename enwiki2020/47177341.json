    "text": "Chasin' the Boogie is the ninth album by American guitarist Tim Sparks, released in 2014. ==Reception== Chasin' the Boogie received consistently favorable reviews. Minneapolis Star Tribune music critic Jon Bream wrote \"Known for ethnic music, Sparks here interprets pop hits (\u201cBoth Sides Now,\u201d \u201cBlue Bayou\u201d) and traditional tunes (\u201cWayfaring Stranger,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away\u201d) with warmth, passion and a remarkable sense of harmony and rhythm. His originals showcase both his virtuosity and creativity.\" Doug Spencer of the Australian radio program The Weekend Planet highly recommended the album, calling it \"mostly closer to home\" and calls Sparks' cover versions \"... highly original new versions\" Music critic James Filkins wrote \"Bluesy, ragtimey, with a good dose of traditional structure and reminiscent of influential guitar phrases and riffs - Sparks' playing will transport you back in time... \"Chasin' the Boogie\" is as ambitious as it is entertaining. If you are new to Tim Sparks this is the perfect place to start.\" ==Track listing== #\"Carolina Blue Guitar\" (Tim Sparks) \u2013 3:09 #\"Chasin' the Boogie\" (Sparks) \u2013 3:10 #\"I'll Fly Away\" (Albert Brumley) \u2013 5:24 #\"Blackbird\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) \u2013 3:07 #\"Reckless Persuasion\" (Sparks) \u2013 3:53 #\"Mr. Bojangles\" (Jerry Jeff Walker) \u2013 3:32 #\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\" (Joseph M.
