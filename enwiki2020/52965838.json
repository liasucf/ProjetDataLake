The forewings are dark fuscous with ochreous-white markings. There is a streak beneath the costa from the base to two-fifths and a fine dorsal streak from near the base to near the tornus. All veins are marked by strong streaks, not quite reaching the margin, posteriorly terminating in a curved submarginal streak which is broadest opposite the apex. A violet-metallic line is found along the termen. The hindwings are dark fuscous, lighter towards the base. There is also a suffused whitish streak along the upper half of the termen.Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. 1906 (2): 191. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1906 Category:Immidae Category:Moths of Asia ",
