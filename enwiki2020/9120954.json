    "text": "In creationism, special creation is a theological doctrine which states that the universe and all life in it originated in its present form by unconditional fiat or divine decree. Catholicism uses the phrase \"special creation\" in two different senses: * to refer to the doctrine of immediate or special creation of each human soul * to refer (in the context of theistic evolution) to the \"special creation of humans\", a point of hominization where evolved near-human animals were given souls by God, and became fully human; this belief is also called by some scholars \"special transformism\" ==Creationism== In the creationist use of the phrase, special creation adheres to a literal interpretation of the account of creation in the Book of Genesis, accepting it as an accurate historical account of the creation of the universe in essentially its present form over the course of six 24-hour days. Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research defined \"special creation\" as being creation using supernatural processes: Dennis Jensen of the American Scientific Affiliation states that special creation means that complex living things did not descend from simpler ones but were created independently.\"Pain, Pleasure and Evolution: An Analysis of Paul Draper's Critique of Theism, Dennis Jensen, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith 51.1 (March 1999): 40-46) James B. Stenson writes that for fundamentalists, special creation follows from a literal reading of the Genesis account; there is a \"special creation\" of each separate kind in six 24-hour days, starting a few thousand years ago.EVOLUTION: A CATHOLIC PERSPECTIVE, James B.

In The Mystery of Life's Origin, Charles B. Thaxton argues for \"Special Creation by a Creator beyond the Cosmos\", and asserts that special creation holds \"that the source that produced life was intelligent\". ==In Catholicism== The Pontifical Biblical Commission issued a decree ratified by Pope Pius X on June 30, 1909, mentioning special creation only in relation to humans, not to the other species. In 2004, the International Theological Commission, then under the presidency of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, published a paper in which it accepts the current scientific accounts of the history of the universe commencing in the Big Bang about 15 billion years ago and of the evolution of all life on earth including humans from the micro organisms commencing about 4 billion years ago. The Vatican teaches that God acted indirectly through causal chains operating from the beginning of cosmic history, which prepared the way for the moment of transition to the spiritual with the special creation of the human soul. This special creation, the Vatican says, established the basis for a divine intimacy which embraces every single human person from the first moment of his or her existence.Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,(July 23rd 2004), International Theological Commission, La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica 2004, IV, 254-286 ==Notes== Category:Young Earth creationism Category:Creationism Category:Creation myths ",
