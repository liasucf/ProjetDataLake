    "text": "Interview 2016 is the second EP by American experimental hip hop group Death Grips, self-released by the band on March 22, 2016. Consisting of six instrumental tracks, the EP acts as a soundtrack album to a previously released interview video with host Matthew Hoffman, which featured the tracks instead of the interview audio. ==Critical reception== Pitchfork Media critic Zoe Camp was positive in her review, stating: \"While MC Ride might be perceived as the alpha and omega of Death Grips, Interview 2016 underscores that [Zach] Hill and [Andy] Morin are quite formidable on their own.\" Camp also thought that the release was \"far more interesting than Fashion Week, a full-length twice its size, and it suggests that Death Grips' strength as an instrumental entity shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Death Grips * MC Ride * Zach Hill * Andy Morin ==References== ==External links== Category:2016 EPs Category:Death Grips albums Category:Instrumental EPs Category:Self-released EPs Category:2016 soundtrack albums ",
