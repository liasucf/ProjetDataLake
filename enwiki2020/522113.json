    "text": "Gordon Leslie Arnold (August 14, 1941 \u2013 October 15, 1997)http://gravelocator.cem.va.gov/ was an American man who claimed to have witnessed the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. On August 27, 1978, The Dallas Morning News published an article by Earl Golz alleging that several \"counterfeit\" agents of the United States Secret Service were in Dealey Plaza shortly before and after the assassination. The following day, the story was reported by the Associated Press and United Press International. According to the report, Arnold and at least four other individuals said they met men who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. Arnold stated that he was attempting to move to the railroad bridge above the triple underpass to film the presidential limousine and motorcade when a man with a badge who said he was with the Secret Service told him that he could not be there (although in a video interview in the 1988 documentary film The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Gordon stated the man identified himself as being with the CIA). According to Arnold in that interview, he moved to a dirt mound in front of the picket fence on the \"grassy knoll\" where he filmed the motorcade as it moved down Elm Street. He described at least one shot as being fired past his left ear from behind, stating that he \"hit the dirt\" after feeling the first just over his left shoulder, and that while lying down his impression was that at least one more shot came from that location, although he said he heard the echoes of gunfire through the Plaza which made it difficult to determine the source of the other shot(s) with certainty. Arnold indicated that he remained lying down for the duration of the shooting until he was confronted by two policemen who confiscated his film and ordered him to leave the area. However, in The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Arnold mentioned that the film was confiscated by a man wearing a policeman's uniform, except with no hat. He suggested that he had been afraid to report the incident due to claims of \"peculiar\" deaths of witnesses to the assassination. According to the report, at the time of the assassination Arnold was a soldier who had just completed basic training and was reporting for duty in Fort Wainwright, Alaska two days later. In 1978, he was an investigator with the Dallas Department of Consumer Affairs. Arnold was later interviewed for The Men Who Killed Kennedy. According to a 2013 article published in the Dallas News, in 1982, Gary Mack, the former curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, initially believed Arnold to be the Badge Man figure in Mary Moorman's polaroid photograph. == External links == * Nowhere Man: The Strange Story of Gordon Arnold. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Military personnel from Dallas Category:United States Army personnel Category:Witnesses to the assassination of John F.
