    "text": "Totally Blonde is a 2001 comedy film written and directed by Andrew Van Slee and starring Krista Allen, Maeve Quinlan and Michael Bubl\u00e9. The musical soundtrack was released as the album Totally Bubl\u00e9. The airhead comedy was Bubl\u00e9's second film, after a bit part as a singer in Duets (2000) starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis, and followed by a role as Hap in The Snow Walker (2003). The soundtrack, which was moderately successful, was soon followed by his first major label release Michael Bubl\u00e9 (2003). ==Plot== Meg Peters just can't seem to find Mr. Right, until one day she bleaches her hair blonde. Men begin to swarm around, but none she feels is Mr. Right until she meets a crooner at a local club (Michael Bubl\u00e9). The plot thickens when she also meets an old high-school friend, now a wealthy hunk (Brody Hutzler). Typical situations follow, such as a scene where she stands up Bubl\u00e9 for a date with Hutzler, and Bubl\u00e9 ends up making out with her girlfriend played by Maeve Quinlan. In the rather contrived ending, everything ends happily. ==Cast== {|class=wikitable |- !Performer!!Role |- |Krista Allen || Meg Peters |- |Maeve Quinlan || Liv Watson |- |Michael Bubl\u00e9 || Van Martin |- |Brody Hutzler || Brad Wilson |- |Mindy Sterling || Ramona |- |Colin Mochrie || Vulcan / Agent / Comic / Drunk |- |Charlene Tilton || Blonde School Director |- |Michael Kagan || Alfred / Mountie / Minister |- |D.C.
