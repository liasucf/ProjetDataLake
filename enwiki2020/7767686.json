A closely related but probably as yet undescribed species in found in Tibet. It is not certain that the Indian specimens belong to Megophrys boettgeri either. The history of this species' discovery is highly international. It was described by George Albert Boulenger, a Belgian zoologist who made his career in the Natural History Museum, London. He named Megophrys boettgeri in honour of Oskar Boettger, a German zoologist, based on specimens collected by Irish ornithologist J. D. La Touche in Guadun village in Wuyishan, Fujian, China. Male Megophrys boettgeri grow to a snout-vent length of about and females to . They are dark grey or brown above, with symmetrical blackish markings and smooth skin with small scattered warts on the head and back. Megophrys boettgeri is a reasonably common species associated with riparian vegetation, hill streams and leaf-litter in evergreen forest habitats. These frogs breed in streams. Tadpoles are in length. ==References== Category:Megophrys Category:Frogs of India Category:Amphibians of China Category:Fauna of Hong Kong Category:Amphibians described in 1899 ",
