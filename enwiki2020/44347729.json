She was laid down on 22 May 1940 as a British N-class destroyer and launched on 25 June 1941 as HMS Nonpareil, but on 27 May 1942, she was transferred to the Royal Dutch Navy. The ship was commissioned in 1942Sources vary on this ship's commissioning date, some authoritative ones quoting October 1942. Since she is reliably listed as an escort for military convoy WS21P, from UK to the Middle East in July and August 1942, completion by June 1942 seems correct. as HNLMS Tjerk Hiddes, named after the 17th century Dutch admiral, Tjerk Hiddes de Vries. Much of her war service was with the Royal Navy and United States Navy in the Indian Ocean and Australia. Following the war, the destroyer was sold to Indonesia and renamed KRI Gadjah Mada. She was scrapped in 1961. ==War service== Acceptance trials started on 6 May; she was commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy service on 27 May and Tjerk Hiddes was allocated to serve with the British Royal Navy's 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Eastern Fleet. At Scapa Flow, in June and early July, she worked-up with the Home Fleet and prepared for foreign service. In mid-July at the Clyde, she joined the escortWS21P's escort also included the cruiser and a sister ship, the Australian destroyer of military convoy WS21P from the Clyde to the Indian Ocean. During the voyage, on 5 August the convoy was augmented by eight ships of Convoy AS4, carrying equipment for the 8th Army in Egypt. On 20 August, Tjerk Hiddes and Nepal left the convoy, sailing to Kilindini, in Kenya. In September, Tjerk Hiddes joined the forces allocated to support landings to complete the occupation of Madagascar (Operation Streamline Jane), which was under the control of Vichy forces, and participated in preparatory exercises. On 9 September she left Kilindini to rendezvous with the assault convoy and its escort The assault convoy's escort included the aircraft carrier , cruisers and . Force M provided cover and control of landings and included battleship , cruisers and , minelayer , monitor , seaplane carrier HMS Albatross, destroyers , , , , and , , , Nepal and , and escort destroyer on passage to Majunga for the landings. The two Dutch destroyers, and Tjerk Hiddes were deployed as screen for HMS Illustrious. On 26\u201327 September, Tjerk Hiddes returned to Kilindini for convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean. (At this time, other vessels of the 7th Flotilla were returning from detached service in Mediterranean.) Escort duties continued through October until her deployment for convoy defence between Sydney and Fremantle, under the control of the United States 7th Fleet. This duty continued until January 1944, but on 4, 11 and 15 December, she made three voyages to evacuate Allied troops and civilians from Timor. Between 18 and 24 February 1943, she was deployed with sister ship Van Galen and cruisers and to escort a troop convoy between Fremantle and Melbourne (Operation Pamphlet; this military convoy was carrying the 9th Australian Division, recalled from the Middle East in response to the apparent Japanese threat to Australia). In January 1944, the Dutch ships Tjerk Hiddes, Van Galen and Tromp were transferred to the Eastern Fleet. On arrival in Trincomalee in February, Tjerk Hiddes rejoined the 7th Destroyer Flotilla for fleet screening and convoy protection duties in the Indian Ocean. From 22 to 24 February, she joined an unsuccessful search for a German blockade runner en route from Japan to GermanyThe search was performed by cruiser with destroyers and Tjerk Hiddes. On 22 March, Tjerk Hiddes deployed with a large fleetOperation Diplomat naval force included the Australian destroyers HMAS Norman, Nepal, Napier and , British destroyers , , and and Dutch destroyers HNLMS Tjerk Hiddes and Van Galen as screen for the capital ships. These were the battlecruiser , battleships and , aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, cruisers , , and Gambia. to practice at-sea refuelling and to rendezvous with the US aircraft carrier . Saratogas role was predominantly to act as a mentor for Commonwealth units intended for service in the western Pacific (as the British Pacific Fleet) with the United States Navy, where these units would have to convert to use American procedures. As a part of the retraining, Commonwealth and United States naval aircraft executed attacks on Japanese oil installations. Apart from the training and the damage thus caused, it was hoped that Japanese forces would be diverted from regions where the Americans planned to take the offensive. Norseman at Scapa Flow, 25 June 1942 Tjerk Hiddes had to return prematurely to Trincomalee on 25 March, with mechanical defects, and remained under repair until June, when she returned to convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean. In October 1944, she returned to the United Kingdom, joining the 8th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth on convoy duties in the Southwest Approaches. She moved to Dundee for a refit from May to August 1945, by which time the war was over. ==Post war== Tjerk Hiddes resumed peace time service with the Royal Netherlands Navy after completion of the refit at Dundee. She returned to the Dutch East Indies, and was transferred to newly independent Indonesia in March 1951. She was renamed KRI Gadjah Mada and became the flagship of the Indonesian Navy. She was removed from the active list in 1961. The ship was scrapped in 1961Colledge, p.445 by F.
