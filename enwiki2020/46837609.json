    "text": "SPECOM was the English acronym for Special Commando or Commando Speciale in French, the elite military unit and Special Operations force of the Royal Lao Armed Forces (commonly known by its French acronym FAR), which operated during the final phase of the Laotian Civil War from 1972 to 1975. ==Origins== In late 1971 construction began on a training centre at Seno, near Savannakhet, to provide Commando instruction for the Royal Lao Army (RLA) newly formed 2nd Strike Division (French: 2\u00e9me Division d'Intervention). The training cadre, consisting of several Laotian graduates of the U.S. Special Forces (USSF) course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in the United States,Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. were converted into the core of an elite Special Commando Company (French: Compagnie Commando Speciale \u2013 CCS) or SPECOM for short, directly under the commanding officer of the 2nd Strike Division, Brigadier general Thao Ty.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960\u201375 (1989), p. 13.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975 (1994), p. 61. Initial progress was rapid and by mid-1972 SPECOM had expanded from a single understrength company to two airborne reconnaissance (recon) companies; a third was raised in mid-1973 when 140 former para-commandos were transferred from the Savannakhet-based irregular Commando Raider Teams (CRTs)Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960\u201375 (1989), pp. 41\u201342, Plate C3.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975 (1994), p. 39. and a heavy weapons company was added, bringing the unit to battalion strength. ==Structure and organization== By early 1974, SPECOM strength reached 412 Officers and enlisted men, all airborne-qualified volunteers, organized into a reinforced battalion comprising one headquarters (HQ), four company HQ sections, three recon companies \u2013 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, each broken into 12-men teams \u2013 and a heavy weapons company (4th).Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. The unit was headquartered in Seno, near Savannakhet and was subordinated to the 2nd Strike Division until the latter formation's disbandment in April of that same year, when the former was transferred to the RLA Airborne Forces command.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Operational history 1972\u201375== The missions performed by SPECOM during its brief existence were varied, ranging from long-range strategic and tactical reconnaissance to deep-penetration raids, pathfinding, crash-site recovery, reinforcement and riot control duties. The first true combat assignment of the SPECOM occurred in late 1972, when they were used to secure a H-34 helicopter crash site north-east of Seno. In the opening months of 1973, SPECOM recon teams were sent to Thakhek to bolster its defences when North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units began pressuring the city. By mid-year elements of the unit were heli-lifted again north-east of Seno to place a listening station near the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the main NVA supply route extended through Laos. A planned SPECOM assault into the national capital Vientiane after renegade Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) officers led by former Brigadier general Thao Ma captured Wattay Airbase in August was cancelled when their coup attempt quickly fell apart.http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_349.shtml Retrieved 30 April 2012. Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 406-407. In April 1974 SPECOM's 2nd recon company was moved to Vientiane to provide VIP security to rightist members of the new coalition government.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ===Disbandement=== In May 1974 the FAR High Command dissolved the ineffective 2nd Strike Division and elements of its three understrength brigades were re- organized into three new parachute battalions (French: Bataillons de Parachutistes \u2013 BP), the 711er, 712e, and 713e BPs grouped into the RLA's 7th Para Brigade raised at Seno. SPECOM was then converted into the brigade's fourth parachute battalion, 714e BP.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960\u201375 (1989), p. 47, Plate G3. Elements of 714e BP were deployed in early 1975 to Thakhek to reinforce local Royal Lao Police (PRL) and RLA infantry units in an unsuccessful attempt to quell pro-communist demonstrations. By May 1975 the 7th Para Brigade was disbanded after Pathet Lao guerrilla forces took control of Vientiane.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Weapons and equipment== The SPECOM used the standard weaponry and equipment of US origin issued to FAR units, complemented by captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms such as AK-47 assault rifles that allowed its personnel to use ammunition retrieved from enemy caches while on operations. The unit also fielded crew-served heavy weapons, such as mortars and recoilless rifles. * Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistol * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistol * TT-33 Pistol * Type 56 assault rifle * Type 56-1 Assault rifle * AKM Assault rifle * M16A1 Assault rifleConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975 (1994), p. 59. * CAR-15 Assault carbine * RPD Light machine gun * Type 56 Light machine gun * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * M60 Light machine gunConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975 (1994), p. 59. * M72 LAW Anti-tank rocket launcher * M79 grenade launcher * XM148 grenade launcherConboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975 (1994), p. 59. * M203 grenade launcher * Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun * Browning M2HB .50 Cal Heavy machine gun * M2 4.2 inch mortar 107 mm * M67 recoilless rifle 90 mm * M18 Claymore anti-personnel mines ==See also== * Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces (LLDB) * Air America (airline) * Commando Raider Teams * Directorate of National Coordination * Laotian Civil War * Lao People's Armed Forces * Khmer Special Forces * Military Region 5 Commandos * Pathet Lao * Royal Lao Armed Forces * Royal Lao Army Airborne * Royal Lao Police * Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) * Vietnam War * Weapons of the Laotian Civil War ==Endnotes== ==References== *Kenneth Conboy and Don Greer, War in Laos 1954\u20131975, Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications, 1994. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960\u201375, Men-at-arms series 217, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991. * Kenneth Conboy with James Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, Boulder CO: Paladin Press, 1995. , 1581605358 ===Further reading=== *Gordon L.
