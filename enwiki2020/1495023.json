    "text": "Redland City, better known as the Redlands and formerly known as Redland Shire, is a local government area located in the southeast of the Brisbane metropolitan area in South East Queensland. With a population of 156,863 in June 2018, the City is spread along the southern coast of Moreton Bay, covering . Its mainland borders the City of Brisbane to the west and north- west, and Logan City to the south-west and south, while its islands are situated north of the City of Gold Coast. Redland attained city status on 15 March 2008, having been a shire since 1949, when it was created by the merger of the former Tingalpa and Cleveland Shires.Queensland State Archives, Search for Agency Details of Redland City Council , Retrieved 7 April 2014 Despite this status, the City consists of largely suburban and coastal communities, featuring a somewhat disjointed urbanisation around major suburbs interspersed with bushland; there is no clear city centre. Large mainland suburbs include Capalaba, Cleveland, Victoria Point, and Redland Bay. The latter is the City's namesake, due to the colour of its fertile soil.David Tuffley, 2007, \"Redland Bay, Australia: Introduction\", Griffith University: , Retrieved 7 September 2015 North Stradbroke Island and smaller nearby islands, most notably those of Southern Moreton Bay, comprise the eastern portion of the Redlands. The City's boundaries correspond to those of the federal division of Bowman. ==History== St Pauls Anglican Church in Cleveland, ca. 1905 Jandai (also known as Janday, Jandewal, Djendewal, Jundai, Goenpul and Jandawal) is one of the Aboriginal languages of the Moreton Bay Region in South-East Queensland. The Jandai language region is centred on Stradbroke Island, which falls within the local government boundaries of Redland City Council. The area now known as the Redlands was initially inhabited by the Jagera, Turrbal, and Quandamooka people. Europeans first entered the Redlands in the late 18th century while mapping Moreton Bay: James Cook made observations of the then-undivided Stradbroke Island; Matthew Flinders landed on Coochiemudlo Island in 1799; and Robert Dixon later surveyed and named much of the area. By the 1840s, the coastal township of Cleveland was in contention to become a major port replacing Brisbane, but was ultimately not chosen due to the region's existing sandbars and shipwrecks, and an unfavourable review from Governor George Gipps during his 1842 visit. Louis Hope and other land purchasers began to develop significant infrastructure at this time. On 11 November 1879, under the Divisional Boards Act 1879, the Tingalpa Division was created to govern the area to the east of metropolitan Brisbane. The area around Cleveland split away to form the Cleveland Division on 30 May 1885. Under the Local Authorities Act 1902, both became Shires on 31 March 1903. The Tingalpa council met at Mount Cotton. On 1 October 1925, a sizeable portion of the Shire of Tingalpa (suburbs west of Tingalpa Creek, including Upper Mount Gravatt and Rochedale) became part of the new City of Brisbane along with 20 other local governments.Queensland Places, \"Tingalpa\", Centre for the Government of Queensland, University of Queensland: , Retrieved 19 May 2015City of Brisbane Act 1924 (accessed 19 May 2015) On 9 December 1948, as part of a major reorganisation of local government in South East Queensland, an Order in Council renamed the Shire of Cleveland to be Shire of Redland and amalgamated part of Shire of Tingalpa into it (the other part of Tingalpa amalgamated to form the Shire of Albert).Queensland Places, \"Redland City\", Centre for the Government of Queensland, University of Queensland: , Retrieved 19 May 2015 The twentieth century saw significant population growth in the Redlands, preceded by the construction of the Cleveland railway line. Peel Island became a leper colony, while North Stradbroke Island became a hub for sand mining, and is also associated with the Indigenous rights movement as the home of poet Oodgeroo Noonuccal and academic Aileen Moreton-Robinson. On 15 March 2008, Redlands was granted city status.Redland City Council, \"Redlands City Community Plan Project Proposal\", 18 March 2008: , Retrieved 19 May 2015The Redland Foundation, \"About Us\": , Retrieved 19 May 2015 In June 2018, the Redland City Council approved a marketing campaign to brand the city as \"Redlands Coast\" with the tagline \"naturally wonderful\".

These are North Stradbroke, Coochiemudlo and the Southern Moreton Bay Islands of Karragarra, Lamb, Russell and Macleay. Tingalpa Creek rises on Mount Cotton, forming Leslie Harrison Dam, and marking the majority of the area's western boundary.Mary Howells, \"Living on the Edge: along Tingalpa Creek a history of Upper Tingalpa, Capalaba and Thorneside\", University of Queensland, 2001: , Retrieved 19 May 2015 ==Environment== Redland City has many immediately recognisable animals and plants such as koalas, migratory shorebirds, flying foxes and scribbly gum forests.
