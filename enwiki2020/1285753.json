    "text": "Captain John Philip Cromwell (September 11, 1901 - November 19, 1943) was the most senior submariner awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II and one of the three submarine officers who received it posthumously. In some ways similar to his fellow honoree, Howard Gilmore, Cromwell consciously chose to sacrifice his own life to safeguard the lives of others, in a combat action which took place in November 1943.Whitman ==Early life and career== Cromwell was born in Henry, Illinois, on September 11, 1901. Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1920, he graduated in June 1924 and served initially in the battleship USS Maryland school and was assigned to during 1927-29\\. He next had three year's diesel engineering instruction, followed by further tours of duty in submarines.US People Lieutenant Cromwell commanded in 1936-37, then served on the staff of Commander Submarine Division 4. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in 1939 and spent two years in Washington, D.C. with the Bureau of Engineering and Bureau of Ships. In May 1941, he became engineer officer for the Pacific Fleet submarine force. ==World War II== During 1942-43, Cromwell commanded Submarine Divisions 203, 44 and 43, flying his pennant in . Following promotion to captain, he went to sea in as prospective commander of a mid-Pacific submarine wolf pack. was commanded by LCDR Fred Connaway, making his first war patrol. If conditions warranted, Cromwell would form a wolfpack with and either or under his direction. As a senior officer, Cromwell was completely familiar with the plans for the upcoming Battle of Tarawa, Operation Galvanic,GALVANIC was scheduled to commence on 20 November with the invasion of Tarawa and Makin Islands by U.S. Marines, closely supported by powerful carrier striking forces. and knew a lot more about ULTRANavy cryptologists were able to read the principal Japanese naval code, JN-25, and decrypted enemy communications were disseminated regularly to higher echelons of the U.S. Fleet as highly-classified intelligence, code-named ULTRA. \u2013 and its source \u2013 than anyone else on . It was Cromwell's first war patrol also. While attacking a Japanese convoy on November 19, 1943, Sculpin was forced to the surface, fatally damaged in a gun battle and abandoned by her surviving crew members. Captain Cromwell, who knew secret details of the impending operation to capture the Gilbert Islands, deliberately remained on board as she sank. For his sacrificial heroism in preventing the enemy from obtaining this information, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor. ==Medal of Honor action== After a brief overhaul, left Pearl Harbor for her ninth war patrol on 5 November 1943. After refueling at Johnston Island on 7 November, she departed for her assigned station northeast of Truk. On 29 November, COMSUBPAC radioed to order CAPT Cromwell to activate the wolfpack. When failed to acknowledge the message, even after several repetitions, she was assumed \u2013 correctly \u2013 to have been lost at sea. It wasn't until after the war that the details of her loss \u2013 and that of John Cromwell \u2013 to enemy action became known from both Japanese sources and surviving crewmembers who had been prisoners of war. had actually arrived on station on 16 November and made radar contact with a large, high-speed convoy on the night of the 18th. After making a fast surface run to get ahead of the quarry, LCDR Connaway submerged for an attack at dawn. As he started his final approach, however, his periscope was spotted by the enemy, and Connaway was forced to take deep and allow the convoy to pass overhead. Then, he surfaced again to attempt another end run in broad daylight. Unfortunately, the Japanese destroyer Yamagumo had lagged behind the convoy specifically to counter such a move and, after forcing Connaway to make a quick dive, dropped a pattern of depth charges that \u2013 unbeknownst to the crew \u2013 damaged the depth gauge. went deep and laid low for several hours. Around noon, Connaway attempted to bring back to periscope depth, seeking another opportunity to attack. However, while coming up, the broken depth gauge stuck at 125 feet, confusing the diving officer, and causing the boat to broach the surface in full view of Yamagumo, which was still patrolling the area. As crash-dived again, the Japanese destroyer dropped a string of 18 depth charges, severely damaging the boat and causing temporary loss of depth control. Numerous leaks developed in the hull, and so much water came on board that the submarine was forced to run at high speed to maintain depth. This invited a second Japanese attack that did even more damage. At this point, Connaway concluded that the only chance of saving his crew was to come to the surface and fight it out there. surfaced, and with decks awash, her crew manned the deck guns. The result of this uneven contest was hardly in doubt. Yamagumo's first salvo hit 's conning tower, killing the entire bridge watch team, including Connaway and his executive and gunnery officers.Nelson John Allen and Joseph Rollie DeFrees (Blair 1975, p. 525) The gun crew died almost instantly from shrapnel. The senior ship's officer surviving, a reserve lieutenant,G. E. Brown, Jr. (Blair 1975 p. 525) ordered the boat scuttled and the crew to abandon ship. This action left CAPT Cromwell facing a fateful choice. With his personal knowledge of both ULTRA and GALVANIC, he realized immediately that to abandon ship and become a prisoner of the Japanese would create a serious danger of compromising these vital secrets to the enemy under the influence of drugs or torture. For this reason, he refused to leave the stricken submarine and gave his life to avoid capture. He and 11 othersEnsign W. M. Fielder, ship's diving officer and ten more, some dead (Blair 1975 p. 525) rode on her final plunge to the bottom, where her secrets would be safe forever. ==After action summary== Forty-two members of Sculpin's crew \u2013 three officers and 39 enlisted men \u2013 were pulled from the sea by the Japanese, though one of the latter, badly wounded, was thrown back.Another wounded crewman wrenched free and hid amongst his crew mates. (Blair 1975 p. 525) The 41 survivors were taken to Truk and interrogated for ten days by Japanese intelligence officers. The group was divided in half for transport back to Japan on two escort carriers \u2013 21 on Chuyo and 20 on . Those on Unyo arrived in Japan in early December and spent the rest of the war working in the Ashio copper mines, after which they were repatriated to tell their story. On the evening of 3 December 1943, 240 miles southeast of Yokosuka \u2013 with some help from ULTRA \u2013 sank Chuyo, and only one of the prisoners on board survived. When the story of John Cromwell's heroic sacrifice was revealed in the accounts of the survivors, COMSUBPAC VADM Charles Lockwood nominated him for the Medal of Honor. The award was approved and presented posthumously to Cromwell's widow after the war. ==Medal of Honor== Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Navy. Born: 11 September 1901, Henry, Ill.
