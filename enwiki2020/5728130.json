    "text": "Sergei Prokofiev's Symphonic Song (), Op. 57, was written in 1933. ==Analysis== Symphonic Song is a work demonstrating Prokofiev's transition from Parisian modernism to Soviet lyricism. Prokofiev had described of it as \"a serious piece of work, and I took great care in choosing the thematic material. It consists of three closely integrated parts.\" Although there is no programme, the mood of the three parts might be defined as: *Darkness: A dark and gloomy theme emerges. Crushing brass chords and eerie string sonorities add tension to the music. *Struggle: The music becomes livelier, but there are still occasional dissonant outbursts. *Achievement: A lyrical melody soars freely, and the music ends in ecstatic triumph. The work lasts around 13 minutes, and is in one continuous movement. ==Instrumentation== The music is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, bass drum, snare drum, tambourine, and strings. ==Premiere== 14/04/1934, Moscow, conducted by Alexander Gauk. ==Recordings== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"800px\" !align=\"center\"|Orchestra !align=\"center\"|Conductor !align=\"center\"|Record Company !align=\"center\"|Year of Recording !align=\"center\"|Format |- |align=\"center\"|Scottish National Orchestra |align=\"center\"|Neeme J\u00e4rvi |align=\"center\"|Chandos Records |align=\"center\"|1989 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|USSR Ministry of Culture State Symphony Orchestra |align=\"center\"|Gennadi Rozhdestvensky |align=\"center\"|Melodiya |align=\"center\"|? |align=\"center\"|LP |- |} ==External links== *Symphonic Song at Prokofiev.org Category:Compositions by Sergei Prokofiev Category:1933 compositions ",
