    "text": "In the area of mathematics known as group theory, the correspondence theorem, sometimes referred to as the fourth isomorphism theoremSome authors use \"fourth isomorphism theorem\" to designate the Zassenhaus lemma; see for example by Alperin & Bell (p. 13) or Depending how one counts the isomorphism theorems, the correspondence theorem can also be called the 3rd isomorphism theorem; see for instance H.E. Rose (2009), p. 78. or the lattice theorem,W.R. Scott: Group Theory, Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 27. states that if N is a normal subgroup of a group G, then there exists a bijection from the set of all subgroups A of G containing N, onto the set of all subgroups of the quotient group G/N. The structure of the subgroups of G/N is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of G containing N, with N collapsed to the identity element. Specifically, if :G is a group, :N is a normal subgroup of G, :\\mathcal{G} is the set of all subgroups A of G such that N\\subseteq A\\subseteq G, and :\\mathcal{N} is the set of all subgroups of G/N, then there is a bijective map \\phi:\\mathcal{G}\\to\\mathcal{N} such that :\\phi(A)=A/N for all A\\in \\mathcal{G}. One further has that if A and B are in \\mathcal{G}, and A' = A/N and B' = B/N, then *A \\subseteq B if and only if A' \\subseteq B'; *if A \\subseteq B then |B:A| = |B':A'|, where |B:A| is the index of A in B (the number of cosets bA of A in B); *\\langle A,B\\rangle / N = \\langle A',B' \\rangle, where \\langle A,B \\rangle is the subgroup of G generated by A\\cup B; * (A\\cap B)/N = A' \\cap B', and * A is a normal subgroup of G if and only if A' is a normal subgroup of G/N. This list is far from exhaustive. In fact, most properties of subgroups are preserved in their images under the bijection onto subgroups of a quotient group. More generally, there is a monotone Galois connection (f^*,f_*) between the lattice of subgroups of G (not necessarily containing N) and the lattice of subgroups of G/N: the lower adjoint of a subgroup H of G is given by f^*(H)=HN/N and the upper adjoint of a subgroup K/N of G/N is a given by f_*(K/N)=K. The associated closure operator on subgroups of G is \\bar H = HN; the associated kernel operator on subgroups of G/N is the identity. Similar results hold for rings, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. == See also == * Modular lattice ==Notes== ==References== Category:Isomorphism theorems ",
