    "text": "The council of the City of Cape Town in the Western Cape, South Africa is elected every five years by a system of mixed-member proportional representation. Half of the councillors are elected by first-past-the-post voting from individual wards, while the other half are appointed from party lists so that the total number of party representatives is proportional to the number of votes received. By-elections are held to replace the councillors elected by wards if a vacancy occurs. ==December 2000 election== thumb|right|Seats in the city council after the 2000 election. Government: Opposition: The current form of the City of Cape Town was created in 2000 by merging the six transitional municipalities in the Cape Town metropolitan area (Cape Town/Central, South Peninsula, Blaauwberg, Tygerberg, Oostenberg and Helderberg) and the overarching Cape Metropolitan Council. The council of the new municipality consisted of 200 members, 100 elected from wards and the other 100 from party lists. The election was held on 5 December 2000; the Democratic Alliance won a majority of 107 seats. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" !colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| City of Cape Town local election, 5 December 2000 |- !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Party !!colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| Votes !!colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| Seats |- !
