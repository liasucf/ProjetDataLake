    "text": "The Jazz Passengers are an American jazz group founded in 1987 by saxophonist Roy Nathanson and trombonist Curtis Fowlkes. The band grew out of a partnership between Nathanson and Fowlkes in 1987, after the two had played with John Lurie's band The Lounge Lizards. Other regular members include vibraphonist Bill Ware, bassist Brad Jones and drummer E. J. Rodriguez; the group has often featured a violinist (Rob Thomas, Jim Nolet or, more recently, Sam Bardfeld). Guitarists Marc Ribot and David Fiuczynski played in earlier formations of the group. The album that is perhaps their masterpiece, the Hal Willner-produced In Love (High Street, 1994), features vocal contributions from Deborah Harry, Jeff Buckley, Jimmy Scott, Bob Dorough and Mavis Staples. Harry later became a regular member of the band, appearing on a number of follow-up albums, including Individually Twisted (which includes a duet with Elvis Costello), Costello also sings on another track without Harry. Recently the Passengers have recorded infrequently as a full ensemble, though the individual bandmembers' recent side projects tend to feature many fellow Passengers, as well as a similarly skewed musical sensibility. In 2005, Nathanson composed a work commemorating the world's oldest object, a 4.404 billion year old zircon found in Australia. The work was performed by The Jazz Passengers at a \"Rock Concert\" held in Madison, Wisconsin in April of that year. == Discography == * 1987 \u2013 Broken Night Red Light (Les Disques du Cr\u00e9puscule) * 1988 \u2013 Deranged and Decomposed (Les Disques du Cr\u00e9puscule) * 1990 \u2013 Implement Yourself (New World) * 1991 \u2013 Live at the Knitting Factory (Knitting Factory) * 1993 \u2013 Plain Old Joe (Allegro/Knitting Factory) * 1994 \u2013 In Love (High Street, Windham Hill) * 1996 \u2013 Individually Twisted (32 Jazz) with Deborah Harry * 1998 \u2013 \"Live\" in Spain (32 Jazz) with Deborah Harry * 2010 \u2013 Reunited (Justin Time) * 2017 - Still Life with Trouble (Enja) == External links == * The Jazz Passengers (Official Website) * \"Jazz Passengers, A Modernist Septet\", by Jon Pareles * \"Jazz and Theater Add Up To a New Form of Vaudeville\", by Peter Watrous * \"The Jazz Passengers Discography at Allmusic\" * The Jazz Passengers Discography at Discogs Category:American jazz ensembles Category:Septets Category:Musical groups established in 1987 Category:Knitting Factory Records artists Category:Windham Hill Records artists Category:Justin Time Records artists Category:Enja Records artists ",
