There are depots for both lines adjacent to the station. The station was opened in 1985, when the section of line L3 between Lesseps and Montbau stations was inaugurated. The line L5 section of the station was opened on 30 July 2010, when the extension from Horta station opened. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Barcelona Metro line 3 stations Category:Barcelona Metro line 5 stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1985 Category:Railway stations opened in 2010 Category:Transport in Horta-Guinard\u00f3 Category:1985 establishments in Spain ",
