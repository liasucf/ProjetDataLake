Bates began her professional career as a social worker in South Central Los Angeles and served as a supervisor and a Deputy Director in the Aged, Blind and Disabled categorical aid programs for the Los Angeles Department of Social Services. Bates said it was this experience as a government bureaucrat that made her realize government's shortcomings and caused her to view some government programs unfavorably. == Political career == === Laguna Niguel === Bates was part of the drive to turn Laguna Niguel into a city. Bates ran for a seat on the new city's first city council in 1989. She was elected the city's first mayor by fellow council members.

While in the Assembly, she served as vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and vice chair of the Assembly Health Committee. She was re-elected in 2000 and 2002.

She served in the Assembly until 2004 due to term limits. === Orange County Board of Supervisors === On January 9, 2007, Bates was sworn-in as an Orange County supervisor. During her tenure, she focused on the county's fiscal outlook, created business/jobs friendly policies, drove on-time delivery of transportation projects, implemented pension and retiree reforms and worked with local groups to protect the county's coastline. === California State Senate === In 2014, Bates was elected to the California State Senate. She became the Minority Leader of the California State Senate on April 12, 2017, becoming only the second woman in the history of the state to lead a party caucus (the other being her predecessor Jean Fuller.) According to her official Senate biography, Bates strongly supports Proposition 13 and opposes California's gas and car tax increase that was enacted in 2017.

The law is intended to \"help non-profits save money, reduce paperwork, and make more efficient use of state resources.\" == Political positions == === Gas taxes === Bates opposed California's 2017 gas and car tax increase (SB 1), calling it a \u201clemon\u201d and writing that \u201cthe big winners of SB1 are bureaucrats who want more money without real accountability and the boosters of high-speed rail whose funding remains untouched.\u201d === High-speed rail === Bates opposes the continued construction of California's high-speed rail project, saying \u201cIt's a boondoggle. At some point you have to pull the plug.\u201d She advocated that the money for high-speed rail be used to fix roads instead. === Sober living homes and residential treatment facilities === Bates authored legislation to require criminal background checks on people owning rehabs and working in the industry. She wants the federal government to give local governments tools to help regulate such facilities. She credited Southern California New Group's \u201cRehab Riviera\u201d coverage for raising greater awareness of the issue. === Opioid crisis === Bates authored bills to address opioid abuse and to improve regulation of facilities that shelter and treat drug addicts. She authored SB 1109 that was signed by Governor Jerry Brown to increase education for people who are prescribed opioids and to increase training for medical professionals. === Public safety === Bates authored legislation to reclassify several offenses as \u201cviolent\u201d felonies to close what she believes are loopholes in state law. She sides with prosecutors arguing that the state's violent felony list could allow some dangerous inmates to walk free. Bates was honored by Crime Victims United of California as one of its legislators of the year. === Education === Bates endorsed California's Proposition 51 of 2016, which authorized $9 billion in bonds to fund improvement and construction of school facilities for K-12 schools and community colleges. She urged Governor Jerry Brown to expedite the issuance of the bonds. === Environment === Bates supported SR 35, which \u201csupports the current federal prohibition on new oil or gas drilling in federal waters offshore California.\u201d She also supported SR 73, which urges the federal government to permanently safeguard and protect the Pacific coast's Outer Continental Shelf from new oil and gas leasing. She has publicly stated that \"Sea level rise and coastal erosion are two major threats to California\u2019s coast\" and that \"Legislators must come together to find a consensus on solutions.\" In 2020, Bates voted to support AB 793 (Ting) that was approved by Governor Newsom, which mandates plastic beverage bottles must contain on average 50 percent recycled plastic by 2030. The executive director of Californians Against Waste, a Sacramento-based environmental group, called AB 793 the \u201cmost ambitious, aggressive recycled plastics content law in the world.\u201d An article in the San Jose Mercury News described AB 793 as \u201camong the most significant environmental laws that passed this year.\u201d Bates also voted for two other measures approved by Governor Newsom: AB 2762 (Muratsuchi) that bans 24 toxic chemicals in cosmetics, which are linked to negative long-term health impacts, and SB 312 (Leyva) that requires companies selling beauty or personal care products to report the presence of hazardous ingredients. === Health care === Bates opposed a bill that would establish a single-payer health care system in California, agreeing with Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon that it was \u201cwoefully incomplete\u201d because it did not address financing and other concerns. She also called the bill \u201ca false promise that would ruin the state\u2019s precarious finances and threaten funding for other critical priorities.\u201d She said the \u201cLegislature should refocus its efforts on improving existing health programs and on helping those who do not have access to necessary care.\u201d In 2015, Bates introduced legislation to allow Saddleback Memorial Medical Center's San Clemente campus to operate as a stand-alone emergency room in an effort to keep the ER open. === Electric vehicles === Bates has twice supported city plans that serve the needs of electric vehicles. === Net neutrality === Bates opposed net neutrality guidelines proposed in California which would have ensured network providers can't restrict bandwidth to certain services or websites. She stated these guidelines should be left to the federal government. === Trump === Bates endorsed Marco Rubio as the 2016 GOP presidential candidate and served as a \"California co-chair,\" stating that \"he'll make the 'American dream' accessible to everyone.\" She said in early 2016 she would support Trump if he won the GOP nomination. In January 2018, she was quoted as saying that state Democrats were far more focused on opposing the Trump administration than they were on issues important to California, saying state legislators spent \"way too much time focusing on what President Trump and the federal government are doing.\" === Sexual harassment === Bates called on legislative leaders to allow whistleblowers to speak out on sexual harassment by releasing them from non- disclosure agreements. She also called on the Senate and Assembly to convene both houses\u2019 rules committees \u2014 which act as the chambers\u2019 human resources departments \u2014 to have a \u201ccomprehensive, bicameral and bipartisan review.\u201d === Homelessness === Bates co-authored legislation signed by Governor Brown in 2018 allowing the creation of an Orange County trust to help house homeless people. === Campaign finance === In August 2018, Bates opposed the advancement of a bill giving legislative leaders more campaign cash. In April 2016, she and a former chairman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission advocated for the passage of a bill that \u201cwould bar candidates and elected officials from using money from candidate-controlled committees to promote themselves, their candidacies or the campaigns of others.\u201d In 2017, she co- authored Senate Bill 45 (Mendoza) that prohibits taxpayer-paid mass mailings from being sent to constituents within 60 days preceding an election by or on behalf of a state or local candidate running for office. Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 45 into law. == Personal life == Bates is a Southern California native and grew up in Long Beach, California. She moved to South Orange County four decades ago. Her husband John Bates is a retired architect. They have two adult children and four grandchildren. ==References== == External links == * * Campaign website Category:1939 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:California Republicans Category:California state senators Category:Living people Category:Mayors of places in California Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Orange County Supervisors Category:People from Laguna Niguel, California Category:Women mayors of places in California Category:Women state legislators in California ",
