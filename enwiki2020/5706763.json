    "text": "Boris Evgenievich Kochno or Kokhno (; 3 January 1904 \u2013 8 December 1990) was a Russian poet, dancer and librettist. Kochno was born in Moscow, Russia, on 3 January 1904. His father served as a colonel in the hussars. He studied at the Imperial Lycee in Moscow before emigrating to Paris in 1920. He was close with Karol Szymanowski, who gave him as a gift a Russian translation of the chapter The Symposium from his unpublished novel Efebos.Stephen Downes, \"Eros and Paneuropeanism\", in Harry White and Michael Murphy, eds., Musical Constructions of Nationalism: Essays on the History and Ideology of European Musical Cultute, 1800-1945 (Cork University Press, 2001), 51-71, esp. 52, 66-7 Szymanowski also dedicated four poems to him. In 1920 he became Sergei Diaghilev's secretary, librettist, and eventually main collaborator. They were also briefly lovers. Kochno wrote the libretto of Stravinsky's Mavra (1921), George Auric's Les F\u00e2cheux (1924), Henri Sauguet's La Chatte (1927), and of Sergei Prokofiev's ballet score The Prodigal Son (1929). In 1925, he had an affair with Cole Porter, with whom he carried on a lengthy correspondence. Upon Diaghilev's death, Kochno and Serge Lifar tried but failed to hold the Ballets Russes together. The two inherited part of Diaghilev's archives and collections, which Kochno completed and part of which was acquired by the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France. In 1933 he co-founded, together with George Balanchine, the short-lived but history-making company Les Ballets 1933, which made its debut that summer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. That same year, he and Edward James commissioned Brecht and Weill's last collaboration, The Seven Deadly Sins, which Balanchine produced, directed, and choreographed. At the end of World War II, Kochno entered into a partnership with Roland Petit, with whom he founded the Ballets des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. His later career included a position as ballet director with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where he became an influential figure in post-World War II French ballet. Kochno authored several works, including Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, a record of the Diaghilev era, and Christian B\u00e9rard, a scrapbook of artwork by B\u00e9rard, Kochno's former lover and collaborator, along with reminiscences. He died on 8 December 1990 in Paris following a fall. He was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris, next to Wladimir Augenblick (1911\u20132001). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Musicians from Moscow Category:Ballets Russes and descendants Category:Ballets Russes dancers Category:1904 births Category:1990 deaths Category:LGBT writers from Russia Category:Ballet librettists Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Russian male poets Category:20th-century Russian writers Category:20th-century poets Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in France Category:Writers from Moscow Category:20th-century Russian male writers Category:LGBT dancers ",
