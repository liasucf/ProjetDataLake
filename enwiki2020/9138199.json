The park will be an upgrade and expansion of the 736.87 km2 (PRO) Palani (Kodaikanal) Wildlife Sanctuary which was to be established in 2008. The park includes about 36% of the in the Palani Hills. The park is located between latitude 10\u00b07' - 10\u00b028' N and longitude 77\u00b016' - 77\u00b046' E. Central location is east northeast of Silver Cascade Waterfall and E X NE of Kodaikanal Lake. ==History== The Palani Hills derive their name from the ancient temple town of Palani (\u0baa\u0bb4\u0ba8\u0bbf in Tamil) located at the northern base of the hills. In 1906, the great undulating plateau on top of the Palanis comprising four forest ranges were consolidated under the Indian Forest Act of 1878 and designated by the British Government as a single reserve forest, from Kodaikanal town to the Kerala state border in the west and the Bodinayakkanur town limits to the south, and given the name of the Ampthill Downs. It was over in extent and about one quarter of it then consisted of sholas and three quarters was open, rolling, grassy downs. The Ampthill Downs area is now named Upper Palani Shola Reserved Forest and totals (36,000 acres) of forest land. It is the largest reserve forest division in the Palani Hills. The core of the proposed Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary awaiting government notification is located in this division. In 1988, the new Kodaikanal-Berijam Wildlife Sanctuary was included in the protected area proposals considered to be of national priority status by the Wildlife Institute of India. In the early 1990s, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department submitted a proposal to the State government to protect much of the Palani Hills by declaring the area a wildlife sanctuary or a national park.The Hindu, Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 16, 02\u201315 August 2003, \"On The Danger List\" by Ian Lockwood, an excellent and comprehensive description of the Palani Hills \"On The Danger List\" The proposed park area includes only reserve forest land. These forests are already among the protected areas of Tamil Nadu. Their upgrade to Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park will increase their IUCN status from level VI - Protected Area with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources to IV - Habitat/Species Management Area or II - National Park and improve the habitat and wildlife conservation of the area. The sanctuary has been under consideration of the Government of India in consultation with the Government of Tamil Nadu since 1999.ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS DEPARTMENT, POLICY NOTE ON FOREST DEPARTMENT 2001-2002, DEMAND NO. 44 - FORESTS AND DEMAND NO.58 - CAPITAL OUTLAY ON FORESTS 9. WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES The actual park boundaries have not been finalized. In 2007, proposals for declaration of Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary were under consideration of the Government. On 13 August 2012, in an apparent change away from plans for notification of parts of the Palani Hills as a separate wildlife sanctuary, the Tamil Nadu Gazette notification attached parts of Kodaikanal and Dindigul divisions of reserve forests to the buffer zone of Annamalai Tiger Reserve. About 5155.42 hectares of forest land belonging to Palani Hills Northern Slope, Andipatty reserve forest, 4,344.53 acres in Kudraiyar block forest and 5,548.49 hectares in Mannavanur Range in Kodaikanal will be included in the buffer zone. The villages and hamlets that now form part of the Palani Hills buffer zone are Poondi, Mannavanur, Kilavarai, Polur, Kavunchi, Kumbur, Kilanavayal, Kukkal, Pazhamputhur and Puthurpuram. The increasingly important economic role of Eco- tourism, including: trekking, hiking, camping, mountaineering, rock climbing and bird watching may help the local populace to welcome this new Protected area. It remains to be seen whether the Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park will stimulate or stifle commercial development and tourism. The decision to finally establish the park must balance short term financial benefits of the status quo versus long term stability of the natural and human community. ==Geography== Escarpment on southern edge of Palani Hills The Palni Hills are an eastward spur of the Western Ghats with a maximum east-west length of , and a north-south width of . Area is . These hills rise in steep escarpments to a high undulating plateau ranging from to over elevation. The western extremity of the park is contiguous with the Manjampatti Valley core area of the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park and with The Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. The Kurinjimala Sanctuary in Kerala borders the southwestern corner of the park.Kurinjimala and Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuaries, Map These Wildlife Sanctuaries are adjacent to the recently established Eravikulam National Park. The park area includes only reserve forest land, including Palni Hills Northern Slope East, Kallar, Palni Hills Southern Slope East, Upper Palni Shola, Allinagaram, and Palni Hills Northern Slope West Reserve Forests in the Dindigul and Kodaikanal Forest Divisions. ==Geology== Perumal Malai in distance seen from Anna Salai, Street bazaar, Kodaikanal, away Vellari Malai Peak, seen from Talinji Village, away 3\\.

Generally, as one proceeds from the Kerala border in the west to the foothills in the east, average rainfall decreases and temperature increases. Compared to the Deccan plateau and the southwestern coastal plains, temperatures vary from moderate to quite cool. In the central Palani Hills at Kodaikanal, during March to May, the temperature range is between . The temperature can rise to a high of . During Dec-Feb it is between . In January, night temperatures sometimes drop below freezing, and thin ice is seen on lake edges in the early morning. The climate of the upper Palnis has four clearly defined seasons: *the dry season, usually between January and March, during which rain is scarce and limited to around 10 rainy days, the air is crisp, dry and cold, and when ground frost occurs; *The warm season of April and May when most tourists arrive for their holiday in the hills and when summer showers and rain may fall on 18 to 20 days; *The Southwest monsoon season extends between June and September, with around 45 days of rainfall spread over the four months; *The Northeast monsoon season from October through early December, when rain is abundant and occurs over 30 or more days. Depending on the timing of the northeast monsoon, the latter half of December may experience a few days of heavy rain or remain completely dry. The average annual rainfall is , mostly during the north-east monsoon.Kodaikanal.org, Kodaikanal climateFalling Rain Genomics, Inc - Kodaikanal ==Tribes== Paliyan woman & children. Nomadic Paliyan tribes people have been seen living in some of the several caves in Manjampatti Valley. Paliyan people can be seen near Kukal Cave. The Tamil speaking Pulayan are referred to as the MalaPulayans, a group categorized as scheduled caste by State government of Tamil Nadu. Their traditional livelihood is foraging yams and small gaming in the nearby forest areas combined with cultivation of several species of minor millets in small plots located near their hamlets to meet their subsistence requirements. They live in small hamlets in huts and government constructed colonies. The sedentary life started with the construction of group houses by the government in the early sixties. The community is vertically divided into two sub divisions called Koora and Kanni, further subdivided into 47 sub sects. Each sub sect is called Kootams, which regulates certain social events. Each kootam has its own deity, which is common to the entire group and once yearly the members of the same kootam assemble to worship the deity.P.Thamizoli, K.Balasubramanian, M.S.Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai and P.Ignatius Prabakar, Department of Anthropology, University of Madras, Chennai (2003) \"Folk Narratives from the Palni Hills: The Pulayans left behind the dead cattle, driven to the mountain\u2019s edge, shown the dry waterhole\" \"Folk Narratives from the Palni Hills...\" Many native tribals in the Palani Hills have partially assimilated modern culture but are marginalized on the fringes of society.

Threatened species in the park area include: Bengal tiger,Indian elephant, Indian leopard, gaur (wild ox), Nilgiri tahr and grizzled giant squirrel. Endangered Bengal tiger populations in the adjacent Project Tiger reserves of Anamalai Tiger Reserve and the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger ReserveProject Tiger, Kalakad - Mundanthurai Reserve Project Tiger in the Agasthyamalai hills could expand back into this area when it is better protected. In February 2010, tigers were sighted in Kodaikanal forests during a six-day carnivore signs survey. A tigress and her cub were spotted playing in the wild. Forest Department officials are studying survey data to estimate the local tiger population based on indirect evidence like pug marks, scats and scratches. Amphibians and reptiles: Several little-known and endemic species of amphibians like Raorchestes dubois, Ghatixalus asterops, Micrixalus nigraventris, Indirana leptodactyla, Nyctibatrachus deccanensis and reptiles like Salea anamallayana, Hemidactylus anamallensis, Kaestlea palnica, Kaestlea travancorica, Ristella rurkii, Platyplectrurus madurensis, Teretrurus rhodogaster, Uropeltis pulneyensis, Uropeltis broughami, Uropeltis woodmasoni, Ahaetulla dispar, Boiga dightoni and Trimeresurus macrolepis occur in this sanctuary. Other more widespread species of herpetofauna also occur lower down. Plants: 'Ceropegia sp.' Moist areas exist along the ravines and in the sheltered pockets of high elevation shola forests around . These sholas are often hotspots of endemic plant life. Notable among these is Pambar Shola. The Pambar Shola, draining to the Pambar River, is now reduced to less than in circumference. It contains several rare and endemic plant species including: Sonerila pulneyensis: a delicate Melastomataceae succulent herb endemic to Pambar Shola, Hoya wightii ssp. pulneyensis: a succulent vine with waxy flowers endemic to Pambar Shola', Plectranthus bourneate: a succulent herb endemic to Pambar Shola, Trichoglottis tenera: an epiphytic orchid.
