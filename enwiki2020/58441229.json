It is situated west of the junction of the A40 and A429 roads in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. A number of springs in the village form the source of the River Leach.Carol Davidson Cragoe, A R J Jurica and Elizabeth Williamson, 'Parishes: Hampnett', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 9, Bradley Hundred. The Northleach Area of the Cotswolds, ed. N M Herbert (London, 2001), pp. 81-91. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/glos/vol9/pp81-91 [accessed 9 September 2018]. ==History== There is some evidence of Roman settlement in the area: a bronze statue of Hercules, now in the Cheltenham museum, was found during excavations in the parish. In 1086, Domesday Book listed 25 tenants in the parish including a priest, at which time it was held by Eldred, Archbishop of York, who had bought it from Earl Godwin in 1061. ===St George's Church=== The parish church of St George is a 12th century Norman church built around 1125. Until around 1740 it was dedicated to St Matthew. Between 1868 and 1871, the incumbent, Rev W Wiggins, had the interior walls stencilled in a colourful medieval style. This was not appreciated by the parishioners who attempted to raise money to have it whitewashed but failed to raise the required amount. It is a Grade I listed building. ==Amenities== The nearest shops are in the market town of Northleach, to the south-east. A once-a-week bus service runs to a supermarket in Cirencester. ==References== Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Civil parishes in Gloucestershire Category:Cotswold District Category:Cotswolds ",
