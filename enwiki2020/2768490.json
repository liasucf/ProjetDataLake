    "text": "Alberto Bayo y Giroud (March 27, 1892 in Camag\u00fcey \u2013 August 4, 1967 in Havana) was a Cuban military leader of the defeated left-wing Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. He was also a poet and essayist. == Biography == He was born in Cuba and studied in the United States and Spain. Bayo's most significant action during the Spanish Civil War was his invasion and retreat from the islands of Ibiza and Majorca. == Activities == In his youth he joined the Spanish Military Aviation. He had his first flight in 1916. He was expelled from the Aviation after taking part in a duel. He was then forced to join the Spanish Legion in 1924, and participated in the Moroccan War, which he stayed for two years as a company commander. In 1925 he was seriously wounded in the groin, spending a year in recovery. In 1926 he requested to return to Africa, and was assigned the 3rd battalion of the Mehal-la de G\u00f3mara - which was part of General Capaz's troops - taking part in heavy fighting until 1927. He returned to the air force during the Second Spanish Republic and was stationed in administrative posts, but he was not promoted. He was appointed as the 2nd Chief of Staff of the V Army Corps for the Battle of Brunete, Modesto, but the commander of the unit opposed this and Bayo was relieved. After that war was lost, Bayo had a furniture factory in Mexico, and is reported to have been an instructor at the Military Academy of Guadalajara. Bayo had contact in Mexico with prominent Latin American revolutionaries, and was associate/mentor of some, including Ernesto Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. While it is not known if he continued contact with Soviet agents such as \"Comandante Carlos Contreras\" (Vittorio Vidali), both were present in Mexico at the same period. == Death == Alberto Bayo died a General of the Cuban Armed Forces. ==Bayo as author and poet== *Cualquier cosilla (poetry), Spain, 1911 *Mis cantos de aspirante (poetry), Spain, 1911 *Cadetadas (poetry), Spain, 1912 *Canciones del Alk\u00e1zar (poetry), Spain, 1914 *Juan de Juanes (novel), Spain, 1926 *Uncida al yugo (novel), Spain, 1926 *Dos a\u00f1os en Gomara, Spain, 1928 *La guerra ser\u00e1 de los guerrilleros, Spain, 1937 *El tenorio laico (poetry), Spain, 1938 *Mi desembarco en Mallorca, Mexico, 1944 *Tempestad en el Caribe, Mexico, 1950 *C\u00e1mara, M\u00e9xico (history), 1951 *El caballero de los tristes destinos (capit\u00e1n Alonso de Ojeda), M\u00e9xico, 1953 *Magallanes, el hombre m\u00e1s audaz de la tierra, Mexico, 1953 *150 preguntas a un guerrillero, Mexico, 1955 *Fidel te espera en la Sierra (poetry), Mexico, 1958 *Mis versos de rebeld\u00eda, Mexico, 1958 *Sangre en Cuba (poetry), Mexico, 1958 *Mi aporte a la revoluci\u00f3n cubana, 1960 *El tenorio cubano (poetry), 1960 *Versos revolucionarios, 130 pp, 1960 *Mis versos, 223 pp, 1965 ==References== ==External links== *Cubaliteraria: Albert Bayo *wannadoo: Alberto Bayo *El Ej\u00e9rcito Popular Republicano *Espa\u00f1a en Guerra (.pdf) *Alberto Bayo: Gerilla Nedir?
