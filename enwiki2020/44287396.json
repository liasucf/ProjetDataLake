The service opened on 7 July 2011 and closed in September 2016, following the withdrawal of state funding. The line operated between and Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, with a total of six stations along the route. The duration of a single ride from start to finish was 16 minutes. The service, announced as part of PAC 2 (the Brazilian federal funding program for infrastructure) consisted of a 2.1 mile gondola line running above the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o group of favelas, and cost 210 million Brazilian reais to build. The decision to fund the construction of the line saw heavy criticism, with local media describing it as a vanity project, with the money potentially being better spent elsewhere. The system received 9000 riders daily whilst in operation. ==History== The service was inaugurated by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Rio de Janeiro State Governor S\u00e9rgio Cabral Filho and Rio de Janeiro City Mayor Eduardo Paes on 7 July 2011. Local residents could apply for a card granting them two free trips a day. Services were suspended in 2016 because the state couldn't pay the consortium anymore. ==Services== The line consisted of six stations between and Palmeiras Station in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela. The 152 gondolas took 16 minutes to traverse the 3.5 km route. ==References== Category:2011 establishments in Brazil Category:Transport in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Aerial tramways in Brazil Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2011 ",
