Brothers Bruto and Poerio Carlo Carpigiani created the \"Gastecnica S.a.s dei fratelli Carpigiani\" in 1944. Carpigiani produced and patented a gelato machine, named \"Autogelatiera\". The Carpigiani soft serve ice cream machines make a fluffy, whippy ice cream due to their clever whipping action, mixing air and ice cream mix, during the ice cream making process. The technological growth in the 1960s brought Carpigiani to become the worldwide leader in the ice cream machinery, with the invention of the \"hard-o-matic\". In 1964 an American secondary company was founded with the name Coldelite U.S.A., in 1971 Carpigiani bought Cattabriga (concurrent firm), in 1989 the Comenda Ali S.p.A. group bought the Carpigiani Bruto S.p.A.
