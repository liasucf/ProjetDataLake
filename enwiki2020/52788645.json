The river is located in the valley between the town of Fauske and the village of Sulitjelma. ==Geography== The Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 River is the main river of the Sulitjelma drainage system. The stretch from its source at Langvatnet (Long Lake) to the village of Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5, where it empties into \u00d8vervatnet (Upper Lake) has been developed into the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 Hydroelectric Power Station. The river has many small tributaries.Norgeskart: Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5elva, Elv Fauske. Norwegian County Road 830 runs parallel to the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 River. The Sulitjelma Line formerly ran along the river. The drainage system is regulated by many hydroelectric stations. The river is long and has a drainage basin of .NVE Atlas. Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat. The river's average discharge is . The river gently flows from Langvatnet, but it has some rapids. The only waterfall is located at contour level ,Bjerkaas, Olav. 1989. Vassdragsrapport \u2013 Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5elva. Oslo: Milj\u00f8verndepartementet. where the river runs through narrow sections with steep hillsides. The river has been seriously affected by pollution. After the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 power plant was built, large quantities of water flowed from Langvatnet down to \u00d8vervatnet, and this has led to less pollution. The lower part of the river supports salmon and has a permanent population of trout. ==Hydroelectricity== There are several hydroelectric power stations on the river operated by Salten Kraftsamband:Salten kraftsamband. V\u00e5re vannkraftverk. *The Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 Hydroelectric Power Station with an installed capacity of 35 MW and an average annual production of 282 GWh *The Lomi Hydroelectric Power Station with an installed capacity of 60 MW and an average annual production of 362 GWh *The Fagerli Hydroelectric Power Station with an installed capacity of 24 MW and an average annual production of 252 GWh *The Daja Hydroelectric Power Station with an installed capacity of 15 MW and an average annual production of 157 GWh In 2013, a concession was requested from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate to build the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 Falls Hydroelectric Power Station. It is planned to have an intake at at the existing threshold in the river. The installed capacity will be about 2.7 MW. According to the plan, the average annual production will be 7.3 GWh. The development will create a further reduction in water flow on a stretch of the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 River. The planned release from the plant is a minimum of in the summer season and in the winter season.NVE: Konsesjonssak, Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5fossen kraftverk. There are also plans to create the Lappland Hydroelectric Power Station, which, if it is realized, will change the flow of water in the Sj\u00f8nst\u00e5 River significantly by drawing large quantities of water from Swedish watercourses into Norway. ==References== Category:Fauske Category:Rivers of Nordland Category:Rivers of Norway ",
