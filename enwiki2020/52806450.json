It was so titled because Song's \"Eastern Capital\" Kaifeng had fallen to the Jin dynasty since the Jingkang incident in 1127. Much of the information appears to be compiled by Wang Cheng's father Wang Shang (\u738b\u8cde), who worked in the editorial office for the Veritable Records during 1142\u201343. ==Contents== The book contains 130 chapters (\u5377): *Chapters 1\u201312: annals of emperors (\u5e1d\u7d00), one chapter each for every Northern Song emperor (from Emperor Taizu of Song to Emperor Qinzong) *Chapters 13\u201317: biographies of imperial relatives (\u4e16\u5bb6) *Chapters 18\u2013122: biographies (\u5217\u50b3), including the empresses *Chapters 123\u2013130: supplementary monographs (\u9644\u9304) about foreign countries: 2 chapters each for Liao dynasty, Jin dynasty, and Western Xia, and 1 chapter each for Tibet (Gusiluo regime) and \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Ng\u00f4 dynasty, \u0110inh dynasty, Early L\u00ea dynasty, and L\u00fd dynasty) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chinese history texts Category:12th-century history books Category:Song dynasty literature Category:1180s books Category:1186 in Asia Category:History books about the Song dynasty ",
