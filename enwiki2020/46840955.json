In 1942, at the age of 19, he moved to Oslo for further education. He studied history and learned several languages: French, English, and Swahili. He was particularly accomplished with languages, especially Swahili, and had a master's degree in Swahili.

H. Elliot 2003. Odd B\u00f8rresen \u2013 80 \u00e5r. Korsets Seier, 22 August. At the time, B\u00f8rresen was engaged to Inger- Marie Bastrup. The day before their departure from Norway was both a wedding and a farewell gathering at the church. Odd was 23 years old, and Inger-Marie was 21. The B\u00f8rresens left as missionaries in 1946 from the Filadelfia Church in Oslo to what was then the Belgian Congo (later Zaire and now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). They were part of the first group of Norwegian missionaries sent to Congo after the Second World War. Both of them worked as schoolteachers. In 1951, the B\u00f8rresens were engaged at a teachers' training school in Lemera near Lake Tanganyika. The teachers' school was a collaborative effort between the Norwegian and Swedish Pentecostal movements. B\u00f8rresen became the director of the school in 1961. In 1964 the family had to evacuate the area when the teachers' school was occupied by rebels led by Pierre Mulele, backed by Che Guevara. The rebels were based in the mountains above the school. The school's students also had to flee, traveling over the mountains to the provincial capital Bukavu. Because of the turbulence in Lemara during the rebellion, it was decided to move the teaching school to Bukavu, where B\u00f8rresen again served as director from 1970 to 1971.Institut Bwindi Bukavu.

In 1977 he received a master's degree in Swahili at Uppsala University, which he earned in conjunction with teaching at Lambertseter High School. B\u00f8rresen held a permanent position at Lambertseter High School, with extended leaves for the periods he spent in Africa; he held this position he held until his retirement. In Norway, Odd B\u00f8rresen was a teacher for the Bible school at Filadelfia Church in Oslo. He also traveled around as a preacher.
