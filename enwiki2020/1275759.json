Pollock, and hanged himself on May 24, over 2 weeks before he was to be executed. The title of the oldest person executed goes instead to Gershon Marx, hanged on May 18, 1905, for murder at age 73.http://www.mail-archive.com/deathpenalty@lists.washlaw.edu/msg01797.html # James Savage, ed., John Winthrop, The History of New England from 1630 to 1649, Vol. 2, (Boston:Little, Brown, 1853), page 324.
