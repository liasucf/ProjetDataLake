    "text": "Greg Gumbel (born May 3, 1946) is an American television sportscaster. He is best known for his various assignments for CBS Sports (most notably, the National Football League, NBA and NCAA basketball). The older brother of news and sportscaster Bryant Gumbel, he became the first African-American (and Creole) announcer to call play-by-play of a major sports championship in the United States when he announced Super Bowl XXXV for the CBS network in 2001. He is of Creole ancestry. Gumbel is currently a play-by-play broadcaster for the NFL on CBS as well as the studio host for CBS' men's college basketball coverage. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Gumbel was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the first child of parents Richard Gumbel, a judge, and Rhea Alice LeCesne. As a young man, Gumbel grew up on Chicago's South Side, where he attended and graduated from De La Salle Institute. Before becoming a broadcaster, Gumbel graduated with a B.A. degree in English from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa where he also played on the baseball team. He also has two sisters, Renee Gumbel-Farrahi and Rhonda Gumbel- Thomas.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1990-07-05-9002250030-story.htmlCBS Indianapolis Colts vs Chicago Bears October 4th 2020 - 6 minutes left in the 3rd ===Career=== In 1973, Greg's brother Bryant, then working as a television sportscaster at KNBC in Los Angeles, informed him that another NBC owned and operated station, WMAQ-TV in Chicago, was auditioning for a sports announcer. At the time, Greg was selling hospital supplies in Detroit. He ultimately got the job, returned to Chicago and worked at WMAQ-TV for seven years. The sportscaster he replaced, Dennis Swanson, went on to become president of ABC Sports. Prior to his rising to prominence at CBS, Gumbel worked for MSG, ESPN, and WFAN radio in New York City. At ESPN, he anchored the show SportsCenter and did \"play-by-play\" for early NBA games. On MSG, Gumbel served as a backup announcer for Marv Albert on New York Knicks broadcasts as well as providing coverage for college basketball. When MSG signed a huge contract to broadcast New York Yankees games in 1989, Gumbel served as host of the pregame and postgame shows. In addition to his MSG duties, he was the host of the first radio morning show on radio station WFAN. ====First CBS stint==== Gumbel's CBS career began with part-time work as an NFL announcer in 1988. Also in 1989, Gumbel began announcing college basketball as well. He became host of The NFL Today (alongside Terry Bradshaw) for the 1990 to 1993 seasons. He also anchored CBS' coverage of Major League Baseball, college football, and, in 1999, CBS' coverage for the Daytona 500. Besides his hosting duties, Gumbel provided play-by-play for the NBA (alongside Quinn Buckner), Major League Baseball including the 1993 American League Championship Series (alongside Jim Kaat), and College World Series baseball. He was the prime time anchor for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games from Lillehammer, Norway and co-anchor for the weekday morning broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics from Albertville, France. ====NBC Sports==== Gumbel moved to NBC in 1994 following CBS' losses of the NFL and Major League Baseball broadcasting contracts (Gumbel's last on-air assignment for CBS was providing play-by-play for the College World Series). While at NBC, Gumbel hosted NBC's coverage of the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He also did play-by-play for the 1995 Major League Baseball National League Division Series and National League Championship Series (on both occasions, teaming with Joe Morgan), did play-by-play for The NBA on NBC, hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, Georgia, hosted the 1995 World Championships of Figure Skating, and served as the studio host for The NFL on NBC. ====Current CBS career==== Gumbel left NBC after the network broadcast of Super Bowl XXXII to return to CBS. His first major assignment was to serve as studio host for the network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA men's basketball tournament, something he continues to do to this day. As CBS had just acquired the rights to NBC's previous NFL package, Gumbel joined the broadcast team as the lead announcer with fellow NBC alumnus Phil Simms as his color man. Gumbel was the lead announcer for the NFL on CBS between 1998 and 2003, calling Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII. For the 2004 NFL season, Gumbel traded positions with Jim Nantz as host of The NFL Today with Nantz taking over as lead announcer. At the end of the 2005 NFL season, Gumbel was replaced as studio host of The NFL Today by James Brown. Gumbel returned to the broadcast booth as the #2 play-by-play man, replacing Dick Enberg, alongside color man Dan Dierdorf until Dierdorf retired after the 2013\u201314 NFL season. Gumbel also worked alongside Trent Green in the #3 team as of 2014. ===Personal life=== Greg, his wife Marcy, brother Bryant, and Greg's married daughter Michelle all reside in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area. ===Politics=== In 1999, Gumbel refused to attend a NASCAR banquet honoring Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on the basis that he disagreed with Thomas' positions on political issues. He has regularly appeared on Howard Stern's radio show. Along similar lines, Gumbel said of Rush Limbaugh, \"I find him someone whose words and opinions I can do without.\" ==Legacy== Gumbel is the third man to serve as both host and play-by-play announcer for Super Bowls (the first two were Dick Enberg and Al Michaels respectively). He hosted Super Bowls XXVI, XXX, and XXXII before calling Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII. Jim Nantz became the fourth man to do so after he called Super Bowl XLI for CBS. During his tenure as the chief anchor of The NFL Today, he served alongside co-anchors Dan Marino, Shannon Sharpe, and Boomer Esiason. The group was known to call him by his nickname \"Gumby\". ==Career timeline== *1979\u20131988: ESPN \u2013 Reporter, Anchor, Play-by-play *1989: MSG Network New York Yankees \u2013 Play-by-play *1989\u20131994: College Basketball on CBS \u2013 Play-by-play *1990\u20131993; 2004\u20132005: The NFL Today \u2013 Studio host *1991: Seattle Mariners Television \u2013 Play-by-play *1992\u20131993: Cleveland Cavaliers Television \u2013 Play-by-Play *1992: Winter Olympics \u2013 Weekend morning host *1994: Winter Olympics \u2013 Primetime host *1994: Major League Baseball All-Star Game \u2013 Host *1994\u20131995: MLB on NBC \u2013 #2 Play-by-play *1994\u20131998: NFL on NBC \u2013 Studio host *1994\u20131998: NBA on NBC \u2013 #2 Play-by-play *1995: World Figure Skating Championships \u2013 Host *1998\u20132004: NFL on CBS \u2013 Lead play-by-play *1998\u2013present: College Basketball on CBS \u2013 Studio host *1990\u20131994; 2000\u20132002: College World Series on CBS \u2013 Play-by-play *2006\u2013present: NFL on CBS \u2013 Play-by-play (2006\u20132013: #2) ==External links== *CBS Sports Team \u2013 CBS SportsLine.com *Issue 44 \u2013 Television Sportscasters (African-American) * ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:African-American sports journalists Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:American sports journalists Category:American television sports announcers Category:American sports radio personalities Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:De La Salle Institute alumni Category:Figure skating commentators Category:Loras College alumni Category:Louisiana Creole people Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Motorsport announcers Category:National Football League announcers Category:Television anchors from New York City Category:New York Giants broadcasters Category:New York Knicks broadcasters Category:New York Yankees broadcasters Category:Olympic Games broadcasters Category:Seattle Mariners broadcasters Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Sportspeople from New Orleans Category:Sportspeople from Orlando, Florida ",
