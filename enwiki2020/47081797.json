In it, Sia repeatedly braves head and face gear that push her to the brink of asphyxiation and facial derangement. The clip was uploaded by Perez Hilton on his blog and was viewed more than 250,000 times in 3 hours. Due to the negative comments about her appearance, Sia blogged about the disappointment of reading this, specifically referencing reading about her snaggletooth (a tooth that is broken or not in alignment with the others). In this blog, she also discussed how the concept of the video developed, how the video was 'fun' \"apart from the whole clothes pegs on my face moment\" but how the video has made her famous as it was pretty much worth it. This blog also uploaded on Perez Hilton's site on 31 July. The clip remains one of her most recognisable clips to date. ==Chart performance== The single \"Buttons\" and the album Some People Have Real Problems both debuted on their respective ARIA charts on the week commencing 6 April 2009. This was a result of a combination of Sia completing her first Australian tour, coupled with television and other appearances (including a gig in Sydney's iTunes store). ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
