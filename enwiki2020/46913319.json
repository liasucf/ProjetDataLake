    "text": "|} The Nottinghamshire Oaks is a Listed flat horse race in Great Britain open to mares and fillies aged four years or older. It is run at Nottingham over a distance of 1 mile 2 furlongs and 50 yards (2,057 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June. The race was run as the Warwickshire Oaks at Warwick over 11 furlongs between 2006 and 2013. It was run at Nottingham in 2014 after a horse had been killed in an accident at a Warwick flat meeting in May. The race was moved permanently, and renamed, from 2015 after Warwick had closed for flat racing. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 2006 | Power Girl | 4 | Jamie Spencer | Paul Cole | 2:16.64 |- | 2007 | Dash To The Front | 4 | Oscar Urbina | James Fanshawe | 2:21.29 |- | 2008 | Ronaldsay | 4 | Richard Hughes | Richard Hannon Sr. | 2:14.98 |- | 2009 | Cassique Lady | 4 | Eddie Ahern | Lucy Wadham | 2:18.84 |- | 2010 | Lady Jane Digby | 5 | Greg Fairley | Mark Johnston | 2:18.67 |- | 2011 | Timepiece | 4 | Tom Queally | Henry Cecil | 2:20.21 |- | 2012 | Set To Music | 4 | Jamie Spencer | Michael Bell | 2:22.34 |- | 2013 | La Arenosa | 4 | Harry Bentley | Saeed bin Suroor | 2:21.22 |- | 2014 | Secret Gesture | 4 | Jamie Spencer | Ralph Beckett | 2:11.24 |- | 2015 | Mutatis Mutandis | 4 | Luke Morris | Ed Walker | 2:09.07 |- | 2016 | Elbereth | 5 | Oisin Murphy | Andrew Balding | 2:11.99 |- | 2017 | Wilamina | 4 | Andrea Atzeni | Martyn Meade | 2:09.67 |- | 2018 | Mia Tesoro | 5 | Stephen Donohoe | Charlie Fellowes | 2:10.38 |- | 2019 | Sun Maiden | 4 | Jim Crowley | Michael Stoute | 2:11.86 |} == See also == *Horse racing in Great Britain *List of British flat horse races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , **, , , Category:Middle distance horse races for fillies and mares Category:Nottingham Racecourse Category:Flat races in Great Britain ",
