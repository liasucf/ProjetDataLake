When that plan was canceled, Haitian president Florvil Hyppolite purchased it and had it brought to Haiti in 1891. The market consists of two iron\u2011framed halls, each, connected by a gate with four domed towers and with a clock on the gate\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. The entire structure is painted red, with green accents. The market has burned several times; after a fire in 2008 it was abandoned. It was then completely destroyed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Designated as a \"historical heritage\" by the ', it was rebuilt and reopened a year after the earthquake, with the financial support Irishman Denis O'Brien, owner of the mobile phone company Digicel, who invested US$12million. Bricks recovered from buildings damaged in the earthquake were reused in reconstruction and the same French corporation that manufactured the original roof tiles made the replacements. The restored market was reopened in 2011 by Bill Clinton, former President of the United States. On 13 February 2018, another fire, thought to have started in a rubbish container, destroyed one of the two halls. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Port-au-Prince Category:Tourist attractions in Port-au-Prince ",
