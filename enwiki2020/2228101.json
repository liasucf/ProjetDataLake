Conductor/composer Robert Hanson was appointed the Orchestra's Associate Conductor in 1974 and Co-Music Director with Hillis in 1983. Hanson became Music Director in 1985, and the Orchestra achieved an artistic and service growth described by the Chicago Tribune as \u201cimpressive.\u201d In 1985 the Orchestra became a fully professional ensemble. In 1988, 1999, 2005 and 2016, the Elgin Symphony Orchestra was named Orchestra of the Year by the Illinois Council of Orchestras. The Orchestra is the first four-time winner of the award recognizing programming excellence, artistic quality and leadership. In 2011 Hanson stepped down as Music Director.
