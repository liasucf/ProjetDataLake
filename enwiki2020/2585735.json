    "text": "\"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna, from her debut studio album Music of the Sun (2005). It was written by Samuel Barnes, Scott La Rock, Makeba Riddick, Jean-Claude Oliver, Lawrence Parker, and produced by Poke & Tone. It was released on August 16, 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\". The song received mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"Pon de Replay\", peaking at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the Pop Songs chart. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Marcus Raboy, was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying several activities, such as dancing and riding jet skis with her friends. ==Background and composition== Following the release and commercial success of \"Pon de Replay\", the lead single from Music of the Sun and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".

However, A. Vishnu of The Hindu had contrasting opinions with regard to Rihanna's vocal performance, writing the song further \"exposes her versatility and vocal range\". A reviewer for Billboard praised the song's composition and beat, writing \"[If It's Lovin' that You Want'] reinforces Rihanna's tropical reggae signature with an itchy hook that, albeit monotonous, cannot miss.\" A reviewer of Take40 and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times were brief in their reviews of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", with the former writing that the song is more \"low-key\" compared to Rihanna's previous release, \"Pon de Replay\", and the latter simply writing that it is a \"pretty good\" song. ==Chart performance== \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, failing to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"Pon de Replay\", only peaking within the top ten of three national charts.

We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball\". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying \"This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean ... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand ...and I'm just [performing] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [some scenes with] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible\". The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson. The video begins with scenes of Rihanna dancing and walking along the beach and riding jet skis with her friends during the first chorus and continues into the first verse.
