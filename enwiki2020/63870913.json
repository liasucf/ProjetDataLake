    "text": "The Safine-ye Solaymani (\"Ship of Solayman\") is a Persian travel account of an embassy sent to the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1685 by Suleiman I (1666\u20131694), King (Shah) of Safavid Iran. The text was written by Mohammad Rabi ibn Mohammad Ebrahim, the secretary of the embassy. The text provides excellent information on Iran's historical and cultural presence in the eastern Indian Ocean region. It also gives many details about Siam's late seventeenth century Iranian community. It is the only extant Persian source for the rich history of Safavid contacts with this particular region of the world. ==Sources== * * * Category:Persian literature Category:Safavid Empire Category:17th century in Siam Category:Iran\u2013Thailand relations Category:Travel books Category:Historiography of Thailand ",
