It became Vandross' second album to chart in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 and was his second album to top the R&B; Albums chart where it spent three weeks. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA, and earned Vandross his third nomination for Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Male, but lost to Marvin Gaye for his song \"Sexual Healing\". The hit \"Since I Lost My Baby\" was originally recorded by the Temptations in 1965, while the \"Having a Party\" part of the opening track was originally recorded by Sam Cooke in 1962. The album's opening track was heard during the opening credits of the 1990 film House Party. Rolling Stone gave the album a four-star rating, describing Vandross as \"the most gifted male pop-soul singer of his generation\". In 2004, singer Lalah Hathaway covered the song \"Forever, for Always, for Love\" for the compilation album Forever, for Always, for Luther. She later included the song on her 2004 third album Outrun the Sky. In the same year Philadelphia rap-duo Young Gunz sampled \"Better Love\" on their top 40 hit \"No Better Love\" ft.
