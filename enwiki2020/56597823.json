    "text": "Conrad Malaspina, also known as L\u2019Antico or The Old was an Italian nobleman who lived in the 12th century.Enrica Salvatori, MALASPINA, Corrado, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 67, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 2006. There is no certainty about Conrad's birthdate but most historians agree that it is around 1180, his death date is also uncertain but it is speculated to be around July 1254. Conrad was the forefather of the \"Spino Secco\" (dried thorn in English) branch of the Malaspina family. Conrad Malaspina's achievements were of fundamental importance for the way Italian territories were shaped. He had very close relationships with Emperor Frederick II as well as many intellectuals and political figures of the time. Coat of arms of the House of Malaspina (Spino Secco) == Biography == He was born approximately around 1180, his father was Obizzo II. He started his diplomatic career in 1198 when he himself confirmed the attornment of the knolls of the \u201cCourt of Gondola\u201d to the city of Piacenza. The juridical procedures needed for this attornment had started to be composed years before by his uncles Alberto Malaspina and Morroello Malaspina. His diplomatic career hence began under the supervision of his uncles, who, until he turned 18, were acting in his name, he also worked alongside his cousins, they were tied by their common ancestor, the marques Obizzo I. In the period they worked together they had an intense diplomatic activity trying to solve the contrasts that arose with the Count-Bishop of the diocese of \u201cLuni\u201d, consequentially they signed agreements with the cities of Genoa, Milan, Piacenza, Tortona and Modena. == The controversy with the Count- Bishop of the diocese of \u201cLuni\u201d == Starting from the last decade of the XIIIth century the Malaspina family began to have some contrasts with the Count- Bishop of the diocese of \u201cLuni\u201d because of the considerable richness in lands they had acquired from the d\u2019Este family, that had previously stolen them from the da Vezzano family. By 1202 a compromise was found: the parties agreed on reciprocal defense within the borders of the diocese of \u201cLuni\u201d as well as the equal division of the contended lands, under the promise that the bishop would pay an initial amount of money plus a yearly tax. == Other Agreements == Between 1210 and 1218 Conrad signed several agreements. Between 1210 and 1212 he signed pacts with Piacenza, Milan and Tortona to ensure the safety of Lombard merchants traveling on the Apennine roads. The Malaspina family was a strong supporter of Emperor Otto von Brunswick in his contrast against pope Innocent the third, Pavia and the marquessate of Monferrato. Even if Emperor Otto von Brunswick lost in the battle of Bouvines in 1214 the Malaspina family kept fighting against Pavia, which was impeding pilgrims from reaching Rome, siding with Milan and afterwards Piacenza. Between 1215 and 1216 Conrad tried to seize some strategic positions on the eastern coast of Liguria thus causing Genoa to react. On both the Genovese and Pavia\u2019s front peace was achieved between 1217 and 1218. == The birth of the \u201cSpino Secco\u201d branch == the city of Mulazzo Between April and August 1221 Conrad and his cousin Obizzo, son of Conrad\u2019s uncle Gugliemo, carried out the first separation of the family\u2019s patrimonial assets. The Malaspina\u2019s family domain was divided in two parts, one belonged to Conrad, who is the founder of the Spino Secco branch, the other belonged to Obizzo, who started the Spino Fiorito branch (Blooming Thorn). Such division was preceded by the preventive splitting of Alberto Malaspina\u2019s heredity between uncle Guglielmo Malaspina and Conrad. Upon request, Emperor Frederic the second in 1220 confirmed the validity of the solution regarding the division of the land owned by Conrad and Obizzo in the territories of Liguria, Lombardy and of Lunigiana. Conrad was entrusted with lands in the \u201cAppennino Lombardo\u201d, amongst which: Val Trebbia (valley of the river Trebbia) and the castle of Pregola; in LunigianaE. Branchi, Storia della Lunigiana feudale, Pistoia 1897-1899, I, 134-165. he occupied Mulazzo and the lands on the right of the Magra river. G. Fiori, I Malaspina. Castelli e feudi nell'Oltrepo piacentino, pavese, tortonese, Piacenza 1995, Appendice, 275\u2013276. == The relationship with Emperor Frederick the second == The relationship Conrad and his cousin Obizzo started with Emperor Frederick II was very prolific, even though they didn\u2019t have a prominent position in his court, they followed him in northern and central Italy during his campaigns. Conrad was at Frederick\u2019s side in the battles of Monterosi (1220), Capua (1222) and Pontremoli (1226). Conrad\u2019s alliance with Frederick II was briefly interrupted in 1226, because the two cousins sided with Milan and Piacenza, against the Emperial Party. While Obizzo\u2019s schism lasted even after the conflict, after a few months, Conrad went back to the emperor\u2019s side. Hence in 1248 Frederick II gave all the Lunigiana to Pisa, except for Conrad\u2019s land and the castle of Pontremoli, to thank him for his loyalty. After the emperor\u2019s death (1250), Conrad went back to his family and managing his possessions, he then helped the Spino Fiorito branch to reestablish its position of power, as reported in a document stating that in 1253 the two cousins occupied for a short period Pontremoli. After July 1254 there are no documents about Conrad\u2019s actions but it is known that in 1259 his wife (at the time) Agnesina was widowed (implying his death to be between 1254 and 1259). == Marriage and Offspring == Conrad had 7 children in total: Moroello, Franceschino, Albert, Manfredi, Federico, Selvaggia and Beatrice, he also raised as his own the illegitimate child of his cousin Frederik I Malaspina, Conrad Malaspina (the young) (also known as Corradino). His first wife is thought to be Costanza (daughter of Frederick II) but there is no written document confirming this, in 1259 the existence of a new consort is confirmed, Agnesina. == The Malaspina family and Patronage == The common management of the family\u2019s assets and the political strategies, pursued by Conrad, and his uncles Alberto and Guglielmo Malaspina, reflected the spirit of the courtly period in which the family lived. The Malaspina family became patron to several Proven\u00e7al Troubadours that were travelling to the northern Italian courts. Some of the most famous were: Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Abertet de Sisteron and Guilhelm de la Tor.G. L. Mannucci, I marchesi Malaspina e i poeti provenzali, in Dante e la Lunigiana, Milano 1909, 35-88. To the family members were dedicated several songs, sirventes and tensos, many of which had a political topic.Malaspina. Canzoni preghiere detti e poesie del reventino == Dante\u2019s Homage == In the eighth chant of the Purgatory, Dante Alighieri celebrates their courtly values, especially liberality and hospitality, that were well known in the entirety of Europe.E. Salvatori, Les Malaspina: bandits de grands chemins ou champions du raffinement courtois? Quelques consid\u00e9rations sur une cour qui a ouvert ses portes aux troubadours (XII\u00e8me - XIII\u00e8me si\u00e8cles) , in Les \u00e9lites lettr\u00e9es, a cura di Patrick Gilli, Montpellier === Original version === La fama che la vostra casa onora, grida i segnori e grida la contrada, s\u00ec che ne sa chi non vi fu ancora; e io vi giuro, s\u2019io di sopra vada, che vostra gente onrata non si sfregia del pregio de la borsa e de la spada. (Divina Commedia, Purgatorio, Dante Alighieri, Canto 8, Vv. 121-129 )Dante Alighieri, La Divina Commedia, ed. G. Petrocchi, Torino 1975. === English translation === \u201cOh!\u201d said I then to him, \u201cI \u2019ve never been in your domains, but where throughout all Europe dwelleth a man who knows them not? The fame which honoreth your house, proclaims its lords, proclaims its district, so that even he knows of them, who hath never been there yet. I swear to you, so may I go on high, that of the glorious use of purse and sword your honored race doth not despoil itself.
