SL has its origins in AB Stockholms Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4gar (SS), a city-owned public transit company which started in 1915 by the City of Stockholm with the aim to deprivatize the two separate private tramway networks into one more efficient company. SS would in the late 1920s also acquire private motorbus companies. The first part of the Stockholm Metro was opened in 1950. SS was renamed to SL in January 1967 when the metro, local train, and bus operations in Stockholm County were merged into a single organisation under the supervision of Stockholm County Council. The different mass transit systems within the County had until then been run by different organisations, Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar, private companies and companies owned by the local municipalities. In 1993 SL began to use independent contractors for the operation and maintenance of the different transport systems. For bus traffic the operators own the buses, but for rail bound traffic the SL own the trains, and the contractors operate them. ==Contractors== Keolis-owned articulated MAN Lion's City bus with SL branding The contractors used by SL are as of July 2019 the following: *Arriva **Bus traffic in Danderyd, Eker\u00f6, Sollentuna, Solna, Sundbyberg, T\u00e4by, Vaxholm, V\u00e4sterort and \u00d6ster\u00e5ker. **Rail traffic on Saltsj\u00f6banan, Roslagsbanan, Nockebybanan and Tv\u00e4rbanan. *Keolis **Bus traffic in Stockholm City Centre, Botkyrka, Huddinge, Liding\u00f6, Nacka, Salem, S\u00f6derort and V\u00e4rmd\u00f6. *Transdev **Bus Traffic in Sigtuna, Upplands V\u00e4sby and Vallentuna. *MTR Nordic **Stockholm metro **Stockholm commuter rail *Nobina **Bus traffic in Haninge, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Norrt\u00e4lje, Nykvarn, Nyn\u00e4shamn, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Tyres\u00f6 and Upplands-Bro. *AB Stockholms Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4gar **Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4g City **Liding\u00f6banan ==References== ==External links== * * Tram Travels: Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) Category:Transport in Stockholm County Category:Transport in Stockholm Category:Companies based in Stockholm Category:Railway companies of Sweden Category:Public transport companies in Sweden Category:Public transport authorities of Sweden ",
