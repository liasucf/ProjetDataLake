    "text": "In topology, a topological space is said to be resolvable if it is expressible as the union of two disjoint dense subsets. For instance, the real numbers form a resolvable topological space because the rationals and irrationals are disjoint dense subsets. A topological space that is not resolvable is termed irresolvable. == Properties == * The product of two resolvable spaces is resolvable * Every locally compact topological space without isolated points is resolvable * Every submaximal space is irresolvable ==See also== * Glossary of topology ==References== * * * Category:Properties of topological spaces ",
