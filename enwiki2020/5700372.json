    "text": "Craig Lindsay Lefferts (born September 29, 1957) is a former relief pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers and California Angels between 1983 and 1994. ==Early life== Lefferts was born in West Germany, one of five children of Ed, a United States Air Force officer, and Bobbie Lefferts. Lefferts moved to Sacramento, Japan, Topeka, Cape Cod and San Diego before the family settled in the Tampa Bay area. As a child, Lefferts suffered from asthma, was prone to attacks and his parents did not let him play baseball until he was 12 years old. Lefferts received a commission to attend the United States Air Force Academy where he planned to become a pilot like his father. However, he failed the pilot physical due to a lack of depth perception and lazy eye. Lefferts' father wrote to his alma mater, the University of Arizona, and asked if his son could walk on to the school's baseball team. Coach Jerry Kindall added Lefferts to the roster but cut him shortly thereafter as he was undersized (at and ) and did not throw hard. Lefferts eventually worked his way back onto the roster to become one of the team's best pitchers. Lefferts represented the United States at the 1979 Pan American Games. He graduated from the University of Arizona and was the winning pitcher in the 1980 College World Series title game, leading the Arizona Wildcats to a 5-3 victory over the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. He was named to the 1980 College World Series all-tournament team. He was then drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the ninth round of the 1980 amateur draft. ==Professional career== Lefferts helped the Padres win the 1984 National League pennant and the Giants win the 1987 National League West division title and the 1989 National League pennant. In the winter of 1985 he was offered to the New York Mets in exchange for outfielder Lenny Dykstra, but Mets general manager Frank Cashen declined the offer. The 83 games he pitched in during 1986 not only led the National League but remains a Padres single season record. Lefferts was traded by the Padres to the Orioles for Erik Schullstrom on August 31, 1992 in a transaction which was completed four days later on September 4 when Ricky Guti\u00e9rrez was also sent to San Diego.\"Orioles Trade for Lefty Lefferts, Give Padres Minor Leaguer, etc.,\" News & Record (Greensboro, NC), Tuesday, September 1, 1992.

He was the first pitcher to hit a walk- off home run since Moe Drabowsky in 1969. A few years after retiring as a player, Lefferts became a coach in the Toronto Blue Jays system before joining the Oakland Athletics system in 2001 and, in 2015, became the team's pitching rehab coordinator.
