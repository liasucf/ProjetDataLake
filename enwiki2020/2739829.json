The group's founders were Tanya Huff, S. M. Stirling, Karen Wehrstein, Shirley Meier, Louise Hypher, Terri Neal and Lloyd Penney. Later members included Julie Czerneda, Fiona Patton, Marian Hughes, Stephanie Rendino and others.Ketterer, David. Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1992; p. 108 The group became a model for other Toronto writing groups including the Cecil Street Irregulars, the Ink*Specs, and others.
