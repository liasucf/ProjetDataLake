    "text": "Keshvar ajam used to mean \"the country of the Ajam (Iranians)\" in a letter from the Ottoman Empire to Iranian emperor Mohammad Shah Qajar in 1839 Ajam () is an Arabic word meaning mute, which today refers to someone whose mother tongue is not Arabic. During the Arab conquest of Persia, the term became a racial pejorative. ==Etymology== According to traditional etymology, the word \u02bfajam comes from the Semitic root \u02bf-j-m. Related forms of the same root include, but are not limited to: * musta\u02bfjim: mute, incapable of speech * \u02bfajama / \u02bea\u02bfjama / \u02bfajjama: to dot \u2013 in particular, to add the dots that distinguish between various Arabic letters to a text (and hence make it easier for a non-native Arabic speaker to read). It is now an obsolete term, since all modern Arabic texts are dotted. This may also be linked to \u02bfaj\u0101m / \u02bfajam \"pit, seed (e.g. of a date or grape)\". Persian painting, depicting Jamshid halved before Zahhak * in\u02bfajama: (of speech) to be incomprehensible * ista\u02bfjama: to fall silent; to be unable to speak * 'a\u02bfjam: non-fluent Homophonous words, which may or may not be derived from the same root, include: * \u02bfajama: to test (a person); to try (a food). Modern use of \"ajam\" has the meaning of \"non-Arab\". ==Original meaning== The verb \u02bfajama originally meant \"to mumble, and speak indistinctly\", which is the opposite of \u02bfaraba, \u201cto speak clearly\u201d. Accordingly, the noun \u02bfujma, of the same root, is the opposite of fu\u1e63\u1e25a, which means \"chaste, correct, Arabic language\".Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Ajam, p.700 \" In general, during the Umayyad period ajam was a pejorative term used by Arabs who believed in their social and political superiority, in early history after Islam. However, the distinction between Arab and Ajam is discernible in pre-Islamic poetry. ==Pejorative use== During the Umayyad period, the term developed a derogatory meaning as the word was used to refer to non-Arab speakers (primarily Persians) as illiterate and uneducated. Arab conquerors in that period tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Angry with the prevalence of the Persian language in the Divan and Persian society, Persian resistance to this mentality was popularised in the final verse of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh; this verse is widely regarded by Iranians as the primary reason that they speak Persian and not Arabic to this day. Under the Umayyad dynasty, official association with the Arab dominion was only given to those with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status (maw\u0101l\u012b, another derogatory term translated to mean \"slave\" or \"lesser\" in this context). The pejorative use to denote Persians as \"Ajam\" is so ingrained in the Arab world that it is colloquially used to refer to Persians as \"Ajam\" neglecting the original definition and etymology of the word. ==Colloquial use== According to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, \"by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality (tasw\u012ba) with the Arabs, if not their superiority (taf\u017c\u012bl) over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the \u0160o\u02bf\u016bb\u012bya). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the \u02bfA\u01f0am as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life. After these controversies had died down, and the Persians had achieved a position of power in the Islamic world comparable to their numbers and capabilities, \"\u02bfAjam\" became a simple ethnic and geographical designation.\".Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Ajam\", Bosworth Thus by the ninth century, the term was being used by Persians themselves as an ethnic term, and examples can be given by Asadi Tusi in his poem comparing the superiority of Persians and Arabs. Jalal Khaleqi Motlaq, \"Asadi Tusi\", Majaleyeh Daneshkadeyeh Adabiyaat o Olum-e Insani(Literature and Humanities Magazine), Ferdowsi University, 1357(1978). page 71. Accordingly: \"territorial notions of \u201cIran,\u201d are reflected in such terms as ir\u0101n\u0161ahr, ir\u0101nzamin, or Faris, the Arabicized form of P\u0101rs/F\u0101rs (Persia). The ethnic notion of \u201cIranian\u201d is denoted by the Persian words P\u0101rsi or Ir\u0101ni, and the Arabic term Ahl Faris (inhabitants of Persia) or \u02bfAjam, referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in molk-e \u02bfAjam (Persian kingdom) or moluk-e \u02bfAjam (Persian kings).\".Encyclopedia Iranica, \"IRANIAN IDENTITY iii. MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC PERIOD\" by Ahmad Ashraf According to The Political Language of Islam, during the Islamic Golden Age, 'Ajam' was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula viewed as \"alien\" or outsiders. The early application of the term included all of the non-Arab peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including Persians, Byzantine Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Assyrians, Mandaeans, Arameans, Jews, Georgians, Sabians, Samaritans, Egyptians, and Berbers. During the early age of the Caliphates, Ajam was often synonymous with \"foreigner\" or \"stranger\". In the Western Asia, it was generally applied to the Persians, while in al-Andalus it referred to speakers of Romance languages - becoming \"Aljamiado\" in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages - and in West Africa refers to the Ajami script or the writing of local languages such as Hausa and Fulani in the Arabic alphabet. In Zanzibar ajami and ajamo means Persian which came from the Persian Gulf and the cities of Shiraz and Siraf. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used Ajam to refer to Persian. In the Persian Gulf region today, people still refer to Persians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as sajjad al Ajami (Ajami carpet), Persian cat as Ajami cats, and Persian Kings as Ajami kings.The Book.documents on the Persian gulf's name.names of Iran pp.23-60 Molk e Ajam= Persi .
