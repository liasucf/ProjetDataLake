The family doctor, Mr. Walsh (Miles Malleson), suggests the mansion be turned into a guest house to bring in funds. Half the family supports the idea, but Uncle Hercules (Jimmy Edwards) and Consuelo (Athene Seyler) endeavour to sabotage the scheme. All the while, Aunt Anna Rose (Martita Hunt) insists she has mislaid a fortune in jewels \u2013 but her story is doubted due to her eccentric personality. When the first paying guests, Eustace Mills (Naunton Wayne), Mrs. Cleghorn-Thomas (June Clyde) and daughter Yvonne (Mara Lane), arrive for their holiday, expecting peace and quiet, they find themselves caught up in a series of farcical situations caused by their hosts. ==Cast== * Martita Hunt \u2013 Aunt Anna Rose * Jimmy Edwards \u2013 Hercules Ryall / Sir Roderick Ryall * Naunton Wayne \u2013 Eustace Mills * Athene Seyler \u2013 Consuelo Howard * June Clyde \u2013 Mrs. Cleghorn-Thomas * Miles Malleson \u2013 Mr Walsh * Susan Stephen \u2013 Mary O'Leary * Brian Worth \u2013 Philip * Mara Lane \u2013 Yvonne * Maire O'Neill \u2013 Brigid * Toke Townley \u2013 William Burke * Bee Duffell \u2013 Mrs. Guidera * Joseph Tomelty \u2013 Poacher * John McDarby \u2013 Taxi Driver * Tony Quinn \u2013 Dan Brady * Wilfred Caithness \u2013 Doctor * Hamlyn Benson \u2013 Butler * Irene Handl \u2013 Nanny * Shelagh Carty \u2013 2nd Nanny * Kendrick Owen \u2013 Stable Boy * Marguerite Brennan \u2013 Pert Little Maid * Diana Campbell \u2013 2nd Maid * John Kelly \u2013 Bookmaker * Kenneth Kove \u2013 Clergyman * Patrick O'Connor \u2013 Telegraph Boy * James Page \u2013 Racing Enthusiast * Roger Maxwell \u2013 Military-Looking Man * Nella Occleppo \u2013 Schoolgirl * Michael Ripper \u2013 Removal Man * Fred Johnson \u2013 2nd Removal Man * Alfie Bass \u2013 Tipster ==Critical reception== TV Guide called it \"A tedious comedy\";http://www.tvguide.com/movies/treasure-hunt/review/121192/ Britmovie called it a \"Minor farce\";http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Treasure-Hunt_1952/ while Sky Movies wrote, \"Producer Anatole de Grunwald adapted the stage play by M J Farrell and John Perry in an enjoyably straightforward way.
