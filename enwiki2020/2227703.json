The party was defeated in the May 1956 UN plebiscite in British Togoland, which resulted in the unification of British Trans-Volta Togoland with Gold Coast, which later became independent as Ghana.Daniel Miles McFarland, Historical Dictionary of Ghana, 1985, p. 173 On 9 May 1956, a vote was conducted to decide the future disposition of British Togoland and French Togoland. The native and dominant ethnic group, the Ewe people, were divided between the two Togos. British Togoland inhabitants voted in favor of state union with the Gold Coast, and the Togo Ewe state was incorporated with Gold Coast. There was vocal opposition to the incorporation of Togoland into modern Ghana, from the Ewe people who voted (42%) against in British Togoland, as the Ewe wanted the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state (modern Togo).McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \"The Politics of the Independence Movements\". Recently, a campaign for the cessation of some part of the Volta Region from Ghana to be known as \"Western Togoland\" is being led by a group calling itself Homeland Study Group Foundation. The group is led by Charles Kormi Kudzodzi. ==Tourism== Theora video of Tagbo Falls in Hohoe, Hohoe Municipal, Volta region. ===Recreation areas=== ;Museum ;* Volta Regional Museum ===Mountains=== * Mount Afadja * Mount Adaklu * Mount Gemi ===Other Tourist Attractions=== ;Waterfalls * Tafi Agome Caves *Tafi Atome Monkey Sanctuary * Wli Waterfalls * Tagbo Falls * Amedzofe Falls * Biakpa Falls and Caves * Kpoeta waterfalls (at Ho West District) *Mount Afadja * Mount Gemi * Akpom Falls and limestone cave Logba Tota * Snake Village Liate Wote * Adidime waterfalls Klefe (at Ho Municipal) ==Notable native citizens== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=3 | Notable native citizens of Volta |- ! # !
