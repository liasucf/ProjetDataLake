    "text": "Octavio Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Castro (June 30, 1962 \u2013 February 15, 2020), better known as Tony Fern\u00e1ndez, was a Dominican shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for seven teams from 1983 to 2001, most notably the Toronto Blue Jays. A five-time All-Star, Fern\u00e1ndez was known for his defensive skills, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards (1986\u20131989). He batted over .300 four times, led the major leagues with 17 triples in 1990, collected 30 doubles six times and 20 stolen bases seven times. He also led American League shortstops in assists three times, and in putouts and fielding average twice each. After moving to the National League in a blockbuster trade following the 1990 season, he returned to the Blue Jays in a mid-season trade in 1993, and played a major role in helping the club repeat as World Series champions, batting .333 with nine runs batted in during the series. ==Early life== Fern\u00e1ndez was born in San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, Dominican Republic, of Haitian descent. He was first scouted by the Toronto Blue Jays' Latin America scout Epy Guerrero and was signed as an undrafted free agent in 1979. ==Career== Promoted to the Blue Jays in 1983, Fern\u00e1ndez became the team's full-time shortstop in 1985, and contributed significantly to the team winning its first division title that year. Fern\u00e1ndez continued to star for the Jays for several years afterwards. His 213 hits in 1986 were, at the time, a major league single-season record for a shortstop. Before the 1991 season, Fern\u00e1ndez was traded to the San Diego Padres in a deal that also sent Jays star Fred McGriff to San Diego in exchange for Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter. Fern\u00e1ndez played for San Diego for two years. After the 1992 season, the Padres traded him to the New York Mets for D. J. Dozier, Wally Whitehurst, and a player to be named later. After a disappointing start to the 1993 season, the Mets traded him back to the Blue Jays for Darrin Jackson. He played well for the remainder of the season and was instrumental in helping the Blue Jays win the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. In that World Series, Fern\u00e1ndez drove in nine runs, a record for a shortstop. Before the 1995 season, Fern\u00e1ndez signed a two-year contract with the New York Yankees. It was because of an injury early in the season to Fern\u00e1ndez that Derek Jeter was called up to the major leagues for the first time. Fern\u00e1ndez injured his elbow during spring training in 1996, and missed the entire season. Fern\u00e1ndez signed with the Cleveland Indians for the 1997 season. Thanks in large part to his own game-winning home run against Baltimore in the American League Championship Series\u2014the only 1\u20130 game in MLB postseason history with an extra-innings home run\u2014he played in the 1997 World Series with the Indians. In Game 7 of the World Series against the Florida Marlins, Fern\u00e1ndez hit a two-run single in the top of the third inning for the Indians' only runs of the game, and was in position to be credited with the Series-winning hit for Cleveland, had they won the game. However, in the bottom of the 11th inning, Fern\u00e1ndez committed an error on a potential double play ball while playing at second base, and the eventual World Series-winning run was put on base as a result. In 1998, he rejoined the Blue Jays, and revitalized his hitting, batting over .300 in two seasons there. In 2000, Fern\u00e1ndez played for the Seibu Lions in Japan before returning to the majors the following year. When he returned in 2001, he briefly played for the Milwaukee Brewers but returned to Toronto late in the season, and retired at its conclusion. A very thin man, Fern\u00e1ndez had a tilted, wavering batting stance that made it appear as if he might not be strong enough to hold his bat. From early in his career he carried a scar on his right cheek from a pitched ball. Fern\u00e1ndez was a noted fitness fanatic. Early in his career, Fern\u00e1ndez was well known for his exceptional defensive skills at shortstop, and was described by Ivan Maisel in a Sports Illustrated article as having \"the range of a Texas cattleman\". He was especially famous for leaping into the air while simultaneously making an underhanded throw to first base, on balls hit far to his right. Fern\u00e1ndez was awarded four consecutive Gold Glove Awards for his defense, from 1986 to 1989. Fern\u00e1ndez was also named to five All-Star teams. He finished his career with a .288 batting average in 2,158 games played, and batted .327 in postseason play. Fernandez hit for the cycle as a New York Yankee on September 3, 1995, against the Oakland Athletics. He set a nine-year record for shortstops with a .992 fielding percentage in 1989, while still holding the single-season fielding percentage record for third basemen with .991 in 1994. On October 17, 2016, Fernandez was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, where he thanked the fans in Toronto, Ontario and in Canada for embracing him. ==Illness and death== Fern\u00e1ndez announced in 2017 he had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. On February 15, 2020, he died at a hospital in Weston, Florida following complications with a stroke, pneumonia, and an induced coma. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:New York Mets players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:American League All-Stars Category:National League All-Stars Category:Gold Glove Award winners Category:Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:Seibu Lions players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball second basemen Category:Nippon Professional Baseball third basemen Category:Kinston Eagles players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Sportspeople from San Pedro de Macor\u00eds Category:Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic) Category:Dominican Republic people of Haitian descent Category:Deaths from kidney disease ",
