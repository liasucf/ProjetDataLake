    "text": "The USP, for Universal Space Platform (Russian: ), also known as Viktoria (), is a highly flexible satellite bus designed and manufactured by RSC Energia. It is called universal because it has been designed to be operated from LEO to GEO. It is a three axis stabilized platform with electric propulsion for station keeping, but chemical propellant is offered as an option. The bus can offer up to 3000 W of power and a payload capacity up to for Low Earth orbit or HEO an up to for geostationary orbit. The platform is designed for direct orbital injection, and thus lacks orbit raising propulsion. It does however, support dual launching on Proton-M, which can enable cheap launching, or the use of smaller vehicles like the Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat-M or even the Dnepr for low energy orbits. ==List of USP bus satellites== While not the most successful satellite bus, the USP is characterized by its commercial beginnings and the huge orbital flexibility. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- !
