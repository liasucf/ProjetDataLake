    "text": "\"I've Had Enough\" is a song by the British\u2013American rock band Wings, released as a single from their 1978 album London Town. It reached on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, in Canada and in the UK. In the Netherlands, the 2-sided single \"I've Had Enough\" combined with its B-side \"Deliver Your Children\" reached . ==Writing and recording== \"I've Had Enough\" was written and sung by Paul McCartney. The music and an improvised chorus were recorded on board the boat Fair Carol in the Virgin Islands prior to the departure of Wings' lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Joe English. According to McCartney, they did not have any of the words until the band returned to London from the Fair Carol recording sessions. He then wrote \"a few\" words and overdubbed the lyrics in London. ==Lyrics and music== The lyrics of \"I've Had Enough\" primarily vent the singer's frustration in the face of various circumstances. McCartney referred to it as \"just one of those 'fed up' songs.\" Wings' label Capitol Records described it as \"a driving rock 'n' roll tune that lyrically describes an artist's ultimatum to the taxman, a self-serving manager, or both.\" Syndicated columnist Joel McNally regarded the song as containing political commentary. The song is in the key of D major. Music professor Vincent Benitez describes the song as a musically simple \"guitar-dominated rocker,\" with alternating verses and chorus following the introductory section. According to McNally, \"it is done in the rock styles of the '50s, '60s and '70s. All at the same time.\" Billboard Magazine found the song structure to be similar to early songs McCartney wrote for the Beatles. ==Reception== Rolling Stone critic Janet Maslin claimed that \"I've Had Enough\" hints \"at a minor mean streak, which \"spices up\" the London Town album \"with a welcome note of discord.\" McCartney biographer Peter A. Carlin claimed the song reflects \"the righteous outrage of a man who can't find his slippers.\" Tom Waseleski of Beaver County Times praised McCartney's \"raspy, boyish vocal\" as a throwback to his early days with the Beatles. Author Tim Riley calls it a \"simplistic screamer.\" Beatles' biographer John Blaney claims that it is \"not very effective,\" despite \"a half decent riff and a snappy arrangement,\" and suggests that the \"negative\" chorus may reflect McCartney's dissatisfaction with the band at the time. On the other hand Kingsport Times-News critic Michael Clark regarded \"I've Had Enough\" to be the best song on London Town, calling it \"guitar-riff oriented in Paul's best Beatle tradition\" and stating that the lyrics evoke \"Get Back\" and similar Beatle songs \"without drawing specifically from the same sources.\" Billboard Magazine suggested that \"McCartne\u00ff s growling vocal and an insistent beat\" make the song \"a decisive statement in release of pent-up frustrations.\" In 2013, Rolling Stone rated it the #35 all-time Paul McCartney post-Beatles song, describing how it contrasted with Wings' prior single, the \"easygoing\" \"With a Little Luck\" with \"tough talk and guitars to match.\" In that review, Rolling Stone suggested that the song's \"sarcastic snarl\" was influenced by Elvis Costello. McCartney biographer Martin A. Grove, writing at about the time the single was released described \"I Had Enough\" as a \"hard\u2013rocking\" song, which he (as it turned out over-optimistically) predicted may become a hit. ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1978) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands | style=\"text-align:center;\"|13 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|42 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 |} ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics from Paul McCartney's official site Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:1978 singles Category:Wings (band) songs Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Parlophone singles Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:1977 songs ",
