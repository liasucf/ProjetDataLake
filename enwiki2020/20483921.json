    "text": "Buffalo River State Park was an Arkansas state park, established in 1938, that was absorbed into Buffalo National River when the Federal park was established in 1972. The area is now known as Buffalo Point. The new state park was developed with Civilian Conservation Corps labor in 1939 with the construction of park structures to plans from the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs. The CCC structures now comprise a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. One park highlight is a 3-mile trail. The Indian Rockhouse Trail is wonderfully scenic with many great points of interest including sculpted bedrock, a waterfall, a former zinc mine, and the Indian Rockhouse Cave. ==See also== *Big Buffalo Valley Historic District *Rush Historic District *Parker-Hickman Farm Historic District *National Register of Historic Places listings in Marion County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:State parks of Arkansas Category:1939 establishments in Arkansas Category:Rustic architecture in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Marion County, Arkansas Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Arkansas Category:Geography of Marion County, Arkansas Category:State parks of the U.S. Interior Highlands Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, Arkansas ",
