    "text": "Madonna and Child by Luis de Morales, Prado Museum Christ before Pilate, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid Luis de Morales (1512 \u2013 9 May 1586) was a Spanish painter born in Badajoz, Extremadura. Known as \"El Divino\", most of his work was of religious subjects, including many representations of the Madonna and Child and the Passion. Influenced, especially in his early work, by Raphael Sanzio and the school of Leonardo, he was called by his contemporaries \"The Divine Morales\", because of his skill and the shocking realism of his paintings, and because of the spirituality transmitted by all his work. His work has been divided by critics into two periods, an early stage under the influence of Florentine artists such as Michelangelo and a more intense, more anatomically correct later period similar to German and Flemish Renaissance painters. The Prado Museum in Madrid holds around 22 paintings by the master. Some of his Works can be seen at Plasencia, Salamanca's Cathedral and Museum. The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid also owns a couple of Works. ==Selected works== *La Virgen del Pajarito (Virgin of the Bird) (1546), kept in the church of San Agust\u00edn, in Madrid. *La Piedad (Piet\u00e0) (1560), kept in Badajoz Cathedral. *San Juan de Ribera (1564), in the Prado Museum, Madrid. *Ecce Homo, in the Hispanic Society of America. *La Piedad (Piet\u00e0), in the Prado Museum, Madrid. *Virgen de la leche (Breastfeeding Virgin), in the Prado Museum. *St. Jerome in the Wilderness, in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. *Christ tied to a Column, at Kingston Lacy House (National Trust), Dorset U.K. *La Piedad (Piet\u00e0), Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid. *Christ before Pilate, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid. *Virgin and Child with the infant St. John the Baptist, Salamanca's Cathedral *Lamentation of the Christ, Museo de Salamanca. ==References== Category:1510s births Category:1586 deaths Category:People from Badajoz Category:Extremaduran painters Category:16th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:Mannerist painters ",
