Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be the nation's thirteenth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics. Since the nation made its debut in 1964, Nigerien athletes had participated in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, except for two rare occasions, the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the African and the US-led boycotts, respectively. ==Athletics== Nigerien athletes achieved the entry standards, either by qualifying time or by world ranking, in the following track and field events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Track & road events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Aminatou Seyni |align=left|Women's 200 m | | | | | | |-align=center |align=left|Women's 400 m | | | | | | |} ==Taekwondo== Niger entered two athletes into the taekwondo competition at the Games.
