After 33 games, the league splits into two sections of six teams, with each team playing each other in that section. The league attempts to balance the fixture list so that teams in the same section play each other twice at home and twice away, but sometimes this is impossible. A total of 228 matches will be played, with 38 matches played by each team. === Promotion and relegation === Heart of Midlothian were promoted as 2014\u201315 Scottish Championship winners. On 2 May, bottom club Dundee United were defeated 2\u20131 away to their city rivals Dundee, a defeat which confined them to relegation of the Championship. Craig Wighton, a local Dundee fan, scored the winning goal in the 92nd minute of the game. The champion of that league will be promoted to the Premiership for the 2016\u201317 season. The team that finishes 11th in the Premiership will play the winner of the Championship playoffs (teams that finish 2nd, 3rd and 4th in the Championship) in two playoff games, with the winner securing a Premiership spot for the 2016\u201317 season. ==League table== ==Results== ===Matches 1\u201322=== Teams play each other twice, once at home and once away. ===Matches 23\u201333=== Teams play every other team once (either at home or away). ===Matches 34\u201338=== After 33 matches, the league splits into two sections of six teams each, with teams playing every other team in their section once (either at home or away). The exact matches are determined upon the league table at the time of the split. ====Top six==== ====Bottom six==== ==Top scorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Goals |- |1 |align=\"left\"| Leigh Griffiths |align=\"left\"|Celtic |31 |- |2 |align=\"left\"| Kane Hemmings |align=\"left\"|Dundee |21 |- |3 |align=\"left\"| Adam Rooney |align=\"left\"|Aberdeen |20 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|4 |align=\"left\"| Louis Moult |align=\"left\"|Motherwell |rowspan=\"2\"|15 |- |align=\"left\"| Liam Boyce |align=\"left\"|Ross County |- |rowspan=\"2\"|6 |align=\"left\"| Kris Doolan |align=\"left\"|Partick Thistle |rowspan=\"2\"|14 |- |align=\"left\"| Steven MacLean |align=\"left\"|St Johnstone |- |rowspan=\"2\"|8 |align=\"left\"| Billy Mckay |align=\"left\"|Dundee United |rowspan=\"2\"|12 |- |align=\"left\"| Juanma |align=\"left\"| Hearts |- |10 |align=\"left\"| Miles Storey |align=\"left\"|Inverness CT |11 |} ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Month !colspan=\"2\"|Manager of the Month !colspan=\"2\"|Player of the Month !rowspan=\"2\"|Ref. |- !Manager !Club !Player !Club |- |August | Derek McInnes |Aberdeen | Leigh Griffiths |Celtic | rowspan=\"9\" | |- |September | Derek McInnes |Aberdeen | Niall McGinn |Aberdeen |- |October | Ronny Deila |Celtic | Leigh Griffiths |Celtic |- |November | Alan Archibald |Partick Thistle | Michael O'Halloran |St Johnstone |- |December | Mark McGhee |Motherwell | Liam Boyce |Ross County |- |January | Ronny Deila |Celtic | Kane Hemmings |Dundee |- |February | Mixu Paatelainen |Dundee United | Paul Paton |Dundee United |- |March | Mark McGhee |Motherwell | Jackson Irvine |Ross County |- |April | John Hughes |Inverness CT | Patrick Roberts |Celtic |} ==Premiership play-offs== The quarter-finals were contested between the 3rd and 4th placed teams in the Scottish Championship; Hibernian and Raith Rovers.
