Given the importance of the port to the national economy, and the previously poor facilities of the port, a great deal of investment occurred in the 2010s. This facilitated the growth of the mining industry in the country, with the exportation of bauxite. Plans to develop the port to support the shipping of bauxite go back to at least 1983, when a $47.4 million project was announced. The port's Pidjiguiti docks were the site of the Pidjiguiti massacre, which took place on 3 August 1959, when police shot the dockworkers, killing 50 and wounding over 100 people. The stevedores were on their first strike, organized by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (Partido Africano da Independ\u00eancia da Guin\u00e9 e Cabo Verde, PAIGC), marking the beginning of strong resistance against the Portuguese colonial authority. A large, black, fist monument commemorates the massacre. Several older buildings remain around the port area, including the 18th century military barracks and old prison. == Port operation == The Bissau port was designed to handle 5,000 containers a year, yet it serves nearly five times as many today.
