    "text": "Shredder is a commercial chess engine and graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Germany by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen in 1993. Shredder won the World Microcomputer Chess Championship in 1996 and 2000, the World Computer Chess Championship in 1999 and 2003, the World Computer Speed Chess Championship in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007, and the World Chess Software Championship in 2010. One of the features of the Shredder engine is that it can be set to play at different Elo rating levels from beginner to master level. The Shredder GUI will estimate your Elo rating based on your games, and adjust its strength in future games to give you a chance of winning. The Shredder web site also sells Chess Tutor, a teaching program based on the Steps Method course of Dutch psychologist Rob Brunia and IM Cor van Wijgerden. The Shredder engine version 10.0 was released in June 2006. Version 11.0 was released in October 2007. Version 12 was released in January 2010. The \"Deep\" version takes advantage of multiple CPUs or multiple core CPUs. Version 13 was released in 30 October 2016.
