    "text": "Jack Whitham is an English former professional footballer who played for Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool, Cardiff City and Reading. He was a centre forward who only started 111 league games in a nine-year career between 1967 and 1976, scoring 40 goals. He made one appearance for the England under 23 team against Wales in 1968. Whitham was born in Burnley on 8 December 1946; his grandfather Thomas Whitham of the Coldstream Guards had won the Victoria Cross in 1917 for attacking single-handed an enemy machine gun post. He played amateur football for Holy Trinity F.C. before signing for Sheffield Wednesday in October 1964. ==Playing career== ===Sheffield Wednesday=== Whitham made his debut for Wednesday on 6 May 1967 as a substitute against his home town club Burnley and scored twice in a 7\u20130 victory. Whitham's time as a Wednesday player was marred by injury problems; his brave style of play meant that he spent long periods on the treatment table and he never played 20 league games in any season. He scored 10 goals in 10 games at the start of the 1968\u201369 season but never scored again that season as injury took its toll. He still ended up as top scorer that season; his tally included a hat-trick against Manchester United in a memorable 5\u20134 win on 31 August 1968 which was the highlight of his time at Hillsborough. In the following 1969\u201370 season he was top scorer again with 11 goals in all competitions as Wednesday were relegated to Division Two. In April 1970 he was transferred to Liverpool for a sum of \u00a357,000. In his time with Wednesday he scored 31 goals in 62 starts, an excellent record of a goal every other match.\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\", Tony Matthews, , Page 266 Gives biographical information.The Sheffield Wednesday Archive. Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. ===Liverpool=== Whitham was signed by Liverpool as a potential replacement for Roger Hunt who had left to join Bolton Wanderers in December 1969. However, his injury problems continued and he failed to get an extended run in the team. The arrival of John Toshack at Anfield in November 1970 further hindered his chances of first team football. He did well towards the end of 1971 when he scored two late goals in an away win at Coventry City and then scoring a hat-trick in a home 3\u20132 win against Derby County on 11 December 1971. In four years he would play just 15 games for Liverpool, scoring seven goals.www.lfchistory.net. Gives details of Liverpool career and mor.www.ynwa.tv.
