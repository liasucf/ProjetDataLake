It is very particular. I consider that I went through all > stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I > have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, > which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and > I'm very fulfilled. ==Reception and accolades== Upon its release, \"Bop Bop\" was met with good reviews from music critics. Jarom\u00edr Koc of Czech music website Musicserver praised Turner's contribution to the song through his \"unusually colored\" voice. While Italian publication R&B; Junk's Olivio Umberto found that Inna changed her \"formula\" by not collaborating with a rapper but with another singer, Grupo EGF labelled \"Bop Bop\" as \"contagious\" and \"mature\", further acclaiming Turner's performance. Music website Hitfire wrote that the song's title is \"simple\", and went on praising the refrain and Inna's vocal delivery.

While the dancers were dressed in black and white outfits, the singer sports a sparkling silver top. Three additional videos were released during July 2015 in which the track is played for the first time to unspecified citizens of Los Angeles and Inna's fellow Romanian stars; both videos captured extremely positive input, with some listeners predicting its success. The idea behind the visual was based on Inna's desire to create a \"fashion\" video, for which clothes were procured by international brands Marni, Givenchy, HBA HOOD by Air, Balmain, KTZ, Ashish, Pierre Hardy, and Romanian designers Cristina Savulescu and Madalina Dorobantu from Pas du Tout. The accompanying clip for the recording finally premiered on Inna's YouTube channel on 13 July 2015, being shot by Dimitri Caceaune, John Perez and David Gal in Bucharest, Romania; George Dascalescu served as its director of photography. The clip has no plot. ===Synopsis=== Inna (middle) and her backup dancers performing a synchronized choreography in the music video for \"Bop Bop\". The video opens with an old-fashioned TV being turned on, and displaying the word \"BOP\" on its screen. Following this, several photos of women are seen scattered on the floor of a dark-lightened room, which is then followed by Turner appearing to sing the first refrain of the song on the TV's display, wearing black sunglasses and a silver jacket; two fellow females are watching him. Inna is then shown singing to herself in front of a mirror, and subsequently makes appearance sporting an officer outfit consisting of a black hat and a tie. For the second refrain of \"Bop Bop\", the singer and her backup dancers are portrayed performing a synchronized choreography on a runaway. Following this, Inna appears wearing a yellow dress while standing on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, and she and her backup dancers are shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their bodies and picturing themselves. ===Reception and analysis=== While Musicserver was generally positive towards the music video, Tony Sokol from American music website KpopStarz called it a \"scorcher\" and Grupo EGF noticed Lesbian vibe. German website Hitfire labelled the outfits used during the clip \"interesting\", praised the performance of the background dancers, and called the video \"recommendable\". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own music website, described the visual as being \"fashion involved\", and particularly saw Inna's appearance as sexy and confident. Going on, Currinn further likened Turner's appearance on a TV screen to that of Pitbull's in Inna's \"Good Time\" (2014) and Flo Rida's in The Saturdays's \"Higher\" (2010), while being positive to the choreography although stating that it \"isn't in depth enough\". The music video peaked at number two on Media Forest's TV Airplay Chart. Note: Select '2015' and 'Week 40. Period: 28-09-15 04-10-15', and then click on 'Songs\u2013TV'.
