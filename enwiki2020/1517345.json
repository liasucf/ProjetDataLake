    "text": "O'Flaherty (Middle Irish: \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh; Modern Irish: \u00d3 Flaithearta), is an Irish Gaelic clan based most prominently in what is today County Galway. The clan name originated in the 10th century as a derivative of its founder Flaithbheartach mac Eimhin. They descend in the paternal line from the Connachta's U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la. They were originally kings of Maigh Se\u00f3la and Muintir Murchada and as members of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain were kinsmen of the \u00d3 Conchubhair and Mac Diarmada amongst others. After their king Cathal mac Tigern\u00e1n lost out to \u00c1ed in Gai Bernaig in the 11th century, the family were pushed further west to Iar Connacht, a territory associated with Connemara today. They continued to rule this land until the 16th century. ==Naming conventions== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" ! width=20% | Male ! width=20% | Daughter (Long) ! width=20% | Daughter (Short) ! width=20% | Wife (Long) ! width=20% | Wife (Short) |- | align=\"center\"| \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh | align=\"center\"| In\u00edon U\u00ed Fhlaithbheartaigh | align=\"center\"| N\u00ed Fhlaithbheartaigh | align=\"center\"| Bean U\u00ed Fhlaithbheartaigh | align=\"center\"| U\u00ed Fhlaithbheartaigh |- | align=\"center\"| \u00d3 Flaithearta | align=\"center\"| In\u00edon U\u00ed Fhlaithearta | align=\"center\"| N\u00ed Fhlaithearta | align=\"center\"| Bean U\u00ed Fhlaithearta | align=\"center\"| U\u00ed Fhlaithearta |- |} ==Overview== This Gaelic-Irish surname is written as \"Ua Flaithbertach\" (nominative) or \"Ua Flaithbertaig\" (genitive) in Old Irish and Middle Irish texts. In Modern Irish the surname is now generally spelt as \u00d3 Flatharta. The surname is commonly translated as \"bright ruler\" or more correctly \"bright prince\", flaith originally meaning prince in Irish. \"O\" or \u00d3 comes from Ua, designating \"grandson\" or \"descendant\" of a (major) clan member. The prefix is often anglicised to O', using an apostrophe instead of the Irish s\u00edneadh fada: \"'\". Maigh Se\u00f3la was the earliest O'Flaherty domain, to the east of Lough Corrib in the kingdom of Connacht, the westernmost province of the Island of Ireland (Irish: \u00c9ire). The \u00d3 Flaithbertaighs are a branch of the Muintir Murchada dynasty, named after Murchadh mac Maenach (died 891), King of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la. Murchadh is one of the earliest attested kings of his region. The leading family of this dynasty would take the surname \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (O'Flaherty) from the 11th century onwards. In Ulster, the F is aspirated causing the name to be Anglicised as Laverty etc. ==Kings of Magh Se\u00f3la== Ireland in 1450 The U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la was one of the major branches of the powerful U\u00ed Bri\u00fain dynasty, which had become the dominant force in Connacht by the 8th century. The genealogies list two sons of Murchadh mac Maenach: Urchadh and Urumhain. Urchadh mac Murchadh, King of Maigh Se\u00f3la (also listed as king of Iarthair Connacht, died 945, in the 14th century Book of Ballymote) was father of B\u00e9 Binn inion Urchadh, Princess of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la and Queen of Thomond (fl. early 10th century). B\u00e9 Binn married Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in of Thomond to produce a son who would become the High King of Ireland (Irish: Ard-R\u00ed na h\u00c9ireann): Brian B\u00f3ruma mac Cenn\u00e9tig, known in English as Brian Boru (c. 941\u201323 April 1014). Brian broke the near monopoly of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill over the High Kingship of Ireland and fought to unite Ireland as a people under one, native king. His father, Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in of Thomond, was one of the principal leaders of the resistance to the Danish Viking incursions. Cenn\u00e9tig had several wives and children but positively assigned B\u00e9 Binn as the mother of Brian B\u00f3ruma. B\u00e9 Binn's sister Creassa inion Urchadh was a wife of King Tadg mac Cathail of Connacht, while her sister, Caineach inion Urchadh, married the ancestor of the Clann Coscraig sept of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la. Her brother, Donnchadh mac Urchadh succeeded their father as King of Maigh Se\u00f3la (943\u2013959). Like the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la, the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Ai were a major branch of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain dynasty, from whom the high medieval Ua Conchobair (O'Connor) kings of Connacht, including the last high king of Ireland, Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair, were descended. The \u00d3 Flaithbertaigh family line and kingship can be traced back to Bri\u00f3n mac Echach Muigmed\u00f3in, King of Connacht, who was the half-brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Their father, Eochaid Muigh Meadhoin mac Muiredach, was, according to legend, also 122nd High King of Ireland and was a direct descendant of Galamh Milesius (c. 1763 BCE \u2013 c. 1699 BCE). Galamh Milesius's bloodline produced kings in succession for over 3,000 years. Kingship was passed on to direct descendants only starting with \u00c9rim\u00f3n mac M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine, 2nd High King of Ireland son of Galamh Milisius. ==The first \u00d3 Flaithbertaighs== In Connacht the first to bear the name was Muireadhach ua Flaithbheartach, king of Maigh Se\u00f3la, who died in 1034. He is listed as having three sons \u2013 Ruaidhr\u00ed of Lough Cimbe, Donagh Aluinn and Aedh. From Ruaidhr\u00ed and Donagh would descend the O'Flahertys of East and West Connemara. ==Exiled by the Kings of Connacht== In the Annals of the Four Masters, R\u00faaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht, is described as dying at the battle of Glen Patrick in 1061 (Book of Ballymote: died 1062). The Annals state: * Maidhm Glinne Pattraicc ria n-Aodh Ua Conchobhair for Iarthair Connacht, in ro mudhaighith ile im Ruaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh, tigherna Iarthair Connacht, & ro dicendadh \u00e9, & ruccadh a ceann co Cruachain Chonnacht iar sraoineadh for mac Aodha mic Ruaidhri./The victory of Gleann-Phadraig was gained by Aedh Ua Conchobhair over the people of Iar Connacht (West Connacht), where many were slain, together with Ruaidhri. O'Flaithbheartaigh, lord of Iar Connacht, was beheaded, and his head was carried to Cruachain in Connacht, after the son of Aedh, son of Ruaidhri, had been defeated. The following year records that Tadhg, son of Aedh Ua Conchobhair (O'Connor), was \"slain by the son of Aedh, son of Ruaidhri (ie O'Flahertys), and the people of Iar Connacht.\" From this point on, the family were forced into Iar Connacht, as the Kings of Connacht took the original Ua Flaithbheartaigh homeland for themselves. Aedh Ua Flaithbheartaigh, (King of Iar Connacht, died 1079) was the third bearer of the surname Ua Flaithbheartaigh to rule over the Muintir Murchada. Aedh was killed in 1079 by Ruaidr\u00ed na Saide Buide (Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair, anglicised Roderic O'Connor, died 1118), who in turn was blinded by Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh (Flaherty O'Flaherty), King of Iar Connacht, in 1092. ==Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, King of Connacht== Crichaireacht cinedach nduchasa Muintiri Murchada is a tract listing the main families and their estates of the Muintir Murchada in the reign of its lord, Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, who was king of Iar Connacht from 1091 until his death in 1098. He seized the kingship of Connacht in 1092 by blinding the Godfather of his children, King Ruaidr\u00ed na Saide Buide. He was killed by Ruaidr\u00ed's sons in 1098. ==Kings of Iar Connacht== The subsequent king of Iar Connacht, Muireadhach Ua Flaithbheartaigh (died 1121), and his descendants, remained loyal to the \u00d3 Conchobair's. Before the close of the 13th century, the \u00d3 Flaithbertaigh clan became masters of the entire territory of Iar Connacht, extending from the western banks of Lough Corrib to the shores of the Atlantic. In the 1230s, the Normans invaded Ireland and took Galway. Native Irish were forbidden from entering the city freely. In the 16th century, the \u00d3 Flaithbertaigh built a tower house called Aughnanure Castle, which was featured on an Irish stamp and is now a National Monument and tourist destination, managed by the Office of Public Works. ==Motto and Coat of Arms== The clan motto is Fortuna Favet Fortibus, or \"Fortune Favours the Brave\" which may have been inspired by the same line in Virgil's Aeneid. The \u00d3 Flaithbertaigh coat of arms depicts \"two red lizards or dragons rampant combatant, supporting a red dexter hand, couped at the wrists, in base a black boat with eight oars\". The two red lizards or dragons are often confused with the lions of the English heraldic tradition. Often a grey or green salamander is depicted on a black or grey helmet above the coat of arms. However, there is little known of Irish heraldic tradition as compared to that of the English although Irish use of distinctive flags and banners in battle is recorded in Irish annals such as the Annals of the Four Masters. ==Notable \u00d3 Flaithbertaighs== Liam \u00d3 Flaithearta. * Muireadhach ua Flaithbheartach, King of Maigh Se\u00f3la, died 1034. * Murchadh an Chapail Ua Flaithbheartaigh, King of Maigh Se\u00f3la/Iar Connacht, died 1036. * R\u00faaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht, died 1061. * Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, King of Connacht, died 1098. * Conchobhar Ua Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht, died 1132. * \u00c1edh M\u00f3r \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, died 1236. * Murchad Ua Flaithbertaig, Bishop of Annaghdown, c. 1202\u20131241. * Morogh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht and Chief of the Name, fl. 1244. * Ruaidhri \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, King of Iar Connacht and Chief of the Name, fl. 1244\u20131273. * \u00c1edh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, Taoiseach of Iar Connacht and Chief of the Name, fl. c. 1377?\u20131407. * D\u00f3nal \"an Chogaidh\" \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Donal of the Battle), also known as Donall an Cullagh (The Cock).
