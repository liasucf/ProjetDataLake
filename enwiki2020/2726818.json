    "text": "John Rex (5 March 1925 \u2013 18 December 2011) was a South African-born British sociologist. Born in Port Elizabeth, he was radicalised after working for the South African Bantu Affairs Administration and moved to Britain. He was a lecturer at the universities of Leeds (1949\u201362) (where he was a leading left- wing activist), Birmingham (1962\u201364), Durham (1964\u201370), Warwick (1970\u201379 and 1984\u201390), Aston (1979\u201384), Toronto (1974\u201375), Cape Town (1991) and New York (1996). He was also a member of the UNESCO International Experts' Committee on Racism and Race Prejudice (1967) and president of the International Sociological Association's Research Committee on Racial and Ethnic Minorities (1974\u201382). ==Academic work== His academic work involved the analysis of conflict as a key problem of both society and sociological theory. His 1961 book, Key Problems of Sociological Theory, was his first major work where conflict was claimed to be more realistic than the past British functionalist theories of social order and system-stability. He is also known for his studies of race and ethnic relations. He analyzed the classic tradition of sociology, including Karl Marx, Max Weber, Georg Simmel and \u00c9mile Durkheim in his book Discovering Sociology (1973). He was a professor emeritus at Warwick University. His life has been described by of Oxford University1993 as one where both \"passion\" and \"knowledge\" intertwined. Theory and practice was for him always a dynamic issue and led to his demands for \"objective\" research and comment while being a political radical involved in the UK's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the New Left Review. == Publications == ===Books=== His book publications include: * (reprint Taylor & Francis, 1970, ) *Race, Community and Conflict: a study of Sparkbrook, with R.S.Moore, OUP 1967 *Discovering Sociology, 1973 *Race, Colonialism and the City, 1973 * * * *Apartheid and Social Research, ed., Paris: UNESCO 1981 *Social Conflict - A Theoretical and Conceptual Analysis, 1981 *The Ghetto and the Underclass, Aldershot, 1987 *Ethnic Minorities and the Modern Nation State London 1996 ===Articles=== His articles include: *\"Ethnic and Race Issues\", 1996 (in: Youth and Social Work on the Move, ed. by Amesberger, Sch\u00f6rghuber and Krehan, in: European Union Congress Report, published by the Institute of Sports Sciences of the University of Vienna, Austria. ===On John Rex=== * *Abbas, Tahir and Frank Reeves, Immigration and Race Relations: Sociological Theory and John Rex, 2007 ==Notes== Category:Academics of Aston University Category:Academics of Durham University Category:Academics of the University of Birmingham Category:Academics of the University of Leeds Category:Academics of the University of Warwick Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:British sociologists Category:South African sociologists Category:Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Category:1925 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Port Elizabeth Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom ",
