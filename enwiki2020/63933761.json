    "text": "A reconstructed Diplacanthus acus. Diplacanthus is an extinct genus of Mid to Late Devonian fish in the class Acanthodii, known as spiny sharks. ==Taxonomy== The genus was named by Louis Agassiz in 1843. It was formerly regarded as belonging to the Climatiformes but recently reassigned to the Diplacanthiformes, in which it is united with, amongst others, Rhadinacanthus, Uraniacanthus, and Culmacanthus. Diplacanthiforms were widespread during the Middle and early Late Devonian. They are best represented in the Middle Devonian, by articulated fossils, fin spines, and abundant scales, the latter particularly from northern Europe. In the latest revision of the genus Diplacanthus a large number of species from Europe were synonymised with earlier Scottish species, and these too were redefined. D. crassisimus was taken to have precedence over D. striatus as the name of the type specimen. Diplacanthus longispinus was reassigned to Rhadinacanthus longispinus, within which were also included Diplacanthus horridus Woodward and Diplacanthus ellsi. Diplacanthus tenuistriatus and Diplacanthus kleesmentae were however retained. Non-Laurussian species such as Diplacanthus acus from South Africa were not considered in this review. Burrow, C.

(2020). \"Estuarine fish and tetrapod evolution: Insights from a Late Devonian (Famennian) Gondwanan estuarine lake and a southern African Holocene equivalent\". Biological Reviews. doi:10.1111/brv.12590. The type specimen of Diplacanthus acus is approximately 100 mm long and has exceptionally long thin ribbed spines. The intermediate spines are, conversely, extremely reduced.Gess, R. W. (2001). A new species of Diplacanthus from the Late Devonian (Famennian) of South Africa. Annales de Pal\u00e9ontologie 87, 49 \u201360 Unusually it preserves complete outlines of many of the fins. Diplacanthus is most commonly associated with deposits traditionally interpreted as fresh water, however Waterloo Farm is interpreted as estuarine in origin, as is the Canadian Miguashaia lagerst\u00e4tte from which two species of Diplacanthus have been described.Gess, R. and Coates M. (2008). Vertebrate Diversity of the Late Devonian (Famennian) Deposit near Grahamstown, South Africa. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology: 28 (3) conference supplement p 83. The description of Diplacanthus acus provided the first record of a diplacanthid from the Famennian, diplacanthids having previously been thought to have gone extinct by the end of the Frasnian.Janvier, P.(1996).
