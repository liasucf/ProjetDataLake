It was renamed Sirius Academy in September 2009 under Building Schools for the Future, with Sports College specialist status. ==History== The last headteacher of Pickering High School was Elaine Wadsworth, who was replaced by a principal, Cathy Taylor, when the school became an academy. In September 2011 the school moved into a new \u00a348.5 million building which replaced an older one, bringing the school within one site, with a new sports hall to support sports college status. The school's GCSE results have improved over the years. After becoming an academy the school was originally known as Sirius Academy. However, in 2015 Thomas Ferens Academy joined the Sirius Academy Multi Academy Trust and was renamed Sirius Academy North. Sirius Academy was renamed Sirius Academy West to distinguish the two institutions. ==Facilities== School facilities include an all-weather pitch, sports hall, sports lab, hair and beauty salon, industrial quality food technology rooms, dance studio, construction bays and an eco-dome. == Ofsted== The 2003 Ofsted inspection rated the school as Grade 2 \"Good\", highlighting strengths, and improvements to be made.
