In September 2003 he published the blog Fogonazos, where he writes a compilation of his \"daily astonnments\", articles on science, curiosities and current impressions of the same. In La 2 de Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola () he presented the section The demonstration (, a space designed to explain concepts of physics, chemistry and neuroscience through simple experiments, in the program Orbita Laika, presented by \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn. On 28 December 2009, he published in Fogonazos an article entitled National Geographic destapa el fraude de Stonehenge. In it he claimed that 90% of the stones of Stonehenge had been placed in successive \"restorations\", that is to say, a montage. He accompanied this article with photographic evidence and narrated how archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson had discovered that several of the dolerite rocks contained a variety of feldspar that had nothing to do with those located in Perseli, where the oldest megaliths were extracted. What was a joke for the day of the innocent took immediate relevance internationally and National Geographic had to intervene to deny it.
