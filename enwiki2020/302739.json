Prior to joining the UN, Watson worked with the European Commission and for a period with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. During her career with the UN, Watson had been involved in many of the world's hot spots, including Bosnia and Kosovo: Watson worked in the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to Bernard Kouchner the UN's special representative to Kosovo. An experienced linguist, she worked with the UN for almost four years as a political analyst. At the time of her death she was political affairs officer on the staff of Special Representative of the Secretary-General S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello. Watson's family and friends set up the Fiona Watson Memorial Fund to provide bursaries for final year students at her first university, Heriot-Watt, to enable them to spend a year with the UN or a similar international organisation. ==See also== *Attacks on humanitarian workers ==References== * Fiona Watson * Darwin college alumni organisation * Darwin college tribute * The Fiona Watson Memorial Fund Category:1968 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People educated at St Leonards School Category:Scottish philanthropists Category:Alumni of Heriot-Watt University Category:Alumni of Darwin College, Cambridge Category:British officials of the United Nations Category:Scottish terrorism victims Category:People killed in the Canal Hotel bombing Category:British people murdered abroad Category:20th- century philanthropists Category:2000s murders in Iraq Category:2003 crimes in Iraq Category:2003 murders in Asia ",
