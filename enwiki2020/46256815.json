    "text": "The PanAm Post is a libertarian website that specializes in international subjects as well as topics in the Americas from a free market perspective. The website focuses on multilingual and international content in order to follow \"the tradition of PanAmericanism\". It was founded in 2013 and its headquarters is in Miami, Florida. ==History== The site was founded in 2013 by Luis Henrique Ball Zuloaga, a Venezuelan businessman who is the cousin of Venezuelan politician Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. In an interview with Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed, Ball stated \"I have been very involved in Venezuela in public policy. PanAm Post has been more a vocation, something we wanted to do to defend freedom on the continent , rather than a business activity\", explaining that the publication is \"against socialism\". Following the founding of the PanAm Post, former editor-in-chief Fergus Hodgson explained how the PanAm Post was devoted to keeping up with social change and would be the \"front line of new media\". Hodgson said that the \"bloated and inefficient organizational structures\" of legacy media, along with governmental bureaucracies, were disconnected from the changing times. Its current editors- in-chief are the Venezuelan journalist, , and Colombian economist, . ==Demographics== The majority of visitors to the PanAm Post are from the United States, followed by Venezuela, Guatemala, Argentina, and Colombia, in that order. Most visitors are college educated and visit the website at home. ==Reception== According to Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences of Carnegie Mellon University, PanAm Post is \"an incredibly rich online site that covers news and offers excellent analyses of all regions in the Americas\". In 2019 and 2020, the PanAm Post was ranked in a Forbes article as one of the most prominent free-market magazines in the world measured by social media impact. ==References== ==External links== *PanAm Post on Facebook *PanAm Post on Twitter Category:American news websites Category:Free market Category:Pan-Americanism Category:Culture of Miami Category:2013 establishments in Florida Category:Spanish-language websites ",
