It landed at #2 on the weekly charts, being kept out of number one by a narrow 3,814 copies. Its total sales outsold the number one single's total sales that week. The single's debut sales and position were very high, compared to her previous single \"Key of Heart / Dotch\", which had low sales due to poor promotion by her record label, Avex Trax. Despite of competitions with many other major new releases, this single had continued its success. It sold double the amount of \"Key of Heart / Dotch's\" total sales, and outsold \"Nanairo no Ashita: Brand New Beat / Your Color\".
