    "text": "Ovidiu Zotta (1935\u20131996) was a Romanian writer of children's stories and an editor, scriptwriter and comic strip designer. In the late 1960s he created a character, \"Dim Dun\u0103reanu\" who was a superhero for children and has been called the \"Romanian James Bond\". Zotta wrote under a pseudonym, Sandu Alexandru, often simultaneously with his given name. ==Biography== Ovidiu Zotta was born on 30 May 1935. In 1948 comic book publications in Romania ceased and a ban prevailed until the early 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s a new genre of children's magazines emerged in such publications as Cravata ro\u015fie, Cutez\u0103torii, and Lumini\u0163a. The magazines were censored, but publication of comics soon soared. Zotta began drawing comics during this period as well as writing scripts. In 1967, using his pseudonym Sandu Alexandru, Zotta created a serial strip Aventurile lui Manolic\u0103, drawn by Bursch, along with the strip Vacan\u0163ele unui t\u00e2n\u0103r lini\u015ftit collaborating with Puiu Manu, who was using the pseudonym Vasile Baciu. This strip would be very important, as it was the birth of the comic strip character called \"Dim Dun\u0103reanu\". Dun\u0103reanu was an action hero created in the 1960s model. A communist children's hero, who was able to resolve serious situations without guns or blood but through his physical characteristics. Though Zotta created the character, other writers, like Puiu Manu wrote adventures for him. The character has been called the \"Romanian James Bond\". In the late 1970s, Zotta was acting as editor-in-chief of Cutez\u0103torii and was also writing and drawing comic strips under the pseudonym \"Sandu Alexandru\". In 1978, he wrote the screenplay for Dan Mironescu's filming of Jachetele galbene, a movie based on Zotta's novel, Opera\u0163iunea Hercule (Operation Hercules). He began to do a comic strip in the 1990s for Universul Copiilor called \"Aventurile lui Teddy Ted\" (The adventures of Teddy Ted). In addition to his work on comic strips, Zotta published children's literature. The literary magazine Observator Cultural listed Zotta as one of the leading writers of children's literature in Romania, among others such as Dumitru Alma\u0219, C\u0103lin Gruia, Gica Iute\u0219, Octav Pancu-Ia\u0219i, and Mircea S\u00e2ntimbreanu. Zotta died in 1996. ==Selected works== ===Books=== *To\u021bi b\u0103ie\u021bii s\u00eent r\u0103i, to\u021bi b\u0103ie\u021bii s\u00eent buni Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1970) (in Romanian) *O \u015fans\u0103 pentru fiecare Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1973) (in Romanian) *Opera\u021biunea Hercule Editura Albatros: Bucharest (1973) (in Romanian) *Alexandru cel argintiu Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1976) (in Romanian) * (\"O \u015fans\u0103 pentru fiecare\" Translated by Cseke G\u00e1bor) L\u00f3 a pinc\u00e9ben Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1976) (in Hungarian) * (\"To\u021bi b\u0103ie\u021bii s\u00eent r\u0103i, to\u021bi b\u0103ie\u021bii s\u00eent buni\" Translated by Natalie Alver) K\u00f5ik poisid on halvad, k\u00f5ik poisid on head Eesti Raamat: Tallinn (1979) (in Estonian) *Juc\u0103torul de rezerv\u0103 Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1980) (in Romanian) *Spadasinul de serviciu Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1984) (in Romanian) *Insigna de pilot Editura Ion Creang\u0103: Bucharest (1989) (in Romanian) ===Screenplay=== *\"Jachetele galbene\" (1979) ==References== Category:1935 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Ia\u0219i Category:Romanian children's writers Category:Romanian screenwriters Category:Romanian male writers Category:Romanian comics writers Category:Male screenwriters Category:20th-century screenwriters ",
