Harold Swanberg, George B. Lake, N. C. Barwasser, Norman Zolla, Florence Johnson, and James Dunn organized the Mississippi Valley Medical Editors' Association (MVMEA).Fishbein, Morris; Snively, WD (July 1965). \"Forewords to Swanberg's AMWA History\" (PDF). American Medical Writers Association. The MVMEA was absorbed by the new AMWA, which was formed at Springfield, Ill., September 29, 1948, during the meeting of the Mississippi Valley Medical Society in that city. At this time The Mississippi Valley Medical Journal was made the official publication of AMWA. During the 1948 meeting, Morris Fishbein, M.D., then editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, gave a two-hour course on medical writing at the meeting.Swanberg, Harold (May 2001). \"AMWA History, 1924\u20131948\" (PDF).

In summary, the statement asserts that, \"professional medical writing support helps authors and sponsors to disclose their research in peer-review journals and scientific congresses in an ethical, accurate, and timely manner, with the ultimate aim of advancing patient care.\" The statement describes the appropriate role of professional medical writers in the development of medical and scientific publications, including: * Articles and supplementary content (e.g., video abstracts) for publication in peer-reviewed journals * Abstracts, posters, and oral presentations for dissemination at scientific congresses\"AMWA\u2012EMWA\u2012ISMPP Joint Position Statement on the Role of Professional Medical Writers\" (Jan 2017). American Medical Writers Association. http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.amwa.org/resource/resmgr/about_amwa/JointPositionStatement.Profe.pdf Previously, AMWA published a position statement on the contributions of medical writers to scientific publications in the 2003 AMWA Journal. This article explained the work of the AMWA 2002 Task Force on the Contributions of Medical Writers to Scientific Publications as it prepared, adopted, and presented the position statement. The position statement addressed the controversy of guest authorship and the use of medical ghostwriters, particularly when pharmaceutical companies fund the research. Critics charge that the use of biomedical communicators encourages commercial bias. Advocates claim that professional biomedical communicators provide a valuable service that improves the quality and timeliness of publication of research. The debate centers around how to define authorship. In 2005, the World Association of Medical Editors tightened its policy on ghost writing of medical research papers after a US journal highlighted allegedly illegitimate ghostwriting practices. The New York Times reported on a study released by editors of The Journal of the American Medical Association that found a significant number of articles in top medical journals published in 2008 were written by ghostwriters. Cindy Hamilton (AMWA president at the time) replied to this article in a letter to the editor by stating, in part: Reuters has reported that some medical journal editors are resorting to computer forensics to help reveal ghost writers on manuscripts. Despite conflicting viewpoints on ghostwriting and guest authorship in medical communications, common ground can be found. This viewpoint was neatly summed up in the September 2009 issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings:' == See also == *American Association for the Advancement of Science *Board of Editors in the Life Sciences (BELS) *Council of Science Editors *Editors' Association of Canada *European Association of Science Editors *European Medical Writers Association *Society for Technical Communication *Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals == References == == External links == *American Medical Writers Association *Toolkit for New Medical Writers *Exploring a Career in Medical Communication: A Collection of Articles from the AMWA Journal *AMWA Position Statements *AMWA Online Learning *AMWA Essential Skills Certificate Category:Health care-related professional associations based in the United States Category:Professional titles and certifications Category:Science writing organizations Category:Organizations established in 1940 Category:Medical and health organizations based in Maryland Category:American writers' organizations AMWA Category:1948 establishments in Illinois ",
