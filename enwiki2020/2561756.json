    "text": "The ji (pronunciation: , English approximation: , ) was a Chinese polearm, translated into English as halberd, used in one form or another for over 3000 years, from at least as early as the Zhou dynasty until the end of the Qing dynasty. They are still used for training purposes in many Chinese martial arts. ==History== The ji was initially a hybrid between a spear and a dagger- axe. It was a relatively common infantry weapon in Ancient China, and was also used by cavalry and charioteers. In the Song dynasty, several weapons were referred to as ji, but they were developed from spears, not from ancient ji. One variety was called the qinglong ji (), and had a spear tip with a crescent blade on one side. Another type was the fangtian ji (), which had a spear tip with crescent blades on both sides.Jiang Feng-wei (\u8523\u8c50\u7dad), Chinese weapons dictionary (\u4e2d\u570b\u5175\u5668\u4e8b\u5178)Sadaharu Ichikawa (\u5e02\u5ddd\u5b9a\u6625), Dictionary of the Weapon (\u6b66\u5668\u4e8b\u5178) They had multiple means of attack: the side blade or blades, the spear tip, plus often a rear counterweight that could be used to strike the opponent. The way the side blades were fixed to the shaft differs, but usually there were empty spaces between the pole and the side blade. The wielder could strike with the shaft, with the option of then pulling the weapon back to hook with a side blade; or, he could slap his opponent with the flat side of the blade to knock him off his horse. ==Popular legend== The Ji is popularized through a historical character known as L\u00fc Bu. His weapon of choice was the Fang Tian Hua Ji (\u65b9\u5929\u753b\u621f). == Gallery == File:Chinese dagger-axe and related polearms.svg|Ge (two dagger-axes at left), ji (two variants at centre), and Song-dynasty ji (two at right) File:\u590f\u6840\u50cf.png|A king of Xia, Jie, holding an ancient ji File:Lu Bu at Hulao.png|L\u00fc Bu wielding his famed weapon File:Ji Dao.png|A qinglong ji (azure dragon ji) from the Qing-dynasty encyclopedia Gujin Tushu Jicheng ==See also== * Halberd ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Blade weapons Category:Chinese melee weapons Category:Pole weapons Category:Spears ",
