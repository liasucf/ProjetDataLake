By January 2015 almost nothing was left of the old stadium, which allowed foundation works for the new arena. The stadium was officially unveiled when Rapid Wien hosted Chelsea in a pre-season friendly on 16 July 2016. The first competitive match took place in the new stadium on 23 July 2016 when Rapid Vienna hosted SV Ried in the first round of the Austrian Football Bundesliga. Christoph Sch\u00f6\u00dfwendter scored the first competitive goal in the newly opened stadium in a 5\u20130 victory. ==References== .
