The lake is located in a valley in the Altai Mountains, near the very northern tip of Xinjiang and the province's borders with Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The lake was formed around 200,000 years ago during the Quaternary period as a result of glacier movement. The crescent moon shaped lake has an estimated water storage capacity of 53.8 billion cubic meters, coupled with an average depth of around 120 meters.http://www.silk-road-china.com/hanas.htm The Kanas River, flowing out of the lake, later merges with the Hemu River to form the Burqin River, which itself discharges into the Irtysh River at Burqin Town, the county seat of Burqin County. There is a large population of ethnic Tuvans and Kazakhs in the Kanas valley. While most of these people have maintained their traditional agricultural and nomadic life styles, many work in the developing tourism industry and have established facilities for orienteering, hiking, rafting, rock climbing, paragliding and camping.http://www.china.com.cn/travel/txt/2009-03/12/content_17427946_4.htm The scenic spot is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. About 117 different kinds of birds live along the lake. == Lake creatures == For several centuries there have been sightings of large lake creatures in the waters. First efforts in research of these legends were done by Yuan Guoying (Xinjiang University) who observed fish of enormous size in 1985. He and his students assessed that the fish could be 10 \u2013 15 m long and more than 4 tons heavy, with total population in excess of 50 individuals. Frequency of observation has increased in the 21st century, with the development of mass tourism. A video was taken and shown in the local Chinese media where numerous unidentifiable creatures can be seen.YouTube: Unknown creature in Kanas Lake According to CCTV10, the creatures living in the lake are speculated by Chinese scholar as giant Hucho taimen.http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTkwNDU2MDg=.html ==Gallery== File:LakeKanas.jpg|Kanas view File:Kanas glacier alpine.jpg|Kanas lake besides the alpine glacier File:Kanas silk road tour.jpg|Kanas lake tour File:Kanas Lake, China, LandSat image.jpg|Lake Kanas satellite Landsat 7, 2006 File:Quaternary age Kanas lake 2009-0827.jpg|The Kanas River, part of the Irtysh River to the Arctic Ocean, view from rafting boat == See also == * Ake Kule Lake * Tourism in China == References == == External links == * *CCTV News: Unknown Creatures Videotaped by An Amateur in Lake Kanas Category:Lakes of Xinjiang Category:AAAAA-rated tourist attractions Category:World Heritage Tentative List Category:Nature reserves in China LKanas ",
