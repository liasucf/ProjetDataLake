    "text": "This is a list of naval officer designators in the United States Navy. In the United States Navy, all active and reserve component officers are assigned to one of four officer communities, based on their education, training, and assignments: Line Officers (divided into Unrestricted Line or URL, Restricted Line or RL, and Restricted Line Special Duty or RL SD), Staff Corps Officers, Limited Duty Officers (LDO), or Warrant Officers (WO/CWO). Each community is further subdivided by primary occupation. Each occupation is identified by a designator. ==Definition== The officer billet designator codes are four-digit numbers used to identify the primary naval specialty qualifications required of the billet incumbent and to administratively categorize officer billets for proper management and identification. They serve as a manpower management tool when used in conjunction with the officer designator codes. These codes are entered in the Manpower Authorizations (OPNAV Form 1000/2) to indicate the categories of officers required for the billets. The first digit identifies the officer's community. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! First Digit !!colspan=\"2\" | Community |- | 1 ||colspan=\"2\"| Line (unrestricted and restricted) |- | 2 ||rowspan=\"4\" | Staff || Medical & JAG |- | 3 || Supply Corps |- | 4 || Chaplain Corps |- | 5 || Civil Engineer Corps |- | 6 ||colspan=\"2\"| Limited duty |- | 7 ||colspan=\"2\"| Warrant |} The second and third digits denote the officer's area of specialization within the line, staff corps, LDO, or warrant officer community. The final (fourth) digit denotes the officer's current type of commission. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Fourth Digit !! Commission |- | 0 || An officer of the regular Navy whose permanent grade is ensign or above. |- | 1 || An officer of the regular Navy whose permanent status is warrant officer or chief warrant officer (note that warrant officer [pay grade W-1] is not currently used in the U.S. Navy; all U.S. Navy warrant officers are commissioned as chief warrant officer-2 [pay grade W-2]; only designator 7840, cyber warrant officer of the line, is coded in manpower and personnel records for warrant officer-1 [pay grade W-1], as \"Code P\" per section 3, part A, of NAVPERS 15839I, of July 2018). |- | 2 || A temporary officer of the regular Navy whose permanent status is enlisted. |- | 3 || An officer of the regular Navy who is on the retired list, i.e., is on the permanent or temporary list of retired officers of the regular Navy. |- | 4 || No longer used. |- | 5 || An officer of the Navy Reserve, in either the Ready Reserve or the Standby Reserve category (NOTE: this code excludes designators with a 4th digit of 7, 8, or 9, i.e., those reserve officers who are not currently serving on the Full Time Support (FTS) Program, or appointed from the Naval Reserve Integration Program, or a member of the Retired Reserve, see immediately below). |- | 7 || An officer of the Navy Reserve on active duty in the Full Time Support (FTS) Program (previously known as the Training and Administration of the Reserve [TAR] program); includes officers of the FTS program rotated to other than FTS billets. |- | 8 || An officer of the Navy Reserve who was appointed in the Naval Reserve Integration Program from enlisted status or whose permanent status is chief warrant officer, warrant officer, or enlisted. |- | 9 || An officer of the Navy Reserve who is on the retired list, i.e., the Retired Reserve category of the Navy Reserve. |} Between fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 2005, all officers entering the U.S. Navy were awarded a Reserve commission (commissioned as ensigns, USNR). Legislation was signed that all Reserve officers on full-time active duty, previously designated by a \"5\" in the last digit of the designator, would be converted to a regular Navy commission by the close of fiscal year 2006. There is no distinction between USN and USNR officers, no matter what the commissioning source. All hold the same ranks, have the same responsibilities and authority, and enjoy the same privileges. As part of the U.S. Navy's Active\u2013Reserve Integration (ARI) initiative that \"operationalized\" the Navy's Reserve component, the term \"U.S. Naval Reserve\" was superseded by \"U.S. Navy Reserve,\" and the term USNR was discontinued as a matter of Total Force policy in 2005. All officers in the U.S. Navy now use the term USN with their rank titles. As used above, Full Time Support (FTS) program officers are reserve officers serving on either fixed or indefinite periods of active duty, while remaining reserve officers, under the authority of 10 USC 12310. The Full Time Support program exists to provide FTS for training, administration, recruiting, organization, and equipping the reserve components. ==(1xxx) Line Officers== ===Fully Warfare Qualified Unrestricted Line (URL) Officers=== Unrestricted Line Officers (URL Officers) are commissioned Officers of the Line in the United States Navy, both Regular Navy and Navy Reserve, who are not restricted in the performance of duty, and are qualified to Command at Sea the Navy's warfighting combatant units such as warships, submarines, aviation squadrons, and SEAL Teams. They are also qualified to command the higher echelons of those units, known as \"major commands,\" such as destroyer and submarine squadrons, aviation wings and groups, and special warfare groups. At the Flag Officer level, they also command carrier strike groups, expeditionary strike groups, task forces, and Fleet and Force commands. URL officers are also eligible to command shore installations, facilities and activities directly supporting the Navy's warfare mission.Mack, VADM William P. and Paulsen, CAPT Thomas D., The Naval Officer's Guide, 9th ed., Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, c1983Knott, CAPT Richard C., The Naval Aviation Guide, 4th ed., Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, c1985Mack, VADM William P. and Stavridis, CAPT James, Command at Sea, 5th ed., Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, c1999 {| |- | 111X | URL Officer qualified as a Surface Warfare Officer. |- | 112X | URL Officer qualified as a Submarine Warfare Officer. |- | 113X | URL Officer qualified as a Special Warfare Officer (SEAL). |- | 114X | URL Officer qualified as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Officer. |- | 130X | URL Officer previously qualified Naval Aviator or Naval Flight Officer whose operational flight rating has been terminated for aviation medical or flight performance reasons, or by the individual's personal resignation. |- | 131X | URL Officer qualified for duty involving piloting heavier-than-air, or heavier and lighter-than air types of aircraft as a Naval Aviator.
