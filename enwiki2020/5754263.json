    "text": "Dick's Picks Volume 24 is the 24th installment of the popular Grateful Dead archival series. It contains selections from the March 23, 1974 concert at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. The two-disc, vault release is mastered in HDCD. This was a significant show in Dead history, being the first to use an essentially complete version of the Wall of Sound setup. A short-lived sound system, it was diminished after less than two years due to high maintenance, transportation and assembly costs. They began work on it in 1973 and smaller versions of the system were used right up until this show. Also featured are the first performances of \"Scarlet Begonias\" and \"Cassidy\". ==Caveat emptor== Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own \"caveat emptor\" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording. The label for volume 24 reads: \"Dick's Picks Vol. 24 was mastered from the original 2 track analog source tapes recorded at 7.5 ips. Some minor sonic anomalies remain, but as much as is humanly and mechanically possible has been done to make this recording as good as it can be.
