Landmeistertum Preu\u00dfen == History == The office was created at the same time as the beginning of the conquest and the forcible Christianization of the Prussians in the summer of 1230. The first Landmeister, Hermann von Balk, received the Kulmer Land from the Duke Konrad I of Masovia as the nucleus of the Teutonic Orders in Prussia and started advancing north along the Vistula river. Dieter Zimmerling: Der Deutschen Ritterorden ; P. 111 His successors completed the conquest of the country under considerable setbacks and established the protection of the districts and the defeat of rebellious Prussians in fortified houses, the forerunners of the later brick fortresses known as Ordensburgs. The last Landmeister of Prussia residing in Elbing was Heinrich von Pl\u00f6tzke. In 1309, after the death of Pl\u00f6tzke, the office was united with that of the then grandmaster Siegfried von Feuchtwangen residing in Marburg Castle.
