    "text": "The Museo de Mujeres Artistas Mexicanas or MUMA (The Museum of Mexican Women Artists) is a virtual museum exhibiting the work of Mexican women artists, founded by the photographer Lucero Gonz\u00e1lez in 2008 to show the work of Mexican women in distinct fields of the arts. The museum's advisory board both curates the works exhibited and conducts research related to the artists and their work. The first exhibition of the museum featured the work of 50 artists including Leonora Carrington, Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Laura Anderson, Mariana Yampolvsky and Graciela Iturbide, and feminist artists like Helen Escobedo, Marta Lick, Silvia Navarrete and Lucero Gonz\u00e1lez, among others. It was produced with support from the Mexican Society for Women's Rights, AC, Semillas (Seeds), and is a non-profit project. In 2015 the museum had exhibited the work of 270 women Mexican artists. == Advisory board == The museum's multipdisciplinary advisory board members are: {| class=\"wikitable\" |Ang\u00e9lica Abelleyra |Journalist |- |Grace Quintanilla |Video artist |- |Helen Escobedo \u2020 |Visual artist |- |Karen Lamb |Art historian |- |Lorena Wolffer |Performance |- |Lucero Gonz\u00e1lez |Photographer and video artist |- |Magali Lara |Painter |- |Marta Palau Bosch |Visual artist |- |M\u00f3nica Mayer |Performance |- |Pilar Garc\u00eda |Art historian and curator |} == References == Category:Virtual museums Category:Arts organizations based in Mexico - ",
