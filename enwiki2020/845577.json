    "text": "The title Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec was accorded to full members of the Cabinet of Canada from the Campbell Ministry through the first months of Paul Martin government. Prior to the agency's renaming in 1998, the position was termed Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development \u2013 Quebec. Ministers responsible have included Jean Charest, Paul Martin, and John Manley. In 2002, Claude Drouin became the only Secretary of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec that was created to succeed from the former position of Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development \u2013 Quebec) which had existed since 1996 with Martin Cauchon in the position. When Prime Minister Paul Martin did away with the sub-Cabinet position of Secretary of State, he reverted the structure to how it had been constituted before 1996, with Industry Minister Lucienne Robillard assuming the title. After the 2004 Canadian election the portfolio was cut loose as an autonomous office, the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, and given to Jacques Saada. ==Ministers== Key: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=8| ===Ministers responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development \u2013 Quebec (1993\u20131998)=== |- !No. !Minister !colspan=2|Secretary !colspan=2|Term of office !Political party !Ministry |- ! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 1 | Jean Charest | colspan=2 rowspan=2| \u2014 | June 25, 1993 || November 3, 1993 | Progressive Conservative | 25 (Campbell) |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 2 | Paul Martin | November 4, 1993 || January 24, 1996 | Liberal | rowspan=2|26 (Chr\u00e9tien) |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 3 | John Manley ! style=\"background:;\"| | Martin Cauchon | January 25, 1996 || February 12, 1998 | Liberal |- ! colspan=8| ===Ministers responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec (1998\u20132004)=== |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 3 | John Manley (cont'd) ! rowspan=2 style=\"background:;\"| | rowspan=2|Martin Cauchon | February 13, 1998 || October 16, 2000 | Liberal | rowspan=3|26 (Chr\u00e9tien) |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 4 | Brian Tobin | October 17, 2000 || January 14, 2002 | Liberal |- | colspan=2|VACANT ! style=\"background:;\"| | Claude Drouin | January 15, 2002 || December 11, 2003 | Liberal |- ! style=\"background:;\"| 5 |Lucienne Robillard | colspan=2|\u2014 | December 12, 2003 || July 19, 2004 | Liberal | 27 (Martin) |} Martin Cauchon handled most day- to-day responsibilities for this portfolio as Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development \u2013 Quebec) from January 25, 1996 to February 12, 1998, and continued as Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec) until January 14, 2002.
