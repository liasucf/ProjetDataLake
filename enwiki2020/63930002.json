    "text": "The United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum is a history, sports and cultural museum located in the southwest part of downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, on S. Sierra Madre Street at the intersection of W. Vermijo Avenue. The Museum is a part of the City for Champions development project in Colorado Springs, which also is known as Olympic City USA. The Museum celebrates the incredible Olympic and Paralympic athletes who have represented Team USA. The Museum will open on July 30, 2020. ==History== Groundbreaking for the Museum was held on June 9, 2017. As the home of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, the Olympic & Paralympic Training Center and two dozen National Governing Bodies, Colorado Springs is an ideal home for the Museum. The Museum has an agreement with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee. ==Museum Description== The 60,000-square foot Museum is dedicated to U.S. Olympic and Paralympic athletes and their compelling stories. After guests enter the Museum and receive their credential, the Museum path starts with an elevator ride that takes all guests to the top floor. From there, a ramped path progressively downward to the main floor creates a parallel visit experience for all guests on the journey through 13 interactive galleries. The Museum is one of the most accessible and interactive museums in the world, designed so guests of all abilities experience all the Museum has to offer. Some of the inclusive designs and assistive technologies include open captions, audio-description tracks, assisted listening, universal keypads, RFID-triggered customizations, accessible exhibit spaces with ramped experiences and more. Team USA athletes were involved and consulted throughout the project to achieve our goal of authentic experience and inclusive design. The Museum is ADA compliant throughout. The Museum was designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro with an eye toward creating a building in motion and an overhead view of the Museum resembles a discus thrower in mid-throw. The exterior of the Museum is composed of nearly 10,000 unique diamond-shaped aluminum panels, with no two panels exactly alike. ==Olympic City USA== Athletes and coaches have long recognized Colorado Springs as the center of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic movements. The city is home to the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, the Olympic & Paralympic Training Center, two dozen National Governing Bodies and more than 50 National Sport Organizations. == References == == External links == * Category:United States Olympic Committee Category:Museums in Colorado Springs, Colorado ",
