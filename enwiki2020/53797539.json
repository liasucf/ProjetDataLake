    "text": "Formyl cyanide is a simple organic molecule with formula HCOCN. It is simultaneously a nitrile and a carbonyl. Formyl cyanide is the simplest member of the acyl cyanide family. It is known to occur in space in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud. ==Production== Formyl cyanide was first made by heating methoxyacetonitrile at 600 \u00b0C. Formyl cyanide can also be made by heating cinnamyloxyacetonitrile or allyloxyacetonitrile. In molecular clouds, formation of formyl cyanide is speculated to result from formaldehyde and the cyanide radical: :CH2O + CN\u2022 \u2192 HCOCN + H\u2022 In Earth's atmosphere, the pollutant acrylonitrile reacts with hydroxyl radical forming formyl cyanide, hydroperoxyl and formaldehyde: :CH2=CHCN + OH\u2022 \\+ 1.5 O2 \u2192 HO2 \\+ HCOCN + CH2O ==Reactions== Formyl cyanide reacts with water to form formic acid and hydrogen cyanide. ==Related== By formally substituting the hydrogen atom, cyanoformyl chloride, ClC(O)CN, and cyanoformyl bromide, BrC(O)CN are obtained. ==References== Category:Acyl cyanides Category:Nitriles ",
