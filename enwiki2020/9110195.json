It was led by Prime Minister Sergey Kiriyenko, appointed acting Prime Minister on March 23 and proposed to the State Duma for approvement on March 27, 1998. On April 10 and April 17 Duma disapproved him as Prime Minister twice (April 10: 143 in favor, 186 against, 5 abstained, April 17: 115 in favor, 271 against, 11 abstained), but on the third time on April 24 he was approved by the State Duma (251 in favor, 25 against) and appointed Prime Minister by the President. According to the Constitution of Russia, if the State Duma rejects the President's nomination three times, it must be dissolved and a parliamentary election held. According to the Russian legislation, the ministers were appointed by the President. On August 23, 1998 Yeltsin sacked the government after the 1998 Russian financial crisis had taken a dramatic turn on August 17, replaced Kiriyenko with Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting Prime Minister, although he had been neither a deputy nor even a member of the cabinet of Kiriyenko as required by law, and reappointed all the other ministers as acting ministers. Fourteen ministers survived the reshuffle (see Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet). ==See also== * 1998 Russian financial crisis ==Ministers== {| align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"text- align: center; background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" !Minister !Period of office |- | Prime Minister Sergey Kiriyenko | April 24, 1998 - August 23, 1998 |- | Viktor Chernomyrdin (acting) | August 23, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Economy and Finance Viktor Khristenko | April 28, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Monopolies and Public Utilities Reform Boris Nemtsov | April 28, 1998 - August 28, 1998 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Welfare and Mass Media Oleg Sysuev | April 30, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov | August 17, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister for Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov | May 8, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of the Interior Sergei Stepashin | April 28, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of State Property Farit Gazizullin | April 30, 1998 - September 28, 1998 |- | Minister of Emergencies Sergey Shoygu | April 28, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of Health Oleg Rutkovsky | May 8, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of Land Use, Construction and Public Utilities Ilya Yuzhanov | May 5, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of External Affairs Yevgeny Primakov | April 28, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of Culture Natalya Dementyeva | April 30, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of Science and Technology Vladimir Bulgak | April 30, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev | April 28, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of Education Alexander Tikhonov | April 28, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of Natural Resources Viktor Nekrutenko | April 30, 1998 - October 6, 1998 |- | Minister of Industry and Trade Georgy Gabunia (acting) | May 8, 1998 - July 23, 1998 |- | Yury Maslyukov | July 23, 1998 - September 11, 1998 |- | Minister of Railways Nikolai Aksyonenko | April 28, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Nationalities and Regional Affairs Yevgeny Sapiro | May 8, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Agriculture and Food Viktor Semyonov | April 30, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of Fuel and Energy Sergei Generalov | April 30, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Transport Sergei Frank | April 30, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Labor and Welfare Development Oxana Dmitriyeva | April 30, 1998 - September 30, 1998 |- | Minister of Finance Mikhail Zadornov | April 28, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Economy Yakov Urinson | April 30, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister of Justice Pavel Krasheninnikov | April 30, 1998 - September 25, 1998 |- | Minister, Chief of the State Tax Service Boris Fyodorov | May 29, 1998 - September 28, 1998 |- | Minister, Chief of Staff of the Government Nikolai Khvatkov | May 8, 1998 - August 28, 1998 |- | Igor Shabdurasulov (acting) | August 28, 1998 - September 14, 1998 |} ==External links== *Kiriyenko's Cabinet (in Russian) Kiriyenko Category:1998 in Russia Category:Cabinets established in 1998 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1998 ",
