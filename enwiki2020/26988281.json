A contemporary of John Long and John Bachar in a group they called the Stonemasters putting up daring new routes in the Idyllwild, California area, Sorenson pushed risk standards in rock and alpine realm. The son of a minister and a graduate of Biola University, he was deeply religious. Bruce Adams recounted in his obituary for Sorenson in Climbing, \"Tobin understood the risks he took might bring death at a young age. The thought often robbed him of sleep. However, he believed, as he told me, that God had created him to climb mountains, and thus he would climb to the best of his ability. He saw that his talent did not belong to himself but rather to God who entrusted him with it.\"\"\" Sorenson died from a fall during a solo attempt of the Mount Alberta's North Face on October 5, 1980. ==Sources== * Interview, Stonemastergear * Long on Adventure: The Best of John Long * A Short History of the Stonemasters, John Long * Alpinist ==References== Category:American mountain climbers Category:American rock climbers Category:Biola University alumni Category:Mountaineering deaths Category:Free soloists Category:1955 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People associated with the Eiger ",
