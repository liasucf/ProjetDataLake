    "text": "A Teza is one of several gymnastics moves introduced by French gymnast Elvire Teza in the 1990s, and subsequently named after her in the Code of Points. Most commonly, it refers to a variation of the Yurchenko loop with a full twisting handspring on the balance beam. However, there is one more move named after her on the beam, as well as two further elements on the asymmetric bars. == See also == *Yurchenko loop *Yurchenko (vault) == External links == *Teza(Balance Beam animation) Category:Gymnastics manoeuvres ",
