He is also a professor at the KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and head of the VIB Translational Immunology Laboratory. Liston obtained a PhD at the Australian National University in 2005. He completed a Postdoc at the University of Washington in Seattle, United States. He became Director of the Translational Immunology Laboratory in 2009. Liston is an advocate for both animal rights and also the use of animals in medical research. \"How can one be an advocate for both animal rights and for the use of animals in medical research?\u201d His main research interests are in the fields of neuroimmunology, autoimmunity, primary immune deficiencies and diabetes. Liston led the discovery of Pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis, \"Cause of rare immune disease identified\" a previously unknown auto-inflammatory disease caused by mutation in the gene MEFV. Liston is also known for identifying genetic fragility of pancreatic beta cells as a cause of diabetes. \"Genetics could affect beta cells in type 1 and type 2 diabetes\" In 2016, Liston led a team that found that cohabitation modified the immune system, making partners more similar to each other. \"Living with your partner makes your bodies more similar\u2014right down to the cells in them\" His research team has emphasized the role of the environment over genes in shaping the immune system. \"Environment shapes our immune system\" In 2017, his team identified novel mutations in the gene STAT2 which lead to primary immunodeficiency. \"New insights in genetic defect allow prevention of fatal illnesses in children\" Liston also led a team that developed a machine learning algorithm that identifies children with juvenile arthritis with almost 90% accuracy from a simple blood test. \"Profiling immune system in paediatric arthritis patients offers hope for improved diagnosis\" In the neuroimmunology field he identified a role for white blood cells in the development of the brain. \"New role for white blood cells in the developing brain\" Liston is the author of immunology-themed children's books, including 'Battle Robots of the Blood' and 'Just for Kids! All about Coronavirus'. \"Children's book 'Battle Robots of the Blood' launches\" ==Awards== In 2015, Liston won the Dr. Karel-Lodewijk Prize. In 2016, Liston was awarded the Eppendorf Young European Investigator Award for his work in elucidating key mechanisms by which the immune system avoids attacking the body while remaining effective against pathogens.\u201d Adrian Liston wins the 2016 Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators\". In 2015\u20132016, Liston was awarded a Franqui Chair to lecture at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles. \"Franqui Foundation Chairs\" In 2020, Liston was awarded a Churchill College Senior Research Fellowship. ==References== ==Sources== Category:British immunologists Category:Belgian academics Category:Belgian molecular biologists Category:Belgian immunologists Category:Australian immunologists Category:Australian National University alumni Category:Living people Category:Australian medical researchers Category:1980 births ",
