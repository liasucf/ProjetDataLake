    "text": "August Ivan Nepomuk Eduard \u0160enoa (; originally Sch\u00f6noa; 14 November 1838 \u2013 13 December 1881) was a novelist. Born to an ethnic German and Slovak family, \u0160enoa became a key figure in the development of an independent literary tradition in the Croatian language and shaping the emergence of the urban Croatian identity of Zagreb and its surroundings at a time when Austrian control was weaning. He was a literary transitional figure, who helped bring Croatian literature from Romanticism to Realism and introduced the historical novel to Croatia. He wrote more than ten novels, among which the most notable are: Zlatarovo zlato (Goldsmith's gold; 1871), \u010cuvaj se senjske ruke (Pirates of Senj; 1876), Selja\u010dka buna (Peasants' revolt; 1877), and Diogenes (1878). \u0160enoa was one of the most popular Croatian novelists at the time, and the author of the popular patriotic song \"\u017divila Hrvatska\". == Life == Statue of August \u0160enoa by Marija Ujevi\u0107-Galetovi\u0107, in Vla\u0161ka street, Zagreb He was born in Zagreb, then part of the Habsburg Empire, into a family of Slovak-German origin. His surname was originally spelled Sch\u00f6noa. His father was Alois Sch\u00f6noa, and mother was Terezija Rabacs, a Slovak woman from Budapest. He studied law in Prague. He also lived in Vienna for a while, but returned to Zagreb in 1866. He died in Zagreb at the age of 43. From 1874 to 1881, he edited the literary journal Vijenac (\"Wreath\"). He died from disease picked up after the 1880 Zagreb earthquake. == Work == In his novels, he fused national romanticism characterized by buoyant and inventive language with realistic depictions of the growth of the petite bourgeois class. This \"father of the Croatian novel\" (and modern national literature) is known for his mass Cecildemillean scenes and poetic description of oppressed Croatian peasantry and nobility struggling against foreign rule (Venetians, Austrians/Germans and Hungarians) and romanticised period from the 15th to the 18th century. It has become a commonplace phrase that \"\u0160enoa created the Croatian reading public\", especially by writing in a popular style. ==Legacy== In 2008, a total of 182 streets in Croatia were named after August \u0160enoa, making him the person with the seventh most streets in the country named after him. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==Sources== *August \u0160enoa at the Zagreb City Museum Category:1838 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Zagreb Category:Croatian people of German descent Category:Croatian people of Slovak descent Category:Croatian novelists Category:Croatian male writers Category:Male novelists Category:Burials at Mirogoj Cemetery Category:19th- century novelists Category:19th-century male writers Category:19th-century Croatian writers ",
