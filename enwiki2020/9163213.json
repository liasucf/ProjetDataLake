    "text": "Propanoic anhydride is an organic compound with the formula (CH3CH2CO)2O. This simple acid anhydride is a colourless liquid. It is a widely used reagent in organic synthesis as well as for producing specialty derivatives of cellulose. ==Synthesis== Industrial route to propionic anhydride involves thermal dehydration, driving off the water by distillation: :2 CH3CH2CO2H -> (CH3CH2CO)2O + H2O Another routes is the Reppe carbonylation of ethylene with propionic acid and nickel carbonyl as the catalyst: :CH2=CH2 \\+ CH3CH2CO2H + CO -> (CH3CH2CO)2O Propionic anhydride has also been prepared by dehydration of propionic acid using ketene: : 2 CH3CH2CO2H + CH2=C=O -> (CH3CH2CO)2O + CH3CO2H ==Safety== Propanoic anhydride is strong smelling and corrosive, and will cause burns on contact with skin. Vapour can burn eyes and lungs. ==Legal Status== Due to its potential use as a precursor in the synthesis of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, propanoic anhydride is regulated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as a List I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act.Drugs of Abuse Publication, Chapter 2 ==References== Category:Carboxylic anhydrides Category:Lachrymatory agents ",
