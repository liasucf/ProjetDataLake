He arrived in present-day Israel with his family when he was just two years old as part of the early migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel. Ipal\u00e9 enrolled in a theater school in London following his service in the Israeli Army. ==Career== He began his acting career by appearing in British television series and theater productions, including the television mini-series, Christ Recrucified, in which he played the title role of Jesus Christ. Ipal\u00e9 was cast as Joshua in the 1973\u20131974 British mini-series, Moses the Lawgiver, which starred Burt Lancaster as Moses. His work in Moses the Lawgiver earned attention from Hollywood and led to his later work in the United States. His American television credits during the 1970s and 1980s included Hawaii Five-O, Dynasty, Kojak, The Love Boat, MacGyver, Miami Vice and Charlie's Angels. In 1985, Ipal\u00e9 appeared in the British dramatic film, The Shooting Party, which starred James Mason and John Gielgud. That same year, Ipal\u00e9 appeared in the Israeli film, Gesher Tzar Me\u2019od (1985). Two years later, he co-starred in the 1987 film, Ishtar, which was a notorious critical and box-office failure.

In 2007, he appeared in Charlie Wilson's War. Ipal\u00e9 returned to Israel around 2012 after decades residing and working in London and Los Angeles. However, he was unable to recreate the professional success in Israel that he had enjoyed abroad. ==Death== Aharon Ipal\u00e9 died from cancer at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer on June 27, 2016, at the age of 74.
