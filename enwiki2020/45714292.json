    "text": "Social Bicycles Hamilton (commonly abbreviated SoBi Hamilton) was a bicycle sharing system located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It consisted of 825 bicycles at 129 hubs located in the Downtown, Westdale, and Dundas areas of the city. The system was operated by Hamilton Bike Share Inc, a local non- profit corporation, using equipment developed by New York-based Social Bicycles Inc. The system's operation is funded entirely from membership fees and advertising revenues. The service was terminated effective June 1, 2020. ==History== In December 2013, the City of Hamilton approved the implementation of a bicycle share system, with start-up costs covered by a $1.6 million grant from Metrolinx. The system officially launched on March 20, 2015, though a limited system of 200 bicycles had already been operating since January 2015. The service has been terminated, effective June 1, 2020. An expansion completed in late 2017, \"Everyone Rides Initiative\", added 12 more hubs, 75 more bikes, and a new system of discounted memberships for low-income residents. In June 2019, the firm added a tricycle to its fleet. In 2020 Uber backed out of their contract with the City of Hamilton, despite being under contract through February 2021. On May 28, after 14 hours in session, Hamilton city council decided to store all the bikes and equipment instead of funding the program's continued operation. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Community bicycle programs Category:Transport in Hamilton, Ontario Category:2015 establishments in Ontario ",
