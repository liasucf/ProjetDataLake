The family immigrated to Russia when he was a boy. He entered service as a lieutenant in the Russian Army in 1788, and was promoted to captain three months later. He served in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787 and continued to rise through the ranks, reaching colonel by the year 1800. He was the nephew of Count Marko Ivelich. Ivelich fought the French in Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition and then against the Swedes in the Finnish War of 1808, during which he was promoted to Major General and was awarded the Order of St. George for bravery. He participated in the Patriotic War of 1812 and served in multiple major battles, including Borodino, at which he was severely wounded. From 1813 to 1815 he was on leave to recuperate from his wounds, and was dismissed from service later that year. The emperor then granted him and his family a large plot of land with serfs in the Tobolsk Governorate. ==See also== *Serbs in Russia *Mikhail Miloradovich *Georgi Emmanuel *Nikolay Depreradovich *Ilya Duka *Ivan Shevich *Ivan Adamovich *Avram Ratkov *Nikolay Bogdanov *Fedor Mirkovich == References == Category:1772 births Category:Imperial Russian Army generals Category:Imperial Russian counts Category:Russian military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Imperial Russian people of Serbian descent Category:Year of death missing ",
