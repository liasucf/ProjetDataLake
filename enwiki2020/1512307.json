He was offered a position as an extra, but his father forbid him to go on the road. Three years later he joined a different small travelling troupe, and spent three years travelling through Europe with that troupe, first in Russia and then in Romania. He moved to London in 1886, then immigrated to the United States in 1890,Leftwich, Joseph (2007). \"David Kessler\". Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.
