It was expanded and incorporated in 1971, when ex footballer and supermarket chain operator Dave Whelan acquired a single sports shop in Wigan, and immediately opened a second sports goods outlet in his supermarket in Sutton, St Helens. The original JJB sports store was established by John Jarvis Broughton in the beginning of the 1900s, and later was purchased by John Joseph Bradburn. As these initials were all the same, the business was known locally as JJB\u2019s. When Whelan bought the store from Bradburn, he kept the JJB name. During the beginning of the 1990s, the store portfolio grew to stores totalling 120 by 1994, at which point the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In July 1998, JJB bought its largest domestic competitor Sports Division. The acquisition made JJB one of the largest sports retailers in the United Kingdom, focusing on sports clothing rather than sports equipment. It had got to a sales total of \u00a3372.97 million (US$636.60 million) in 1999. In July 2002, it had also opened a new branch in Amsterdam. In October 2002, Duncan Sharpe, chief executive of JJB Sports, committed suicide. Mr Sharpe had been with the company for nineteen years, and was the son in law of the chairman, Dave Whelan. By 2005, JJB had expanded to stores over 430 throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. On 8 June 2007, Mr Whelan sold his residual 29% stake in the firm for \u00a3190 million to Icelandic financial group Exista and Chris Ronnie, a sports retailer who previously worked at Umbro and Sports Direct.JJB founder David Whelan sells up, BBC News, 8 June 2007 On 19 October 2007, JJB bought a stake of 10.1% in Umbro, in an move to protect its stake in the market for shirts of England Football. This stake was sold in its entirety to Nike in March 2008. In December 2007, JJB announced that they had purchased the Original Shoe Company for \u00a35 million. JJB considered converting some of the smaller JJB High Street stores into OSC stores, keeping OSC as a separate division of the JJB group which would share JJB's buying, financing and marketing functions. In September 2008, JJB released a less than impressive set of interim results, which included a warning from the auditors raising doubts over JJB's future as a going concern. In October 2008, the value of JJB shares fell to less than 10% of the value, at the time of Dave Whelan's share sale to Chris Ronnie and Exista. This was partly in response to the interim financial report, and also as a result of Coface removing credit insurance. This was from debts owed by JJB to their suppliers.JJB Sports under pressure as insurers pull plug, The Daily Telegraph Three weeks later, a 34% share was purchased by Sports Direct. On 10 February 2009, JJB put their Qube and Original Shoe Company subsidiaries into administration, after failing to find a buyer.

He was the man who helped to turn the clothes retailer Next into one of Britain's largest retailers. ==Brands== In an effort to distance themselves from the majority \"own branded\" offering of main competitor Sports Direct, JJB's stock package mainly comprised products from the main sportswear suppliers, such as Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Reebok. However, JJB did operate its own brands, including 'Patrick' (menswear and football accessories), and 'Olympus' (womenswear and fitness accessories). ==Marketing== JJB Sports launched their shopping site, JJB Sports Store, with a view to expanding their market. The majority shareholder of JJB Sports Plc was Dave Whelan, but his 99% stake was sold off. JJB no longer operated the famous \"Soccerdomes\", nor any gyms or Fitness Clubs outside Ireland. Also, because of Dave Whelan's purchase of the Fitness Club, and founding of DW Sports Fitness in September 2009, JJB has lost its association with Wigan Athletic FC and Wigan Warriors RLFC. The stadium previously sponsored by the company has since been renamed the DW Sports Stadium. On 7 September 2011, JJB Sports launched a new major marketing campaign entitled \"Ready?\".
