He has lived in London since 1972 and has dual Israeli-British citizenship. Druks grew up in Tel Aviv where he studied at the High Institute for Painting and became involved in avant-garde art and theatre circles. He organized group exhibitions based around concerns for the natural environment, including Plus Air Pollution at the Gordon Gallery in Tel Aviv, and Environment Paintings and Sculptures at the Billy Rose Sculpture Pavilion at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1970. In the same year Druks received the Creative Artists Working Grant from the Sharett Foundation Fund, and had his environmental installations exhibited at the Israel Museum. In 1971, he participated in the 'Concepts and Information Show'.Yona Fisher, 'New Trends Among Israeli Artists', Studio International v 183 no. 942 March 1972 p. 125 By the late 1960s, Druks, having established himself as a leading young Israeli artist, decided to travel abroad. He arrived in Europe in the early 1970s, and after a period in Holland, settled in England where he became known for his conceptual work, with solo exhibitions in the 1970s at the Modern Art Oxford; The Whitechapel Gallery, London; De Appel, Amsterdam; The Centre Pompidou, Paris; Serpentine Gallery, London; documenta 6, Kassel; and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. Druks\u2019s print Druksland: Physical and Social (1974), a conceptual map, has become an iconic image in both Israeli and International art, and has been featured in numerous exhibitions, books, magazines, exhibition catalogues and posters. Since the early 1980s, Druks has concentrated primarily on painting, making works he says are \u201cdetails detached from a context\u201d that require time and active participation from the viewer. Druks' work has been exhibited in Cologne, Maastricht, Berlin, Brussels, Montreal, Bern, Buenos Aires, Caracas and S\u00e3o Paulo. ==Awards and recognition== * 1968\u201369, Scholarship for a Young Artist, Sharret Fund, America-Israel Cultural Foundation * 1970 The America- Israel Cultural Foundation, Sharett Fund Scholarship * 1970 America-Israel Cultural Foundation, Work Grant * 1970 Herman Struck Prize for Excellence, Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Israel * 1970 British Council Scholarship for Study in Britain * 1972 Aika Braun Prize for a Young Artist, Israel Museum, Jerusalem * 1973 Sandberg Prize for Israeli Art, Israel Museum, Jerusalem ==Education== * 1967 \u2013 Art Institute, Bat-Yam * 1967 \u2013 The High Institute for Painting, Tel Aviv ==Teaching== * Bezalel Academy of Art and Design ==Selected Solo Exhibitions== * Michael Druks, Dugith Art Gallery, Tel Aviv, 1968. * Michael Druks: Environment, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, October 6 - December 31, 1970. * Michael Druks: Projection on Photographical Situations, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, November 8, 1983 \u2013 December 31, 1983 * Michael Druks: Pictures, 1991\u20131992, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, October 1, 1992 \u2013 November 2, 1992 * Druksland, Haifa Museum, 2004. * Michael Druks, England & Co, London, 2013. * Michael Druks: View, Material, Thought, Loushy Art & Projects, Tel Aviv, 2013. ==Selected Group Exhibitions== * Concepts + Information, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, February 2 - March 5, 1971 * Affidavit: Idea-Process-Document, 6 Israeli artists, House Gallery, London, 1972. * 1st British International Drawings Biennale, Middlesbrough, 1973. * Flexible Geography & Location Piece, Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, 1973. * Off the Top of the Head, Art Meeting Place, London, 1974. * Punishments, In-Out Centre, Amsterdam;
