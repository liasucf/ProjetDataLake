He is the king of the west according to some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon and king of the south according to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum. The other three kings are Amaymon, Ziminiar and Gaap (although some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai and Gaap to be the kings of different cardinal directions, not giving detail on the cardinal point they rule). ==Other spelling== *Gorson ==See also== * Amaymon is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the East in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Ziminiar is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the North in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Gaap is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the South in the Lesser Key of Solomon. ==Sources== *S.
