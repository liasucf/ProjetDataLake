    "text": "In mathematics, more precisely in the theory of functions of several complex variables, a pseudoconvex set is a special type of open set in the n-dimensional complex space Cn. Pseudoconvex sets are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy. Let :G\\subset {\\mathbb{C}}^n be a domain, that is, an open connected subset. One says that G is pseudoconvex (or Hartogs pseudoconvex) if there exists a continuous plurisubharmonic function \\varphi on G such that the set :\\\\{ z \\in G \\mid \\varphi(z) < x \\\\} is a relatively compact subset of G for all real numbers x. In other words, a domain is pseudoconvex if G has a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Every (geometrically) convex set is pseudoconvex. When G has a C^2 (twice continuously differentiable) boundary, this notion is the same as Levi pseudoconvexity, which is easier to work with. More specifically, with a C^2 boundary, it can be shown that G has a defining function; i.e., that there exists \\rho: \\mathbb{C}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} which is C^2 so that G=\\\\{\\rho <0 \\\\}, and \\partial G =\\\\{\\rho =0\\\\}. Now, G is pseudoconvex iff for every p \\in \\partial G and w in the complex tangent space at p, that is, : abla \\rho(p) w = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\rho (p)}{ \\partial z_j }w_j =0 , we have :\\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho(p)}{\\partial z_i \\partial \\bar{z_j} } w_i \\bar{w_j} \\geq 0. If G does not have a C^2 boundary, the following approximation result can come in useful. Proposition 1 If G is pseudoconvex, then there exist bounded, strongly Levi pseudoconvex domains G_k \\subset G with C^\\infty (smooth) boundary which are relatively compact in G, such that :G = \\bigcup_{k=1}^\\infty G_k. This is because once we have a \\varphi as in the definition we can actually find a C\u221e exhaustion function. ==The case n = 1== In one complex dimension, every open domain is pseudoconvex. The concept of pseudoconvexity is thus more useful in dimensions higher than 1. ==See also== * Holomorphically convex hull * Stein manifold * Analytic polyhedron * Eugenio Elia Levi ==References== * Lars H\u00f6rmander, An Introduction to Complex Analysis in Several Variables, North-Holland, 1990.
