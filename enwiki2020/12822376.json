    "text": "The Scania K series is a series of chassis in Scania's city bus and coach range with longitudinally, straight-up mounted engine at the rear, replacing the K- (K94, K114, K124) and L-type (L94) chassis of the 4 series. The K series was first presented on Busworld 2005Scania at Busworld 2005: New range of Scania buses and coaches Scania 20 October 2005 in Kortrijk, Belgium and models were available from 2006. ==Type designation breakdown== ;Plant at which the vehicle was assembled (integral buses only) * C: former Kapena plant, Slupsk, Poland (K UB, K UA) * L: Lahden Autokori plant, Lahti, Finland \u2013 Interlink and OmniExpress (K UB, K IB, K EB) * T: Higer plant, China \u2013 A30 and A808 Touring coaches (K EB chassis only) ;Engine location * K: chassis with centrally mounted longitudinal engine behind rearmost axle ;Power code Approximation of the power rating in hp to the nearest ten. The power code has spaces on both sides. ;Type of transport * E: coach, long distance, high comfort * I: intercity, short to long distance, normal comfort * U: urban, short distance, normal comfort ;Chassis adaption * A: articulated bus * B: normal bus * D: double-decker bus ;Wheel configuration * 4x2: two-axle bus * 6x2: tri-axle bus * 6x2/2: tri-axle articulated bus * 6x2*4: tri-axle bus with steered tag axle * 8x2: quad-axle bus (K IB in Latin America only) * 8x2/2: quad-axle articulated bus (K IA only) ;Chassis height * L: low front, normal rear * M: low front and middle, normal rear (K UA only) * N: normal front and rear ;Suspension * B: air suspension front and rear, rigid front axle * I: air suspension front and rear, independent front suspension K230UB4x2LB would be a two-axle \"low entry\" city bus, while K480EB6x2*4NI would be a tri-axle long- distance coach with a steerable tag axle. Note: One might think that double- decker coaches are designated as (e.g.) K 440 ED6x2*4NI. But they still use K EB for some reason. ==Engines== When introduced, the K series was available with Euro IV-compliant 8.9-litre (8867 cc) 5-cylinder engines (DC9) with output of 230 hp (1050 Nm), 270 hp (1250 Nm) and 310 hp (1550 Nm) as well as the 11.7-litre (11705 cc) 6-cylinder engines (DC12) with output of 340 hp (1700 Nm), 380 hp (1900 Nm), 420 hp (2100 Nm) or 470 hp (2200 Nm), the latter being a DT12 turbo-compound engine. For the 5- and 6-cylinder engines Scania is using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to fulfill the legal Euro emission standards. In 2008 Scania released upgraded Euro V engines in order to meet these regulations. The 5-cylinder DC9 (later DC09) engines featured a larger bore and displace 9.3-litres (9291 cc) instead of 8.9-litres. The new DC13 engines feature both a larger bore and a longer stroke and therefore displace 12.7-litres (12742 cc) instead of 11.7-litres. Some engines also received slight performance improvements, for example the DC9 engine that outputs 310 hp (1550 Nm) was upgraded to 320 hp (1600 Nm). With the introduction of Euro VI engines in 2013, the DC09 outputs 250 hp (1250 Nm), 280 hp (1400 Nm), 320 hp (1600 Nm) and 360 hp (1700 Nm), while the DC13 outputs 410 hp (2150 Nm), 450 hp (2350 Nm) and 490 hp (2550 Nm).Scania at Busworld 2013 in Kortrijk, Belgium Scania 17 October 2013 Euro III, IV and V engines are still available for export markets. For alternative fuels, the 9.3-litre was available as the OC9 CNG engine with power outputs of 270 hp (1100 Nm) and 305 hp (1250 Nm), which from the introduction of Euro VI was replaced by the OC09 with power outputs of 280 hp (1350 Nm) and 340 hp (1600 Nm). The 8.9-litre is available as the ethanol fueled DC9 E02 with a power output of 270 hp (1200 Nm). ==Scania K EB== AAT Kings, Coach Concepts bodied K440EB The K280EB, K310EB, K320EB, K340EB, K360EB, K380EB, K400EB, K410EB, K420EB, K440EB, K450EB, K470EB, K480EB, K490EB and K500EB chassis have independent front suspension and are used for top end coaches.

A total of 60 units has been purchased. The buses have restyled front and rear as well as a newly developed driver's place. ===New Zealand=== In New Zealand, several operators have Scania K-series UB urban buses. Because of the additional weight of the 9-litre engine compared to the 7-litre units offered by other manufacturers, many (though not all) Scania urban buses are specified as 6x2 rather than 4x2. This helps reduce the operator's liability for road user charges, which are calculated by vehicle weight. Scania K-series urban buses may have tag axles at lengths where buses of other makes would not, e.g. NZ Bus's 2100 and 2200 series at approximately 12.0 m and only 42 seats. Scania K-series urban buses pioneered steerable tag axles in New Zealand, which became a requirement for buses between 12.6 m and 13.5 m in length. Because Scania K-series buses had a longer rear overhang than competing makes, the allowable overhang with a steerable tag axle was increased from 4.25 m to 4.5 m. The Scania K280 UB 6x2*4 and K320 UB 6x2*4 have been popular chassis for operators building high-capacity single-deck buses. New Zealand's first double-deck bus in regular urban service was a Gemilang-bodied Scania K310 UD 6x2*4. ===Singapore=== ====SBS Transit==== SBS Transit currently operates the largest fleet of Scania K-series buses in Singapore, with a total of 1,101 Scania K230UBs.
