    "text": "Esporte Clube Noroeste, commonly referred to as Noroeste, is a Brazilian professional association football club based in Bauru, S\u00e3o Paulo. The team competes in the Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A3, the third tier of the S\u00e3o Paulo state football league. Named after a now-defunct railway, Noroeste is a very traditional team within S\u00e3o Paulo state. Their home ground is \"Alfredo de Castilho\" stadium (supports approximately 18,840 people). ==History== Noroeste was founded on September 1, 1910, on the same day as Corinthians, the second most popular club in Brazil. The club became professional only in 1948. Before that year, it won the Campeonato do Interior, the most prestigious tournament among S\u00e3o Paulo countryside teams, in 1943. Ten years later (1953), Noroeste were promoted to Campeonato Paulista (state championship) first division. Until 1966, they played against many of the best teams of the country, including legendary Pel\u00e9's Santos. After that year, Noroeste has built a history of promotions and relegations to the 1980s. The club reached Campeonato Brasileiro (national first division) once, in 1978. The 1990s marked one of the hardest period in Noroeste history. They were relegated to Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A-3 (state third division) twice (1994 and 1999) and come back to S\u00e9rie A-1 (state first division) only in 2005, boosted by the wealth support from chairman Dami\u00e3o Garcia, elected in 2003. At 2006 season, Noroeste finished Campeonato Paulista in the fourth position, the best in whole club history. They were in Copa do Brasil (Brazil Cup) for the first time, but lost to 15 de Novembro (Campo Bom) yet on early stages. On S\u00e9rie C (national third division), Noroeste reached the third phase, but failed to promote. 2007 season ended with a good general performance for the club, despite first round disqualification in S\u00e9rie C. Noroeste finished 7th on Campeonato Paulista, their third best effort ever. The club was second to Guaratinguet\u00e1 in Campeonato do Interior and advanced to second round in Copa do Brasil, where runners-up Figueirense defeated them. The financial struggle when former chairman Dami\u00e3o Garcia ended Kalunga's sponsorship marked the end of an era. A succession of relegation brought the club from First to Last Division of state championship in only 5 years time. In 2015, for the first time in his centennial history, Noroeste played Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divis\u00e3o, the fourth and last division. Promotion was granted one year later after an irregular season, but enough to qualify among the four best teams. Noroeste has been disputing Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A3 since 2016. ==Stadium== Noroeste plays their home matches on Alfredo de Castilho stadium. Today's maximum attendance is of 18,840. Public record was 22,863 in a Campeonato Paulista match against Palmeiras. ==Achievements== * Campeonato Paulista: (S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship) ** Second Division Winners (3): 1953, 1970, 1984 (S\u00e9rie A-2) ** Third Division Winners (1): 1995 (S\u00e9rie A-3) * Copa Paulista de Futebol: (S\u00e3o Paulo State Cup) ** Winners (2): 2005, 2012 ==Current squad== As of March, 2020 ===Current staff=== ==Rivals== Noroeste main rivals are Mar\u00edlia and XV de Ja\u00fa. ==References== ==External links== * Esporte Clube Noroeste official site Category:Association football clubs established in 1910 Category:Football clubs in S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:1910 establishments in Brazil ",
