In 2001, the town had a population of 11,220,Lancashire Profile lancashire.gov.uk which decreased to 10,800 at the census of 2011. ==History== Great Harwood is a town with an industrial heritage. The Mercer Hall Leisure Centre in Queen Street, and the town clock, pay tribute to John Mercer (1791\u20131866), the 'father' of Great Harwood, who revolutionised the cotton dyeing process with his invention of mercerisation.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - subscription based, accessed 15 June 2011 The cotton industry became the main source of employment in the town, and by 1920, the Great Harwood Weavers' Association had more than 5,000 members.

Great Harwood used to have a lively and bustling market around the town clock in the main square. It was very popular, and drew people from across the county every week. It has declined in the last fifteen years, and almost disappeared, but having seen a small resurgence, it is now usually only a single stall which arrives every Friday with fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, clothes and pet supplies. More recently, there has been a very popular farmers market held each first Sunday of every month. Stalls include rare selections of organic meat, traditional Malkin pie, fish and shell fish stall, luxury body care stalls, European stalls, locally brewed beer stalls, art and crafts and jewelry stalls. Great Harwood has three supermarkets: Aldi, which opened in November 2010, Tesco, which opened in December 2011, and Morrisons, which was previously Co-Op, which originally opened in June 2001, which also opened in 2010.
