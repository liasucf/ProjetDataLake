In 2015, he became known worldwide after competing on the popular television show Britain's Got Talent. He subsequently released his version of Robyn's hit \"Dancing on My Own\" as a single, which reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and became the best-selling song that summer in the UK. In 2018, he collaborated with Leona Lewis on the single \"You Are the Reason\". ==Career== ===2013\u20132015: Career beginning and Britain's Got Talent=== On 15 August 2013, Scott won the talent competition Mail's Star Search, organized by Hull Daily Mail. He then joined a Maroon 5 tribute band, Maroon 4, and toured around the United Kingdom. In 2014 he formed the electronic duo, The Experiment with John McIntyre. The debut single, \"Girl (You're Beautiful)\", was released on 14 June. The duo performed the song on Good Morning Britain and BBC Look North, but after, broke up. On 11 April 2015, Scott's audition for the ninth series of Britain's Got Talent was broadcast on ITV. Just before his audition, his sister Jade also auditioned, but was stopped early on both of her songs by Simon Cowell. Jade received four \"No\" votes from Amanda Holden, David Walliams, Simon Cowell and Alesha Dixon. Despite obvious nerves at seeing his sister get rejected, Calum performed a cover of Robyn's \"Dancing on My Own\", which he had heard Kings of Leon performing on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in 2013. Following a standing ovation from the judging panel, Cowell pressed the Golden Buzzer giving Scott an automatic place in the live shows. Explaining his decision to send Scott straight to the semi-finals, Cowell said: After this audition, Scott received support from stars such as Little Mix and Ashton Kutcher. Following his appearance on the show's first episode, his Twitter followers jumped from 400 to over 25,000. The video of his audition has been viewed over 299 million times on YouTube. In the semi-final on 29 May, Scott performed \"We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off\" by Jermaine Stewart. Walliams commented \"You really sound like a recording artist\", whilst Alesha Dixon suggested that he could have \"success around the world\". He won the semi final with 25.6% of the vote, sending him straight through to the final. In the final on 31 May, Scott performed \"Diamonds\" by Rihanna and finished sixth out of 12 contestants with 8.2% of the vote. After Britain's Got Talent, Scott embarked on a series of shows around the United Kingdom, including Viking FM Future Star Awards, Flamingo Land Resort Fair, Westwood Cross Shopping Centre's tenth anniversary, Gibraltar Summer Nights, Hull Daily Mail's Star and Dartford Festival. ===2016\u2013present: Only Human=== Scott performing live at the Tabernacle, United Kingdom, in 2016. Scott released his cover of \"Dancing on My Own\" independently on 15 April 2016. It became a sleeper hit, first hitting number 40 in the charts in May and climbing into the top 40 despite little radio airplay apart from on West Hull FM. It was then added to Radio 2's \"C List\" and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart on 5 August. In August 2016, it was certified platinum in the UK, having sold over 600,000 copies. Scott announced on Twitter on 24 May that he had signed a record deal with Capitol Records for his debut album. Scott performed the song at television shows BBC Look North, Lorraine, Weekend, Late Night with Seth Meyers and Brazilian show Encontro com F\u00e1tima Bernardes. He also promoted the song on several radio stations, including BBC Radio Humberside, Viking FM, Radio Gibraltar, BFBS Radio and Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation. On 16 September, he released the promotional single \"Transformar\" with Brazilian recording artist Ivete Sangalo as official theme of 2016 Summer Paralympics Games. They performed the song at the closing ceremony of the Paralympics on 18 September. It was revealed in September 2016 that \"Dancing on My Own\" was the most downloaded song of the summer in the UK. In 2017, he toured the US and released the single \"You Are the Reason\". Also in 2017, he began working on his debut album, Only Human, which was released on 9 March 2018. A new version of \"You Are the Reason\" was released ahead of the album in early 2018 as a collaboration with Leona Lewis, and was performed by the two on The One Show in February 2018. In May, Scott released \"What I Miss Most\" as the fourth single from Only Human. In October 2018, Scott released a new single titled \"No Matter What\". Upon release, Scott said \" 'No Matter What' is without question the most personal song I have ever written and the one I am most proud of. It's a song born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of my coming out experience. What I love about this song is that it isn't just limited to a story of sexual identity, but about the relationship between parent and child and acceptance as a whole. This song didn't make my debut album because I simply wasn't ready at that time to give it to the world\". ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
