On May 25, 2011, AbsolutePunk reported that both singles were available for purchase through the iTunes store. On May 31, 2011, The Cinema released its third single titled \"Say It Like You Mean It\", and the track was available for download on iTunes the same day. The band released its forth and final single titled \"Picasso\" on July 28, 2011 . On August 25, 2011, The Cinema announced that the band's debut album will be released on September 13, 2011. Leighton Antelman had this to say about the record: \"I really wanted to do this new project and album for the Cinema, because it was just a very different way to approach writing and one I hadn't experienced yet. I've always started Lydia records from scratch and by myself. Matt and I started sending The Cinema songs back and forth, coast to coast, really kind of calling each other out to keep making the songs better and surpassing the previous versions. I think that the fact that we are both stubborn and pretty damn picky, if we're being honest here, is really what made the songs and album what they are today. I think fans of the band can expect much more music to come from The Cinema.\" The Cinema released the official track listing for their debut album on September 11, 2011. ==Reception== My Blood Is Full of Airplanes has received critical praise by music critics and fans. Absolutepunk gave the album a score of 88% approval and said, \"The opening \u201cSatellites\u201d gives us the first lick of The Cinema. Laden with a thick beat, the track is incredibly memorable and will be stuck in your head after the first listen. On the other hand, the following \u201cThe Wolf\u201d and single \u201cKill It\u201d rely less on background effects, as Antelman really shines on each of these. At this point, it becomes clear that this record is just downright fun and catchy, while still having the edge we all love Lydia for.\" They went on to say, \"In the end, the swift production proves to the be the backbone of the record, as tracks such as \u201cBanker\u201d prove the skill of programmer Matt Malpass, with the chorus wrapping perfectly around the electronic spine of the song. The final title track also dictates this skill more than ever. Being the softest song on the record, \u201cMy Blood Is Full of Airplanes\u201d allows the chemistry between Malpass behind the tech and Antelman behind the mic to surface. The Cinema truly escalates the talent of Leighton Antelman and Matt Malpass to a different level.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Leighton Antelman \u2013 vocals * Matt Malpass \u2013 programming, production ==References== Category:2011 debut albums Category:The Cinema albums ",
