Hy\u016bga supported Japanese forces in the early 1920s during the Siberian intervention in the Russian Civil War. In 1923, she assisted survivors of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The ship was partially modernised in two stages in 1927\u20131928 and 1931\u20131932, during which her forward superstructure was rebuilt in the pagoda mast style. Hy\u016bga was reconstructed in 1934\u20131936, improvements being made to her armour and propulsion machinery. Afterwards, she played a minor role in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Despite the expensive reconstruction, the ship was considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War, and did not see significant action in the early years of the war. After the loss of most of the IJN's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942, she was rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give her the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes; lack of aircraft and qualified pilots meant that Hy\u016bga never operated her aircraft in combat. She participated in the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o in late 1944, where she helped to decoy the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterwards, the ship was transferred to Southeast Asia, occasionally serving as a flagship. In early 1945, Hy\u016bga participated in Operation Kita, during which she transported petrol and other strategic materials back to Japan. The ship was then reduced to reserve until she was sunk during American airstrikes in July. After the war, Hy\u016bga was scrapped in 1946\u20131947. ==Design and description== American ship-recognition drawing of the Ise-class battleships before their conversion The Ise class was designed as an improved version of the preceding . The ships had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Lengerer March 2007, p. 9 They displaced at standard load and at deep load, roughly more than the earlier ships. Their crew consisted of 1,360 officers and ratings. During the ships' modernisation in the 1930s, their forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod masts to create a pagoda mast. Both ships were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the extra armour. These changes increased their overall length to ,Chesneau, p. 171 their beam to and their draught to . Their displacement increased over to at deep load.Lengerer 2009, pp. 50\u201351 The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men. ===Propulsion=== The Ise-class ships had two sets of direct- drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 24 Kampon Ro G\u014d water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of and give the ships a speed of . Hy\u016bga reached from during her sea trials.Lengerer 2011, pp. 21\u201322 Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil, and the ships carried enough of both to give them a range of at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 26 During their 1930s modernisation, the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kampon oil- fired boilers. The turbines were replaced by four geared Kampon turbines with a designed output of intended to increase their speed to . The fuel storage of the ships was increased which gave them a range of at , despite the additional weight. ===Armament=== Installation of a 35.6-centimetre gun in Hy\u016bgas No.3 gun turret The twelve Type 41 guns of the Ise class were mounted in three pairs of twin-gun, superfiring turrets that were numbered one through six from front to rear. The first pair was forward of the main superstructure, the second pair was amidships, and the last ones were aft of the rear superstructure.Lengerer 2011, pp. 24\u201326, 30 The ships' secondary armament consisted of twenty Type3 guns in single mounts. Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields.Lengerer 2011, pp. 33\u201334 Anti-aircraft defence was provided by four 40-calibre 3rd Year Type 8-centimetre (3 in) anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with six submerged torpedo tubes, three on each broadside.Gardiner & Gray, p. 230 In 1931\u20131933 the AA guns were replaced with eight Type 89 dual-purpose guns, placed beside the forward superstructure in four twin-gun mounts.Lengerer March 2007, p. 12 Two twin-gun mounts for license-built Vickers two-pounder () light AA guns were also added while the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed.Hackett & Kingsepp During the mid-1930s reconstruction, the torpedo tubes were removed, and the Vickers two-pounders were replaced by twenty license-built Hotchkiss Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to naval historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts \"lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast\".Stille, p. 11 During the reconstruction, the forward pair of 14-centimetre guns in the forecastle were removed. ===Protection=== The Ise-class ships' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of of Vickers cemented armour amidships; below it was a strake of armour. The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel totalling thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel, but only thick in total.Lengerer 2006, pp. 28\u201330; Lengerer 2011, p. 36 The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of on the face and 76 mm on the roof.Lengerer March 2007, p. 16 The casemate armour was thick and that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm.Lengerer 2006, pp. 28\u201330 ==Construction and career== Hy\u016bga shortly after completion Hy\u016bga, named after Hy\u016bga Province, one of the traditional provinces of Japan, was laid down at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipyard in Nagasaki on 6May 1915 and launched on 27 January 1917. Captain Shigeushi Nakagawa assumed command on 30 April and the ship was completed on that same day, too late for service in World War I.Silverstone, p. 330 Hy\u016bga was then assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. Captain Kinzaburo Mimura relieved Nakegawa on 10 November. An explosion in No.3 gun turret killed 11 crewmen and wounded another 25 during a gunnery exercise on 24 October 1919. Mimura was relieved in his turn by Captain Genjiro Katsuki on 20 November. Hy\u016bga accidentally collided with and sank the schooner Hiromiya Maru, killing two of the sailing ship's crew, on 21 July 1920. On 29 August, the ship began the first of numerous patrols off the Siberian coast and in northern waters in support of Japan's Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. Captain Hidesaburo Ishikawa replaced Katsuki on 20 November and he was replaced by Captain Genji Ide on 20 November 1921. The ship aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake in September 1923. From the early 1920s through the late 1930s, Hy\u016bga often cruised off the coast of China. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s. The ship was overhauled in 1927\u20131928, during which her forward superstructure was enlarged and her aviation facilities improved. Beginning on 27 March 1932, she patrolled off the coast of China after the First Shanghai Incident, together with her sister ship and the battlecruisers and . On 14 June 1932, she was taking part in an exercise off Kyushu near the Mishima Islands in which a group of submarines practiced a mock combined attack on the 1st Battleship Division when the submarine unexpectedly surfaced in front of her. Hy\u016bga, zigzagging at , took evasive action at the last minute and managed to avoid a direct collision with the stationary I-4, although Hy\u016bga suffered minor damage to her hull plating when her bow grazed I-4\u2032s hull. Beginning on 24 October 1934, Hy\u016bga was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal and underwent an extensive reconstruction and modernisation that lasted until 7September 1936. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship ferried two battalions of the 3rd Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force to Port Arthur, China, on 19 August 1937. She began the first of her patrols off the southern Chinese coast on 15 September that lasted until early 1941. On 30 June 1940 Hy\u016bga served as the flagship for the Emperor of Manchuoko, Henry Pu-yi, during his state visit to Japan. Together with Ise, the ship was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November. Captain Noboru Ishizaki assumed command on 1September 1941. ===Start of the Pacific War=== When full-scale war started for Japan on 8 December,Japan Standard Time is 19 hours ahead of Hawaiian Standard Time, so in Japan, the attack on Pearl Harbor happened on 8December. the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. Captain Chiaki Matsuda relieved Ishizaki on 20 February 1942. Together with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division, Hy\u016bga pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April. In May 1942 while conducting gunnery practice along with Nagato and Mutsu, the breech of Hy\u016bgas left-hand gun in her No.5 turret exploded, killing 51 crewmen. The two aft magazines were rapidly flooded to save the ship and she returned to Kure for repairs. The turret was deemed not to be repairable and was removed. A circular plate of armour was welded over the barbette and three triple mounts for 2.5 cm AA guns were installed there. While under repair, the ship was fitted with one of the first experimental Type 22 surface-search radar sets in the IJN, but it was removed shortly afterwards. Hy\u016bga and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).Rohwer, pp. 168\u2013169Parshall & Tully, p. 454 Commanded by Vice- Admiral Shir\u014d Takasu, the division was composed of Japan's four oldest battleships, including Hy\u016bga, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.Parshall & Tully, p. 46 ===Conversion to hybrid carriers=== Ise after her 1944 reconstruction The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June severely limited the ability of the IJN to conduct operations and alternatives were sought. Plans for full conversions of battleships into aircraft carriers were rejected on the grounds of expense and, most critically, time, so the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets from the Ise-class ships and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two rotating catapults.Lengerer 2009, pp. 39\u201340 Matsuda was relieved by Captain Sueo Obayashi on 10 December and he was relieved in turn on 1May 1943, the same day that the conversion officially began. Work actually began two months later. The ship's No.6 turret and the barbettes for No.5 and6 turrets were replaced by a hangar surmounted by a flight deck. This was not long enough to permit the launch of aircraft or their recovery. Two catapults were installed and the existing crane was moved to the flight deck. This was fitted with an extensive system of rails to link each catapult, the storage positions on the deck and the \"T\"-shaped aircraft lift that moved aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. It had a capacity of nine aircraft, with eleven more stowed on deck, and one on each catapult for a total of twenty-two.Lengerer 2009, pp. 45\u201349 The ship's air group was intended to consist of a dozen each Yokosuka D4Y Suisei dive bombers (Allied reporting name \"Judy\"), modified for catapult launching, and Aichi E16A reconnaissance floatplanes (Allied reporting name \"Paul\"), of which two to three of each were reserves. The former had to land either on a conventional carrier or on land bases, whereas the E16A could be hoisted back aboard using a crane, after landing on the water near the ship.Lengerer 2009, pp. 51\u201353 During the conversion, all of the 14 cm guns were removed and the ship's anti-aircraft suite was heavily reinforced. The eight 12.7 cm Type 89 guns were supplemented with four twin mounts and the existing 2.5 cm Type 96 AA twin-gun mounts were replaced by 19 triple-gun mounts for a total of 57 weapons.Lengerer 2009, p. 43 These changes increased the ship's overall length to and the removal of the heavy gun turrets and their barbettes reduced her displacement to at deep load, despite the addition of more fuel oil storage. The extra fuel increased Hy\u016bgas range to . The weight reductions decreased her draught to . The crew now numbered 1,463 officers and enlisted men. The rebuild was officially completed on 18 November and Captain Tomekichi Nomura assumed command on 5December as the ship was working up. Hy\u016bga served as a training ship for most of the first half of 1944. On 25 February, Battleship Division2 was assigned to the direct control of the Combined Fleet. The sisters were then transferred to the Third Fleet and assigned to the newly reformed Fourth Carrier Division on 1May. That same day the 634th Naval Air Group was formed and assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division. On 24 May, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 24 additional Type 96 AA guns in eight triple mounts, which brought her total to 104 guns. On 7June, a pair of improved Type 22 surface-search radars were installed. A pair of Type 13 early-warning radars and an E27 radar detector were probably also fitted. On 23 June, the sisters conducted their first catapult training, each with four D4Ys and six E16As aboard; subsequent sessions were conducted on 21 July and 31 August.Lengerer September 2007, p. 22 Two days later, Hy\u016bga became the flagship of the Fourth Carrier Division, now commanded by the recently promoted Rear Admiral Matsuda. In September, six racks of 30-tube 12.7 cm anti-aircraft rocket launchers were added. Training of the D4Y and E16A aircrew was slowed by technical problems and was generally conducted from land bases. By 1October the 634th had on strength 17 D4Ys, of which six were serviceable, and 18 E16As, of which 16 were operable.Lengerer September 2007, p. 23 ===Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o and afterwards=== Hy\u016bga on her sea trials in November 1943 after her conversion After the Americans began attacking Japanese installations in the Bonin Islands on 10 October 1944, the aircraft of the Fourth Carrier Division were ordered to prepare for combat by the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda. Two days later, the 634th Naval Air Group was reassigned to the Second Air Fleet and began flying to bases in southern Kyushu; among these were nine D4Ys and a dozen E16As assigned to Ise and Hy\u016bga. On 14 October they attacked the aircraft carriers of Task Force 38 near Formosa with little effect and heavy losses.Lengerer 2009, p. 53 The following day Nomura was promoted to rear admiral. The ships of the Fourth Carrier Division were assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisabur\u014d Ozawa. The Main Body's role was to act as decoys to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa ordered an air strike launched by the Third Carrier Division (Hy\u016bga and Ise had no aircraft aboard) to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them, but Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day.Polmar & Genda, pp. 420, 422, 428 On the morning of 25 October, Hy\u016bga was positioned near the light carriers and to protect them with her anti-aircraft guns. Her radar picked up the first of five American airstrikes at a range of at 07:13, but the battleship was not a primary target. Fragments from near misses by bombs damaged the ship's anti-torpedo blister and she developed a 5\u00b0 list that was easily corrected. Despite Hy\u016bgas protection, Chiyoda was set afire and her engines were disabled. Matsuda ordered the battleship and the light cruiser to tow the crippled carrier, but Hy\u016bga was unable to do so and rejoined the main body at 18:30. The American submarine spotted the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvered to attack, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa ordered Matsuda to take his ships south to defend Isuzu and her escorting destroyers that were attempting to rescue Chiyodas survivors, despite gunfire from a group of four American cruisers. Unable to locate either group of ships, Ozawa ordered Matsuda to reverse course at 23:30 and head for Amami \u014cshima to refuel. Despite being spotted by American submarines en route, the division arrived safely on 27 October. That same day Ozawa transferred his flag to Hy\u016bga. After leaving the island the following day, they were unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before their arrival at Kure on the 29th. Between 29 October and 8 November, the catapults were removed to improve the firing arcs of No.3 and No.4 turrets. Hy\u016bga and Ise departed on 11 November, loaded with troops and munitions for Manila, capital of the Philippines, but news was received of heavy American air attacks on Manila and they were diverted to the Spratly Islands. They arrived on 14 November and their cargo was unloaded so it could be transshipped to the Philippines. The 4th Carrier Division was transferred to the 2nd Fleet the following day. Reinforced by the battleship and three cruisers, the sisters proceeded on to Lingga Island, near Singapore, on 20 November. They arrived two days later and remained there until 12 December when they departed for Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, where they were on standby for an attack on an American supply convoy bound for the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima, commander of the 5th Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard Hy\u016bga two days later. The attack was cancelled on the 30th and the ships sailed for Singapore where they arrived on 1January 1945 before continuing on to Lingga. That same day the Fourth Carrier Division was transferred to the Southwest Area Fleet and Shima hauled his flag down. On 6February, the division sailed for Singapore to participate in Operation Kita. The sisters and the light cruiser were loaded with critically needed strategic war supplies (oil, rubber, tin, zinc, and mercury) and 1,150 surplus oil workers to be ferried back to Japan. ===Final role=== The division sailed from Singapore on 10 February and was spotted by the British submarine the following day. Tantalus was forced to submerge by a maritime patrol aircraft and was unable to attack. On 13 February the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the ships as did the submarine . Later that afternoon, \u014cyodo launched one of her floatplanes which spotted the submarine on the surface about ahead of the convoy. Hy\u016bga opened fire with her main guns and forced Bashaw to submerge when one of her shells landed within of the submarine. The convoy reached the Matsu Islands, off the Chinese coast, on the 15th and was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before they reached Zhoushan Island, near Shanghai, that night. The convoy reached Kure on 20 February, having evaded or escaped pursuit by twenty-three Allied submarines along the way. Hy\u016bga sunk in shallow waters This was Hyuga by Standish Backus (watercolour, 1946) depicts her on the bottom at Niro Bay The 4th Carrier Division was disbanded on 1March and Hy\u016bga was reduced to first-class reserve. Rear Admiral Kiyoshi Kusagawa relieved Nomura that same day. From this time until the surrender of Japan, Hy\u016bga was anchored in Hiroshima Bay without fuel or aircraft. More than 240 American carrier-based aircraft from Task Force 58 attacked Kure on 19 March and the ship was hit by three bombs, killing 37 and wounding 52 crewmen. Her anti-aircraft guns claimed to have shot down a single Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber during the attack. Re-designated as a fourth-class reserve ship on 20 April, Hy\u016bga was towed to a new position within Hiroshima Bay and heavily camouflaged. She was later attacked during the bombing of Kure on 24 July and was struck by 10 bombs that blew off part of her stem, destroyed her bridge and started major fires. Over 200 sailors were killed, including Kusagawa, and 600 wounded by the attack. Progressive flooding caused the ship to sink in shallow water over the next several days and her crew was ordered to remove all easily accessible weapons. Hy\u016bga was unsuccessfully attacked by 24 USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers on the 29th and abandoned three days later by her crew. She was removed from the Navy List on 20 November 1945. Her wreck was raised and broken up by the Kure Dockyard of the Harima Z\u014dsen Corporation from 2July 1946 to 4July 1947. ==Notes== ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * * * * (contact the editor at lars.ahlberg@halmstad.mail.postnet.se for subscription information) * * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Maritimequest.com: Ise photo gallery * IJN Hy\u016bga, World War II Database. * Jones, Daniel H. \"IJN Ise/Hyuga BBCV,\" Ship Modeling Mailing List. * Slade, Stuart. \"The Japanese Ise and Hyuga Hybrid Battleship-Carriers.\" January 27, 1999. * Ise et Hy\u016bga Cuirass\u00e9 porte-avions 2iemeGuerre.
