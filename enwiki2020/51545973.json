    "text": "The 1968 Oregon State Beavers football team represented Oregon State University during the 1968 NCAA University Division football season. Home games were played on campus in Corvallis at Parker Stadium, with one at Civic Stadium in Portland. Under fourth-year head coach Dee Andros, the Beavers were 7\u20133 overall and 5\u20131 in the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8). They were fifteenth in the final AP Poll, and outscored their opponents, 285 to 179. The 17\u201313 loss at USC in November decided the conference title and the Rose Bowl berth. Prior to the 1975 season, the Pac-8 and Big Ten conferences allowed only one postseason participant each, for the Rose Bowl. The Beavers were led on offense by quarterback Steve Preece and fullback Bill Enyart, nicknamed \"Earthquake.\" Center John Didion was a consensus All-American. ==Schedule== Source:College Football @ Sports-Reference.com.
