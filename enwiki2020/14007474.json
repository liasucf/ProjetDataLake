    "text": "Anders Engbergs was a dansband in Skara, Sweden, reestablished in 1994 when Lotta & Anders Engbergs orkester split up into two bands, Anders Engbergs and Lotta Engbergs, three years after the divorce of husband Anders Engberg and wife Lotta Engberg. Anders Engbergs had also been the name of the unsplit band prior to Lotta Engberg joining it in 1989. One of the more famous singers in its lineup up to 1988 was Stefan Borsch. Bj\u00f6rn Hedstr\u00f6m, who was one of Anders Engbergs' singers, participated in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1995 with the song \"Du \u00e4r dr\u00f6mmen jag dr\u00f6mt\". Anders Engbergs had some Svensktoppen hits, but never achieved the same level of successes as Lotta Engbergs. Charlotte Perrelli (then known as Charlotte Nilsson) had her breakthrough while in this band, laying the foundation for her later successes in Melodifestivalen as a solo artist. Another member was Martin Rydnemalm, who later played the guitar and saxophone in Kim & Hallo. In 1998 the band won the contest \"Dansbandsl\u00e5ten\" with the song \"N\u00e4r k\u00e4rleken sl\u00e5r till\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Gl\u00f6m inte bort - 1995 *Lova mig - 1996 ==Svensktoppen songs== *Gl\u00f6m inte bort - 1994 *Du \u00e4r dr\u00f6mmen jag dr\u00f6mt - 1995 *Ge dej tid - 1995 *Gl\u00f6m inte bort - 1994 *Av hela mitt hj\u00e4rta - 1996 *K\u00e4rleken i dina \u00f6gon - 1998 *N\u00e4r k\u00e4rleken sl\u00e5r till - 1999 *Tusen \u00e5r - 2000 ===Songs failing to enter the chart=== *En bl\u00e5 sommardag - 1997 *Minnenas v\u00e4rld - 1997 *\u00c4r du min nu - 1999 *Det \u00e4r sommaren som vaknat - 1999 ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Dansbands Category:1994 establishments in Sweden ",
