    "text": "\"Contenders\" is a song by the British new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in 1986 as the first single from their fourth studio album Pleasure One. It was written and produced by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware. The song reached No. 80 in the UK and spent four weeks on the chart. It also reached No. 6 on the U.S. Billboard Dance/Club Play Singles Chart. A music video was filmed to promote the single. ==Critical reception== Upon release, Simon Reynolds of Melody Maker commented: \"This one practically hurls itself off the ropes at you, solid funk brawn but light on its feet, bobbing and weaving, jabbing and pummeling and always on the attack, but, somehow, failing to deliver that hook to floor you completely. The killer blow never comes.\" Aaron Badgley of AllMusic stated: \"\"Some of the Pleasure One songs are among their best, including the wonderful \"Trouble\" and the opening track, \"Contenders.\"\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"Contenders\" - 4:28 #\"Excerpts From \"Diary of a Contender\" - 5:24 ;12\" single #\"Contenders (Dance version)\" - 6:23 #\"Excerpts From 'Diary of a Contender'\" - 5:24 #\"Contenders (Full length version)\" - 5:19 ;12\" single (US release) #\"Contenders (Dance version)\" - 7:45 #\"Contenders (Edited version) \" - 3:10 #\"Contenders (Instrumental version)\" - 5:12 #\"Contenders (Go Go version)\" - 6:39 ;12\" single - (limited edition gatefold) #\"Contenders (Dance version)\" - 6:22 #\"Excerpts From 'Diary of a Contender'\" - 5:24 #\"Penthouse & Pavement\" - 6:33 #\"Megamix (Edit)\" - 6:36 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1986-87) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|80 |- |align=\"left\"|US Dance/Club Play Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|US Hot Dance Music Sales | style=\"text-align:center;\"|23 |} == Personnel == ;Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory - lead vocals, backing vocals, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer * Martyn Ware - sampler (Emulator II), Mellotron, SP 12 programming, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer * Ian Craig Marsh - Fairlight programming, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer ;Additional personnel * Carol Kenyon - backing vocals * Tim Cansfield - guitar * Phil Spalding - bass * Brian Tench - mixing * Tim Hunt, Ben Knape - engineers * John 'Tokes' Potoker - remixer of \"Penthouse & Pavement\" * Sanny X - remixer of \"Megamix (Edit)\" ==References== Category:1986 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh ",
