Content analysis: An introduction to its methodology. Sage, 2012. and on human-system communication.Nielsen, Jakob. Usability engineering. Elsevier, 1994. == Biography == Furnas obtained his AB in Psychology in 1974 from Harvard University, and his PhD in Psychology in 1980 from Stanford University.CURRICULUM VITAE George W. Furnas, at furnas.people.si.umich.edu. Accessed 14-04-2015. Furnas started his academic career as graduate student teaching assistant at Stanford University in 1975. After his graduation in 1980 he started at Bell Labs, where he was a distinguished member of technical staff for 15 years. In the last two years he was Director of Computer Graphics and Interactive Media research. In 1995 he moved to the University of Michigan, where he was appointed Professor of Psychology, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, and Professor at the School of Information. From 2002 to 2008 he was also Associate Dean for Academic Strategy, School of Information. Furnas was elected into the CHI Academy, an honorary group of individuals who have made substantial contributions to the field of human- computer interaction, in 2004 for his work in the field. In 2011 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. == Work == During his time at Bell Labs he earned the moniker \"Fisheye Furnas\" while working with fisheye visualizations. A pioneer of latent semantic analysis, Furnas is also considered a pioneer in the concept of MoRAS (Mosaic of Responsive Adaptive Systems). The body of Furnas' research, and its primacy in the field, is aptly pr\u00e9cised by the delineation of his work in his SIGCHI bio: > A principal focus of his research is in advanced information access and > visualization. His early role in the analysis of the \"Vocabulary > Disagreement\" problem lead to his co-invention of Latent Semantic Analysis > for indexing and text processing. His classic \"Generalized Fisheye Views\" > paper inspired a sea of focus+context research in information > visualization.George Furnas at www.sigchi.org/about/awards/awards-2004. And furthermore > George's BITPICT graphical rewrite system is well known novel contribution > to diagrammatic reasoning, visual languages and visual programming > communities. George was also an early researcher in the areas of > collaborative filtering,and graph visualization. His \"Space-Scale Diagrams > in the Pad++ Zooming User Interface\" advanced the analysis of zoomable user > interfaces, and View Navigation theory has helped motivate much subsequent > research in Information Scent. Recently he has been working on consolidating > theories of design and use at multiple levels of aggregation. == Selected publications == * Furnas, George W.
