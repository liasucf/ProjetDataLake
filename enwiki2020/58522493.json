    "text": "Ang\u00e8le Jos\u00e9phine Aim\u00e9e Van Laeken (, ; born 3 December 1995), better known by her stage name Ang\u00e8le, is a Belgian singer-songwriter and musician. She was one of 2018's biggest breakout acts in French and Belgian pop, breaking Stromae's record for weeks at the top of the Belgian singles charts with her 2018 single \"Tout oublier\" which features her brother Rom\u00e9o Elvis. == Biography == Ang\u00e8le Van Laeken is the daughter of the singer Marka and of the actress Laurence Bibot. Her brother is the rapper Rom\u00e9o Elvis. She was born in Uccle. Her father encouraged her from an early age to learn the piano, which inspired her musical career. Ang\u00e8le spent a difficult adolescence in a strict Catholic school before attending the Decroly School. The artistic options at this high school helped develop her musical skills. She then enrolled in the Jazz Studio Antwerp for a jazz education before joining her father's band. == Musical career == Ang\u00e8le gave her first performances in caf\u00e9s around Brussels. Notably at the restaurant Le Delecta, in Ixelles, now closed. She was first noticed for her cover of Dick Annegarn, \"Bruxelles\", and on Instagram videos where she mixed singing and comedy. In 2017, she was the support act for Ibeyi and the Belgian rapper Damso, whom she also accompanied in his album Lithop\u00e9dion. Her first single, \"La Loi de Murphy\", was released in late 2017 and received millions of views on YouTube. A second single \"Je veux tes yeux\" was released in early 2018. The two video clips were directed by the Belgian photographer Charlotte Abramow. In May 2018, she performed her first Parisian concert at the Trianon accompanied by MC Solaar on her cover of his song \"Victime de la mode.\" She performed in several summer festivals in Belgium, France and Switzerland such as Les Ardentes, Dour, Garorock and Rock Werchter. In 2018, Ang\u00e8le released her third single, \"La Thune\". In August 2018, she announced the tracklist of her first album Brol on the Initial label. The album was released on 5 October 2018, the same day as her single duet with her brother, Rom\u00e9o Elvis. This album was successful and resulted in Ang\u00e8le invitation to perform on various French TV shows. The single, \"Tout oublier\", spent nine weeks at number 1 on the Ultratop charts, breaking the record for a Belgian artist formerly set by Stromae. In 2019, Angele became one of the most sought for artists in France and Belgium and affirmed her feminism with the song \"Balance ton quoi\" in reference to the French #metoo movement, Balance ton porc. Pierre Niney makes an appearance in the video alongside some of Angele's friends to talk about struggles her female friends have encountered with men. The song is not about ridiculing men but about educating everyone to live in a more accepting society. In April 2020, Ang\u00e8le performed for One World: Together At Home-A global broadcast & digital special to support front line healthcare workers and the WHO during the Covid-19 pandemic, hosted by Lady Gaga. == Musical influences == Ang\u00e8le is a fan of Ella Fitzgerald and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne S\u00e9gara. She is inspired by many musical genres from French songs to electronic music and rap, which she disliked as a teenager. She became influenced by rap particularly while performing with her brother Romeo Elvis and the rappers Caballero and JeanJass. ==Tours== Headlining * Brol Tour (2018\u20132020) with already 14 dates announced for 2020 including the AccorHotels Arena in Paris and the Palais 12 in Brussels in front of 15.000 people Opening act * Damso \u2013 Ips\u00e9it\u00e9 Tour (2017) == Discography == === Studio album === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:10px;\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:220px;\"|Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:220px;\"|Album details ! style=\"text- align:center; width:20px;\" colspan=4|Peak positions ! rowspan=\"2\" |Sales ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:220px;\"|Certifications |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | BEL (Wa) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | BEL (Fl) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | FRA *Brol: ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | SWI |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018 |Brol | * Released: 5 October 2018 * Label: Ang\u00e8le VL Records * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 | * FRA: 751,036 | * BEA: 4\u00d7 Platinum * SNEP: Diamond |} Other releases *Brol la suite (2019) (Peak:SNEP #191) Lescharts.com: Brol la suite page === Singles === ==== As lead artist ==== ==== As featured artist ==== === Other charted songs === == Awards and nominations == ===Red Bull Elektropedia Awards 2018=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" |- ! width=5%|Year ! style=\"width:35%;\"| Award ! style=\"width:40%;\"| Nomination ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Result |- | rowspan=\"5\" | 2018 | Artist of the year | rowspan=\"3\"|Herself | | |- | Best Song | | |- |- | Breakthrough Artist/ Producer | | |- | Best Video | \"La loi de Murphy\" & \"Je veux tes yeux\" | | |} ===D6bels Music Awards=== The D6bels Music Awards is a musical event organized by RTBF, a public radio and television service of the French Community of Belgium. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" |- ! width=5%|Year ! style=\"width:30%;\"| Award ! style=\"width:30%;\"| Nomination ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Reference |- | rowspan=\"10\" | 2018 | Album of the year | \"Brol\" | | |- | Female solo artist | rowspan=\"5\"|Herself | | |- | Chanson fran\u00e7aise | | |- | Concert | | |- | Musician | | |- | Author/composer | | |- | Videoclip | \"La thune\" | | |- | Hit | \"La loi de Murphy\" | | |} ===Music Industry Awards=== The MIA's, in full Music Industry Awards, are Flemish music prizes that are awarded by the VRT in collaboration with Music Centre Flanders. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" |- ! width=5%|Year ! style=\"width:30%;\"| Award ! style=\"width:30%;\"| Nomination ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Reference |- | rowspan=\"7\" | 2018 | Album | rowspan=\"2\" | \"Brol\" | | |- | Artwork | | |- | Author/composer | rowspan=\"4\" |Herself | | |- | Breakthrough | | |- | Female solo | | |- | Pop | | |- | Videoclip | \"La loi de Murphy\" | | |- | rowspan=\"5\" | 2019 | Song of the year | rowspan=\"1\" | \"Tout oublier\" | | |- | Female solo | rowspan=\"3\" |Herself | | |- | Pop | | |- | Live Act | | |- | Videoclip | rowspan=\"1\" | \"Balance ton quoi\" | | |- |} ===Victoires de la Musique=== Victoires de la Musique is an annual French award ceremony where the Victoire accolade is delivered by the French Ministry of Culture to recognize outstanding achievement in the music industry that recognizes the best musical artists of the year.
