    "text": "The Economists\u2019 Statement on Carbon Dividends is a joint statement signed by over 3,500 U.S. economists promoting a carbon dividends framework for U.S. climate policy. The statement was originally published on January 16, 2019 in The Wall Street Journal with signatures from 45 Nobel Prize winning economists, former chairs of the Federal Reserve, former chairs of the CEA, and former secretaries of the Treasury Department. Since its original publication, the statement has been signed by over 3,500 U.S. economists and has been recognized as the largest statement in the history of the economics profession. == Summary == The statement recognizes an immediate need for climate action and offers five policy recommendations: # A carbon tax is the most cost-effective method of reducing carbon emissions at the necessary scale and speed. # The carbon tax should be revenue neutral and designed to increase every year until emissions reductions goals are met. # A sufficiently robust carbon tax can replace carbon regulations that are less efficient. # A border carbon adjustment system will prevent carbon leakage and enhance the competitiveness of American firms that are more energy-efficient that their foreign competitors. # The carbon tax's revenue should be distributed to U.S. citizens in equal lump-sum payments. == Reception == The statement was praised for the spectrum of economic thought and political opinion represented by its signatories. Former Harvard University President and U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called the statement\u2019s proposal \u201cone of the few ideas of economic policy that commands broad, bipartisan support.\u201d The Chicago Booth Review noted that it was \u201cperhaps the closest that the economics profession has ever come to a consensus.\u201d Former chair of the Federal Reserve and the CEA Janet Yellen praised the statement for its broader political implications, saying it \u201crepresents a major tipping point in U.S. climate policy.\u201d == Original Signatories == The original 45 signers of the statement were: # George Akerlof # Robert Aumann # Martin Baily # Ben Bernanke # Michael Boskin # Angus Deaton # Peter Diamond # Robert Engle # Eugene Fama # Martin Feldstein # Jason Furman # Austan Goolsbee # Alan Greenspan # Lars Hansen # Oliver Hart # Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m # Glenn Hubbard # Daniel Kahneman # Alan Krueger # Finn Kydland # Edward Lazear # Robert Lucas # N.
