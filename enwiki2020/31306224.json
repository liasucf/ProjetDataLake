They become fast friends and Allan is invited to Steve's studio apartment on Montreal main to meet his commune/drug network. Allan decides he wants to do a paper with the controversial position that drug use has positive effects using Steve's 'family' as a case study. Life with Steve and the gang isn't quite as rosy as it might appear to Allan at first but it isn't quite as sleazy as it might appear to others either. Pierre (Pierre Robert), a bisexual, heroin addict/male prostitute with a wife and small daughter looks to displace Steve as the leader of the group when, compelled by his addiction he concocts a plan to steal drugs from a storage locker at the train station. Steve, having nearly followed through on the same plan, is certain it is a trap. Being indiscreetly watched and recorded by corrupt narcotics cops the tension rises. ==Cast== *Stephen Lack as Steve *Pierre Robert as Pierre *Peter Brawley as Peter *Allan Moyle as Bozo *Pam Holmes as Pam ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 films Category:Films directed by Allan Moyle Category:Canadian drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian LGBT- related films Category:1977 LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:1977 drama films Category:1977 directorial debut films ",
