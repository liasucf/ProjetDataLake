In 2003 Talley became the 20th member on the Wall of Fame in Ralph Wilson Stadium. ===Later career=== Talley left the Bills to play with the Falcons in the 1995 campaign and then with the Vikings. He left Atlanta on a less than stellar note when it was discovered that he played his last game in Atlanta with a loaded U-Haul truck in the parking lot. He had it so he could go home to spend the holiday with his family once the game was over. He ended his career after the 1996 season and won the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Distinguished Service Award in 2000. ==Personal life== On June 2, 2008 Talley commented that former Bills kicker Scott Norwood should be inducted onto the Bills' Wall of Fame. He stated; > \"One thing I wish people would take a look at is out of all the things that > we accomplished we wouldn't have done a lot of them without Scott Norwood\". > He continued on, \"Everybody seems to have forgotten Scott. If you look back > in the early days we won a lot of games with special teams and him kicking > field goals. So I think there's somewhere up there (the Wall) for Scott to > be, but nobody wants to acknowledge him because he missed a kick. But as I > recall, I missed some tackles in that game, Bruce missed some. Thurman > dropped some balls and Jim threw interceptions, but nobody realizes that > here is a guy that made major contributions to what this organization was > about. It just irks me that people have forgotten him.\" He now lives in Dallas, Texas with his wife and two kids.
