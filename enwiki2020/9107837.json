In February 1954, however, the wing began building up again in preparation for an overseas movement, but was inactivated instead. ===Flying training=== From the implementation of the Objective Wing organization until 1997, the group served as the flying arm of the 64th Flying Training Wing. ===Expeditionary operations=== The 64 AEG/AEW operated out of Camp Snoopy at Doha International Airport, Qatar from 1996 until 2004. In 2005, the group was activated for defense of personnel and assets in Southwest Asia.

The group was made up of about 300 security forces, support airmen, and civilians in two squadrons: the 64th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron and the 64th Expeditionary Support Squadron. Their mission was to stand guard, provide integrated defense, emergency response, and combat support for the base, which houses military and host-nation tenant agencies.
