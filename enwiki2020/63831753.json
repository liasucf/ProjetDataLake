    "text": "Einar Snorrason (died 1538), called Einar \u00d6lduhryggjarsk\u00e1ld (the Old Ridge Poet), was a 16th-century Icelandic priest and poet whose family played a significant role in the Icelandic Reformation. Although definitive records do not exist, Einar is believed to be the son of a farmer, Snorra Sveinssonar, and born in Miklaholtshrepur in northwest Iceland. It is recorded that in 1497 Einar was ordained as a priest and settled at Sta\u00f0 \u00e1 \u00d6lduhrygg. He became a well known enough poet for J\u00f3n Arason to refer to him the best poet in the west of Iceland, however none of his work remains. Einar's companion was Gu\u00f0r\u00fan Oddsd\u00f3ttir, the niece of , the Bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt. Their sons were and Brandur Einarsson, known as Gleraugna-P\u00e9tur and Moldar-Brandur respectively; both became sheriffs. He also had at least two children with Ingir\u00ed\u00f0i J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttur, a sister of Bishop Stef\u00e1n J\u00f3nsson. Their son, Marteinn Einarsson, became the second Lutheran bishop of Iceland, while their daughter, Gu\u00f0r\u00fan, married wealthy landowner Da\u00f0i Gu\u00f0mundsson. Einar's sons and son-in-law all clashed with Catholic Bishop J\u00f3n Arason during the Icelandic Reformation, culminating with Da\u00f0i capturing J\u00f3n and his sons at the Battle of Sau\u00f0afell. ==References== Category:Icelandic poets Category:16th-century Icelandic people Category:16th-century Icelandic poets Category:1538 deaths ",
