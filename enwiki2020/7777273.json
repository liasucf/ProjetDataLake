    "text": "Princess Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt (20 June 1754 \u2013 21 June 1832) was a Hereditary Princess of Baden by marriage to Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden. She was the daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Henriette Karoline of Palatine-Zweibr\u00fccken. == Life == Amalie was born in Prenzlau and was brought to St Petersburg with her mother in 1772 to visit the Russian court as one of the candidates for a marriage with the Tsarevich Paul Petrovich; Paul, however, decided upon her sister Wilhelmine. ===Hereditary Princess of Baden=== Amalie married her first cousin, Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden on 15 July 1775. He was the son of Margrave Charles Frederick (who in 1806, after his father's death, became the 1st Grand Duke of Baden) and Karoline Luise of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Ludwig VIII of Hesse-Darmstadt. During her marriage, Amalie complained about her father-in- law's coldness and the childish behaviour of her husband. Amalie also missed the Prussian and Russian courts. She served ceremoniously as the first lady of the court from the death of her mother-in-law in 1783 until the marriage of her son in 1806. In 1801, she visited her daughter Louise (Empress Elizabeth) in Russia with her family, and thereafter her second daughter, the Swedish Queen Friederike, in Sweden in September 1801. During Amalie's stay in Sweden, she was described as witty, intelligent and correct, and fully dominated her spouse.

Shortly before her departure, she was inducted in the Yellow Rose lodge of Karl Adolf Boheman, (search for all versions on WorldCat) by him referred to as a branch of the Freemasons. ===Later years=== During her visits in Russia and Sweden she made attempts to reconcile her sons-in-law, the Russian and Swedish monarchs with each other. (search for all versions on WorldCat) In 1803, she received the royal Swedish family as guests in Baden, during which it was said that she had the chance to gain influence over her son-in-law, as she was lovable and amusing, had a lively interest in politics and the same views as him. (search for all versions on WorldCat) It was said of Amalie that: \"The Landgravine of Baden could in power hunger and will force measure up to that of Catherine II\". (search for all versions on WorldCat) As an opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte, she had tried to prevent the wedding of her son to St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais, and after their wedding in 1806, she retired to her widow estate at Schloss Bruchsal in the Kraichgau. In 1807, Amalie sent her daughter, Queen Frederica of Sweden, a letter from her second daughter, the Empress of Russia, in an attempt to convince Frederica to use her influence to persuade her spouse to make peace between Sweden and Napoleon, which did not succeed.

In 1811, she tried to persuade Gustav Adolf not to divorce Frederica, but when it proved necessary, she arranged for her daughter's economic independence and the custody of her grandchildren. (search for all versions on WorldCat) In 1815, her grandson Gustav of Sweden was referred to as \"Prince of Sweden\" in an announcement from the Baden court, which caused protests from Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who believed it to have been instigated by Amalie, as she had a reputation for plotting, in an attempt to secure a throne for her grandson. (search for all versions on WorldCat) During the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Amalie's influence upon her son-in-law Tsar Alexander I contributed to the fact that Baden was allowed to remain a Grand Duchy without loss of territory. She died in Bruchsal, aged 78, having outlived her husband and six of their eight children. ==Issue== * Princess Katharine Amalie Christiane Luise (13 July 1776 \u2013 26 October 1823) * Princess Friederike Caroline Wilhelmine (13 July 1776 \u2013 13 November 1841), married on 9 March 1797 the then Duke Maximilian of Zweibr\u00fccken as his second wife (and became grandmother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria).
