    "text": "Ero is a genus of pirate spiders first described in 1836. They resemble comb- footed spiders due to their globular abdomen, which is higher than it is long. == Description == The upper side of their abdomen bears one or two pairs of conical tubercles and some curved bristle-like hairs. The anterior medial eyes project on small tubercles. Leg 1 is nearly twice as long as leg 4. Their egg sacs are uniquely shaped elongated globes, about four millimetres in diameter. They are suspended from vegetation on a silken thread, and are made from an inner layer of yellowish brown silk and an outer layer of dark coloured, loosely woven silk, giving it a \"woolly\" appearance. The sacs are not guarded by the female and when the juveniles hatch, so they have to fend for themselves. Since Ero species are nocturnal, the adults are not often seen and the egg sacks often reveal their presence before specimens are found. ==Feeding behaviour== Spiders in this genus are specialised spider killers. They attack potential victims by biting one of its legs and injecting toxins. It quickly retreats as the prey spider becomes paralysed. When its prey is immobile, it feeds by sucking out the victim's body fluids. ==Species== The World Spider Catalog lists these species: * Ero aphana (Walckenaer, 1802) \u2014 Palearctic (St. Helena, Queensland, Western Australia, introduced) * Ero cachinnans Brignoli, 1978 \u2014 Bhutan * Ero cambridgei Kulczy\u0144ski, 1911 \u2014 Palearctic * Ero canala Wang, 1990 \u2014 China * Ero canionis Chamberlin & Ivie, 1935 \u2014 USA * Ero capensis Simon, 1895 \u2014 South Africa * Ero catharinae Keyserling, 1886 \u2014 Brazil * Ero comorensis Emerit, 1996 \u2014 Comoro Islands, Seychelles * Ero eburnea Thaler, 2004 \u2014 Ivory Coast * Ero felix Thaler & van Harten, 2004 \u2014 Yemen * Ero flammeola Simon, 1881 \u2014 Portugal to Corfu, Canary Islands * Ero furcata (Villers, 1789) \u2014 Palearctic * Ero furuncula Simon, 1909 \u2014 Vietnam * Ero galea Wang, 1990 \u2014 China * Ero ganglia Yin & Bao, 2012 \u2014 China * Ero gemelosi Baert & Maelfait, 1984 \u2014 Galapagos Islands * Ero goeldii Keyserling, 1891 \u2014 Brazil * Ero gracilis Keyserling, 1891 \u2014 Brazil * Ero humilithorax Keyserling, 1886 \u2014 Brazil * Ero japonica B\u00f6senberg & Strand, 1906 \u2014 Russia, China, Korea, Japan * Ero jiafui Yin & Bao, 2012 \u2014 China * Ero juhuaensis Xu, Wang & Wang, 1987 \u2014 China * Ero kompirensis Strand, 1918 \u2014 Japan * Ero laeta Barrientos, 2017 \u2014 Portugal, Spain * Ero lata Keyserling, 1891 \u2014 Brazil * Ero lawrencei Unzicker, 1966 \u2014 South Africa * Ero leonina (Hentz, 1850) \u2014 USA * Ero lodingi Archer, 1941 \u2014 USA * Ero lokobeana Emerit, 1996 \u2014 Madagascar * Ero madagascariensis Emerit, 1996 \u2014 Madagascar * Ero melanostoma Mello-Leit\u00e3o, 1929 \u2014 Brazil * Ero pensacolae Ivie & Barrows, 1935 \u2014 USA * Ero quadrituberculata Kulczynski, 1905 \u2014 Madeira * Ero salittana Barrion & Litsinger, 1995 \u2014 Philippines * Ero spinifrons Mello-Leit\u00e3o, 1929 \u2014 Brazil * Ero spinipes (Nicolet, 1849) \u2014 Chile, Argentina * Ero tenebrosa Lissner, 2018 \u2014 Canary Islands * Ero tuberculata (De Geer, 1778) \u2014 Palearctic * Ero valida Keyserling, 1891 \u2014 Brazil ==References== ==External links== Category:Mimetidae Category:Araneomorphae genera Category:Cosmopolitan spiders ",
