The role of the department is to consult as well as to create and execute projects and to operate as a project organization where the physical location of workers is not relevant when carrying out the operations. The operations of Research and Development department are especially targeted to certain areas of focus. These areas of focus include The Nordic Countries and the neighboring North Calotte Area, as well as the familiar collaboration area of European Union countries, but on a wider scale than previously. Resources are also aimed at cooperation with Russia and particularly with the Barents region. The central field of operation of Research and Development department is the EU -project work. The basis for acquiring and implementing projects is engaging them as an integral part of the applied research of the UAS. The project leaders and other needed workers are recruited mainly from the personnel of the UAS, in which case the project experiences can be directly utilized in education. This way the project working contributes also teachers\u2019 acquisition of qualifications and further education. By means of the projects, opportunities will be provided for the students to complete theses and carry out practical training periods. A substantial element of the project work is the international collaboration realized with the local commercial and industry life. The objectives of this form of activity are to develop both regional enterprises and public sector, to enhance employment and create connections to international companies and other partners in cooperation by utilizing the possibilities information society provides. ===Strategic fields of expertise=== In Industrial Lapland KTUAS develops know-how in * maintenance, * product development and * enterprise resource management (ERP).

Local companies as customers are really interested in the outcomes of student\u2019s studies. Smaller development projects at the beginning of the studies lead into more challenging LIIKE tasks during practical training and thesis work. For deserving participants this creates better opportunities for employment after graduation. ==eLearning Centre== The eLearning Centre of Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences was created in the year 2000 concurrent with the Finnish policy towards the creation of the foremost information and knowledge society in Europe. Although administratively the centre is a support unit of the University of Applied Sciences, it serves all organizations associated with the Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Education and Training Consortium Lappia. The eLearning Centre\u2019s main tasks have concerned the adoption and administration of online learning environments (presently Moodle and iLinc) and both pedagogical and technical instruction and support for students and staff endeavouring to learn and teach in these environments.
