He had nine children with his second wife. ==Military career== Wepener participated in some Frontier Wars (1834\u20131853) as Acting Field Cornet. He moved to the farm De Nek in Aliwal North in 1850 where he took part in the Eighth Frontier War (1850\u20131853) (Xhosa wars) and was promoted to Commandant due to his outstanding leadership.
