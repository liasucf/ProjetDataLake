    "text": "Babu Singh Kushwaha (Born 7 May 1966) is an Indian politician in Uttar Pradesh. He was one of Mayawati's most trusted \"backroom boys\", and a senior member of the UP cabinet. On 7 April 2011, he was forced to resign after being implicated in the murder of two chief medical officers, BP Singh and VK Arya. Both were shot dead by two assassins on motorcycles, in central Lucknow, in broad daylight. The same gun had been used in both cases. It was alleged that their honesty was coming in the way of a political mafia who were skimming off large sums from the health services. ==Political career== Kushwaha has worked for the Bahujan Samaj Party. He was for years perceived as the closest to Mayawati. He was a member of Legislative Council, and cabinet minister twice. Kushwaha was the second most powerful person in the Bahujan Samaj Party. All changed after the successive murders of two medical officers in Lucknow blew the lid off the giant National Rural Health Mission scam. He had held the portfolio of Family Welfare and mining Department before resigning. Kushwaha joined BJP in presence of senior leaders Vinay Katiyar and Surya Pratap Shahi, but his induction resulted in voices of dissent in the party, after which he wrote a letter to the BJP national president Nitin Gadkari requesting him to suspend his membership until proven innocent.Kushwaha formed the political party \"Jan Adhikar Party\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:Bahujan Samaj Party politicians from Uttar Pradesh Category:Members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council Category:State cabinet ministers of Uttar Pradesh Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Uttar Pradesh Category:1966 births ==Further reading == * ",
