During his career, he also worked as a professor of the Moscow Conservatory, and became a Doctor of Arts. His work was recognized by the awards of the title of People's Artist of the USSR and two Stalin Prizes. ==History== Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov, known as Sasha, was born on 13 April 1883 in Plakhino, a village in Ryazan Governorate south-east of Moscow. As a boy, his singing was so impressive that he traveled to Saint Petersburg to become a chorister at Kazan Cathedral. A pupil of Medtner, he studied composition at Saint Petersburg and in Moscow, where he eventually became professor of music in 1918 and choirmaster at Christ the Saviour from 1918 to 1922. Alexandrov founded the Alexandrov Ensemble, and spent many years as its director, in which role he first gained favor with Joseph Stalin, the country's ruler during the last two decades of Alexandrov's life. His choir participated successfully in the Universal Exposition of 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, Stalin commissioned him and lyricist Sergey Mikhalkov to create a new Soviet national anthem, which was officially adopted on 1 January 1944 and was used by the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. It later became the National Anthem of Russia in December 2000, with Mikhalkov writing the new lyrics. He also composed the famous song \"The Sacred War\", and the official march of the Soviet and now Russian Armed Forces, the Song of the Soviet Army. His works include a number of settings of various Russian folk songs (e.g., \"Utushka lugovaya\"). He died on 8 July 1946, while on tour in Berlin; some records say he was returning from Germany.The exact place of his death is still in dispute and apparently controversial. ==See also== *Alexandrov Ensemble *Alexandrov Ensemble choir *Alexandrov Ensemble soloists *Alexandrov Ensemble discography *Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov ==References== ==External links== * Geraldika biography of A.V.
