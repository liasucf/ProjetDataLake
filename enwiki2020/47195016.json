    "text": "The third round of CAF matches for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification was played from 7 October 2016 to 14 November 2017. ==Format== A total of 20 teams which had advanced from the second round were drawn into five groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches. The winners of each group qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Seeding== The draw for the third round was held on 24 June 2016, 17:00 EET (UTC+2), at the CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt. The seedings \u2013 initially released on 8 June 2016 \u2013 were based on a special edition of the FIFA World Rankings that included all matches up to 7 June 2016. This allowed the rankings to include results of the Africa Cup of Nations qualification games played between 3\u20135 June 2016. However, following a complaint by the Egyptian Football Association, it was reported that a further special ranking would be used. This seeding was released on 21 June. Following further complaints, the Emergency Bureau for the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers reversed the change, and restored the initial special rankings. *Pot 1 contained the teams ranked 1\u20135. *Pot 2 contained the teams ranked 6\u201310. *Pot 3 contained the teams ranked 11\u201315. *Pot 4 contained the teams ranked 16\u201320. Each group contained one team from each of the four pots. The fixtures of each group were decided based on the respective draw position of each team, which was decided by drawing a ball with position numbers 1\u20134. Note: Bolded teams qualified for the World Cup. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=25%|Pot 1 !width=25%|Pot 2 !width=25%|Pot 3 !width=25%|Pot 4 |- | | | | |} ==Groups== ===Group A=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group C=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group D=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group E=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Goalscorers== There were 144 goals scored in 61 matches, for an average of goals per match. ;5 goals * Mohamed Salah ;4 goals * Pr\u00e9juce Nakoulma * Khalid Bouta\u00efb ;3 goals * Richmond Boakye * Thomas Partey * Victor Moses * Youssef Msakni * Brian Mwila ;2 goals * Yacine Brahimi * Banou Diawara * Alain Traor\u00e9 * Vincent Aboubakar * Nuno Rocha * Garry Rodrigues * C\u00e9dric Bakambu * Jonathan Bolingi * Neeskens Kebano * Dieumerci Mbokani * Firmin Ndombe Mubele * Abdallah El Said * Naby Ke\u00efta * Seydou Doumbia * Hakim Ziyech * Kelechi Iheanacho * Alex Iwobi * John Obi Mikel * Cheikh N'Doye * Diafra Sakho * Percy Tau * Collins Mbesuma * Patson Daka ;1 goal * Nabil Bentaleb * El Arabi Hillel Soudani * Issoufou Dayo * Bertrand Traor\u00e9 * Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa * Benjamin Moukandjo * Clinton N'Jie * Franck Pangop * Banana Yaya * Marvin Baudry * Thievy Bifouma * Arnold Bouka Moutou * F\u00e9r\u00e9bory Dor\u00e9 * Vladis- Emmerson Illoy-Ayyet * Yannick Bolasie * Chancel Mbemba * Paul-Jos\u00e9 M'Poku * Shikabala * Mario Lemina * Axel M\u00e9y\u00e9 * Edwin Gyasi * Alkhaly Bangoura * Demba Camara * Keita Karamokoba * Seydouba Soumah * Maxwel Cornet * Gervinho * Max Gradel * Jonathan Kodjia * Hamdou Elhouni * Ali Elmusrati * Motasem Sabbou * Akram Zuway * Sambou Yatabar\u00e9 * Youn\u00e8s Belhanda * Medhi Benatia * Nabil Dirar * Achraf Hakimi * Mimoun Mahi * Odion Ighalo * John Ogu * Moses Simon * Keita Bald\u00e9 Diao * Sadio Man\u00e9 * Kara Mbodji * Opa Nguette * Isma\u00efla Sarr * Moussa Sow * Dean Furman * Thulani Hlatshwayo * Andile Jali * Tokelo Rantie * Thulani Serero * Sibusiso Vilakazi * Themba Zwane * Aymen Abdennour * Anice Badri * Mohamed Ben Amor * \u00c4nis Ben-Hatira * Ghailene Chaalali * Wahbi Khazri * Yassine Meriah * Milton Karisa * Farouk Miya * Emmanuel Okwi * Enock Mwepu ;1 own goal * Wilfred Moke () * Ousmane Sidib\u00e9 () * Salif Coulibaly () * Thamsanqa Mkhize () ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * **Qualifiers \u2013 Africa: Round 3, FIFA.com *2018 FIFA World Cup Russia \u2013 Qualifiers, CAFonline.com 3 Qual Category:Tunisia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Category:Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Category:Morocco at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Category:Senegal at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Category:Egypt at the 2018 FIFA World Cup ",
