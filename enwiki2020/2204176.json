    "text": "Genexus is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Fear Factory, released on August 7, 2015. It is the third Fear Factory album since guitarist Dino Cazares rejoined the band in 2009, their first album to feature drummer Mike Heller, and the final album they released with vocalist Burton C. Bell before his departure from the band in 2020. However, Bell's vocals for the band's upcoming album will remain intact, as he recorded them in 2017. Genexus is also Fear Factory's first release through Nuclear Blast. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from critics. A lyric video for the song \"Soul Hacker\" was released on June 17. A lyric video for the song \"Protomech\" was released on July 11. A full music video for the song \"Dielectric\" was released on August 7, the same day as the album release, and a music video for \"Expiration Date\" was released on April 12, 2016. ==Sound and production== Regarding the drums on Genexus, Burton C. Bell stated: \"...This time we are gonna use a live drummer, we're gonna use Mike Heller to record a few of the songs, not all of them, but a few to get that live feel, because some of these songs require a live feel, and so we\u2019re gonna go with that.\" Like its predecessor The Industrialist and the (at the time) 20 year old Demanufacture, Genexus is a concept album. The themes in the album include war, climate change, religion, and mortality. == Reception == Genexus received a very positive response by critics, praising the album for its extremely brutal and abrasive sound. Ray Van Horn, Jr. of BlabberMouth said that \"the key and industrial supplements gives Genexus a busier and heartier personality, lighting up the album's prospectus of mankind transitioning toward a more mechanized state of being.\" Trey Spencer of Sputnik Music surmised that \"this album is more melodic and accessible, Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell prove that they still have what it takes to make a visceral Fear Factory album.\" James Christopher Monger of Allmusic commented that \"more melody-driven than prior outings, Genexus nevertheless retains the band's penchant for pairing bleak science fiction imagery with piston-like, palm- muted guitar riffs and explosive percussion.\" == Touring == Between the end of August and the middle of September in 2015, the ensemble had toured the Southern, Midwestern and Southwestern United States along with Once Human, Los Angeles metal band Before the Mourning and Chicago rock/metal band The Bloodline. == Track listing == == Personnel == * Burton C.
