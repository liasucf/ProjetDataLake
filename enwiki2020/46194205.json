    "text": "Pine Crest Inn is a historic resort inn complex located in Tryon, Polk County, North Carolina. The inn and three of the ten cottages were built in 1906 as the Thermal Belt Sanatorium for tuberculosis care. The 2 1/2-story inn and 1 1/2-story cottages are Classical Revival style frame buildings that feature pedimented gables and attached one-story shed porches supported by Tuscan order columns. The remaining cottages were built after the conversion of the property to an inn in 1917. Four of the cottages were built by Pine Crest Inn developer Carter Brown, and two are historic log cabins moved to the property from the eastern Tennessee mountains. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1997, the inn added a 2-story conference center with three conference rooms, and now attracts numerous corporate, governmental, and private meetings, retreats, and events. ==References== ==External links== *Pine Crest Inn website Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Neoclassical architecture in North Carolina Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1906 Category:Buildings and structures in Polk County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Polk County, North Carolina Category:1906 establishments in North Carolina ",
