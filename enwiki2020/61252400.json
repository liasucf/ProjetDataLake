He was often used as a substitute goalkeeper and was loaned out to Hong Kong football club Sun Hei where he had a successful period with them going on to establish himself as their first choice goalkeeper as they went on to win the 2011\u201312 Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield cup with the club. Within the match he would personally win the MVP award as Sun Hei won 5-3 on penalties against South China. On his return to Guangdong, Hou was unable to go on to establish himself at his parent club and he joined third tier side Meizhou Hakka along with his teammate and fellow goalkeeper Li Weijun. At Meizhou, Hou was used as the substitute goalkeeper behind Li Weijun as the club went on to win the 2015 China League Two division and promotion into the second tier. Li Weijun would retire at the end of the 2016 season and Hou was promoted to the clubs first choice goalkeeper where he quickly established himself as an integral member of the team as well as eventually becoming their captain. ==Career statistics== ===Club statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=7|Guangdong Sunray Cave |2007 |China League Two |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2008 |China League Two |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2009 |China League One |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2010 |China League One |9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||9||0 |- |2011 |China League One |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2012 |China League One |3||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4||0 |- ! colspan=2 | Total !12!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!13!!0 |- |Sun Hei (loan) |2011\u201312 |Hong Kong First Division |13||0||1||0||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||19||0 |- |rowspan=8|Meizhou Hakka |2013 |China League Two |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2014 |China League Two |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2015 |China League Two |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2016 |China League One |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0 |- |2017 |China League One |28||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||28||0 |- |2018 |China League One |30||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||30||0 |- |2019 |China League One |30||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||30||0 |- ! colspan=2 | Total !88!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!88!!0 |- ! colspan=3 | Career total !113!!0!!2!!0!!5!!0!!0!!0!!120!!0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Sun Hei *Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield: 2011\u201312 Meizhou Hakka *China League Two: 2015 ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Chinese expatriate footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Hong Kong Premier League players Category:China League Two players Category:China League One players Category:Sun Hei SC players Category:Meizhou Hakka F.C. players Category:Chinese expatriate sportspeople in Hong Kong Category:Expatriate footballers in Hong Kong ",
