He returned to the newspaper Le Monde in 1974 as correspondent in Bangkok from where he covered the Vietnam War. His criticisms of the Phnom Penh and Saigon regimes resulted in repeated bans on his stay in the Khmer republic and in the Republic of Vietnam. His work allowed him, however, in 1973, to win the Albert Londres Prize. The following year, he was transferred to Nairobi where, for the same daily, he would cover East Africa until 1979, when he joined the Africa department at the headquarters of the newspaper in Paris. In 1985, he became deputy head of the foreign service in charge of Asia, before returning to Bangkok in 1991, again as correspondent. == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * == References == == External links == * Jean-Claude Pomonti 23 articles on Slate * Le journaliste Jean-Claude Pomonti d\u00e9voile Hanoi et ses mutations on Le Petit Journal * J-Claude Pomonti on La revue des ressources * Jean-Claude Pomonti se replonge dans le Vietnam on the site of Prix Albert Londres * Jean-Claude Pomonti on Le Monde Diplomatique Category:20th-century French journalists Category:21st-century French journalists Category:Albert Londres Prize recipients Category:1940 births Category:Living people ",
