    "text": "The New Adventures of Batman is an animated series that aired on CBS from February 12 to May 28, 1977, featuring the DC Comics superheroes Batman and Robin, and Batgirl. The series was a Filmation and DC Comics production in association with Warner Bros. Television (whose current parent company is WarnerMedia). ==Plot== In The New Adventures of Batman, the \"Dynamic Duo\" fights crime in Gotham City, encountering the classic Batman rogues gallery as well as some original villains. Complicating matters is Bat-Mite, a well- meaning imp from another dimension called Ergo, who considers himself Batman's biggest fan. As a result, he wears a variant of Batman\u2019s costume and attempts to help him, only to often create more problems. Missing is Alfred, the faithful butler of Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne; also notable in this series are the inverted colors of the circled \"R\" on Robin's costume. ==Voice cast== * Adam West as Batman / Bruce Wayne * Burt Ward as Robin / Dick Grayson * Melendy Britt as Batgirl / Barbara Gordon, Catwoman / Selina Kyle * Lou Scheimer as Bat-Mite, Batcomputer, Clayface / Matt Hagen (1st and 2nd Times), Lucky's Henchman (in \"The Chameleon\") * Lennie Weinrib as Commissioner Gordon, Joker, Penguin / Oswald Cobblepot, Mr. Freeze / Victor Fries (in \"The Deep Freeze\"), Electro (in \"Bite-Sized\"), Chameleon (in \"The Chameleon\"), Dr. Devious (in \"The Chameleon\"), Zarbor, Clayface (3rd Time), Moonman / Scott Rogers (in \"The Moonman\"), Professor Bubbles (in \"The Bermuda Rectangle\"), Flow (in \"The Bermuda Rectangle\"), Lucky Luger (in \"The Chameleon\"), Professor Frost (in \"The Deep Freeze\"), Boyd Baxter (in \"Curses! Oiled Again!\") ==Production== ===Development=== In September 1968, before The New Adventures of Batman Filmation Associates had created and aired an animated Batman series (pre-Bat-Mite), named The Batman/Superman Hour, for CBS. This series, the first Saturday Morning vehicle for the Caped Crusader, paired up new Batman and Robin adventures with old Superman/Superboy episodes. In 1969, it was repackaged into 30-minute episodes without the Man of Steel and renamed Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder. The New Adventures of Batman was produced concurrently with Super Friends, which was produced by the competing Hanna- Barbera Productions and included Batman and Robin as members, marking a rare occurrence in animation history which saw two studios simultaneously producing series featuring the same characters. The main distinction was that in Filmation\u2019s series, Batman and Robin were voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward, the lead actors of the 1960s Batman series. Hanna-Barbera's Batman and Robin were voiced by Olan Soule and Casey Kasem, who also voiced the Dynamic Duo for Filmation's 1968 version, The Batman/Superman Hour. ===Airdates=== The New Adventures of Batman originally premiered February 12, 1977 on CBS. The episodes from this series were later aired along with other Filmation shows\u2014such as Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (1976, CBS) \u2014as part of: The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (1977\u20131978 CBS), Tarzan and the Super 7 (1978\u20131980 CBS), and Batman and the Super 7 (1980\u20131981 NBC). ===Missing villains=== The Riddler and the Scarecrow were off-limits to the show, as Hanna-Barbera already had the rights to the characters for Challenge of the Super Friends (though the Riddler does appear in the opening credits of the show in a pink-colored costume, and was mentioned being arrested at the beginning of the episode \"The Deep Freeze\"). This is also the reason why the Joker could not appear in Challenge of the Super Friends, though he was planned as a Legion of Doom member.http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super- friendsdarrell.html ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin: auto; ! | No. ! | Title ! | Villain(s) |- |} ==Home video== The New Adventures of Batman was released on DVD format on June 26, 2007 by Warner Home Video (via DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment); all 16 episodes are collected, and are presented in its original, uncut broadcast presentation and original airdate order. A retrospective detailing the creation of the series titled \"Dark Vs. Light: Filmation and The Batman\" featuring Filmation historian Michael Swanigan and Filmation founder Lou Scheimer is included as well. One episode (the first one, titled \"The Pest\") was released, along with an episode of Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, in the Saturday Morning Cartoons: The 1970s Vol. 1 DVD, also released by Warner Home Video. ==Legacy== Homage was paid to The New Adventures of Batman in a 1998 episode of Bruce Timm's The New Batman Adventures. In the DVD release audio commentary for the 1998-1999 season, Timm and the rest of the series creators (writer Paul Dini, director Dan Riba, artist Glen Murakami, and storyboarder James Tucker) explain that the first segment of the October 10, 1998, episode \"Legends of the Dark Knight\" purposely makes use of the same designs The New Adventures of Batman used for the Joker, Batman and Robin, as well as the same color schemes and shading in a nod to both The New Adventures of Batman and to Batman artist Dick Sprang, whose style heavily influenced the visuals of the Filmation cartoon (along with Neal Adams). They further explain that the episode segment also purposely makes use of the trademark silliness and corny tone of the original series (which differs from the darker, serious tone of Timm's series) and also mimics the low frame rate animation style used by Filmation. ==References== ==External links== * The New Adventures of Batman at Big Cartoon DataBase * * * Filmation animated series * AOL Television: In2TV: The New Adventures of Batman * Japanese opening to New Adventures of Batman * TVshowsondvd.com: DVD Release * Batman: Yesterday, Today and Beyond - The Batman Homepage - The New Adventures of Batman Category:1977 American television series debuts Category:1977 American television series endings Category:1970s American animated television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:Batman (TV series) Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Batman television series by Filmation Category:NBC original programming Category:American sequel television series Category:Animated television shows based on DC Comics Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
