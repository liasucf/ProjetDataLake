He's the ultimate prankster and trouble-maker. But one day, he goes too far in causing a commotion. He strikes a statue of Atlas with a stick, causing the globe Atlas was holding to roll into the gymnasium, where a basketball game is taking place. No one is injured, but the gym is completely demolished and destroyed. The district superintendent, Dr. Schultz, is watching the game. He catches Donovan red-handed. However, when he jots down Donovan's name, he accidentally writes it on the list of candidates for the Academy for Scholastic Distinction (ASD), a school for extremely gifted students. Donovan knows he will be busted and feels that he will cause more stress to his already stressed out household. His older sister, Katie, is currently staying with them and is seven months pregnant. Katie's husband, Brad, is deployed in Afghanistan with the Marines. Adding to the pressure, Katie's mother-in-law drops off Brad's dog, who seems to be ill and only takes a liking to Donovan. But after learning he is getting sent to ASD it is filled with joy by the mistake. On his first day, Donovan meets his classmates and while some seem to be annoyed by him, some take a liking to him, especially Chloe, a girl interested in normal things. While Donovan continues to hide out in the Academy, his teachers begin to question if he is gifted. Donovan also joins Robotics, a class taught by his homeroom teacher Mr. Osborne (Mr. Oz) Donovan helps give their robot a name: Tin Man Metallica SquarePants gets his classmate Noah (an extremely intelligent and serious boy) hooked to YouTube and shows his classmates the talent he has of controlling the robot with a joystick.
