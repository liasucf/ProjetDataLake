East of the interchange, the route travels as Lamontville Road through rural wooded areas running parallel to the Hiwassee River, until it reaches SR 58 in Meigs County. About east of I-75 the highway enters Calhoun and comes to an intersection and runs concurrently with US 11 (SR 2, Lee Highway) for about . They go south near a paper mill operated by Resolute Forest Products, formerly Bowater, before entering a business district, where SR 163 splits off and goes through downtown as Bowater Road.
