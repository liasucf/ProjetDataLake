    "text": "The Proton X70 is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Malaysian car maker Proton. Marketed as a C-segment SUV, the car was launched in 12 December 2018, unveiled in a ceremony by then-prime minister and former Proton chairman Mahathir Mohamad. Being the first SUV released by Proton, it is conceived by rebadging the Geely Boyue, following the acquisition of Proton by Geely Automobile Holdings in 2017. The X70 is distinguishable from the Boyue by some design element differences and its right-hand drive configuration. In the beginning, the X70 was fully imported (CBU or completely built-up) from China, but since February 2020 the locally assembled version (CKD or complete knocked down) was made available with several notable mechanical changes. == History == === Pre-launch === In 24 May 2017, DRB-HICOM as the owner of Proton has reached an agreement with Geely for the Chinese carmaker to acquire a 49.9% equity stake in Proton. The acquisition and partnership was urgently needed, since at the time DRB-HICOM cites several problems which were Proton\u2019s lack of technological competitiveness, which it claimed could hamper its ability to develop quality products. Through the close partnership, Proton will have access to Geely\u2019s technologies to address the problem. In the same day, DRB- HICOM announced a plan to build a crossover SUV for Proton based on the Geely Boyue. The Boyue was picked as the first new product under the Geely ownership to compete in the booming SUV market, which Proton had no presence in. Being the first Geely-based product, the X70 does not share any components with any other Proton vehicle. Proton claimed that pricing the X70 competitively was a great challenge as it lacked parts commonality with other models, and yield smaller scale production relative to its left-hand drive Chinese counterpart. In April 2018, Proton opened up an online poll to the public to vote on the name. Participants could choose between PX7, X7, X70 and X700 or voice in their own input. X70 was later announced as the chosen name for the SUV in September 2018. In June 2018, it was announced that the initial units were going to be fully imported (CBU) from China with latter models being locally assembled (CKD) at Proton's plant. The X70 was previewed at the 2018 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show. === Post-launch === The X70 was officially launched in 12 December 2018 at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. In the launch ceremony, then-prime minister Mahathir Mohamad presents the first X70 key to his wife Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali during the launch, a tribute to the original Proton Saga launch as the first Proton vehicle. The X70 is available with four variants. Prior to the CKD version these were Standard 2WD, Executive 2WD, Executive AWD and Premium 2WD. All variants are powered by the same 1.8-litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection (TGDI) engine with the Geely Boyue, producing and paired to a 6-speed automatic gearbox. Local assembly of the X70 in Proton's Tanjung Malim plant commenced on 13 December 2019. In February 2020, the locally assembled (CKD) version was launched with lowered pricing and a few major mechanical updates. The gearbox is now a 7-speed wet DCT, and the same 1.8-litre TGDI engine has its torque increased by (to ). It is still available in four variants, however the top two variants had received a major revision. The Executive AWD trim has been discontinued due to low demand and in its place the Premium 2WD. The CKD Premium 2WD trim however excludes the panoramic sunroof previously included in the CBU version. The panoramic sunroof is instead reserved for the top-of-the-line Premium X 2WD; the only additional feature for this variant. Although identical in styling to the CBU, the CKD version is distinguishable by its use of Proton's new round logo. With the introduction of the CKD units, the CBU units were no longer being imported from China. In August 2019, Proton introduced a special version of the car called the Proton X70 Merdeka Edition of which only 62 are available for sale to celebrate Malaysia's 62nd independence day on 31 August 2019. Only 2 colours were offered; Flame Red (26 units) or Snow White (36 units). == Development == Compared to the Boyue, Proton said it had to reposition and realign several critical parts which include the dashboard assembly, pedals, steering console, door buttons, brakes, gearbox, headlights calibration, wiper orientation, air-conditioning ducts, glove box, and several cables and wires in order to convert it into a right-hand drive vehicle, as the Boyue was not developed to have an RHD version in mind. A total of 761 parts had to be changed to convert the Boyue into the right-hand drive X70, without counting the components that were completely re-engineered. The localization process also involved several adjustments of the car to suit the tropical climate. Some rubber components and cooling parts had to be redesigned, while the engine management system had to be recalibrated to account for the rougher terrain and altitude. The X70 must be able to withstand Kuala Lumpur\u2019s standstill traffic at 34\u00b0C daily, drive up to the mountainous Genting Highlands at over 6,000 feet where the air is thinner, as well as survive the treacherous landscape of East Malaysia. After all the changes, the X70 had to undergo a testing process that involved repeating around 25 percent of the 548 tests that was conducted in the development of the donor car, the Boyue. Proton managed to reach 45 percent of local content for the X70 by the time production in Tanjung Malim began in late 2019. It was achieved by sourcing components from local suppliers, which some of them did not initially have the capability to produce several advanced components. Proton and Geely offered a solution by initiating a series of and technical assistance and joint ventures agreements with Geely suppliers in China. The company aims to increase the local component figure to around 53 percent by the end of 2020. A total of 95 Proton engineers were said to be involved in the entire process of turning the Boyue into the X70, from research and development to the testing stages. These engineers, along with technicians from manufacturing and quality divisions, made up around a total 200 people the company sent to Geely within a span of six months to conceive the X70. Each of these individuals were claimed by the group has learned knowledge and experience from their counterparts at Geely, further enhancing Proton engineering expertise. == Design == Rear view There are a few design elements incorporated into the X70 to distinguish it from the Boyue, especially at the front of the SUV. A new grille design is used and it is referred to as the \"infinite weave\". It is inspired by the batik and Malaysian wood carvings, and the design is also used on the inside for the speaker covers. A chrome surround is added on the grille and is inspired by a hunting bow, one of Malaya's traditional weapons. To further showcase Proton's identity and evoke the appearance of a tiger, the muscular body surfacing of the X70 is also accompanied by a headlight design inspired by the eyes of a tiger. == Interior == Interior A tonneau cover, air purifier system, rear air vents, automatic dual zone air conditioning, steering wheel switches, tilt and telescopic adjustment, LCD meter combination, central door locking with auto lock and push start button are all standard interior related features. Across the range, the Proton 'GKUI' head-unit is offered which consists of 8\" touchscreen display, voice recognition, online music streaming, navigation, smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity and 4G Wi-Fi. Speaker count is 6 on the Standard 2WD variant, 8 on the Executive 2WD and 9 on the Premium 2WD and Premium X 2WD variant with the additional subwoofer. Note that the Premium 2WD variants gets additional voice recognition functionality. The GKUI Android- based infotainment system is based on the similar system found in the Boyue with adjustments to operate properly in Malaysia. == Safety == === ASEAN NCAP === Proton X70 had received a full score in ASEAN NCAP crash safety rating for the side impact test as well as for head protection technology. All versions are equipped with ABS, EBD, brake assist, ESC, traction control, six airbags, ISOFIX child seat mounting points, and seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"3\" |ASEAN NCAP 2018 Proton X70: |- !Vehicle Category ! colspan=\"2\" |SUV |- !Number Of Airbag ! colspan=\"2\" |6 |- ! !Score !Rating |- !Overall !89.24/100.00 ! |- !Adult Occupant Protection !35.27/36.00 ! |- |Frontal impact |15.27/16.00 | rowspan=\"3\" | |- |Side impact |16.00/16.00 |- |Head protection technology |4.00/4.00 |- !Child Occupant Protection !40.78/49.00 ! |- |Frontal impact |14.00/16.00 | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Side impact |8.00/8.00 |- !Safety Assist !14.00/18.00 ! |- |Effective Braking & Avoidance |8.00/8.00 | rowspan=\"4\" | |- |Seatbelt Reminders |3.00/6.00 |- |Blind Spot Technology |1.00/2.00 |- |Advanced SATs |2.00/2.00 |} == Reception == === Malaysia === The X70 has received generally favourable reviews from critics in its domestic market. Malaysian automotive journalist Jonathan Lee from paultan.org commended the X70's looks, infotainment, suspension and NVH attributes. The overall package offered were exceptionally praised, in which Lee claimed was \"beyond anything else in the segment \u2013 with or without the pricing advantage\". However Lee also criticised on the high driving position, shallow boot and lack of more common features found in the segment such as a powered tailgate. HP from evomalaysia.com commended the X70's premium feeling interior but commented that steering feel could be improved and both turbo lag and body roll is quite noticeable. With the locally assembled model, Hafriz Shah from paultan.org criticized the X70's lack of differences in the exterior when compared to the CBU variant and the new Proton logo as \"out of place\". Shah however commended on the improvements compared to the CBU model which includes the DCT transmission and added equipment. Kon from evomalaysia.com shared a similar conclusion saying the improvement bundled with the reduced price makes the X70 ever harder to avoid. Kon however did criticse the X70 as \"not quite as sporty as Proton vehicles from the 2000s\" == Awards and accolades == * Connectivity & Infotainment - Carlist.my Editors' Choice Awards 2018 *Vehicle Design of the Year - DSF.my Allianz Vehicle of the Year (VOTY) 2019 * Best 3 Mid-sized SUVs - 2019 'Cars of Malaysia' * Local Car of the Year - CarSifu Editors\u2019 Choice Awards 2019 * Best Large-size SUV/Crossover (2-row seating) - CarSifu Editors\u2019 Choice Awards 2019 == Export markets == === Brunei === In July 2019, PAD Motors, the official distributor of Proton cars in Brunei, has announced that Brunei will become the first export destination for the Proton X70, which is a right hand drive version of the Geely Boyue.
