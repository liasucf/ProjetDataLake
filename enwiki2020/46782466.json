    "text": "The Pittsburg Diamonds are an independent professional baseball team based in Pittsburg, California. Originally named the Pittsburg Mettle, the club changed their name to the Diamonds in 2015. == History == The Pittsburg Mettle began play as a member of the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs in 2014. The club rebranded after Khurram Shah, a local businessman, took over for the 2015 season during which the team made news signing former Oakland Athletics slugger Jose Canseco for two separate weekend stints. Pittsburg is managed by former Major League Baseball professional Aaron Miles, who was a part of the 2006 World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. In 2016 the Diamonds again signed Canseco, this time to a month-long contract to finish the regular season. Canseco would collect two RBI in 14 plate appearances in addition to making three starts as a pitcher. The club announced before the 2019 season that it would take a one-year hiatus with plans to return in 2020. ==Current roster== == Season-by-season == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Wins !Loses !Result !Playoffs |- |2014 |22 |56 |4th of 4 |Did not qualify |- |2015 |38 |39 |3rd of 4 |Did not qualify |- |2016 |36 |42 |3rd of 4 |Did not qualify |- |2017 |36 |42 |2nd of 4 |Did not qualify |- |2018 |36 |44 |4th of 6 |Lost semifinal game vs Sonoma Stompers |} ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs teams Category:Professional baseball teams in California Category:Pittsburg, California ",
