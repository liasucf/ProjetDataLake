    "text": "Keeled earless lizard (Holbrookia propinqua) female, municipality of Soto La Marina, Tamaulipas, Mexico (20 May 2002). Holbrookia is a genus of earless lizards, known commonly as the lesser earless lizards, in the family Phrynosomatidae. The genus contains six recognized species, which are found throughout the Southwestern and Central United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by having no external ear openings, presumably to prevent soil from entering their bodies when they are digging. ==Etymology== The generic name, Holbrookia, is in honor of American zoologist John Edwards Holbrook.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America \u2013 Explained. Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Holbrookia, p. 125). ==Description== Lesser earless lizards grow to about 2.0-2.5 in (50\u201365 mm) snout-to-vent length, plus a tail of 3-4 in (75\u2013100 mm). They are typically grey or tan in color, with black blotching. The males usually have blue patches on either side of their bellies, whereas the females do not. Females often change to have bright orange patches when gravid. ==Behavior== Holbrookia species are diurnal, basking lizards. They spend the vast majority of their time sunning on rocks, even in the heat of the day, until the surface temperature reaches around 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C), when they will retreat to a rock crevice or burrow. ==Diet== Lesser earless lizards are insectivorous. ==Species== The genus Holbrookia contains six species recognized as valid:.\"Holbrookia \".

They are also found in Mexico, in the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. ==See also== *Genus Cophosaurus, the greater earless lizard ==References== ==External links== * *Colorado Herpetological Society: Lesser earless lizard ==Further reading== *Girard C (1851). \"On a New American Saurian Reptile\".
