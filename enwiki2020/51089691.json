He had a passion for drawing and, at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed at a local decorative painting workshop.\"Vicente Castell y su Tiempo\" @ Jaume I University. His talents eventually gained him entrance to classes being taught by the costumbrista painter and drawing professor, Eduardo Laforet (1850-1941), who had a home and workshop in Castell\u00f3n where he served as a mentor to young artists.

During the war, with very little demand for art, he and a friend opened a small workshop where they made toys. After pricking the middle finger on his right hand with a large splinter, he developed an infection that required surgery and left that finger virtually paralyzed.

In 1928, he was one of the founders of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios and was chosen to be Director. He suffered hearts attacks in 1932 and 1933 and died of one in 1934.
