    "text": "Ivan Matveyevich Tolstoy (; ) was a Russian Count, diplomat, senator, grand master of court ceremonies, and minister of postal service. == Biography == Count I. M. Tolstoy worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs until 1860. For a brief interval, he served as Chief Steward of the Imperial Household and was grand master of court ceremonies. In 1863, he became Feodor Pryanishnikov's immediate successor as Head of the Postal Department. In 1865, he was appointed to the first Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. An attempt to merge the postal and telegraph services was not successful. Only in 1884, during the reign of Alexander III, were the two services amalgamated. This resulted in the depiction of thunderbolts and post horns on Russian postage stamps. Tolstoy died in 1867. He was replaced by General (1818\u20131893) as the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. == See also == * Feodor Pryanishnikov * Postage stamps and postal history of Russia * Samuel Polyakov * Tolstoy (family) == References == Category:1806 births Category:1867 deaths Ivan Matveyevich Category:Imperial Russian counts Category:Government ministers of Russia Category:Imperial Russian diplomats Category:Senators of the Russian Empire Category:Russian postmasters ",
