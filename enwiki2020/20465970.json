He played for Sheffield United, Manchester United and Northampton Town, winning the FA Cup with Sheffield United in 1925. He later spent a season as player-manager of Scarborough. ==Playing career== Born in Sheffield, Boyle was spotted playing for the Bullcroft Colliery team and signed for Sheffield United in 1921. He initially found it difficult to establish himself in the first team, but over time his form improved, particularly his heading, which was a factor in him being selected for the 1925 FA Cup Final ahead of the more experienced Tommy Sampy. He left the Blades in 1929 after making over 140 appearances and scoring 40 goals. Boyle signed for Manchester United for \u00a32,000, but failed to settle and spent only one relatively unproductive season at Old Trafford in which he made just 17 starts. He was registered as a player by Macclesfield Town in May 1930 but by July of the same year had left for Northampton Town where he spent a successful five seasons, starting over 140 games for the Cobblers.

After leaving Scarborough, Boyle became the licensee of the Plough Inn in nearby Scalby, North Yorkshire. ==Honours== ;Sheffield United *FA Cup: 1924\u201325 ==References== ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com Category:1901 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Footballers from Sheffield Category:English footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Bullcroft Main Colliery F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Scarborough F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Scarborough F.C. managers Category:People from the Borough of Scarborough Category:English people of Irish descent ",
