    "text": "Sir Jonathan Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet, PC (23 September 1783 \u2013 28 August 1870) was a British lawyer and Tory politician. ==Background and education== Pollock was the son of saddler David Pollock, of Charing Cross, London, and the elder brother of Field Marshal Sir George Pollock, 1st Baronet. The Pollock family were a branch of that family of Balgray, Dumfriesshire; David Pollock's father was a burgess of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and his grandfather a yeoman of Durham. His business as a saddler was given the official custom of the royal family. Sir John Pollock, 4th Baronet, great-great-grandson of David Pollock, stated in Time's Chariot (1950) that David was, 'perhaps without knowing it', Pollock of Balgray, the senior line of the family (Pollock of Pollock or Pollock of that ilk) having died out.Time's Chariot, John Pollock, Murray, 1950, p. 267 Pollock was educated at St Paul's School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was Senior Wrangler at Cambridge University. He is also thought to be one of the founding members of the Cambridge Union Society, along with Henry Bickersteth and Sir Edward Hall Alderson, both of Gonville and Caius College. ==Political, legal and mathematical careers== Pollock was Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon from 1831 to 1844. He served as Attorney General between 1834 and 1835 and 1841 and 1844 in the Tory administrations of Sir Robert Peel. In 1841 he was admitted to the Privy Council and appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, a post he held until 1868. Having been knighted on 29 December 1834, Pollock was created a Baronet, of Hatton in the County of Middlesex, on 2 August 1866. Apart from his political and legal career Pollock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816. He contributed a number of papers in mathematics to the Royal Society, including one on what is now known as the Pollock's conjecture. ==Family== Pollock died in August 1870, aged 86, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, William. His fourth son, Charles Edward Pollock, apprenticed to his father, had no university education. He became a law reporter then co-serving Baron of the Court of Exchequer, becoming the last in that appeal court. Two of Pollock's grandsons became prominent lawyers: Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet (d.1937), was Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Oxford; Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth (d.1936), served as Master of the Rolls. ==References== ==External links== * * * * *Descendants of Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Bt. * * Category:1783 births Category:1870 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Attorneys General for England and Wales Category:Chief Barons of the Exchequer Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1831\u20131832 Category:UK MPs 1832\u20131835 Category:UK MPs 1835\u20131837 Category:UK MPs 1837\u20131841 Category:UK MPs 1841\u20131847 Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Senior Wranglers Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ",
