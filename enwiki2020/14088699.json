    "text": "Danish Dance Theatre Danish Dance Theatre is the largest modern dance company in Denmark. The company was founded in 1981 by Randi Patterson, an English/Norwegian choreographer and innovator of modern dance. Patterson was succeeded by American Warren Spears, Dane Anette Abildgaard and British Tim Rushton. Swedish choreographer and filmmaker Pontus Lidberg is artistic director from April 2018. Danish Dance Company is based in Copenhagen. == History == Since 2001, Tim Rushton (MBE) has been the company's Artistic Director and has successfully continued Danish Dance Theatre's vision of combining the classical arts with the modern. Today, Danish Dance Theatre is the foremost contemporary dance company in Denmark, as well as the largest. The company is composed of hand-picked dancers from all over the world. Especially during the early years, stories and literary sources have often been a central role in the inspiration and creation of the company's performances. The company often collaborates with well-known writers, visual artists and composers and the music often ranges from classical masterpieces to jazz, rock and new compositions. Danish Dance Theatre receives an annual operating subsidy from the Ministry of Culture. Since the company's funding represents approximately half the financial support that other comparable Nordic companies receive, it is necessary to have additional financial backing from private companies, foundations and endowments. Until 2005, Danish Dance Theatre was a touring company with no permanent stage. In 2005, the company moved to Folketeatret in Copenhagen, where they had both a permanent stage and dance studio. In November 2009, the company moved from Folketeatret to DANSEhallerne and together with Dansescenen and Dansens Hus they are now situated on the former site of the Carlsberg Brewery. Between national touring, international touring and stationary performances, the company conducts between 60-80 performances annually. Danish Dance Theatre was founded in 1981 by the English/Norwegian choreographer and pioneer Randi Patterson, in collaboration with Anette Abildgaard, Ingrid Buchholtz, Mikala Barnekow and soon after, Warren Spears. At that time, the company was named \u2018New Danish Dance Theatre.\u2019 The repertoire spans from large stage productions at the Royal Danish Theatre, Danish Dance Theatre also does an extensive amount of both national and international touring. Besides touring and several stationary performances in Copenhagen, the company is also famous for two annual open-air events: \u201cCopenhagen Summer Dance\u201d, which takes place in the Copenhagen Police Headquarters and runs for one week in August and the picnic-performances \u201cSpring Dance at Carlsberg\u201d, which takes place during the two first weekends of June. The company's Artistic Director Tim Rushton has been nominated ten times for Best Dance Performance of the Year at the Danish Theatre Awards, Reumert, receiving the award four times; in 1999 for Busy Being Blue, in 2005 for Chalk, in 2006 for Requiem and in 2009 for Labyrinth. In 2010, Danish Dance Theatre received the Reumert Award for Frost, choreographed by Tina Tarpgaard. Since Rushton came to Danish Dance Theatre in 2001, the company has quadrupled the number of audience members. In addition, Rushton has received many other awards. In 2006 he received the Teaterkatten (Theatrecat) award as best director, a title awarded by \u201cThe Association of Danish Theatre Journalists\u201d. In 2007 he received the \u201cNational Arts Foundation Award\u201d for exceptional works of art for the 2006 performance Requiem. In 2008 he received \u201cThe Danish Arts Society\u201d award and in 2009 \u201cThe Wilhelm Hansen Foundation\u201d award. In 2011 he was honoured with the British MBE \u2013 Member of the Order of the British Empire \u2013 for his outstanding work for modern dance. In 2012 Tim Rushton received an Honorary Award at the Danish Theatre Awards, Reumert - this award is given an artist who through the years has made a unique contribution to the positive development of the performing arts in Denmark - and who is still actively performing. == Awards == Won the Danish Reumert Award for Best Danceperformance in: * 1999 Busy Being Blue * 2005 Kridt (Chalk) * 2006 Requiem * 2009 Labyrint Nominated for the Reumert Award for Best Danceperformance in: * 1998 Udflugt i det bl\u00e5 * 2000 Dominium * 2006 Silent Steps * 2006 Animal Park * 2008 Passion * 2012 Love Songs == Important productions == * 2012 ** MONOLITH: Danish Dance Theatre, at the Royal Theatre, May 10, 2012.
