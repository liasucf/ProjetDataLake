The station is owned by Dominion Media, an arm of the Clarksville-based Celebration Harvest Church, which also owns independent station WWJS-CD (channel 45). WJYL-CD maintains offices located on Eastern Boulevard (just west of I-65) in Clarksville, and its transmitter located in rural northeastern Floyd County (northeast of Floyds Knobs, Indiana). ==History== The station was founded in 1986 as W05BA, originally broadcasting on VHF channel 5. The calls were modified to W05BE in 1987; in 2002, it received a lettered callsign as WVHF-LP and moved to UHF channel 45. The station obtained Class A license status in 2004, becoming WVHF-CA. In 2008, its calls were changed to WNDA-CA, before switching again to WJYL-CA in 2009 (what is now WWJS-CD formerly used the WJYL-CA call letters from 2002 to 2009, and the WNDA-CA calls from 2009 to 2010). The station flash-cut its digital signal into operation on UHF channel 16 in February 2009. The station changed its call sign to WWWJ-CD on August 10, 2017, and back to WJYL-CD on September 27, 2017. At one time, WJYL-CD operated a translator, W65CX, broadcasting near Elizabethtown, Kentucky.http://oldtvguides.com/all_thumbs/65-w65cx%20%20%20(wjys- lp-26)%20%20%20elizabethtown,%20ky%20%20%20320%20mi%20%20%2013%20kw.html As W05BE, the station was featured in the April 1994 edition of Popular Communications magazine, in a feature about low-power broadcasting.
