The aim is to reduce travel time between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg: before Allegro, the journey time was 5\u00bd hours; currently it is 3 hours and 27 minutes and there are plans to bring it down to 3 hours. The name Allegro is a musical term for a quick tempo, thereby suggesting \"high speed\". ==Route== Allegro connects the following stations:Timetables - VR * St. Petersburg (Finlyandsky station) * Vyborg * Vainikkala * Kouvola * Lahti * Tikkurila * Pasila * Helsinki The trains also stopped previously in Pasila like every other passenger train from and to Helsinki, but this stop was discontinued on 27 March 2016 until on 29 March 2020, the stopped in Pasila was revived.https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/en/train-timetables-finland-russia#Allegro Vainikkala (on the Finnish side of the border) and Vyborg are special stations: on trains bound for Finland, passengers are not allowed to leave the train at Vyborg, as the train only stops to pick up passengers; and on trains bound for Russia, passengers are not allowed to leave the train at Vainikkala, for the same reason.

Sm6 stands for electric multiple unit (, literally 'electric motor train') model 6. The Sm6 appears similar to VR's earlier Sm3 Pendolino series, but is based on the fourth generation 'Pendolino Nuovo' or 'New Pendolino' designs and its construction differs from the Sm3 in many ways. The top speed of the train in passenger traffic is and the train can run at a speed of at least between Tikkurila and Luum\u00e4ki and Vyborg and St. Petersburg after extensive rail works. The aim is to reduce travel time between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg from 5\u00bd hours to 3 hours. The travel time was 3:27. The Sm6 is equipped to operate on both the Finnish and the Russian railway networks. The units have dual-voltage electrical equipment able to use both the Finnish 25 kV 50 Hz alternating current and the Russian 3 kV direct current electrification. The wheelsets are built to run at over speeds on both the Finnish and the nominally slightly narrower Russian gauge, and the doors are equipped with a retractable step to make boarding from both Finnish high and Russian high platforms easy. The units are equipped for both the Finnish and Russian railway technical systems, which differ substantially.
