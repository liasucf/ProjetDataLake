After moving to Nashville, Gretzinger partnered with Provident Label Group to release her third studio album. Forever Amen was announced by Gretzinger on Instagram the night before the album's release, saying: ==Critical reception== Timothy Yap of Hallels gave a positive review of the album, describing it as being \"on the quieter side rifled with lots of slower and contemplative moments. Yet, what's the drawing power of the record is not in the tempo of the songs. Rather, it's the way these songs have a way of drawing us together before the feet of Jesus.\" ==Commercial performance== In the United States, Forever Amen launched at No. 2 and No. 24 on the Billboard Christian Albums and Top Album Sales chart dated April 11, 2020. In the United Kingdom, the album launched at No. 4 on the Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart dated April 9, 2020, published by the Official Charts Company. ==Track listing== * Songwriting credits adapted from PraiseCharts. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Christian & Gospel Albums (OCC) | 4 |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Ref. |- | Various | March 27, 2020 | | Provident Label Group | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 albums Category:Steffany Gretzinger albums ",
