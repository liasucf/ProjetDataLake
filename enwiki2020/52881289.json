Its centrepiece is the world's tallest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex, which is surrounded by a terraced forest setting. Jewel includes gardens, attractions, a hotel, about 300 retail and dining outlets, and convenient early baggage check-in aviation facilities. It covers a total gross floor area of 135,700 m2, spanning 10 storeys \u2013 five above-ground and five basement levels. Its attractions include the Shiseido Forest Valley, an indoor garden spanning five storeys, and the Canopy Park at the topmost level, featuring gardens and leisure facilities. Jewel receives about 300,000 visitations a day. In October 2019, six months after its soft opening, it had welcomed 50 million visitors, exceeding its initial target for whole year. The complex and airport is located in Changi, at the eastern end of Singapore, approximately northeast from Singapore's Downtown Core. ==Conception== Jewel was conceived to maintain Changi Airport's status as a major aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific. It was first mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech in 2013 as part of Changi Airport's long-term plans to double its capacity by the mid-2020s and \"create more opportunities for Singapore and Singaporeans\". Built over the former open-air car park in front of Changi Airport Terminal 1, Jewel expanded Terminal 1's arrival hall and baggage claim areas by 70%, and its handling capacity is also expected to increase from 21 to 24 million passengers a year. Jewel was officially opened on 18 October 2019 by Lee Hsien Loong, six months after its soft opening. During this time, it had received 50 million visitors \u2013 about 300,000 visitors a day \u2013 exceeding its initial target of 40-50 million visitors for the first year. Jewel was developed by Jewel Changi Airport Trustee Pte Ltd, a joint venture between Changi Airport Group (CAG) and CapitaLand, through its wholly owned shopping mall business, CapitaLand Mall Asia. The project cost S$1.7 billion, and did not involve any government funds or taxpayers\u2019 money. ==Design and development== Jewel's toroidal glass-and- steel fa\u00e7ade was designed by a consortium of architects, led by Moshe Safdie, who also designed Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. Renowned local firm RSP Architects Planners & Engineers were the executive architect and structural engineers. The landscape architect was Peter Walker and Partners, who co- designed the National 9/11 Memorial and worked with Safdie on the landscaping of Marina Bay Sands. Benoy were the interior designers; BuroHappold Engineering were responsible for the fa\u00e7ade and Lighting Planners Associates handled the lighting.Jewel Changi Airport 6 May 2019 The Rain Vortex was engineered by water design firm WET Design. It has a 360-degree light and sound show projected onto it.World's tallest indoor waterfall inside Safdie Architects' Singapore airport building Dezeen, 12 March 2019 Jewel was envisioned to combine a marketplace and an urban park. \"The component of the traditional mall is combined with the experience of nature, culture, education and recreation, aiming to provide an uplifting experience. By drawing both visitors and local residents alike, we aim to create a place where the people of Singapore interact with the people of the world,\" said Safdie. The glass panels of the dome are framed in steel which rests on a complex latticework. At night, the glowing beautiful dome would be visible from all surrounding areas. ==Attractions== ===Shiseido Forest Valley=== A collaboration of Shiseido and art collective teamLab from Japan, the is one of Asia's largest indoor gardens, spanning five stories and approximately 22,000 square meters located in the heart of Jewel Changi Airport. It houses around 3,000 trees and 60,000 shrubs of 120 species that live in high-altitude tropical forests from around the world. ===The Rain Vortex=== The Rain Vortex The Rain Vortex, sponsored as the HSBC Rain Vortex, it is the world's largest and tallest indoor waterfall, standing at high. Recirculating rain water is pumped to the roof to free fall through a round hole at up to per minute to a basement-level pool. An acrylic funnel at the bottom prevents splashing and insulates the sound of the cascade. The toroid-shaped roof has more than 9,000 pieces of glass spanning 200 by 150 meters with a sloped oculus as the mouth of the waterfall acting as \"a continuation of the building...completed in a liquid form.\" At night, the circular walls of the waterfall becomes a 360-degree stage for a light-and-sound show. To prevent excess humidity in the Jewel, the waterfall's flow alternates between cascades and trickles that reduce air turbulence. The design process by WET Design engineers included testing an on- fifth-scale model and a full-size partial prototype. The Changi Airport Skytrain connecting the terminals passes above ground near the waterfall, allowing passengers remaining airside to see the Vortex and Jewel itself. ===Canopy Park=== At the topmost level of Jewel, the 14,000 sq m Canopy Park houses recreation and leisure attractions. About half of the total landscaping is hosted at Canopy Park, including two gardens: Topiary Walk and Petal Garden. The Topiary Walk features animal-shaped topiaries at every corner, while the Petal Garden will have seasonal floral displays. The park includes a suspension bridge called the Canopy Bridge that is located 23 metres above the ground which offers a panoramic view of the Rain Vortex. At 50 metres long, the Canopy Bridge also has a glass panel flooring at the centre section that offers a view through to level 1 of Jewel. The Canopy Park houses nine food and beverage outlets. Aloha Poke, Arteastiq Bistro, Burger & Lobster, Herit8ge, Prive, Rumours Bar & Grill, Tanuki Raw, The World is Flat, and Tiger Street Lab are all located on the fifth floor between the exit and entry to Canopy Park. Purchasing a ticket is required to enter the Canopy Park, priced at S$4.50 for Singaporeans and S$5 for non-residents, with additional costs for each of the mazes, bridge, nets, and experience studio. *Canopy Mazes The park also consists of two mazes, situated at the eastern end of the Jewel called the Hedge Maze and Mirror Maze.

The entire structure sits at an incline, 3m high on one end, and close to 7m on the other, and enables visitors to view the Forest Valley and the Rain Vortex.
