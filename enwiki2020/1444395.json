Johannes Thomae Bureus Agrivillensis (Johan Bure) (1568\u20131652) was a Swedish polymath, antiquarian, mystic, royal librarian, poet, and tutor and adviser of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. He is a well-known exponent of Gothicism. == Life and career == Bureus was born in 1568 in \u00c5kerby near Uppsala \u2013 where the largest and last of the pagan temples once was \u2013 in Sweden, as a son of a Lutheran parish priest. He was Sweden's first national archaeologist (riksantikvarie) and first head of Sweden's national library (riksbibliotekarie). He was also the first to document runes. He has been called the father of the Swedish grammar. In 1599, he designed the coats of arms of Helsinki and Uusimaa.Kari Tarkiainen: Ruotsin it\u00e4maa (\"The Eastern Land of Sweden\"), pages 47\u201349. Publisher: Svenska litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland. Helsinki, 2010. Bureus combined his runic and esoteric interests in his own runic system, which he called the \"Adalruna\". He was interested in the Rosicrucian manifestos. Contemporary mystics such as Jakob B\u00f6hme have studied his works.Lewis, Bailey Margaret, Milton and Jakob Boehme; A Study of German Mysticism in Seventeenth-Century England (1914). In 1611, Bureus published the first ever ABC book written in \u2013 and about \u2013 the Swedish language, Svenska ABC boken medh runor, using the runic alphabet and Latin script. He also wrote a genealogy of the Bure family, partly using runestones as sources. == In popular culture == * The CD-R 'Der Mitternacht L\u00f6we' by experimental band Shadowseeds is based on Bureus' life and teachings. * The 2007 Gothic Kabbalah album by Swedish metal band Therion refers Bureus as a concept. The song \"Son of the staves of time\" is an example: \"Byrger Tidesson, from the ancient time, runic ancestor, the last of your line\" * The name of the British black metal band Adalruna and the theme of their first demo 'Rediviva' is based on Bureus and his rune system. == References == == Further reading == *Thomas Karlsson: G\u00f6tisk kabbala och runisk alkemi: Johannes Bureus och den g\u00f6tiska esoterismen.
