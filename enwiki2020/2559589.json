    "text": "Lostock Hall is a suburban village within the South Ribble borough of Lancashire, England. It is located on the south side of the River Ribble, some south of Preston and north of Leyland. It is bordered on its southeastern side by the interchange for the M6, M61 and M65 motorways. At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, the central Lostock Hall area had a population of 3,948,Neighbourhood Statistics - Lostock Hall (Ward). URL accessed 17 November 2007. falling to 3,762 at the 2011 Census Lostock Hall traces its origins to James de Lostock who in 1212 built Lostock's Hall in the then rural area of Cuerden Green in the township of Walton-le-Dale. A settlement expanded outwards from Lostock's Hall, taking its name from the Hall. The former separate community of Tardy Gate is now for all intents and purposes a part of Lostock Hall - it used to be the farming community linking one part of rural Lancashire to another. ==History== ===Early history=== The estate of Lostock's Hall in the rural area of Cuerden Green was built by James de Lostock. The grounds which surrounded Lostock's Hall got renamed as Lostock Hall after the death of James, by his daughter Magote. In 1662 Andrew Dandy paid a rent of 12d to the lord of Clitheroe for his lands called Lostock, and in 1666 William Dandy paid tax upon three hearths here. He died in 1676. Andrew Dandy and William, his son, were out-burgesses at Preston guild in 1682. To this day, a small section of the River Lostock, is known by locals as \"Dandy Brook\", in honour of the Dandys. Lostock's Hall was destroyed by a fire. Some of the main brick work not affected by the fire were reused in 1764, to form structure of a new building on the original site, as part of a regeneration project by William Clayton Esq. William's son, George Clayton inherited the hall following the death of William Clayton. George went on to living in the hall for many years with his wife Dolly, until he died in 1829, at the age of 86. George's second son, William became the new inheritor of the property, until he relocated to the South of England in the late 1840s. The trend of inheriting the hall continued for many years through such owners as Robert Orrell Esq. (cotton spinner and manufacturer, Cuerden Mills) 1847-61; John Bashall Esq. (cotton manufacturer, Lostock Hall), 1861\u201371 and Robert Jackson 1871-81. ===Modern history=== The trend of inheriting the hall ceased, when the founders of the a cotton thread works, purchased the property in the early 1880s by Harry Dewhurt; who remained living there until 1918, when he relocated to Cheshire after World War I and gave the Hall and its 6 \u00bd acres of grounds, to the Preston Royal Infirmary so that it could be used as a continuation hospital. Alteration work began, and by June 1922, the Lostock Hall Continuation Hospital formally opened its doors for women and children, continuing to do so until 1982, when the Lancashire Area Health Authority ceased to exist, and forced the hospital to closed down. During the final months of the hospital's existence, a group of Trustees had established St. Catherine's Hospice (Lancashire) Limited, in the Lancashire area, and were looking for a building to serve as a hospice base for people in the Preston, Chorley, and South Ribble Boroughs. The lands and building of the Lostock Hall Continuation Hospital were purchased, as this was positioned geographically central to all three Boroughs. The building was renovated, and the first service at the Hospice started in 1984. The first Day Care service took place on 29 April 1985. ===Ward Street bombings=== Lostock Hall fell victim to bomb attacks during the Second World War. The most serious of these attacks to effect the village was when the Leyland Motors factory in Leyland came under attack by a single bomber on 27 October 1940. Although fire from army gunners drove the bomber from his target, three bombs were dropped in the vicinity. Many terraced homes were destroyed and 27 people died. After the war a dance- hall was built on the site, subsequently used industrially by the Bacup Shoe Factory. After the shoe factory's closure in 1982, Calvary Christian Fellowship bought and developed the building and established a centre of worship and community activity. ===Todd Hall=== Todd Hall Todd Hall in Todd Lane North dates from 1630 and is a Grade II* listed building. ==Governance== Lostock Hall is an unparished ward and forms part of the South Ribble borough. Following the South Ribble local council elections in May 2015 Councillors Joseph Clifford Hughes, Jacqui Mort and Renee Noreen Blow, all of the Conservative Party, were elected to represent the Lostock Hall ward. Lostock Hall forms part of the Lostock Hall & Bamber Bridge electoral division on Lancashire County Council and is represented by Jim Marsh, also of the Conservative Party. Since the general election in 2010 the area has formed part of an extended Ribble Valley constituency. The member of parliament for this constituency is Nigel Evans of the Conservative Party. Boundary changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England as part of Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies would see Lostock Hall move into a revised South Ribble seat at the next general election. The recommendations were submitted to the Government on 5 September 2018 and it\u2019s now up to Parliament to decide whether the boundary changes will be implemented. ==Geography== Lostock Hall's main road to the north, Leyland Road leads to the district of Penwortham in the north-west, and on to the City of Preston in the north, this boundary being on the junction between B5254 (Leyland Road) and Flag Lane. To the north-east is the residential district of Walton Park which leads onto the rural village of Walton-le-Dale, with this boundary being the old railway bridge on Wateringpool Lane (just after the gas works). The main road to the east, Brownedge Road, links it to Bamber Bridge, the boundary between the two is the 'Old Railway Bridge' situated on the B5257 (Brownedge Lane). The roundabout junction of B5254 (Watkin Lane) and A582 (Lostock Lane - eastbound), in the south-east, is the boundary which separates Lostock Hall and Cuerden. ==Demography== According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Lostock Hall had a population of 3,948, with 1,959 being males, and 1,989 being females.

Tardy Gate Mill on Coote Lane was built in 1908 by the Tardy Gate Manufacturing Company it was bought out and greatly expanded by Thomas Moss & Sons in 1920 and produced calico and linen until its demise in the late 1970s. The mill also owned the local cricket pitch and sponsored the cricket team. There was also a Ladies' hockey team for many years that was originally made up mainly of workers from the weaving sheds and offices. The mill and a moderately large railway repair depot are now gone, with most inhabitants commuting to work, mainly in Preston. Tardy Gate Mill was then bought by Mr & Mrs Todd, and now houses Todds Motorhomes & camping accessory shop, a snooker hall, a printing business, a car repair garage, and many other small businesses. ===Modern-day industries=== Lostock Hall in the modern era is slowly developing itself, with many small businesses, shops, public houses, take-away facilities, and restaurants, providing a variety of goods, amenities, and meeting places, for the locals and travellers alike. The public houses in Lostock Hall are The Anchor Inn, The Pleasant Retreat Inn, The Wishing Well (formerly The Tardy Gate) and The Victoria. There are also a number of social clubs that serve alcohol: Lostock Hall Conservative Club, Our Lady & St Gerrard's Catholic Club and The Royal British Legion. The Lostock Hall Labour Club, used to operate as a social club until it was demolished to provide extra parking space for the nearby caravan business. The village of Lostock Hall has rapidly gained numerous take-away and restaurants over the years; with a selection of American, Chinese, English, Indian, Italian, and Turkish cuisines. ==Culture and community== ===Memorial Band=== After the War Memorial Project, which erected a large memorial cenotaph in Lostock Hall, enough funds remained unused to launch the Lostock Hall Memorial Brass Band, though it took an additional donation of \u00a3100 for the band then known as \"Four Lane Ends Band\" to acquire instruments. During the early years, the band played for a number of local carnivals and church processions. The band started to grow in capacity, as more and more players from other local bands started to join. The band's solo euphonium, Ron Heyes, took over as conductor for the brass band in 1963, and took the band to many contests before his 1998 retirement as Musical Director, although he did take up the baton again from 2004 to 2006. Although at first the band did not show well, gradually it began to improve. Following subscription of many young players from local schools and colleges, the band qualified for the 1984 National Brass Band Finals at London's Royal Albert Hall. Out of the 16 bands that participated in the finals, the Lostock Hall Memorial Band managed to finish a respectable 7th place. This was to be followed with more final qualifications in 1995 and 2006. Several of the band players have moved onto other areas over the years, with some pursuing their musical careers by joining the HM Forces. 2008 represented a special year for the band as they celebrated their Diamond Jubilee, and also were crowned the 4th section National Champions at the Finals in Harrogate, playing Peter Yorke's \"The Shipbuilders\" under their current conductor, John Wood. The band have recently relaunched their website, www.lostockhallband.com. ===Lostock Hall Carnival=== Lostock Hall's annual carnival is held on the first Saturday in July. It consists of a parade of floats and people, which travel around a designated route, collecting money for local charities. There is a f\u00eate on the main grass field area of Lostock Hall (situated at the back of the main shops on Hope Terrace). Many locals from Lostock Hall, and surrounding towns and villages, decorate floats and themselves to a theme which is selected months in advance by the Lostock Hall Carnival Committee. After the main procession, people congregate on the nearby field, where there are a wide selection of stalls, fairground rides, and an arena which shows a variety of dance exhibitions, and a ceremony for the best- dressed float. The carnival Queen and Princess also sit in a special VIP area and watch the entertainment in the arena. ==Education== ===Schools=== There are four schools in Lostock Hall. Lostock Hall Academy, located on Todd Lane North, is the local secondary school. Lostock Hall Community Primary School is situated on Linden Drive, and covers Key Stage 1 and 2 curriculum. Our Lady And St Gerard's Roman Catholic Primary School is situated on Lourdes Avenue, and covers curriculum for Early Years Foundation Stage, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. Moor Hey School is a special school. ===Library=== During the late 1950s and early 1960s, plans were made to create a purpose built library facility in Lostock Hall. Construction took place between 1961 and 1962, and Lostock Hall Library was officially opened by Sir Harry Pilkington on 28 January 1963. The original library consisted of two buildings, which were divided by a central garden area. The central garden area later became roofed in the 1980s to provide a much larger reference library area, with the original reference area being converted into a private office area for the staff to use. A few years passed, and the building came across a few subsidence problems, which were rectified by 1999 when work began on new foundations to cure this problem. ==Transport== ===Trains=== Lostock Hall maintains a railway station. The East Lancashire Line on which the station stands is frequently used by railway companies as a bypass for the main West Coast Main Line when that is being closed for engineering works, as it links with the Settle-Carlisle Line. For this reason, excursions frequently travel through the station, attracting railway enthusiasts to the many ideal viewing places. Lostock Hall Locomotive Shed was one of the final steam sheds housing and servicing steam locomotives up to the end of the steam era in Britain in August 1968. === Buses === Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire operate several bus services through Lostock Hall, providing commuter links to nearby towns and villages, including Preston city centre. Service 111 runs from Preston to Leyland via Penwortham, Lostock Hall and Farington. Service 109 from Preston to Chorley operates through the village, connecting it with Walton Park, Leyland, Buckshaw Village and Euxton. Service 113 between Preston and Wigan links Lostock Hall with Bamber Bridge, Leyland, Croston and Standish. ==References== ==External links== *Lostock Hall Memorial Brass Band *St Catherine's Hospice *Lostock Hall Community High School & Arts College *Lostock Hall Community Primary School *Lostock Hall MPD (engine shed) *Our Lady of Lourdes and Saint Gerard Majella *Visit South Ribble *South Ribble Borough Council *Calvary Christian Fellowship Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Geography of South Ribble ",
