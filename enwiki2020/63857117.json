Furler was a key figure in North Adelaide's 1930 and 1931 premierships, including the latter as captain. Originating from the Noarlunga Football Club in the Southern Football Association, Furler played there together with his four brothers, Ray, Albert, Ross and Leslie, and was rejected by Sturt prior to joining North Adelaide. In 1947, Furler was appointed Secretary of the North Adelaide Football Club, a position he would only hold for the one season. In 2002 Furler was an inaugural inductee into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. Furler's nephew Bob Furler was also a notable footballer, winning the 1947 Tassie Medal. == References == == External links == * Category:1904 births Category:1991 deaths Category:North Adelaide Football Club players Category:North Adelaide Football Club coaches Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:South Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Place of birth missing ",
