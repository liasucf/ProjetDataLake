A crux in climbing, mountaineering and high mountain touring is the most difficult section of a route, or the place where the greatest danger exists. In sport climbing and bouldering the most challenging point is also called the crux.Kletterlexikon at Bergleben.de In describing a climbing route using a topo, cruces (or cruxes) are usually shown with a key symbol. The grade of a climbing route is based on the difficulty of the crux. That means the rest of the route can be considerably easier. In addition a route may comprise several cruces. There are also routes, however, that have a very consistent level of difficulty with no sections that stand out as harder than the rest. In planning a route it is important to know how far it is before the crux is reached, because cruces, also called cruxes,The term is Latin, so strictly the plural is cruces. However, climbing references also use cruxes can only be overcome with sufficient reserves of strength.Kurt Winkler / Hans-Peter Brehm / J\u00fcrg Haltmeier: Technik, Taktik, Sicherheit, SAC Verlag 2008, , pp. 84 ff. == References == Category:Mountaineering Category:Climbing ",
