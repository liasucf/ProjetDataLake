Morse produced 52 episodes of the program, each 30 minutes long. ==Characters and stories== Captain Bart Friday was a globe-trotting San Francisco-based private investigator, portrayed during the series by Elliott Lewis, David Ellis and Russell Thorson. Friday's sidekick from Texas, Skip Turner, was played mostly by Jack Edwards and occasionally by Barton Yarborough. The tales covered such areas as espionage, kidnapping and murder, along with secret Nazi bases, snake worshipers and voodoo. ==Dating problem and episode order== The 52 30-minute episodes (and two sales pitches) were produced in the mid-1940s. Dates of production and the earliest broadcasts are uncertain. Several Internet sites mention that the entire series was broadcast in 1944, but in the final two chapters of It's Dismal to Die, it is clearly stated that the Second World War has ended. Advertisements have been found for broadcasts in 1946 and 1949. The series was presented in 13-episode blocks (each containing two stories), with each ten-chapter story ending with a teaser for the following three-chapter story. The City of the Dead and A Coffin for the Lady are mentioned in the promotional recordings as the first and second story respectively. The order used below is the one found most often on fan sites on the Internet. ==Episodes== *01 The City of the Dead (1 of 10) *02 The City of the Dead (2 of 10) \"I've Dug Up Something Ghastly\" *03 The City of the Dead (3 of 10) \"The Body that Walked Off\" *04 The City of the Dead (4 of 10) \"Old Clawfoot Again\" *05 The City of the Dead (5 of 10) \"The Skeleton Walks In\" *06 The City of the Dead (6 of 10) \"The Ghoul in the Grave\" *07 The City of the Dead (7 of 10) \"Captain Friday Vanishes\" *08 The City of the Dead (8 of 10) \"The Kidnapping of Clawfoot\" *09 The City of the Dead (9 of 10) \"The Trail of the Phantom Church Bell\" *10 The City of the Dead (10 of 10) \"Where the Pearls Were Hidden\" Mysterious adventures in a cemetery known as \"The City of the Dead\" where Captain Friday's father is the caretaker or \"Mayor\", a phantom with clawed feet prowls the graves, a bell rings in an old abandoned church where there is no bell and two young people who seem to have been innocently caught up in events may be more involved than they let on. *11 A Coffin for the Lady (1 of 3) *12 A Coffin for the Lady (2 of 3) \"The Conversation in the Casket\" *13 A Coffin for the Lady (3 of 3) \"The Deepest Grave in the World\" An Army Intelligence officer contacts Captain Friday's San Francisco office, looking to hire a pair of operatives for a mysterious mission.
