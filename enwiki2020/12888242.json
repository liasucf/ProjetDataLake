It served with the Regia Aeronautica and with a number of foreign users, and was licence-produced in Spain and the Soviet Union. Some of the Spanish aircraft were still in service during the Spanish Civil War ==Design and development== The SM.62 flying boat was one of the main successes of Savoia-Marchetti, evolved from the SM.59 which first flew in 1925. The single-engine, single-spar wing, wooden biplane aircraft was powered by a single Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 R.I., engine mounted between the upper and the lower wings, and drove a pusher propeller. It had a wingspan of , a maximum takeoff weight of including fuel, bombs and four crew, and entered production in 1926. Apart from the two machine guns in the aft and forward fuselage, both mounted in uncovered positions, the possibility of fitting an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was explored, but never put into service. The progress of the project was almost continuous, and the following year saw the SM.62bis development that had a more powerful engine. This aircraft, with a wingspan, formed the basis of the future SM.78. The new Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 engine produced 50% more power, which allowed a maximum take-off weight of with a maximum speed of , while the range was . For those times, these were respectable performance figures for a single-engine aircraft. The SM.62 was one of the first Italian racing- and world-record attempting aircraft, competing in the 1926 New-York to Buenos Aires air-race and the air-race in northern Europe, in addition to setting the speed records of averaged over in 1926 \u2013 later augmented to \u2013 and the world records flying while carrying , and finally 100 km (60 mi) and with . This was the most successful Italian flying boat outside Italy, with at least one being acquired by Japan for its naval aviation service, several by Romania, and 40 by Spain, some of which were license-built. The USSR acquired the license to construct the SM.62bis in Taganrog plants as the MBR-4, with many examples built. Romania also acquired the licence to construct the SM.62bis, at the IAR factory in Bra\u0219ov. Five such flying boats were produced in 1936.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941\u20131945, p. 272Francesco Sorge, Giuseppe Genchi, Essays on the History of Mechanical Engineering, Springer, 2015, p. 144Anthony Robinson, The Illustrated encyclopedia of aviation, Volume 11, Marshall Cavendish Corp., 1979 An Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 engine Despite their obsolescence, several Spanish examples fought in the Spanish Civil War. Since the aircraft of those times were not capable of great speeds, several were used at the Desenzano \"high-speed flying-school\" in Italy, as well as continuing to serve as reconnaissance-bombers. The next derivative, the SM.78, with over a ton more weight and 20% more power; could carry a greater fuel load, effectively doubling the range; and was slightly faster than the SM.62bis.
