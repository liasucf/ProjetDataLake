Assabu is around an hour's drive by car from Hakodate and 15 minutes to Esashi. Other transport links include a road from Yakumo on the east coast and a bus to Esashi. The bus-rail links from the Esashi (JR Esashi-Line) and Hakodate railway stations closed in 2014 when the Esashi train line closed. The drive to Sapporo, Hokkaido's largest city, takes around four and one-half hours on the toll expressway; around six hours on the toll-free highways. ==Geography== The municipality is landlocked, comprising several valley basins and is encircled by forest-clad hills, opening out towards the Japan sea to the west.

Public facilities in some areas have been scaled back as a result, including schools. The towns population has been rapidly declining for many years. Assabu has even adopted the slogan \"The World's Loveliest Depopulated Town\" (\u4e16\u754c\u4e00\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u904e\u758e\u306e\u307e\u3061) === Municipalities === As well as the Assabu township itself, which is made up of four areas (Hon-ch\u014d, Midori-machi, Shin- machi and ), the municipal area includes several smaller hamlets, including: * * Iwami * * * * * * * * * Tomiei * == Education == Due to the rapidly decreasing population, schools in Assabu have been decreasing rapidly. In 2018, two Junior High Schools, Tate Junior High School (\u9928\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821) and Uzura Junior High School (\u9d89\u4e2d\u5b66\u6821\uff09 were closed, consolidating all Junior High School students in the district into one school.

Offering an opening in the mountains accessible from the sea, Assabu was established as a forestry camp. As the area was cleared, agriculture followed and farmers began reclamation of land from the swampy drainage basin of local rivers. Like much of the Oshima Peninsula, armed merchants were in the vanguard of local settlers, and one of the mansion-castles typical of the period was established in the area near Tate - In 1869, Assabu briefly fell under the control of shogunate loyalists during the occupation of Hokkaido by forces loyal to the Tokugawa family led by general Enomoto Takeaki. It was returned to the control of the Matsumae feudal clan in the same year after the rebellion in Hokkaido was quashed by the new Meiji Emperor. During this conflict, Tate castle was assaulted by Meiji forces and destroyed. In 1871, the Matsumae clan\u2019s control over their march territories in Hokkaido was dissolved and in 1872, Hokkaido was designated for colonisation and the area administered by the colonial office. In 1906, two village districts in the area were merged receiving the official designation of Assabu-chou. The Assabu yakuba (town council organisation) rejected a merger proposal with the neighbouring Esashi municipality in 2005. Esashi is thought to be financially less well off than Assabu. At the end of July 2006, Assabu townsfolk cooked what was locally called the world's largest potato croquette. Measuring 2.1 meters in diameter and 320 kilograms in weight the behemoth emerged from 180 kilograms of potatoes, and vast quantities of fried minced meat and onions covered with wheat flour and eggs. A crane was used to dip the mix into a vat containing 252 litres of cooking oil. Cooking time was just eight minutes. The croquette was divided into 1,300 servings at a local festival. Every year, a similar-sized potato croquette is made at the local festival held at the end of July. In July 2007, Assabu town is planning to make the world's largest slushy-ice alcoholic drink using locally brewed Shochu. ==References== ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ",
