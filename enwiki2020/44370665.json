He is the first deafblind person to have been made Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2014 for his services to the disabled and is also notable as a champion for deaf and deafblind people. His life is described in autobiography published in 2005: And the Journey Begins (). ==See also== ==Notes== Cyril Axelrod, And the Journey Begins (Douglas McLean, 2005) ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:People from Johannesburg Category:Deafblind people from South Africa Category:Redemptorists Category:Deaf religious workers Category:Deaf people from South Africa Category:South African Jews Category:South African expatriates in China Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:South African expatriates in the United Kingdom ",
