The show premiered on September 16, 2006 as part of CBS's new Saturday morning cartoon block, KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS later KEWLopolis (now Cookie Jar TV).

Reruns of Horseland then aired nationwide on the digital subchannel This TV; two episodes aired each weekend until September 2010.http://www.this.tv Horseland last aired as part of Cookie Jar TV on CBS. It has 7 books for the series related to the episodes which are available to be purchased online. ==Plot== Set on the fictional ranch of Horseland Stables, the series follows the adventures of seven pre-teens (Sarah, Alma, Molly, Chloe, Zoey, Bailey and Will) and their horses, who each deal with their own life situations. Each episode is narrated in flashback by Shep the rough collie, who give its featured lesson to Teeny the pig and Angora the cat in the opening and ending scenes. ==Characters== The characters of Horseland are usually limited to the group of kids who are frequently at the stable. However, some episodes (especially those which involve travelling), introduce one-time characters as a plot device. ===Sarah Whitney and Scarlet=== Sarah is a 12-year-old English-American girl who likes to make friends. She is very friendly and loves to encourage others to do their best and have fun. She comes from a rich family, but does not consider herself better than others because of it. Sarah has wavy yellow hair with bleached highlights and light blue eyes. She also has silver hoop earrings with silver studs in her ears. Sarah's shown to wear a red riding jacket with a matching red necktie and white pants in most episodes. She has been seen in younger ages and different hairstyles in flashbacks. She is voiced by Dana Donlan. Sarah's horse is Scarlet, a purebred black Shagya Arabian mare who has a long, black mane and tail with red highlights. Scarlet is fearless, level-headed, and regal, but at times can be moody and prefer to be left alone. She is patient and loving, much like her owner, and is great with kids. Her symbol is a red crown, representing royalty. She is voiced by Andrea Ware. ===Alma Rodriguez and Button=== Alma is 12 years old and comes from a tight-knit Hispanic family. Her father Jorge has worked as the manager of the stable at Horseland for ten years. An avid reader, Alma seems to take every opportunity to read. She's spirited and competitive, and is one of the best and most dedicated riders Horseland has to offer. She has a pen-pal named Alexander, who seems to have romantic feelings for her. Alma is shown to wear a green riding vest on top of a white long-sleeved shirt and beige pants in most episodes. She is voiced by Emily Hernandez. Alma's horse is Button, a black- and-white Pinto mare with a wavy mane and tail with green highlights. Button is teasing and amiable, loving to play jokes on her friends and owner. When it comes down to it, though, Button can be serious-minded, reliable, and very skilled in show jumping. Like Alma, she has a Hispanic accent. Her symbol is a green four-leaf-clover, representing luck. Her best friend is Calypso and Button is sometimes protective of Calypso. ===Molly Washington and Calypso=== Molly is a 12-year-old African-American girl who often deals with life's problems through humor. She is very funny, creative, and charismatic. She enjoys making fun of herself and, at times, her friends, which can cause them to get annoyed at the fact that she doesn't seem to take much seriously. However, Molly can become serious and ride a horse just as well as the others when her friends are counting on her. She is good at Western riding with Calypso and is the only one to consistently wear her hair in a ponytail. Molly is shown to wear a pink riding jumper and white pants. Her father is a dentist and she has a little sister named Lissa. She is voiced by Aleyah Smith. Molly's horse is Calypso, a chestnut blanket Appaloosa mare with a cream mane and tail with pink highlights. She is amiable, laid back, affectionate, and a little slow. When she learns something once, she's learned it for life. She loves her friends and rider dearly, and is particularly good friends with Button. She speaks with a Jamaican accent. Her symbol is a pink heart, representing love and she's best friends with Button. ===Chloe Stilton and Chili=== Chloe is 12 years old and the twin sister of Zoey. Chloe is the oldest twin and a confident, skilled young girl who likes to let other people know of her talents. She comes from a wealthy family and can often be conceited, self-centered, and shallow. However, like her sister, Chloe can also be very friendly and civil with the other girls. She has an unrequited crush on Bailey, and would go to great lengths to impress him. She is especially fond of clothes and makeup, and loves to look great when she rides. Though Chloe is competitive with her sister, Zoey, they still support each other when it's important. Chloe has strawberry-blonde hair and light green eyes. She is shown to wear a lavender jumper, a lavender headband and purple pants. She is voiced by Bianca Heyward, Caroline Iliff season 3 Chloe's horse is Chili, a light grey Dutch Warmblood stallion with lavender highlights in his mane and tail. Chili shares Chloe's confidence to the point that he feels he is the most talented horse at Horseland, though he often feels upstaged and unappreciated by his showy rider. He and Aztec disagree with each other frequently, but they don't let it ruin their friendship. Both Chili and his rider are talented in dressage. His symbol is a lavender diamond, representing discipline. ===Zoey Stilton and Pepper=== Zoey is 12 years old and the twin sister of Chloe. Zoey is the youngest twin and takes a more sneaky approach with her competitiveness, and is into fashion and makeup. She is talented in cross country, and is even captain of Horseland's cross-country team. She loves to show off and can be quite flirtatious with the boys that she meets. She is competitive with her sister Chloe, but they still support each other when it counts. And like her sister, Zoey can be shallow and rude, though she can also be considerate and nice. Zoey has wavy red hair, freckles and green eyes and is shown to wear a turquoise short-sleeved top and white pants. She is voiced by Caroline Iliff. Zoey's horse, Pepper, is a gorgeous dark grey purebred Dutch Warmblood mare with turquoise highlights in her wavy mane and tail. Pepper is quick-tempered and snappy, sporting a large ego and confidence to match. While she loves her rider and is good friends with Chili, she is usually on bad terms with the other horses, though as a herd they manage to still remain friends. Like Zoey, Pepper is snarky, spirited, and loves to compete. Her symbol is a turquoise crescent moon, representing grace. ===Bailey Handler and Aztec=== Bailey is the 13-year-old son of the Horseland owners. He often takes risks and gambles without considering the consequences of his actions, and enjoys joking around and having a good time. He loves horses and animals, and insists that they be treated with kindness and gentleness. Bailey has a dark brown mullet and dark blue eyes, and is considered the local heartthrob at the stables, much to his own embarrassment. Bailey's shown to wear a dark blue long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up and lighter blue pants. He sometimes wears a cowboy hat. He is voiced by David Kalis. Bailey's horse is Aztec, a brown Kiger Mustang with dark blue highlights. He frequently acts grumpy and nonchalant, but he does genuinely care about his friends and the other animals. He is often protective of his mare friends, much to their irritation, and has shown great courage, determination, and leadership skills. His symbol is a dark blue lightning bolt, representing strength. ===Will Taggert and Jimber=== Will is 15 years old, relaxed, and good looking. Will is often put in charge of the ranch while Bailey's parents are away. He is Bailey's cousin and has lived with Bailey's family ever since he was a little boy. Mature and insightful, he often acts as an adult figure to the rest of the kids and also serves as their riding instructor and mentor. He loves to listen to country music and is great at horse riding, whether it be Western and English. He has blonde hair and gray- blue eyes. He's shown to wear a black short-sleeved shirt with a horseshoe pendant around his neck, and dark blue pants. In \"The Secret\", Will reveals that he has dyslexia, just like Sarah's cousin Chase. He always helps her when she's down and defends her when she is hurt. He is voiced by Vincent Michael. Will's horse is Jimber, a powerful Palomino stallion with black highlights in his mane. Similar to Will, he has a commanding presence among the others at Horseland, and worked as a ranch horse before coming to Horseland. He's a bit older in years in comparison to the other horses, but is dependable and wise. Jimber speaks with a Southern accent. His symbol is a black star, representing loyalty. ===Nani Cloud and Sunburst=== Nani is a 12-year-old Native American girl who appears in multiple episodes during season three. She is proud of her Cherokee heritage and loves nature and horses. Nani has black hair and hazel eyes, and is shown to wear light blue and light yellow. She is quick to defend herself and accidentally stirs up a rivalry between her and Zoey for the position of leadership for the cross-country team at Horseland. She is voiced by Rachel Ware. Nani's horse is Sunburst, a generally calm and polite palomino Paint gelding with yellow highlights. He cannot stand to wear saddles and prefers to be ridden bareback, though he gets used to saddles eventually. Like their owners, he at first starts out on bad terms with Pepper, but the two eventually become friends, and he later begins to show great concern for her well-being. Unlike many of the other horses, he rarely let's mean words affect him. He has a single braid under his mane. His symbol is a yellow sun with blue lights, representing dignity. ===Shep=== Shep is a wise male collie, who acts as the leader of the animals at Horseland, and is the narrator of the series. He is a very loyal ranch dog and always helps the horses in times of trouble. Shep often serves as the voice of reason for Teeny and Angora, and, to illustrate a moral or lesson, frequently relates stories to Teeny (most of the episodes are actually flashbacks to previous events). He is friendly, perceptive, and protective of both the horses and the riders at Horseland. His owner is Bailey. Shep has been with him since he was a pup. Shep would frequently break the fourth wall from time to time, addressing the audience about the episode's lesson. Shep is voiced by Jerry Longe. ===Teeny=== Teeny is a young, adorable, chubby black-and-white potbelly pig who wears a pink ribbon on her tail. She displays an innocent, naive personality, and often becomes anxious over relatively small situations. She is well-intentioned, though simple-minded, and Shep usually acts as a friend and mentor to Teeny, in contrast to Angora, who frequently teases her. ===Angora=== Angora is a gray, long-haired Turkish Angora with bangs that sweep over her eyes, white chest tuft, green eyes and a pink collar. She is often dismissive of other animals, and feels that she deserves better treatment than anyone else, due to her self-absorbed and arrogant nature. Angora's favorite people are Chloe and Zoey because they're so much like her. A running gag in the series involves her love of trouble (and hatred of peace) at Horseland. However, she shows genuine concern whenever Shep and Teeny are in true danger. ===Cubby=== Cubby is a brown Pomeranian puppy. He was found abandoned by Bailey in \"New Pup in Town\". Bailey later adopted Cubby in that same episode. Alma becomes jealous because she wants a dog, but because her dad is the foreman at Horseland she's not allowed to have one. Shep is initially jealous of Cubby. When Cubby runs away Alma and Shep put their jealous feelings aside and help Bailey bring him home. Alma takes Bailey up on his offer to share Cubby with him. Shep and Cubby eventually become friends. ==Secondary characters== ===Simbala and Ranak=== Simbala is an Indian girl who meets the Horseland gang on a trip to France in the episode \"International Sarah\". She is thoughtful, sweet-natured, and is proud of her culture, choosing to wear traditional dress and a bindi. Her father knows Sarah's father, and the two girls became friends after falling into a cave. She loves riding, fresh fruit, and dental floss. Simbala's horse is Ranak, a black stallion with a blaze. He hates plane rides, but enjoys sugar cubes and being alone. After initially irritating the other horses with his worried whinnying, he apologizes and becomes friendly to them. He also has an accent. His color is dark blue. ===Jesse Golden and Buddy=== Jesse is a boy who visits Horseland while his parents' farm, Golden Corral Ranch, is being remodeled. He appears in the episode \"Bailey's New Friend\", in which he unintentionally causes a rift between Bailey and Sarah. Like Bailey, he enjoys video games, taking care of his horse, talking, and being a bit of a daredevil. Both Molly and Alma mention that he's a \"cutie\", and Chloe and Zoey express that they think he is \"hot\". Jesse's horse is Buddy, a large chocolate flaxen stallion. He is brave, headstrong, and misses his home while away. He has dark teal stripes in his mane and tail. ===Alexander Buglick and Bucephalus=== Alexander is Alma's pen pal, seen in the episode \"First Love\". While his letters to her made him seem like a wealthy champion rider, an intentional facade meant to impress her, he really only rides for fun, and is rather timid. His parents are the proprietors of a traveling circus. However, he admires Alma and her incredible riding abilities, and shares her love of reading. He likes to compare himself with the great Macedonian general, Alexander the Great. His horse is a kind, humble stallion named Bucephalus, in honor of Alexander the Great's famous steed. He performs in the circus and enjoys his life, despite its lack of glamour. His color is maroon. ===Mary Whitney and Prince=== Mary is Sarah and Chase's cousin, a humorous, independent girl who doesn't let the fact that she is blind get in the way of her positive attitude and independence. Mary appears in the episode \"A True Gift.\" She has a clever comeback for most insults that Zoey throws at her, and understandably dislikes it when her friends are patronizing toward her. She loves horses, riding, and the outdoors. Mary's horse is Prince, a white Thoroughbred stallion who is said to be the fastest horse ever to come to Horseland, a 'fact' that causes Scarlet to get jealous and worried that she'll be replaced. Sarah temporarily rode him in Scarlet's place in order to make sure that he was a good enough horse for Mary. He also has a white wavy mane and tail with light blue highlights. ===Talia Bentley and Kisses=== Talia is a talented but mean-spirited girl who is both confident and competitive. She appears in the episode \"Changing Spots\" and is the premier show jumper at Stanhope Academy, Horseland's biggest rival. She is Alma's nemesis, and the two show special animosity towards each other after they get in a fight about who deserves to win an upcoming competition. Talia's horse is Kisses, a beautiful Camarillo White Horse mare. She is an excellent show jumper, but is never given a chance to speak to any of the other horses. Her highlight color is light pink. ===Chase Whitney and Wonder=== Chase is Sarah and Mary's cousin who comes to visit in the episode 'The Secret.' He feels embarrassed about his dyslexia and tries to hide his difficulty with reading from the others. Chase has light brown hair and blue eyes. His horse Wonder is a dark bay Anglo- Arabian stallion with green stripes. Wonder never talks to any of the horses in the episode. ==Other characters== ===Jasmine and Amber=== Jasmine and Amber are two of Molly's close friends from the city. Both of the girls are confident, loud, and playful, and enjoy having a good time all the time. Neither of them go to Horseland, but do express an interest in horseback riding. Despite frequently teasing Molly, the two are genuinely supportive of her interests. Amber is African-American, and has dark brown eyes and long wavy hair. Jasmine is of an Asian ethnicity, and has light hazel eyes and dark-colored hair. ===Linnea, Alexia and Windy=== Linnea is a princess that visits Horseland in disguise, pretending to be the princess' assistant, while Alexia, her maid, pretends to be the princess. Both have light blonde hair, blue eyes, and favor the color light pink, although Alexia is much shorter than her companion. Throughout the episode, Linnea becomes close friends with Sarah. Linnea's horse is Windy, a mare who looks like Talia's Kisses and wears an ornate bridle. She also has a volumous wavy mane and tail. She doesn't understand English and only speaks her native tongue, and fails to respond to any of the other horses' attempts to speak to her, causing them to think she was rude. ===Diablo=== Diablo is a red Welsh stallion with an injured back leg who belongs to a girl named Madison. He initially has aggressive and rude behavior and was brought to Horseland so that Sarah could use her \"way with horses\" to try to help him recover. His only appearance is \"The Horse Whisperer\". His name means \"devil\" in Spanish. He also has a wavy mane and tail. He is voiced by D. Kevin Williams. ===Puma=== Puma is a buckskin mustang stallion staying at Horseland to be tamed by Will. His mane and tail are black with white stripes. His only appearance is in the episode \"Wild Horses\". He tells Aztec about what it's like living in the wild, which prompts Aztec to run away. Puma, however, loved the wonderful treatment he was given at Horseland. It is mentioned that he loves oats, which is shown in the same episode. ===Wild Horses=== These horses are met by Aztec when he runs away from Horseland. The two identified by name are Chaco, a black mustang stallion who doesn't want Aztec on their territory, and Mesa, a cream colt that befriends Aztec. Other horses in the herd are a pair of bays, Mesa's cream mother, and a brown paint female. They all have plain manes and tails. ===River=== River is a famous racehorse stallion that comes to Horseland to recuperate from a leg injury. He is dark grey with a white mane and tail, and has periwinkle stripes. His only appearance is \"A Horse Named River\", during which it's revealed that he's become an elderly, unenthusiastic horse, nothing like the speedy youthful stallion Chili's been a fan of his whole life. He was younger and belonged to an unnamed girl in flashbacks. ===Cream and Sugar=== Cream is a white-colored colt that has light pink stripes, while Sugar is a light gray filly that has light blue stripes. They are fraternal twins, and only appear in the episode \"Oh, Baby\". They visit Horseland when their mother was sick and couldn't take care of them. ==Additional Voices== *Dana Donlan as Sarah Whitney *Emily Hernandez as Alma Rodriguez *Bianca Heyward as Chloe Stilton *Caroline Iliff as Zoey Stilton/Chloe Stilton, Season 3 *David Kalis as Bailey Handler *Jerry Longe as Shep *Laura Marr *Vincent Michael as Will Taggert *Marissa Shea *Aleyah Smith as Molly Washington *Michelle Zacharia *Joe Dinghman *Ben Birkholtz *Courtney Britt *Tifanie Christun as Pepper *Stephen Shelton *Andrea Ware as Scarlet *Kelcey Watson *Tiffany White-Welchen *D.
