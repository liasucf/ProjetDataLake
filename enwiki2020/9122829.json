    "text": "The Human Development Index is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. It is a standard means of measuring well-being. It is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed, developing, or underdeveloped country, and also to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life. Countries (almost all UN member states and a couple of special territories) fall into four broad categories based on their HDI: very high, high, medium and low human development. ==List of African countries== thumb|400px|African countries by Human Development Index (2019 report, showing 2018 data) {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; background:none;\" |- |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\"| |} The table below presents the latest Human Development Index (HDI) for countries in Africa as included in the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report, released on 9 December 2019 and based on data collected in 2018. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! colspan=\"5\" |List of African countries by Human Development Index |- !
