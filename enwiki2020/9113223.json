As an honor society, its purpose is to recognize persons of superior scholastic achievement and high potential for professional leadership. As a professional association, its purpose is to stimulate independent-thinking educators who can ask critical questions to improve educational policies and practices. Pi Lambda Theta's mission is to honor outstanding educators and inspire their leadership on critical education issues. PLT extends membership to students majoring in education who demonstrate academic excellence, as well as to professional educators who have earned a PLT-recognized award such as certification by the National board for professional teaching standards in the United States. == Membership == Pi Lambda Theta has the most stringent GPA requirements for membership. Eligible candidates must have a 3.5 GPA or higher and must be one of the following: *Undergraduate sophomores, recent graduates, or graduate students who intend to pursue a career in education; or *Current educators or education professionals/support staff. == History and governance == Pi Lambda Theta was organized on July 7, 1910 at the University of Missouri. Seven years later, educational honoraries from six other universities joined Pi Lambda Theta to form a national association to advance education as a profession. Members can be found in all 50 states and in many countries throughout the world. Pi Lambda Theta is a member of the Phi Delta Kappa International family of education associations and is governed by the PDK International Board of Directors. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Honor societies Category:Student organizations established in 1910 Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Former members of Professional Fraternity Association Category:1910 establishments in Missouri ",
