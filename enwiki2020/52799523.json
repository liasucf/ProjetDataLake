    "text": "is a Japanese social network game developed and published by Square Enix. == Plot == The newly established private high school for girls, Goryoukan Academy, has a hidden face that people on the outside don't know about. The world you know is under threat by aliens, named \"Oburi\" (apparitions). These enemies are too strong for normal humans, and are especially threatening due to the fact that they can travel through to the 'fourth' dimension where they can be safe. For some reason, certain young girls are able to harness the power to transverse these dimensions, and enter a 'fifth' dimension - a parallel universe. The only ones capable of fighting this enemy of mankind are girls known as \"Strikers\", who have the ability to sense the fifth dimension. Goryoukan Academy is actually an organization that seeks out girls who are more than meets the eye and trains them up for the \"Fifth Force\", a combat force created to subjugate the Oburi. There are endless amounts of parallel universes, all of which are similar but run in their own way. The Strikers are able to fight the Oburi by searching these alternate worlds for alternative \"memory cards\" (Memoca) costumes that are usable by them and effective against the \"Oburi\". You have been chosen by a mysterious person to lead a group of 5 girls in defeating an enemy that is threatening to destroy the world. Why you were chosen and who you are yourself is a mystery... ==Characters== ===Fifth Force=== The is combat unit established by Goryoukan Academy for Strikers to battle the Oburi.

Other Characters === Other Characters === ; : == Gameplay == Schoolgirl Strikers is a card collecting mobile game with RPG and visual novel influences. It was released in 2014 and is available for iOS and Android devices. Some of the things that make Schoolgirl Strikers different from your average card collecting game are the special story missions and the 3D battle system; along with the ability to dress the girls up as you see fit. The way the battle system as a whole works is also quite different; you can choose any girls you want (limited to 5 at a time) to be in your team as long as you have at least one card of them. Then you add main and sub \"Memocas\" to them instead of just simply putting the cards themselves in a battle deck. The main Memocas also affect the girls' appearances in battle. == Reception == ==Media== ===Anime=== An original anime television adaption has been announced, Hiroshi Nishikiori directed the series at J.C.Staff with scripts written by Takao Yoshioka and Mizuto Suzuki and Kengo Tokusashi produced the music at Square Enix.
