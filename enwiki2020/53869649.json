Diret\u00f3rio Mon\u00e1rquico do Brasil (English: Brazilian Monarchical Directory) was a monarchist institution created in 1890 in Rio de Janeiro, one year past the Proclamation of the Republic. Its founder was Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, the Viscount of Ouro Preto, last Prime Minister of the Empire of Brazil Founded in the first year of the republic, the directory started out with illegal character. Its main objective was to organize the royalists of the country and to report directly to the then exiled Brazilian Imperial Family \u2013 to Emperor Pedro II and, later on, to Princess Isabel. The directory was responsible for the monarchist acts present in various events in Brazilian history, such as in the resignation of Deodoro da Fonseca and in the Revolta da Armada. It was also in the institution's headquarters that Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, Prince of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, son of Princess Isabel, signed his official resignation, which was issued by the directory itself. ==Foundation Manifesto== In 1890, the Viscount of Ouro Preto issued the manifesto that created the directory: \"The Brazilian republic, as it was proclaimed, is a coup, a work of iniquity. The republic has risen on the bucklers of the mutinous soldiery, comes from a criminal origin, was carried out by means of an attack unprecedented in history and shall have an ephemeral existence!\" ==References== * ANPUH: https://web.archive.org/web/20170313044501/http://anais.anpuh.org/wp- content/uploads/mp/pdf/ANPUH.S25.0024.pdf * Quest\u00e3o din\u00e1stica brasileira * Causa Imperial: http://causaimperial.com.br/822/ Category:Monarchist organizations ",
