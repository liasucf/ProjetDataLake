    "text": "Rajagopal P. V., a Gandhian activist, is a former Vice Chairman of the Gandhi Peace Foundation, New Delhi. and the president and founding member of Ekta Parishad, Rajagopal started his peace-building by working alongside Gandhian stalwarts J.P. Narayan and Subba Rao to disarm 578 dacoits (outlaws) in Chambal region of India in 1972. Thereafter the young Gandhian turned away from dealing with the direct violence and the cycle of revenge of dacoits, to the indirect violence suffered by Adivasis, bonded labourers and other landless communities affected from poverty and exploitation. Over the course of 30 years (1989 to 2018) Rajagopal trained thousands of rural young people to be in villages as trainer-leaders to build up community leadership and people\u2019s action. This culminated in many state activities, and then two national actions, one in 2007 when 25,000 landless poor, mainly Adivasis, marched 350-kilometre yatra from Gwalior to the capital Delhi to demand the land reforms promised at Independence. \u2018The government was forced to agree to all the demands that we made in that long march.\u2019 This led to the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. And the second in 2012 Rajagopal led a march of 100,000 people to the capital of the nation to demand people\u2019s control over land and livelihood resources and the movement signed a ten point agreement with the Government of India. In 2018 Rajagopal is embarking on a more ambitious agenda of mobilizing one million people to nonviolently address their livelihood rights. In 2019 in celebrating Gandhi\u2019s 150 years, Rajagopal is planning to take Gandhi\u2019s message across the Globe as a way to spread peace and nonviolence. (www.jaijagat2020.org.) Rajagopal's main contribution can be seen as showing a nonviolent approach for millions of people to use to address their grievances and also to enhance dialogue with the state. == Biography == Rajagopal was born in 1948, the fourth of five children, in Thillenkery, a village in Kerala, south India. His full name is Rajagopal Puthan Veetil, but he now chooses to use only his first name in public in order to avoid any caste-related stereotyping that might be associated with his full name. Rajagopal's father was an activist fighting for India's independence and therefore was frequently separated from his family. Rajagopal attended the grade school at Seva Mandir, being taught in Malayalam language. The school followed Gandhi's philosophical principles with regard to life and work in a community. He later studied classical Indian dance and music, prior to completing his education at Sevagram, Gandhi's Ashram in Maharashtra, with a degree in agricultural engineering. This is also where Rajagopal learned to speak English. In the early 1970s, he worked in the violence-ridden area of Chambal in Madhya Pradesh to help rehabilitate dacoits. Since 2001, Rajagopal is married to Jill Carr-Harris, a Canadian fellow social activist. 2011-Till Date * Special Invitee to Sarva Seva Sangh- A national body of Gandhian organization. * Member of Gandhi Seva Sangh- An organization promoting Gandhian values and ideas through publications * Member of the Planning Commission, Govt. of India, Working Group for the 12th Five Year Plan on Disadvantaged Farmers * Member of All India Nai Talim Society, an institute created to promote the educational system proposed by Gandhi * Organized a long march Jansatyagraha of 100, 000 people from Gwalior to Delhi on the issue of land reforms.

With a track record of ten state level foot-marches, he led a national march to Delhi in October 2007. In the march, Janadesh 2007 25,000 people marched 340 kilometers from Gwalior to Delhi and compelled the Government to take action in land reforms and forest rights. ==Jan Satyagraha 2012== Rajgopal addressing in Jan Satyagraha 2012 Though the Land Reform Commission has issued its report, the government has not yet accepted it. == Jan Andolan 2018 == In October 2018, Rajagopal led a march from Gwalior to Morena with around 25,000 people asking for land rights and tribal rights.

Political leaders such as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan addressed the marchers in Gwalior before their departure, promising to create a committee to address land rights issues.

Rajagopal accuses Modi of being pro- corporate and claims that it will further aggravate the difference between the rich and poor in the country. ==Documentation== Articles: * Voice of Hope and Voice for Change (English)\u2013 A collection of articles by Rajagopal P.V. published by National Center for Advocacy Studies, Pune * Land for Life (English) A collection of village data during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by National Center for Advocacy Studies, Pune * Main ne Dekha Hain (Hindi)-A collection of village stories during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by Ekta Parishad * Pagdandiyom par paav (Hindi)-A collection of village people\u2019s story during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by Ekta Parishad * Gulamon ki Basti se Gujar raha hoon (Hindi)-A collection of village based story during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by Ekta Parishad * Jo Ghar Khoya Apana (Hindi)-A collection of village data during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by Ekta Parishad * Sab ki apani Ho Jameen (Hindi)-A collection of village data during the foot march by Rajagopal P.V. published by Ekta Parishad * Journey to the other India \u2013 a collection of articles in English during the year long samwad yatra in 2011 \u2013 2012 * The legacy of Gandhi\u00bb, Rajagopal P.V. \u2013 a life for non-violent resistance by Carmen Zanella of Switzerland * Biography of Rajagopal by Dr.Julius Ruibke of German Audio-Visual * \"Janadesh\" (Peopl\u2019s Verdict) A Film on 25000 people on foot in 2007 from Gwalior to Delhi (English, Hindi, Spanish, German and French) Film makers from France, Switzerland, Spain and India. * \"Land First\" A Film on Orissa foot march by Amanda, England * \"Is Small still Beautiful\" A Film Broadcast on BBC News, Traccy Winchester, England * \"Raja\u2019s Raise\" A Film based on a story of Elephant, Karl Saurer from Switzerland * \"Ahimsa\"(based on Non-Violence training and Social action), Karl Saurer from Switzerland * \"Jansatyagrah\"(Truth Force) Rajagopal and his initiatives, Vikram Nayak, New Delhi * \"Peoples Movement Processes\",Praveen Pagare, Nasik * \"Jan Chetana Ka Uday\" Struggle of Peoples Movement,Ritu Datta , New Delhi * \"Manzil ki Aur\" Community based Nonviolent Struggle for right, Ritu Datta, New Delhi * \"Millions can walk\" Film on Jansatyagraha by Christoph Schaub, Switzerland * Nari Shakti Zindabad (Women Empowerment & Leadership), Praveen Pagare, Nasik * Interview on DD National - Aaj Savere Program, DD National == Awards == In 2014, he received the Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration, an award granted annually by the Indian National Congress party. {| class=\"wikitable\" |2008 |Friend of the Poor award K.
