This, it is said, Euripides used in his tragedy which bears the same title, although modern scholarship is divided on which tragedy came first. Neophron likely lived in the second half of the fifth century B.C. and was a rough contemporary of Euripides. As Suidas tells us, he introduced in his plays the torture of slaves, such scenes, according to the canons of dramatic art, not being enacted on the stage, but merely referred to by messengers. Alexander the Great had Neophron executed along with the philosopher Callisthenes.Suda \u03bd 218 == See also == For a discussion of the surviving fragments of Neophron and their relation to Euripides' Medeia, see the introduction to D.
