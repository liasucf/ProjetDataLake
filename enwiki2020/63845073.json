    "text": "The Mansion of Madness (released in Mexico as La mansi\u00f3n de la locura, in the UK as House of Madness, and in the USA as Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon) is a 1973 Mexican horror film directed by Juan L\u00f3pez Moctezuma. It is loosely based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. The film is the directorial debut of Juan L\u00f3pez Moctezuma, who went on to make Mary, Mary, Bloody Mary (1975) and Alucarda (1977), among others. Surrealist artist Leonora Carrington supervised sets and costumes with one of her sons, Gabriel Weisz. The repeated appearance of a white horse, Carrington\u2019s alter ego, and the elaborate surreal feasts and costumes has been credited as demonstrating the artist\u2019s vision and several of her recurring motifs. The film was a Mexican production and was shot in Mexico, using a mostly Mexican cast and crew. It was filmed in English and then dubbed into Spanish for Mexican cinemas. ==Plot== The film is set in France in the 19th century. Gaston LeBlanc visits Dr. Maillard in his spacious sanatorium to witness his revolutionary treatments. He is introduced to the doctor\u2019s lovely niece Eug\u00e9nie, and is taken on a tour. He has several odd encounters with the patients, who seem to roam free. As LeBlanc observes the increasingly eccentric methods of Dr. Maillard's \"soothing system\" he begins to question the mental stability of the doctor. In the doctor's dungeon, innocent people are chained, tortured and stuck in glass cages, then forced to take part in gruesome games of ritual slaughter. ==Cast== * Claudio Brook (as Claude Brook) - Dr. Maillard / Raoul Fragonard * Arthur Hansel - Gaston LeBlanc * Ellen Sherman - Eug\u00e9nie * Martin LaSalle - Julien Couvier == Reception == Scream magazine reviewed The Mansions of Madness in 2016, writing that \"if you manage to see beyond its jarring shortcomings, you will be treated to a film that is not only visually stunning, but which also leaves you with a frisson of disturbing melancholy that will haunt you for days to come.\" In a review of the Mondo Macabro release, DVD Talk noted that \"Mondo Macabro's package text does its best to hype the film, which is described as \"Like a Monty Python film directed by Fellini ... on acid!\" It's an impressive movie, even though it doesn't quite live up to that claim.\" ===Awards=== The Mansion of Madness won the Laceno d'oro prize and a Special Mention for Claudio Brook's performance at the XIV Avellino Neorealist and Avant-garde Film Festival, Italy; a Special Mention at the Brave New World Festival in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (1973); it was also awarded a Special Mention at the Locarno Festival, Switzerland (1973), and a Gold Medal at the Paris International Fantastic Film and Science Fiction Festival (1974). ==References== ==External links== * * La mansi\u00f3n de la locura at BFI Category:Mexican films Category:1973 films Category:English-language films Category:1973 horror films Category:Mexican horror films Category:Films based on works by Edgar Allan Poe ",
