It spawned several singles, including \"Spend Some Time\" which spent two weeks at number two on the American dance charts. A cover of Maria Muldaur's \"Midnight at the Oasis\" became popular in the UK, but was not included in the US version of the album. Brother Sister was lead singer N'Dea Davenport's last album with the Brand New Heavies before leaving to complete her solo album (which she had put on hold to join the Heavies). She returned to join the band ten years later. == Track listing == == Personnel == The Brand New Heavies * N'Dea Davenport \u2013 lead and backing vocals, keyboards, percussion * Simon Bartholomew \u2013 guitar, backing vocals, percussion * Andrew Levy \u2013 bass, backing vocals, keyboards, percussion, string arrangements * Jan Kincaid \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals, percussion, keyboards Musicians * Maxton G.
