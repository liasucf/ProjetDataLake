From the start it was available on UPC Nederland, Casema and Mr. Zap. On 1 February 2001 CineNova launched a second television channel called CineNova 2. It is a +1 hour timeshift channel of the main channel. In 2004 CineNova acquired the broadcasting rights for live coverage of the Oscars ceremony. With the acquisition of the Dutch Canal+ channels by Chellomedia (sister company of UPC Nederland), the major cable companies such as UPC, Essent and Multikabel decided to remove the CineNova channels.
