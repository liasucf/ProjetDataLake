    "text": "James Bandinel (19 May 1814 - 1892) was a British clergyman, author and poet. He was born on 19 May 1814, only son of James Bandinel of the Foreign Office and his wife, Marian Eliza, n\u00e9e Hunter. ==Career Synopsis== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Years ! Post !

The Athenaeum Journal speaks of \"the harpings of the Rev. James Bandinel\"Athenaeum Journal, 27 December 1851 and the Literary Churchman describes his \"long and laboured discourse\",Literary Churchman, 15 January 1859 while the Church of England Quarterly Review notes that his poem entitled \"Lufra\" was \"highly interesting\" and its treatment \"exceedingly artistic\".Church of England Quarterly Review, April 1852 There can be small doubt that Bandinel's achievement lies less in reaching a widespread readership (such as the novels of Charles Dickens attracted popular attention) than in his principled, kind, genuine style. He is perhaps unfortunate in having been harshly scrutinised by the national press when, at a local level, his literature was valued and estimated by his parishioners. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
