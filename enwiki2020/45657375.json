    "text": "The 2015 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament was played between March 13 and March 21, 2015, at four conference arenas and the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. By winning the tournament, Minnesota State was awarded the Broadmoor Trophy and received the WCHA's automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. ==Format== The first round of the postseason tournament features a best-of-three games format. The top eight or ten conference teams participate in the tournament. Teams are seeded No. 1 through No. 8 according to their final conference standing, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with an identical number of points accumulated. The top four seeded teams each earn home ice and host one of the lower seeded teams. The winners of the first round series advance to the Xcel Energy Center for the WCHA Final Five, a holdover from previous tournaments where it was used as the collective name of the quarterfinal, semifinal, and championship rounds. The Final Five uses a single-elimination format. Teams are re-seeded No. 1 through No. 4 according to the final regular season conference standings. ===Conference Standings=== Note: GP = Games Played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; PTS = Points; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against ==Bracket== Teams are reseeded after the first round Note: * denotes overtime periods ==Results== ===First Round=== All times are local. ====(1) Minnesota State vs. (8) Lake Superior State==== ====(2) Michigan Tech vs. (7) Alabama\u2013Huntsville==== ====(3) Bowling Green vs. (6) Northern Michigan==== ====(4) Bemidji State vs. (5) Ferris State==== ===Semifinals=== All times are local (UTC\u22125). ====(3) Bowling Green vs. (2) Michigan Tech==== ====(5) Ferris State vs. (1) Minnesota State==== ===Championship=== All times are local (UTC\u22125). ====(2) Michigan Tech vs. (1) Minnesota State==== ==Tournament awards== ===All-Tournament Team=== *F Tyler Heinonen, So.
