In the US the film was released as Black Plague. ==Plot== The film is set in England in 1348. While the Hundred Years War rages on between England and France, a detachment of soldiers returns to the estate of the beautiful English noblewoman Lady Matilda (Lena Headey) with news that her husband, Sir Walter de Mellerby (Jon Finch), was captured and remains hostage in France. Meanwhile, the soldiers led by her husband's nephew Nicholas (Jason Flemyng) have brought with them a prisoner, Jacques de Saint Amant (David La Haye), the son of the one holding her husband. He can be exchanged for Sir Walter and for an additional ransom, which will save her estate from bankruptcy, as they are deeply in debt to the bishop. When Lady Matilda asks the bishop (Ian McNeice) for time to get the ransom, he informs her that he will expect sexual favors from her if the money does not arrive. After some time, however, the inhabitants of the manor begin to die, one by one, a mysterious and painful death. Lady Matilda starts suspecting that the prisoner, whom she has come to care for, is not what he claims to be. ==Cast== *Lena Headey as Lady Matilda Mellerby *David La Haye as Jacques de Saint Amant *Jason Flemyng as Nicholas *Christopher Fairbank as Steward *Anthony O'Donnell as Randall *Jeff Nuttall as Priest *Ralph Riach as Physician *Hayley Carmichael as Agnes *Ian McNeice as Bishop *Jon Finch as Sir Walter de Mellerby ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2002 films Category:2000s thriller films Category:English-language films Category:British films Category:Films set in the 14th century ",
