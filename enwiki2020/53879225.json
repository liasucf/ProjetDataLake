    "text": "Dom Ignatios Firzli (April 25, 1913 - August 10, 1997), also known in Brazilian Portuguese as Ignatios Ferzli was a Melkite Greek Orthodox Christian priest and theologian who became Antiochian Metropolitan Bishop of Sao Paulo and head of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch for Brazil and South America. He is also known as Father Ignatios of Sao Paulo in the Melkite Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. ==Life== Father Ignatios (or \u2018Ignatius\u2019) was born in Zahleh, Ottoman Syria (now Lebanon), on April 25, 1913. After graduating from the Byzantine Antiochian Patriarchal School of Theology of Damascus, he was ordained into the Greek Orthodox priesthood in 1933 for the Diocese of Alexandria, Kingdom of Egypt, then an autonomous part of the British Empire. He furthered his study of Byzantine Christian theology at the Patriarchical Halki seminary in Istanbul, Turkey, alongside his longtime friend father Parthenios Koinidis, who later became head of the Greek Orthodox Church of Egypt, Sudan and Africa under the name of Patriarch Parthenius III of Alexandria. Father Ignatios graduated in 1939, at the start of the Second World War, and chose to return to Egypt, where he was raised to the rank of Grand Archimandrite (\u2018Senior Superior Abbott\u2019) of the Greek Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. He was then appointed Metropolitan Bishop of Sao Paulo for the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, thus becoming the de facto head of the Syro-Lebanese Greek Orthodox diasporas of Brazil and South America. He famously said: \u201cEverything went so that I would serve Orthodoxy on the throne of St. Mark [the Greek Church of Egypt, Sudan and Africa], when, to my great surprise, I was assigned to serve on the throne of St. Paul [the Greek Church of Southern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Northeastern Israel], and, all of a sudden, my personal mission was \u2018diverted\u2019 to Brazil\".Orthodox Wiki: Ignatios (Ferzli) de S\u00e3o Paulo ==Legacy== Dom Ignatios served as spiritual leader of the Syro-Lebanese Byzantine Christian communities of Brazil and South America throughout most of the Cold War, a particularly tense period characterized by social and political upheavals in Latin America. He is remembered as a polyglot and polymath who could \u201cspeak and write fluently English, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Modern Greek, Classical Arabic, Turkish and Armenian\u201d Orthodox Wiki: Ignatios (Ferzli) de S\u00e3o Paulo His personal assistant and sexton (or \u2018Shammes\u2019 in Ancient Hebrew and Levantine Arabic) who served for many years under Dom Ignatios at the Syro-Lebanese Greek-Orthodox Central Church of Sao Paulo (known as \u2018Da Igreja Ortodoxa da Rua Vergueiro\u2019) was Father Habib Haddad (\u2018Cury Habib\u2019), the paternal grandfather of Fernando Haddad, the mayor of Sao Paulo.PREFEITO MANT\u00c9M 'DINASTIA' LIBANESA (\u201cThe Mayor Perpetuates a Lebanese \u2018Dynasty\u2019\u2026\u201d ==See also== *Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1997 deaths Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:Ottoman people of Levantine-Eastern Orthodox Christian descent Category:Members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch Category:Greek Orthodox Christians from the Ottoman Empire Category:Greek Orthodox Christians from Lebanon Category:Greek Orthodox Christians from Egypt Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Brazilian people of Levantine-Eastern Orthodox Christian descent Category:Egyptian people of Levantine-Eastern Orthodox Christian descent Category:People from Alexandria Category:Levantine-Egyptians Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Brazil Category:Theological School of Halki alumni ",
