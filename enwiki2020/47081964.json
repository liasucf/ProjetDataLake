    "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Sri Lanka in October/November 2015 to play two Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Starting with this series, all bilateral Test tours between the West Indies and Sri Lanka will be called the Sobers\u2013Tissera Trophy. Sri Lanka won the Test series 2\u20130, the ODI series 3\u20130 with the T20I series was drawn 1\u20131. The whole series was rain affected and the play was interrupted on numerous occasions. All three matches in the ODI series were rain interrupted and the results were all determined by the Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method. The second T20I match, which was originally scheduled to be held on 12 November 2015 was rescheduled and was held on 11 November at the R Premadasa Stadium, after discussions with the relevant Cricket Boards of the two nations. The T20I was rescheduled as 12 November was declared a national day of mourning by the government, due to the death of Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero, with Thero's funeral being held on the 12th. Also, there was a minute of silence prior to the match and the Sri Lankan cricketers wore a yellow band on their arms as a gesture of respect. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs !colspan=2|T20I |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Angelo Mathews (c) * Lahiru Thirimanne (vc) * Dushmantha Chameera * Dinesh Chandimal * Rangana Herath * Dimuth Karunaratne * Tharindu Kaushal * Suranga Lakmal * Kusal Mendis * Dilruwan Perera * Kusal Perera(wk) * Nuwan Pradeep * Dhammika Prasad * Kaushal Silva * Milinda Siriwardana | * Jason Holder (c) * Kraigg Brathwaite (vc) * Devendra Bishoo * Jermaine Blackwood * Carlos Brathwaite * Darren Bravo * Rajindra Chandrika * Shane Dowrich * Shannon Gabriel * Shai Hope * Denesh Ramdin (wk) * Kemar Roach * Marlon Samuels * Jerome Taylor * Jomel Warrican | * Angelo Mathews(c) * Lahiru Thirimanne (vc) * Dushmantha Chameera * Dinesh Chandimal * Tillakaratne Dilshan * Danushka Gunathilaka * Shehan Jayasuriya * Nuwan Kulasekara * Suranga Lakmal * Lasith Malinga * Ajantha Mendis * Kusal Perera (wk) * Sachithra Senanayake * Milinda Siriwardana * Jeffrey Vandersay | * Jason Holder (c) * Devendra Bishoo * Jermaine Blackwood * Carlos Brathwaite * Darren Bravo * Jonathan Carter * Johnson Charles * Andre Fletcher * Jason Mohammed * Sunil Narine * Denesh Ramdin * Ravi Rampaul * Andre Russell * Marlon Samuels * Jerome Taylor | *Lasith Malinga (c) *Tillakaratne Dilshan *Kusal Perera (wk) *Shehan Jayasuriya *Angelo Mathews *Milinda Siriwardene *Chamara Kapugedera *Dinesh Chandimal *Kithuruwan Vithanage *Dushmantha Chameera *Nuwan Kulasekara *Sachithra Senanayake *Jeffrey Vandersay *Binura Fernando *Thisara Perera | * Daren Sammy (c) * ~~Samuel Badree~~ * Darren Bravo * Dwayne Bravo * Jonathan Carter * Johnson Charles * Andre Fletcher * Jason Holder * Sunil Narine * Kieron Pollard * Denesh Ramdin * Ravi Rampaul * Andre Russell * Marlon Samuels * Jerome Taylor * Devendra Bishoo |} West Indies bowler Samuel Badree was ruled out of the T20I series after contracting dengue fever.
