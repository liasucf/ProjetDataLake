    "text": "The Samsung Gear S3 is a Tizen-based circular smartwatch developed by Samsung Electronics. It was released on 18 November 2016. There are two models of the Gear S3, Classic and Frontier. The Classic has a silver watch case and black leather band, while the Frontier has a black watch case and rubber band. Both are rated IP68 (water resistant) and have GPS and heart rate monitor sensors. One notable feature is that the bezel ring rotates as part of the user interface, although users can also navigate by swiping the screen and/or using the two buttons on the side. The Gear S3's successor, the Samsung Galaxy Watch, was released 9 August 2018. ==Comparison of models== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Model !style=\"background:#3d4;\"| Gear S3 Frontier !style=\"background:#3d4;\"| Gear S3 Frontier (LTE) !style=\"background:#3d4;\"|Gear S3 Classic (LTE) (Bluetooth\u00ae) |- |Display |colspan=\"3\" |1.3\u201d Circular Super AMOLED, 360 x 360, 278ppi, Always-on display, Corning Gorilla Glass SR+ |- |Processor | colspan=\"3\" |Exynos 7270 Dual Core 1.0 GHz |- |Operating System | colspan=\"3\" |Tizen Based Wearable Platform 4.0.0.7 Update Jun 2020 |- |Size |colspan=\"3\" |49 x 46 x 12.9 |- |Weight |colspan=\"2\" |62g |57g |- |Memory | colspan=\"3\" |4GB Internal memory, 768MB RAM |- |Connectivity |Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi b/g/n, NFC, MST, GPS/Glonass |3G/LTE, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi b/g/n, NFC, MST, A-GPS/Glonass |Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi b/g/n, NFC, MST, GPS/Glonass |- |Sensors | colspan=\"3\" |Accelerometer, Gyro, Barometer, HRM, Ambient light, Speedometer |- |Battery | colspan=\"3\" |380 mAh Li-Ion battery |- |Charging Technology | colspan=\"3\" |Wireless charging (WPC Inductive) |- |Part No. |SM-R760 |SM-R765 |SM-R770 |} The \"LTE\" models are further divided into sub-models depending on the target country and Service Provider cellular infrastructure available. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Model !Target Country !Service Providers !LTE Support !LTE Band (Frequency) !UMTS Support !UTMS Band (Frequency) |- | SM-R765A | USA | AT&T; | LTE | B2 (1900 PCS), B4 (1700/2100 AWS 1), B5 (850) & B17 (700 bc) | UMTS | B1 (2100), B2 (1900 PCS) & B5 (850) |- | SM-R765F | Singapore | Singtel & Starhub | LTE, LTE 100/50 & LTE 150/50 | B1 (2100), B3 (1800 +) & B5 (850) | UMTS, HSUPA, HSUPA 5.8 & HSDPA | B1 (2100) |- | SM-R765L | Korea | | LTE, LTE 100/50 & LTE 150/50 | B5 (850) |- |SM-R765N |New Zealand |Spark | | |3G WCDMA |B5 (850) |- | SM-R765S | Korea | | LTE | B5 (850) |- | SM-R765T | USA | T-Mobile | LTE | B2 (1900 PCS), B4 (1700/2100 AWS 1) & B5 (850) | UMTS | B1 (2100), B2 (1900 PCS), B4 (1700/2100 AWS 1) & B5 (850) |- | SM-R765V | USA | Verizon | LTE, LTE 100/50 & LTE 150/50 | B4 (1700/2100 AWS 1) & B13 (700 c) |- | SM-R775S | Korea | | LTE | B5 (850) |} ==See also== * Samsung Galaxy == References == == External links == * Official page * New Tizen 3.0 Update Now Available For Samsung Gear S3 Category:Tizen-based devices Category:Products introduced in 2016 Category:Smartwatches Category:Samsung wearable devices ",
