    "text": "{| |} The Benz Bz.IIIb was an eight-cylinder, water-cooled, V-engine developed in Germany for use in aircraft in 1918. ==Design and development== Inspired by the Hispano-Suiza 8, some of which were captured and tested, the Benz Bz.IIIb was a fairly large engine, but its performance was disappointing. Despite not being accepted for service use a number of late World War I prototype German aircraft used the Bz.IIIb, the Benz IIIbo and the geared Benz IIIbm. The latter suffered from vibration problems.Green & Swanborough (1994) p.339 ==Applications== * AEG DJ.I * AEG PE * Albatros D.X * Albatros Dr.II * LFG Roland D.VII * LFG Roland D.VIII ==Specifications (Benz Bz.IIIb)== ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:1910s aircraft piston engines ",
