He was a member of the Romanian Academy. ==Biography== Born in Szelistye (now S\u0103li\u0219te, Transylvania, at the time part of Austria-Hungary), Lupa\u015f attended between 1886 and 1891 the primary school in his home village. In 1892 he started attending the State School in Nagyszeben (Sibiu), but, due to a conflict on national topics with his history teacher \u00c1rp\u00e1d Trompa, he was forced to move (together with his colleague Octavian Goga) to the Andrei \u0218aguna Orthodox School in Brass\u00f3 (Bra\u015fov), from where he graduated in 1900. He studied Philosophy and Literature at the University of Budapest on a \"Gojdu Foundation\" scholarship, graduating in 1904, and received his PhD from the University of Berlin (1905) with the thesis The Romanian Orthodox Church in Transylvania and the Communion with Rome in the 18th Century. Between 1905 and 1909, Lupa\u015f taught Church History and Romanian History at the \"Andreian\" Institute of Theology in Sibiu and attended Theology courses. During his studies he made his debut in journalism and co-founded the Romanian-language Luceaf\u0103rul magazine. In November 1907, Lupa\u015f was brought to trial for seditious libel, being accused of having instigated the peasants to hatred against the landowners, and sentenced to three months imprisonment and a 200 Krone-fine. He served his three month-sentence in Szeged between August and October 1908, forced out of the Institute in 1909, and appointed priest to the S\u0103li\u015fte parish. The Romanian Academy elected him an associate member in 1914 and full member in 1916, at Nicolae Iorga's suggestion. However, due to the war, he managed to deliver his acceptance speech before the Academy on 8 June 1920. After Romania's entry in World War I on the Allied side, Lupa\u015f was exiled to Sopron County (western Hungary) and placed under house arrest. In 1918, he was elected representative for S\u0103li\u015fte in the Transylvanian National Assembly that declared the Union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania. Starting with 1919 he became professor at the University of Cluj, teaching Modern History and Transylvanian History until 1946, and in 1920, together with Alexandru Lapedatu, co-founded the National History Institute, located also in Cluj; he also taught Church History at the Theological Academy. Lupa\u015f was elected president of the History Section of ASTRA and, between 1932 and 1935, president of the History Section of the Romanian Academy. In the interwar period, Ioan Lupa\u015f served in the Chamber of Deputies for several mandates, and as Minister of Health and Social Security in the Alexandru Averescu cabinet (1926\u20131927), as well as Minister of Culture and Arts in the Octavian Goga cabinet (1937 \u2013 1938). Due to his political activity, he was arrested by the communist regime on 5 May 1950 and detained at Sighet prison until 5 May 1955. Lupa\u0219 died on 3 July 1867 and he was buried at the Cernica Monastery. ==Works== *C\u00e2teva pagini din trecutul comunei S\u0103li\u015fte *Schi\u0163\u0103 istoric\u0103, Sibiu, 1903 *\u015eovinismul confesional \u00een istoriografia rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 ardelean\u0103.
