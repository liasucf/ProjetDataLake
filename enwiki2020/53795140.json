Established in 2016, it is dedicated to the Turkish War of Independence. The museum was established by the Metropolitan Municipality of Eski\u015fehr, and was inaugurated on October 29, 2016, 93rd anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic. The museum is situated in the historic Mestano\u011flu Halil Mansion, which was restored for this purpose in a project of June 2015. The fact that \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, commander of the Turkish troops during the First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc (1921), stayed in the mansion, was key to the selection of the site. The museum blends information and documents with the help of contemporary technology. At ground floor, a section is reserved for use by children. By using touchscreens, events of the Turkish War of Independence (1919\u20131923) and Conference of Lausanne (1922\u20131923) are explained. Moreover, children can entertain with computer games found in four rooms at the upper floor, as \"War of Independence with Cartoons\", \"War of Independence with Newspapers\", \"Strategy Room\" and \"Presentation Room\". In the \"Cartoons Room\", cartoons in humor magazines published between 1919\u20131923 are on display that depict the Allies occupying Istanbul, the Ottoman Government of Ahmet Tevfik Pasha, people and corporations opposing the War of Independence. In the \"Strategy Room\", the First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc is depicted. The room contains also wax sculptures of \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, Fahrettin Altay and Mehmetchik. In the \"Presentation Room\", visual objects depicting the War of Independence are on display in chronological order. One room in the ground floor serves to the visitors as a place for taking selfie in front of the photos of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk or War of Independence. ==References== Category:Museums in Eski\u015fehir Category:History museums in Turkey Category:Turkish War of Independence Category:Museums established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in Turkey Category:Odunpazar\u0131 ",
