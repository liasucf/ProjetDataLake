The southern muriqui, B. arachnoides, has a solid black face, distinguishing it from the northern species, B. hypoxanthus, which has a black face mottled with pink. Southern muriqui are frugivores, which means that fruit is the preferred food type. They have been claimed to possess the most diverse fruit diet in the Atlantic, and also consume leaves and flowers.

Ecology, 98(6), 1729\u20131729. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1818/suppinfo This species is considered endangered because of habitat destruction, hunting pressures, and historic population declines. Only two captive populations of the southern muriqui exist. They are housed at the zoos of Curitiba and Sorocaba. The latter is located 80 km from the only long-term investigation of the southern muriqui in continuous forest, the Carlos Botelho State Park. The wild population was estimated at 1,300 in 2005. ==References== ==External links== *Pr\u00f3-Muriqui Association \u2013 Conservation Research of southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides) * Conservation of the Muriqui from Brazil southern muriqui Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Primates of South America Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Forest (biome) southern muriqui ",
