The monument in question may not have been intended to represent a bear. It is classed as a Verraco, a type of prehistoric monument found in central Spain, which shares its name with the Spanish word for a boar. Local legend identifies this example as a bear. == External links == * \u2014 Web Official www.ElOso.es Category:Municipalities in the Province of \u00c1vila Category:Megalithic monuments in Spain ",
