    "text": "Dot N Pro (sometimes Dot & Pro), are an American record production duo from New York City, New York consisting of S. Dot and Pro, also known as APro and Pro Da Genius. They have produced for artists including Diddy, Jeremih, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Mack Maine, and DMX. They have been named the best production duo since The Neptunes. Before they got together, they produced on different mixtapes separately, but this caused them to compete as to who had the best beats. For instance, they both produced most of the songs on Cory Gunz' mixtapes Best Kept Secret and Youngest In Charge. They tired of competing, and decided to join forces and collaborate. They then realized that their beats sounded much better together than apart. In 2011, they appeared on Cory Gunz' MTV docu-series, Son of a Gun. They also produced the theme song for the show and musically directed the live series finale. ==Production credits== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+As Dot N Pro ! Song !! Year !! Artist(s) !!
