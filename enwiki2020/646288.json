Outer Manchuria (; ) is a term for a territory in Northeast Asia that is part of Russia and had formerly belonged to the Qing dynasty. Russia annexed this territory by way of the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Treaty of Peking in 1860. The northern part of the area was in dispute between 1643 and 1689. ==History of the term== ==Place names== ==History== The northeastern Qing Empire on a French map from 1734. ==Disputes== Outstanding boundary issues between China and Russia have been officially settled. Article 6 of the 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship provides that the contracting parties\u2014the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation\u2014have no territorial claims. As the Republic of China, now based in Taiwan, has never recognized the People's Republic of China or its border treaties with other countries, some maps published in Taiwan still consider the entire Heixiazi Island and the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River to be Chinese territories. However, these maps show Outer Manchuria, sometimes called \"lost territories in the Northeast\" (), to be Russian territory. == See also == * 1991 Sino-Russian Border Agreement * Hulun * Inner Manchuria * Outer Mongolia * Tannu Uriankhai * Outer Northwest China * Sixty-Four Villages East of the River * Blagoveshchensk massacre and Sixty-Four Villages East of the River massacre * Amur Annexation == Notes == == References == * ==External links== * Books.google.com: Russia in Manchuria \u2014 1903 illustrated article. * Category:East Asia Category:Inner Asia Category:Geography of Northeast Asia Category:Geography of the Russian Far East Category:Historical regions of China Category:Historical regions in Russia Category:History of Manchuria Category:China\u2013Russian Empire relations Category:China\u2013Russia relations ",
