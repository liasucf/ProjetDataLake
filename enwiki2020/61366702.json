He is married to Eona, a Singaporean, and the couple have two children named Jeslyn and Eli. ==Political activity== ===2017 general election=== During the lead-up to the 2017 general election, Elliott Ikilei had been designated as the Conservative candidate for a cross-party debate in March 2017 organised by the University of Auckland's Debating Society. However, the Conservatives were uninvited when the society decided to limit participants to parties that were represented in the New Zealand Parliament. At a subsequent debate held at the University of Auckland, Ikilei advocated a pro-life stance on abortion and supported citizen-initiated referendums. In June 2017, Ikilei was appointed as the Conservative Party's deputy leader and nominated as the party's candidate for the Manurewa electorate. In the 2017 election, the Manurewa seat was won by Labour Party Member of Parliament Louisa Wall; Ikilei won only 342 votes. The Conservatives overall performed poorly during the election, winning only 0.2% of the party vote (6,253 votes) and did not win a seat in Parliament. ===Post-2017 election=== After the Conservatives rebranded themselves as the New Conservatives, Ikilei defended controversial far-right Canadians Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux, who had been denied public speaking venues during their tour of Auckland in July 2018. In August 2018, Ikilei seconded former National and ACT parties leader Don Brash during a debate on free speech and \"political correctness\" at the University of Auckland, which attracted the attention of protesters. In October 2018, Ikilei was designated as the party's candidate for the scheduled Botany by-election, triggered by Jami-Lee Ross resigning from the National Party. However, the by-election did not go ahead since Ross opted to remain in Parliament as an independent candidate. === 2020 general election === In April 2020, the party announced Ikilei as their candidate for the new electorate of Takanini (at the time proposed to be called \"Flat Bush\") that had been created following population changes. He has campaigned on increasing support for neighbourhood police teams in Takanini and improving local road infrastructure. During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Ikilei attended an anti-lockdown \"liberty march\" in Auckland's Queen Street, which attracted hundreds of demonstrators including Advance New Zealand party co-leader Jami-Lee Ross. ==Political views== Ikilei is socially conservative, taking a traditional stance on abortion, the family, law and order, welfare and transgender issues. In April 2019, Ikilei was temporarily suspended from Twitter for tweeting \"'Trans women' are men with dysphoria/disorder, to be treated with compassion and tolerance\"; a remark which many regarded as transphobic. Ikilei has defended controversial Australian rugby player Israel Folau's opposition to homosexuality. Ikilei has described free speech as a cornerstone of Western culture. He has also advocated tough on crime policies and opposed so-called \"race-based\" policies including M\u0101ori seats. In August 2019, Ikilei welcomed a deal between the M\u0101ori tribe Te Kawerau \u0101 Maki and Fletcher Building over the Ihum\u0101tao land dispute. He has also criticised China's Hong Kong national security law. ==References== ==External links== *New Conservatives profile *Elliot Ikilei's LinkedIn profile Category:Living people Category:New Conservative Party (New Zealand) politicians Category:New Zealand Christians Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 2017 New Zealand general election Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Candidates in the 2020 New Zealand general election ",
