He was convicted again for his involvement with the theft and sale of Edvard Munch's Madonna in 1992, and sentenced to seven months in prison. Bach managed to establish new connections, most importantly with Gerard Cok. Cok controlled the German porn enterprise Beate Uhse, and he trusted Bach with the establishment of porn shops in Norway and Sweden.\"Dette var Ole Christian Bach\", Per Valebrok in VG 12.7.2005 With security in an estate out of Oslo, Cok also gave Bach a NOK 60.000.000 loan.
