The morphological classification places it midway on the continuum between a barred spiral (SB) and an unbarred spiral (SA), with an inner region that lies between a ring-like (r) and a purely spiral form (s), and medium- (b) to loosely wound (c) outer spiral arms. This makes it a hybrid ringed, barred spiral galaxy. It has an angular size of and the estimated mass M is given log M = 9.76, yielding solar masses. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Intermediate spiral galaxies 4444 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1836 Category:Centaurus (constellation) ",
