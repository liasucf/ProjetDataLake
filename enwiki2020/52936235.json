He is the writer of an English-language blog, The Sudanese Thinker. ==Early life and education== Born in Khartoum, Nasr was raised in Qatar and Malaysia. Raised by parents who were not particularly pious Muslims, he began his education at Islamic schools in Qatar and Kuala Lumpur, where the focus was on memorizing the Koran. He learned \u201cthat Jews drink the blood of children and conspire against Islam\u201d and was taught \u201cprayers calling for the destruction of the Jews.\u201d He also learned English. Nasr became more and more devout as a result of his teachers' influence, but later, as a teenager in Kuala Lumpur, he encountered young liberal-minded Muslims online and in person and began to question his faith. He started his own blog, on which he recorded his shifting religious views. He is currently pursuing a master\u2019s in philosophy and researching the effect of new media on Islamic thought today. ==Career== Nasr began writing his blog in 2006 because he felt that not enough Sudanese citizens were speaking out about Darfur. His blog helped encourage other people in Sudan to start English-language blogs. It also became a significance source of information for foreign journalists and audiences. Originally, Nasr's blog was anonymous, but in 2011, during the Arab Spring, he revealed his identity. Since then he has become an author, activist, social entrepreneur, and human-rights advocate. ===My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind \u2013 And Doubt Freed My Soul=== In 2013, he published his first book, My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind\u2014And Doubt Freed My Soul. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised the book for \u201cseamlessly blend[ing] memoir with political thought and activism.\u201d Author Clay Shirky has described the book as \u201ca love letter to freedom of speech.\u201d Another author, Ken Wilber, called it \u201can important and significant book.\u201d ===Other writings=== In a June 2011 article for the Guardian, he wrote that the secession of what is now South Sudan would not end Sudan's \u201cAfro-Arab identity crisis\u201d or \u201cmagically turn the country into a genuinely Arab Islamic nation-state despite what Omar al-Bashir may want.\u201d On the contrary, he wrote, \u201cSudan always has been and always will be a multi-ethnic, multi-religious melting pot.\u201d In January 2012, he wrote an article for Al Jazeera, titled \"Reviving the \"New Sudan vision. The article is about John Garang, the Southern Sudanese Christian rebel turned-statesmen. In June 2012, he wrote an article for Foreign Policy entitled \u201cSudan Needs a Revolution.\u201d He suggested that the tide was \u201cshifting against Bashir,\u201d and that \u201cmost Sudanese citizens aren\u2019t yearning for more Islamism, but are instead focusing on and demanding better economic conditions, transparency, and accountability.\u201d While \u201cthis battle will ultimately be fought and won by Sudanese, the international community also has an important role to play.\u201d ===Other professional activities=== Nasr is a contributor to Global Voices Online. He organized The Future of Islam In the Age of New Media, an online audio seminar featuring 60 speakers.
