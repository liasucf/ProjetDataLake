    "text": "The Woodland Trust is leading 70 organizations in the call for a Charter for Trees, Woods and People. == History == The Charter of the Forest was first signed on 6 November 1217 as a sister charter to the Magna Carta from which it had evolved. Some minor changes were made to it, before it was reissued in 1225. It was then joined with Magna Carta in the Confirmation of Charters in 1297. A Charter of the Forest was signed by Henry III to set down rights for people to access the sustainable benefits of the woods, trees and grazing lands of the Royal Forests in England. It provides a window to a period of history when trees and woods were integral to everyday life for firewood, building material and food. In October 2010, the government introduced the Public Bodies Bill to The House of Lords, which would have enabled the Secretary of State to sell or lease public forests in England. The Woodland Trust believed that the public outcry that stopped those plans in its tracks revealed the connection people feel to the woods and trees of the UK, a connection that is rarely visible. The Independent Panel on Forestry wrote in its 2011 Report > A Charter should be created for the English Public Forest Estate, to be > renewed every ten years. The Charter should specify the public benefit > mission and statutory duties. The new Charter for Trees, Woods and People was launched on 6 November 2017 on the 800th anniversary of the Charter of the Forest. The Tree Charter address different issues to the historic charter because society and priorities have changed so much. However, there has been no comparable statement of rights and responsibilities in the intervening 800 years. The Tree Charter aims to bring this discussion of the importance of woods and trees to people back to the forefront of public consciousness. == Aims == The call to create a Charter for Trees, Woods and People was first launched in January 2016 The purpose of the Tree Charter: The charter aims to join the dots between all the different areas of society in which trees give benefits so that it can recognize and protect the true value of trees to society. Organizations involved are from a variety of industries. This includes commercial forestry, health, wildlife conservation and many more. Creating the Tree Charter: To create this Tree Charter, thousands of tree \u2018stories\u2019 were collected from people across the UK about what trees and woods mean to them. A tree story is any expression of what trees and woods mean to people. They can be a sentence or longer phrase, a photo, audio clip or video. The tree stories were collected until the end of February 2017. These tree stories collected from the UK public, along with specific consultations with forestry and sector professionals, will form the basis for the partner organizations to write the content of the final Tree Charter. The new Tree Charter document will not be legally binding, but more a set of guiding principles, to which politicians, organizations, community groups and individuals can be held to account. The 10 Tree Charter Principles were announced on 27 March 2017. From this moment onwards, the public is being asked to sign to show support for the Tree Charter. == Purpose == The Tree Charter will be a document which can be used to hold politicians, community groups and organizations to account, backed up by the body of evidence of over 60,000 public stories. It will be the basis each year of a joint statement from the partner organizations, which will demonstrate whether or not the aims of the Charter have been achieved. == Organizations involved == Partner organizations involved in creating the Tree Charter. * Action for Conservation * Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association UK * Ancient Tree Forum * Arboricultural Association * Bat Conservation Trust * Black Environment Network * Borders Forest Trust * British Association for Shooting and Conservation * Butterfly Conservation * Campaign for National Parks (CNP) * Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) * Caring For God's Acre * Centre for Sustainable Healthcare * Church of England * CIEEM (Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management) * City of Trees * Climate Coalition * Coigach Assynt Trust * Common Ground * Confor * Confederation of Timber Industries (CTI) * Continuous Cover Forestry Group * Country Land and Business Association (CLA) * Forest School Association (FSA) * Froglife * FSC-UK (Forest Stewardship Council) * Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust * Going Wild * GreenBlue Urban * GroundWork Gallery * Grown in Britain * Institute of Chartered Foresters (ICF) * John Muir Trust * Legal Sustainability Alliance (LSA) * Llais y Goedwig * MADE (Muslim Action for Development and Environment) * Mersey Forest * National Association of Local Councils * National Forest * National Trust * National Union of Students (NUS) * New Forest National Park Authority * National Farmers' Union (NFU) * Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action * Northern Ireland Environment Link * Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids * Plantlife * Reforesting Scotland * RFS (Royal Forestry Society) * RHS (Royal Horticultural Society) * Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh * RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) * RSPB Wales * Small Woods Association * Soil Association * SWOG (Small Woodland Owners' Group) * Sylva Foundation * TDAG (Trees and Design Action Group) * The British Beekeepers Association * The British Druid Order * The Conservation Foundation * The Conservation Volunteers (TCV) * The Consulting Arborist Society (CAS) * The Land Trust * The Landscape Institute * The Orchard Project * The Pagan Federation * The Sherwood Forest Trust * The Tree Council * The Wildlife Trusts * The Windsor Estate * Timber Trade Federation (TTF) * Tir Coed * Trees for Cities * Wild Network * Wildlife & Countryside Link * Woodland Heritage * Woodland Trust * Woodlands.co.uk * WWF-UK ==References== ==External links== * Category:Trees Category:Organizations established in 2016 ",
