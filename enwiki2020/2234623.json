    "text": "Asylum is the 13th studio album by the American rock band Kiss, released on September 16, 1985. The album marked a continuation of the glam metal sound of preceding album Animalize. ==Recording== Asylum is the first album to feature lead guitarist Bruce Kulick as an official band member. Kulick had replaced former guitarist Mark St. John on some tracks on the previous album Animalize (1984) during the latter's absence due to reactive arthritis. Subsequently, Kulick filled St. John's spot during most segments of the Animalize tour. This new lineup of Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Carr, and Kulick would last until Carr's death in November 1991, while Kulick would stay with the band until the reunion of the original lineup in 1996. ==Cover== The album cover depicts the four band members with colored lips, mirroring the colors of the 1978 solo releases: red for Simmons, purple for Stanley, blue for Kulick (replacing Frehley) and green for Carr (replacing Peter Criss). The artwork for the back cover is similarly stylised and colourful, depicting Kiss against a white background. The cover art of the remastered 1997 CD release of Asylum featured slightly altered, bolder colours than that of the original release. ==Live performances== The supporting Asylum Tour ran throughout North America from November 1985 to April 1986. The tour featured the largest light-up Kiss logo the band has ever used, as well as one of the largest lighting rigs. No concert footage of the tour was used in the Kissology II DVD release, except for short clips without sound in the background of the main menu. \"Tears Are Falling\" is the only song on the album that has been played regularly in live performances beyond the Asylum Tour. However, like many Kiss songs of the mid-1980s, the track was rarely played live after the 1996 reunion of the original Kiss lineup, although it did feature in both 2004's Rock the Nation Live! DVD and 2014's Kiss Rocks Vegas live release. ==Singles== \"Tears Are Falling\" was the only track to be released for retail sales as a single and was a hit for the band, with the video in particular proving popular on MTV. A total of three music videos for the album were filmed on set in London, England, for the songs \"Who Wants to Be Lonely\", \"Uh! All Night\" and \"Tears Are Falling\" respectively. ==Reception== The album was certified Gold in November, 1985 by the RIAA, although it has long been rumored to be nearing the platinum level of sales. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Kiss *Paul Stanley \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals, bass guitar on \"Tears Are Falling\" *Gene Simmons \u2013 bass guitar, vocals *Eric Carr \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals *Bruce Kulick \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals Additional musicians *Jean Beauvoir \u2013 bass guitar and backing vocals on \"Who Wants to Be Lonely\" and \"Uh!
