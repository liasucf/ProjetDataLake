    "text": "In the United States, the first full week of September is designated National Blood Donation Week. Established in 2016, the week unites states to hold individual state blood donation days. This serves to assist blood banks all over the country to keep their shelves full and to raise awareness of the continual need to donate blood and blood products. The final day of the week holds most of the states' blood donation days, and is known as National Blood Donation Day. ==Background== 2016 was plagued with massive reports of blood bank supply shortages. The Zika epidemic was beginning, causing many who donated blood routinely to abstain from donating for at least a month. 36,000 units of blood are needed each day in the U.S. With mass casualties that occurred during the summer, including the Orlando nightclub shooting and the Dallas officer shooting, a united campaign was necessary to increase the nation's blood supply. Syndicated radio host and physician Dr. Daliah Wachs had created Nevada Blood Donation Day in 2015 in response to local blood shortages, and partnered with United Blood Services and the American Red Cross, to create a state day, proclaimed by Governor Brian Sandoval. She vowed to help expand this nationally, and in 2016 she created this campaign with United Blood Services, American Red Cross and blood banks throughout the country.
