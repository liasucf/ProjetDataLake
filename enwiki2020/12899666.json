Members of this genus and of some other genera in Caryophyllaceae are commonly called sandworts.They are found only in the north temperate zone. The genus Moehringia was first formally named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It is named after Paul M\u00f6hring (1710\u20131791). Its type species is Moehringia muscosa.Index Nominum Genericorum (see External links below) By 1992, there were 31 recognized species.Simone Fior and Per Ola Karis. 2007. \"Phylogeny, evolution, and systematics of Moehringia (Caryophyllaceae) as inferred from molecular and morphological data: a case of homology reassessment.\" Cladistics 23(4):362-372. In 2007, Fior and Karis transferred four species from Moehringia to Arenaria, leaving Moehringia with 27 species. M. fontqueri, M. intricata, M. tejedensis, and M. glochidisperma were renamed A. funiculata, A. suffruticosa, A. tejedensis, and A. glochidisperma, respectively. ==Species== Species include: * Moehringia lateriflora * Moehringia macrophylla * Moehringia muscosa * Moehringia trinervia * Moehringia villosa * 22 more ==References== Category:Caryophyllaceae genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
