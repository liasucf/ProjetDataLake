It was Andy Friend's first season in charge of the side. In the regular season, Connacht were in Conference A of the Pro14. The team finished third in their conference, qualifying for the play-offs for the first time since the 2015\u201316 season where they were beaten by Ulster in the quarter-final. As well as playing in the Pro14, the team competed in the Challenge Cup in Europe. They qualified as one of the best runners up from a pool including Bordeaux, Perpignan and Sale Sharks to reach the quarter- finals, where they again met Sale. A 20\u201310 defeat saw the team eliminated in the last eight. In addition to the league and European competitions, the Connacht Eagles development side competed in two new competitions. The first was the Celtic Cup, which saw them play against other Irish provinces' development teams and sides from Wales. The Eagles finished bottom of the Irish conference the inaugural edition of this tournament. The second competition was the Cara Cup, which involved the Irish provinces and the New England Free Jacks, a newly established Major League Rugby side. The Eagles won both of their games, beating Ulster and the Free Jacks. ==Background== Following the removal of head coach Kieran Keane one year into a three-year deal, Andy Friend was hired as his replacement. The team also had a new captain for the season, following the retirement of John Muldoon, the province's most-capped player. In August 2018, Jarrad Butler was named as his replacement. ==Coaching and management team== Note: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules.
