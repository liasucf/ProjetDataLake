    "text": "The Asii, Osii, Ossii, Asoi, Asioi, Asini or Aseni were an ancient Indo- European people of Central Asia, during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. Known only from Classical Greek and Roman sources, they were one of the peoples held to be responsible for the downfall of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. In Greek Mythology they were the children of Iapetus and Asia. Modern scholars have attempted to identify the Asii with other peoples known from European and Chinese sources including the: Yuezhi, Tocharians, Issedones/Wusun and/or Alans. ==Historical sources== The classical European sources relating to the Asii are brief. They sometimes survive only as quotations in other ancient sources, with textual variations that have led to widely varying translations and interpretations. During the 4th and 3rd Centuries BCE, Megasthenes, who lived in Arachosia and was an ambassador to the Mauryan court in Pataliputra, refers in his work Indika to three tribes with similar and possibly related names, in separate parts of South Asia: * the Aseni had three cities and their capital was the Bucephala (where Alexander the Great had buried his horse by the same name), the site of which is a matter of controversy;Archaeological Reconnaissances in North-western India and South-eastern \u012ar\u0101n, pp. 31\u201332 and n. 15. Aurel Stein. (1937). Macmillan and Co., London. * the Osii were near neighbours of the Taxillae in the Indus Valley, and; * the Asoi lived on plains known as Amanda (probably Gandhara), alongside tribes such as the Peucolaitae (Pushkalavati) and Geretae (Panjkorans). These references by Megasthenes have survived only as citations in other texts. In the 1st century BCE, Trogus names \u2013 in the Historiae Philppicae (of which only the \"Prologues\" have survived intact) \u2013 three tribes involved in the conquest of Bactria: the Asiani, Sacaraucae and Tochari (i.e. the Tukhara of Bactria rather than the so-called Tocharians of the Tarim Basin). The Tochari are reported to have, at some point, become subject to the ruling elite of the Asiani. According to Trogus, the Sacaraucae had since been destroyed. (In about 200 CE, the Roman historian, Justin (Marcus Junianus Justinus), wrote an epitome or condensation of Trogus's history. The last datable event recorded by Justin is the recovery of the Roman standards captured by the Parthians in 20 BCE, although Trogus' original history may have dealt with events into the first decade of the 1st century CE.) Strabo completed his Geography in 23 CE. He mentions four tribes: the Asioi, Pasianoi, Sakaraulai, and Tokharoi. Pliny the Elder, in about 77\u201379 CE, makes a brief mention of a people called the Asini in his Naturalis Historia. According to P. H. L. Eggermont: > Pliny mentions ... the Asini, who are reigning in the city of Bucephela. > From these three data, 1) the Tacoraei are neighbours of the > Besadae/Sosaeadae; 2) the Asini are the neighbours of the Sosaeadae > [possibly the Kirata]; [and] 3) The Asiani are kings of the Thocari, it > follows that the Asini of Pliny's text are identical with the Asiani, who > are the kings of the Tocharians. This implies that\u2014at least in the time of > Pliny\u2014the Kush\u0101\u1e47as were kings of the region between Jhelam and Indus and > that Bucephala was one of their cities. It seems that Pliny availed himself > of a recent description of this territory and that Ptolemy knew these data > too.The Murundas and the ancient trade-route from Taxila to Ujjain.\" P. H. > L. Eggermont. Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 9 > (1966), p. 283. ==Possible links to other peoples== Many theories have been proposed by historians and other scholars as to their origins, relationships, language, culture, etc., but so far no consensus has emerged. It is generally accepted that the Asiani mentioned by Trogus were probably identical to the Asii of Strabo.Iaroslav Lebedynsky. (2006). Les Saces: Les \u00abScythes\u00bb d'Asie, VIIIe si\u00e8cle av. J.-C. \u2014 IVe si\u00e8cle apr. J.-C. Editions Errance, Paris. There is no agreement over whether another tribe mentioned by Strabo, the \"Pasiani\" were likewise related. Scholars such as W. W. Tarn, Moti Chandra believe that \"as Asiani is the (Iranian) adjectival form of Asii, so Pasiani would be the similar adjectival form of, and would imply, a name such as *Pasii or *Pasi\".Seleucid-Parthian Studies, 1930, p 11; The Greeks in Bactria & India, 1938, p 292, William Woodthorpe TarnTrade and Trade Routes in Ancient India, 1977, p 94, Moti Chandra; Geographical and Economic Studies in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata: Up\u0101yana Parva, 1945, p 17, Moti Chandra.Proceedings of the British Academy, 1930, p 113, British Academy, Balasundara Gupta; Literary History of Ancient India in Relation to Its Racial and Linguistic Affiliations, 1953, p 148, Chandra Chakraberty \u2013 Sanskrit literature. This may suggest that Strabo was referring to a group of Persians (Old Persian P\u0101rsa) or Parsis who had settled in Central Asia. However, scholars such as J. Marquart believe that they were synonymous with the Asiani.Goeg., XI, 8, 2, Von Gutschmid. In other words, the Asii and the Pasiani were one and the same, and \"Pasiani\" was a misspelling of Asiani, or a variant of the same name. Others suggest that the name is a misspelling of Gasiani,\"The Y\u00fceh-chih and their migrations.\" K. Enoki, G. A. Koshelenko and Z. Haidary.

Alfred von Gutschmid believed that Asii, Pasiani and other names mentioned by Strabo are an attempt to render Yuezhi in Greek.Goeg., XI, 8, 2, Alfred von Gutschmid. W. W. Tarn first thought that the Asii were probably one part of the Yuezhi, the other being the Tocharians. However, he later expressed doubts as to this position.W. W. Tarn. The Greeks in Bactria and India. 2nd edition. (1951), pp. 284, 286, 533. Cambridge.Taishan Yu. A Study of Saka History, p. 40, n. 30. (1998) Sino-Platonic Papers. University of Pennsylvania. By the middle of the 1st Millennium CE, speakers of the so-called Tocharian A language in the Tarim Basin, apparently referred to themselves as \u0100r\u015bi (pronounced \"arshi\"; apparently meaning \"shining\" or \"brilliant\"). ===Issedones/Wusun=== Asii or Asiani may simply be a corruption of the name of the Issedones \u2013 an Iranian people mentioned by Herodotus \u2013 who are frequently identified with the Wusun mentioned in contemporaneous Chinese sources. Taishan Yu proposes that Asii were \"probably\" the dominant tribe of a confederacy of four Issedonean tribes \"from the time that they had settled in the valleys of the Ili and Chu\" who later invaded Sogdiana and Bactria. \"This would account for their being called collectively \"Issedones\" by Herodotus.\" He also states that the \"Issedon Scythia and the Issedon Serica took their names from the Issedones.\"Taishan Yu. A Study of Saka History, pp. 12, 15, 24, 140. (1998) Sino-Platonic Papers. University of Pennsylvania. Yu believes that the Issedones must have migrated to the Ili and Chu valleys, \"at the latest towards the end of the 7th century B.C.\"Taishan Yu.

Thames & Hudson Ltd., New York and London. . === The Alans === A rival theory instead identifies the Asii/Asiani/Asioi with the Alans, an Iranian tribe who migrated from the Eurasian Steppe into Europe during the early Middle Ages. There is circumstantial evidence for such a link in: * the name of the Aorsi, who migrated from Central Asia during the late 5th century BCE, to areas north and west of the Caspian Sea, and;Richard Brzezinski & M. Mielczarek, 2002, The Sarmatians, 600 BC - AD 450, Oxford, Osprey Military, pp. 7\u20138, 92. * a state known to 2nd and 1st century BCE Chinese scholars as Yancai and Alanliao,Y. A. Zadneprovskiy, 1994, \"The Nomads of Northern Central Asia After The Invasion of Alexander\", in J\u00e1nos Harmatta, History of Civilizations of Central Asia: the Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations, 700 B. C. to A. D. 250, Paris, UNESCO, pp. 457\u2013472. which was located north of the Aral Sea. The Alans were first documented by European scholars during the 1st century CE, on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. Onomastic evidence for the identification of the Asii and Alans is provided by later medieval European scholars and travellers. In the 13th century, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (Johannes de Plano Carpini) referred to Alani sive Assi (\"Alans or Assi\") and William of Rubrouck used the name Alani sive Aas (\"Alans or Aas\"). In the 15th century, Josephus Barbarus reported that the Alans referred to themselves by the name As.F. Thordarson, 1987\u20132011, \"Asii\", Encyclopedia Iranica (12 March 2017) The name of the Ossetians, who are descended from the Alans, also has its root in the alternate ethnonym Osi. However, names similar to Alan (e.g. Aryan and Iron) were clearly used by distantly-related Iranian tribes in very different historical contexts and the identification of the Alans with the Asii requires them to have migrated more than 2,800 kilometres (1,750 miles) in the space of several decades. According to archaeologist Claude Rapin, it is unlikely that the Asii of Bactria migrated further west than Kangju/Sogdia.Rapin, Claude (2007). \"Nomads and the Shaping of Central Asia.\" In: After Alexander: Central Asia before Islam.
