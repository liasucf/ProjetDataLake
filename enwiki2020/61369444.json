    "text": "War in My Mind is the ninth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Beth Hart, released on September 27, 2019. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo. Hart will tour the UK and Ireland in support of the album in 2020. ==Background== In the album announcement, Hart commented: \"More than any record I've ever made, I'm more open to being myself on these songs [...] On this record, something told me, 'Just let it be what it is.' I think I'm starting to make a little headway, getting closer to the truth. And I might not know what the truth is... but I'm OK with that.\" ==Critical reception== Writing for American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz called it \"arguably [Hart's] most intimate and intense set yet\", further commenting that \"Her dynamic, classically influenced piano propels most songs including the ballads, such as the title track, that dominate this set. [...] There's no denying the truth, integrity and gritty realism that infuses everything Beth Hart touches.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 64 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Beth Hart albums ",
