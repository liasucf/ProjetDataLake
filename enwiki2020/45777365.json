For many years she was the assistant of Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, leader of the Spanish Communist Party, and she is best known for this role. After the Spanish Civil War she was forced into exile in Moscow and Beijing. She returned to Spain after the return to democracy in 1977. ==Early years== Irene Lewy Rodr\u00edguez was born in Madrid on 27 November 1907, the second of three sisters. Her father was Siegried Levy Herzberg, a middle-class Polish Jew. Her father died when she was five, and to survive her mother rented rooms in their house in the Calle de Trafalgar. Irene was educated at the German College and learned four languages. She obtained a position as a librarian for Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal (1852\u20131934). He was a biologist who won the Nobel Prize. C\u00e9sar Falc\u00f3n (1892\u20131970), Irene Falc\u00f3n's husband In 1922 Irene Lewy met the Peruvian journalist C\u00e9sar Falc\u00f3n (1892\u20131970), and fell in love. Two years later the newspaper El Sol asked Falc\u00f3n to move to London as a correspondent. They married, and Irene accompanied him. She was contracted as correspondent by the daily La Voz (The Voice), a Spanish newspaper. Their son Mayo was born in London in May 1926 but was not registered at the Spanish consulate due to concerns with the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. Irene and C\u00e9sar returned to Spain after Primo de Rivera fell in 1930. The Falc\u00f3ns published Historia Nueva (New History) and launched the party Izquierda Revolucionaria y Antiimperialista (IRYA: Anti-Imperialist Revolutionary Left). Irene founded the feminist organization Mujeres Antifascistas (Anti-Fascist Women). She edited a collection of books by women, the best feminist literature of the time, including work by Doris Langley Moore, Vera Inber and Dora Russell, wife of Bertrand Russell, whom Irene had met in London. Irene wrote in the preface to Dora Russell's Hypatia, ==Communist activist== Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri in 1936 The Falc\u00f3ns joined the Spanish Communist Party in 1932, when IRYA merged into that party. There Irene met Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, known as Pasionaria. They lost their jobs with the newspapers, and lived in poverty in a slum in Madrid. They formed the Teatro Proletario, a theater group. This group, also called Nosotros (\"Us\"), was formed in 1933 and performed work by Maxim Gorky and the classic anti-war drama Hinkemann by Ernst Toller. In the summer of 1933 they visited Moscow with the Teatro Proletario group. The Soviet press reported in depth on their performances. The Spanish Committee of Women against War and Fascism, affiliated with the World Committee Against War and Fascism, was created with a committee controlled by the PCE. In August 1934 the Spanish committee sent a delegation to the World Congress of Women against War and Fascism in Paris. Ib\u00e1rruri led the group, which included two Republicans and two Communists, Encarnaci\u00f3n Fuyola and Irene Falc\u00f3n. The Spanish committee was dissolved in October 1934 during the repression that followed the Asturian miners' strike. In 1934 Irene went to Moscow as correspondent of Mundo Obrero (Worker's World), the PCE newspaper. She returned to Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) to help Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, and became her close colleague and friend until Ib\u00e1rruri's death in November 1989. She used the pseudonym \"Toboso\". Early in March 1939 she helped arrange the evacuation of senior party members from Spain. Ib\u00e1rruri left for Oran on 6 March 1939. ==Exile== Irene Falc\u00f3n went into exile with Ib\u00e1rruri in Paris and then the USSR. There she worked for the underground Radio Pirenaica. The Falc\u00f3ns' marriage broke down because C\u00e9sar Falc\u00f3n could not remain faithful. During World War II (1939\u201345) Irene and C\u00e9sar Falc\u00f3n were separated, and after the war C\u00e9sar returned to Peru. Irene Falc\u00f3n remained a feminist within the Communist mold. Writing in the Communist magazine Nuestra Bandera in August 1946 Falcon called for women to continue to play their traditional nurturing role, but to also participate in the struggle against Fascism. She wrote, \"Precisely in the clandestine resistance, women can play and are playing an extremely important role. On the one hand, women who have already played an active part in workers or mass organizations are an important support to their partners and children who choose the heroic path of resistance, the one that helps the guerrilla movements.\" In August 1946 Falcon became national secretary of the Union of Spanish Women. After the Prague show trial of 1952 eleven Czechoslovakian Communists were executed, including Falc\u00f3n's former lover Bed\u0159ich Geminder, head of the Czech Communist Party's central committee's Department of International Relations. Although her relationship with Geminder had ended in 1945 Falc\u00f3n was thrown out of the party. She became a persona non grata and lost her job at Radio Pirenaica. She and her sister Kety were banned from working, and her son Mayo was banned from the Soviet Communist Party. Ib\u00e1rruri managed to get her another job, working discreetly to avoid herself getting into trouble. In 1954 Irene Falc\u00f3n went to Beijing to launch a radio station in Castilian. After a year and a half she returned to the USSR. Irene Falc\u00f3n returned to Spain from exile in 1977 after the return of democracy. She became director of the Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri Foundation. In 1996 she published her memoirs entitled Asaltar los cielos. Mi vida junto a Pasionaria (Storm the Skies: My Life with Pasionaria). She died on 19 August 1999 in El Espinar, Segovia, from a respiratory condition. ==Works== * * ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1907 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Spanish communists Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in the Soviet Union Category:Socialist feminists ",
