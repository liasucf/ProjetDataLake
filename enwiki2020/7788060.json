    "text": "Arion is a genus of air-breathing land slugs in the family Arionidae, the roundback slugs. Most species of this Palearctic genus are native to the Iberian Peninsula.Quinteiro, J., et al. (2005). Phylogeny of slug species of the genus Arion: evidence of monophyly of Iberian endemics and of the existence of relict species in Pyrenean refuges. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 43(2), 139-48. Species can be difficult to distinguish from one another upon cursory examination, because individuals of a species can vary in color and there are few obvious differences between taxa.Skujien\u0117, G. and M. Soroka. (2003). A comparison of different DNA extraction methods for slugs (Mollusca: Pulmonata). Ekologija 1, 12-16. The color of an individual can be influenced by its diet.Jordaens, K., et al. (2001). Food-induced body pigmentation questions the taxonomic value of colour in the self-fertilizing slug Carinarion spp. Journal of Molluscan Studies 67(2), 161-67. Some Arion are known as pests, such as A. lusitanicus auct. non Mabille (= A. vulgaris), which damages agricultural crops and ornamental plants, and A. rufus, a familiar garden pest.Soroka, M., et al. (2008). Distribution and genetic diversity of the terrestrial slugs Arion lusitanicus Mabille, 1868 and Arion rufus (Linnaeus, 1758) in Poland based on mitochondrial DNA. Folia Biologica 57(1-2), 1-2. Arion slugs are often transported internationally in shipments of plant products and mushrooms.Barr, N. B., et al. (2009). Application of a DNA barcode using the 16S rRNA gene to diagnose pest Arion species in the USA. Journal of Molluscan Studies 75(2), 187-91. Arion slugs have been identified in North America and Australia as invasive species, altering the plants of ecosystems through seed predation and competing with native slugs. ==Species== There are approximately 40 species in the genus. Species include: * Arion ater - black slug * Arion circumscriptus - brownbanded arion * Arion distinctus Mabille, 1868 * Arion fasciatus * Arion flagellus * Arion fuscus * Arion hortensis F\u00e9russac, 1819 - small striped slug * Arion intermedius Normand, 1852 (syn.

Arion alpinus auctt. non Pollonera, 1887) * Arion occultus * Arion owenii * Arion rufus - red slug * Arion silvaticus * Arion simrothi * Arion subfuscus * Arion transsylvanus Simroth, 1885Jordaens, K., et al.
