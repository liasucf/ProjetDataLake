He was born in L\u00fcbeck on 22 September 1819 and died in Berlin on 17 January 1896.Daniel Christian Friedrich Kr\u00fcger in General German Biography (ADB ), Vol. 51, pp. 404\u2013408, publ. 1906 de.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=ADB:Kr\u00fcger,_Daniel_Christian_Friedrich&oldid;=2785518 Retrieved Feb 2018 ==Early life== Kr\u00fcger was the son of a L\u00fcbeck Senator. After attending the L\u00fcbeck Gymnasium, he studied jurisprudence at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen and completed his professional training by a long stay abroad, particularly Paris. In 1844, Kr\u00fcger became a lawyer in L\u00fcbeck and was appointed procurator in the lower court and the court of appeals. Kr\u00fcger's efficiency was fully acknowledged and in 1850 the city sent him as its representative to the Erfurt Union and the following year to the Elbe Ship Navigation commission in Magdeburg. After the introduction of the new constitution of L\u00fcbeck in 1849, he became the Spokesman of the B\u00fcrgerausschuss, the Committee of the House of Burgesses. ==Diplomatic service== In 1855 he became the Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic states at Copenhagen and conducted negotiations which resulted in the abolition of the Sound Dues, which had been a tax on L\u00fcbeck\u2019s trade out from the Baltic to the open sea. By the Copenhagen Convention in 1857 this source of revenue for Denmark was bought out by Great Britain, Russia, L\u00fcbeck and the other states trading in the Baltic. The railway connections between the three Hanseatic city states were of special interest to him. At his instigation, Denmark agreed to a direct railway line across its territory in Holstein from L\u00fcbeck to Hamburg. Already in Copenhagen, he had successfully represented Hamburg's interest in the construction of a railway connecting this town to Altona (in Holstein) and concluded an agreement with the Danish government in 1860. ==Hanseatic representative to the German Confederation== The Second Schleswig War of 1864 brought an end to Kr\u00fcger's activity in Copenhagen. He then took over the representation of the free cities in the Bundestag of the German Confederation at Frankfurt. On 14 June 1866 he addressed its last session, before the outbreak the Austro-Prussian War which ended that institution. At that time Schleswig and Holstein were a Prusso-Austrian condominium, with Prussia occupying the former and Austria the latter. On 8 June 1866 Prussian general Von Manteuffel crossed the river Eider into Holstein, having warned the Austrians that he was exercising Prussia\u2019s condominate right to establish garrisons in some unoccupied points of Holstein. Austria withdrew from Holstein, but invited the Bundestag to mobilise militarily against Prussia.Overthrow of the Germanic Confederation by Prussia in 1866, by Sir Alexander Malet, former British Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Frankfort; Publ. Longmans, London 1870; pp 181-184 All three Hanseatic cities, through their envoy Kr\u00fcger, voted against the Austrian proposal in the Bundestag on 14 June and jointly put a declaration formulated by L\u00fcbeck reasoning that the events in Holstein did not give rise to the mobilisation of the Confederation because the danger of an immediate collision was eliminated. However the proposal was carried. The L\u00fcbeck Senate sided with the Prussian view that the Confederation should no longer exist, because of the illegal action of mobilisation and proposed that their Bundestag envoy Kr\u00fcger be recalled. Carl Merck, foreign minister of Hamburg, wanted to wait and went to see the L\u00fcbeck Senate on 19 June to persuade them of this course.\u201cHamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890\u201d, by Hans-Georg Sch\u00f6nhoff, Publ. Hamburg, 1967; pp 13-17 On 21 June, the representatives of the Hanseatic cities met in Hamburg to discuss in detail measures which had been demanded by Prussia. The Prussian ambassador to the Hanseatic states, Emil von Richthofen, who also took part in this conference, emphasised that the abolition of all relations with Prussia's opponents was indispensable as a sign of friendly neutrality, and that therefore their Bundestag envoy in Frankfurt, Kr\u00fcger, must be recalled. The meeting agreed to recall Kr\u00fcger on 29 June. Richthofen now tried to persuade the Senate of Hamburg to give in to other demands, namely to send a military contingent to assist Prussia and to agree to a new close federation under Prussian hegemony. On 24 June, he visited two prominent members of the House of Burgesses (Burgerschaft), Isaac Wolffson (former President of the Burgerschaft and member of the Right party) and Johannes Halben (leader of the Left party), to inform them of the intended rejection of the Prussian proposals by the Senate. He pointed out that Prussia would not accept a refusal without further action. He mentioned that Prussia would dissolve the Senate and take over the government. The Burgerschaft would remain undisturbed, as would the population, if they kept quiet. Otherwise, 10,000 Prussian troops would occupy the city. Merck, to whom Wolffson and Halben had already reported this, sent Kr\u00fcger, who had been in Hamburg since 22 June, to Richthofen to obtain certainty about the Prussian threats. At the 26 June meeting of the Hamburg Senate, Merck said that to avoid occupation of Hamburg, dissolution of the government or further coercion, it was now necessary to give way. All of northern Germany had joined Prussia, and one could not be sure what energetic steps Prussia could take.\u201cHamburg Im Bundesrat: Die Mitwirkung Hamburgs an Der Bildung Des Reichswillens 1867-1890\u201d, by Hans-Georg Sch\u00f6nhoff, Publ. Hamburg, 1967; p. 19 Kr\u00fcger, still their Bundestag envoy, was not without influence on the decisions during the critical hours, and then had to return to Frankfurt to make a joint statement of the three cities. His attitude had been cautious since 16 June. Thus a milder answer to Prussia than originally proposed on 22 June was then sent.Bismarck und die norddeutschen Kleinstaaten im Jahre 1866, by Karl Lange, pPubl. C. Heymann, Berlin 1930; pp 125 and 129 ==Hanseatic Minister-Resident in Berlin== In October 1866 he was appointed Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic cities in Berlin, in succession to Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken. When the new North German Federation came into being as a result of the Austro-Prussian war, among Kruger's most important tasks was the incorporation of the free cities he represented in the new federal and imperial structures. He advised on the take-over of the military establishments, the transition of the post and telegraph system to imperial control, and especially in the organisation of new customs relations. His own city L\u00fcbeck merged into the Customs Union shortly after joining the North German Federation, along with L\u00fcbeck\u2019s neighbours the two Mecklenburg states, while twenty years later he dealt with the Customs Union accession of Bremen and Hamburg. Shortly after his move to Berlin, he was able to inform Hamburg that the Prussian Ministry of Commerce could assist in promoting the construction of the Venlo-Hamburg railway, which Hamburg had agreed with Hanover before its annexation to Prussia. For Bremen, Kr\u00fcger negotiated the territorial exchanges necessary to enable the expansion of Bremen's harbour districts. ==Federal Council (Bundesrat)== In addition to his role as Hanseatic envoy in Berlin, he was appointed L\u00fcbeck\u2019s plenipotentiary to the new Federal Council in 1868, alongside Gustav Kirchenpauer who represented Hamburg. In the Federal Council, Kruger contributed to the Judicial Committee, maritime affairs, trade and transport, railway, post and telegraphs, Alsace- Lorraine and the construction of the Reichstag building. ==German Customs Union== He concluded the commercial treaty with the city of Hamburg by which that city entered the German Customs Union. On 25 May 1881 this agreement was signed between the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Johannes Versmann and William Henry O'Swald, and Kr\u00fcger, on the other. It stated that Hamburg was ready to accede to the Customs Union with all its territory, but excluding a permanent free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 of the imperial constitution would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished or restricted without Hamburg's approval.Borowsky,Peter. Hamburg and the Freeport - Economy and Society 1888\u2013-1914, publ Hamburg University Press, Hamburg, 2005; pp.114-115 In 1884 Bremen likewise applied to accede to the German Customs Union and he concluded negotiations in 1885. Bremen also secured a free port area, to be built below the old town. Also bonded warehouses for petroleum were to be set-up in the out-ports of Bremerhaven and Geestemunde.The Zollverein, by William Henderson, Publ. Cambridge University Press, 1939; p. 335 Kr\u00fcger died in post in Berlin on 17 January 1896, of a stomach bleeding. He was succeeded in April as Hanseatic Minister in Berlin by Karl Kl\u00fcgmann, also from L\u00fcbeck, who was appointed by the Senates of the three city states.
