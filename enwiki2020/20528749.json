It's the intersection of three avenues: Passeig de Valldaura, Passeig de Verdum and Via J\u00falia, Barcelona. Besides, it's the official border between four neighbourhoods of the district: Guineueta, Prosperitat, Porta and Verdum. Being scarcely more than a roundabout, its center is occupied since 1990 by a 30-metre high metal monument made by Josep Viladomat in the 1930s called La Rep\u00fablica, with the effigy of Francesc Pi i Margall. The monument was originally located in the much more famous intersection between Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and Avinguda Diagonal, which is nowadays still crowned by a Francoist monument. The November 29, 2015 the City Council announced the upcoming change of name of the square, which will be renamed \"Pla\u00e7a de la Rep\u00fablica\". The change will be effective on April 14, 2016. ==See also== *List of streets and squares in Nou Barris, Barcelona ==References== ==External links== *Noubarris.net Category:Nou Barris Category:Plazas in Barcelona ",
