    "text": "The Guadalmellato is a 110.5 km long river in Andalusia, Spain. It is a right hand tributary to the Guadalquivir. The Guadalmellato River has two dams. ==Course== The source of the Guadalmellato is at the Guadalmellato Reservoir where the waters of the Guadalbarbo, Cuzna and Varas meet; these are small rivers bringing waters from the Sierra Morena and subject to seasonal variations. The Guadalmellato flows roughly southwards for about 5 km into the San Rafael de Navallana Reservoir. Further downstream it meets the right bank of the Guadalquivir just east of Alcolea.GoogleEarth Part of the waters of the Guadalmellato are diverted before it flows into the Guadalquivir by means of a canal that runs parallel to the river. After flowing through Alcolea and parts of C\u00f3rdoba town the canal ends near Villarrubia, a suburb of C\u00f3rdoba.La hidrograf\u00eda de Adamuz == See also == * List of rivers of Spain * List of Roman bridges == References== == External links == * * Confederaci\u00f3n Hidrogr\u00e1fica del Guadalquivir Category:Guadalquivir ",
