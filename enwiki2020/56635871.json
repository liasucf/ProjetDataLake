    "text": "Boston City Council elections were held on November 8, 2005. Ten seats (six district representatives and four at-large members) were contested in the general election, as the incumbents in districts 5, 7, and 8 were unopposed. Five seats (the four at-large members, and district 9) had also been contested in the preliminary election held on September 27, 2005. ==At-large== Councillors Michael F. Flaherty, Felix D. Arroyo, and Stephen J. Murphy were re-elected, while the seat formerly held by Maura Hennigan was won by Sam Yoon. Hennigan did not seek re-election, as she ran for Mayor of Boston; she was defeated by incumbent Thomas Menino in the general election. Yoon became the first Asian American to hold elected office in Boston. {| class=wikitable !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidates !colspan=2 |Preliminary Election !colspan=2 |General Election |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | Michael F.
