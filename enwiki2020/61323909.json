Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=1253740 on 2019-07-20 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 7 mm, its diameter 2.5 mm. (Original description) The fusiform, elongated, slender shell is dark chestnut-brown throughout. It contains six whorls, slightly convex, separated by narrowly impressed sutures. The earlier two whorls are smooth, the remainder strongly latticed. There are 15 spirals on the body whorl, strong, equal and continuous. The longitudinal ribs number 22 on the body whorl, about as high as the spiral cords, but wider and more rounded, disappearing on the very short siphonal canal. The penultimate whorl contains 6 spiral cords. The aperture measures three-sevenths the total altitude of the shell. The outer lip is thickened by a rounded varix and is within crenulated by short lirae. The anal notch is deep, narrow and rounded, separated from the suture by a heavy callus. The siphonal canal is short and straight. Pilsbry, H.A. (1895) Catalogue of the Marine Shells of Japan with Descriptions of New Species and Notes on Others Collected by Frederick Stearns. F.
