    "text": "Keith Douglas Scott (born July 20, 1954) is a Canadian guitarist. He is best known for his long-term collaboration with the singer-songwriter Bryan Adams, for whom he plays lead guitar. He has also worked with Cher, Tina Turner, David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Tom Cochrane, Craig Northey, Jo\u00e3o Pedro Pais, Jann Arden and other musicians. ==Early life and career== Scott was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his father played jazz piano and his mother sang occasionally. While still at school, he learned how to play the acoustic guitar and, by the time he was 17, he had acquired a used 1960s Fender Stratocaster, which was to become a regular instrument. Many of his musical influences, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, were also associated with this instrument. Scott formed a band with people he had met at school but quickly found work with better-known bands such as \"Bowser Moon\", The Handley Page Group and Zingo, playing about 300 shows a year in the then lucrative nightclub scene. == Bryan Adams == Bryan Adams has described Scott as \"the most underrated guitarist ever\". Scott was introduced to Adams in Ontario in the summer of 1976. As the 1970s were coming to an end, he started doing some recording work for the then-unknown Adams. This proved successful and within a year Scott was touring with Adams. They have been together on stage ever since. With Bryan Adams during their tour in Bangalore, India in 2011. ==Musical style and influence== Writing for Premier Guitar, Nashville bassist and producer Victor Brod\u00e9n wrote: \"Keith Scott [...] is an endless source of inspiration for me. His solos are immediate. And anyone is able to sing them after just one or two listens. He plays the most simple, hooky, major-scale melodies, mixes them with a little blues to make them slightly dirty, and then finishes it all off with a right-hand attack and intent that floors me.\" Brod\u00e9n added: \"I try to craft my bass lines like Keith crafts guitar solos.\" ==Instruments and equipment== The Gretsch company produced a \"Keith Scott Nashville Gold Top\" signature guitar, to Scott's specifications. Keith mainly uses a Fender Stratocaster when on tour with Bryan Adams though he does change guitars throughout the set. In the early to mid 80s he used a Gibson Les Paul more and towards the end of the 80s he used a Telecaster on tour. Keith uses a variety of Boss Pedals as well as an Ibanez Tube Screamer. == References == == External links == * The Gretsch Guitars website \u2013 Keith Scott signature guitar Category:Canadian guitarists Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Lead guitarists ",
