    "text": "is a Japanese distilled beverage less than 45% alcohol by volume. It is typically distilled from rice (kome), barley (mugi), sweet potatoes (satsuma- imo), buckwheat (soba), or brown sugar (kokut\u014d), though it is sometimes produced from other ingredients such as chestnut, sesame seeds, potatoes or even carrots. Typically sh\u014dch\u016b contains 25% alcohol by volume, which is weaker than baijiu, whiskey or vodka but stronger than huangjiu, sake or wine. It is not uncommon for multiple-distilled sh\u014dch\u016b, which is more likely to be used in mixed drinks, to contain up to 35% alcohol by volume. ==Etymology== The word is the Japanese rendition of the Chinese shaojiu (), meaning \"burned liquor\", which refers to the heating process during distillation.What is the origin of the word sh\u014dch\u016b? Suntory The Chinese way of writing shaojiu with the word \u9152 is considered archaic and obsolete in modern Japanese, which uses the word \u914e. Both words mean \"liquor\". ==Culture== ===Drinking=== Choka: kettle to make hot sh\u014dch\u016b Sh\u014dch\u016b should not be confused with sake, a brewed rice wine. Its taste is usually far less fruity and depends strongly on the nature of the starch used in the distilling process. Its flavor is often described as \"nutty\" or \"earthy\". Sh\u014dch\u016b is drunk in many ways according to season or personal taste: * neat, i.e., on its own with nothing added * on the rocks, i.e., mixed with ice * diluted with room temperature water (\u6c34\u5272\u308a mizuwari) or hot water (\u304a\u6e6f\u5272\u308a oyuwari)Joe, Melinda, \"How I learned to stop worrying and love the shochu\", The Japan Times, 11 May 2012, p. 13 * mixed with oolong tea or fruit juice * as ch\u016bhai (sh\u014dch\u016b highball), a mixed drink consisting of sh\u014dch\u016b, soda, ice and some flavoring, often lemon, grapefruit, apple or ume (East Asian plum) * mixed very cold with a beer-flavored mixer known as Hoppy Sh\u014dch\u016b is widely available in supermarkets, liquor stores and convenience stores in Japan while canned chuhai drinks are sold in some of Japan's ubiquitous vending machines. However, it is more difficult to find sh\u014dch\u016b outside Japan except in urban areas with large enough Japanese populations. Interest in sh\u014dch\u016b has begun to grow in North America, particularly in cosmopolitan cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, and New York. Dedicated sh\u014dch\u016b bars have begun to appear in New York and more than 100 brands are now available in the U.S. market. In Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the center of production, sh\u014dch\u016b is far more common than sake. Indeed, here \"sake\" (\u9152) generally refers to sh\u014dch\u016b, and is normally consumed mixed with hot water. First hot water is poured into the glass, then sh\u014dch\u016b is gently added. The liquids mix naturally and stirring is unnecessary. Typically, the amount of sh\u014dch\u016b exceeds the amount of hot water, and is enjoyed for its aroma. Occasionally, sh\u014dch\u016b and water are mixed, left to stand for a day, and then gently heated. ===Boom=== The early 21st century witnessed a consumer boom in sh\u014dch\u016b within Japan, and in 2003 domestic shipments surpassed those of sake for the first time. Sh\u014dch\u016b bars appeared serving sh\u014dch\u016b exclusively, and premium brands with a focus on particular ingredients, production methods, or aging techniques entered the market. The beverage has undergone change of image; formerly it was seen as an old fashioned drink, but now has become trendy amongst young drinkers, particularly women. The boom also had negative effects: It caused a serious shortage of sweet potatoes, a basic ingredient of some popular types of sh\u014dch\u016b and, with the emergence of expensive premium brands, pricing scams appeared. In 2005 the Japanese television drama Kiken na Aneki illustrated this change in drinking habits. Its plot centered on the Minagawa family of Miyazaki Prefecture, who were brewers of a sweet potato sh\u014dch\u016b called imoj\u014dch\u016b. The lead character Hiroko (Ito Misaki) spends the majority of the series trying to come up with enough money to save the brewery from loan sharks, but in the process becomes involved with corporate distilleries. The larger companies formulate an advertising campaign that results in the imoj\u014dch\u016b becoming a popular drink. In this fictional account the beverage is marketed to young women, when it previously had been mostly consumed by the older male generation. There are several reasons for sh\u014dch\u016b's recent popularity. With increasing health-consciousness, many people see it as more healthy than some alternatives. There have been well-publicized claims of medical benefits, including that it can be effective in preventing thrombosis, heart attacks, and diabetes. It is also a versatile drink that is suited to most styles of cuisine. Shigechiyo Izumi, a Japanese citizen who apparently lived to be 105, made sh\u014dch\u016b part of his daily dietary regimen. This practice was mentioned along with his record in the Guinness Book of World Records. Because of his intimate passion for sh\u014dch\u016b, many have speculated that sh\u014dch\u016b is healthy and can actually promote longevity. This even prompted some local Ry\u016bky\u016b sh\u014dch\u016b brewers to market a special Longevity Liquor (\u9577\u5bff\u306e\u9152) sh\u014dch\u016b bearing his name on the front label. Despite these claims, Izumi's personal physician strongly advised against drinking sh\u014dch\u016b, as his kidneys were not strong enough to process sh\u014dch\u016b in his advanced age. But Izumi went on to say: \"Without sh\u014dch\u016b there would be no pleasure in life. I would rather die than give up drinking.\" ==History== Sh\u014dch\u016b graffiti at K\u014driyama Hachiman shrine. Furigana is shown to the right. It is signed by two carpenters and dated August 11 of the 2nd year of the Eiroku period, i.e.. 1559. The exact origin of sh\u014dch\u016b is unclear. Alcohol the strength of sh\u014dch\u016b was originally called araki (araq in Arabic) or rambiki\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5165\u9580 (alembic in English) in Japan; arak is a generic term for a variety of distilled alcoholic drinks throughout the Middle East. Sh\u014dch\u016b originated in Persia, spreading west to Europe and east to India, Thailand and Okinawa. Around the mid-16th century, the technique arrived in Kagoshima, where sh\u014dch\u016b was born. The distilled alcoholic beverage in Okinawa is known as Awamori. As far as can be determined from the Japanese historical record, sh\u014dch\u016b appears to have been made since at least as far back as the 16th century. When the missionary Francis Xavier visited Kagoshima Prefecture in 1549, he recorded that \"the Japanese drink arak made from rice [...] but I have not seen a single drunkard. That is because once inebriated they immediately lie down and go to sleep.\" The oldest existing direct reference to sh\u014dch\u016b in Japan can be found at K\u014driyama Hachiman shrine in \u014ckuchi, Kagoshima. There, two carpenters working on the shrine in 1559 inscribed the following graffiti on a wooden plank in the roof: \"The high priest was so stingy he never once gave us sh\u014dch\u016b to drink. What a nuisance!\" Source of the photo of the graffiti at K\u014driyama Hachiman Shrine. From these early times through to the Edo period sh\u014dch\u016b was produced throughout Japan in the traditional kasutori way, using a single round of distillation. During the Meiji period, machinery for repeated distillation was imported from Great Britain, making cheap mass-production of high-purity sh\u014dch\u016b possible during a time of chronic rice shortages. Sh\u014dch\u016b made the traditional way was called \"old-style sh\u014dch\u016b\" and that produced using the new multiple-distillation machinery \"new-style sh\u014dch\u016b.\" Genichir\u014d Kawachi (1883 -1948), who is said to be the father of modern sh\u014dchu and Tamaki Inui (1873 -1946), a lecturer at University of Tokyo succeeded in the first isolating and culturing aspergillus such as A. kawachii, A. awamori and a variety of subtaxa of A. oryzae, which made great progress in producing shochu in Japan, and since then aspergillus developed by Kawachi has also been used for soju and makgeolli in Korea.\u521d\u4ee3 \u6cb3\u5185\u6e90\u4e00\u90ce\uff081883\uff5e1948\uff09 Kawauchi-kin honpo\u5143\u7956 \u6e90\u4e00\u90ce\u3055\u3093\u306e\u751f\u30de\u30c3\u30b3\u30ea\uff1c\uff18\uff1e\u9ed2\u9eb9\u83cc\u306e\u5f79\u5272 \u767a\u9175\u4e2d\u306e\u96d1\u83cc\u7e41\u6b96\u9632\u3050 Okinawa times ==Definition and classification== Japan's alcohol taxation law, as revised in April 2006, defines two categories of sh\u014dch\u016b (in Japanese) (in Japanese) (also called white liquor). ===Multiply distilled sh\u014dch\u016b=== Alcohol distilled more than once with special machinery for that purpose, diluted for sale to an alcohol by volume level of less than 36%, that meets the following conditions: # Fruit or grain that has been allowed to germinate is not used as a base ingredient in whole or in part (preventing brandy and malt whisky from being considered sh\u014dch\u016b). # It is not filtered through charcoal. # If sugar is used as a base ingredient, in whole or in part, then the result of distillation must be at least 95% alcohol by volume (see discussion under brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b). # It is not fortified at distillation time with other than expressly permitted ingredients (eliminates liqueurs). Until the 2006 revision the law referred to this category as , sometimes abbreviated to \"k\u014dshu\" (\u7532\u713c). K\u014drui (Class A) in the classification of sh\u014dch\u016b simply means classification and does not mean that the quality is superior to that of Otsurui (Class B). It is generally distilled from a fermented liquid similar to molasses. Repeated distillation forms ethyl alcohol of high purity which is typically odorless and has a taste of little distinction. Water is then added, and the precise nature of this water has subtle effects on the taste and palatability of the sh\u014dch\u016b. Sh\u014dch\u016b k\u014drui is made from sweet potato, potato, and corn. It is generally produced in modern large factories. Distillers make sh\u014dch\u016b k\u014drui by weakening the distilled alcohol. The specialized distillation equipment, called a patent still lends it to mass production at low cost, so large corporations produce this kind of sh\u014dch\u016b in high volume. In Japan it retails in plastic bottle, can, and paper cup form and is consumed as a cheap alcoholic drink. It forms the base of several cocktails and liqueurs such as ch\u016bhai and umeshu. Single Distillation. Wooden pot stills are most often used at smaller distilleries. ===Singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b=== Alcohol distilled using other than multiple-distillation machinery, with alcohol by volume of no more than 45%, from one of the following: # ferment whose primary ingredient is grain or potato and their k\u014dji # ferment whose primary ingredient is grain k\u014dji # ferment whose primary ingredient is sake lees, possibly with rice and/or its k\u014dji (see kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b) # ferment whose primary ingredient is sugar (restricted types) and rice k\u014dji (see brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b) # ferment whose primary ingredient is grain or potato and their k\u014dji along with other ingredients,The large variety of permissible ingredients includes ashitaba, azuki beans, amachazuru, aloe, oolong tea, ume seeds, enokitake, otaneninjin, pumpkin, milk, ginkgo nuts, kudzu powder, kumazasa, chestnut, green peas, acorns, sesame, kombu, saffron, cactus, shiitake mushroom, shiso leaf, daikon radish, no-fat powdered milk, onion, various seaweeds, horse chestnut, tomato, dates, carrots, nori, peppers, water chestnut, sunflower seeds, safflower, matatabi vine, matcha, lily root, mugwort, lotus and wakame. provided the other ingredients form no more than 50% by weight # other substances with certain restrictions Until the 2006 revision the law referred to this category as , sometimes abbreviated to \"otsushu\" (\u4e59\u713c). Otsurui (Class B) in the classification of sh\u014dch\u016b simply means classification and does not mean that the quality is inferior to that of K\u014drui (Class A). The equipment used for single distillation is called a pot still. As the sh\u014dch\u016b is distilled just once it retains the character of the base ingredient, typically rice, barley or potato, with a strongly individual taste and aroma. Small-to-medium size enterprises make most brands, with the island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b famous as the centre of production. Recently however larger corporations have been entering the market. ====Maturation==== Fresh sh\u014dch\u016b is shipped after maturation. Maturation techniques vary in storage vessel and location, both of which affect the character of the sh\u014dch\u016b. The most commonly used containers for aging sh\u014dch\u016b are stainless steel tanks, clay pots, and wooden barrels or casks. As a result of maturation, the flavor and aroma of sh\u014dch\u016b settle. Maturation generally takes between one and three months. Maturation from three to six months is called beginning maturation. During this period, sharp flavors in the sh\u014dch\u016b generally decrease. Sh\u014dch\u016b matured from six months to three years usually has a mellow taste. A sh\u014dch\u016b called long-term maturation is matured for more than three years. But long-term maturation does not always improve the flavor. On the other hand, long-term maturation is particularly effective for awamori. Distillers often mature awamori for longer than ten years. =====Locations===== Sh\u014dch\u016b is matured in various places to impart unique flavors, typically where there are minimal variations in temperature and humidity. These places include tunnels and limestone caverns. ====Honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b==== Until 2006 Japanese postwar tax law classified sh\u014dch\u016b into \"k\u014drui\" and \"otsurui\" types. The terms and are Chinese celestial stems typically used for classification, and mean something akin to \"Grade A\" and \"Grade B\" respectively. Fearing a tendency to believe that otsurui sh\u014dch\u016b is somehow inferior to k\u014drui sh\u014dch\u016b, the Ky\u016bsh\u016b Otsurui Shochu Producers' Association lobbied the Finance Ministry, and in 1962 succeeded in having , or authentic sh\u014dch\u016b, recognized as an alternative name. The name is believed to have been coined in 1957 by Enatsu Junkichi, the president of Kirishima Brewery of Miyakonoj\u014d, Miyazaki Prefecture. (Japanese) However, since the term was not formally defined naming disputes arose. As a result, on 1 November 2002 the law was clarified and sh\u014dch\u016b satisfying any of conditions 1 to 5 of the above definition of singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b can be called honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b. Those satisfying the final condition are excluded. ===Sh\u014dch\u016b consumption in Japan by categories=== 2016 Sh\u014dch\u016b consumption in Japan by categories (tax base) is as follows; {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" |- ! style=\"width:2em;\" | Category!! Domestic (kl)!! Import (kl)!! Total (kl) |- | Multiply distilled || 341,583|| 44,033|| 385,616 |- | Singly distilled || 479,124|| 409|| 479,533 |- | Total || 820,707|| 44,442|| 865,149 |- |(Sake)|| 538,025|| 46|| 538,071 |} ==Moromitori sh\u014dch\u016b== Most singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b is moromitori sh\u014dch\u016b (\u3082\u308d\u307f\u53d6\u713c\u914e). This name derives from its production process: # Raw material treatment. Usually rice or barley is steeped in water, then steamed to promote starch gelatinization and cooled. # K\u014dji production. k\u014djikin, or koji mold spores, are cultivated onto the material to form koji mold which creates enzymes as it grows. The enzymes break starch molecules down into sugar molecules that can be fermented, a process called saccharification. # Primary fermentation. The koji is mashed by adding water and fermented for seven to nine days in a tank or vat to form unrefined alcohol, called moto or (first stage) moromi. # Secondary fermentation. The steamed main ingredient and water are added to the unrefined alcohol and fermented again to form (second stage) moromi. The ingredient added during this second stage determines the variety of sh\u014dch\u016b; for example if sweet potato is added then it becomes potato sh\u014dch\u016b. # Distillation. Purification of the unrefined moromi alcohol. ===K\u014dji=== honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b made from black k\u014dji. mold, a kind of Aspergillus fungus, has a profound effect on the final taste of the sh\u014dch\u016b. There are three varieties of k\u014dji mold with distinct characteristics. (Japanese) (Japanese) * Yellow k\u014dji (A. oryzae etc). Used to produce sake, and at one time all honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b. However yellow k\u014dji is extremely sensitive to temperature; its moromi can easily sour during fermentation. This makes it difficult to use in warmer regions such as Ky\u016bsh\u016b, and gradually black and white k\u014dji became more common. Its strength is that it gives rise to a rich, fruity refreshing taste, so despite the difficulties and great skill required it is still used by some manufacturers. It is popular amongst young people and women who previously had no interest in typically strong potato sh\u014dch\u016b, playing a role in its recent revival. Thus, white and black k\u014dji are mainly used in the production of sh\u014dch\u016b, but only yellow k\u014dji (A. oryzae) is usually used in the production of sake. * White k\u014dji (A. kawachii etc). Discovered as a mutation from black k\u014dji by Genichir\u014d Kawachi in 1923. This effect was researched and white k\u014dji was successfully grown independently. White k\u014dji is easy to cultivate and its enzymes promote rapid saccharization; as a result it is used to produce most sh\u014dch\u016b today. It gives rise to a drink with a refreshing, gentle, sweet taste. * Black k\u014dji (A. awamori also known as A. luchuensis etc) . Mainly used to produce sh\u014dch\u016b and awamori. In 1901, Tamaki Inui of the University of Tokyo succeeded in the first isolating and culturing.\uff1c\uff18\uff1e\u9ed2\u9eb9\u83cc\u306e\u5f79\u5272 \u767a\u9175\u4e2d\u306e\u96d1\u83cc\u7e41\u6b96\u9632\u3050 Okinawa times In 1910, Genichir\u014d Kawachi succeeded for the first time in culturing var. kawachi, a variety of subtaxa of A. awamori. This improved the efficiency of shochu production. It produces plenty of citric acid, which helps to prevent the souring of the moromi. Of all three k\u014dji it most effectively extracts the taste and character of the base ingredients, giving its sh\u014dch\u016b a rich aroma with a slightly sweet, mellow taste. Its spores disperse easily, covering production facilities and workers' clothes in a layer of black. Such issues led to it falling out of favour, but due to the development of New Kuro-k\u014dji (NK-k\u014dji) in the mid-1980s, interest in black k\u014dji resurged amongst honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b makers because of the depth and quality of the taste it produced. Several popular brands now explicitly state they use black k\u014dji on their labels. ===Water=== Water is one of the most important ingredients for making sh\u014dch\u016b. The quality of water affects that of sh\u014dch\u016b directly. Various kinds of water are used in the process of making sh\u014dch\u016b. ===Varieties=== There is a broad variety of moromitori sh\u014dch\u016b. Four locations have achieved protection as geographical indications under World Trade Organization TRIPS article 23 and are noted below. ====Rice sh\u014dch\u016b==== shares its base ingredient with sake. It has a fairly thick taste, and appears to have originally developed in regions too warm for sake production. Kumamoto Prefecture is particularly well known for its production of rice sh\u014dch\u016b. Notably produced in Hitoyoshi-bonchi is protected as a geographical indication. Rice sh\u014dch\u016b is also produced in regions famous for their sake, such as Niigata and Akita prefectures. ====Barley sh\u014dch\u016b==== is generally less distinctive than rice sh\u014dch\u016b and easy to drink. However, if cask-aged the taste can be quite sharp and strongly reminiscent of single-malt whisky. \u014cita Prefecture, Miyazaki Prefecture, and Iki in Nagasaki Prefecture are strong centres of production. has also been given protection as a geographical indication.http://shochudistilled.com/2013/05/20/kannoko-mugi-shochu/ ====Sweet potato sh\u014dch\u016b==== One brand of Satsuma sh\u014dch\u016b Various brands of sweet potato sh\u014dch\u016b uses sweet potato, widely cultivated across southern Ky\u016bsh\u016b since the Edo period, as its base ingredient. Originally it was almost exclusively produced in Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, but nowadays is made across Japan using locally grown sweet potatoes. It tends to have a strong taste and a distinctive smell; more recently producers have made varieties whose aroma is somewhat suppressed. Kagoshima's has been given protection under WTO rules as a geographical indication. The 1956 film The Teahouse of the August Moon portrayed an American-occupied Okinawan village rebuilding its economy with potato sh\u014dch\u016b. The taste of potato sh\u014dch\u016b is a bit smoky, evocative of some whiskeys. ====Brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b==== Various bottled Amami kokut\u014d sh\u014dch\u016b From the Edo period through to the time of the Pacific War, the Amami Islands produced drinks such as Awamori and a distilled alcohol based on brown sugar. From the middle of the war through to the American occupation, because of a shortage of rice (the base ingredient of Awamori) and an inability to export the sugar-based alcohol to the mainland, a large surplus was produced. In 1953, when the Amami Islands were returned to Japanese sovereignty, the alcohol was not classified as \"sh\u014dch\u016b\" under the 1949 alcohol tax law and therefore would attract a high rate of tax. The Ministry of Finance, taking into account the desire of local residents and as part of a strategy to promote the region, gave special recognition to the local alcohol as . This recognition was geographically restricted to Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture and was conditional on the use of rice k\u014dji. This regional restriction remains in place to this day; as can be seen in the legal definition of singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b above. Typically brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b contains 30% or 25% alcohol by volume. Contrary to what might be expected, brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b has a mild and not particularly sweet taste, as it contains no sugar. Nowadays it is produced in 25 breweries in 5 islands, such as Kikaijima, Amami \u014cshima, Tokunoshima, Okinoerabujima and Yoronjima, but Awamori is no longer made outside Okinawa Prefecture. Before the war another alcoholic drink based on brown sugar was made in the Ogasawara Islands. Its name translates as \"sugar alcohol\" and could be seen as a form of brown sugar sh\u014dch\u016b. Production ceased because of the war, but recently, aiming to revive its popularity, a similar alcohol, using no rice k\u014dji, has been introduced. However, as Ogasawara does not qualify for the above special regional exemption, this alcohol is instead classified as rum or spirits. ====Soba sh\u014dch\u016b==== Soba, or buckwheat, has origins going back to just 1973 when Unkai Brewery Co., of Gokase, Miyazaki Prefecture, developed it using soba from the local mountainous region as its base ingredient. Since then sh\u014dch\u016b producers across Japan have produced it, sometimes as part of a sh\u014dch\u016b blend. Taste is milder than barley sh\u014dch\u016b. ====Awamori==== Miyako island, Okinawa Okinawa is the home of sh\u014dch\u016b, which uses rice as its base ingredient. Prior to April 1983 it was labeled otsurui sh\u014dch\u016b, but is now properly called \"Authentic Awamori\". Awamori is made from Thai long-grained Indica crushed rice, not the usual short-grained Japonica of standard sh\u014dch\u016b. The fermentation process employs black koji mold indigenous to Okinawa rather than the standard white variety, and secondary fermentation is not performed. Fermentation is done in a way that creates plenty of citric acid, allowing it to be produced all year round despite Okinawa's hot climate. After distillation its strength is reduced with water to about 25% alcohol by volume, although some varieties go as high as 43%. Japanese law classifies Awamori as singly distilled honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b despite the different production process. With its method of production Awamori could theoretically be made anywhere in Japan, but Ry\u016bky\u016b Awamori (\u7409\u7403\u6ce1\u76db) is a protected geographical indication restricted to Okinawa.Okinawa Prefectural Government, \"Awamori\", Okinawa: Cultural Promotion Division, Okinawa Tourism and Cultural Affairs Bureau, 1996. ====Others==== Japanese law admits a very wide range of unusual base ingredients, such as perilla leaf, sesame and chestnut, and sh\u014dch\u016b made from most if not all of these exists. For example, there is a milk sh\u014dch\u016b brand called Makiba-no Yume. Others are generic sh\u014dch\u016b mixed with a particular fruit juice or extracts. With its peculiarity, such sh\u014dch\u016b is typically intended to catch the eye of visitors to a region and has attracted limited broader appeal. Soba sh\u014dch\u016b is a good example of one that has managed to achieve more widespread success. ==Kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b== In contrast to moromitori sh\u014dch\u016b, is made by distilling the sake lees left over from the fermentation of sake. It is a form of honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b. It first became popular in the north of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, and then spread to other areas, being manufactured during a period when it was not possible to brew refined sake across Japan. It is also widely used in sake production to stop fermentation before it is complete, which can help prevent degradation or give a dry taste. Sh\u014dch\u016b made for this purpose is called . During the Edo period sh\u014dch\u016b lees were used as a fertilizer during the rice-planting season. Many farms therefore installed distillation equipment to distill sake lees to produce sh\u014dch\u016b lees. Whilst the lees were used in the fields, the distilled alcohol was drunk, or offered to the gods, at the festival held at the end of the rice-planting season to pray for a bountiful harvest. Kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b has therefore also come to be known as sanaburi sh\u014dch\u016b. Owing to the recent surge in popularity of sh\u014dch\u016b in Japan, an increasing number of manufacturers have been making kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b. Most kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b is made in modern ways, sh\u014dch\u016b made via older production processes has decreased sharply. People who wish to preserve Japanese culture call sh\u014dch\u016b produced the historical way , such drinks have been revitalized by their activities. ===Slang usage=== Confusingly kasutori is also a slang term for a separate, inferior form of sh\u014dch\u016b. After the Pacific War, in a chaotic society with a shortage of good alcohol, moonshine sh\u014dch\u016b began to circulate. Its source and ingredients were not apparent, and in extreme cases contained toxic methyl alcohol diluted with water. Such sh\u014dch\u016b with ill side-effects became known as kasutori, and the association with poor sh\u014dch\u016b lingered, sometimes even affecting the image of \"real\" respectable kasutori sh\u014dch\u016b. The expressions kasutori literature and kasutori culture also came to be associated with the upheavals of the postwar period. ==Blended sh\u014dch\u016b== Singly distilled and multiply distilled sh\u014dch\u016b can be mixed to form . Formerly it was often mislabeled honkaku sh\u014dch\u016b, or had no indication of mixing or relative volumes. Starting in 2005 the industry regulated itself and created the blended sh\u014dch\u016b mark, with subcategorization based upon the relative volumes used. Singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b makes up 50%\u201395% of the total volume of singly distilled blended sh\u014dch\u016b. This category is targeted at those viewing pure singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b as having too strong a smell or taste, aiming to be softer and more easily drinkable. In multiply distilled blended sh\u014dch\u016b singly distilled sh\u014dch\u016b makes up 5%\u201350% of the total volume. With a focus on price, this tries to combine the cheap mass-production benefits of multiply distilled sh\u014dch\u016b whilst introducing some of the distinctive flavor and aroma of the singly distilled form. ==See also== *Awamori\u2014Distilled Okinawan alcoholic drink *Baijiu\u2014Distilled Chinese alcoholic drink *Soju\u2014Distilled Korean alcoholic drink ==References== ==External links== * Shochu Pro * Honkaku Shochu and Awamori * \u672c\u683c\u713c\u914e\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f * \u4e5d\u5dde\u713c\u914e\u63a2\u691c\u968a Category:Japanese distilled drinks Category:Japanese alcoholic drinks Category:Distilled drinks Category:Alcoholic drinks ",
