    "text": "Victoriapithecus macinnesi was a primate. It was described from a single fossil specimen, the oldest Old World monkey skull fossil. It was discovered near Lake Victoria in Kenya by Dr. Brenda Benefit. It dates from the middle Miocene and was closely related to the two or three extinct Prohylobates species. ==Morphology== Victoriapithecus macinnesi had a dental formula of 2:1:2:3 on both the upper and lower jaws. Its lower molars are bilophodont with low cusps. The canines show sexual dimorphism and the mandible is relatively deep compared to other Old World monkeys. On the forelimbs, the distal end of the humerus shows a narrow articulation and a deep ulnar notch. It had an average body mass of around and the volume of its brain was 36 cm3.Old World Monkey Had Tiny, Complex BrainCerebral complexity preceded enlarged brain size and reduced olfactory bulbs in Old World monkeys ==Range and locomotion== Victoriapithecus macinnesi lived in Africa. The postcranial remains indicate it was likely quadrupedal. ==References== ==External links== *Victoriapithecus macinnesi at members.tripod.com *Cercopithecidae at Mikko's Phylogeny archive * Category:Prehistoric monkeys Category:Miocene primates of Africa Category:Fossil taxa described in 1969 Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Miocene mammals of Africa ",
