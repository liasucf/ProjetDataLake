Zemurray gave the money to Harvard in honor of Zemurray\u2019s children, Samuel Zemurray, Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone.Gift of $250,00 Provides Woman Faculty Member, Harvard Crimson, 5 March 1947; the Harvard Crimson reported $250,000, but the Directory of Named Chairs (Harvard University Press) states that it was $225,000 (580). Samuel Zemurray, Jr., was a graduate of the Harvard Business School who was killed in World War II. Doris Zemurray Stone was a graduate of Radcliffe. This professorship was one of many endowed professorships the Zemurray Foundation provided for universities across the United States. Rather than establishing the professorship in a specific field of academic study, Zemurray chose to honor of his daughter by designating the professorship for a female candidate of academic renown. This allowed the Samuel Zemurray, Jr. and Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe Professor to work across disciplines, much like Harvard\u2019s University Professors. == List of professors == *Helen Maud Cam, 1947\u20131954, professor of English constitutional history *Cora du Bois, 1954\u20131968, professor of anthropologyDu Bois Vacates Zemurray Chair, Harvard Crimson, 20 November 1968 *Emily Vermeule, 1970\u20131994, professor of archaeology *Katharine Park, 1997\u2013present, professor of the history of scienceWomen\u2019s Studies Receives Second Tenured Professor, Harvard Crimson, 10 April 1997 *Amanda Claybaugh, 2010\u2013present, professor of English ==References== Category:Professorships at Harvard University Category:1947 establishments in Massachusetts ",
