    "text": "The Dauphin Map of Canada, c. 1543, showing Cartier's discoveries The name of Canada has been in use since the founding of the French colony of Canada in the 16th century. The name originates from a Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian word (or ) for \"settlement\", \"village\", or \"land\". It is pronounced in English and in standard Quebec French.In standard French of France, it is pronounced and this is an alternative standard pronunciation in Quebec French, but are considered informal in Quebec French: https://phono.uqac.ca/index.php?article=rubrique31 In Inuktitut, one of the official languages of the territory of Nunavut, the Iroquoian word (pronounced ) is used, with the Inuktitut syllabics \u1472\u14c7\u1455. The first French colony of Canada, which formed one of several colonies within New France, was set up along the Saint Lawrence River and the northern shores of the Great Lakes. Later the area became two British colonies, called Upper Canada and Lower Canada until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841. Upon Confederation in 1867, the name Canada was officially adopted for the new Dominion of Canada. ==Etymology== A map of North America ca. 1566, one of the first to include the name \"Canada\" (top right). The name Canada is now generally accepted as originating from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word (), meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\". Related translations include \"land\" or \"town\", with subsequent terminologies meaning \"cluster of dwellings\" or \"collection of huts\". This explanation is historically documented in Jacques Cartier's Bref r\u00e9cit et succincte narration de la navigation faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI. Although the Laurentian language, which was spoken by the inhabitants of St. Lawrence Valley settlements such as Stadacona (modern-day Quebec City) and Hochelaga (modern-day Montreal) in the 16th century, is now extinct, it was closely related to other dialects of the Iroquoian languages, such as the Oneida and Mohawk languages. Related cognates meaning \"town\" include nekantaa, ganataje and iennekanandaa in the Mohawk, Onondaga and Seneca languages respectively. Prior to archeological confirmation that the St. Lawrence Iroquois were a separate people from the Mohawk, most sources specifically linked the name's origin to the Mohawk word instead of the Laurentian one. A 1934 three-cent stamp commemorated the four-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of Canada by the French navigator, Jacques Cartier. A widespread perception in Canadian folklore is that Cartier misunderstood the term \"Canada\" as the existing proper name of the Iroquois people's entire territory rather than the generic class noun for a town or village \u2014 for instance, the Historica Foundation of Canada's Heritage Minute film devoted to Cartier's landing at Hochelaga is scripted as having Cartier believe that \"Kanata\" or \"Canada\" was the established name of the entire country.\"Heritage Minutes: Jacques Cartier\" . Historica Foundation of Canada. This is not supported by Cartier's own writings, however \u2014 in Bref r\u00e9cit, Cartier fully understands the actual meaning of the word (\"They call a town Canada\"), and his earliest name for the wider territory is \"le pays des Canadas\" (\"country of Canadas\", \"land of Canadas\" or \"land of villages\"). While the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian origin for the name Canada is now widely accepted, other theories have been put forth in the past. === Portuguese or Spanish origin theory=== The most common alternative theory suggested that the name originated when Portuguese or Spanish explorers, having explored the northern part of the continent and unable to find gold and silver, wrote (\"nothing here\" in Portuguese), or (\"Cape Nothing\" in Spanish) on that part of their maps. An alternative explanation favoured by philologist Marshall Elliott linked the name to the Spanish word \"ca\u00f1ada\", meaning \"glen\" or \"valley\".\"Further Conjectures as to the Origin of the Name 'Canada'\". The New York Times, September 5, 1908. The earliest iterations of the Spanish \"nothing here\" theory stated that the explorers made the declaration upon visiting the Bay of Chaleur,Thomas Jefferys, The Conduct of the French, with Regard to Nova Scotia. T. Jefferys (London), 1754. while later versions left out any identifying geographic detail. The known Portuguese presence in modern Canadian territory, meanwhile, was located in Newfoundland and Labrador. Neither region is located anywhere near Iroquoian territory, and the name Canada does not appear on any Spanish or Portuguese maps of the North American coast that predate Cartier's visit. No name for the Bay of Chaleur is attested at all in Spanish sources from that period, while the only name for Newfoundland attested in Portuguese sources is , after the region's plentiful cod. In most versions of the Iberian origin theory, the Spanish or Portuguese passed their name on to the Iroquois, who rapidly adopted it in place of their own prior word for a village; however, no historical evidence for any such Iberian-Iroquoian interaction has ever actually been found. Elliott's \"valley\" theory, conversely, was that the Spanish gave their name for the area directly to Cartier, who then entirely ignored or passed over the virtually identical Iroquoian word. According to Elliott, Cartier never explicitly stated that there was a direct connection between or as the Iroquoian word for \"village\" and Canada as the new name of the entire territory, and never accounted for the spelling difference between and Canada\u2014and thus the Spanish etymology had to be favoured because the spellings matched. Notably, Cartier never wrote of having any awareness of any preexisting Spanish or Portuguese name for the region either, meaning that Elliott's allegation that the derivation was not adequately supported by Cartier's own writing on the matter was also true of his own preferred theory. Franciscan priest Andr\u00e9 Thevet claimed that the word derived from (however these words do not exist in Spanish), an answer reportedly given by Spaniards in the St. Lawrence Valley area when asked what their purpose was; according to Thevet, the phrase meant that they were seeking landGervais Carpin, Histoire d'un mot: l'ethnonyme \"canadien\" de 1535-1691. Les \u00c9ditions de Septentrion, 1995. . p. 50. or that they were hunting.Olive Dickason, Le mythe du sauvage. Les \u00c9ditions de Septentrion, 1993. . p. 298. ===Minor or humorous theories=== British philologist B. Davies surmised that by the same process which initially saw the First Nations mislabelled as Indians, the country came to be named for the Carnata region of India or that region's Kannada ethnic group,Canadian Naturalist and Geologist, December 1861. p. 432. although his theory has attracted no significant support from other academics. Additional theories have attributed the name \"Canada\" to a word in an unspecified indigenous language for \"mouth of the country\" in reference to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, to a Cree word for \"neat or clean\",John Maclean, Canadian Savage Folk: The Native Tribes of Canada. C. W. Coates, 1986. to a claimed Innu war cry of \"kan-na-dun, Kunatun\", to a shared Cree and Innu word, \"p'konata\", which purportedly meant \"without a plan\" or \"I don't know\",Joseph Graham, Naming the Laurentians: A History of Place Names 'up North'. Les \u00c9ditions Main Street, 2005. . p. 65 to a short-lived French colony purportedly established by a settler whose surname was Cane, to Cartier's description elsewhere in his writings of Labrador as \"the land God gave to Cain\", or to a claim that the early French habitants demanded a \"can a day\" of spruce beer from the local intendant (a claim easily debunked by the facts that the habitants would have been speaking French, not English, and that canning did not exist until the 19th century). In their 1983 book The Anglo Guide to Survival in Qu\u00e9bec, humourists Josh Freed and Jon Kalina tied the Iberian origin theory to the phrase nada mas caca (\"nothing but shit\").Josh Freed and Jon Kalina, The Anglo Guide to Survival in Qu\u00e9bec. Eden Press, 1983. . p. 89. No historian or linguist has ever analyzed this explanation as anything more than an obvious joke. ==Canadian== The demonym \"Canadien\" or \"Canadian\" used to refer exclusively to the indigenous groups who were native to the territory. Its use was extended over time to the French settlers of New France, and later the English settlers of Upper Canada. ==New France== European explorer Jacques Cartier transcribed the word as \"Canada\" and was the first European to use the word to refer not only to the village of Stadacona but also to the neighbouring region and to the Saint Lawrence River, which he called rivi\u00e8re de Canada during his second voyage in 1535. By the mid 1500s, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada. Canada became the name of a colony in New France that stretched along the St. Lawrence River.MCC. \"Le territoire \", in La Nouvelle-France. Ressources fran\u00e7aises, Minist\u00e8re de la Culture et de la Communication (France), 1998, retrieved 2 August 2008 The terms \"Canada\" and \"New France\" were often used interchangeably during the colonial period. ==British North America== An 1851 Province of Canada postage stamp, the 3 pence beaver (\"Threepenny Beaver\") After the British conquest of New France (including ceding of the French colony, Canada) in 1763, the colony was renamed the Province of Quebec. Following the American revolution and the influx of United Empire Loyalists into Quebec, the colony was split on 26 December 1791 into Upper and Lower Canada, sometime being collectively known as \"The Canadas\", the first time that the name \"Canada\" was used officially, in the British regime. Some reports from the 1840s suggest that in that era, the word \"Canada\" was commonly pronounced \"Kaugh-na-daugh\" rather than its more contemporary pronunciation. Upper and Lower Canada were merged into one colony, the Province of Canada, in 1841, based on the recommendations of the Durham Report. The former colonies were then known as Canada East and Canada West, and a single legislature was established with equal representation from each. Underpopulated Canada West opposed demands by Canada East for representation by population, but the roles reversed as Canada West's population surpassed the east's. The single colony remained governed in this way until 1 July 1867, often with coalition governments. A new capital city was being built at Ottawa, chosen in 1857 by Queen Victoria, and became a national capital. ==Selection of the name Canada== Map of Canada on July 1, 1867, showing the nation's provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the colour white|right At the conferences held in London to determine the form of confederation that would unite the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), the Province of New Brunswick and the Province of Nova Scotia, a delegate from either Nova Scotia or New Brunswick proposed the name Canada in February 1867, and it was unanimously accepted by the other delegates. There appears to have been little discussion,Creighton, Donald. 1956. The Road to Confederation. Houghton Mifflin: Boston; p. 421. though other names were suggested. ===Other proposed names=== While the provinces' delegates spent little time, if any, in settling on Canada as the name for the new country, others proposed a variety of other names: * Anglia \u2013 the medieval Latin name for England * Albionoria \u2013 'Albion of the north' * Borealia \u2013 from borealis, the Latin word for 'northern'; compare with Australia * Cabotia \u2013 in honour of Italian explorer John Cabot, who explored the eastern coast of Canada for England * Colonia * Efisga \u2013 an acronym of English, French, Irish, Scottish, German, Aboriginal * Hochelaga \u2013 an old name for Montreal * Laurentia * Mesopelagia \u2013 'land between the seas' * New Albion * Norland * Superior * Tupona \u2013 derived from The United Provinces of North America * Transatlantica * Ursalia \u2013 'place of bears' * Vesperia \u2013 'land of the evening star' * Victorialand \u2013 in honour of Queen Victoria Walter Bagehot of The Economist newspaper in London argued that the new nation should be called Northland or Anglia instead of Canada.Moore, Christopher. 1997. 1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal. McClelland and Stewart: Toronto; p. 214. On these names, the statesman Thomas D'Arcy McGee commented, \"Now I would ask any honourable member of the House how he would feel if he woke up some fine morning and found himself, instead of a Canadian, a Tuponian or a Hochelegander?\". ==Adoption of Dominion== Map of the British Empire under Queen Victoria at the end of the nineteenth century. \"Dominions\" refers to all territories belonging to the Crown. During the Charlottetown Conference of 1864, John A. Macdonald, who later became the first Prime Minister of Canada, talked of \"founding a great British monarchy\", in connection with the British Empire. He advocated, in the fourth Canadian draft of the British North America Act, the name \"Kingdom of Canada,\"Farthing, John; Freedom Wears a Crown; Toronto, 1957 in the text is said: Canada's founders, led by Sir John A. Macdonald wished their new nation to be called the Kingdom of Canada, to \"fix the monarchical basis of the constitution.\" The governor general at the time, the Viscount Monck, supported the move to designate Canada a kingdom;Hubbard, R.H.; Rideau Hall; McGill- Queen's University Press; Montreal and London; 1977; p. 9 however, officials at the Colonial Office in London opposed this potentially \"premature\" and \"pretentious\" reference for a new country. They were also wary of antagonizing the United States, which had emerged from its Civil War as a formidable military power with unsettled grievances because British interests had sold ships to the Confederacy despite a blockade, and thus opposed the use of terms such as kingdom or empire to describe the new country. New Brunswick premier Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley suggested the term 'Dominion',Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Main Entry: do\u00b7min\u00b7ion; Function: noun; Etymology: Middle English dominioun, from Middle French dominion, modification of Latin dominium, from dominus; 4 often capitalized : a self-governing nation of the Commonwealth of Nations other than the United Kingdom that acknowledges the British monarch as chief of state inspired by Psalm 72:8 (from the King James Bible): \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"\"Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley\" Library and Archives Canada. This is also echoed in Canada's motto: A Mari Usque Ad Mare (Latin for \"from sea to sea\"). The term had been used for centuries to refer to the lands held by a monarch,Treaty of Utrecht 1713 \"Moreover, the most Christian King promises, as well in his own name, as in that of his heirs and successors, that they will at not time whatever disturb or give any molestation to the Queen of Great Britain, her heirs and successors, descended from the aforesaid Protestant line, who possess the crown of Great Britain, and the dominions belonging therunto.\" and had previously been adopted as titles for the Dominion of New England and the Dominion and Colony of Virginia. It continued to apply as a generic term for the major colonial possessions of the British Empire until well into the 20th century,\"... on the 23rd of April 1895, Tongaland was declared by proclamation to be added to the dominions of Queen Victoria ... \" () although Tilley and the other Fathers of Confederation broadened the meaning of the word 'dominion' to a \"virtual synonym for sovereign state\". Its adoption as a title for Canada in 1867 served the purpose of upholding the monarchist principle in Canada; in a letter to Queen Victoria, Lord Carnarvon stated: \"The North American delegates are anxious that the United Provinces should be designated as the 'Dominion of Canada.' It is a new title, but intended on their part as a tribute to the Monarchical principle which they earnestly desire to uphold.\". Macdonald, however, bemoaned its adoption. In a letter to Lord Knutsford on the topic of the loss of the use of the word kingdom, Macdonald said: Canadian post card from 1905. He added as a postscript that it was adopted on the suggestion of British colonial ministers to avoid offending republican sensibilities in the United States: Use of the term dominion was formalized in 1867 through Canadian Confederation. In the Constitution of Canada, namely the Constitution Act, 1867 (British North America Acts), the preamble of the Act indicates: And section 2 indicates that the provinces: In J.S. Ewart's two volume work, The Kingdom Papers, it is noted that the following names were considered for the union of British North America: \"The United Colony of Canada\", \"the United Provinces of Canada\", and \"the Federated Provinces of Canada\".; as per \"Rank and Name\", pp. 374\u2013381. Ewart was also an ardent advocate for the formation of \"the Republic of Canada\", a position which was rarely expressed in those times.. ===French terms for Dominion=== The French translation of the 1867 British North America Act translated \"One Dominion under the Name of Canada\" as \"une seule et m\u00eame Puissance sous le nom de Canada\" using Puissance (power) as a translation for dominion. Later the English loan-word dominion was also used in French.Le Petit Robert 1: dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise, 1990. The Fathers of Confederation met at the Quebec Conference of 1864 to discuss the terms of this new union. One issue on the agenda was to determine the Union's \"feudal rank\" (see Resolution 71 of the Quebec Conference, 1864). The candidates for the classification of this new union were: \"the Kingdom of Canada\" (le Royaume du Canada), \"the Realm of Canada\" (le Royaume du Canada), \"the Union of Canada\" (l'Union du Canada), and \"the Dominion of Canada\" (le Dominion du Canada). ===Use of Canada and Dominion of Canada=== There are numerous references in United Kingdom Acts of Parliament to \"the Dominion of Canada\" and the British North America Act, 1867 referred to the formation of \"one Dominion under the name of Canada\".Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 17 (direct quote, word for word) Nonetheless, the term \"Dominion of Canada\" appears in the Constitution Act, 1871 \u2014 usage of which was \"sanctioned\"Martin, Robert. 1993. Eugene Forsey Memorial Lecture: A Lament for British North America. The Machray Review. Prayer Book Society of Canada.\u2014A summative piece about nomenclature and pertinent history with abundant references. \u2014 and both appear in other texts of the period, as well as on numerous Canadian banknotes before 1935. Crowds on Parliament Hill celebrate Dominion Day 1927, the 60th jubilee of confederation Until the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was commonly used to identify the country. As Canada acquired political authority and autonomy from the United Kingdom, the federal government began using simply Canada on state documents. The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using 'Dominion' in the Statutes of Canada in 1951. Quebec nationalist leaders objected that dominion suggested that Ottawa would have control over Quebec. Under Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent, compromises were reached that quietly, and without legislation, \"dominion\" was retired in official names and statements, usually replaced by \"federal\". Dominion Day remained until in May 1980 when a private member's bill to replace the name with Canada Day was unexpectedly passed in the House. In the Senate, Eugene Forsey and the Monarchist League of Canada strongly defended the traditional usage. When a Gallup poll showed 70 percent of all Canadians favoured the change, the Senate approved the bill without a recorded vote.Alan Rayburn, Naming Canada: Stories about Canadian Place Names (2001) pp 17\u201322. The 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth dropped \"Dominion\" in her official title, and the UK replaced \"dominion\" with \"realm\" to refer to the Commonwealth countries. The 1982 Canada Act referred only to Canada, and the national holiday was renamed from Dominion Day to Canada Day. Section 4 of the 1867 BNA Act also declares that: \"Unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, the Name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act\". and this has been interpreted to mean that the name of the country is simply Canada. No constitutional statute amends this name, and the subsequent Canada Act 1982 does not use the term dominion. Official sources of the United Nations system, international organizations (such as the Organization of American States), the European Union, the United States, and other polities with which Canada has official relations as a state consistently use Canada as the only official name, state that Canada has no long-form name, or that the formal name is simply Canada. No Canadian legal document states that the name of the country is anything other than Canada. The terms Dominion and Dominion of Canada are still considered to be appropriate, although arcane, titles for the country.Forsey, Eugene A., in Marsh, James H., ed. 1988. \"Dominion\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Hurtig Publishers: Toronto.Canadian Heritage: National Flag of Canada Day - How Did You Do? , Canada's Digital Collections: Confederation 1867, Canadian Heritage: The Prince of Wales Royal Visit 2001, Quiz. The federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these titles, although these publications are not themselves legal or official documents.Canadian Heritage: National Flag of Canada Day - How Did You Do? , Canada's Digital Collections: Confederation 1867, Canadian Heritage: The Prince of Wales Royal Visit 2001, Quiz Forsey, Eugene A. 2005. How Canadians Govern Themselves (PDF), 6th ed. Canada: Ottawa; pp. 8-9. The preface to the publication specifies that the opinions reflected are those of the author, and \"do not necessarily reflect those of parliament.\" For instance, in 2008 the Canadian government registered the Maple Leaf Tartan, designed in 1964, with the Scottish Tartans Authority. The tartan's alternate name is \"Dominion of Canada.\" The terms Dominion of Canada and Dominion have also been used to distinguish contemporary (post-1867) Canada from either the earlier Province of Canada or from the even earlier The Canadas. The terms have also been used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though in this usage \"federal\" has replaced \"dominion\". For example, The Canadian Almanac stopped using Dominion of Canada in 1964. ==See also== * *List of Canadian place names of Royal heritage *Canadian provincial and territorial name etymologies *Origins of names of cities in Canada *List of Canadian place names of Ukrainian origin *List of Canadian place names of Indigenous origin *List of Canadian place names of English origin *List of Canadian place names of Scottish origin *List of Canadian place names of Spanish origin ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * Choudry, Sujit. 2001(?). \"Constitution Acts\" (based on looseleaf by Hogg, Peter W.).
