    "text": "Berliner in preparation A Berliner Pfannkuchen (referred to as Berliner for short outside Berlin, but Pfannkuchen inside Berlin) is a traditional German pastry similar to a doughnut with no central hole, made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top. They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or advocaat filling, or with no filling at all. ==Preparation== The yeast dough contains a good deal of eggs, milk and butter. For the classical Pfannkuchen made in Berlin the dough gets balled, deep-fried in lard, whereby the distinctive bright bulge occurs, and then filled with jam. The filling is related to the topping: for plum-butter, powdered sugar; for raspberry, strawberry and cherry jam, sugar; for all other fillings, sugar icing, sometimes flavoured with rum. Today the filling usually is injected with a large syringe or pastry bag after the dough is fried in one piece. Today, Berliners can be purchased throughout the year, though they were traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (Silvester) as well as the carnival holidays (Rosenmontag and Fat Tuesday). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone.Berlin: Full of history, lifestyle and home-style cuisine at GermanFoods.org ==Names== The terminology used to refer to this delicacy differs greatly in various areas of Germany. While called Berliner Ballen or simply Berliner in Northern and Western Germany, as well as in Switzerland, the Berliners themselves and residents of Brandenburg, Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony know them as Pfannkuchen, which literally translates to \"pancakes\", and in the rest of Germany generally refers to Palatschinke (also called Eierkuchen, which translates to \"egg cakes\"). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of Krapfen (derived from Old High German kraffo and furthermore related to Gothic language krappa), sometimes called Fastnachtskrapfen or Faschingskrapfen to distinguish them from Bauernkrapfen. In Hesse they are referred to as Kr\u00e4ppel or Kreppel. Residents of the Palatinate call them also Kreppel or Fastnachtsk\u00fcchelchen (\"little carnival cakes\"), hence the English term for a pastry called \"Fasnacht\"; further south, the Swabians use the equivalent term in their distinctive dialect: Fasnetskiachla. In South Tyrol, Triveneto and other parts of Northern Italy, the food is called kraffen or krapfen, while in the southern parts it can be referred as bomba or bombolone. In Slovenia it is (Trojanski) krof; in Portugal it is \"Bola de Berlim\" (Berlin Ball); in Croatia it is krafni; while in Bosnia and Serbia it is called krofne. In Poland they are known as p\u0105czki, in Ukraine as \"\"; and in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called b\u00e9csi f\u00e1nk, meaning Viennese doughnut, as it was transited by Austria to the Hungarian kitchen.Meyers, June. Authentic Hungarian Heirloon Recipes Cookbook The pastry is called Berlinerbol in the Netherlands, Berlijnse bol and boule de Berlin in Belgium, hillomunkki or (glazed) berliininmunkki in Finland, berlinerbolle in Norway, Berl\u00ednarbollur in Iceland, \u0161i\u0161ka in Slovakia, and gogo\u0219i in Romania. In Denmark it is called \"Berliner\". In Turkey they're known as Alman Pastas\u0131 (German Pie). All of these are similar preparations. ==International variations== The Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In English- speaking countries, Berliners are a type of doughnut usually filled with jam, jelly, custard, or whipped cream. In South Australia, however, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglo- America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is \"jelly doughnut\". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not \"set\" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream. The cream or custard-filled varieties usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.\"Donut\", Massachusetts Secretary of State In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest and West in the US, such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a \"bismark\" or \"bismarck\" (after Otto von Bismarck), while a filled bar doughnut is called a \"long john\", and usually contains pastry cream, custard, or whipped cream, but can also contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include \"jambuster\" in Manitoba,The History of the Jelly Doughnut at Leite's Culinaria and \"Burlington bun\" in Nova Scotia. Bola de Berlim from Portugal In Portugal, Berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as bolas de Berlim (lit. Berlin ball), and the filling is frequently an egg-yolk based yellow cream called creme pasteleiro (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half-length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country. Such versions are also found in Latin American countries with German descended populations, such as in Mexico (berlinesas), Chile (Berl\u00edn), Paraguay (bollo), Venezuela (bomba), Uruguay and Argentina (bola de fraile or suspiro de monja or berlinesa), where it is filled not only with custard (called \"Crema pastelera\"), but also with jam (especially red ones), dulce de leche, or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called sonhos (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow custard (called simply creme). Some modern variants are filled with doce de leite, goiabada, or a mix of chocolate and doce de leite. In Israel, a version of the pastry called sufganiyah (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4) is traditionally consumed during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. Traditional sufganiyot are usually filled with jam and covered with powdered sugar. Although, many other modern variants exist as well.The 8 Best Hanukkah Sufganiyot in Israel at Haaretz.com In Finland, berliininmunkki (lit. Berlin's doughnut) is a commonly consumed pastry, although unlike a traditional Berliner, this variant has pink caramel colored frosting on top as opposed to regular or powdered sugar. ==John F. Kennedy urban legend== John F. Kennedy's words \"\" are standard German for \"I am a Berliner\". Mentioned in Len Deighton's 1983 novel Berlin Game, an urban legend has it that due to his use of the indefinite article ', ' is translated as \"jelly doughnut\", and that the population of Berlin was amused by the supposed mistake. This is incorrect, insofar as when leaving out ', the meaning only changes slightly (compare I am Berliner and I am a Berliner). The normal convention when stating a nationality or, for instance, saying one is from Berlin, would be to leave out the indefinite article '. Throughout the 1980s, the lie was spread even by reputable media like The New York Times, The Guardian, BBC and NBC. However, Kennedy used the indefinite article here correctly to emphasize his relation to Berlin. Additionally, the word ' is not used in Berlin to refer to the '. These are simply called ' there and therefore no Berliner would mistake Berliner for a doughnut. ==See also== * Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria * List of doughnut varieties * List of German desserts * P\u0105czki, traditional Polish pastries * Sufganiyah * ==References== Category:Culture in Berlin Category:Custard desserts Category:Doughnuts Category:German cuisine Category:German desserts Category:German pastries Category:Carnival foods Category:New England cuisine Category:Portuguese cuisine Category:Uruguayan desserts ",
