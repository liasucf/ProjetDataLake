    "text": "Residents Against SARP Pollution (RASP) was formed in June 1998 in response to two incidents of toxic gases escaping the SARP UK chemical plant in May 1998, in the town of Killamarsh on the border of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, England. The campaign was formed by local residents and members of the Socialist Party (England and Wales). The campaign eventually succeeded in forcing the closure of most of the SARP plant. ==Formation of RASP== After a public meeting called by the Socialist Party (England and Wales), Ken Coates MEP, who was invited to speak, called for further meetings, which gave rise to the campaign, and also set up an independent inquiry into the site. The year- long campaign involved marches and rooftop protests. RASP protesters even travelled to SARP's headquarters in France to protest. ==Victory== The campaigners eventually won the closure of six of the seven sections of the site in late 1999, with the local council looking at siting non-toxic recycling processes on the site.Victory Over Polluters, The Socialist 12 November 1999 ==Campaign Officers== Chair - Kevin Jones Secretary - Faye Moran Treasurer - Pat Whitehouse Vice Chair - Roger Barraclough Membership Secretary - Samantha Martin Press Officer - John Moran Campaigns Officer - Alistair Tice Legal Officer - Bev Smith Youth Organisers - Tracey Nettleship, Emma Horsford Publicity Officer - Trevor Cockerill Contacts for the Townships:- Beighton - Dave Milsom Wales/Kiveton - Mike Sampson Swallownest - Paul Marshall RASP Officers from RASP website - retrieved 17 August 2007 ==References== ==External links== *RASP website Category:Environmental organisations based in England Category:Environment of South Yorkshire Category:Environment of Derbyshire ",
