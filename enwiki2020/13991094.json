His citation read: :Captain Henry John Francis Hunter, Rifle Brigade, and Royal Flying Corps. ::\"For conspicuous gallantry and skill. He has done fine work for the artillery, and has accounted for many enemy guns. On one occasion, when a heavy storm drove all other machines back to their aerodromes, and the enemy guns took the opportunity to become active, he remained up and did fine work.\" On 1 June 1917 he was appointed squadron commander, with the acting rank of major, of No. 9 Squadron RFC, flying the R.E.8 in France. He received a mention in despatches on 7 November 1917. On 1 April 1918, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and Hunter was transferred to the RAF with the rank of captain (acting- major). On 17 April he was appointed commander of No. 42 Squadron RAF, another R.E.8 squadron in France. ===Inter-war career=== On 15 January 1919 Hunter was appointed to command of No. 105 Squadron RAF, a Bristol F.2 Fighter reconnaissance squadron based in Omagh, Northern Ireland. On 11 July he received another mention in despatches. He served as the commander of the School of Army Co-operation at Old Sarum from 25 July, and on 1 August resigned his commission in the Rifle Brigade after being awarded a permanent commission as a major in the RAF. A year later, on 1 August 1919, when the RAF adopted its own rank system, Major Hunter became Squadron Leader Hunter. On 1 March 1921 he was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 12 Squadron RAF part of the Army of Occupation in Germany, based at Bickendorf.

On 30 January 1942 Hunter was appointed Air Officer Commanding, No. 225 (Bomber) Group in southern Sumatra, operating from an airfield at Prabumulih, codenamed \"P2\", in a vain attempt to stem the Japanese advance. However, despite some local successes, the ABDACOM forces were soon overwhelmed, and following the Battle of Palembang all Allied personnel were evacuated from the island by 16 February. From 20 April 1942 to 1 May 1943 Hunter served as AOC, No. 221 (Bomber) Group, later No. 221 (Tactical) Group, then from 1 May 1943 to 5 October 1944 as AOC, No. 223 (Composite) Group, both based in India.

Geoffrey Pearson, on 11 April 1918. ==Sporting activities== Hunter was also a keen tennis player, competing at Wimbledon in the men's singles in 1924, 1927 and 1930. He was beaten in the first round in the first and third of these, but in 1927 defeated Anthony Wass Buzzard to progress to the second round, where he was beaten in straight sets by the French champion Jacques Brugnon. He also competed at Monte Carlo in 1928, but again did not progress through from the first round, being beaten by the Czech Friedrich Rohrer, who had represented his country at the 1924 Olympics. He fared better against his fellow officers, reaching the final of the RAF Singles Championship in 1925, only to be beaten by the title holder Flying Officer Charles Frederick Roupell. In 1930 he made it through to the third round. However he had the consolation of being RAF Doubles Champion, partnered with Squadron Leader Richard Saul, for several years. ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Rifle Brigade officers Category:Royal Flying Corps officers Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:English male tennis players Category:British male tennis players Category:Tennis people from Greater London ",
