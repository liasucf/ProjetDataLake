The plant operates at an installed capacity of , with an average annual production of about 252 GWh. It is owned by Salten Kraftsamband and came into operation in 1975. The Fagerli plant was the first one built by Salten Kraftsamband, in cooperation with Sulitjelma Mines. ==The old Fagerli Power Station== The old Fagerli power station was built by Sulitjelma Mines. The remaining buildings currently belong to the Sulitjelma Museum. By 1898 a power station had been set up at the outflow of the Balmi River into Langvatnet, also named the Fagerli Power Station. It was built by Sulitjelma Mines and supplied electricity for general use in Sulitjelma and to the mine. It originally had an installed capacity of 175 kVA and a voltage of 5 kV. The power station was upgraded several times, and in 1929 a 4.2 MVA generator was installed with a 3.6 MW turbine. The gross head was with a maximum discharge of . A particular problem was the large amount of sediment carried by the Balmi River, which caused extensive wear and tear to the turbines.Solem, Arne, Ragnar Heggstad, & Nils Raabe. 1954.
