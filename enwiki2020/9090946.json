Athletic teams are known as the \"Crimson Streaks\". == History == *1896 \u2013 St. Joseph Central Catholic is founded. A brick house on the northeast corner of Croghan and Wood streets was purchased, remodeled and used as a high school facility until it was torn down in 1907 to make way for a new building. *1908 \u2013 A new building was completed at an estimated cost of $80,000 (nearly 2,000,000 in 2017). *1918 \u2013 Marked the beginning of the athletic tradition at St. Joseph High School with an athletic association created in September and the first basketball team organized that fall. *1957 \u2013 A new High School only building was completed on the corner of Croghan and North Clover Streets. The former building was used as St. Joseph Elementary School, with the new high school located next door. *2011 \u2013 The three Catholic Elementary Schools in Fremont (St. Ann, St. Joseph & Sacred Heart) along with SJCC High School were consolidated into one school system named Bishop Hoffman Catholic Schools. The name was chosen to honor the late Bishop James Hoffman, a native of Fremont, who served as Bishop from 1981 until his death in 2003. Under this configuration, Grades Pre-K through 3rd were located at the former Sacred Heart Elementary building, Grades 4\u20138 were located at the former St. Joseph Elementary building and the High School (Grades 9\u201312) remained the same. The former St. Ann Elementary building was closed. *2015 \u2013 Reconfiguration of Bishop Hoffman Catholic Schools resulted in the closing of the aging St. Joseph Elementary building that served students for 107 years. In the new configuration, grades Pre-K through 6th are at the Sacred Heart Campus. Grades 7\u20138 are at the newly created Bishop Hoffman Junior High Academy located inside the high school building. The high school students, grades 9\u201312, remain in the high school building. ==Athletics== ===Sports offered=== *Football *Cross Country *Golf *Tennis *Volleyball *Basketball *Band *Cheerleading *Bowling *Baseball *Softball *Swimming *Track and Field *Wrestling ===League membership=== *Sandusky Bay Conference, 1948\u20131986, 2016\u2013Present *Midland Athletic League, 1986\u20132014 *Sandusky River League, 2014\u20132016 ===Notable state finishes=== Baseball *1988 - Division IV Final Four *2004 - Division IV Final Four *2007 - Division IV Final Four Cross Country *2001 - Boys Division III 3rd Place Football *1974 - Class A Runner-Up *1978 - Class A Final Four Golf (Boys) *1990 - Division III Runner-Up *1991 - Division III Runner-Up *1992 - Division III Runner-Up *1993 - Division III Runner-Up Track (Boys) *1993 - Division III Runner-Up ==Notable alumni== * Mark Coleman, retired mixed martial artist UFC Hall of Fame member * Tom Beier, American Football ==References== ==External links== * Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ohio Category:High schools in Sandusky County, Ohio Category:Educational institutions established in 1908 Category:Buildings and structures in Fremont, Ohio Category:1908 establishments in Ohio ",
