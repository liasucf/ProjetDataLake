    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois J. Terby (9 August 1846 - 20 March 1911) was a Belgian astronomer. He had a private observatory at Leuven, Belgium and was an early ardent advocate of the existence of Martian canals. He collected drawings of Mars and wrote the work Ar\u00e9ographie in 1875. He tracked down the Mars drawings of Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter and deposited them at the University of Leiden, where they would eventually finally be published in 1881. A crater on Mars (Terby) is named after him. Category:1846 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Belgian scientists Category:Belgian astronomers ",
