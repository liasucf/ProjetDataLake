It is the church for the \u00d8lve parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1861 using designs by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 230 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1432, but it was not new that year. Around the 1640s, the old stave church was torn down and replaced with a new timber-framed building. The Barony Rosendal was established in 1678 and the church was given as part of the barony. The church was owned by the Barony from 1678 until 1855 when it was sold to the municipality. In 1788, the church was renovated. In 1861, the church was torn down and replaced with a new church on the same site. The new church was consecrated on 13 October 1861. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj\u00f8rgvin ==References== Category:Kvinnherad Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1861 Category:14th-century establishments in Norway ",
