    "text": "The 1887 FA Cup Final was a football match between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion at the Kennington Oval. It was the final of the fifteenth staging of the FA Cup which saw 124 teams compete for the final. The final was won by Aston Villa with goals coming from Archie Hunter and Hodgetts to give Aston Villa a 2\u20130 victory. ==Route to the Final== Aston Villa's route to the final was a turbulent one, smashing Wednesbury Old Athletic 13\u20130 in the first round, but having to play three replays against Wolverhampton Wanderers. After that, they recovered to make it to the final. Although West Bromwich Albion didn't have any wins nearly as large as Aston Villa's, their path to the final was less turbulent, constantly defeating teams without much variation.https://web.archive.org/web/20080723204636/https://www.fa- cupfinals.co.uk/1887.html Aston Villa {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"150\"|Round !width=\"150\"|Opponent !width=\"150\"|Score |- |1||Wednesbury Old Athletic||13\u20130 |- |2||Derby Midland||6\u20131 |- |3||Wolverhampton Wanderers||2\u20132 |- |3 (Replay)||Wolverhampton Wanderers||1\u20131 |- |3 (Second Replay)||Wolverhampton Wanderers||3\u20133 |- |3 (Third Replay)||Wolverhampton Wanderers||2\u20130 |- |4||Notts County||Both teams allowed through |- |5||Horncastle||5\u20130 |- |6||Darwen||3\u20132 |- |Semi-Finals||Rangers||3\u20131 |} West Bromwich Albion {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"150\"|Round !width=\"150\"|Opponent !width=\"150\"|Score |- |1||Burton Wanderers||6\u20130 |- |2||Derby Junction||2\u20131 |- |3||Crewe Alexandra||Both teams allowed through |- |4||Mitchell St. George's||1\u20130 |- |5||Lockwood Brothers||1\u20130 (Match voided) |- |5 (replay)||Lockwood Brothers||2\u20131 |- |6||Notts County||4\u20131 |- |Semi- Finals||Preston North End||3\u20131 |} ==Background== Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion had already played each other in the FA Cup once, in 1885. They played out a goalless draw, with West Bromwich winning the replay 3\u20130. Although the two clubs have a fierce rivalry, this match was well before the rivalry developed and was probably not even a catalyst for the rivalry. ==Match== After defeating the incredibly strong team Preston North End in the semis, West Bromwich began the match as favourites. For forty-five minutes, the Aston Villa defense was besieged. The Albion strikers even attempted to run the goalie over his own goal line. However, the first half ended goalless. In the second half, momentum began to shift Villa's way, as West Brom lost confidence. Finally, Villa broke the deadlock when Archie Hunter fired home, the West Brom goalie not even attempting a save, believing Hunter to be offside. In the final minute, Villa completed the win, with Dennis Hodgetts colliding with West Bromwich Albion goalie Bob Roberts, and poking the ball over the line to make it 2\u20130 ===Details=== Aston Villa, winning side {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| width=100% cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=0 |colspan=\"4\"|Aston Villa \\---- |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK || Jimmy Warner || |- |DF || Frank Coulton || |- |DF || Joseph Simmonds || |- |MF || John Burton || |- |MF || Harry Yates|| |- |MF || Frankie Dawson || |- |FW || Richmond Davis || |- |FW || Albert Brown || |- |FW || Archie Hunter (Captain) Goal || |- |FW || Howard Vaughton || |- |FW || Dennis Hodgetts Goal|| |- |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=100% |colspan=\"4\"|West Bromwich Albion \\---- |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK || Bob Roberts || |- |DF || Harry Green || |- |DF || Albert Aldridge || |- |MF || Ezra Horton || |- |MF || Charlie Perry || |- |MF || George Timmins || |- |FW || George Woodhall || |- |FW || Tommy Green || |- |FW || Jem Bayliss (Captain) || |- |FW || Jack Paddock || |- |FW || Tom Pearson|| |} |} ==See also== * Aston Villa F.C.\u2013West Bromwich Albion F.C. rivalry \u2014 ==References== 1887 Category:1886\u201387 in English football Category:Aston Villa F.C. matches Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. matches Category:April 1887 sports events ",
