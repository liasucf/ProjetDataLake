    "text": ", meaning nuclear power plant earthquake disaster (from the two words Genpatsu \u2013 nuclear power plant \u2013 and Shinsai \u2013 earthquake disaster) is a term which was coined by Japanese seismologist Professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi in 1997.Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake- induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Slides), Katsuhiko Ishibashi, 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28 It describes a domino effect scenario in which a major earthquake causes a severe accident at a nuclear power plant near a major population centre, resulting in an uncontrollable release of radiation in which the radiation levels make damage control and rescue impossible, and earthquake damage severely impedes the evacuation of the population. Ishibashi envisages that such an event would have a global impact and a 'fatal' effect on Japan, seriously affecting future generations.Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Abstract), Katsuhiko Ishibashi, 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28 In Japan, Ishibashi believes that a number of nuclear power stations could be involved in such a scenario, but that the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, located near the centre of the expected T\u014dkai earthquakes, is the most likely candidate. He is also concerned that a similar scenario could take place elsewhere in the world. As a result, he believes that the matter should be a global concern. ==See also== *Nuclear power in Japan **Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster **2011 Japanese nuclear accidents *Nuclear power **Nuclear power debate **Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents *Seismicity in Japan *International Nuclear Event Scale ==External links== * Katsuhiko Ishibashi: \"Why worry?
