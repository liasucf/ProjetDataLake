    "text": "A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas (1952; second edition, 1990) is a two-volume index, published as volumes 2 and 3 of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\u2019s collection Great Books of the Western World. Compiled by Mortimer Adler, an American philosopher, under the guidance of Robert Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, the volumes were billed as a collection of the 102 great ideas of the western canon. The term \u201csyntopicon\u201d was coined specifically for this undertaking, meaning \u201ca collection of topics.\u201dAdler, Mortimer J.. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. The volumes catalogued what Adler and his team deemed to be the fundamental ideas contained in the works of the Great Books of the Western World, which stretched chronologically from Homer to Freud. The Syntopicon lists, under each idea, where every occurrence of the concept can be located in the collection's famous works. The Syntopicon was revised as part of the second edition of the collection. ==History== The Syntopicon was created to set the Great Books collection apart from previously published sets (such as Harvard Classics). Robert Hutchins, at the time, in addition to being the president of the University of Chicago, also served as Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Hutchins and Adler were recruited by the encyclopedia's publisher for a \u201cspecial idea\u201dAllen, J. S. (1983).

In the end, the Syntopicon would require over 400,000 man-hours of readingAdler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library and cost over two million dollars.Mortimer, Adler J. Letter to J. Loy Maloney. 11 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL. Britannica publisher Senator William Benton joked at the Great Books presentation dinner that \u201cthe Syntopicon is said to be the most expensive two volumes editorially in all publishing history. How Hutchins and Adler achieved that unique distinction, the publisher is still trying to figure out. (Clifton Fadiman) assured me some day the story will be told. I\u2019d like it whenever I can get it.\u201dBenton, William. \"Great Books of the Western World.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Presentation Dinner. Waldorf Astoria, New York City. 15 Apr. 1952. The process of cataloging each appearance of one of the \u201cGreat Ideas\u201d in all 431 works by 71 authors in the collection was so arduous that the Syntopicon nearly did not make it to print. Before it even came time to print, the budget had topped a million dollars and there was not even \u201ca penny for paper\u201d left.Adler, Mortimer J. Untitled Letter, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. Adler persevered, however, having spent the previous eight years of his life on the project. He single-handedly raised funds by selling more expensive \u201cFounders Editions\u201d of the sets, and disobeyed the order to fire his entire staff. There were times, during the process when he admitted: \u201cthe question was could we sell the plates for junk! Could we dispose of the plates as old metal?\u201d Adler felt, through it all, that he was creating something completely new. The Syntopicon, he felt, would be revolutionary, its release on par with such events as the creation of the first dictionary. It would do for ideas what previous reference books had done for words and facts. He worked with a team of over 100 readers who met twice a week for years to discuss the readings and the ideas within them. Among his editorial team was a young Saul Bellow. In the end, he produced two volumes, which listed the 102 Great Ideas of the western world, from Angel to World. The set was released with much fanfare, including an honorary gifting of the first two editions to U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Elizabeth II. An internal memo from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, regarding a release party, reads: \u201cThe projected sequences of events is: (1) Mr. Hutchins kicks off the conference with a discussion of the Great Books movement, and the university\u2019s and Britannica\u2019s interest in the set; (2) Mr. Adler tells in detail of the contents of the set and the significance of the Syntopicon; (3) Cocktails.\u201dColvin, James. Letter to C. Scott Fletcher. 12 Apr. 1950. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inter Office Correspondence. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL. The second edition of Great Books of the Western World contained six additional volumes of works from the twentieth century, like James Joyce, Max Weber, etc. The second edition of the Syntopicon added, to each of the articles on the great ideas, references to the works in the additional volumes and revisions to the introduction to each great idea to include some mention of how the given idea was understood by the twentieth-century authors in the collection. ==Purpose== In addition to being a \u201cspecial idea\u201d that would set Great Books of the Western World apart, the Syntopicon serves four other purposes, outlined in its preface. The Syntopicon can serve as a reference book, as a book to be read, as an \u201cinstrument of liberal education,\u201d and as \u201can instrument of discovery and research.\u201dAdler, Mortimer J. \"Syntopicon I Preface.\" Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1952. Above all, however, the Syntopicon was created to unite the western world's canon. It was created to solve what Adler saw as a fundamental problem, that \u201cdifferent authors say the same thing in different ways, or use the same words to say quite different things.\u201dAdler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. By cataloging the things the great authors were saying in a more scientific manner, Adler hoped to show the underlying unity that ultimately existed in the collected works. For Hutchins, a chief proponent of classical education, the creation of the Syntopicon held even greater implications. Hutchins felt that the ideas being discussed and cross-listed in the Syntopicon might be \"powerful enough to save the world from self- destruction.\"\"There are Only 102 Great Ideas.\" Look. Jan. 1948: 58\u201361. ==Content== The Syntopicon consists of 102 chapters on the 102 Great Ideas. Each chapter is broken down into five distinct sections: the introduction, an outline of topics, references, cross-references, and additional readings. Adler penned all 102 introductions himself, giving a brief essay on the idea and its connection with the western canon. The outline of topics broke each idea down further, into as many as 15 sub-ideas. For instance, the first idea \u201cAngel\u201d is broken down into \u201cInferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion,\u201d \u201cthe philosophical consideration of pure intelligences, spiritual substances, supra-human persons\u201d and seven other subtopics.\"Syntopicon I.\" Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1952. p. 9. After this is the references section (for instance, \u201cinferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion\u201d can be found in Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Locke, Hegel, Goethe and more). Cross-references follow, where similar ideas are listed. Last is the additional readings, in which one could seek out more on the subject of \u201cAngel.\u201d The list of 102 ideas is broken between the two volumes, as follows: Volume I: Angel, Animal, Aristocracy, Art, Astronomy, Beauty, Being, Cause, Chance, Change, Citizen, Constitution, Courage, Custom and Convention, Definition, Democracy, Desire, Dialectic, Duty, Education, Element, Emotion, Eternity, Evolution, Experience, Family, Fate, Form, God, Good and Evil, Government, Habit, Happiness, History, Honor, Hypothesis, Idea, Immortality, Induction, Infinity, Judgment, Justice, Knowledge, Labor, Language, Law, Liberty, Life and Death, Logic, and Love. Volume II: Man, Mathematics, Matter, Mechanics, Medicine, Memory and Imagination, Metaphysics, Mind, Monarchy, Nature, Necessity and Contingency, Oligarchy, One and Many, Opinion, Opposition,that which deals with the quality of sets of words that are opposite Philosophy, Physics, Pleasure and Pain, Poetry, Principle, Progress, Prophecy, Prudence, Punishment, Quality, Quantity, Reasoning, Relation,that which deals with what is \"relative\" to another object Religion, Revolution, Rhetoric, Same and Other, Science, Sense, Sign and Symbol, Sin, Slavery, Soul, Space, State, Temperance, Theology, Time, Truth, Tyranny and Despotism, Universal and Particular, Virtue and Vice, War and Peace, Wealth, Will, Wisdom, and World. ==Reactions== The release of the Syntopicon and the Great Books of the Western World was covered in the New York Herald, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Time magazine, the Chicago Tribune, and local papers across the United States. Full page ads for Time magazine appeared in newspapers across the country, saying \u201cWhat and Why is a Syntopicon?\u201d\"TIME Magazine.\" Advertisement. Chicago Daily News 20 Apr. 1950. Time published an article about the new, pivotal piece of reference material, and Adler wrote them back in thanks, saying that \u201cI think the piece is both thoroughly accurate and very lively, which, considering the subject matter, is quite a feat.\u201dMortimer, Adler J. Letter to Bruce Barton. 22 Apr. 1950. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL. Look magazine ran a feature on the Syntopicon, displaying behind-the-scene photos of the index's staff at work. In one picture, editor Joe Roddy is shown weighing the number of entries about love on a scale. \u201cDiscussions of love by great authors,\u201d the caption reads, \u201coutweigh sin and eternity.\u201d\"There are Only 102 Great Ideas.\" Look Jan. 1948: 58\u201361. Despite the extensive press coverage and cross-country speeches, however, sales of the Syntopicon and the Great Books of the Western World were slow. Experienced encyclopedia salesmen had to be brought in to move the product, despite Hutchins\u2019 dislike of this solution. The Syntopicon's list was \"arbitrary\", as even Adler admitted. The press and others also found problems with the Syntopicon, and despite Adler\u2019s predictions (\u201cwe predict that, as dictionaries are indispensable in the realm of words, and encyclopaedias in the realm of facts, so the Syntopicon will become indispensable in the realm of ideas\u201d ) the Syntopicon has fallen into relative obscurity. At the time of its release, The New York Times Book Review declared: \u201cIts defects are on the surface. One is the implication that great books are concerned only with ideas which can be logically analyzed\u2014whereas many masterpieces of literature live in realms partially or wholly outside the realm of logic. Another is the conception that the chief purpose of reading a book is to crack its shell and reach its kernel\u2014the form itself being unimportant decoration.\u201dHighet, Gilbert. \"The Great Ideas of the Western World.\" Rev. of Great Books of the Western World, by Mortimer J. Adler. New York Times Book Review 14 Sept. 1952. ==Subsequent books== In a succeeding book, Adler expressed his regret that the civil rights concept of Equality had not been selected. He attempted to rectify the omission with Six Great Ideas: Truth\u2013Goodness\u2013Beauty\u2013Liberty\u2013Equality\u2013Justice (1981). Adler attempted another index, in one volume, the Prop\u00e6dia for the fifteenth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. A traditional two-volume alphabetical index has since been produced for the more recent versions of the fifteenth edition, in addition to Prop\u00e6dia. The Syntopicon was republished as The Great Ideas: a Lexicon of Western Thought (1992), a single volume reprint of the commentary on all 102 ideas without including indexing and cross-reference to the Great Works. ==See also== * Great Conversation * Great books ==Notes== ==External links== * * Center for the Study of the Great Ideas - The Great Ideas * Center for the Study of the Great Ideas * Syntopicon volume 1 at Archive.org * Syntopicon volume 2 at Archive.org Category:Indexes Category:Lists of books ",
