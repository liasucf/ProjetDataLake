In the first turn of the race, Stewart Friesen brought out the caution after he got loose under Sheldon Creed and turned into the outside wall, also getting smacked by Anthony Alfredo. Friesen's truck was damaged to the point where he could not continue, ultimately ending his day before completing a single lap. Alfredo was only able to complete two more laps before his day also ended. On the restart, Bryan Dauzat spun and immediately brought out the caution again. Chastain dominated and won stage 1. Hill had engine problems on lap 22 and was forced to park his truck in the garage. Chastain pitted with 3 laps remaining in stage 2, giving the stage win to Harrison Burton. Chastain regained the lead after Burton pitted, and was never challenged again during the race. He won the race ahead of Tyler Ankrum, dedicating the race win to late crew chief Nick Harrison, who had died a week before the race. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 15 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- !
