    "text": "Osceola is an unincorporated community in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States. The community is located NW of Covington, Louisiana. Ella B. Hughes wrote that in 1888 a post office was built in Husser, Louisiana and just a few years later a second post office was built a few miles to the south and was called Viola. The area was renamed Osceola just a few years later. ==Etymology== The name of the community is derived from an ancient native american ritual dating back to the Archaic period. The Muscogee people would perform a ritual they called \u00e1ssi which means black drink and yahola which means \"shouting man\" or \"singer\". There was also a very influential leader of the Seminole people from Florida named Osceola that was given this name. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Louisiana ",
