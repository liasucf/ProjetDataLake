    "text": "The 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship (also known as UEFA Under-21 Euro 2019) was the 22nd edition of the UEFA European Under-21 Championship (25th edition if the Under-23 era is also included), the biennial international youth football championship organised by UEFA for the men's under-21 national teams of Europe. The final tournament was hosted by Italy (and some matches by San Marino) in mid-2019, after their bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee on 9 December 2016 in Nyon, Switzerland. A total of 12 teams played in the tournament, with players born on or after 1 January 1996 eligible to participate. Same as previous Under-21 Championships that were held one year prior to the Olympics, this tournament served as European qualifying for the Olympic football tournament, with the top four teams of the tournament qualifying for the 2020 Summer Olympic men's football tournament in Japan, where they will be represented by their under-23 national teams with maximum of three overage players allowed. The four teams that qualified for the Olympic Games were the ones that qualified for the knockout stages of this championship. For the first time, the video assistant referee (VAR) system was used at the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Germany were the defending champions. ==Hosts== The Italian Football Federation confirmed that Italy would bid to host the tournament in 2019, which also involved the San Marino Football Federation. Italy and San Marino were appointed as hosts at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Nyon on 9 December 2016.LA UEFA ASSEGNA ALL\u2019ITALIA E SAN MARINO L\u2019EUROPEO UNDER 21 DEL 2019. FEDERAZIONE SAMMARINESE GIUOCO CALCIO. 9 Dicembre 2016 ==Qualification== All 55 UEFA nations entered the competition, and with the hosts Italy qualifying automatically (the other co-hosts San Marino would not qualify automatically), the other 54 teams competed in the qualifying competition to determine the remaining 11 spots in the final tournament. The qualifying competition, which took place from March 2017 to November 2018, consisted of two rounds: *Qualifying group stage: The 54 teams were drawn into nine groups of six teams. Each group was played in home-and-away round-robin format. The nine group winners qualified directly for the final tournament, while the four best runners-up (not counting results against the sixth-placed team) advanced to the play-offs. *Play-offs: The four teams were drawn into two ties to play home-and-away two-legged matches to determine the last two qualified teams. ===Qualified teams=== The following teams qualified for the final tournament.

England were ineligible for the Olympics as they are not an Olympic nation (while an agreement was reached between the four British football associations to enter the Great Britain women's team, no agreement was reached for the men's team). Had they reached the semi-finals, the last Olympic spot would have gone to the winner of an Olympic play-off match, tentatively scheduled to be played at Stadio Dino Manuzzi, Cesena on 28 June 2019, 21:00 CEST, between the two group runners-up which did not qualify for the semi-finals. However, when England failed to advance out of the group stage, this match was cancelled. == International broadcasters == === Television === All 21 matches were live streamed for the unsold markets via UEFA.tv and highlights were also available for all territories around the world via the UEFA YouTube channel. ==== Participating nations ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Country ! colspan=\"2\" |Broadcaster |- !Free !Pay |- |' (host)' |RAI | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |ORF | |- | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Sport1 |- | rowspan=\"3\" | |- |ARD | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |ZDF |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |VRT (Dutch) | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |RTBF (French) |- | |HRT | |- | |DR | |- | |M6 |beIN Sports |- | |TVP | |- | |TVR | |- | |RTS | |- | |Mediaset | |- | | |Sky Sports |} ==== Non- participating European nations ==== {| class=\"wikitable hlist\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Country/Region ! colspan=\"2\" |Broadcaster |- !Free !Pay |- | |RTSH | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |Mediaset (Spanish) | rowspan=\"5\" |beIN Sports (French) |- | rowspan=\"2\" |M6 (French) |- | rowspan=\"3\" | |- |RTBF (French) |- |VRT (Dutch) |- | |APMTV | |- | |Belteleradio | |- | |BHRT | |- | |BNT | |- | |\u010cT | |- | |ERR | |- | |DR | |- | |Yle | |- | |ERT | |- | |MTVA | |- | |RT\u00c9 |Sky Sports |- | |Charlton | |- | |RTK | |- | |LTV | |- | | rowspan=\"2\" |SRG SSR (German, French, and Italian) | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Sport1 (German) |- | |LRT | |- | |PBS | |- | |RTCG | |- | |NOS | |- | |NRK | |- | |RTP | |- | | colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Match TV |- | | rowspan=\"2\" |RAI | |- | | |- | |RTVS | |- | |RTV SLO | |- | |SVT | |- | |TRT | |- | |UA:PBC | |} ==== Outside Europe ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Country/Region ! colspan=\"2\" |Broadcaster |- !Free !Pay |- | |CCTV |Super Sports |- | |Super Soccer TV | |- | | |Wowow |- | * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | | rowspan=\"2\" | * ESPN * Univision (Puerto Rico and USA only) |- | |Univision (Puerto Rico and USA only) |- | * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | |beIN Sports |} === Radio === ==== Participating nations ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Country !Broadcaster |- |' (host)' |RAI |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |ORF |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Sport1 |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |ARD |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |VRT (Dutch) |- |RTBF (French) |- | |HRT |- | |DR |- | |PR |- | |RR |- | |RTS |- | |Marca |- | |Talksport |} ==== Non-participating European nations ==== {| class=\"wikitable hlist\" !Country/Region !Broadcaster |- | |RTSH |- | | rowspan=\"2\" |RTBF (French) |- | |- | |HR |- | |Belteleradio |- | |BHRT |- | |BNR |- | |\u010cR |- | |ERR |- | |DR |- | |Yle |- | |ERT |- | |MTVA |- | |RT\u00c9 |- | |RTK |- | |LR |- | | rowspan=\"2\" |SRG SSR (German, French, and Italian) |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Sport1 (German) |- | |LRT |- | |PBS |- | |RTCG |- | |NOS |- | |NRK |- | |RTP |- | | rowspan=\"2\" |RAI |- | |- | |RTVS |- | |RTV SLO |- | |SR |- | |TRT |- | |UA:PBC |} ==== Outside Europe ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Country/Region !Broadcaster |- | |CRI |- | * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | rowspan=\"2\" | * ESPN * Univision (Puerto Rico and USA only) |- | |} == References == ==External links== * *2019 U21 EURO final tournament: Italy, UEFA.com 2019 Under-21 Championship Category:International association football competitions hosted by Italy Category:2018\u201319 in Italian football Category:2019 in youth association football Category:2018\u201319 in San Marino football Category:International association football competitions hosted by San Marino Category:June 2019 sports events in Europe Uefa ",
