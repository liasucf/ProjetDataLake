    "text": "Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1772\u20131843) was a French professional fortune- teller of considerable fame during the Napoleonic era. In France, Lenormand is considered the greatest cartomancer of all time, highly influential on the wave of French cartomancy that began in the late 18th century. == Early life == Lenormand was born on 27 May 1772 in Alen\u00e7on, Normandy, to Jean Louis Antoine Lenormand, a draper, and Marie Anne Lenormand (n\u00e9e Gilbert). Lenormand was orphaned at the age of five and educated in a convent school. Lenormand left Alen\u00e7on for Paris in 1786. ==Career== Lenormand claimed to have given cartomantic advice to many famous persons, among them leaders of the French Revolution (Marat, Robespierre and St-Just), Empress Josephine and Tsar Alexander I. She was active for more than 40 years. In 1814 Lenormand started a second literary career and published many texts, causing many public controversies. She was imprisoned more than once, though never for very long. == Death == Lenormand died in Paris on 25 June 1843 and is buried in Division 3 of P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. She left behind a fortune of 500,000 Francs, and left no heirs other than a nephew who, at the time of her death, was in the army.The Illustrated London News, 1 July 1843. A devout Catholic, her nephew burned all of Mme. Lenormand's occult paraphernalia; taking only the monetary fortune that she left behind. == Works == * Les souvenirs proph\u00e9tiques d'une sibylle sur les causes secr\u00e9tes de son arrestation - Paris (1814) (592 pages) * Anniversaire de la mort de l'imp\u00e9ratrice Josephine (1815) * La sibylle au tombeau de Louis XVI (1816) * Les oracles sibyllins ou la suite des souvenirs proph\u00e9tiques - Paris (1817) (528 pages) * La sibylle au congr\u00e8s d'Aix-la- Chapelle (1819) (316 pages) * M\u00e9moires historiques et secrets de l'imp\u00e9ratrice Jos\u00e9phine, Marie-Rose Tascher-de-la-Pagerie, premi\u00e8re \u00e9pouse de Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte - Paris (1820) (556 pages) * M\u00e9moire justificatif pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Mlle Le Normand (1821) (20 pages) * Cri de l'honneur (1821) (18 pages) * Souvenirs de la Belgique - Cent jours d'infortunes o\u00f9 le proc\u00e8s m\u00e9morable (1822) (416 pages) * L'ange protecteur de la France au tombeau de Louis XVIII (1824) * L'ombre immortelle de Catherine II au tombeau d'Alexandre Ier (1826) * L'ombre de Henri IV au palais d'Orl\u00e9ans (1830) (107 pages) * Le petit homme rouge au ch\u00e2teau des Tuileries - Paris (1831) (107 pages) * Manifeste des dieux sur les affaires de France (1832) (60 pages) * Arr\u00eat supr\u00eame des dieux de l'Olympe en faveur de Mme. la duchesse de Berry et de son fils (1833) (144 pages) Possibly author of * Histoire de Jean VI. de Portugal, depuis sa naissance jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort en 1826. - Paris : Ponthieu, 1827 == Lenormand cards == A Lenormand card based on a deck from 1854 After Lenormand's death her name was used on several cartomancy decks including a deck of 36 illustrated cards known as the Petit Lenormand or simply Lenormand cards still used extensively today.
