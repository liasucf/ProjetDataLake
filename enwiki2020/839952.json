He is the lead guitarist, and also one of the founding members, of the Welsh/American rock band No Devotion and previously a member of the Welsh rock band Lostprophets. ==Career== Gaze was born in Pontypridd, Wales. He grew up on a council estate in Rhydyfelin, Pontypridd. Gaze did not do well at school, he was more interested in playing thrash metal: as he told Kerrang! in 2006, \u201c Before I discovered music, I was a total delinquent, and then Iron Maiden changed my life\". Gaze formed his first band, Aftermath, along with Ian Watkins in 1991. They recorded one demo \u2018Discontent\u2019 and in 1994 they joined forces with two other local musicians and formed Fleshbind. The band recorded three demos and saw some success in their three year career, including playing a show for Metal Hammer at The Astoria in London. Tired with the lack of direction, Gaze and Watkins disbanded Fleshbind and formed Lostprophets, along with Mike Chaplin on drums. Later recruiting Mike Lewis, Stuart Richardson and Jamie Oliver. Gaze was the lead guitarist and one of the key songwriters. Lostprophets disbanded in October 2013 after Watkins was charged with (and ultimately convicted of) child sexual offences. Gaze and the remaining members later formed a new band, No Devotion, with Geoff Rickly as lead singer. Richardson, Gaze and Rickly have been working on their sophomore album which is penned for a 2019 release. ==Discography== == References == Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pontypridd Category:Welsh guitarists Category:Welsh rock musicians Category:Welsh rock guitarists Category:Lead guitarists Category:Lostprophets members Category:21st-century guitarists Category:No Devotion members ",
