One of the biggest NHS trusts in the country, it serves a population of 1.2 million people and has an annual revenue of over \u00a3850m. == History == The trust was established on 1 April 2020 following the merger of three existing NHS trusts: Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust and Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. An initial merger between the 3 trusts was first agreed in January 2018. This came after a number of proposals from the Mid and South Essex Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) regarding reconfiguring services provided in the area. In October 2018 the plan was referred by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. On 31 July 2019 the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care endorsed the merger and a provisional date of 1 April 2020 was agreed. == Hospitals == The trust runs three major hospitals: * Basildon University Hospital in Basildon * Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford * Southend University Hospital in Southend-on-Sea The trust also runs community hospitals including Braintree Community Hospital and St Peter's Hospital. == See also == * Healthcare in Essex * List of NHS trusts == References == == External links == * * Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust on the NHS website * Inspection reports from the Care Quality Commission Category:NHS foundation trusts Category:Organisations based in Essex ",
