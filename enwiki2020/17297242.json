The school's playing fields were subsequently subdivided for a housing estate; the Tudor-style main building was purchased by a group who transformed it into the Qualicum College Inn. In the mid-1970s, the Inn was the main location for It Happened at Lakewood Manor, a made-for- television film that premiered in December 1977. The hotel owner had sought permission to redevelop the property as a 90-unit residential condominium in 2007 but the application was withdrawn. Demolition of additions to the building added in the 1970s began in January 2008.
