The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate in January 2012. ==Reception== Bob Calhoun of Salon.com wrote that Sorbo \"sinks to sad new lows\" after starring in the film. Scott Weinberg of Twitch Film called it \"one of the worst films I've ever seen.\" Weinberg said that it is \"the sort of movie that makes you reconsider Uwe Boll's status as the reigning king of movie crap.\" eFilm critic Jack Sommersby writes, while rating the film one star \"What's infuriating is that Pyun has oodles of talent and can be a first-rate director when he allows himself to be guided by ratiocination rather than egregious grandeur. The Sword and the Sorcerer didn't exactly have the sturdiest of scripts, which resulted in a lumpy middle section, but it was all of a piece, a consistent vision -- for my money, far better than John Boorman's clunky Excalibur from the year before.\"http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=23346&reviewer;=327 \"Nick Hartel of DVD Talk rated it 0/5 stars and also called Pyun worse than Boll, whom he called merely lazy rather than incompetent like Pyun. Scott Pyle of Fulvue Drive-In.com writes, \"Empire tries very hard to follow the happy-go- lucky spirit of its predecessor, and it manages to succeed at this on some level, but it lacks the innocence and pure fun of Sorcerer.\"http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/11431/ David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote that the film's only redeeming quality is that it is \"laughably short.\" While giving the film one star and Jason Rugart says \"it end up on worst list next December\" but goes on to write, \"Pyun has an excellent eye for the visually intriguing and his love for the craft palpable. That's the thing that makes Tales such a frustrating viewing experience is that elements of a good movie or at least a watchable one are swimming about in this murky haphazard concoction.\"http://moviemavericks.com/2012/01/abelar-tales-of-an- ancient-empire-2010-review/ ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010 films Category:2010s fantasy films Category:2010 independent films Category:American films Category:American fantasy films Category:American independent films Category:American sequel films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Albert Pyun Category:Sword and sorcery films Category:Vampires in film ",
