    "text": "Encephalitis Society is a UK registered charity with worldwide reach which provides support and information for those affected and collaborates on research into encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. The charity's vision is a world aware of encephalitis, its consequences and the support available. The Encephalitis Society provides support to individuals and families whose lives have been touched by encephalitis. The Society offers comprehensive and accredited information about the signs, symptoms and causes of encephalitis in children and adults and the outcomes of this devastating condition. The Encephalitis Society promotes and collaborates research into all aspects of this little known condition. It also raises awareness of encephalitis among the public and medical and health professionals. == History == The Encephalitis Society was founded in 1994 by a group of parents whose children had been affected by the condition. They found that information about encephalitis and support for people affected and their families was virtually non-existent. == Activities == Today, The Encephalitis Society provides support and information to people affected by encephalitis, directly or indirectly, and to a variety of professionals and organisations from health, social care and education globally. The Society holds weekends for families, and adult retreats and has also developed a global volunteer scheme called Team Encephalitis. The Society has a comprehensive resource of evidence-based, peer reviewed, award-winning and accredited information comprising factsheets, books, booklets, leaflets, DVDs and newsletters, available in both hard copy and electronically. Awareness of encephalitis is raised through events such as World Encephalitis Day which was founded by the Society in 2014 and through fundraising events. The Society collaborates and funds research into encephalitis and its consequences and holds an annual conference on the condition as well as annual competitions and travel bursaries for medical students and junior physicians. The charity works in partnership with other neurological charities, health organisations, at national and international level to ensure people affected by the condition are diagnosed quickly and have access to services that will contribute to their recovery and rehabilitation. In September 2017, it was named the Charity Times Charity of the Year: with an income less than \u00a31 million. == World Encephalitis Day == The Society launched the first World Encephalitis Day on 22 February 2014. In the years that followed, this annual global awareness day has become the most important date on the calendar for the Society and for people affected by encephalitis around the world. The fourth annual World Encephalitis Day on 22 February 2017, reached an estimated 40 million people through traditional and social media and saw over 50 global landmarks go #RED4WED by lighting up in the colour red. These included Niagara Falls, the fountains at Trafalgar Square, the Swan Bell Tower, Perth, Blackpool Tower and Bolivia Triplet Bridges. == Information == The Society has several ambassadors from the world of sport, television, journalism and music. * Rebecca Adlington * Mathew Bose * Tonia Buxton * Susannah Cahalan * Aliki Chrysochou * Simon Hattenstone * Charlotte Leeming === Scientific Advisory Panel === The Scientific Advisory Panel provides The Society with expert professional resources.
