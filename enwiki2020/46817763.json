    "text": "MicroBooNE is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) at Fermilab in Batavia, IL. It is located in the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) beamline where neutrinos are produced by colliding protons from Fermilab's booster- accelerator to a beryllium target; this produces many short-lived particles that decay into neutrinos. The neutrinos then pass through solid ground (to filter out particles that are not neutrinos from the beam) through another experiment called ANNIE (under construction as of 2018), then solid ground, then through the Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND, in development, expected to begin operation 2020), then ground again and arrive at the MicroBooNE detector 470 meters downrange from the target. After MicroBooNE the neutrinos continue to MiniBooNE detector and to the ICARUS detector. MicroBooNE's two main physics goals are to investigate the MiniBooNE low-energy excess and neutrino-argon cross sections. It will be part of a series of neutrino detectors along with the new Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) and moved ICARUS detector. MicroBooNE was filled with argon in July 2015 and began data taking. The collaboration announced that they had found evidence of the experiment's first neutrino interactions in November 2015. As of 2018, the detector was operating.http://sbn.fnal.gov/ == References == ==External links== * Category:Neutrino experiments Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments Category:Fermilab Category:Fermilab experiments ",
