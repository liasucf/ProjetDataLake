    "text": "George Thomas Doo (6 January 1800 \u2013 13 November 1886) was an English engraver. ==Life== Doo was born near Christ Church in Southwark, London. His teacher was Charles Heath. In 1825 he went to Paris. There he studied in the atelier of Suisse, and also attended the school of Gros, according to Thompson Cooper; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests his study under Charles- Alexandre Suisse might have been later. He acquired the techniques of drawing from the life, and passed them on to pupils in England.Thompson Cooper, Men of the Time: a dictionary of contemporaries, containing biographical notices of eminent characters of both sexes (1884) p. 348;archive.org.Clara Clement, Artists of the Nineteenth Century and Their Works: A Handbook Containing Two Thousand and Fifty Biographical Sketches Volume 1 (2010 reprint), p. 211; Google Books. He took on William Duffield as a non-paying pupil, and William Thomas Roden was an apprentice. Another pupil was Thomas Leeming Grundy. In 1836 Doo was made Engraver in Ordinary to William IV, and later to Queen Victoria. At this period he worked for Francis Moon. Doo became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. He was made a Royal Academician in 1857. Doo died in Sutton, Surrey. ==Works== In 1824 he published his first plate, after a portrait of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany by Thomas Lawrence. The Combat Portrait of Georges Cuvier after the painting by Henry William Pickersgill Doo's more well-known works include his 1848 line-engraving The Combat after William Etty's painting from 1825. He is also known for his engraving of \"Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation,\" after David Wilkie, \"Italian Pilgrims coming in sight of Rome\" after Eastlake, the \"Infant Christ\" after Raphael and the \"Ecce Homo\" after Correggio. His 1864 engraving of the \"Raising of Lazarus\" by Sebastiano del Piombo took him eight years. ==References== *Royal Society profile ==External links== * * *WorldCat page *CERL page * Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections Category:1800 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People from Surrey Category:English engravers Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Royal Academicians ",
