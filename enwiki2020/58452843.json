    "text": "Raumbild-Verlag (\"Raumbild\") was a German publishing outfit which focused exclusively on stereoscopic imagery, usually accompanied by expository text. Founded in Die\u00dfen in the 1930s by Otto Wilhelm Sch\u00f6nstein (1891\u20131958), Raumbild produced 6x13cm photographic stereo pairs designed to be used with the proprietary fold-out \"Photoplastikon\" viewer produced for the company, some of which featured Zeiss Jena lenses. Quickly aligning itself with the propaganda arm of the NSDAP, Raumbild moved around several times before settling in Munich in 1939.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/fotografen/schoenstein.html After the defeat of Germany in the Second World War, Raumbild changed directions in terms of content, while still focusing on subjects relevant to German identity. In 1996, the German Historical Museum obtained the remaining archives of Raumbild, which are now available to researchers.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/vorwort.html == Founder == Otto Wilhelm Sch\u00f6nstein was born in N\u00fcrnberg in 1891, and in his early life became a textile merchant.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/fotografen/schoenstein.html He was fascinated by stereoscopic photography, and in his early 40s he decided to transition from hobbyist into professional purveyor of stereoscopic images. After the Second World War, Sch\u00f6nstein was tried and released for his complicity in Nazi propaganda; he lived in relative obscurity, publishing new 6x13cm stereoview sets under pseudonyms until his death in 1958.https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2013/08/30/1008/ == Establishment, early efforts, and association with Nazism == Sch\u00f6nstein incorporated Raumbild on 14 January 1935.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte.html Although his first publishing efforts were failures due to negative reviews from Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums, his later work with Raumbild throughout the mid-1930s and through the mid 1940s was very popular in Germany. The country was swept up in nationalistic fervor; Sch\u00f6nstein would capitalize on this in his works after changing his focus from travel photography to Germanic subjects. He quickly came to the attention of the Nazi Party, and his company became a de facto photographic arm of the Propaganda Ministry of the Party. This association led to unprecedented access for Sch\u00f6nstein and his employees and collaborators, beginning with the 1936 Summer Olympics in which he collaborated with Leni Riefenstahl. The resulting book & stereograph collection, Die Olympischen Spiele, was a commercial success, at which point Heinrich Hoffmann, Adolf Hitler's personal photographer, became a silent partner with a 50% stake in Raumbild for a 5,000 RM initial investment and a 10,000 RM loan.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte1.html Hoffmann became the official photographer, while Sch\u00f6nstein \u2013 regarded as an inferior lensman \u2013 curated and produced the various sets released by the company. This partnership cemented a longstanding relationship between Raumbild and the Third Reich which lasted until the end of the Second World War, although production of new materials ceased in 1942 as the war efforts made continuing photography difficult. == Postwar activities == After the war, Raumbild stopped producing materials related to the NSDAP. During denazification, which continued until 1953, Sch\u00f6nstein continued to create photographs and photographic sets; after a 6-month probationary period in 1946 related to his collusion with the Third Reich, Raumbild resumed production.http://www.stereoskopie.com/Raumbildbaende/Otto_Schonstein/body_otto_schonstein.html Sch\u00f6nstein produced sets with the intention of selling to American occupying forces; this provided the bulk of his income for the remainder of his life.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte5.html In 1951, most of Sch\u00f6nstein's assets were seized as a judgement against his actions during the War; nevertheless, he would produce one of his final major works through Raumbild, covering the 1952 Olympics. During this period, Raumbild was primarily publishing the works of other photographers, primarily in color, and the subject matter ranged from landscapes to architecture to nudes. In early 1958, Raumbild was declared defunct, and Sch\u00f6nstein would have to sell; the company passed to Siegfried Brandm\u00fcller, a former employee of Sch\u00f6nstein's who would run the company for the next 27 years. The 23-year-old Brandm\u00fcller kept Sch\u00f6nstein on as an employee, which greatly embarrassed the former Raumbild giant; he would die just six months later. After a few initial successes by Brandm\u00fcller, Raumbild went dormant for a long time, although a number of attempts were made to re-launch the company; all of these failed.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte6.html Raumbild folded for good in the mid-1980s. The Raumbild archives (outside of those seized by the American government and now in the public domain) changed hands a number of times and are now owned by the German Historical Museum. == Publications == It is difficult to produce a definitive list of Raumbild's output, as some works were produced in extremely small editions, and numerous smaller manufacturers attached the Raumbild name to unauthorized sets not actually affiliated with the company. Below is a partial list of known works produced by Raumbild- Verlag.https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/biblio.htmlhttp://www.stereoskopie.com/Raumbildbaende/Raumbildband_Schoenstein_/body_raumbildband_schoenstein_.html Because Raumbild views are designed for a specific type of viewer, they cannot be directly transposed into anaglyphs; some cropping is required. === Early works === * 1935, Venedig, ein Raumerlebnis (\"Venice, a space experience\"), a travel series on Venice, which was rejected by the NDSAP Propaganda Ministry Photographers: Sch\u00f6nstein, Kurt Lothar Tank * 1935, Unnamed series on Rome and the Vatican, never completed === Nazi propaganda === * 1936, Die Olympischen Spiele (\"The Olympic Games\"), a 100-card set & book featuring the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the Winter Olympics and Chess Olympiad.
