    "text": "Once in a While is the fifth studio album by Seth MacFarlane, released on April 19, 2019, by Republic Records and Verve Records. The record was primarily produced by Joel McNeely and MacFarlane himself, who also serves as the executive producer. The lead single from the album, \"Half As Lovely (Twice As True)\", was released digitally on April 11, 2019. ==Background== On March 8, 2019, MacFarlane revealed on his Twitter account that he had just finished recording his new album at Abbey Road Studios. It was also announced that for the first time, MacFarlane would be working with Andrew Cottee as the composer and arranger instead of Joel McNeely, however he still remained a producer for the album. MacFarlane has a close relationship with the composer, since meeting on the 2016 animated musical film Sing and later working together on The Orville. MacFarlane described the album as a moody style of Sinatra's signature albums. \"I love the ballad album, the rich, melancholy songs,\" MacFarlane said. \"You're taking a theme or a mood or a tone or an emotion and assembling a set list where everything lives in that space, so when you put it on, you're spending the 60 minutes or however long the album is immersed in that one emotion.\" Cottee also described the album as \"not necessarily sad break-up songs. They're more reflective, thoughtful, even philosophical, but they're not all torch songs.\" == Critical reception == The Straits Times gave the album a positive review while also saying that MacFarlane should shake things up to make his music more fresh. Jazz Weeklys George W. Harris praised the album and MacFarlane himself, saying, \"but it wouldn't work unless MacFarlane didn't have a strong enough voice to convince, and he does. He sounds convincing, assured and personal.\" ==Track listing== == Personnel == Credits adapted from AllMusic. * Jonathan Aasgaard \u2013 Cello *John Anderson \u2013 Oboe *John Barrett \u2013 Assistant Engineer *Chuck Berghofer \u2013 Bass *Irving Berlin \u2013 Composer *Anna-Liisa Bezrodny \u2013 Violin *Adrian Bradbury \u2013 Cello *Rich Breen \u2013 Engineer, Mixing *Benjamin Buckton \u2013 Violin *Sammy Cahn \u2013 Composer *Gordon Campbell \u2013 Trombone *Rebecca Chambers \u2013 Viola *Corinne Chappelle \u2013 Violin *Stephano Civetta \u2013 Assistant Engineer *Dave Collins \u2013 Mastering *Betty Comden \u2013 Composer *Andrew Cottee \u2013 Arranger, Conductor *Kris Crawford \u2013 Assistant Engineer *Tom Croxon \u2013 Orchestra Contractor *Hannah Dawson \u2013 Violin *Rudi DeGroote \u2013 Cello *Shlomy Dobrinsky \u2013 Violin *Kira Doherty \u2013 French Horn *Pierre Doumenge \u2013 Cello *Dream Town Orchestra \u2013 Orchestration *Clare Duckworth \u2013 Violin *Michael Edwards \u2013 Composer *Peter Erskine \u2013 Drums *Joy Fehily \u2013 Executive Producer *Carl Fischer \u2013 Composer *Sammy Gallop \u2013 Composer *Ian Gibbs \u2013 Violin *Tim Gibbs \u2013 Bass *Thomas Goodman \u2013 Bass *Mark Graham \u2013 Music Preparation *Peter Graham \u2013 Violin *Adolph Green \u2013 Composer *Bud Green \u2013 Composer *Thelma Handy \u2013 Violin *Philip Harmer \u2013 Oboe *Lorenz Hart \u2013 Composer *Andrew Harvey \u2013 Violin *Richard Harwood \u2013 Cello *Oliver Heath \u2013 Violin *Cormac Henry \u2013 Flute *Dan Higgins \u2013 Clarinet, Sax (Alto) *Jeremy Isaac \u2013 Violin *Maya Iwabuchi \u2013 Violin *Paul James \u2013 Composer *Magnus Johnston \u2013 Violin *Cerys Jones \u2013 Violin *Francis Kefford \u2013 Viola *Liam Kirkman \u2013 Trombone *Larry Koonse \u2013 Guitars *Nicholas Korth \u2013 French Horn *Frankie Laine \u2013 Composer *Dunja Lavrova \u2013 Violin *Peggy Lee \u2013 Composer *Mike Lovatt \u2013 Trumpet *James Lynch \u2013 Trumpet *Seth MacFarlane \u2013 Art Direction, Liner Notes, Primary Artist, Producer, Vocals *Ciaran McCabe \u2013 Violin *Joel McNeely \u2013 Producer *Johnny Mercer \u2013 Composer *John Mills \u2013 Violin *Kate Musker \u2013 Viola *Alex Neal \u2013 Percussion *Benjamin Newton \u2013 Viola *Peter North \u2013 Trombone *Simon Oliver \u2013 Bass *John Parricelli \u2013 Guitars *Fiona Paterson \u2013 Flute *Julie Pryce \u2013 Bassoon *Matthew Quenby \u2013 Viola *Tom Ranier \u2013 Piano *Edward C.
