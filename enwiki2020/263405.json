Originally inhabitants of much of Chihuahua, the Rar\u00e1muri retreated to the high sierras and canyons such as the Copper Canyon in the Sierra Madre Occidental on the arrival of Spanish immigrants in the 16th century.Pennington, Campbell W. (1963) The Tarahumar of Mexico, their environment and material culture. University of Utah Press. The area of the Sierra Madre Occidental which they now inhabit is often called the Sierra Tarahumara because of their presence. Estimates put the Rar\u00e1muri population in 2006 at between 50,000 and 70,000 people. Most still practise a traditional lifestyle, including inhabiting natural shelters (caves or cliff overhangs). Staple crops are corn and beans; however, many of the Rar\u00e1muri still practise transhumance, raising cattle, sheep, and goats. Almost all Rar\u00e1muri migrate from one place to another during the course of a year. The Rar\u00e1muri language belongs to the Uto-Aztecan family. Although it is in decline under pressure from Spanish, it is still widely spoken. In the Rar\u00e1muri language, the endonymic term rar\u00e1muri refers specifically to the men; women are referred to as muk\u00ed (individually), and as omug\u00ed or ig\u00f3male (collectively). ==History== The Rar\u00e1muri are believed to be descended from a people of the Mogollon culture. The Rar\u00e1muri repulsed and were never conquered by the Spanish conquistadors or fully converted by the Jesuit missionaries. When the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, they called this native people the \"Tarahumara\". By the early 17th century, the Spanish had established mines in Tarahumara territory and made some slave raids to obtain workers for the mines. Jesuit Juan Fonte established a mission, San Pablo Balleza, at the southern end of Tarahumara territory, expanding from missionary work with the Tepehuan to the south. The Tepehuan's violent resistance to Spanish incursion in the Tepehuan revolt of 1616 killed Fonte and seven other Jesuit missionaries, closing the mission for over a decade. The discovery of the mines of Parral, Chihuahua, in 1631 increased Spanish presence in Tarahumara lands, bringing more slave raids and Jesuit missionaries. Missions were established at Las Bocas, Huejotitlan, San Felipe and Satevo.Spicer, pp. 25\u201329 In 1648, the Tarahumara waged war against the Spanish. They gathered at Fariagic and then destroyed the mission of San Francisco de Borja. Two of the leaders of this attack were captured by the Spanish and executed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish established Villa de Aguilar in the heart of the upper Tarahumara country. From then on, the Tarahumara split into two groups. Those in the lower missions continued to move into the general Christian population and largely lost their tribal identity. Those in the upper areas went to war under the leadership of Tep\u00f3raca and others, driving the Jesuits and Spanish settlers from the area. The Jesuits returned in the 1670s and baptized thousands of Tarahumara, but these people retained a separate identity. Tep\u00f3raca was executed by the Spanish in 1690.Spicer, pp. 30\u201333 From 1696 to 1698, the Tarahumara again waged war against the Spanish, but were defeated. An important 1691 Jesuit report concerned the resistance of the Tarahumara to evangelization, Historia de la tercera rebeli\u00f3n tarahumara.Tom\u00e1s de Guadalajara (?), Historia de la tercera rebeli\u00f3n tarahumara. Roberto Ramos, ed. Chihuahua 1950.J. Benedict Warren, \"An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818,entry 107. \"Jesuit Missions in Northwestern Mexico\" in Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources. Howard F. Cline, volume editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p. 95. By 1753, the Jesuits turned over the lower Tarahumara missions to secular priests, and in 1767 the Jesuits were expelled in Spanish territories. Most missions in Tarahumara country ceased to operateSpicer, p. 37 or were turned over to Franciscans. Despite devoted and enthusiastic efforts, the Franciscans could not match the Jesuits\u2019 feats, and the missions declined. The Jesuits reestablished the missions in the early 20th century. == Culture == === Athletic skills === The Tarahumara word for themselves, Rar\u00e1muri, means \"runners on foot\" or \"those who run fast\" in their native tongue according to some early ethnographers like Norwegian Carl Lumholtz, though this interpretation has not been fully agreed upon. With widely dispersed settlements, these people developed a tradition of long-distance running up to in one session, over a period of two days through their homeland of rough canyon country, for inter-village communication, transportation, and hunting.Irigoyen, Fructuoso and Manuel Palma, Jesus (1995). Raraj\u00edpari, the Tarahumara Indian Kick-ball Race. La Prensa. The Tarahumara's use of huaraches, a traditional form of minimal footwear, when running has been the subject of scientific study, as well as journalistic discourse. In his book, Born to Run, author Christopher McDougall argues in favor of the endurance running hypothesis and the barefoot running movement based on his time with the Tarahumara people and their running in huaraches. The long-distance running tradition also has ceremonial and competitive aspects. Often, men kick wooden balls as they run in \"foot throwing\", rarajipari, competitions, and women use a stick and hoop. The foot throwing races are relays where the balls are kicked by the runners and relayed to the next runner while teammates run ahead to the next relay point. These races can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days without a break. The Tarahumara commonly hunt with bow and arrows, but are also known for their ability to run down deer and wild turkeys. Anthropologist Jonathan F. Cassel describes the Tarahumaras\u2019 hunting abilities: \"the Tarahumara literally run the birds to death in what is referred to as persistence hunting. Forced into a rapid series of takeoffs, without sufficient rest periods between, the heavy-bodied bird does not have the strength to fly or run away from the Tarahumara hunter.\" === Religious beliefs === The Rar\u00e1muri religion is a m\u00e9lange of indigenous customs and Roman Catholicism. During the late 1600s and early 1700s, there was strong Jesuit mission activity, which was met by resistance. Later, when the Jesuit order was expelled, the Rar\u00e1muri were left free to interpret, modify, maintain or promulgate Catholic beliefs, symbols and practices with little outside intervention . While native religious elements have been maintained, there are Spanish Catholic ritual elements, demonstrating \"a genuine integration with vital cultural interests\". The beings of most importance are: God (Riosi), God's wife, who is the Christian Virgin Mary transformed, and the devil (Riablo). Riosi is thought to be the indigenous deity Onoruame (\"Great Father\"), and the Virgin Mary is Iyeruame (\"Great Mother\"). The indigenous counterparts of Father-Sun and Mother Moon overlap, respectively, with these concepts of God and God's wife. Another reported variation is that God has a wife who lives with him in heaven, along with their sons, the so-called sukristo (from Spanish Jesucristo) and their daughters, the santi. These beings have a direct link with the physical world through Catholic iconography, crucifixes and saints\u2019 medallions, respectively. Although Riablo aligns with the devil, the Rar\u00e1muri do not believe in a being that embodies Evil wholly. Instead it is tainted through its ties with the Chabochi (non- Rar\u00e1muri). The Devil is said to sometimes collaborate with God to arrange fitting punishments and can be appeased through sacrifices. In some cases, the Devil can be persuaded to act as a benevolent entity. Some Rar\u00e1muri religious practices have the sense of konema (i.e., feeding God), the sense of returning to God a little of the much that he has given is prevalent. Some Tarahumaras maintain a belief that the afterlife is a mirror image of the mortal world and that good deeds should be performed\u2014not for spiritual reward\u2014but for the improvement of life on earth. The Rar\u00e1muri share with other Uto-Aztecan tribes a veneration of peyote. === Music === Tarahumara style flute, collected by Richard W. Payne, from the collection of Clint GossMusic and dance are highly integrated into Tarahumara social life. The classical pianist Romayne Wheeler writes that \"Music sanctifies the moment in the life of all the Tarahumaras,\" and \"All of our actions have musical meaning.\" During the end of the year cycle, the Tarahumaras play violins which are masterfully carved but not varnished. The tunes are known as matach\u00edn pieces and are danced by dancers lavishly dressed in colorful attire resembling North African garments and accompanied by rattles (s\u00e1uraka). During Lent they play three-holed flutes of river cane, together with drums. === Food === Staple crops of the Tarahumara are maize, beans, greens, squash, and tobacco. Chilli, potatoes, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes appear in Mexicanized regions. Corn is planted in February and March using oxen which are often loaned as not everyone owns one. Corn begins to flower in August; by November it is harvested and cooked or stored. Common corn dishes are pinole, tortillas, esquiate, atole, tamales, and boiled and roasted ears.Fontana, p. 51 Beans are one of the Tarahumaras\u2019 essential protein-rich foods and are usually served fried after being boiled. Tamales and beans are a common food which the Tarahumara carry with them on travels. Wheat and fruits were introduced by missionaries and are a minor source of nutrition. The fruits grown by the Tarahumara include apples, apricots, figs, and oranges. The Tarahumaras also eat meat, but this constitutes less than 5% of their diet. Most of the meats that they consume are fish, chicken, and squirrels.Fontana, p. 60 On ceremonial occasions, domesticated animals such as cows, sheep, and goats are killed and eaten. The Tarahumara practice persistence hunting of deer and wild turkeys by following them at a steady pace for one or two days until the animal drops from exhaustion. According to William Connors, a dietary researcher, their traditional diet was found to be linked to their low incidence of diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes. However, the Tarahumaras' health is transitioning in regions where processed goods have begun to replace their traditional staples. === Clothing === Traditional Tarahumara female dress displayed at the Museo de Arte Popular.

Gatherings for celebrations, races, and religious ceremonies often take place with tesg\u00fcinadas, a Tarahumara-style beer festival. These gatherings take place all year around, but most happen in winter, and are the social events between the neighboring Tarahumara people. Tesg\u00fcinada events include rain fiestas, harvest ceremonies, curing fiestas, Guadalupe Fiesta, Holy Week, races, and Sunday gatherings. Some of these events take place during and after communal activates, for example when neighbors help one another\u2019s families with their fields or building large structures like granaries, houses, and corrals. The harvest and rain ceremonies take place during the farming months to ensure a good crop season. These events also require either a shaman, curandero, or chanter. The job of the shaman and curandero are purely religious, as the curandero is there to diagnose and to heal the sick of the community, and chanters lead the tesg\u00fcinadas in chants and rhythms to accompany the ceremonies.Fontana, p. 57 Tesg\u00fcinadas are an important aspect of Tarahumara culture as it is often the only time when men have intercourse with their wives. They act as a social lubricant, as Tarahumara are very shy and private. Anthropologist John Kennedy describes the institution of tesg\u00fcinada as an important social fabric to Tarahumara culture which he calls the \"tesg\u00fcino network\". He also states that \"the average Tarahumara spends at least 100 days per year directly concerned with tesg\u00fcino and much of this time under its influence or aftereffects.\" The religious role of tesg\u00fcino is a very important aspect to tesg\u00fcinada. Before one can drink an olla of tesg\u00fcino they must dedicate it to Onor\u00faame. During the curing ceremonies, the olla must rest in front of a cross until the ceremony is over. At age 14, a boy is allowed to drink tesg\u00fcino for the first time after a short sermon about his manly responsibilities. These rituals can sometimes last as long as 48 hours. Tesg\u00fcinadas are usually accompanied by dancing and the playing of fiddles, flutes, drums and guitars. Tesg\u00fcino is a fermented drink made year round from sprouted corn. Sometimes it is also made with still-green stalks, fruits of certain cactuses, shrubs, wheat, and trees when corn is sparse. The process begins by malting the corn and spreading it in a shallow basket covered with pine needles each day for four or five days. It is kept moist until the corn sprouts by which time the starch in the corn has fermented. It is then mashed and boiled for eight hours. Varied herbs are ground up and mixed with water into a paste which is then fermented overnight by a fire. Then the paste is combined with the corn liquid and fermented for another three to four days. Tesg\u00fcinadas usually take place soon after as the tesg\u00fcino can spoil within 24 hours.Fontana, p. 54 == Notable Rar\u00e1muri == *Daniel Ponce de Le\u00f3n, former WBO world junior featherweight champion *Arnulfo Quimare, ultra marathoner *Xemexe Tlalistak, contemporary jeweler, artist *Isidro Baldenegro L\u00f3pez, community leader and activist *Edwin Bustillos, award-winning agricultural engineer *Jacob Casillas, award-winning mechanical engineer *Dr. Octavio Casillas, award-winning educator *Mar\u00eda Lorena Ram\u00edrez, ultra marathoner *Carmelita Little Turtle, photographer == Threats == === Environmental factors === Tarahumara man collecting firewood. Logging has occurred since the end of the 1800s when the first loggers arrived. Later, liberalization of laws in the 1990s resulted in the exhaustion of resources.The forest industry in the Sierra Madre of Chihuahua: Social, Economic and Ecological impacts . De los Derechos Humanos, A.C. Chihuahua Mexico and Texas Center for Policy Studies (2000) pp. 5\u20136. In 1995, it was declared that \"after hundred years of logging, only two percent (300,000 acres) of these unique forests remains\", leaving one of the most biologically diverse ecosystem in North America, containing hundreds of medicinal plant, oak and pine species in danger of extinction. The Mexican Commission of Solidarity and Defense of Human Rights produced a report in 2000 noting the lack of studies by the government on how lumber production affected the ecosystem. Similarly, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) boosted foreign investment which resulted in the privatization of communal land, and market-based mechanisms of environmental regulation. In January 2017, Isidro Baldenegro L\u00f3pez (2005 recipient of the Goldman Environmental Prize) a community leader of the Tarahumara, was shot and killed in Mexico. Baldenegro spent much of his life defending the ancient forests of the Sierra Madre region from the devastating effects of logging. Drought has also been affecting the region for ten years and has worsened in recent years. During 2011, it was the driest year in Mexico on record, with just 12 inches of rain, compared to a historic average of 21 inches.North Mexico wilts under worst drought on record. AP via Oaoa.com (2011-12-02). Retrieved on 2014-08-22. The most severely hit area was the Sierra Madre region. Agricultural losses in Chihuahua are estimated at $25 million; 180,000 cattle have already died, as a result of the growing lack of precipitation in the region. Due to the lack of water, crops were destroyed and famine spread. Combined with freezing temperatures of a cold front, living conditions have become poor for the Rar\u00e1muri. Their dependence on the environment worsens the situation, as they lack employment opportunities to generate income in non- farming activities.Drought and famine: an insight to the Tarahumara . Tecglobalist. March 3, 2012. Moreover, increased contact with the outside world might be damaging as it creates dependency. These indigenous people face extreme poverty, as reflected in the Mexican Human Development Index (HDI) which in the Sierra Madre is the lowest in the country: 49.1% below national average.Crisis en la Tarahumara: \u00bfQu\u00e9, c\u00f3mo y por qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo la crisis alimentaria en la Tarahumara? .

Reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign ownership, and resulted in reopening of mines and increased mining. According to the Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda, 204 mining companies with direct foreign investment had 310 ongoing projects in Mexico in 2006.

The environmental impacts are dramatic, resulting in landscape change and the spread of heavy metals. === Effect of drug violence === Drug violence, cultivation and trade in this region has affected the lifestyle of the Rar\u00e1muri, given the proximity of the people and the Sierra Madre, one of the most productive drug growing regions on Earth. Logging is not only controlled by the Mexican government, but also practiced illegally by loggers and drug lords who use the forests to grow marijuana or opium or as space for their operations. Drug cartels usually have links with logging companies who launder money earned in the drug trade.Beadle, Kristian. (2010-07-15) The Drug Destruction of Mexico, Part II . Psmag.com.

Cartels have exploited the Tarahumaras' reputation as long distance runners by forcing them into running illegal drugs into the United States. === Tourism === Two Rar\u00e1muri women (one with a baby nursing) at Arareco Lake near Creel, Chihuahua. The Tarahumara women wear the traditional brightly colored clothes for which they are famous. These women make and sell hand-made items at the lake. The remote terrain of the Sierra Madre has long served as a refuge of the Tarahumara. However, roads and tourism have expanded, bringing opportunities for some but problems for others. Ironically, the Rar\u00e1muri themselves seldom have sought this publicity. In the 1800s, attempts were made to build a railway. Currently, this line is used by the train Chihuahua Pac\u00edfico or El Chepe to transport tourists, lured by false representations of the area as pure and pristine, to sightseeing locales. It stops near many Tarahumara villages, attracting visitors expecting to see primitive natives (the legend of the Tarahumara). Along with new auto roads, railways built into the area have developed lumbering and tourism, which have accelerated the rate of modernization among the Indians. ==See also== * Multiday races * Raramuri Criollo cattle * Ivan Ratkaj * Tarahumara language == References == ==Bibliography== * * ==Further reading== *Carl Sofus Lumholtz: Unknown Mexico: A Record of Five Years' Exploration Among the Tribes of the Western Sierra Madre; In the Tierra Caliente of Tepic and Jalisco; and Among the Tarascos of Michoacan, (New York: Scribner's and Sons, 1902) *:An early anthropological account from the 1890s of the peoples in the remote mountains of northwest Mexico, including the Tarahumara. *Wendell C.
