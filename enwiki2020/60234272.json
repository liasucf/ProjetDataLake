    "text": "Self-Portrait. Between the Clock and the Bed is a 1940-1943 self-portrait painting by Edvard Munch, and is one of his last major works. He depicts himself as an unhappy, aging older man. Behind him is a bright room full of light and past paintings, but he has placed his current self between a clock and a bed, symbolizing the inevitable passing of time and where he will eventually lay down for the final time. == References == Category:Paintings by Edvard Munch Category:Paintings of the Munch Museum Category:1940s paintings ",
