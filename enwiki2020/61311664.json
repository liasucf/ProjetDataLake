Legal proceedings against her were eventually dropped after a successful appeal.

Following the events of September 30, 2010, she was accused of terrorism and sabotage after a cell phone video allegedly showing her inciting a group of students to violence in Guayaquil was presented on Citizen Link.

In August 2011, while still facing the criminal proceedings against her in Guayaquil, she was elected provincial director of the MPD in Manab\u00ed. That October she became its first deputy director. In the 2014 elections she ran for the mayoralty of Portoviejo, obtaining fourth place on the CREO Movement candidacy. On September 27, 2014, Zamora was appointed first deputy director of Popular Unity, which emerged after the dissolution of the MPD.
