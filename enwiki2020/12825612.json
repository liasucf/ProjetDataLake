    "text": "Karges Furniture is a family-owned furniture company originating in Evansville, Indiana. The company manufactures custom high-end furniture which is sold mostly to designers through wholesale showrooms. After the acquisition of Karges by another luxury furniture maker, Kindel Furniture, all production of Karges was moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. All of the company's casegoods are now made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ==History== In 1886, Albert F. Karges, a first-generation immigrant, invested $600 and began making moderately priced bedroom furniture of solid oak and walnut. At that time, the river port town of Evansville, Indiana was one of the largest hardwood furniture manufacturing centers in the world. Frederick Bockstege was the company president until 1910. The company prospered through the turn of the century and Albert's son, Edwin F. Karges, Sr., joined the family business after World War I. He had an interest in European designs and traveled extensively in an effort to learn more about the old-world styles. Soon, the Karges line took on a more classic look and began separating itself from its competitors as he began to develop his own ideas. After World War II, Edwin's son, Edwin F. Karges, Jr., joined the business. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Wood Technology, and his knowledge and skill in wood finishing provided the groundwork for developing the Karges finishing process. Over the years all four of the Karges children have been involved in the business. Joan Karges Rogier worked alongside her father and represented the fourth generation of leadership. Karges was acquired by Kindel Furniture on April 30, 2014. At the time, Kindel stated it planned to invest in the Karges brand and continue the tradition of craftsmanship carried forth by five generations of Karges family ownership. Gretchen Keith, the great-great-granddaughter of company founder Albert Karges, joined Kindel as vice president of marketing and sales.http://mibiz.com/item/21526-kindel-acquires-indiana-based-luxury- furniture-company ==External links== *Karges official site ==References== Category:Furniture companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Indiana Category:Companies based in Evansville, Indiana ",
