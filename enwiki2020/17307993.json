    "text": "{| |} The Kvalsund ship (Norwegian: Kvalsundskipet) is a late 7th century rowing ship, discovered embedded in a marsh on Kvalsund in Her\u00f8y, M\u00f8re og Romsdal near \u00c5lesund in 1920, along with a smaller rowboat called Kvalsundferingen. It is of an earlier construction than the Oseberg and Gokstad ship, both of which date to the ninth century. The Kvalsund ship dates to 690AD. The ship featured a detachable rudder on one side that could be removed in shallow water, and its shape strongly suggests it had a sail - if so, it would be the first Scandinavian ship discovered to have one. ==References== * New Viking Ship, The New York Times, August 22, 1920, pg.
