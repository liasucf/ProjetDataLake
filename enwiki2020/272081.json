Anas\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online. Born in the city of Medina, Malik rose to become the premier scholar of prophetic traditions in his day, which he sought to apply to \"the whole legal life\" in order to create a systematic method of Muslim jurisprudence which would only further expand with the passage of time. Referred to as the \"Imam of Medina\" by his contemporaries, Malik's views in matters of jurisprudence were highly cherished both in his own life and afterwards, and he became the founder of one of the four schools of Sunni law, the Maliki, which became the normative rite for the Sunni practice of much of North Africa, Andalusia, a vast portion of Egypt, and some parts of Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Khorasan, and the prominent Sufi orders, including the Shadiliyya and the Tijaniyyah.See \"Shadiliyya\" and \"Tijaniyyah\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online. Perhaps Malik's most famous accomplishment in the annals of Islamic history is, however, his compilation of the Muwatta, one of the oldest and most revered Sunni hadith collections and one of \"the earliest surviving Muslim law-book[s],\" in which Malik attempted to \"give a survey of law and justice; ritual and practice of religion according to the consensus of Islam in Medina, according to the sunna usual in Medina; and to create a theoretical standard for matters which were not settled from the point of view of consensus and sunna.\" Composed in the early days of the Abbasid caliphate, during which time there was a burgeoning \"recognition and appreciation of the canon law\" of the ruling party, Malik's work aimed to trace out a \"smoothed path\" (which is what al-muwa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02be literally means) through \"the farreaching differences of opinion even on the most elementary questions.\" Hailed as \"the soundest book on earth after the Quran\" by al-Shafi'i, the compilation of the Muwatta led to Malik being bestowed with such reverential epithets as \"Shaykh of Islam\", \"Proof of the Community\", \"Imam of the Abode of Emigration\", and \"Knowledgeable Scholar of Medina\" in later Sunni tradition. According to classical Sunni tradition, the Islamic Nabi (Prophet) Muhammad foretold the birth of Malik, saying: \"Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge and they shall find no one more expert than the knowledgeable scholar of Medina,\"\"Narrated by Abu Hurayrah by Ahmad, al-Tirmidhi who said it is hasan -- in some manuscripts hasan sahih -- al-Hakim (1:90-91) with three chains, declaring it sahih by Muslim's criterion, al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra (1:386), etc.\" (Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools [London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007], p. 121, note 271). and, in another tradition, \"The people ... shall set forth from East and West without finding a sage other than the sage of the people in Medina.\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 122 While some later scholars, such as Ibn Hazm and Tahawi, did cast doubt on identifying the mysterious wise man of both these traditions with Malik,Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 122-23 the most widespread interpretation nevertheless continued to be that which held the personage to be Malik. Throughout Islamic history, Malik has been venerated as an exemplary figure in all the traditional schools of Sunni thought, both by the exoteric ulema and by the mystics, with the latter often designating him as a saint in their hagiographies.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 179-81John Renard (tr.), Knowledge of God in Classical Sufism (New York: Paulist Press, 2004), p. 131, et passim. Malik's most notable student, al-Shafi'i (who would himself become the founder of another of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law) later said of his teacher: \"No one constitutes as great a favor to me in the Religion of God as Malik ... when the scholars of knowledge are mentioned, Malik is the guiding star.\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 158 ==Biography== Malik was born as the son of Anas ibn Malik (not the Sahabi with the same name) and Aaliyah bint Shurayk al- Azdiyya in Medina, circa 711. His family was originally from the al-Asbahi tribe of Yemen, but his great grandfather Abu 'Amir relocated the family to Medina after converting to Islam in the second year of the Hijri calendar, or 623 CE. His grandfather Malik ibn Abi Amir was a student of the second Caliph of Islam Umar and was one of those involved in the collection of the parchments upon which Quranic texts were originally written when those were collected during the Caliph Uthman era.M M Azami, The History of the Quranic Text, page 100-101 According to Al-Muwatta, he was tall, heavyset, imposing of stature, very fair, with white hair and beard but bald, with a huge beard and blue eyes. ===Teachers=== Living in Medina gave Malik access to some of the most learned minds of early Islam. He memorized the Quran in his youth, learning recitation from Abu Suhail Nafi' ibn 'Abd ar-Rahman, from whom he also received his Ijazah, or certification and permission to teach others. He studied under various famed scholars including Hisham ibn Urwah and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri. Also, as with Abu Hanifah (founder of the Hanafi Sunni Madh'hab), Imam Malik (who was a teacher of Imam Ash-Shafi\u2018i, who in turn was a teacher of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) was a student of the Shi'ite Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, who was a descendant of Muhammad. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni Fiqh are connected to Ja'far from the Bayt (Household) of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly. ===Golden Chain of Narration=== Malik's chain of narrators was considered the most authentic and called Silsilat al-Dhahab or \"The Golden Chain of Narrators\" by notable hadith scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari. The 'Golden Chain' of narration (i.e., that considered by the scholars of Hadith to be the most authentic) consists of Malik, who narrated from Nafi\u2018 Mawla ibn \u2018Umar, who narrated from Ibn Umar, who narrated from Muhammad. ===Mention in Hadith=== The Prophet Muhammad reportedly said in a hadith authenticated by Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi: \"Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge, and they shall find no-one more knowledgeable than the knowledgeable scholar of Madina.\" Qadi Ayyad, Al- Dhahabi and others relate from Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah, \u2018Abd ar-Razzaq as-San\u2018ani, Ibn Mahdi, Yahya ibn Ma'in, Dhu\u2019ayb ibn `Imama, Ibn al-Madini, and others that they considered that scholar to be Malik ibn Anas.http://eshaykh.com/hadith/hadith-abour-imam-malik-r/ ==Views== ===Theology=== Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr wrote that Malik was 'the furthest of all people' from dialectic theology who was the most knowledgeable of their discussions without accepting their views.Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, Imam Dar al-Hijrah, pg. 285, 2nd ed. Damascus: Dar al-Qalam, 1998. G.F. Haddad, on the other hand, argued that Malik was not completely averse to the idea of dialectic theology; on the contrary, Haddad points to Malik having studied 'at the feet of Ibn Hurmuz', a master in dialectic theology, for 'thirteen to sixteen years'.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 170 ====Anthropomorphism==== Malik's unique contributions to the field of theology specifically is that he was a strict opponent of anthropomorphism, and deemed it absurd to compare the attributes of God, which were given in \"human imagery\" such as that of God's \"hands\" or \"eyes\" with those of man. For example, when a man asked Malik about the meaning of Quran 20:5, \"The Merciful established Himself over the Throne,\" it is related that \"nothing affected Malik so much as that man's question,\" and the jurist fervently responded: \"The 'how' of it is inconceivable; the 'establishment' part of it is unknown; belief in it is obligatory; asking about it is an innovation.\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 167; narrated by Al-Dhahab\u012b, Siyar, 7:415, cf. al-Bayhaq\u012b, al-Asm\u0101' wal-Sif\u0101t, 2:304-305:866.Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, pg. 292-293. ====Beatific vision==== Malik was a supporter of the orthodox Sunni doctrine of the beatific vision,Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al- Imam Malik, pp. 293-294. and he is said to have cited Quran 75:22-23 (\"That day will faces be resplendent, looking toward their Lord,\") and 83:15 (\"Nay! Verily, from their Lord, that day, shall they [the transgressors] be veiled,\") as proof of his belief.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 181Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, pp. 294. ====Faith's nature==== When he was asked about the nature of faith, Malik defined it as \"speech and works\" (qawlun wa-'amal), which shows that Malik was averse to the rigorous separation of between faith and works.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 176 ====Intercession==== Malik seems to have been a proponent of intercession in personal supplication. For example, it is related that when the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur asked Malik about whether it was preferable to face the Prophet's tomb or the qibla whilst doing the personal prayer or dua, Malik responded: \"Why should you not face him when he is your means (was\u012bla) to God and that of your father Adam on the Day of Resurrection?\"al-Q\u0101d\u012b 'Iy\u0101d, al-Shif\u0101, pp. 520-521 and Tart\u012bb al-Mad\u0101rik 2:101, narrated \"with a good, or rather sound chain\" (al-Zarq\u0101n\u012b, comment. on al-Maw\u0101hib al-L\u0101duniyya); cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 181 Regarding this tradition, the thirteenth-century hadith master Ibn Jam\u0101\u02bfa said: \"The report is related by the two hadith masters Ibn Bashkuw\u0101l and al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b \u02bfIy\u0101\u1e0d in al- Shif\u0101, and no attention is paid to the words of those who claim that it is forged purely on the basis of their idle desires.\"Hid\u0101yat al-S\u0101lik, 3:1381; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 While both Ibn Taymiyyah and, much more recently, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's grandson Sulaym\u0101n did indeed reject the authenticity of this tradition,See Ibn Taymiyyah, Fat\u0101w\u0101, 27:166 and 28:26; Sulaym\u0101n ibn Abd All\u0101h ibn Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahh\u0101b, Tays\u012br al-'Az\u012bz al- Ham\u012bd f\u012b Sharh Kit\u0101b al-Tawh\u012bd, p. 312 their opinions were characterized by the vast majority of mainstream Sunni scholars such as al-Zarq\u0101n\u012b as \"stemming either from ignorance or arrogance.\"Cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182, note 437 Historically, it is known that Malik's statements on the validity of intercession remained a core doctrine of the Maliki school, and practically all Maliki thinkers of the classical era accepted the idea of the Prophet's intercession.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 It is also known, moreover, that the classical \"books of the M\u0101lik\u012bs are replete with the stipulation that du'\u0101 [personal supplication] be made while facing the grave.\"Al-Zarq\u0101n\u012b; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 ====Mysticism==== On the basis of several early traditions, it is evident that Malik held the early Sufis and their practices in high regard.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 179 It is related, moreover, that Malik was a strong proponent of combining the \"inward science\" ('ilm al-b\u0101tin) of mystical knowledge with the \"outward science\" of jurisprudence. For example, the famous twelfth-century Maliki jurist and judge Qadi Iyad, later venerated as a saint throughout the Iberian Peninsula, narrated a tradition in which a man asked Malik \"about something in the inward science,\" to which Malik replied: \"Truly none knows the inward science except those who know the outward science! When he knows the outward science and puts it into practice, God shall open for him the inward science - and that will not take place except by the opening of his heart and its enlightenment.\"al-Q\u0101d\u012b 'Iy\u0101d, Tart\u012bb al-Mad\u0101rik, 2:41, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 179 In other similar traditions, it is related that Malik said: \"He who practices Sufism (tasawwuf) without learning Sacred Law corrupts his faith (tazandaqa), while he who learns Sacred Law without practicing Sufism corrupts himself (tafassaqa). Only he who combines the two proves true (tahaqqaqa).\"Al-Q\u0101r\u012b (d. 1014 AH), Sharh 'Ayn al-'Ilm (1989 ed., 1:33); Ahmad Zarr\u016bq (d. 899), in the fourth of his Qaw\u0101'id al-Tasawwuf (Cairo, 1310); 'Al\u012b al-'Adaw\u012b (d. 1190) in comment. on Ibn Ab\u012b Zayd's Ris\u0101la (Beirut?: D\u0101r Ihy\u0101' al-Kutub al-'Arabiyya, n.d. 2:195); Ibn 'Aj\u012bba (d. 1224) in Iqaz al-Himam f\u012b Sharh al-Hikam (Cairo: Halab\u012b, 1392/1972), pp. 5-6; all cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 180, note 429. While there are a few traditions relating that Malik, while not an opponent of mysticism as a whole, was nonetheless adverse specifically to the practice of group dhikr, such traditions have been graded as being munkar or \"weak\" in their chain of transmission.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 180 Furthermore, it has been argued that none of these reports - all of which relate Malik's disapproving amusement at being told about an instance of group dhikr happening nearby - explicitly display any disapproval of the act as such, but rather serve as a criticism of \"some people who passed for Sufis in his time [who] apparently committed certain excesses or breaches of the sacred law.\" As both their chains of transmission are weak and not consistent with what is related of Malik elsewhere, the traditions are rejected by many scholars, although latter-day critics of Sufism do occasionally cite them in support of their position. ===Relics=== Malik was a supporter of tabarruk or the \"seeking of blessing through [the veneration of] relics.\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 177 This is evident, for example, in the fact that Malik approvingly related the tradition of a certain At\u0101' ibn Ab\u012b Rab\u0101h, whom he saw \"enter the [Prophet's] Mosque, then take hold of the pommel of the Pulpit, after which he faced the qibla [to pray],\" thereby supporting the holding of the pommel for its blessings (baraka) by virtue of its having touched the Prophet Muhammad. Furthermore, it is also recorded that \"when one of the caliphs manifested his intention to replace the wooden pulpit of the Prophet with a pulpit of silver and jewels,\" Malik exclaimed: \"I do not consider it good that people be deprived of the relics of the Messenger of God!\" (L\u0101 ar\u0101 yu\u1e25rama al-n\u0101su \u0101th\u0101ra ras\u016blill\u0101h). ===Sunnah of the Prophet=== Malik considered following the sunnah of the Prophet to be of capital importance for every Muslim. It is reported that he said: \"The sunnah is Noah's Ark. Whoever boards it is saved, and whoever remains away from it perishes.\"Narrated from Ibn Wahb by al-Khat\u012bb in T\u0101r\u012bkh Baghd\u0101d, 7:336 and al-Suy\u016bt\u012b, Mift\u0101h al-Janna, p. 162: 391, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 175 ===Ethics=== ====Differences of opinion==== Accounts of Malik's life demonstrate that the scholar cherished differences of opinion amongst the ulema as a mercy from God to the Islamic community.From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 162-164 Even \"in Malik's time there were those who forwarded the idea of a unified madhhab and the ostensive removal of all differences between the Sunni schools of law,\" with \"three successive caliphs\" having sought to \"impose the Muwatta and Malik's school upon the entire Islamic world of their time,\" but \"Malik refused to allow it every time ... [for he held that the differences in opinion among the jurists]\" were a \"mercy\" for the people.From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 162-163 When the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur said to Malik: \"I want to unify this knowledge. I shall write to the leaders of the armies and to the rulers so that they make it law, and whoever contravenes it shall be put to death,\" Malik is said to have responded: \"Commander of the Believers, there is another way. Truly, the Prophet was present in this community, he used to send out troops or set forth in person, and he did not conquer many lands until God took back his soul. Then Abu Bakr arose and he also did not conquer many lands. Then Umar arose after the two of them and many lands were conquered at his hands. As a result, he faced the necessity of sending out the Companions of Muhammad as teachers and people did not cease to take from them, notable scholars from notable scholars until our time. If you now go and change them from what they know to what they do not know they shall deem it disbelief (kufr). Rather, confirm the people of each land with regard to whatever knowledge is there, and take this knowledge to yourself.\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 163 According to another narration, al-Mansur, after hearing Malik's answers to certain important questions, said: \"I have resolved to give the order that your writings be copied and disseminated to every Muslim region on earth, so that they be put in practice exclusively of any other rulings. They will leave aside innovations and keep only this knowledge. For I consider that the source of knowledge is the narrative tradition of Medina and the knowledge of its scholars.\"Narrated from al-W\u0101qid\u012b by Ibn Sa'd in the supplemental volume of his Tabaq\u0101t (p. 440) and from al-Zubayr ibn Bakk\u0101r by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in his al-Intiq\u0101 (p. 81). Cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 163 To this, Malik is said to have replied: \"Commander of the Believers, do not! For people have already heard different positions, heard hadith, and related narrations. Every group has taken whatever came to them and put it into practice, conforming to it while other people differed. To take them away from what they have been professing will cause a disaster. Therefore, leave people with whatever school they follow and whatever the people of each country chose for themselves.\" ====Knowing the limits of knowledge==== Malik is famous for declaring: \"The shield of the 'alim is: 'I do not know.' If he neglects it, he will receive a mortal blow.\"Ibn 'Abd al-Barr, al-Intiq\u0101, pp. 74-75; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 176 Elsewhere, a certain Kh\u0101lid ibn Khid\u0101sh related: \"I travelled all the way from Iraq to see M\u0101lik about forty questions. He did not answer me except on five. Then he said: \u02bfIbn \u02bfIjl\u0101n used to say: If the 'alim bypasses 'I do not know,' he will receive a mortal blow.\" Likewise, al-Haytham ibn Jam\u012bl said: \"I saw M\u0101lik ibn Anas being asked forty-eight questions, and he replied to thirty-two of them: 'I do not know.'\" Later on, Malik's disciple, Ibn Wahb, related: \"I heard \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Yaz\u012bd ibn Hurmuz say: 'The 'ulema must instill in those who sit with him the phrase 'I do not know' until it becomes a foundational principle (asl) before them and they seek refuge in it from danger.\" ====Religious disputation==== Malik is said to have detested disputing in matters of religion, saying: \"Disputation (al-jid\u0101l) in the religion fosters self-display, does away with the light of the heart and hardens it, and produces aimless wandering.\"From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 170 Needless argument, therefore, was disapproved of by Malik, and he also chose to keep silent about religious matters in general unless he felt obliged to speak in fear of \"the spread of misguidance or some similar danger.\"From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 171 ===Social=== ====Shaving the moustache==== In the Muwatta, Malik writes: \"Shaving the mustache is an innovation.\" Elsewhere, it is written that he \"detested and condemned\" shaving of the mustache and, furthermore, \"disliked inordinate length for the beard.\" While several other scholars held both the clipping (qass) and the removal (ihf\u0101') of the mustache to be sunnah, Malik only considered the former to be truly prophetically prescribed, deeming the latter an unpalatable innovation. ==Physical appearance== The available physical descriptions of Malik relate that he \"was tall, heavy-set, imposing of stature, very fair, with white beard ... [and] bald ... [with] blue eyes.\" Furthermore, it is also related that \"he always wore beautiful clothes, especially [those that were] white.\" ==Death== Tomb of Malik Malik died at the age of 83 or 84 in Medina in 795 CE, and is buried in the cemetery of Al-Baqi', across from the Mosque of the Prophet. Although there was a small shrine constructed around his grave during the late medieval period, with many Muslims visiting it to pay their respects, the construction was razed to the ground by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during their campaign of demolishing many of the traditional Islamic heritage sites after the kingdom's establishment in 1932.The medieval Andalusian Muslim traveler and geographer Ibn Jubayr describes seeing a small dome erected above the tomb of Malik when he visited the cemetery in the later twelfth-century. Malik's last words were related by one Isma'il ibn Abi Uways who said, \"Malik became sick, so I asked some of our people about what he said at the time of his death. They said, \"He recited the testification of faith and then he recited: > Their affair is for God, before and after.Quran 30:4 ==Works== Imam Malik wrote: *Al-Muwatta, \"The Approved,\" which was said to have been regarded by Shafi'i to be the soundest book on Earth after the Qur'an. *Al-Mudawwana al-Kubra, written down by Sahnun ibn Sa'id ibn Habib at- Tanukhi (c. 776-7 \u2013 854-5) after the death of Malik ibn Anas. ==See also== *Salaf **Tabi' al-Tabi'in *The Seven Fuqaha of Medina ==References== ==External links== * Biodata at MuslimScholars.info * Life of Imam Malik * Biography of Imam Malik at Lost Islamic History * Biography of Imam Malik * A comprehensive Biography of Imam Malik * Al-Muwatta' of Imam Malik * Muslims of Norwich, a Maliki community * : BIOGRAPHY OF IMAM MALIK * The lifestyle of Im\u00e2m M\u00e2lik Ibn Anas (at-tawhid.net) * Malik, Imam B Anas \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0643 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0633 ; A complete biography on Imam Malik bin Anas Category:711 births Category:795 deaths Category:8th-century Arabs Category:8th-century jurists Category:8th- century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:8th-century writers Category:Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:Arab scholars Category:Hadith compilers Category:Maliki fiqh scholars Category:Mujaddid Category:Muslim theologians Category:Sunni imams Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Taba\u2018 at-Tabi\u2018in ",
