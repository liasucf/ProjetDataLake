    "text": "The National Popular Rally (, RNP, 1941\u20131944) was a French political party and one of the main collaborationist parties under the Vichy regime of World War II. Created in February 1941 by former members of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) of the neosocialist tendency and led by Marcel D\u00e9at, the party was heavily influenced by fascism and saw the circumstances of the occupation as an opportunity to revolutionarise France. ==February\u2013October 1941: the RNP-MNR period== Marcel D\u00e9at, a neosocialist expelled from the SFIO in November 1933 and former Minister, first proposed to create a single state party during the 1940 summer, immediately following the proclamation of the Vichy regime. Briefly arrested by the French police on 13 December 1940, he finally created the RNP in February 1941, which became one of the primary collaborationist parties, along with Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF), Marcel Bucard's Francisme and Pierre Cl\u00e9menti's French National- Collectivist Party. Immediately, the German authorities imposed a fusion between Marcel D\u00e9at's RNP and the far-right Social Revolutionary Movement (MSR) of Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle, an inheritor of the Cagoule terrorist group The first committee of direction of the RNP-MSR was composed of two RNP members and three MSR members: Marcel D\u00e9at, Jean Fontenoy, Jean Van Ormelingen (alias Jean Vanor), Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle and Jean Goy. However, the fusion between the RNP and the MSR was a failure, in part because D\u00e9at's RNP recruited mainly among former members of the French Left while the MSR was from the beginning located on the far-right of the political spectrum. The MSR conserved de facto its autonomy inside the RNP and was mainly charged of forming the RNP's security service. After the assassination attempt of Paul Collette against Pierre Laval, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain's Prime Minister and Marcel D\u00e9at on 27 August 1941, the latter accused the MSR of having attempted to eliminate him. Thereafter, the MSR was excluded from the RNP in October 1941, leading to the reorganization of the RNP (and exclusion of elements close to the MSR) until the first months of 1942. ==The RNP without the MSR (after October 1941)== The ideology of the RNP was clearly of a fascist nature, advocating antisemitic and racist policies and sharing a strong admiration for Nazi Germany. Despite this, it differed from Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF) in that it maintained the principle of universal suffrage, public education, anti- clericalism or the conservation of sculptures of Marianne, a republican symbol, in the townhalls.Pascal Ory. Les collaborateurs. Those ideas created constant conflicts between the RNP and more reactionary elements of Vichy who also supported the R\u00e9volution nationale (\"National Revolution\") and had been trained in the Action fran\u00e7aise monarchist movement. On a tactic level, the RNP supported Pierre Laval and criticized the \"Vichy reactionaries\" and the PPF. Marcel D\u00e9at maintained close links with the German ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz, whilst Doriot turned himself towards the SS. After Laval's return to government in April 1942 and the Nazi occupation of the Southern Zone in November 1942, D\u00e9at focused all his efforts on creating a single party of the Collaboration which would permit him to impose himself as its sole leader. In November 1942, the leaders of the RNP, D\u00e9at and Georges Albertini, met with MSR leaders such as Georges Soul\u00e8s. Following this meeting, the RNP created the National Revolutionary Front (Front r\u00e9volutionnaire national, FRN) which gathered the main collaborationist parties, apart from Doriot's PPF. The FRN thus included the RNP-Labour Social Front, the MSR, the Parti franciste, the Groupe Collaboration, the Jeunes de l'Europe nouvelle and the Comit\u00e9 d\u2019action antibolch\u00e9vique (Anti-Bolshevik Action Committee). D\u00e9at furthermore managed to gain to his side the secretary of the PPF, Jean Fossati, and named to the head of the FRN Henri Barb\u00e9, issued from the PPF. However, the FRN finally was a failure. In March 1944, D\u00e9at was named Minister of Labour and of National Solidarity and took as assistants the RNP leaders (Georges Albertini, Georges Dumoulin, Ludovic Zoretti and Gabriel Lafaye) From then on, he focused more on his ministry tasks than on the organization of the RNP. On 17 August 1944, D\u00e9at took refuge in Nazi Germany almost alone. In charge of the youth organisation of the RNP, Roland Gaucher would also accompany P\u00e9tain into exile in the Sigmaringen enclave. ==Organisation of the RNP following October 1941== The RNP had at maximum 30,000 members.Le Marec-Lambert. According to the historian Robert Soucy, it had only 2,638 party members, of whom only 12.8 percent were industrial workers.David Carroll, Jaap Querido and Robert J. Soucy. \"'France's Hollow Years': An Exchange\". New York Review of Books. Volume 43. Number 13. 8 August 1996 . Its mouthpiece, directed by Roland Gaucher, was Le National Populaire, but the party was also supported by D\u00e9at's daily, L'\u0152uvre. The youth organisation (Jeunesses nationales populaires, JNP) was headed by Roland Silly, Roland Gaucher (future co-founder of the National Front in 1972) and eight other personalities. ==Primary members of the RNP (after October 1941)== RNP members: Jean Fontenoy, Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle, Marcel D\u00e9at, Jean Goy and Jean Van Ormelingen. The RNP was directed by a permanent commission of 15 members.
