It currently operates as a helicopter training squadron and is based at HMAS Albatross at Nowra, New South Wales. ==History== 723 Squadron was first commissioned into the RAN on 7 April 1952 and was equipped with one Dakota, one Wirraway, one Sea Otter and two Sea Fury aircraft. On 11 March 1953 the Squadron took delivery of the RAN's first helicopter, a Bristol Sycamore. 723 Squadron also took delivery of the RAN's first jet aircraft, a de Havilland Vampire Mk T.34 on 18 June 1954. During the Vietnam War, personnel from the squadron operated as part of the Experimental Military Unit, a joint Australian-American helicopter assault and transport unit. During the squadron's history, the battle honours \"Vietnam 1967\u201371\", \"Kuwait 1991\", and \"East Timor 1999\" have been earned. ==Current roles== 723 is currently active as the Australian Defence Force's helicopter training squadron operating the EC-135T2+ helicopter at the Joint Helicopter School. It was previously equipped with 13 Aerospatiale AS 350BA Ecureuil (Squirrel) and three Bell 429 helicopters. The Squadron is based at HMAS Albatross (NAS Nowra). The Squirrels were used for conversion training all pilots, observers and aircrew from fixed wing to rotary wing aircraft. The Bell 429 joined the Squadron in 2012 on lease from Raytheon Australia and are used for multi engine training for pilots moving onto other aircraft such as the S-70B-2 Seahawk. ==Aircraft== A 723 Squadron Squirrel in 2008 A 723 Squadron Hawker Siddeley HS 748 A Bell Kiowa of 723 Squadron in 1998 ===Current=== *Aerospatiale AS 350BA Ecureuil (Squirrel) \u2013 training *Bell 429 - training, search and rescue, medevac and personnel transport. ===Previous=== *Supermarine Sea Otter *de Havilland Tiger Moth *Auster Autocar *CAC Wirraway *Bristol Sycamore *Hawker Sea Fury *Fairey Firefly *Westland Scout *de Havilland Sea Venom *de Havilland Vampire *Douglas C-47 Dakota *Bell UH-1 *Bell/CAC 206B-1 Kiowa *Westland Wessex *Hawker Siddeley HS 748 *Agusta A109EArticle from The Australian newspaper online, retrieved 2007-08-30. ==References== ==External links== * RAN webpage on 723 Squadron's history * Fleet Air Arm Association of Australia webpage on 723 Squadron Category:Australian naval aviation Category:Military units and formations established in 1952 ",
