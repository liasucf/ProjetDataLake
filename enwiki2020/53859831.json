It was smaller and lighter than the S-7 on which it was based, and had a conventional wooden fuselage. The cockpit featured side-by-side seating with controls for the pilot only on the left. Originally built with ailerons controlled by steel tubes inside the wings, it was later redesigned using wing warping for roll control. ==Operational history== Initial flight tests showed good performance from the wing design with a short take-off run of and low stall speed. Further tests revealed limited roll authority leading to the change from ailerons to wing warping. The S-11 won second place in a reconnaissance aircraft competition hosted by the Russian military in 1913, but no orders were ever placed for additional examples. ==Specifications== ==References== S-11 Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Mid-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1913 Category:Rotary-engined aircraft ",
