    "text": "The Germanisches National Museum is a museum in Nuremberg, Germany. Founded in 1852, it houses a large collection of items relating to German culture and art extending from prehistoric times through to the present day. The Germanisches National Museum is Germany's largest museum of cultural history. Out of its total holding of some 1.3 million objects (including the holdings of the library and the Department of Prints and Drawings), approximately 25,000 are exhibited. The museum is situated in the south of the historic city center between Kornmarkt and Frauentormauer along the medieval city wall. Its entrance hall is situated on Kart\u00e4usergasse which was transformed by the Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan to the Way of Human Rights (). == Name, establishment, guiding principles == The inscription \u201eEigenthum der deutschen Nation\u201c (\"Property of the German Nation\") at the main entrance was installed when the museum was founded in 1852, and was commissioned by Hans von und zu Aufse\u00df The Germanisches Museum, as it was named initially, was founded by a group of individuals led by the Franconian baron Hans von und zu Aufsess, whose goal was to assemble a \"well-ordered compendium of all available source material for German history, literature and art\". The term Germanic should be understood in the historical context of the mid nineteenth century. In 1846, German linguists and historians, amongst them the Brothers Grimm, Leopold Ranke und Jacob Burckhardt, had met in Frankfurt, and decided to use \"Germanistik\" as a comprehensive term embracing all the fields of their academic disciplines related to the culture of German speaking regions. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 had failed to achieve a liberalised and unified Germany. Thus the name of the museum maintained the idea of a close cultural relationship within a region defined by the common German language, and a shared German cultural tradition. In 1852, the museum's intention to document the cultural unity of the German-speaking areas was a progressive concept, free from any exaggerated Chauvinism. Only in 1871, when the German Empire was constituted, the museum paid tribute to it by adding national to its name. The museum understands itself as an important research and educational institution. As a national museum and a museum of the entire German-speaking region the German National Museum collects and maintains cultural, artistic and historical testimonials from the beginning of history to the present. As a research and educational institution of international standing, the collections, exhibitions and publications present the cultural history of the German-speaking countries in an international and interdisciplinary approach. The work of the institution is guided by the principle of respect for all cultures, so that all human beings can understand what the museum communicates, independent of their upbringing, education, and religious beliefs. == Buildings == Courtyard of the Carthusian cloister at the time of the foundation of the GNM, 1852 The museum constitutes an architectural monument in itself, as it consists of a variety of buildings erected in different periods. It incorporates the remaining structures of the former Nuremberg Charterhouse (), dissolved in 1525 and thereafter used for a variety of secular purposes until in 1857 what was left of these premises, by then badly dilapidated, was given to the Museum. The charterhouse was rebuilt and modified to accommodate the collections until the late nineteenth century when Neo-Gothic extensions were added on its south side. During and after the First World War, the \u201eAlter Eingang\u201c (Old Entrance) and the \u201eGaleriebau\u201c (Gallery building) designed by German Bestelmeyer were built to provide an entrance from Kornmarkt and further space.J\u00f6rn Bahns, Die Museumsbauten von der \u00dcbernahme der Kartause im Jahre 1857 bis gegen 1910 \u2013 History of the museum buildings from the takeover of the Charterhouse to around 1910 In: Deneke/Kahsnitz (Ed.) 1978, p. 357 After the destructions during the Second World War, Sep Ruf designed additional buildings; historical parts of the halls and galleries were adapted to the new architectural concept or torn down after their destruction during the war; only some buildings were restored and rebuilt. The first major building was added 1955\u20131958, called \u201eHeussbau\u201c after the first president of West Germany, Theodor Heuss. In 1983, and from 1988\u20131993, the museum was substantially enlarged. The \u201eKart\u00e4userbau\u201c with the new entrance hall situated now on Kart\u00e4usergasse was designed by Jan St\u00f6rmer of architects ME DI UM. In 1999, the 1910 building of the St Lorenz's parish children's home was acquired. It was restored in 2002, and is now the home for the Collection of Children's Toys. == Collection == The collection is displayed in the following sectionsGNM's museum map (denominated here as by the GNM): {| |- | style=\"width:60%\" | \u2022 History of the GNM || \u2022 Scientific Instruments |- | \u2022 Prehistory and Ancient History || \u2022 Medecine and Crafts |- | \u2022 Middle Ages || \u2022 Decorative Arts before 1800 |- | \u2022 Late Middle Ages || \u2022 Fashion and Clothing since 1700 |- | \u2022 Everyday Culture up to 1700 || \u2022 Folk Art |- | \u2022 Arms and Armour, Hunting, Garden Culture || \u2022 19th Century |- | \u2022 Musical Instruments || \u2022 20th Century |- | \u2022 Museum of Applied Arts || \u2022 Toys |- | \u2022 Renaissance, Baroque Enlightenment || |} Some random examples of the collection are shown here: File:GNM - Goldkegel Etzelsdorf 1.jpg|Golden hat of Ezelsdorf-Buch, c. 1000 BC File:Ostgoten-fibel.jpg|Ostrogothic eagle-shaped fibula, c. 500 File:Coperta del codex aureus, treviri, 985-987, 01.JPG|Codex Aureus, 985-987 File:Astolabio di ahmad ibn muhammad al-naqqash, ottone inciso, saragozza, 1079-1080.JPG|Astrolabe, c. 1080 File:Grabfigur des Grafen Heinrich der III. von Sayn, um 1247-48 GNM Nuernberg-3.jpg|Tomb Statue, c. 1248 File:1300 Maria in der Erwartung anagoria.JPG|The Expectant Mary;
