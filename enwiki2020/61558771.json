The village is located south of Kohima, the capital of Nagaland. == Etymology == The name \"Kigwema\" originates from words of Khonoma village dialect, \"Ki\" meaning \"House\", \"Gwe\" meaning \"inherit or occupy\" and \"ma\" meaning \"people\". Literally, Kigwema means people who inherit or occupied the houses. == History == Kigwema is one of the oldest villages amongst the Angami Naga villages.

The Japanese commander, General K\u014dtoku Sat\u014d, was stationed in Kigwema during the Battle of Kohima. \u201cIt was a long war, we were warned by the Brits and were very apprehensive about the Japanese, but they were friendly. They lived with the families, paid for everything and unlike the British, they had no relationships with local women. They never misbehaved. General Saito was a very nice man. For us teenagers, the war was an adventure,\u201d recalled Kuose Kere an elder from Kigwema village who witnessed the invasion of Japanese troops.https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and- culture/that-battle-under-the-cherry-tree/article4695744.ece == Geography and climate == Kigwema is nestled in the foothills of Mt.
