His first posting was to 39 (Beaufort) Squadron, flying torpedo bomber sorties against enemy shipping in the Mediterranean Theatre. From 39 Squadron Bullen then moved to 458 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force operating Wellington Bombers. ===George Medal=== It was while serving with 458 Squadron that Bullen carried out the action for which he was awarded the George Medal in the spring of 1944. Returning from an operation over Italy, Bullen's aircraft suffered an engine failure as it approached its home airfield and crashed. He was thrown clear, receiving severe injuries to his arms, back and legs. In spite of this he made his way into the burning wreckage and rescued the wireless operator. Bullen received burns in addition to his other injuries. ==Later service== Once recovered from his injuries, Bullen was certified as unfit for active service. He was reassigned to administrative duties and rose through the ranks. His rise took him to the post of Adjutant-General HQ Allied Air Forces Central Europe between 1965 and 1968. The last RAF appointment Bullen held was Air Officer Administration, Training Command between 1972 and 1975. It was from this post that he retired from the air force and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Recipients of the George Medal Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:British airmen Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing ",
