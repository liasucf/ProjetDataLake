    "text": "FHM is a men's lifestyle magazine that is published in several countries. Its master edition contained features such as the FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World, which has featured models, TV presenters, reality stars and singers.http://www.fhm.com/posts/michelle-keegan-95580 The final printed issue of British FHM was in December 2015, after which the magazine moved to a digital-only platform, where topics such as dating tips, style advice, viral news, life hacks, sports and entertainment, among other things, were covered daily. High-profile names that have been published in the magazine include top models Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Anne Vyalitsyna, Miranda Kerr, Candice Swanepoel, Irina Shayk, and Emily Ratajkowski. ==History== The magazine began publication in 1985 in the UK under the name For Him Magazine and changed its title to FHM in May 1992, although the full For Him Magazine continued to be printed on the spine of each issue. The first woman to appear on the cover was Gina Davies in February 1993. The trend towards female cover stars grew over the following year, with both Naomi Campbell and Andie MacDowell appearing. Circulation expanded to newsagents as a quarterly by the spring of 1987 and then monthly in 1994. EMAP Consumer Media bought the magazine in 1994 and it subsequently went on to dominate the UK men's market and began to expand internationally, being published in 32 countries including India. On 17 November 2015, British FHM announced their intention to suspend publication alongside that of fellow men's magazine ZOO; while the website would still be updated online. In August 2016, under the guidance of BauerXcel Media, a property of Bauer Media Group, Nick Dimengo took over as the senior editor of FHM.com. FHM.com was subsequently shut down and redirected to Bauer's competition website, Win Something. ==FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World== Each of FHMs international editions publish yearly rankings for the sexiest women alive based on public and editorial voting through the magazine's website.
