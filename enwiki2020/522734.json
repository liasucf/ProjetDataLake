    "text": "Kevin Price Phillips (born November 30, 1940) is an American writer and commentator on politics, economics, and history. Formerly a Republican Party strategist before becoming an Independent, Phillips became disaffected with the party from the 1990s, and became a critic. He is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times, Harper's Magazine, and National Public Radio, and was a political analyst on PBS' NOW with Bill Moyers. Phillips was a strategist on voting patterns for Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign, which was the basis for a book, The Emerging Republican Majority, which predicted a conservative political realignment in national politics, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential recent works in political science. His predictions regarding shifting voting patterns in presidential elections proved accurate, though they did not extend \"down ballot\" to Congress until the Republican revolution of 1994. Phillips also was partly responsible for the design of the Republican \"Southern strategy\" of the 1970s and 1980s. The author of fourteen books, he lives in Goshen, Connecticut. ==Southern strategy== Phillips worked for Richard Nixon's presidential campaign in 1968, and afterwards wrote a book on what has come to be known as the \"Southern strategy\" of the Republican Party. The book was entitled The Emerging Republican Majority and argued that the southern states of the US would keep the Republicans winning Presidential Elections and more than offset the Northeast states, based on racial politics. As he stated to the New York Times Magazine in 1970, > All the talk about Republicans making inroads into the Negro vote is > persiflage. Even 'Jake the Snake' [Senator Jacob Javits of New York] only > gets 20 percent. From now on, Republicans are never going to get more than > 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote, and they don't need any more than > that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened the Voting > Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the > sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. > That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the > whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local > Democrats. The book however wasn't used in the campaign itself, Phillips notes in the preface to the Princeton Edition, > Some observers concluded that The Emerging Republican Majority was the > emerging Republican strategy. Newsweek labeled the book \"The political bible > of the Nixon Era.\" Not quite. The book was not a blueprint of the GOP's > \"Southern Strategy\" as some claimed,. ... Richard Nixon had read memos based > on the book's analyses during the week before the November 1968 election, > but in mid-1969 he truthfully said he had not read the actual book. He read > it a few months later. ==Books== ===American Theocracy (2006)=== Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan page, Brown University website states the book's theme is that the Republican Party (GOP), religious fundamentalism, petroleum, and borrowed money are an \"Unholy Alliance.\"Callahan, Allen Dwight, \"Unholy Alliance\", Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, No. 1008, October 25, 2006. The last chapter, in a nod to his first major work, is titled \"The Erring Republican Majority\". American Theocracy, which \"presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism, catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility, rampant greed and dangerous shortsightedness.\" The New York Times wrote: > He identifies three broad and related trends \u2014 none of them new to the Bush > years but all of them, he believes, exacerbated by this administration's > policies \u2014 that together threaten the future of the United States and the > world.

Phillips uses the term financialization to describe how the U.S. economy has been radically restructured from a focus on production, manufacturing and wages, to a focus on speculation, debt, and profits. Since the 1980s, Phillips argues in American Theocracy, > the underlying Washington strategy\u2026 was less to give ordinary Americans > direct sums than to create a low-interest-rate boom in real estate, thereby > raising the percentage of American home ownership, ballooning the prices of > homes, and allowing householders to take out some of that increase through > low-cost refinancing. This triple play created new wealth to take the place > of that destroyed in the 2000-2002 stock-market crash and simultaneously > raised consumer confidence. Nothing similar had ever been engineered before. > Instead of a recovery orchestrated by Congress and the White House and aimed > at the middle- and bottom-income segments, this one was directed by an > appointed central banker, a man whose principal responsibility was to the > banking system. His relief, targeted on financial assets and real estate, > was principally achieved by monetary stimulus. This in itself confirmed the > massive realignment of preferences and priorities within the American > system\u2026. Likewise, huge and indisputable but almost never discussed, were > the powerful political economics lurking behind the stimulus: the massive > rate-cut-driven post-2000 bailout of the FIRE (finance, insurance, and real > estate) sector, with its ever-climbing share of GDP and proximity to power. > No longer would Washington concentrate stimulus on wages or public-works > employment. The Fed's policies, however shrewd, were not rooted in an > abstraction of the national interest but in pursuit of its statutory mandate > to protect the U.S. banking and payments system, now inseparable from the > broadly defined financial-services sector. ====Critical reception==== American Theocracy was reviewed widely. The New York Times Book Review wrote \"It is not without polemic, but unlike many of the more glib and strident political commentaries of recent years, it is extensively researched and frighteningly persuasive...\"Alan Brinkley, The New York Times Book Review, March 19, 2006 The Chicago Sun-Times wrote \"Overall, Phillips' book is a thoughtful and somber jeremiad, written throughout with a graceful wryness... a capstone to his life's work.\"William O'Rourke, The Chicago Sun-Times, March 12, 2006. ===Bad Money (2008)=== Phillips examines America's great shift from manufacturing to financial services. He also discusses America's petroleum policies and the tying of the dollar to the price of oil. Phillips suggests that the Euro and the Chinese Yuan/Renminbi are favorites to take the dollar's place in countries hostile towards America, like Iran. He then tackles the lack of regulatory oversight employed in the housing market and how the housing boom was allowed to run free under Alan Greenspan. The book concludes with the proposal that America is employing bad capitalism and extends Gresham's Law of currency to suggest that our good capitalism will be driven out by the bad.Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism (2008); ==Bibliography== * The Emerging Republican Majority (1969) * Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age (1974) * Electoral Reform and Voter Participation (with Paul H.
