    "text": "George Lloyd Murphy (July 4, 1902 \u2013 May 3, 1992) was an American dancer, actor, and politician. Murphy was a song-and-dance leading man in many big- budget Hollywood musicals from 1930 to 1952. He was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946, and was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1951. Murphy served from 1965 to 1971 as U.S. Senator from California, the first notable U.S. actor to be elected to statewide office in California, predating Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.In 1944, Democrat Jimmie Davis (1899\u20132000)\u2014popularizer of \"You Are My Sunshine\"\u2014was elected to his first term as Governor of Louisiana. In 1948 Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff won the Republican nomination for Governor of Tennessee but was defeated in the general election. Helen Gahagan Douglas served in the House of Representatives from 1945-51. He is the only United States Senator represented by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. ==Early life== Murphy was born in New Haven, Connecticut, of Irish Catholic extraction, the son of Michael Charles \"Mike\" Murphy, athletic trainer and coach, and the former Nora Long. He was educated at Trinity-Pawling School, Peddie School and Yale University in his native New Haven.George Lloyd Murphy, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Accessed February 27, 2011. He worked as a tool maker for the Ford Motor Company, as a miner, a real estate agent, and a night club dancer. ==Film career== In movies, Murphy was known as a song-and-dance man and appeared in many big-budget musicals such as Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937), Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940) and For Me and My Gal (1942). He made his movie debut shortly after talking pictures had replaced silent movies in 1930, and his career continued until he retired as an actor in 1952, at the age of 50. During World War II, he organized entertainment for American troops. In 1951, he was awarded an honorary Academy Award. He was never nominated for an Oscar in any competitive category. He was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946. He was also a vice president of Desilu Productions and of the Technicolor Corporation. He was director of entertainment for presidential inaugurations in 1953, 1957 and 1961. ==Political career== Murphy entered politics in 1953 by joining the leadership of the California Republican Party, having also directed the entertainment for the Eisenhower-Nixon inauguration that same year. In 1964, he was elected as a Republican to the Senate, having defeated Pierre Salinger, the former presidential press secretary in the Kennedy White House, who had been appointed several months earlier to serve the remainder of the late Clair Engle's unexpired term. Murphy served from January 1, 1965 to January 3, 1971. Murphy assumed his seat two days early, when Salinger resigned from the seat to allow Murphy to gain an edge in seniority. Murphy was then appointed by Democratic Governor Pat Brown to serve the remaining two days of Salinger's term. His election attracted the attention of satirist Tom Lehrer, who wrote and performed a song about him, in response to racist comments about Mexican-Americans made by Senator Murphy in support of the extension of the Bracero Program in 1964: \"You have to remember that Americans can't do that kind of work. It's too hard. Mexicans are really good at that. They are built low to the ground, you see, so it is easier for them to stoop.\" Murphy was in demand for a time to assist other Republican candidates seeking office. In 1966, he hosted a fundraising dinner in Atlanta, Georgia for US Representative Howard \"Bo\" Callaway, the first Republican candidate for Governor of Georgia since Reconstruction. In the election, Callaway outpolled Democrat Lester Maddox, but did not get a majority, and the state legislature elected Maddox.Billy Hathorn, \"The Frustration of Opportunity: Georgia Republicans and the Election of 1966\", Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South, XXXI (Winter 1987-1988), pp. 42, 47 In 1967 and 1968, Murphy was the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. During his Senate term, Murphy developed throat cancer, and part of his larynx had to be removed. For the rest of his life, he was unable to speak above a whisper. Murphy voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. In 1970, Murphy ran for re-election; he was challenged by Democratic US Representative John V. Tunney, the son of famed heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney. Murphy's surgery and staunch support for the lingering Vietnam War worked against him, as did reports that he had continued to receive a salary from Technicolor after taking office. Tunney's successful Senate race in 1970 was reportedly the inspiration for the 1972 Robert Redford film The Candidate.Christensen, Terry, and Hass, Peter. Projecting Politics: Political Messages in American Films, p. 146 ==Death== Murphy subsequently moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he died at the age of 89, from leukemia. ==Legacy== Murphy's move from the screen to California politics paved the way for the successful transitions of actors such as Ronald Reagan and later Arnold Schwarzenegger. Reagan once famously referred to George Murphy as his own \"John the Baptist\". Fellow Republicans praised Murphy's ability to speak at fundraising dinners and so consequently backed his bid to become the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee. During his tenure in the Senate, Murphy created the candy desk by placing a supply of confectionery on his desk on the US Senate floor. After 1971, the candy-desk duties were bequeathed to a string of successors; since 2015, the keeper of the candy desk has been Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey. ==Personal life== Murphy was married to his ballroom dancing partner, Juliette \"Julie\" Henkel-Johnson, from December 18, 1926 until her death, in 1973. They had two children: Dennis Michael Murphy and Melissa Elaine Murphy. He was married to Bette Blandi from 1982 until his death in 1992, she died in 1999. ==Radio== * Suspense (episode \"Death on Highway 99\" 1945) * Lux Radio Theatre (episode Royal Wedding 1952) ==Films== in the film London by Night (1937) * Kid Millions (1934) as Jerry Lane * Jealousy (1934) as Larry O'Roarke * I'll Love You Always (1935) as Carl Brent * After the Dance (1935) as Jerry Davis * The Public Menace (1935) as Edward Joseph 'Red' Foster * Woman Trap (1936) as Keat Shevlin * Top of the Town (1937) as Ted Lane * London by Night (1937) as Michael Denis * Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937) as Sonny Ledford * The Women Men Marry (1937) as Bill Raeburn * You're a Sweetheart (1937) as Hal Adams * Little Miss Broadway (1938) as Roger Wendling * Letter of Introduction (1938) as Barry Paige * Hold That Co-ed (1938) as Rusty * Risky Business (1939) as Dan Clifford * Broadway Melody of 1940 (1940) as King Shaw * Two Girls on Broadway (1940) as Eddie Kerns * Public Deb No. 1 (1940) as Alan Blake * Little Nellie Kelly (1940) as Jerry Kelly * A Girl, a Guy, and a Gob (1941) as Coffee Cup * Tom, Dick and Harry (1941) as Tom * Ringside Maisie (1941) as Skeets Maguire * Rise and Shine (1941) as Mo McGonigle * The Mayor of 44th Street (1942) as Joe Jonathan * For Me and My Gal (1942) as Mo K.
