The hamlet belongs to the village of Kopaniec (prior Seifershau). Prior to 1945 it was in Germany, and was known as Ramrich or Kolonie Ramberg. It lies approximately south-west of Stara Kamienica, west of Jelenia G\u00f3ra, and west of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw. The village was founded around a mill on the river Kamienica (Kemnitz) at the foot of the Trzciniak mountain (Ramberg). In the first half of the 18th century a hunter's house was located here in the property of the Schaffgotsch family. Later a mill was built by the Schaffgotsch family as well as a settlement. Near the mill was a famous restaurant called Die Rambergschenke. In 1978 there were six farms in Miedzylesie. In 2008 there were four houses - one of them houses the Nemoland international cultural centre. ==External links== * Nemoland Category:Villages in Jelenia G\u00f3ra County ",
