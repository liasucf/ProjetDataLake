He won twice on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2019 when he topped the regular season points list. In 2017, along with Dou Zecheng, he was one of the first Chinese players to gain their card on the PGA Tour. ==Amateur career== Zhang represented China at the 2010 Asian Games. ==Professional career== Zhang turned professional in 2010. Having won on the PGA Tour China in 2014 he qualified to join the second tier Web.com Tour in 2015 after finishing second on the Order of Merit. However, towards the end of the season he was banned for six months after having been found guilty of signing for incorrect scores on two occasions, and ultimately stayed in China for another season. The following year he won again and finished third on the Order of Merit to again earn his place on the Web.com Tour for 2016. Having found limited opportunities on the Web.com Tour in 2016, Zhang again returned to China. He finished 5th on the Order of Merit to earn a return to the Web.com Tour. He played in all regular season tournaments and finished 20th on the Web.com Tour points list in 2017 to graduate to the PGA Tour for 2018. He did not manage to win enough points to retain his place on the PGA Tour during his rookie season and dropped back to the second tier for 2019. Zhang claimed two victories on the now renamed Korn Ferry Tour in 2019, at the Dormie Network Classic and the Lincoln Land Championship, and finished the season on top of the regular season points list to regain his card on the PGA Tour for the 2019\u201320 season. ==Professional wins (6)== ===Korn Ferry Tour wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|28 Apr 2019 |Dormie Network Classic |\u221226 (63-64-65-70=262) |5 strokes | Lanto Griffin, Chase Seiffert |- |align=center|2 |align=right|16 Jun 2019 |Lincoln Land Championship |\u221215 (68-72-63-66=269) |Playoff | Dylan Wu |} Korn Ferry Tour playoff record (1\u20130) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\" |align=center|1 |2019 |Lincoln Land Championship | Dylan Wu |Won with birdie on third extra hole |} ===PGA Tour China wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|15 Jun 2014 |Beijing Open |\u221219 (66-66-70-67=269) |2 strokes | Matthew Perry |- |align=center|2 |align=right|18 Oct 2015 |Chongqing Jiangnan NewTown KingRun Open |\u221215 (69-74-65-65=273) |4 strokes | Bryden Macpherson |} ===China Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|25 Nov 2018 |Chongqing Kingrun Open |\u221216 (68-71-67-66=272) |8 strokes | Zhang Jia |} ===Other wins (1)=== * 2012 China Tour Final ==Results in major championships== Results not in chronological order in 2020. {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2020 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |CUT |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |} CUT = missed the half-way cut NT = No tournament due to COVID-19 pandemic ==Results in World Golf Championships== Results not in chronological order before 2015. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Tournament!! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 !! 2018 !! 2019 |- |align=\"left\"|Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=\"left\"|Match Play |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=\"left\"|Invitational |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=\"left\"|Champions |T13 |T56 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T46 |T21 |T44 |T50 |T38 |} \"T\" = tied ==Team appearances== Professional *World Cup (representing China): 2011 ==See also== *2017 Web.com Tour Finals graduates *2019 Korn Ferry Tour Finals graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Zhang Xinjun at the China Tour official site * Category:Chinese male golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Sportspeople from Shanxi Category:Sportspeople from Guangdong Category:1987 births Category:Living people ",
