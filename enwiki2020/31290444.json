In April 2012, CCFC stated it would no longer field a team in future seasons, thereby folding. ==Club== Capital City FC was a non-profit organisation meant to enrich soccer at all levels in the National Capital Region. The club funded local youth soccer clubs, and had Ottawa South United as its official youth club partner. In addition, CCFC was very active in recruiting local players from local universities and colleges, as well as amateur clubs. Soccer is one of the most popular recreational sports in Ottawa, but clubs like Toronto FC and the Montreal Impact don't do very much scouting there, and so the city has a very large untapped pool of soccer talent. In this way, Capital City worked as a gateway to the bigger clubs in Canada and around the world. ==Players and Staff== ===Senior Roster=== As of December 12, 20125 ccfc players earn new pro contracts ===Team Staff=== as of March 12, 2013 Shaun Anthony Harris- Head Coach and Technical Director ==Attendance== Capital City lead the CSL in average attendance, attracting over 1,000 fans to most of their home games. Peak attendance is believed to have been over 1,700 for their 2011 Givova Cup Semi-Final match against the Serbian White Eagles, a 5-0 win. Capital City FC's supporters group is called \"Bytown Boys Supporters Club\". The Bytown Boys bring much energy to CCFC home games and use popular chants used by Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps supporters' groups, in addition to original chants. ==Year-by-year== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !League !Playoffs |- | 2011 |3rd |Runners-up |} ==References== ==External links== Category:Association football clubs established in 2011 Category:Canadian Soccer League (2006\u2013present) teams Category:2011 establishments in Ontario Category:Soccer clubs in Ottawa ",
