    "text": "Specialist Group Information Services (SGIS) (known as the 254 (Specialist Group Information Services) Signal Squadron until 1 March 2019) is a British Army Reserve unit which recruits from across the United Kingdom. Currently the headquarters and other elements of its parent unit 15th Signal Regiment (Information Support) are located in Blandford Camp. SGIS became part of 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment in 2019, before moving to the recently re-reformed 13 Signal Regiment in July 2020. ==Role== As an outcome of the UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) of 2010, the Future Reserves 2020 (FR20) consultation paper Delivering the Nation\u2019s Security Together, published in late 2012 explained how the Army Reserve needed to almost double in size to a trained strength of 30,000. Particular emphasis was placed upon the requirement for many more specialists, i.e. reservists who are recruited primarily for their professional expertise and skills which are in short supply in the Regular Army. 254 (SGIS) Signal Squadron provides consultancy- style expertise in relation to both Information Management and Information Exploitation in support of the Army and UK Defence as a whole, with their increasing reliance on technology. ==Training, development and capability delivery== The unit typically assembles six or seven times each year for military training, unit development, educational and multi-stream capability delivery purposes. In addition, it undertakes a multitude of tasks for a range of customers, from as little as a day in duration to many months. All individuals are required to pass military annual training tests, be proficient in basic close combat skills, develop an awareness of the wider army and its Land environment client base, gain an understanding of Royal Corps of Signals and army culture and be able to work in small teams. All individuals complete a minimum of 19 days of training per year, which should include military training and the execution of tasks for clients. ==Recruitment== The unit comprises mainstream Reserve officers, specialist officers, warrant officers (WOs) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). They recruit specialists directly from the commercial IT industry, but also many ex-regular soldiers plus those already serving in the UK Army Reserve who have the right skills. The unit rank range is lance corporal to WO1, then captain to lieutenant colonel. Typically they will recruit individuals with experience in either information assurance (IA) or information and communications services (ICS), skills which are in short supply in the regular army. == References == ==External links== *254 (SGIS) Signal Squadron *15th Signal Regiment (Information Support) Category:Squadrons of the Royal Corps of Signals Category:United Kingdom military unit and formation stubs Category:Information technology consulting firms of the United Kingdom Category:Army Reserve (United Kingdom) ",
