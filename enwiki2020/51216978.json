    "text": "A solar-powered waste compactor is a smart device that reads a waste bin's fill-level in real-time and triggers an automatic compaction of the waste, effectively increasing the bin's capacity by up to 5-8 times. The compaction mechanism runs on a battery, which is charged by the solar panel. Fully charged, the battery reserve lasts for approximately 3-4 weeks depending on the compaction frequency and usage patterns. Solar-powered waste compactors are typically connected to a remote software platform through wireless 2G/3G networks. The platform enables waste collection managers to access real-time data analytics and route optimization. Solar-powered compactors are primarily used in high foot traffic areas such as town centers, shopping malls, amusement parks, beaches, transit stations and sports stadiums. == Advantages == Some of the benefits of using solar-powered waste compactors include: * Reduced frequency of waste collections * Cleaner and more hygienic public spaces * Historical waste collection data analytics * Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions * Savings in operational waste collection costs == References == == See also == * BigBelly * Ecube Labs == External links == * Anta Swiss AG * BigBelly Solar * ECOnX * Ecube Labs * BritishBins SolaPacta Category:Waste management Category:Smart devices ",
