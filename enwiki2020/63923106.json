It was his idea to come up with an anthem about how the world would function post the coronavirus crisis. He suggested that I compose a tune and he would pen the lyrics for the same.\u201d Kamal Haasan asked two-three days time to write the lyrics but ended up giving it in just three hours. Ghibran revealed, \u201cWe started with Kamal sir\u2019s portion and recorded lines with other singers. The toughest part of the song lies in the chorus. I launched a talent hunt of sorts and chose 37 aspiring singers to sing the chorus. Co-ordinating with them made the whole process interesting and challenging.\u201d {| class=\"wikitable\" |2020 !\"Arivum Anbum\" |Himself | * Kamal Haasan (Lyricist) * Ghibran * Anirudh Ravichander * Yuvan Shankar Raja * Shankar Mahadevan * Bombay Jayashri * Sid Sriram * Devi Sri Prasad * Shruti Haasan * Andrea Jeremiah * Siddharth * Mugen Rao |The song was released on Think Music India YouTube channel on 23 April 2020. | | {| class=\"wikitable\" |+External video | colspan=\"2\" |Arivum Anbum - Official Video on YouTube |} |} == Release and reception == The song was released on Think Music India YouTube channel on 23 April 2020. == References == == External links == * Category:Songs about the COVID-19 pandemic ",
