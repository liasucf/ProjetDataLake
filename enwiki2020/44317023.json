At the same time, in 1963 the Class B tournament was shifted one tier down in the Soviet league system. In this way the third level competitions were revived for the first time since 1937. The structure of the tournament was preserved having separate competitions for Russia, Ukraine, and other Soviet republics. == Russian SFSR == The Russian Republican competition consisted of five zones of 20 clubs. The top two teams from each zone advanced to semi-final stage composed of two groups with five teams in each. The top two teams from those two groups advanced to final stage with a single group of four. The winner Volga Kalinin was promoted. ===Semifinals=== ====Grozny group==== ====Saratov group==== ===Finals=== == Ukrainian SSR == The Ukrainian Republican competition consisted of two zones of 20 clubs. Upon conclusion of the league format each club qualified for a playoff with another club that placed the same place in the other group.
