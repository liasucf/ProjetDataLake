    "text": "Olivia Lewis (born 29 April 1999) is an Australian netball player in the Suncorp Super Netball league, playing for the West Coast Fever. Lewis was born in Subiaco and raised in Wellard WA and was signed by the Fever ahead of the 2019 season. The defender grew up playing netball for the Rockingham District Netball Association before moving to Coastal Sharks academy in Western Australia. A prodigious junior talent saw her win national MVP awards at under 17 and 19 levels. Prior to being picked up by the Fever, she was MVP for the club's reserves team, the Western Sting in the Australian Netball League. She made her Suncorp super netball debut in round 1 of 2019 against Adelaide Thunderbirds, replacing the injured Courtney Bruce, and subsequently was her replacement over the next 3 weeks until Bruce returned fit. A promising first season saw her take to the court 9 times and culminated in her being selected in the 2019 Australian Development squad. A fit Courtney Bruce limited her appearances in 2020, however she was impressive enough in her 10 appearances to again be selected in the Australian Development squad for 2020/2021. ==References== ==External links== * West Coast Fever profile * Suncorp Super Netball profile * Netball Draft Central profile Category:Australian netball players Category:West Coast Fever players Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:Australian Netball League players Category:Suncorp Super Netball players Category:Netball players from Western Australia Category:Western Sting players Category:West Australian Netball League players ",
