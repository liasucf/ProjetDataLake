In 1917, his family moved to the United States, and in 1924, Emanuel Piore became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Piore obtained an undergraduate and a Ph.D. degree in physics, both from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.

Piore Award, for \"outstanding achievement in the field of information processing\". His daughter, Jane Piore Gilman, is a distinguished professor of mathematics at Rutgers University.
