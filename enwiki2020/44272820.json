    "text": "Carlos T. Mock (born January 16, 1956) is a Puerto Rican physician, gay activist, journalist, and writer who has published both works in the medical profession, works of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. ==Life== Mock was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He left Puerto Rico upon graduating from high school and attended The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he graduated cum laude in 1976 with a BA with a double major in chemistry and Spanish literature. He then attended The University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine in San Juan, where he obtained an MD in 1980. He then did a flexible internship at the USPH Service Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, and then did a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, graduating in 1985. Mock then joined a private place group at the Glen Ellyn Clinic, where he practiced obstetrics and gynecology until 1996. He developed an interest in infertility and twin pregnancies which led to the publication of a medical paper in the later topic. He is a Life Fellow of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a Life Member of the American Medical Association. Due to complications from HIV therapy, he became disabled in May 1996. He currently lives in Chicago, Illinois and Three Oaks, Michigan with his partner, Bill Rattan. ==Activism== While at practice in the Glen Ellyn Clinic, Mock experienced first-hand the discrimination in the workforce against GLBT physicians when one of his colleagues was fired for being gay. This, along with his HIV diagnosis, which forced him to retire, caused him to join the board of Equality Illinois, where he founded the Capitol Club., the fundraising arm of the organization, where he served from 2000 until 2009. His fundraising efforts were instrumental in the passage of the Human Rights Act of Illinois in 2005, prohibiting discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity in Illinois. For his work he was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 2007 ==Literary career== Mock started writing in 2001. He was first published in 2003 when Floricanto Press published Borrowing Time, A Latino Sexual Odyssey, which was later released in paperback in 2006. This was followed by five other publications. Since then he has contributed to The Chicago Tribune, Windy City Times, Ambiente Magazine (in Miami, Florida) and the web magazines: The Billerico Project and OpEd News. ==Publications== ===Articles=== * Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion Syndrome, acephalic presentating at full term, Robert Roger Lebel, MD, Carlos Mock, MD, Jeannette Israel, MD, William Senica, MD, Fetus Magazine. * Mock Views: The Death of a Great Pope * The New Faces of Puerto Rican Lesbian Activism * Puerto Ricans must address America's race and class divide * With these words, let us wed * Puerto Rican Sodomy Law \u2013 An Irony of Gay History * We are not equal \u2013 the abused second class Americans * Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV Rate * In the embrace of her family * The American Solution for Puerto Rico ===Books=== ====Fiction==== * Borrowing Time: A Latino Sexual Odyssey \u2013 Floricanto Press 2003.
