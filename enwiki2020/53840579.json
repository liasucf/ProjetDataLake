    "text": "Dunkerton Colliery Halt railway station served the colliery near the village of Dunkerton, Somerset, England from 1911 to 1925 on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. == History == The station opened on 9 October 1911 by the Great Western Railway, around a year after the line and the main stations had opened. It was, from the outset, a basic unmanned halt, and was intended to serve the villages of Tunley and Carlingcott as well as workers at the colliery itself. The station first closed to passengers on 22 March 1915, reopened on 9 July 1923 and closed again on 21 September 1925 to both passengers and goods traffic. The film The Titfield Thunderbolt was filmed on the line in summer 1952. The duel between the train and the steam roller was filmed in the disused sidings of the station where the film crew constructed a level crossing. == References == == External links == Category:Disused railway stations in Somerset Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1911 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1915 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1923 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1925 Category:1910 establishments in England Category:1925 disestablishments in England ",
