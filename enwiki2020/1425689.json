    "text": "Ticket to Ride is a railway-themed German-style board game designed by Alan R. Moon. It was illustrated by Julien Delval and Cyrille Daujean and published in 2004 by Days of Wonder. The game is also known as Zug um Zug (German), Les Aventuriers du Rail (French), Aventureros al Tren (Spanish), Wsi\u0105\u015b\u0107 do poci\u0105gu (Polish), and Menolippu (Finnish). The original version of the game is played on a board depicting a railway map of the United States and southern Canada. Localized editions have subsequently been published depicting maps of other countries, cities and regions. Players collect and play train car cards to claim train routes across the map. Points are earned based on the length of the claimed routes, whoever completes the longest continuous railway, and whether the player can connect distant cities that are determined by drawing ticket cards. The game won the 2004 Spiel des Jahres, the Origins Award for Best Board Game of 2004, the 2005 Diana Jones award, the 2005 As d'Or Jeu de l'ann\u00e9e, and placed second in the Schweizer Spielepreis for Family Games. Ticket to Ride: Europe won the 2005 International Gamers Award. As of August 2008, over 750,000 copies of the game had been sold according to the publisher. As of October 2014, over three million copies were reported sold, with retail sales of over $150 million. ==Gameplay== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1.0em;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCF\" align=\"left\" ! Card color !!

They are also dealt three Destination Ticket cards, each of which shows a pair of cities on a map of the United States and southern Canada. These become goals, representing two end- points which players are secretly attempting to connect. The player must keep at least two of these destination cards and discard unwanted tickets, if any, to the bottom of the stack. Once kept, a destination ticket may not be discarded for the rest of the game. Each player also selects a group of 45 colored train pieces with a matching scoring marker. Each turn, the player has to choose from one of three options: # draw two railway car cards in various colours from the draw piles (with the restriction that drawing a wild Locomotive card face up forfeits drawing another card), or # draw three additional destination ticket cards and keep at least one (replacing undesired tickets at the bottom of the stack), or # play their collected railway car cards from their hand to claim a route on the board and place the corresponding number of train pieces from their store on the claimed route, thereby earning points. The routes are of varying lengths (requiring varying numbers of matching coloured cards), and each discrete route marked on the board can be claimed by only a single player. Some cities are connected by two parallel routes that can each be claimed by a different player (unless the game is played by three or fewer players, in which case only one of the routes can be claimed). The same player may not claim both parallel routes between two adjacent cities. Longer routes are worth progressively more points than shorter routes, e.g., a route of length four is worth more than two routes of length two. On their turn, a player can claim any route anywhere on the board that has not already been claimed, regardless of whether the route helps to complete their destination tickets. The routes score points by themselves, as mentioned above, but routes not connected to a player's destination do not help them in reaching the destination or completing their destination ticket. The key to the game is getting the routes connected. Here the blue player has failed to claim the track between Duluth and Omaha, causing the route in the north to be disconnected and thus incomplete. The game ends when one player has only two or fewer of their supply of coloured train pieces. When this occurs, every player then plays one additional turn, after which they each reveal their previously hidden destination tickets. Additional points are awarded for having successfully connected the destinations on the cards, whereas points are subtracted for any incomplete tickets. A ten-point bonus is awarded to the player who has the longest continuously connected set of routes. ==Versions== Since the game's release in 2004, Days of Wonder has released additional stand-alone board games, expansion maps(require a base game to play), one card game, and multiple electronic game versions. ===Board games=== ===Base games=== ====USA==== The original game, released in 2004. In 2008, DOW released USA 1910, a card expansion for the original game. It contains additional destination tickets, and a full size replacement deck. =====Ticket to Ride: 10th Anniversary===== Released in 2014, Ticket to Ride: 10th Anniversary is a larger map of the original game (USA) and has metal boxes for the trains. There are no rule changes to the game, but the map and cars are larger and have been redesigned. The USA 1910 expansion is included in this version. ====Europe==== A game of Ticket to Ride: Europe at the start of the game. Released in 2005, Ticket to Ride: Europe takes place on a map of Europe as it was at the turn of the 20th century. The game includes two new types of route: Ferry routes, which require Locomotive cards to be played when claiming them, and Tunnel routes, which adds the risk that additional train cards may be necessary to complete the route. In 2009, DOW released Europe 1912, a card expansion for the European game. It contains additional destination tickets, and an additional play mechanic - Warehouses. ====M\u00e4rklin==== Days of Wonder released Ticket to Ride: M\u00e4rklin in 2006, based on a map of Germany. M\u00e4rklin is a German toy company, best known for model railways and technical toys. Whereas railway car cards of each type in the previous games were identical, the cards in Ticket to Ride: M\u00e4rklin each show a different image of M\u00e4rklin rolling stock. This edition features a passenger mechanic, where a passenger token is placed on the board and can claim point tokens by traveling along a player's route. ====Nordic countries==== In late October 2007, Days of Wonder released a local version of Ticket to Ride in the Nordic countries, and this version also became available in English, French and German. The game board is located in the Nordic countries, including parts of Russia and Estonia. It includes ferry routes and tunnels, like Ticket to Ride: Europe.

In 2015, Asmodee GmbH released Deutschland 1902, a card expansion for the German map. It contains additional destination tickets. In 2017, Ticket to Ride: Germany was released in the US. It is a combination of Zug um Zug: Deutschland together with Deutschland 1902. ====Rails & Sails==== A four- player game of Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails during play.

The card game is playable in 30\u201345 minutes and supports 2-4 players. Players start with 1 locomotive card and 7 other random train cards in their hand. Players are also dealt 6 destination tickets of which they must keep at least 1. The destination tickets have 1 to 5 colored dots which match the colors of the train cards. In order to complete a destination ticket, players must move cards from their hand, to their rail yard (playing area directly in front of the player), and finally to their on- the-track stack (scoring area). During play, players can \"train rob\" another player, by playing more of a specific color than their opponent has in their rail yard. When the train card draw piles are exhausted, the players use the train cards in their on-the-track stack to complete their destination tickets, by matching the colored train cards with the colored dots on the destination tickets. Completed tickets are added to the players score, while uncompleted tickets are subtracted. Additional bonus points are awarded to players who complete the most tickets to the six big cities, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Seattle. ===Computer games=== ====Ticket to Ride: Online==== Ticket to Ride and most expansions can be played online at Days of Wonder's website.

Mike Fitzgerald calls Ticket to Ride \"a game that I never tire of, one that lends itself well to the many expansions that Days of Wonder have released. The design principles it uses are all simple and have been done before, but they have never been put together in a game as compelling as Ticket to Ride.\" Board Game Quest mentioned that it is \"one of the greatest gateway games ever made\", and Board Games Land described it as \"one of the best family board games ever made\". Many of its expansions have also been positively received by critics. ==Awards and honours== ==References== ==External links== * Days of Wonder's Ticket to Ride site * Category:Railroad board games Category:Connection games Category:Spiel des Jahres winners Category:Origins Award winners Category:Alan R.
