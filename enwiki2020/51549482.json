It was established on 1 August 1958 by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority Act 1958 (BE 2501). Its governor is Mr Somchai Roadrungwasinkul. ==History== The first use of electricity on a significant scale in Thailand was the lighting of the Grand Palace on the occasion of the birthday of King Chulalongkorn's (Rama V) on 20 September 1884. The king took a great interest in electricity, particularly its potential for street lighting. Bangkok's first power plant was constructed by the German firm, AEG. It began producing power on 20 December 1913. A succession of power companies with concomitant name changes followed. Siam Electricity Company Limited was an early power company. In 1939 its name was changed to Thailand Electricity Corporation Company Limited. In 1950 its concession expired and it was taken over by the government, renaming it Bangkok Electricity Authority, operating under the aegis of the Interior Ministry. On 1 August 1958 the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) was established by merging the Bangkok Electric Works and the Electrical Division of the Public Works Department to be responsible for providing power supply in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan. For electricity provision in Thailand's other 74 provinces, it is supplied by the Provincial Electricity Authority. ==Operations== MEA maintains 18 district offices and 12 branch offices in its service area. Maximum demand for power peaked at 8,669 MW in 2014. ==Financials== In FY2014 (1 October 2013 \u2013 30 September 2014) MEA reported a net profit of 11,252 million baht on revenues of 200,603 million baht.
