    "text": "The American Ringtail is an experimental cat breed that derived from a California cat named Solomon. In 1998, owner Susan Manley started a breeding program to reproduce his unique curled tail, which she had also noted in other feral cats in northern California. This genetic mutation seems to have no ill health effects associated with it. The cats with curled tails were bred with Ragdoll cats and American Shorthair cats. Category:Cat breeds ",
