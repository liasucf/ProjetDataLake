    "text": "Plato (, Pl\u00e1t\u014dn, \"wide, broad-shouldered\"; c. 428/427 \u2013 c. 348/347 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, the second of the trio of ancient Greeks including Socrates and Aristotle said to have laid the philosophical foundations of Western culture. Little can be known about Plato's early life and education due to the very limited accounts. Plato came from one of the wealthiest and most politically active families in Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies. His father contributed everything necessary to give to his son a good education, and Plato therefore must have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era. ==Birthdate and birthplace== The specific birthdate of Plato is not known. Based on ancient sources, most modern scholars estimate that Plato was born between 428 and 427 BC. The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his Chronicles that Plato was born in the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 2 According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 3 If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he was born in the second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC).F.W. Nietzsche, Werke, 32 The Chronicle of Eusebius names the fourth year of the 89th Olympiad as Plato's, when Stratocles was archon, while the Alexandrian Chronicle mentions the eighty- ninth Olympiad, in the archonship of Isarchus.W. G. Tennemann, Life of Plato, 315 According to Suda, Plato was born in Aegina in the 88th Olympiad amid the preliminaries of the Peloponnesian war, and he lived 82 years. Sir Thomas Browne also believes that Plato was born in the 88th Olympiad.T. Browne, Pseudodoxia Epidemica, XII Renaissance Platonists celebrated Plato's birth on November 7.D. Nails, The Life of Plato of Athens, 1 Ulrich von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff estimates that Plato was born when Diotimos was archon eponymous, namely between July 29 428 BC and July 24 427 BC.U. von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff, Plato, 46 Greek philologist Ioannis Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, while Jonathan Barnes regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth. * For her part, Debra Nails asserts that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC. Plato's birthplace is also disputed. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius states that Plato \"was born, according to some writers, in Aegina in the house of Phidiades the son of Thales\". Diogenes mentions as one of his sources the Universal History of Favorinus. According to Favorinus, Ariston and his family were sent by Athens to settle as cleruchs (colonists retaining their Athenian citizenship), on the island of Aegina, from which they were expelled by the Spartans after Plato's birth there. Nails points out, however, that there is no record of any Spartan expulsion of Athenians from Aegina between 431 and 411 BC.D. Nails, \"Ariston\", 54 On the other hand, at the Peace of Nicias, Aegina was silently left under Athens control, and it was not until the summer of 411 that the Spartans overran the island.Thucydides, 5.18 * Thucydides, 8.92 Therefore, Nails concludes that \"perhaps Ariston was a cleruch, perhaps he went to Aegina in 431, and perhaps Plato was born on Aegina, but none of this enables a precise dating of Ariston's death (or Plato's birth)\". Aegina is regarded as Plato's place of birth by Suda as well. ==Family== Plato's father was Ariston, of the deme of Colytus. According to a tradition, reported by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius but disputed by Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Ariston traced his descent from the king of Athens, Codrus, and the king of Messenia, Melanthus.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 1 * U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Plato, 46 Codrus himself was a demigod fathered by the God of the sea Poseidon.The Great Books of the Western World. Dialogues of Plato, Biographical Note These claims are not however exploited in the philosopher's dialogues.D. Nails, \"Ariston\", 53 Plato's mother was Perictione, whose family boasted of a relationship with the famous Athenian lawmaker and lyric poet Solon. Solon's heritage can be traced back to Dropides, Archon of the year 644 b.c. Perictione was sister of Charmides and cousin of Critias, both prominent figures of the Thirty Tyrants, the brief oligarchic regime, which followed on the collapse of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian war (404\u2013403 BC).W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy', IV, 10 * A.E. Taylor, Plato, xiv * U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Plato, 47 Besides Plato himself, Ariston and Perictione had three other children; these were two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter, Potone, the mother of Speusippus (the nephew and successor of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy). According to the Republic, Adeimantus and Glaucon were older than Plato; the two brothers distinguished themselves in the Battle of Megara, when Plato could not have been more than 5 years old.Plato, Republic, 2.368a * U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Plato, 47 Nevertheless, in his Memorabilia, Xenophon presents Glaucon as younger than Plato.Xenophon, Memorabilia, 3.6.1 Ariston appears to have died in Plato's childhood, although the precise dating of his death is difficult.D. Nails, \"Ariston\", 53 * A.E. Taylor, Plato, xiv When Ariston died, Athenian law forbade the legal independence of women, and, therefore Perictione was given to marriage to Pyrilampes, her mother's brother (Plato himself calls him the uncle of Charmides),Plato, Charmides, 158a * D. Nails, \"Perictione\", 53 who had served many times as an ambassador to the Persian court and was a friend of Pericles, the leader of the democratic faction in Athens.Plato, Charmides, 158a * Plutarch, Pericles, IV Pyrilampes had a son from a previous marriage, Demos, who was famous for his beauty.Plato, Gorgias, 481d and 513b * Aristophanes, Wasps, 97 Perictione gave birth to Pyrilampes' second son, Antiphon, the half-brother of Plato, who appears in Parmenides, where he is said to have given up philosophy, in order to devote most of his time to horses.Plato, Parmenides, 126c Thus Plato was reared in a household of at least six children, where he was number five: a stepbrother, a sister, two brothers and a half-brother.D. Nails, The Life of Plato of Athens, 4 In contrast to his reticence about himself, Plato used to introduce his distinguished relatives into his dialogues, or to mention them with some precision: Charmides has one named after him; Critias speaks in both Charmides and Protagoras; Adeimantus and Glaucon take prominent parts in the Republic.W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, IV, 11 From these and other references one can reconstruct his family tree, and this suggests a considerable amount of family pride. According to John Burnet, \"the opening scene of the Charmides is a glorification of the whole [family] connection ... Plato's dialogues are not only a memorial to Socrates, but also the happier days of his own family\".C.H. Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue, 186 === Family tree === Note: John BurnetJohn Burnet, Greek Philosophy (1914, p. 351); cf. Charmides 154b gives Glaucon as Plato's grandfather. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius gives Aristocles as Plato's grandfather.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 4 ==Name== According to Diogenes, the philosopher was named after his grandfather Aristocles, but his wrestling coach, Ariston of Argos, dubbed him \"Platon\", meaning \"broad\" on account of his robust figure. Diogenes mentions three sources for the name of Plato (Alexander Polyhistor, Neanthes of Cyzicus and unnamed sources), according to which the philosopher derived his name from the breadth (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, platyt\u0113s) of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2, plat\u00fds) across the forehead. All these sources of Diogenes date from the Alexandrian period of biography which got much of its information from its Peripatetic forerunners.A. Notopoulos, The Name of Plato, 135 Recent scholars have disputed Diogenes, and argued that Plato was the original name of the philosopher, and that the legend about his name being Aristocles originated in the Hellenistic age. W. K. C. Guthrie points out that \u03a1lato was a common name in ancient Greece, of which 31 instances are known at Athens alone.For the use of the name Plato in Athens, see W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, IV, 10 For the suggestion that Plato's name being Aristocles was a fancy of the Hellenistic age, see L. Tar\u00e1n, Plato's Alleged Epitaph, 61 ==Legends== According to certain fabulous reports of ancient writers, Plato's mother became pregnant from a divine vision: Ariston tried to force his attentions on Perictione, but failed of his purpose; then the ancient Greek god Apollo appeared to him in a vision, and, as a result of it, Ariston left Perictione unmolested. When she had given birth to Plato, only then did her husband lie with her.Apuleius, De Dogmate Platonis, 1 * Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 1 * Another legend related that, while he was sleeping as an infant on Mount Hymettus in a bower of myrtles (his parents were sacrificing to the Muses and Nymphs), bees had settled on the lips of Plato; an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse philosophy.Cicero, De Divinatione, I, 36 ==Education== Portrait of Socrates, Roman marble (Louvre, Paris) Apuleius informs us that Speusippus praised Plato's quickness of mind and modesty as a boy, and the \"first fruits of his youth infused with hard work and love of study\".Apuleius, De Dogmate Platonis, 2 Later Plato himself would characterize as gifts of nature the facility in learning, the memory, the sagacity, the quickness of apprehension and their accompaniments, the youthful spirit and the magnificence in soul.Plato, Republic, 6.503c * U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Plato, 47 According to Diogenes, Plato's education, like any other Athenian boy's, was physical as well as mental; he was instructed in grammar (that is, reading and writing), music, painting, and gymnastics by the most distinguished teachers of his time.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 4\u20135 * W. Smith, Plato, 393 He excelled so much in physical exercises that Dicaearchus went so far as to say, in the first volume of his Lives, that Plato wrestled at the Isthmian games and did extremely well and was well known.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, iii. 5 Apuleius argues that the philosopher went also into a public contest at the Pythian games. Plato had also attended courses of philosophy; before meeting Socrates, he first became acquainted with Cratylus (a disciple of Heraclitus, a prominent pre-Socratic Greek philosopher) and the Heraclitean doctrines.Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1.987a According to the ancient writers, there was a tradition that Plato's favorite employment in his youthful years was poetry. He wrote poems, dithyrambs at first, and afterwards lyric poems and tragedies (a tetralogy), but abandoned his early passion and burnt his poems when he met Socrates and turned to philosophy.E. Macfait, Remarks on the Life and Writings of Plato, 7\u20138 * P. Murray, Introduction, 13 * W. G. Tennemann, Life of Plato, 315 There was also a story that on the day Plato was entrusted to him, Socrates said that a swan had been delivered to him. There are also some epigrams attributed to Plato, but these are now thought by some scholars to be spurious.A.E. Taylor, Plato, 554 Modern scholars now believe that Plato was probably a young boy when he became acquainted with Socrates. This assessment is based on the fact that Critias and Charmides, two close relatives of Plato, were both friends of Socrates. * P. Murray, Introduction, 13 * D.
