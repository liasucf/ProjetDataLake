W\u0142ast never denied nor rejected male identity, in contrast to the female one. == Biography == W\u0142ast's parents were Augustyn Komornicki and Anna Dunin-W\u0105sowicz, the grandparent was Teodor Anzelm Dzwonkowski (1764\u20131850). The writer came from an affluent landowning family, and spent the childhood in a property in Grab\u00f3w. In 1889 Anna Dunin-W\u0105sowicz came to Warsaw with hwr 6 children to grant them lessons from the best teachers (Pior was taught literature by prof. Piotr Chmielowski). W\u0142ast had a literary debut in a newspaper \"Gazeta Warszawska\" in 1892 with short stories Z \u017cycia n\u0119dzarza and Staszek. In 1883 the same newspaper published a novella Roz\u0142\u0105ka. In 1894 a collection of short stories Szkice was published, in the same year \u201eGazeta Pozna\u0144ska\u201d published a drama Skrzywdzeni. Then, under father's pressure, W\u0142ast went to Cambridge, to attend lectures at the Newnham College for six months. The diary of the stay was published under the ironic title Youth Paradise at the beginning of 1896. After return, W\u0142ast, Wac\u0142aw Na\u0142kowski and Cezary Jellenta published in 1895 a literary manifesto Forpoczty. In June 1898 a wedding with a poet Jan Lema\u0144ski took place.Lema\u0144ski, Jan \u2013 Encyklopedia PWN (internetowa) The marriage was considered unsuccessful, and Lema\u0144ski considered impetuous and morbidly jealous. According to Jan Lorentowicz's account, during his honeymoon, Lema\u0144ski shot his wife twice with a pistol at Krakow's Planty Park. The relationship broke up after two years. In 1900 W\u0142ast published (under the name Komornicka) Ba\u015bnie. Psalmodie, and in 1901 a cooperation with \"Chimera\" edited by Zenon Przesmycki started. The writer published poetry, including series Czarne P\u0142omienie (1901), prose (Biesy, 1902), translations from English, as well as reviews, signed \"W\u0142ast\". According to Maria Derna\u0142owicz, 1907 in the Bazar Hotel in Pozna\u0144 (during a trip with mother to Ko\u0142obrzeg) W\u0142ast burned women's dresses in the oven and declared himself a man. From then on, W\u0142ast wore only men's clothing, smoked a pipe, cut hair short, and had some teeth removed (to get a more masculine facial shape) and consequently used the name Piotr Odmieniec W\u0142ast. Prof. Bogdan Zakrzewski recalled that Piotr was a friendly and very interesting interlocutor, his only condition was using masculine forms, referring to him. W\u0142ast not only declared himself to be a man, but also recognized himself as the new incarnation of Piotr W\u0142ast, the legendary founder of the Dunin family (of Anna Dunin-W\u0105sowicz). Declared insane by family, W\u0142ast stayed in sanatoriums and hospitals in the years 1907\u20131914. In 1914 W\u0142ast returned to Grab\u00f3w, to begin writing his last work, Xi\u0119gi poezji idyllicznej (Books of Idyllic Poetry). By the end of his life he had become completely forgotten as a writer. In 1944, due to war damage, W\u0142ast left the family estate; he died in a medical establishment in Izabelin in 1949. His tombstone is located at the Pow\u0105zki Military Cemetery (as Maria Komornicka-Lema\u0144ska (section B / 20 (7/22)).Maria Komornicka-Lema\u0144ska, Moje Cmentarze == Legacy == The work of Piotr W\u0142ast (as Maria Komornicka) was published in 1996 by literary scholar Maria Podraza-Kwiatkowska. In the eighties Maria Janion published the essay \"Where is Lema\u0144ska?\" dedicated to W\u0142ast - its reprint in the book \u201eKobiety i duch inno\u015bci\u201d (1996), as well as the publication in this book of another sketch of Janion devoted to W\u0142ast \"Maria Komornicka, in memoriam\", caused increased interest of the young Polish writer among scholars. In the 21st century, W\u0142ast's renaissance took place \u2013 feminist critics, LGBT scholars, and journalists became interested in the writer's life and work. Noteworthy is the monograph (565 pages) Str\u0105cona Bogini by Brygida Helbig published in 2010 in Krakow. Wiktor Dynarski, transgender discourse scholar, stated that \"Maria Komornicka has never existed/been there.\". Marta Konarzewska, when writing the text about the writer published in \"Replika\" magazine - like Krzysztof Tomasik in Homobiografie, respected the name and gender identity chosen by the writer. Tomasik wondered in his book: \"The question remains whether W\u0142ast in his metamorphosis was more concerned about becoming a man or simply a human\" as at that time a woman was in fact a sub-human being, which was also pointed out by, among others, Zofia Na\u0142kowska. To mark the 60th anniversary of the poet's death, a monument was unveiled on 8 March 2009 by Gen. Stanis\u0142aw Na\u0142\u0119cz- Komornicki (poet's nephew) in the hometown of Grab\u00f3w nad Pilic\u0105. In July 2016, Warka celebrated the 140th anniversary of the birth of Maria Komornicka with the participation of Brygida Helbig and Tomasz Komornicki.Maria Komornicka - lipiec 2016 == Works == * Szkice.
