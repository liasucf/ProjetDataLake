The westernmost ripple of the greater Zagros mountains, the Hamrin mountains extend from the Diyala Governorate bordering Iran, northwest to the Tigris river, crossing northern Saladin Governorate and southern Kirkuk Governorate. In antiquity, the mountains were part of the frontier region between Babylonia to the south and Assyria to the north. Today, the area forms part of the linguistic boundary between most of Arab people of Iraq and Kurdish people of Iraq in the north. ==References== ==External links== * Jabal Hamrin - Iraq Category:Mountain ranges of Iraq Category:Zagros Mountains Category:Diyala Governorate Category:Kirkuk Governorate Category:Saladin Governorate ",
