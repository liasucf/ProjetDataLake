MMA given orally shows about 13-fold the progestogenic activity of parenteral progesterone in animal bioassays. Analogues of methenmadinone acetate include methenmadinone caproate (MMC), which was studied in combination with estradiol valerate as a combined injectable contraceptive (tentative brand name Lutofollin); chlormethenmadinone acetate (chlorsuperlutin; SCH-12600; 6-chloro-MMA),Sterba, R.
