The town hall, which is the headquarters of Havering London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The old court house (on the right) In the second half of the 19th century the local board of health was based in offices in the Market Place in Romford before acquiring the old court house of the independent liberty of Havering in the Market Place in 1892. The local board was restructured as an urban district in 1894 and, after the old court house became inadequate for their needs, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built town hall: the site selected in Main Road had previously been open land. The council relocated to temporary offices in South Street in 1931 while it waited for the new building to become available. The new building was designed by Herbert R Collins and Antoine Englebert O Geens in the International Moderne style and was officially opened as Romford Town Hall by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir George Broadbridge, on 16 September 1937. The district was also incorporated as a municipal borough that year and Broadbridge took the opportunity to present the charter of incorporation to the charter mayor, Councillor Charles Allen, on the same day. The design for the building, which had a Scandinavian element to it, involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing onto Main Road; it featured a tower on the left with a doorway and canopy on the ground floor and a tall window on the first floor flanked by flagpoles with a further flagpole on the roof; to the right were eleven bays with windows on each of the ground and first floors. The building was extended by three bays to the left in a similar style in 1960. Internally, the main rooms were council chamber and two large committee rooms. The building remained the local seat of government, and was renamed \"Havering Town Hall\", when the expanded London Borough of Havering was formed in 1965. Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh attended a civic lunch with council officials on 6 March 2003. In January 2016, following a debate in the council chamber, Havering Council became the first council in the UK to join the campaign to leave the European Union. The town hall was extensively restored and redecorated in autumn 2017. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Havering Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1937 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ",
