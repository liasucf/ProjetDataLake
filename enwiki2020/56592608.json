In 1153 he was certified as the chancellor of Prince Mieszko III Stary in the foundation privilege of the \u0141ekno Abbey. He was made Pozna\u0144 Bishop, on May 6, 1170, and together with Prince Mieszko, he founded a hospice at the Church of Saint Michael the Archangel in Poznan, which in 1187 was given to the Knights of Saint John. This foundation is mentioned in the document of his successor Benedict (c. 1192) and Jan D\u0142ugosz in his Annals. According to Rocznik Lubinski, Radwan assumed the Pozna\u0144 bishopric until 1172 as the successor of Cherubino, but at present it is believed that the order of these two bishops was mistaken in the Yearbook. ==References== Category:1172 deaths Category:Catholic bishops ",
