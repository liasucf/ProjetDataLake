    "text": "In Blue is the third studio album by Irish pop rock band The Corrs, released in 2000 which saw the band become known in the United States. The title of the album comes from a lyric in the song \"Give Me a Reason\". As well as the UK number one single \"Breathless\", the album also contains new versions of \"Radio\" and \"At Your Side\", which had previously appeared on their previous album The Corrs Unplugged. Mutt Lange co-wrote and produced three songs from the album and Tim Martin was the engineer for the album's tracks for their recordings at Westland Studios and Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin. Several of the tracks were used in various television programmes and films: \"Rebel Heart\" as the theme for the TV miniseries of the same name; \"One Night\" in Mad About Mambo; \"At Your Side\" in Say It Isn't So and the trailer for the film The Holiday; and \"All the Love in the World\" in the film America's Sweethearts. As of 2017, the album has sold 9 million copies worldwide. ==Track listing== ===Special edition=== ==Personnel== ===The band=== *Andrea Corr \u2013 lead vocals, tin whistle *Caroline Corr \u2013 drums, bodhran, piano, vocals *Jim Corr \u2013 guitar, keyboards, piano, vocals *Sharon Corr \u2013 violin, vocals ===Featuring=== *Anthony Drennan \u2013 guitars, lead guitar *Keith Duffy \u2013 bass guitar ===Guest musicians=== *Ronan Dooney \u2013 trumpet *Paul Duffy \u2013 saxophone *Mitchell Froom \u2013 keyboards *Billy Farrell \u2013 keyboards *Fiachra Trench \u2013 string arrangement ===Production=== *Producers: The Corrs, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, DFHM, Mitchell Froom, Billy Farrell, John Hughes *Engineer: Tim Martin *Assistant engineer: Frances Murphy *Mixing: Adam Olmsted, Mike Shipley *Pre-programming: Richard Meyer aka Swayd *Programming: Richard Meyer aka Swayd, Cory Churko, Oisin Murry *String arrangements: Fiachra Trench *Production consultant: Mitchell Froom *Art direction: Elizabeth Barrett *Design: Andrea Brooks *Photography: Rankin, Norman Jean Roy ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2000) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (RPM) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Czech Albums (\u010cNS IFPI) | 4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Danish Albums (Tracklisten) | 2 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|European Albums (Billboard) | 1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | 1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Irish Albums (IRMA) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Malaysian Albums (RIM) | 1 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP) | 1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (Prom\u00fasicae) | 1 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2000) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) | 11 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (\u00d63 \u00d6sterreich) | 6 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) | 12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) | 9 |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) | 12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista) | 129 |- !scope=\"row\"|French Albums (SNEP) | 22 |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (GfK) | 4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italian Album (FIMI) |align=\"center\"|27 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 15 |- !scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP) | 6 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Hitparade) | 7 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC) | 16 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Albums (Billboard) | 119 |} ===Decade-end chart=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2000\u201309) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|85 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Region !Date !Format |- |Australia |10 July 2000 |CD |- |rowspan=\"3\"|United Kingdom |17 July 2000 |CD, cassette |- |20 November 2000 |special edition CD and cassette |- |26 August 2002 |DVD audio |- |Argentina |1 June 2001 |CD |- |Germany |17 November 2000 |special edition CD |- |Japan |12 July 2000 |CD |} ==References== Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:143 Records albums Category:2000 albums Category:The Corrs albums Category:Albums produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange ",
