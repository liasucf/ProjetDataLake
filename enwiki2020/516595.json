    "text": "View of the Coliseum's seating during an Islanders game The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, commonly known as the Nassau Coliseum (or Nassau County Coliseum) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Uniondale, New York, east of New York City. The Long Island venue is approximately east of the eastern limits of the New York City Borough of Queens, and is also located next to the Meadowbrook Parkway. Opened in 1972, the Coliseum occupies of Mitchel Field, a former Army airfield, later an Air Force base. The facility is located in the Town of Hempstead, within the Uniondale 11553 ZIP code. The Coliseum is used for sporting events, concerts, large exhibitions and shows as well as trade shows\u2014 at the main arena, 60,000 at the Expo Center. In 2015, the arena was temporarily closed for a major renovation which was completed in April 2017. The New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) played at the Coliseum from 1972 to 2015 before moving to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. After the move proved to be commercially unsuccessful, the team split its home schedule between Barclays and the renovated Coliseum from 2018 to 2020 with plans to play the entire home portion of their 2020\u201321 season at the Coliseum. The Coliseum was also the home of the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), now known as the Brooklyn Nets, from 1972 to 1977. In 2017, the venue became the new home of the Brooklyn Nets' NBA G League team, the Long Island Nets. In June 2020, Nassau Coliseum was closed indefinitely as its owners sought new investors, putting the Islanders' plans to return to the arena full-time for the 2020\u201321 season in doubt. ==Sports== The Coliseum originally had a capacity of 13,000 to 15,000 depending on the event, and in the early 1980s the maximum capacity was increased to around 18,000. Before closing for renovations in 2015 the Coliseum seated 16,170 for hockey, up to 18,511 for concerts and 17,686 for boxing. Those renovations resulted in drastically reduced capacities: 13,917 for hockey and 16,500 for basketball. The Coliseum was home to the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association, and later the National Basketball Association, from 1972 to 1977. The first event at the Coliseum was a Nets game against the Pittsburgh Condors on February 11, 1972. The Nets won two ABA Championships in the Coliseum, with Hall of Famer Julius Erving headlining the team. In 1973\u201374 the Nets defeated the Utah Stars in five games to capture their first title. The Nets then captured the final American Basketball Association Championship in 1976, defeating the Denver Nuggets in six games. Following the 1976 season the Nets joined the National Basketball Association as part of the ABA\u2013NBA merger. After their first season in the NBA, the Nets moved to New Jersey. The New Jersey Nets played four seasons at the Rutgers Athletic Center before completion of the Meadowlands Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The Coliseum also hosted the New York Arrows and later the New York Express of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. The Arrows, which existed as a franchise from 1978 to 1984, won the first four MISL championships.Yannis, Alex. \"Arrows Fold Their Franchise\", The New York Times, July 25, 1984. Accessed June 9, 2018. \"The Arrows, a charter member of the Major Indoor Soccer League, have folded and filed for bankruptcy, developments which mean that the league will be without a franchise in the New York metropolitan area next season for the first time since it was formed in 1978.... Although league officials have expressed hope that the franchise might be revitalized at some unspecified future point, one thing is certain for now: The team that dominated M.I.S.L. play for the league's first four seasons, winning the championship in each of those years, no longer exists.\" The short-lived New York Express played part of the 1986\u201387 season, ending operations before the All-Star break with financial troubles and a 3\u201323 record.Yannis, Alex. \"Express Grinds To Halt As Soccer Team Files For Bankruptcy\", The New York Times, February 18, 1987.

It also has hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1982, 1994, and 2001. The New York Sets of World Team Tennis played their first match at Nassau Coliseum on May 7, 1974, and won the WTT championships in 1976. The team changed its name to the New York Apples for the 1977 season, and played 12 of its 22 home matches at Madison Square Garden and the Felt Forum, repeating as champions. Prior to the 1978 season, the Apples announced that they would leave the Coliseum and play all their home matches in the Madison Square Garden complex. The New York Raiders, intended by the fledgling World Hockey Association to be their flagship franchise, was slated to play in the new Nassau Coliseum in 1972\u201373. However, the Nassau County government did not consider the WHA a fully professional league and wanted nothing to do with the Raiders.Kilgannon, Corey. \"A Pro Hockey Team in the Early \u201970s Was Golden in Name Only\", The New York Times, October 26, 2012.

The Complete Historical and Statistical Reference to the World Hockey Association, 1972-1979, p. 25. Accessed June 9, 2018. \"The Raiders hoped to inhabit the new Nassau Coliseum being built in Uniondale, Long Island, whose only planned tenant as of 1972 was the ABA's New York Nets. The owners of the Nassau Coliseum were not too thrilled with having the Raiders play in their arena, and William Shea -- the man who helped attract the New York Mets to the nearby Flushing Meadows baseball stadium in 1962 -- was brought in to help secure a NHL franchise for the arena.... But with the advent of the WHA and the Raiders, the NHL quickly granted two new franchises in 1972 - one of which was the New York Islanders, who were to inhabit the Nassau Coliseum.\" On October 7, 1972, the first Islanders game in Nassau Coliseum was played as the Atlanta Flames visited the Islanders. Flames forward Morris Stefaniw scored the first NHL goal in the building at 6:56 of the first period, while Ed Westfall scored the first goal for the Islanders, as the Flames won the game 3\u20132. The first Islanders' home win at the arena was on October 12, 1972, where they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20132. The Islanders' first playoff win at the arena came on April 20, 1975, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4\u20132. On April 22, 1976, the Islanders earned their first playoff series victory at the arena by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 3\u20132, and winning the series 4\u20132.Staff. \"The ultimate New York Islanders timeline\", Newsday, October 11, 2014.

The Islanders were 11\u20131 in Stanley Cup Finals games at the Coliseum. Their only loss was a 1\u20130 setback in Game 1 in 1984 to the Edmonton Oilers. Islanders fans nicknamed the arena \"Fort Neverlose\" in honor of the team's strong home record during the finals.Vaccaro, Chris R. \"Requiem for the Coliseum: The Islanders' Last Stand at Fort Neverlose As the NHL Playoffs begin, the Isles and their fans hope to close out the only home they've ever known with a Stanley Cup\", Rolling Stone (magazine), April 13, 2015.

In 2000 and 2005, the Professional Bull Riders brought their Built Ford Tough Series (originally Bud Light Cup) to the Coliseum. On February 24\u201325, 2006, the Coliseum hosted the 44th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships. It was just the third time the annual event has been held on Long Island.

On April 25, 2015, the final Islanders game at Nassau Coliseum was held, Game 6 of their first round playoff series against the Washington Capitals. The game was won by the Islanders 3\u20131, forcing a Game 7 in Washington. Islanders' Nikolay Kulemin scored the final NHL game-winning goal at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum at 10:33 of the third period, a wrist shot against Braden Holtby. The Islanders' Cal Clutterbuck scored the final NHL goal at the Coliseum, an empty net goal that put the Islanders up 3\u20131 at 19:07 of the 3rd period. However, the Islanders were denied entry into the second round of the playoffs as they lost Game 7 of the series to the Capitals in Washington two nights later, thus making Game 6 the final major-league sporting event held at the Coliseum until the Islanders return three years later.

The arena had been considered obsolete for many years, and various Islanders owners tried to replace it. ===The Lighthouse Project=== Team and county officials announced in 2004 a plan called The Lighthouse Project to renovate the Coliseum. The project's centerpiece was a 60-story tower that would look like a lighthouse. Other plans included new housing, athletic facilities, a minor league baseball stadium, restaurants, and a hotel. The project would also add trees, water and other natural elements to the area. On August 14, 2007, Islanders owner Charles Wang and the Lighthouse Development Group partnered with Rexcorp to create a new plan. The 60-story \"lighthouse\" evolved into two 31-story buildings connected by a footbridge at the top. The project was transformed from a simple renovation of the Coliseum property into a transformation of surrounding properties. Plans called for more 2,000 residential units (20% affordable housing), a hotel, a convention center, a sports technology center, of retail space, and a sports complex next to the renovated Coliseum. The overall project was slated to cost roughly $3.75 billion. Construction was not planned to begin until at least mid-2009. Nassau County approved the Lighthouse Project in 2006 on a 16\u20132 vote, and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was completed after a state-mandated environmental review. The Lighthouse Project was then expected to go before the Town of Hempstead for approval on a change in land zoning. However, the approval was never granted. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the Long Island Press reported the Lighthouse Project's cancellation. Wang has denied the report. In May 2010, Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had discussions with Wang about constructing an arena for the Islanders near Citi Field. Wilpon has also discussed buying the Islanders. In June 2010, the FanHouse website reported Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who also worked on Madison Square Garden's latest renovation) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens. However, a source from Newsday indicated the FanHouse report was not true. There were also reports businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. ===2011 proposal to replace arena=== On July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an \"alternate zone\" for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property that downsized the Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and made the project, according to Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and the developers, \"economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site.\" As a result, Wang, Mangano and the developers decided they would no longer pursue the project. On May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for approval of a $400 million public bond issue for a new plan to replace the Coliseum. The plan, including the construction of a new $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league baseball ballpark nearby, was presented by Wang as a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders on Long Island. However, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal by a 57% to 43% margin on August 1, 2011. On October 24, 2012, the Islanders announced the team would move to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease expired at the end of the 2014\u20132015 season. The Islanders played their final game at the Coliseum on April 25, 2015, beating the Washington Capitals 3\u20131 in game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the Washington Capitals forcing a Game 7, held in and won by Washington, ending the Isles' run at the Coliseum; in Game 6 Cal Clutterbuck of the Islanders scored the final NHL goal in the building, an empty netter at 19:07 of the third period. ===Renovation=== Not long after the Islanders announced their move to Brooklyn, Forest City Enterprises, the owner of Barclays Center, was chosen to perform a study on development possibilities for the Nassau Coliseum site. A request for proposal was issued as a result of this study to transform the arena into a smaller sized venue and its surrounding parking lot into an entertainment hub with theaters, sports bars, and retail. Four competing proposals were submitted in May 2013, and Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano selected two finalists in July 2013, including one from a group led by Forest City Ratner. Ratner's proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum's capacity to 13,000 seats and a revamp of the arena's interior and concrete facade designed by SHoP Architects, the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million. As part of his bid, the Islanders would play 6 games per season in the arena, the Brooklyn Nets would play one exhibition game, and a minor league hockey team would call the arena home. On August 15, 2013, Nassau County announced Forest City had won the bid for the renovation of the Nassau Coliseum and the surrounding property, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and zoning changes from the Hempstead town government. The Nassau County legislature unanimously approved the bid on September 24, 2013. Billy Joel performed the arena's final pre-renovation concert on August 4, 2015. On April 5, 2017, a Billy Joel concert was the arena's first post-renovation event. Other acts that performed during the new Coliseum's opening week include Stevie Nicks, The Pretenders, Idina Menzel, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, and Marc Anthony. On November 4, 2016, Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment reached a naming rights deal with New York Community Bank. The cost of the naming rights and the agreement's length were not disclosed. The deal with the county mandates the inclusion of \"Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\" in the arena's name; it was branded as NYCB Live: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performed their final show at Nassau Coliseum on May 21, 2017. This was their only show at Nassau Coliseum post-renovation. The Islanders played a preseason game against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 17, 2017, their first appearance at the renovated Coliseum. ===Belmont Park arena and Islanders temporary return=== In late January 2017, Bloomberg News reported via internal sources that Barclays Center was considering dropping the Islanders due to poor attendance and their effects on the venue's profits. The venue has received a poor reception as a hockey arena due to poor sight lines and ice conditions, as Barclays was primarily designed as a basketball arena. Newsday reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with Ledecky, and he told the paper the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum. These reports were further elaborated by Long Island Association president Kevin Law in April 2017, who stated that Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment (who manages both venues) was preparing to offer a relocation plan to the team. Law felt that the alternate option of seeking a new arena in Belmont Park was redundant to the renovated Coliseum. The Islanders played a preseason game at the renovated Coliseum on September 17, 2017. The renovation project reduced the capacity of the arena to 13,900, a level which was believed to be unsustainable for an NHL team; in comparison, the Islanders' average attendance at Barclays is 12,059, the lowest in the NHL (Barclays Center is the second-smallest arena in the NHL based on seating capacity at 15,795, which is around 400 seats fewer than the Coliseum pre-renovation). As such, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman felt that returning wasn't a \"viable option\" for the Islanders, but noted that the team was \"in the process of evaluating what makes the most sense for the franchise and particularly for their fans.\" In December 2017, New York Arena Partners (a venture of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities) won a bid to construct a new, 18,000-seat arena and mixed-used district at Belmont Park, beating a competing proposal by New York City FC for a new soccer stadium. The new arena is projected to be completed in time for the 2021\u201322 season. In January 2018, Islanders owner Jon Ledecky revealed on WFAN's Boomer and Gio that he had toured the renovated Coliseum with Bettman and other senior NHL officials. They assessed that the Islanders could play a limited schedule of home games at the Coliseum, but that it wouldn't be sustainable as a full-time venue because of its capacity and diminished amenities (such as few corporate suites) over other newly built arenas. On January 23, 2018, it was reported that Barclays Center was pushing for a short-term lease under which the Islanders would split their home games between Barclays Center and the Nassau Coliseum until the Belmont Park arena is completed, with the number of games at the Coliseum steadily increasing for each year of the arrangement. On June 21, 2018, it was announced that the Islanders would play a portion of their home schedule at the Coliseum until the completion of the new arena, with 12 games moved in the 2018\u201319 season. The number of games during the 2018\u201319 season at the Coliseum was later increased to 20. The Islanders used the Coliseum as their home rink during the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs but moved back to the Barclays Center for the rest of the 2019 playoffs. In September 2019, it was announced that in the 2019\u201320 season, the Islanders would play 28 of their 41 home games at the Coliseum. On February 29, 2020, state governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders would play any home playoff games of the 2020 playoffs and all 2020\u201321 season home games at the Coliseum. But in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic terminated the 2019\u201320 season. As a result, all playoff games were played in Edmonton or Toronto. ===Closure=== In June 2020, Mikhail Prokhorov, whose company runs the Nassau Coliseum, announced that the arena would be closed indefinitely while it seeks new investors to take it over and assume the remaining debt. NYCB pulled out of its naming rights contract in late-August 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1972 establishments in New York (state) Category:American Basketball Association venues Category:Arena football venues Category:Basketball venues in New York (state) Category:Boxing venues in New York (state) Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:Convention centers in New York (state) Category:Former National Basketball Association venues Category:1998 Goodwill Games venues Category:Hempstead, New York Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in New York (state) Category:Indoor lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Indoor soccer venues in New York (state) Category:Legends Football League venues Category:Long Island Jawz Category:Long Island Nets Category:Mixed martial arts venues in New York (state) Category:NBA G League venues Category:New York Arrows Category:New York Islanders arenas Category:Professional wrestling venues in New York (state) Category:Sports venues in Hempstead, New York Category:Sports venues in Long Island Category:Sports venues in Nassau County, New York Category:Sports venues completed in 1972 Category:Tennis venues in New York (state) Category:Welton Becket buildings Category:Wrestling venues in New York (state) Category:New York Riptide ",
