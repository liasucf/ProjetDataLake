    "text": "Helen Milsted Eisenman (June 19, 1928 - May 26, 2017) was an American feature film subtitler who worked from the 1960s to the 1990s, becoming one of the best-known subtitlers in the United States. She has been referred to as the 'Queen of Subtitlers'. == Career == Eisenman was born c. 1928 in Austria to a Jewish family who had been shoemakers going back several generations. She fled Austria as a child with her family in 1937. The family moved to Italy, France, Portugal and eventually settled in New York in 1940. She worked in radio and film production before beginning to work as a subtitler in the 1960s. She went into semi-retirement in the 1990s, working part of the time in her Manhattan office and spending summers with her dog on Long Island. In the course of her career Eisenman worked on the subtitles of over 300 films. She speaks English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. She subtitled films shot in other languages as well, including Dutch, Danish, Chinese and Japanese, by editing the raw translations and turning them into subtitles. She worked on films by many eminent European directors including Pedro Almod\u00f3var and \u00c9ric Rohmer. She worked closely with Louis Malle, subtitling his films Au revoir les enfants, Le souffle au coeur and Milou en Mai. She subtitled a number of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated films including Babette's Feast, Belle \u00c9poque, The Restless Conscience: Resistance to Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945 and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. In interviews Eisenman tended to be pragmatic about translation: \"'The audience should be looking at the action, not reading. [...] Our job isn't that of the literary translator. Our job is to give the Cliff's Notes to a movie. In another interview she was quoted as saying \"You're looking for clarity. [...] You don't need to send telegrams, condense everything into two words. You try to get the flavor of everything within the limits of what you can show.'\" \"The audience should not have to figure out the subtitles. If they do, you've lost your audience. They should be able to think about what's being said.\" Eisenman also worked on dubbing projects, including the dubbing of the 1985 Argentinian film The Official Story, which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. == Films subtitled by Eisenman == # Zouzou (Marc All\u00e9gret, 1934) # Princesse Tam- Tam (Edmond T.
