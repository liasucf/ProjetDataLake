Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review praised the symphony, remarking, \"Bates has crafted a kaleidoscopic half-hour work, choosing an array of Borges\u2019 mythical creatures to paint in eleven interstiched sections.\" Johnson continued, \"Dedicated to Muti, Zoology is the 37-year-old composer's largest and most ambitious orchestral work to date, scored for huge forces and massive percussion battery. John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune also lauded the piece, writing: Georgia Rowe of the San Jose Mercury News called the piece \"scintillating\" and said, \"It's a large, panoramic 30-minute score, one that surges with vitality and glistens with alluring orchestral color.\" ==References== 4 Category:2015 compositions Category:21st-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ",
