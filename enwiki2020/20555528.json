    "text": "Velika Planina (; literally 'big pasture') is a dispersed high-elevation settlement of mostly herders' dwellings on the karst Big Pasture Plateau in the Kamnik Alps in Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==History== Velika Planina became an independent settlement in 1985, when it was administratively separated from neighboring \u017daga.Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia: Velika Planina ==Architecture== The mainly wooden huts and barns in the settlement have a particular architecture. They are single-room dwellings with shingled oval roofs extending nearly to ground level, making the space created by the extended roof suitable for sheltering livestock.Anton Cevc: Velika Planina on Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts site There are very few permanent residents in the settlement, but in the summer months it still has a sizable population of herdsmen who bring their flocks to the highland pastures. It is one of very few herders' settlements of this scale preserved in Europe and attracts visitors throughout the year with facilities for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. A number of houses to accommodate visitors have been built nearby.What to see on Velika Planina It is easily accessible by cable car from Kamni\u0161ka Bistrica. ==Church== Prior to 1939, the architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik prepared plans to build a church. The church design was modeled on the unique architecture of the surrounding huts. In 1939, the shepherds and dairymaids of Velika Planina used Ple\u010dnik's designs and built the Chapel of Our Lady of the Snows (Marija Sne\u017ena). Located just above the settlement, the small church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In the Second World War the chapel along with 100 other wooden dwellings were burnt down. The new chapel was built in 1988 and is particularly known for its Christmas Eve midnight mass.Slovenian Tourist Board site ==Gallery== Image:Hinko Smrekar - Velika planina s pastirskimi stanovi in bajtarji na smu\u010deh.jpg|Velika Planina in the winter - oil on canvas Image:Vel.planina (stanovi pozimi).JPG|Photograph of Velika Planina in the winter Image:Velika planina 031.JPG|Curved roof construction is traditional for the huts on Velika Planina ==References== ==External links== *Velika Planina at Geopedia *Velika Planina site Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Kamnik ",
