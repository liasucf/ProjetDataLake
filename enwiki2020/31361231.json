    "text": "Boogie-Doodle is a 1940 drawn-on-film visual music short by Norman McLaren, set to the boogie-woogie music of African-American jazz pianist Albert Ammons. Though released by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in 1941, Boogie- Doodle was actually made by McLaren in New York City in 1940, a year before he was invited by John Grierson to Canada to found the NFB's animation unit. McLaren, who had been influenced by the hand-painted films of Len Lye, was in New York exploring the technique on a grant from the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, creating Boogie-Doodle along with three other cameraless films: Dots, Loops and Stars and Stripes. The animation in Boogie-Doodle coincides exactly with Ammon's musical piece, with McLaren's animation beginning at the very first bar and concluding at the final note. ==References== ==External links== *Watch Boogie-Doodle at NFB.ca (requires Adobe Flash) *Boogie-Doodle at IMDB Category:1940 films Category:1940 animated films Category:Films without speech Category:Films directed by Norman McLaren Category:Visual music Category:Jazz films Category:Drawn-on-film animated films Category:National Film Board of Canada animated short films Category:Canadian animated short films Category:Canadian short films Category:Solomon R.
