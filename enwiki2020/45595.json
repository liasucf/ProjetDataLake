    "text": "was the 91st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1274 through 1287.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, pp. 262\u2013268; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014dki. pp. 233\u2013237. This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 9th-century Emperor Uda and go- (\u5f8c), translates literally as \"later\"; and thus, he is sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Uda,\" or in some older sources, may be identified as \"Emperor Uda, the second\" or as \"Emperor Uda II.\" ==Genealogy== Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina) was Yohito (\u4e16\u4ec1).Titsingh, p. 262; Varley, p. 233. He was the second son of Emperor Kameyama. They were from the Daikaku-ji line. *Consort: Imperial Princess Reishi (\u59c8\u5b50\u5185\u89aa\u738b; 1270\u20131307) later Y\u016bgimon'in (\u904a\u7fa9\u9580\u9662), Emperor Go-Fukakusa's daughter *Consort: Horikawa (Minamoto) Motoko (\u5800\u6cb3\uff08\u6e90\uff09\u57fa\u5b50) later Nishika'mon-in (\u897f\u83ef\u9580\u9662; 1269\u20131355), Horikawa Tomomori's daughter **First son: Imperial Prince Kuniharu (\u90a6\u6cbb\u89aa\u738b) later Emperor Go-Nij\u014d *Lady-in-waiting: Itsutsuji (Fujiwara) Chushi (\u4e94\u8fbb\uff08\u85e4\u539f\uff09\u5fe0\u5b50; 1268\u20131319) later Dantenmon'in (\u8ac7\u5929\u9580\u9662), Itsutsuji Tadatsugu's daughter **First daughter: Imperial Princess Sh\u014dshi (1286\u20131348) (\u5968\u5b50\u5185\u89aa\u738b) later Tatchimon-in (\u9054\u667a\u9580\u9662) **Second son: Imperial Prince Takaharu (\u5c0a\u6cbb\u89aa\u738b) later Emperor Go-Daigo **Third son: Imperial Prince Priest Sh\u014den (\u6027\u5186\u6cd5\u89aa\u738b; 1292\u20131347) **Fourth son: Imperial Prince Priest Shokaku (\u627f\u899a\u6cd5\u89aa\u738b; b. 1294) *Consort: Princess Mizuko (\u745e\u5b50\u5973\u738b) later Eikamon'in (\u6c38\u5609\u9580\u9662; 1272\u20131329), Prince Munetaka's daughter *Consort: Ichijo-no-Tsubone\uff08\u4e00\u6761\u5c40\uff09, Hashimoto Sanetoshi's daughter **Fifth Son: Imperial Prince Priest Shosi (\u6027\u52dd\u6cd5\u89aa\u738b; d. 1354) *Consort: Princess Rinshi (\u6384\u5b50\u5973\u738b), Prince Munetaka's daughter **Second daughter: Imperial Princess Baishi (\u7996\u5b50\u5185\u89aa\u738b) later S\u016bmeimon-in (\u5d07\u660e\u9580\u9662), married Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi *Consort: Itsutsuji Munechika's daughter **Third daughter: Imperial Princess T\u014dshi/Ch\u016bshi (\u6109\u5b50\u5185\u89aa\u738b) *Consort: Kazan'in Nagamasa\u2019s daughter **Princess *Consort: Shinsanmi-no-tsubone (\u65b0\u4e09\u4f4d\u5c40) ** Prince (b. 1307) ==Events of Go-Uda's life== Yohito-shinn\u014d became crown prince in 1268. According to the terms of the late emperor's will (Go-Saga died in 1272), in 1274, he would become emperor upon the death or abdication of Emperor Kameyama. * 6 March 1274 (Bun'ei 11, 26th day of the 1st month): In the 15th year of Kameyama-tenn\u014d 's reign (\u4e80\u5c71\u5929\u7687\u5341\u4e94\u5e74), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by his cousin.Titsingh, p. 261; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. * 4 May 1274 (Bun'ei 11, 26th day of the 3rd month): Emperor Go-Uda is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, p. 262; Varley, p. 44. The retired Emperor Kameyama continued to exercise power as cloistered emperor. During his reign, the unsuccessful Mongol invasions of Japan occurred, first in 1274 and again in 1281. Though they established a beachhead at Hakata, Kyushu, they were driven out within a short time. * 23 November 1275 (Kenji 1, 5th day of the 11th month): Hirohito-shinn\u014d was named Crown Prince and heir to his first cousin, the Daikakuji-t\u014d Emperor Go-Uda. This was the result of political maneuvering by Hirohito's father, the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d Emperor Go-Fukakusa.Titsingh, p. 262, 270. In 1287, retired Emperor Go-Fukakusa, dissatisfied with the fact that his own lineage (the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d) did not control the throne, while that of his younger brother, the retired Emperor Kameyama (the Daikakuji-t\u014d) did, persuaded both the Bakufu and the imperial court to compel the Emperor to abdicate in favor of Go-Fukakusa's son (Emperor Fushimi). After this time, the struggle between the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d and the Daikakuji-t\u014d over the imperial throne continued. After Go-Uda's abdication, his Daikakuji-t\u014d controlled the throne from 1301 to 1308 (Emperor Go-Nij\u014d) and again from 1318 until the era of northern and southern courts (begun 1332) when they became the southern court (ending in 1392). Go-Uda was cloistered emperor during the reign of his own son, Go-Nij\u014d, from 1301 until 1308, and again from 1318, when his second son Go-Daigo took the throne until 1321, when Go-Daigo began direct rule. Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Go-Uda. * 16 July 1324 (Genk\u014d 4, 25th day of the 6th month): Go-Uda died at age 58.Varley, p. 237. Emperor Go- Uda's Imperial mausoleum is the Rengebuji no misasagi (\u84ee\u83ef\u5cef\u5bfa\u9675) in Uky\u014d-ku, Kyoto.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 422. ==Kugy\u014d== Kugy\u014d (\u516c\u537f) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Go-Uda's reign, this apex of the Daij\u014d-kan included: * Sessh\u014d, Kuj\u014d Tadaie, 1274 * Sessh\u014d, Ichij\u014d Ietsune, 1274\u20131275 * Sessh\u014d, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1275\u20131278 * Kampaku, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1278\u20131287 * Kampaku, Nij\u014d Morotada, 1287\u20131289 * Sadaijin * Udaijin * Nadaijin * Dainagon ==Eras of Go-Uda's reign== The years of Go-Uda's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or neng\u014d.Titsingh, p. 262. * Bun'ei (1264\u20131275) * Kenji (1275\u20131278) * K\u014dan (1278\u20131288) ==Notes== Japanese Imperial kamon \u2014 a stylized chrysanthemum blossom ==See also== * Emperor of Japan * List of Emperors of Japan * Imperial cult ==References== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
