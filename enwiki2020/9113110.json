Guitarist/songwriter Toy Caldwell drew heavily from bluegrass and country while writing songs for the band's debut. The album's eclectic style has been categorized as country rock, progressive rock and Southern rock. The lead single, \"Can't You See\", musically is a mixture of country rock and Southern rock.
