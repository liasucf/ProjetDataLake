    "text": "The Interception () is a Russian game show which aired in 1997. The concept was for the contestant to \"steal\" (actually, be given the keys to) a car and avoid the police for 35 minutes. If the contestant successfully avoided the police, they won the car. The car chase was done in the real Moscow streets, and had to obey traffic laws. At its peak, the show had 60 million viewers per episode. The show was created with the cooperation of the Russian police, and the police chasing the \"thief\" were real officers. With the odds being tilted against the \"thieves\", the show had the aim of discouraging car thieves. The show failed to lower the sky-high car theft rates, and was therefore cancelled. ==References== Category:1997 Russian television series debuts Category:1997 Russian television series endings Category:1990s Russian television series Category:Television franchises Category:Russian game shows Category:Motor vehicle theft Category:Works about law enforcement Category:Crime in Russia ",
