    "text": "Ann Turner Cook (born November 20, 1926) is an American mystery novelist, who was the model for the familiar Gerber Baby artwork seen on baby food packages of the Gerber Products Company. ==Gerber baby== Cook is the daughter of a syndicated cartoonist Leslie Turner, who drew the comic strip Captain Easy for decades. Their neighbor was the artist Dorothy Hope Smith, who did a charcoal drawing of Ann when she was a baby. In 1928, when Gerber announced it was looking for baby images for its upcoming line of baby food, Smith's drawing was submitted and subsequently chosen. It was trademarked in 1931. The drawing of Ann Turner Cook has been used on virtually all Gerber baby food packaging since. Cook attended the University of South Florida and other post-secondary schools. She studied education and English journalism and earned several degrees, including a master's degree in English Education. She is a sister in the sorority Pi Beta Phi. Cook taught at Oak Hill elementary school in Florida, and then at Madison Junior High School, in Tampa, Florida. In 1966, she joined the English Department of Tampa's Hillsborough High School, where she taught literature and creative writing. Students there dedicated the 1978 Hilsborean school yearbook to Cook, who sponsored the book. In it, students described her as \"a teacher who really communicates with the students\" and who, \"without any complaints . . . has stayed late, worked nights, and with quiet efficiency supported her staff in their monumental task\".Hilsboroean 1972: Volume Fifty-six: p. 19 In 1990, Cook appeared as a guest on To Tell The Truth in a one on one segment. ==Novels== After retiring from teaching, Cook became a novelist. A member of the Mystery Writers of America, she is the author of the Brandy O'Bannon series of mystery novels set on Florida's Gulf Coast. The adventures of Florida reporter and amateur sleuth O'Bannon are detailed in Trace Their Shadows (2001) and Shadow over Cedar Key (2003). == References == ==External links== *USF 50th Anniversary\u2014College of Education Philanthropic Activities (with a photo of Ann Turner Cook) * http://annturnercook.info/ Category:1926 birthsuh9g55ggg8gg Category:21st- century American novelists Category: American mystery writers Category: Living people Category:American artists' models Category: Place of birth missing (living people) Category: American women novelists Category: University of South Florida alumni Category:Writers from Tampa, Florida Category: Women mystery writers Category:Schoolteachers from Florida ",
