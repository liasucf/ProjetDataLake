He often juxtaposed the fear stoked by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and the highly free syntax of Czech language. His poems are closely connected to the traditions and the nature of the region he lived in, Southern Moravia. His poems were mentioned in the book Ignorance written by Milan Kundera. Sk\u00e1cel was the editor of Host do domu, an important literary magazine between 1963 and 1969. He was awarded the German international literary Petrarca-Preis and Slovenian international Vilenica prize in 1989. When in 1996 she won the Georg-B\u00fcchner Prize for literature, the German poet Sarah Kirsch named Sk\u00e1cel as a major influence.
