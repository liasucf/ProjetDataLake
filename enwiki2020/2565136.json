    "text": "The Trump Organization is a group of about 500 business entities of which Donald Trump is the sole or principal owner. About 250 of these entities use the Trump name. The organization was founded in 1923 by Donald Trump's grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, and father, Fred Trump, as E. Trump & Son. Donald Trump began leading it in 1971, renamed it around 1973, and handed off its leadership to his children in 2017. The Trump Organization, through its various constituent companies and partnerships, has or has had interests in real estate development, investing, brokerage, sales and marketing, and property management. Trump Organization entities own, operate, invest in, and develop residential real estate, hotels, resorts, residential towers, and golf courses in various countries. They also operate or have operated in construction, hospitality, casinos, entertainment, book and magazine publishing, broadcast media, model management, retail, financial services, food and beverages, business education, online travel, commercial and private aviation and beauty pageants. Trump Organization entities also own the New York television production company that produced the reality television franchise The Apprentice. Retail operations include or have included fashion apparel, jewelry and accessories, books, home furnishings, lighting products, bath textiles and accessories, bedding, home fragrance products, small leather goods, vodka, wine, barware, steaks, chocolate bars, and bottled spring water. Since the financial statements of the Trump Organization's holdings and Donald Trump's personal tax returns are both private, its true value is not publicly known, though a wide range of estimates have been made. Trump has publicly released little definitive financial documentation to confirm his valuation claims. On several occasions, Trump has been accused of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through aggressive lobbying of the media (in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list) to bolster his perceived net worth. == History == === Founding and early history === An early logotype of the Trump Organization, as it appeared in 1976 correspondence from Donald Trump to the Penn Central Transportation Company The company's background starts with Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump, a German immigrant couple who moved to the borough of Queens in 1906. Frederick began developing real estate there. On May 30, 1918, he died of Spanish flu in the 1918 influenza pandemic, leaving an estate valued at $31,359 (or about $535,381 in 2020). Elizabeth carried on in the real estate business after her husband's death. She had contractors build houses on the empty lots Frederick had owned, sold the houses, and lived off the mortgage payments.Blair, pp. 119\u2013120}} Her vision was to have her three children continue the family business. Her middle child, Fred Trump, began construction of his first house in 1923, soon after graduating high school. Elizabeth partially financed Fred's houses, and held the business in her name because Fred had not reached the age of majority. They did business as \"E. Trump & Son\", building hundreds of houses in Queens over the next several years. E. Trump & Son went out of business during the Great Depression. In 1933, Fred Trump opened a supermarket, known as the Trump Market, but quickly sold it and returned to the real estate business. Around this same time, Fred Trump and a partner acquired the mortgage-servicing subsidiary of Brooklyn's J. Lehrenkrauss & Co., which had gone bankrupt and subsequently been broken up amid charges of fraud. This gave Trump access to the titles of many properties nearing foreclosure, which he bought at low cost and sold for a profit. Trump was quickly thrust into the limelight as one of New York City's most successful businessmen. In 1935, the company moved to Brooklyn, where, in addition to Queens, Trump was a prolific builder of single-family homes. During World WarII, Trump constructed apartments and temporary housing for military personnel in Virginia and Pennsylvania. In 1944, he shifted his focus back to Brooklyn and began planning to develop large apartment buildings. He opened the 1,344-unit Shore Haven complex in 1949, followed by Beach Haven in 1950 and Trump Village in 1964. Elizabeth remained involved in the family business throughout her life. Even in her 70s, she collected coins from the laundromats in the Trump buildings. === Leadership under Donald Trump === Donald Trump worked for his father's business while attending the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1968 officially joined the company. In the early 1970s, Fred became chairman of the board while Donald was made president of the company. Around 1973, he began referring to the business as the Trump Organization. The business had previously been referred to on occasion as the Fred C. Trump Organization, the Fred Trump Organization, or the Trump Organization, (Subscription required to read full article.) but had not had a single formal name. Donald Trump focused his efforts on major development projects in Manhattan, including the renovation of the Commodore Hotel, in partnership with Hyatt, as the Grand Hyatt New York (opened in 1980); the construction of Trump Tower in partnership with The Equitable (1983); and the development of Trump Plaza (1984). He also opened three casino hotels in Atlantic City, New Jersey: Trump Plaza (1984), Trump Castle (1985), and Trump Taj Mahal (1990). Amid a real estate slump in 1990, the Trump Organization approached a financial crisis and was believed to be on the brink of collapse, with Donald Trump and his companies owing 72 banks a total of $4 billion, of which Trump personally guaranteed $800 million. Trump hired Stephen Bollenbach as the company's first chief financial officer, while Allen Weisselberg continued to serve under him as controller. Trump spent the following years renegotiating his debts, and gave up some properties, including the Trump Shuttle airline and a stake in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Bollenbach left the company in 1992. In 1995, Trump took another major step towards financial stability, launching a publicly traded company for the Trump casinos, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts. By 1996, Trump was widely considered to be making a comeback. The casino company did not fare as well, however, and Trump eventually lost his stake in the company to bankruptcy. In 1997, Fred Trump transferred ownership of the bulk of his portfolio of apartment buildings to his four surviving children (Donald, Robert, Maryanne, and Elizabeth). Fred died in 1999. In 2004, the four siblings sold the apartments for $737.9 million to a group led by Rubie Schron, marking the family's exit from ownership of their father's business. === Trump presidency === Donald Trump relinquished his role in the Trump Organization after the 2016 election. On January 11, 2017, he announced that he and his daughter Ivanka would fully resign and his sons Donald Jr. and Eric would take executive charge of the various businesses, along with CFO Allen Weisselberg. Trump retained his financial stake in the business, despite having offered during the campaign to put all his assets in a \"blind trust\" should he win the presidency. His attorney at the time, Sheri Dillon, said Trump's assets would be overseen by an ethics officer, and that the Trump Organization would not pursue any new foreign business deals. Under the pre-inaugural management agreement, Forbes magazine reported in March 2017: > The Trump Organization has curtailed some of its international work, pulling > out of deals in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Brazil, while pledging to do no new > foreign deals (though it has apparently resurrected an old deal in the > Dominican Republic). Trump's international hotel licensing and management > business makes up only $220 million of his estimated $3.5 billion fortune, > but it's the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio\u2014and it throws off > chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some > international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic > agreements. Eric Trump, in the Forbes article, discussed the \"clear separation of church and state that we maintain\" between the business and his father and said that with his father's presidency and related changes \"[y]ou could look at it either way\" in terms of business prospects. He also said that \"he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency... 'probably quarterly... profitability reports and stuff like that'.\" The article quoted Larry Noble, general counsel of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center and a former chief ethics officer at the Federal Election Commission, and President George W. Bush's former chief ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, as looking negatively at such multiple planned updates of President Trump per year. Noble said in part \"if he is now going to get reports from his son about the businesses, then he really isn't separate in any real way.\" Painter said in part \"at the end of the day, he owns the business. He has the conflicts that come with it.\" Also in March 2017, Forbes did a listing of all \"36 mini- Trumps\", as it termed the domestic and international partners\u2014often described as \"billionaires\"\u2014with whom the Trump Organization has worked over the years. Introducing the listing, the magazine reported that at least 14 of the partners attended the president's inauguration and some of them paid for $18,000-a-night accommodations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., for the event. In April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Eric Trump stated that the Trump Organization had requested rental relief from the landlord for its Trump International Hotel, which is the General Services Administration of the federal government. == Real estate == Map highlights countries with properties that are either owned or licensed by the Trump Organization as of December 2016. As of 2019, Trump's net worth (as estimated by Forbes Magazine) is $3.1 billion, with about half of that coming from his New York City real estate holdings, and about a third coming from his national and international properties (including hotels and golf courses).

The Trump Organization and Rink Management Services won the concessions to operate both rinks in 2001.

The coat of arms granted to Davies in 1939 bears the motto \"Integritas\". Joseph E. Davies, third husband of Marjorie Merriweather Post and a former U.S. ambassador of Welsh origins, was granted a coat of arms by British heraldic authorities in 1939. After Donald Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the Trump Organization started using Davies's coat of arms at Trump golf courses and estates across the country. It was also registered with the U.S. patent and trademark office. In 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Scotland, but was warned by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the highest authority for Scottish heraldry, that an act of the Scottish Parliament from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms that had been granted to \"The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd\" by the Lord Lyon in 2011. The coat of arms granted to \"The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd\" in 2011 bears the battle cry: \"Nunquam Concedere\". Sarah Malone, executive vice-president of \"The Trump International Golf Links, Scotland\", said that \"the coat of arms brings together visual elements that signify different aspects of the Trump family heritage [...], the Lion Rampant [in the crest] makes reference to Scotland and the stars to America. Three chevronels are used to denote the sky, sand dunes and sea\u2014the essential components of the site, and the double-[headed] Eagle represents the dual nature and nationality of Trump's heritage (Scottish and German). The Eagle clutches golf balls making reference to the great name of golf, and the motto Numquam Concedere is Latin for Never Give Up\u2014Trump's philosophy.\" From 2014, Trump used the same logo for \"The Trump International Golf Links, Ireland\", the golf resort built from his acquisition of Doonbeg Golf Club. == Financing == During the property boom of the 1980s, Trump acquired numerous properties and by 1990 owed $4 billion to 72 banks. When the market entered a slump in 1990 that placed the Organization at risk of collapse, Trump and his lenders acted to restructure his debts, although they disagree on who identified the problem and initiated negotiations. The resulting restructuring required his banks to forgive some of Trump's debt. Trump's casinos later entered bankruptcies in which his bondholders took deep losses. After these incidents, Trump had difficulty borrowing new money from most mainstream financial institutions. Deutsche Bank, which did not have a significant presence on Wall Street during the 1980s, expanded rapidly in the United States during the 1990s, and by the end of the decade had become Trump's primary bank lender. In the process of its rapid expansion, the bank engaged in numerous questionable practices, including manipulating currencies and interest rates, laundering billions of dollars for Russian oligarchs and misleading international bank regulators. The bank was fined $630 million in 2017 for facilitating a $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme. The bank provided Trump with a variety of services including financial instruments designed to shield him from risks and outside scrutiny, and connected Trump to wealthy Russians who were interested in investing in Western real estate. During the 2000s and 2010s, Trump borrowed $2 billion from the bank, owing it about $360 million in 2016. Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., was quoted as saying at a 2008 New York real estate conference, \"In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets...We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\" James Dodson, a golf magazine writer, said that during a 2014 golf game, he asked Trump's son Eric how the Organization was funding its golf resort acquisitions, to which Trump responded, \"Well, we don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\" Eric Trump later denied making the statement. == Valuation disputes == The financial statements of the Trump Organization's holdings are private, as are Donald Trump's personal tax returns, and there exist a wide range of estimates of the Trump Organization's true value. Donald Trump has been accused on several occasions of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through the aggressive lobbying of the media, in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list, in order to bolster his perceived net worth among the public over several decades. He has released little definitive financial documentation to the public confirm his valuation claims. It is difficult to determine a net value for the Trump Organization's real estate holdings independently since each individual property may be encumbered by debt. In October 2015, Forbes published an article titled \"Inside The Epic Fantasy That's Driven Donald Trump For 33 Years\" detailing its struggle to estimate the true net worth of Trump and the Trump Organization. In 2018 a former Forbes journalist who had worked on the Forbes list claimed in an op-ed to The Washington Post that Trump had lied about his wealth to Forbes to get on the list repeatedly and suggested that Forbes' previous low-end estimates of Trump's net worth were still well above his true net worth. ==Government investigations== An October 2018 New York Times expos\u00e9 entitled \"Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father\" included detailed analysis of Trump family financial records, which Trump's niece Mary Trump revealed in July 2020 she had provided to the Times. The article described apparent tax fraud conducted by Trump and his siblings related to their joint inheritance of their father's company. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance announced on the day of publication that it would review the matter. Former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen testified to Congress in February 2019 that the Organization inflated the values of its assets in documents it submitted to banks and insurers. Following Cohen's testimony, the New York State Department of Financial Services issued a subpoena to Aon, the Organization's longtime insurance broker. In August 2020, the New York State Attorney General disclosed in a court filing that the Organization was under investigation for the asset inflation allegation, asking a court to compel the Organization to provide information it had been withholding; the filing also noted that Eric Trump had resisted a subpoena and abruptly canceled an interview scheduled for the previous month. The Manhattan District Attorney, which had been seeking Trump's tax returns, suggested in an August 2020 federal court filing that the Organization was under investigation for bank and insurance fraud. As of September 2019, the Organization was under federal investigation by the Southern District of New York regarding inflated insurance claims allegations. In July 2020, Trump Organization executive vice president Eric Trump canceled a scheduled deposition appearance under subpoena. On September 17, he stated he would provide the deposition after the November election, citing his busy travel schedule and \"to avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes.\" Days later, New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to provide the deposition by October 7. == Controversies == In 1973, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Civil Rights Division filed a civil rights suit against the Trump Organization charging them for violating the 1968 Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent to black people. The National Urban League had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the white testers got the apartments, whereas the black testers did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 Village Voice article quoted a rental agent who said Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a consent decree described by the head of DOJ's housing division as \"one of the most far- reaching ever negotiated\" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently stated that continuing \"racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.\"Barrett, Wayne; Campbell, Jon (July 20, 2015). \"How a young Donald Trump forced his way from Avenue Z to Manhattan\" . Village Voice. Retrieved September 11, 2015. Also, it is alleged that the Trump Organization has a history of not paying for services rendered. Several hundred contractors or workers for the organization have filed lawsuits or liens saying they were not paid for their work, and others say they had to settle for cents on the dollar.\"Hundreds Claim Donald Trump Doesn't Pay His Bills\" . NBC News. Retrieved September 30, 2016. In 1989, New York State officials ordered the Grand Hyatt New York, a hotel owned at the time by the Trump Organization and the Hyatt Corporation, to pay New York City $2.9 million in rent that had been withheld by the hotel in 1986 due to \"unusual\" accounting changes approved by Donald Trump. An investigation by New York City auditors noted that the hotel was missing basic financial records and found the hotel was using procedures that violated generally accepted accounting principles. From 2000 on, the Trump Organization held 50% of TD Trump Deutschland AG, a corporate venture with a German company, planning to build a skyscraper named \"Trump Tower Europe\" in Frankfurt, Berlin or Stuttgart, but allegedly never paid the full amount of their \u20ac2 million share. At least three lawsuits followed and the company was disestablished in 2005. Erdo\u011fan attended the opening of the Trump Towers Istanbul AVM in 2012. , Tom Scharfeld owns the trademark of \"iTrump\" mobile app which plays the trumpet. As \"the word trump has other meanings\", the Court did not rule in favour of the Trump Organization. In August 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney was reported to be considering criminal charges against the organization and two of its senior executives regarding the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels. In October 2018, The New York Times published an expos\u00e9 arguing that the Trump family evaded over $500 million in gift taxes and estate taxes on the transfer of Fred Trump's wealth to his children. The alleged schemes involved siphoning money from Fred's companies to his children throughout their lives, and understating the value of transferred properties. The Trump family denied the allegations. New York tax authorities opened an investigation into the matter. In September 2020, it was revealed that Trump's properties had charged the government over $1.1 million since the beginning of his presidency. At the Bedminster club, for example, the Secret Service rented a three-bedroom cottage for $17,000 per month. The Washington Post arrived at this total amount after it filed a public-records lawsuit and pieced together receipts and invoices from Trump\u2019s businesses. == See also == * Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2019) == References == Footnotes Citations == Further reading == * Frank, Thomas (January 12, 2018). \"Secret Money: How Trump Made Millions Selling Condos to Unknown Buyers\".
