Its accreditation records circa 2004 described it as an independent Catholic institution. Prior to 2001 the average enrollment was about 500. On March 25, 2001, Ukrainian Mykhaylo Kofel murdered nun-in-training Michelle Lewis; authorities discovered her body in the convent house on campus. Kofel pleaded guilty in 2005 and was scheduled to have a thirty-year sentence. Prosecutors initially sought the death penalty but no longer pursued it after Kofel made allegations of sexual abuse. The scandal caused multiple parents to send children to other schools, and the average post-murder enrollment was 340. Circa 2004 there were 37 people in the school's faculty. The school closed in 2004, and the charter school Archimedean Academy acquired the campus. ==Operations== Circa 2004 the yearly tuition was $6,525. ==Academic performance== Luisa Yanez of the Miami Herald wrote that Holy Cross \"enjoyed a stellar academic reputation.\" ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Schools in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Catholic secondary schools in Florida Category:1985 establishments in Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 1985 Category:2004 disestablishments in Florida Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2004 Category:Private K-12 schools in Florida ",
