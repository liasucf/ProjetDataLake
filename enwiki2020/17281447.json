    "text": "The Governor of Punjab is the appointed head of state of the provincial government in Punjab, Pakistan. Although the Governor is the head of the province on paper, it is largely a ceremonial position; and the main powers lie with the Chief Minister Punjab and Chief Secretary Punjab. However, throughout the history of Pakistan, the powers of the provincial governors were vastly increased, when the provincial assemblies were dissolved and the administrative role came under direct control of the governors, as in the cases of martial laws of 1958\u20131972 and 1977\u20131985, and governor rules of 1999\u20132002. In the case of Punjab, there was direct governor rule in 1949\u20131951, when the provincial chief minister of that time was removed and assemblies dissolved. == List of governors == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; text- align:center\" |- ! \u2116 ! style=\"width:23%;\"|Name !
