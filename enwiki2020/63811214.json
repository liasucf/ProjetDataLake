    "text": "Henriette Henriot (born Marie Henriette Alphonsine Grossin 14 November 1857 \u2013 17 March 1944) was an actress and a favourite model of the French artist Renoir. She is known for the model in his painting La Parisienne on display at the National Museum, Cardiff. Henriot, the daughter of Aline Grossin, a milliner, started at the Conservatoire de musique et de d\u00e9clamation in Paris in 1872, where she studied acting. She was still using her birth name of Marie Henriette Alphonsine Grossin, and it wasn't until 1874 when she started to use her stage names of Henriette Henriot, Mademoiselle Henriot, and Madame Henriot when she was appearing in acting roles at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ambigu-Comique and had started modelling for Renoir as a way to earn extra cash. It was at this point that she was performing in minor parts in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ambigu-Comique. Colin Bailey formerly of the Frick Collection said in and an exhibition catalogue in 2012: Renoir, Impressionism, and Full-Length Painting: > Between 1874 and 1876 Henriot modelled for five of Renoir's most ambitious > full-length pictures and at least seven smaller works. She appears fully and > fashionably dressed in La Parisienne , draped and damp in La Source; seated > in the shade with a suitor in the Lovers; in Troubadour costume in The Page, > and as the protective elder sister in La Promenade. It is not known whether Renoir ever paid Henriot for modelling, however he did give her two paintings, the last painting her did of her and A Vase of Flowers. Renoir had also become close friends with her during this time, so much so that he also painted her daughter, Jeanne Ang\u00e8le Grossin (1878 \u2013 1900) who modelled for him in Fillette au chapeau bleu (Little girl in blue hat). Jeanne was later killed in a theater fire in 1900, when she was 21. ==Stage career== The following is a selection of plays that Henriot acted in: *1875 Le Fils du Diable by Paul F\u00e9val *1975 La V\u00e9nus by Gordes d\u2019Adolphe Belot *1975 Le Fils de Chopart by Jules Dornay *1877 P\u00e9pite *1882 Une aventure de Garrick by Fabrice Labrousse *1883 La Famille d'Armelles by Jean Marras *1883 Sganarelle by Moli\u00e8re *1894 La Belle Limonadi\u00e8re by Paul Mahalin *1895 L'Argent by \u00c9mile Fabre directed by Andr\u00e9 Antoine *1898 Mon enfant by Ambroise Janvier *1902 Nini l'assommeur by Maurice Bernhardt *1904 Le Bercail by Henri Bernstein *1905 La Rafale (Whirlwind) by Henri Bernstein *1908 Le Petit Fouchard by Charles Raymond *1908 Le Passe-partout by Georges Thurner *1909 Pierre et Th\u00e9r\u00e8se by Marcel Pr\u00e9vost *1912 La Crise by Paul Bourget *1912 Le Myst\u00e8re de la chambre jaune by Gaston Leroux *1914 Monsieur Brotonneau by Robert de Flers ==Modelling career== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Selection of portraits by Pierre- Auguste Renoir File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 089.jpg|La Parisienne also known as La Dame en Bleu English: The Blue Lady (1874) File:Auguste Renoir - Lovers - Google Art Project.jpg|Lovers (1875) File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - The Source (La Source) - BF908 - Barnes Foundation.jpg|La Source (1875) File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - La Promenade - Google Art Project.jpg|Mother and Children also known as La Promenade (1876) File:Renoir - Mademoiselle Henriot ou jeune fille au ruban bleu, 1876.jpg|Mademoiselle Henriot ou jeune fille au ruban bleu English: Miss Henriot or young girl with blue ribbon (1876) File:Renoir - Portrait of Henriette Henriot c. 1876.jpg|Portrait of Henriette Henriot (1876) File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Madame Henriot en travesti.jpg|Madame Henriot 'en travesti' (the Page) (1877) File:Renoir - CLAUDE MONET ET MME HENRIOT, 1880.jpg|Claude Monet Et Mme Henriot English: Claude Monet and Madame Henriot (1880) File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Jeanne Henriot.jpg|Henriot's daughter (Jeanne Ang\u00e8le Grossin) Fillette au chapeau bleu English: Little girl in blue hat (1881) |} ==See also== * Impressionism * Theatre of France == References == ==External links== * Category:1857 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Actresses from Paris Category:French female models Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Burials at Passy Cemetery ",
