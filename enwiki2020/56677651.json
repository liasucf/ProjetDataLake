The castle was, however, besieged by the troops of the Dukes of Bourbon and Burgundy. The Duke of Bourbon (Louis II, Duke of Bourbon) was her son, and John Frossart tells us that the siege redoubt he organized was \"as strong and as well fortified as a good town might have been\".Jean Froissart, Chronicles of England, France, Spain, and the Adjoining Countries: From the Latter Part of the Reign of Edward II. to the Coronation of Henry IV.
