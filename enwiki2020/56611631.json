    "text": "Microtis alba, commonly known as the white mignonette orchid or slender onion- orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small, green and white flowers with a strong musky fragrance. It is much more common after a fire the previous summer than in unburned country. == Description == Microtis alba is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and sixty green and white flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers have a strong musky fragrance, lean downwards and are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are long, about wide and often curved. The labellum is oblong to wedge-shaped, long, wide with wrinkled edges and a notched tip. Flowering occurs from October to January but much more prolifically after fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis alba was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (alba) is a Latin word meaning \"white\". ==Distribution and habitat== The white mignonette orchid grows in a range of habitats from seasonally wet flats to forest and occurs between Dongara and Israelite Bay. ==Conservation== Microtis alba is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae alba Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1810 ",
