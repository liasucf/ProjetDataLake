He was a Colonel in the New Zealand Army, in the Volunteer and Territorial services and in charge of the Wellington Military District and Adjutant-General in World War I, No 82004. He has two files available online from Archives New Zealand. He found it difficult to explain the meaning of his \"traditional\" army rank. He received the CBE in 1918, and the CMG in 1923. Tate was educated at Timaru Boys' High School and after studying law was admitted to the bar in 1886, and started a practice in Greytown. He was appointed Stipendary Magistrate in Whangarei after his return from Samoa, then to New Plymouth. He died aged 74y in Greytown Hospital where he retired to in 1933, resuming his former legal partnership with Mr J. F. Thomson. He was survived by his second wife, two sons and two daughters. == References == * * * * Category:1864 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People educated at Timaru Boys' High School Category:New Zealand judges Category:19th-century New Zealand lawyers Category:19th-century New Zealand judges Category:20th-century New Zealand lawyers Category:20th-century New Zealand judges Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War I Category:New Zealand Army officers Category:New Zealand Freemasons Category:1910s in Samoa Category:1920s in Western Samoa Trust Territory Category:Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ",
