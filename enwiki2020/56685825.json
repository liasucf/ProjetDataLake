Let \\Chi^i be the sigma points. Then sigma-copies of the dynamical system are given by, \\dot\\Chi^i = f(\\Chi^i, u, t) Applying standard deterministic optimal control principles to this ensemble generates an unscented optimal controlNaoya Ozaki and Ryu Funase. \"Tube Stochastic Differential Dynamic Programming for Robust Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization Problems\", 2018 AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, AIAA SciTech Forum, (AIAA 2018-0861) https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2018-0861 == Applications == Unscented optimal control theory has been applied to UAV guidance, spacecraft attitude control and low-thrust trajectory optimization == References == Category:Optimal control ",
