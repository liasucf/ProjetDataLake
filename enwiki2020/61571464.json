    "text": "May the Lord Watch is the fifth studio album by American hip-hop duo Little Brother. It was released on August 20, 2019 by Imagine Nation Music, For Members Only Records and Empire Distribution. The album is the duo's first album since 2010's Leftback release. ==Background== The album's development secretly began during the previous year of 2018, after Rapper Big Pooh, Phonte and 9th Wonder reunited during September's Art of Cool festival. However, this wasn't made public until shortly after Big Pooh and Phonte announced the group's reunion as a duo in May 2019. Like the previous album Leftback, there was no production input from 9th, who went onward from the group to embark on a solo career as a producer and CEO. Instead, the album was primarily produced by longtime collaborators and Soul Council members Nottz, and Khrysis. Producers Black Milk, Focus..., Devin Morrison, Blaaq Gold, and even Phonte himself also contributed to the album's production.https://www.stereogum.com/2055382/stream-little-brothers-first- album-in-9-years-may-the-lord-watch/music/album-stream/ Sharing continuity with The Minstrel Show, the album's theme continues the running concept of a fictional television network called \"UBN\", which is a satire of stereotypical programs, advertisements, and pop-culture for African- Americans.https://www.okayplayer.com/music/little-brother-may-the-lord-watch- review.html One notable moment on the album was a skit from Peter Rosenberg announcing the death of Phonte's alter-ego Percy Miracles, which served as a tribute to the fact that the death of Phife Dawg was the event that brought Phonte and Pooh back together. The character previously appeared on The Minstrel Show album track \"Cheatin'\". In multiple interviews and podcasts - including the Premium Pete Show - it was revealed that 9th Wonder was originally supposed to be a part of the reunion album, under its original title Homecoming. The title was changed due to Beyonce releasing Homecoming: The Live Album to coincide with her concert film Homecoming. Phonte and Pooh decided to continue the project without 9th after several disagreements over beats and production on the album. ==Critical reception== May the Lord Watch was met with universal acclaim reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 86, based on 5 reviews. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from istandard producers ===Samples=== * \"The Feel\" contains a sample of \"A Man Alone\", as performed by Alan Hawkshaw * \"Everything\" contains a sample of \"In My Life\", as performed by Mahavishnu Orchestra * \"Black Magic (Make It Better)\" contains a sample of \"The Chase\", as performed by Anderson .Paak * \"Goodmorning Sunshine\" contains a sample of \"Eternal Love\", as performed by Utopia * \"Sittin' Alone\" contains a sample of \"Open Your Eyes\", as performed by Bobby Caldwell ==Personnel== * Phonte - writer, performer, recording engineer, mixing, addiditonal background vocals, executive producer * Rapper Big Pooh - writer, performer, executive producer * Peter Rosenberg - voice * Questlove - voice * Jemele Hill - voice * Laiya St. Clair - voice * Joe Scudda - voice * Evan Pollock - voice * Dyana Williams - voice * Jermaine White - voice * Devon Moore - voice * Ryan Davis - voice * Austin Hall - voice * Cesar Comanche - voice * BlakkSoul - writer, background vocals *Darien Brockington - background vocals * Carlitta Durand - background vocals * Shana Tucker - background vocals * Madison McFerrin - background vocals * Kristi Ae - background vocals * Tamisha Waden - background vocals * Be My Fiasco - background vocals * Carmen Rodgers - background vocals * Lorenzo \"Zo!\" Ferguson - keys, additional keys, additional synths * Sheldon Williams - keys and synths * Nottz - drums, bass * Nicolay - keys * Howard \"Soul\" Joyner - keys * Chris Boerner - recording, mixing, mastering * Antoine Lyers - photography * Tobias Rose - graphic layout, design * Deborah Mannis- Gardner (DMG Clearances, Inc) - sample clearance ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
