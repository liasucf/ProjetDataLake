    "text": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PPARGC1A gene. PPARGC1A is also known as human accelerated region 20 (HAR20). It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes. PGC-1\u03b1 is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1\u03b1 is also the primary regulator of liver gluconeogenesis, inducing increased gene expression for gluconeogeneis. == Function == PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism. It is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. This protein interacts with the nuclear receptor PPAR-\u03b3, which permits the interaction of this protein with multiple transcription factors. This protein can interact with, and regulate the activities of, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs) . It provides a direct link between external physiological stimuli and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and is a major factor causing slow- twitch rather than fast-twitch muscle fiber types. Endurance exercise has been shown to activate the PGC-1\u03b1 gene in human skeletal muscle. Exercise-induced PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle increases autophagy and unfolded protein response. PGC-1\u03b1 protein may be also involved in controlling blood pressure, regulating cellular cholesterol homoeostasis, and the development of obesity. == Regulation == PGC-1\u03b1 is thought to be a master integrator of external signals. It is known to be activated by a host of factors, including: # Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), both formed endogenously in the cell as by-products of metabolism but upregulated during times of cellular stress. # It is strongly induced by cold exposure, linking this environmental stimulus to adaptive thermogenesis. # It is induced by endurance exercise and recent research has shown that PGC-1\u03b1 determines lactate metabolism, thus preventing high lactate levels in endurance athletes and making lactate as an energy source more efficient. # cAMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, activated by an increase in cAMP following external cellular signals. # Protein kinase B / Akt is thought to downregulate PGC-1\u03b1, but upregulate its downstream effectors, NRF1 and NRF2. Akt itself is activated by PIP3, often upregulated by PI3K after G-protein signals. The Akt family is also known to activate pro-survival signals as well as metabolic activation. # SIRT1 binds and activates PGC-1\u03b1 through deacetylation inducing gluconeogenesis without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1\u03b1 has been shown to exert positive feedback circuits on some of its upstream regulators: # PGC-1\u03b1 increases Akt (PKB) and Phospho-Akt (Ser 473 and Thr 308) levels in muscle. # PGC-1\u03b1 leads to calcineurin activation. Akt and calcineurin are both activators of NF kappa B (p65). Through their activation PGC-1\u03b1 seems to activate NF kappa B. Increased activity of NF kappa B in muscle has recently been demonstrated following induction of PGC-1\u03b1. The finding seems to be controversial. Other groups found that PGC-1s inhibit NF kappa B activity. The effect was demonstrated for PGC-1 alpha and beta. PGC-1\u03b1 has also been shown to drive NAD biosynthesis to play a large role in renal protection in Acute Kidney Injury. == Clinical significance == Recently PPARGC1A has been implicated as a potential therapy for Parkinson's disease conferring protective effects on mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, brain-specific isoforms of PGC-1alpha have recently been identified which are likely to play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Massage therapy appears to increase the amount of PGC-1\u03b1 which leads to the production of new mitochondria. PGC-1\u03b1 and beta has furthermore been implicated in polarization to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages by interaction with PPAR\u03b3 with upstream activation of STAT6. An independent study confirmed the effect of PGC-1 on polarisation of macrophages towards M2 via STAT6/PPAR gamma and furthermore demonstrated that PGC-1 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production. PGC-1\u03b1 has been recently proposed to be responsible for \u03b2-aminoisobutyric acid secretion by exercising muscles. The effect of \u03b2-aminoisobutyric acid in white fat includes the activation of thermogenic genes that prompt the browning of white adipose tissue and the consequent increase of background metabolism. Hence, the \u03b2-aminoisobutyric acid could act as a messenger molecule of PGC-1\u03b1 and explain the effects of PGC-1\u03b1 increase in other tissues such as white fat. == Interactions == PPARGC1A has been shown to interact with: * CREB-binding protein * Farnesoid X receptor * FBXW7 * MED1 MED12 MED14 MED17 * NRF1 * Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1), Estrogen-related receptor beta (ERR\u03b2), Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR\u03b3). * Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma * Retinoid X receptor alpha. * Thyroid hormone receptor beta ERRalpha and PGC-1\u03b1 are coactivators of both Glucokinase (GK) and SIRT3, binding to an ERRE elements in the GK and SIRT3 promoters. ==See also== * PPARGC1B * Transcription coregulator ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * * * * Category:Gene expression Category:Transcription coregulators ",
