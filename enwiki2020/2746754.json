    "text": "All schools in Zambia whether public or private or community based are registered with the Ministry of General Education (MOGE). The Mandate of the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) is to formulate and implement Education and Science Policies, set and enforce standards and regulations, licence, supervise and provide education and skills development, as well as promote science, technology and innovation education. Primary schools in Zambia cover Grades 1 to 7 and secondary schools cover grades 8 to 12. Some schools, especially the private ones comprise both primary and secondary. Some private primary schools also have nursery, reception and pre-school grades before Grade 1. ==Primary schools== # Redland School,Lilayi https://www.facebook.com/redlandlusaka/?modal=admin_todo_tour # Acacia International School, Livingstone # Baluba Primary School # Barlastone Park School # Boyole Primary School # Buntungwa Primary School # Burma Road Primary School # Buteko Primary School # Butondo Primary School # Buyantanshi Primary School of Mufulira # Bwafwano Community School # B~Wise School Lusaka # Chaaba Community School of Livingstone # Chainda Primary School - Lusaka # Chaisa Primary School # Chakunkula Basic School # Chambavalley Basic School # Chawama Basic School # Chelstone Basic School # Chibelo Primary School # Chibolele Basic School # Chibolya Basic School # Chifwani Basic School of Kasama # Chilanga Middle Basic School of Chilanga # Chilenje B Primary School Chilenje B School # Chililabombwe Basic School of Chililabombwe # Chiwala Primary School of Maisiti # Chizera Primary School # Christ the King Basic School, Livingstone # Chunga Primary School, Lusaka # Crownhill School, Chipata # Dambwa Basic School, Livingstone # Eastlea Primary School # Fisansa Primary School # Foundation Steps Canadian International School, Ndola # Hakwaambwa Primary School, Monze # International School of Lusaka # Itawa Primary School # Ituna Basic School of Kasama # Jacaranda Primary School (Kabwe) # Jack CECUP School # Kabale Basic School of Mpika # Kabisapi Primary School # Kabulonga Primary School # Kabwata Primary School of Masaiti # Kabwe Primary School of Choma # Kafubu Block Primary School # Kafubu Primary School # Kakombe Primary School # Kakoso Basic School of Chililabombwe # Kalamba Primary School of Kawambwa # Kalanga Primary School # KAM Kindergarten and Primary School # Kamfukeshi Primary School of Kawambwa # Kamisenga Primary School # Kamitonte Primary School # Kamuchanga Primary School # Kang'wena Primary School # Kani Primary School of Kawambwa # Kanini Basic School of Ndola # Kankoyo Primary School # Kansenshi Basic School of Ndola # Kansumbi Primary School # Kansuswa Primary School of Mufulra # Kansuswa Primary School # Kapumfi Basic School # Kapweliyomba Basic School # Kasangazi Basic School # Kasapa Primary School # Kasoma Bangweulu Primary School # Kasompe Primary School # Kasongo Primary School of Luanshya # Kasumba Primary School # Kaswanga Primary School # Katondo Primary School,Kabwe # Kaumuzya Primary School, Monze # Kaunda Square Basic School # Kawama Primary School of Luanshya # Kawambwa Primary School # Kawambwa Primary School of Kawambwa # Kazungula Riverview Basic School # Kibombomene Primary School # Kichikwe Primary School # Kifubwa Primary School # Kikombe Primary School # Kingovwa Primary School # Kitwe Primary School # Konkola Basic School of Chililabombwe # Kyafukuma Primary School # Kyamwina Primary School # Lake Road P.T.A.
