    "text": "The 1913 Campeonato Carioca, the eighth edition of that championship, kicked off on May 3, 1913 and ended on December 7, 1913. It was organized by LMSA (Liga Metropolitana de Sports Athleticos, or Metropolitan Athletic Sports League). Ten teams participated. Am\u00e9rica won the title for the 1st time. Americano, Bangu and Mangueira were relegated. ==Participating teams== In February 1913, AFRJ and LMSA reconciled, with the former being absorbed into the latter. Originally, the championship would have 13 clubs: all the LMSA teams that had disputed the previous year's championship, and the five best teams in AFRJ's championship. However, in March, the clubs voted for reducing the championship to ten teams, and Cattete, Paulistano and Germ\u00e2nia found themselves relegated to the Second Level; As a protest, Germ\u00e2nia retired from the league altogether. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
