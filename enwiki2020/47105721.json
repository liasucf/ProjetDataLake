Meanwhile, in the bodies of the dead, w\u1e2bdw instead manifested as decomposition. The similarity of this conception of disease and decay to the Ancient Greek concept of peritt\u014dma has suggested that this element of Ancient Greek medicine may be traceable to Egypt. In searching for a convenient and concise translation of w\u1e2bdw into English, Steuer and Bertrand de Cusance Morant Saunders examine several possibilities: residues, a translation used by Jones for peritt\u014dma, fails to suggest the pathogenic nature of w\u1e2bdw; miasma, suggested by Jonckheere, misleadingly suggests transmission by air and an external origin; putrefaction or corruption, their own suggestion, is not entirely satisfactory to them, as w\u1e2bdw encompasses a conception greater than just the biological process of decay. The term w\u1e2bdw is attested in the Ebers Papyrus, Hearst papyrus, and Papyrus Berlin 3038, among other sources. == References == Category:Ancient Egypt Category:Ancient Egyptian medicine ",
