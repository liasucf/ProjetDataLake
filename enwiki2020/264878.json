    "text": "Southern Tagalog (), designated as Region IV, was an administrative region in the Philippines that comprised the current regions of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, plus Aurora of Central Luzon, and several cities of Metro Manila. It was partitioned into the two regions on May 17, 2002. == History == Southern Tagalog was the largest region in the Philippines in terms of both land area and population. The 2000 Census of Population and Housing showed the region having a total of 11,793,655 people, which comprised 15.42 percent of the 76.5 million population of the country at that time. Quezon City was the designated regional center of Southern Tagalog. The former region covered the area where many reside; the two other majority-Tagalophone regions are the National Capital Region and Central Luzon. === Partitioning === Region IV or Southern Tagalog was divided into Calabarzon and Mimaropa, upon the issuance of Executive Order No. 103, dated May 17, 2002, by then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Additionally, the province of Aurora was moved to Region III (Central Luzon). == Administrative divisions == === Provinces === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%;background- color:white;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Province ! scope=\"col\" | Provincial capital ! scope=\"col\" | Current region |- ! scope=\"row\" | Aurora | Baler | Central Luzon |- ! scope=\"row\" | Batangas | Batangas City | rowspan=\"3\" | Calabarzon |- ! scope=\"row\" | Cavite | Imus / Trece Martires |- ! scope=\"row\" | Laguna | Santa Cruz |- ! scope=\"row\" | Marinduque | Boac | rowspan=\"4\" | Mimaropa |- ! scope=\"row\" | Occidental Mindoro | Mamburao |- ! scope=\"row\" | Oriental Mindoro | Calapan |- ! scope=\"row\" | Palawan | Puerto Princesa |- ! scope=\"row\" | Quezon | Lucena | rowspan=\"2\" | Calabarzon |- ! scope=\"row\" | Rizal | Pasig / Antipolo |- ! scope=\"row\" | Romblon | Romblon | Mimaropa |} === Cities === Southern Tagalog region had 14chartered cities prior to its partition. * Antipolo * Bacoor * Batangas City * Calapan * Calamba * Cavite City * Lipa * Lucena * Puerto Princesa * San Pablo * Tagaytay * Tanauan * Trece Martires * Calapan City == Notes == == References == Category:Defunct regions of the Philippines Category:Tagalog Category:1965 establishments in the Philippines Category:2002 disestablishments in the Philippines Category:Calabarzon Category:Mimaropa ",
