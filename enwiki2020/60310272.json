They take their name from their first editor, Jacques Sirmond. Some of the laws appeared in abbreviated form in the Theodosian Code. The full collection survives only in a single early medieval manuscript now in Berlin, termed the Codex Lugdunensis. The Constitution's authenticity is disputed. Some historians, such as Elisabeth Magnou-Nortier, think they are church forgeries; others, such as Olivier Huck, find them genuine. Recent work has tended to suggest that they are essentially genuine but may have been edited, perhaps as part of preparations for the Second Council of M\u00e2con in 582. == Editions == The standard edition is Theodosiani libri XVI cum Constitutionibus Sirmondianis et Leges Novellae ad Theodosianum pertinentes, edited by T.
