The organization was founded in 1993 and has been subjected to multiple public complaints of harassment and aggression. Because of this, its members have been informally labeled \"Communist thugs in Taiwan\". Previous attacks by members of the PAA have targeted Falun Gong-practitioners in front of the Taipei 101 square in 2010. Zhang Xiuye () is a founding member of the Chinese Patriotic Alliance Association. She was born in Shanghai, married a Taiwanese and then moved to Taiwan around 1993, after which she and her husband divorced. According to some sources, Zhang is considered the leader of the PAA. She has been sued in Taiwan for aggravated slander. Another member of the PAA is the Vietnamese-born Su An-sheng (), who had reportedly kicked the former President of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, in the back. == References == == External links == *Taiwan: Spies, Lies and Cross-straits Ties.
