    "text": "Structure of the Armed Forces of Malta The Armed Forces of Malta () is the name given to the combined armed services of Malta. The AFM is a brigade sized organisation consisting of a headquarters and three separate battalions, with minimal air and naval forces. Since Malta is the guardian of the European Union's most southerly border, the AFM has an active role in border control.List of national services responsible for border control == History == In April 1800, while the blockade of Valletta was underway, Thomas Graham raised the first official Maltese Troops in the British Army, which became known as the Maltese Light Infantry. This battalion was disbanded in 1802 and succeeded by the Maltese Provincial Battalions, the Malta Coast Artillery and the Maltese Veterans. In 1815, Lieutenant Colonel Count Francis Rivarola was entrusted with the task of raising the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment following the disbandment of the Provincials, Veterans and Coast Artillery. The Royal Malta Fencible Regiment was converted to an artillery regiment in 1861 and became known as the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. Twenty-eight years later, the direct predecessors of the modern Armed Forces of Malta came into existence following the formation of the Royal Malta Artillery on 23 March 1889. The King's Own Malta Regiment was a territorial infantry regiment on the British Army colonial list. It was formed in 1801 as the \"Regiment of Maltese Militia\", existing only until the following year. It was reformed as the \"Maltese Militia\" by Sir Adrian Dingli in 1852 before being disbanded again in 1857. It was raised again, this time as the \"Royal Malta Regiment of Militia\" in 1889; this regiment was considered to be the successor to the \"Maltese Chasseurs\" of the early 19th century. The regiment was renamed the \"King's Own Royal Malta Regiment of Militia\" in 1903 and was disbanded in 1921. The regiment was raised for a fourth time in 1931 as the \"King's Own Malta Regiment\". Initially on the British Establishment, in 1951 it was transferred to the Malta Territorial Force before becoming part of the Malta Land Force on Malta's independence in 1970. The regiment was disbanded in 1972. The AFM was formed upon Malta becoming a republic in 1974, when 1 Regiment Royal Malta Artillery was renamed as 1 Regiment, AFM. This initially continued the artillery role, with 2 Regiment formed as an engineers unit. In 1980, 1 Regiment became a mixed unit, with infantry, aircraft and maritime responsibilities, the artillery element being transferred to 2 Regiment. In 1992, there was a major re-organisation, which led to the formation of 3 Regiment and the current structure.

IMM personnel resources in Malta totalled 12 officers and 35 NCOs from the three service branches of the Italian Armed Forces. It was also equipped with two AB 212 helicopters, 15 heavy plant vehicles, 60 light all- purpose utility vehicles, radio telecommunications, and weapons. == Personnel == The Armed Forces of Malta mainly consist of professional soldiers. There are also a small number of reserve soldiers. Malta does not employ conscription. Volunteers, who want to enlist, need to be citizens of Malta, and between 18\u201330 years old. In 2017, there were roughly 1,950 active personnel and 180 reservists. == Operations == Since Malta's entry in the European Union, the AFM has become more engaged in Peace keeping missions. The AFM has participated in 7 overseas operations. * **UNIFIL, 2007, 2018\u2013present (Lebanon) * **EUMM Georgia, since 2008 (Georgia) **EUNAVFOR Atalanta, since 2008 (Gulf of Aden) **EUBAM Rafah, since 2009 (Gaza\u2013Egypt border) **EUTM Somalia, since 2010 (Somalia) **EUFOR Libya, 2011 (Libya) **EUNAVFOR Med, since 2015 (Mediterranean Sea) **Frontex Joint Operation (JO) NAUTILUS, 2006 (Mediterranean Sea) **Frontex Joint Operation (JO) POSEIDON, since 2007 (Greece) **Frontex Joint Operation (JO), 2013 (Bulgaria) **Frontex Situation Centre, 2018 (Poland) * **Maritime Control Operation and Maritime Safety Training with Turkish Armed Forces, July 2020 == Equipment == On land, 1 Regiment is the designated home of the Maltese Infantry with C (Special Duties) Company being at the cutting edge of this unit. The company is being trained and equipped to be able to contribute a platoon for overseas humanitarian and rescue missions attached to an Italian regiment on missions mandated by the UN or the OSCE. Malta has to ensure that the troops are adequately trained and equipped up to Italian army standards for seamless integration within an Italian regiment, able to tackle any foreseeable problems for up to a year. C (Special Duties) Company is also being geared for a quick reaction role, ready for action at a moment's notice should an emergency, such as terrorism, arise. The kit used by the Maltese foot soldier has changed drastically in recent years. The fiat for change was given to C Company prior to its successful participation in the multi-national Partnership for Peace exercise in 1996. Following Malta's pledge towards the EU's Military Headline Goal in 2000, procurement received another boost. With funding being a perennial problem, over the years the Force had to rely on varied equipment transferred or financed by several countries. Standardisation was a headache. But matters have improved considerably, especially with regard to light infantry weapons. At one time there were as many as eight different types of pistol and associated ammunition, now there are two, principally the Beretta FS and some Makarov. The army has also bought Heckler and Koch sub- machine guns and, thanks to Chinese assistance, all infantrymen now have their own individual AKM rifle. The Maltese Infantry soldier is equipped with the latest British Army issue Personal Load Bearing Equipment including both the webbing and bergen as well as the woodland pattern battle dress uniform, Avon S10 respirator and Kevlar ballistic helmet. Protective ballistic vests and night vision goggles are carried when required. Infantry soldiers have a number of weapons at their disposal including the Kalashnikov AK-47 and AKM rifles, the Heckler and Koch MP 5 sub-machine guns, the Beretta 92 FS pistols, the PKM machine gun, as well as the General Purpose Machine Gun L7A1. Sniper teams are equipped with the Accuracy International sniper rifle while the anti-tank troops embedded within the infantry platoons carry the RPG-7 rocket launcher. Eight-man sections are deployed either on Landrovers or Iveco VM-90 trucks. The AFM also operates a number of Bedford trucks which, despite their age, still give excellent service. Suffice to say that these trucks were driven in convoys all the way to Kosovo and back three times in 2001 and not one of them broke down. The Explosives Ordnance Disposal Unit is equipped with two remote controlled Explosive Ordnance Disposal Vehicles \u2013 robots used to disable a bomb from a safe distance. The first was bought in 1989 and a second, much more sophisticated one, was bought last year. The Air Defence Battery forms part of 2nd Regiment and operates Bofors 40L/70 anti-aircraft guns and four barrelled ZSU-4 heavy machine guns. The Bofors guns can be operated either manually or electrically and they can be laid on their targets either visually or through radar. The 14.5mm machine guns can only be operated manually but they provide a high rate of fire. Air defence posed particular problems because of the passage of time on the Bofors guns, built in the early 1950s. === Aircraft === See: AFM aircraft === Maritime Patrol Vessels === See: AFM maritime patrol vessels === Vehicles === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |+ |- ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Model ! style=\"width:0%;\"|Image ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Origin ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Type ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Number ! style=\"width:40%;\"|Notes |- |Land Rover Defender |150px | |SUV | | Model 110 \u2013 300TDI. |- |Iveco VM 90 |150px | |SUV | | |- |Iveco ACM 90 |150px | |Truck | | |- |Iveco Daily |150px | |Van | | |- |} === Weapons === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |+ |- ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Model ! style=\"width:0%;\"|Image ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Origin ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Type ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Caliber ! style=\"width:40%;\"|Notes |- |Beretta 92 |150px | |Semi-automatic pistol |9\u00d719mm Parabellum |Model Beretta 92FS. |- |Heckler & Koch MP5 |150px | |Submachine gun |9\u00d719mm Parabellum |Models MP5K, MP5A4, and MP5A5. |- |AK-47 |150px | |Assault rifle |7.62\u00d739mm |Various versions from different countries. |- | Beretta ARX160 | 150px | | Assault rifle | 5.56\u00d745 mm | Used by Special ForcesSwiss-armed, US-trained: Maltese response team behind raid on migrant- hijacked ship |- | SIG MCX | 150px | | Assault rifle | 5.56\u00d745 mm | Used by Boarding UnitSwiss-armed, US-trained: Maltese response team behind raid on migrant-hijacked ship |- |Accuracy International Arctic Warfare |150px | |Sniper rifle |7.62\u00d751mm NATO * * * .300 Winchester Magnum |Two variants with different calibers in service. |- |PK machine gun |150px | |General-purpose machine gun |7.62\u00d754mmR |Some Chinese Type 80 variants in service. |- |FN MAG |150px | |General-purpose machine gun |7.62\u00d751mm NATO | |- |M2 Browning |150px | |Heavy machine gun |.50 BMG | |- |RPG-7 |150px | |Rocket-propelled grenade |40mm |12 RPG-7M donated by China.
