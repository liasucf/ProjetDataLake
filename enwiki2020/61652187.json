Known for its pro-Russian stance, the group is led by Philippe Milliau and Martial Bild, a former Front National leader. TV Libert\u00e9s is recognized by observers for its professionalism when compared to other French far-right channels, and it seeks to compete with mainstream cable TV. Alain de Benoist and Gilbert Collard, among others, have hosted talk shows on the channel. == History == === Background === Former logo of TV Libert\u00e9s. The project was initiated as \"Notre antenne\" by Philippe Millau (former GRECE and Bloc Identitaire) and Gilles Arnaud (former Front National). In 2013, the founders called for donations, hoping to raise around 1.5 million euros. Numerous far-right figures responded by sponsoring the project, among them Jean-Yves Le Gallou, Yvan Blot, Robert M\u00e9nard, , Paul- Marie Co\u00fbteaux, Renaud Camus, Yvan Blot, Bruno M\u00e9gret, Pierre Descaves, Michel Marmin, Roger Holeindre, Jean-Michel Dubernard, Bernard Lugan, and Jean Raspail. TV Libert\u00e9s was officially launched on YouTube in January 2014. === Development === TV Libert\u00e9s promotes pro-Russian views regarding international relations. In September 2014 it was the only TV channel allowed to cover a meeting of Sergey Naryshkin held at the Russian embassy in Paris. During the informal parliamentary election held in the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, TV Libert\u00e9s was allowed to cover the work of the French \"election monitor\", Jean-Luc Shaffhauser. Since 2017, it broadcasts a video talk show, Le Plus d'\u00c9lements, hosted by Olivier Fran\u00e7ois in collaboration with the Nouvelle Droite magazine \u00c9l\u00e9ments. In June 2018, the YouTube channel was shutdown due to \"infringement to copyright\", which led to critical reactions from Front National members, including its leader Marine Le Pen. The organization started to publish videos again on YouTube in February 2019. == Organization == TV Libert\u00e9s is directed by Philippe Milliau, the president of the channel, and Martial Bild, who serves as its editor-in-chief. The group also owns a radio station named \"Radio Libert\u00e9s\". == Guests == The aim of the channel is to bridge far-right and mainstream right-wing figures. Several FN politicians have been interviewed, including Thierry Mariani, Marion Mar\u00e9chal, Nicolas Bay, Louis Aliot, and Bruno Gollnisch. Various figures of the French right have also been invited, such as Jean-Marie Le Pen, Philippe de Villiers, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Christine Boutin, or . ==References== Category:Internet television Category:2014 establishments in France Category:Far-right politics in France ",
