    "text": "Things That We Drink To is the second studio album, and first American released by Australian country music singer Morgan Evans. The album was announced on 31 August 2018 and was released on 12 October 2018. The project is a musical reflection of Evans' journey from Australia to Nashville. Evans co-wrote each track alongside the album's producer, Chris DeStefano. The two played every instrument heard on the sonically diverse project, showcasing Evans' musicianship in addition to his adept songwriting. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, the album was won the ARIA Award for ARIA Award for Best Country Album. ==Background== In 2016, Evans travelled from Australia to Nashville, Tennessee to make a new home in the United States. Morgan began songwriting and working alongside some of the industry's best who've helped him turn this journey into 11 songs. Evans told Taste of Country \"I've learned to be more honest and tell my story rather than the story that I think someone wants to hear.\" Evans wrote hundreds of songs and culled the parts of his identity he hadn't yet shared into an album. Since moving to Nashville, Evans married fellow country star Kelsea Ballerini, embarked on his first American tour and released his first U.S. radio single, \"Kiss Somebody\" and lost his manager Rob Potts who died in a motor cycle accident in October 2017. ==Critical reception== Taste of Country said \"Celebration is an overall theme of Things That We Drink To as Evans looks back on the times that have defined him since he started building a new life on the other side of the world.\" Chris Parton from Rolling Stone said called the album a \"...breezy mix of up- tempo jams, lovestruck anthems and loop-driven creative mojo.\" adding \"Things That We Drink To a truly revealing debut, both personally and artistically.\" ==Commercial performance== Things That We Drink To debuted at No. 9 on Top Country Albums with 4,000 copies sold, or 7,000 in equivalent album units. The album has sold 5,200 copies in the United States as of November 2018. ==Track listing== From Nash Country Daily: # \"American\" (Morgan Evans, Chris DeStefano, Josh Osborne) \u2013 3:03 # \"Kiss Somebody\" (Evans, DeStefano, Osborne) \u2013 3:32 # \"I Do\" (Evans, DeStefano, Ashley Gorley) \u2013 3:29 # \"Song for the Summer\" (Evans, DeStefano, David Hodges) \u2013 3:32 # \"Day Drunk\" (Evans, DeStefano, Lindy Robbins) \u2013 3:14 # \"Dance with Me\" (featuring Kelsea Ballerini) (Evans, DeStefano) \u2013 3:19 # \"Me on You\" (Evans, DeStefano, Osborne) \u2013 3:26 # \"Things That We Drink To\" (Evans, DeStefano, Osborne) \u2013 3:08 # \"We Dream\" (Evans, DeStefano, Jaren Johnston, Jon Nite) \u2013 3:36 # \"Everything Changes\" (Evans, DeStefano, Blair Daly) \u2013 3:17 # \"Young Again\" (Evans, DeStefano, Josh Kear) \u2013 2:55 ==Personnel== *Kelsea Ballerini \u2013 duet vocals on \"Dance with Me\" *Chris DeStefano \u2013 banjo, bass guitar, drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, piano, programming, background vocals *Morgan Evans - acoustic guitar, lead vocals, background vocals *David Hodges \u2013 piano *Katie Ohh \u2013 background vocals *Kirby Smith \u2013 background vocals *Nir Z. \u2013 drums ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 106 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Country Albums (Billboard) | 9 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Country Albums (ARIA) | 18 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 94 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Country Albums (ARIA) | 4 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- | Australia | 12 October 2018 | | Warner Music Nashville, Warner Australasia | 9362490549 |} ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Morgan Evans (singer) albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:ARIA Award-winning albums ",
