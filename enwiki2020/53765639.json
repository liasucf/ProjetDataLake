    "text": "The Women's Euro Winners Cup is an annual continental beach soccer club competition contested between top-division European women's teams; the clubs that are their country's national league/championship champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) from countries all across Europe take part. Organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), the championship is viewed as the sport's version of the UEFA Women's Champions League in association football. Offering the strongest level of club competition on the old continent, it is the most prestigious women's club beach soccer championship in Europe, the winners becoming continental champions. Citing the many national women's leagues in Europe and one of their \"strongest commitments\" to develop women's beach soccer going into the year of the tournament's establishment, BSWW created the championship in 2016, following the founding of the men's edition in 2013. The tournament takes place within the framework of the larger men's version of the tournament, happening during the same dates and location over the course of about a week. Of the five editions to date, each has been won by a different club; Switzerland has produced the most winning sides (two). ==Organisation== As of 2017 ===Qualification=== The champions of each of Europe's national women's beach soccer leagues (or championships) qualify to play in the event. In countries where women's clubs exist but a national women's league or championship does not yet exist in that nation, clubs can contact BSWW to register themselves as that country's representative. If a national association wishes to enter additional clubs, they can request for permission to do so from the organisers BSWW who will grant or reject the clubs a berth at the tournament depending on the total number of teams already registered. ===Format=== The tournament starts with the group stage. The clubs are split into groups (typically of four) and compete in a round robin format. At the end of the group stage, the top eight clubs (group winners and best runners-up) advance to the knockout stage. The teams then compete in single- elimination matches; the quarter-finals, semi-finals and ending with the final. Consolation matches are also played to determine the final rankings involving the clubs knocked out of these rounds. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%;\" width=\"100%\" ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"3%\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"13%\"| Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"3%\"| \u2116 of clubs ! rowspan=8 width=\"1%\" | ! colspan=\"3\"|Final ! rowspan=8 width=\"1%\" | ! colspan=\"3\"|Third place play-off |- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\" ! width=\"16%\" |Champions ! width=\"7%\" |Result ! width=\"17%\" |Runners-up ! width=\"17%\" |3rd place ! width=\"7%\" |Result ! width=\"16%\" |4th place |- align=\"center\" | 2016 | Catania, Italy | 12 | align=\"right\" |Grasshoppers | 5\u20134 | align=\"left\" | BeachKick Berlin | align=\"right\" |Zvezda | 5\u20133 | align=\"left\" | Catanzaro |- align=\"center\" style=\"background: #D0E6FF;\" | 2017 | Nazar\u00e9, Portugal | 19 | align=\"right\" |Havana Shots Aargau | '''''' | align=\"left\" | Portsmouth | align=\"right\" |Higicontrol Melilla | 4\u20133 | align=\"left\" | Zvezda |- align=\"center\" | 2018 | Nazar\u00e9, Portugal | 20 | align=\"right\" |Zvezda | 2\u20130 | align=\"left\" | Portsmouth | align=\"right\" |AIS Playas de San Javier | 3\u20131 | align=\"left\" | Amn\u00e9ville |- align=\"center\" style=\"background: #D0E6FF;\" | 2019 | Nazar\u00e9, Portugal | 20 | align=\"right\" |AIS Playas de San Javier | '''''' | align=\"left\" | Madrid | align=\"right\" |Stade de Reims | 9\u20133 | align=\"left\" | Lokrians |- align=\"center\" | 2020 | Nazar\u00e9, Portugal | 5 | align=\"right\" |Mriya 2006 | [round-robin] | align=\"left\" | C\u00e1ceres | align=\"right\" |Zvezda | [round-robin] | align=\"left\" | Marseille |} :A.
