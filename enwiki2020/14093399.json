    "text": "Lady A (formerly known as Lady Antebellum) is an American country music group formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 2006. The group is composed of Hillary Scott (lead and background vocals), Charles Kelley (lead and background vocals, guitar), and Dave Haywood (background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer Linda Davis, and Kelley is the brother of pop singer Josh Kelley. The band abbreviated the name to \"Lady A\" in June 2020 amid the George Floyd protests in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with slavery and the Antebellum South, inadvertently causing a dispute with Black gospel singer Anita White, who had already been using that same name for more than 20 years. The group made its debut in 2007 as guest vocalists on Jim Brickman's single \"Never Alone\", before signing to Capitol Nashville. Lady A has released six albums for Capitol: Lady Antebellum, Need You Now, Own the Night, Golden, 747, Heart Break, plus one Christmas album (On This Winter's Night), and one for BMLG Records: Ocean. The first three albums are certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The albums have produced sixteen singles on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, of which nine have reached number one. The longest-lasting number one single is \"Need You Now\", which spent five weeks at that position in 2009; both that song and 2011's \"Just a Kiss\" reached number one on the Adult Contemporary charts. Lady A was awarded Top New Duo or Group by the Academy of Country Music and New Artist of the Year by the Country Music Association in 2008. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards and two more at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, winning Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for \"I Run to You\". It was awarded Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year (\"Need You Now\"), and Single of the Year (\"Need You Now\") at the 44th ACM Awards on April 18, 2010. It won five awards at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Need You Now\". Lady Antebellum also scored \"Best Country Album\" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. By August 2013, the group had sold more than 12.5 million digital singles and 10 million albums in the United States. ==History== ===2006\u20132007: Formation and early career=== The band was formed as Lady Antebellum in 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee, by Charles Kelley, Dave Haywood, and Hillary Scott. Scott is the daughter of country music singer Linda Davis, best known for her duet vocals on Reba McEntire's 1993 hit \"Does He Love You\", and Charles Kelley is the brother of pop and country artist Josh Kelley. Hillary Scott attended Donelson Christian Academy in Donelson, Tennessee. Kelley moved to Nashville in mid-2005 from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he had been working construction with his brother John. Trying to become a successful solo country artist, Kelley convinced his old middle-school classmate, Haywood, to move to Nashville from Georgia in 2006 so they could write music together. Shortly thereafter, Scott recognized Kelley from Myspace, and they started to talk at a Nashville music club. Kelley invited Scott to join him and Haywood in the new group, which assumed the name Lady Antebellum. On the BBC Radio 2 Drivetime Show August 9, 2010, the band explained that the name comes from when the group did a photo shoot in historical costumes at antebellum houses. In American history, the Antebellum era was the period in the Southern United States before the Civil War. The trio then began performing at local venues in Nashville before being signed in July 2007 to a recording contract with Capitol Records Nashville. In an interview with Sirius Satellite Radio, Scott said she was rejected from auditions for American Idol twice, not even making it past the first round. ===2007\u20132009: Lady Antebellum=== Lady A performs in concert in 2008, showing Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott Shortly after the trio signed to the label, it was chosen by recording artist Jim Brickman to sing on his 2007 single \"Never Alone,\" which reached No. 14 on the Billboard adult contemporary charts. In mid-2007, the group also wrote a song for the MTV reality television series The Hills. The solo debut single \"Love Don't Live Here\" was released in September 2007, with a music video for the song following in December. This song was the lead-off single to the band's debut album. Released on April 15, 2008, Lady Antebellum was produced by Paul Worley along with Victoria Shaw, a Nashville songwriter and former solo artist. \"Love Don't Live Here\" reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The album itself was the first album by a new duo or group to debut at Number One on the Billboard Top Country Albums charts. A second single, \"Lookin' for a Good Time\", was released in June 2008 and peaked at No. 11 in December. In addition, Lady A was signed as an opening act on Martina McBride's Waking Up Laughing Tour in 2008. The group also contributed the song \"I Was Here\" to the AT&T; Team USA Soundtrack, a song which peaked at No. 24 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 based on downloads. In December 2008, the rendition of \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" peaked at No. 3 on the same chart. The band's third official single, \"I Run to You\", was released in January 2009. It eventually became the trio's first Number One in July 2009. On October 7, 2009, their debut album was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies in the United States. Haywood and Kelley co-wrote labelmate Luke Bryan's 2009 single \"Do I\", on which the group also sings backing vocals. This song is the first single from Bryan's second studio album \"Doin' My Thing\", which was released on October 6, 2009. ===2009\u20132011: Need You Now=== In August 2009, the group released its fourth single, \"Need You Now\", the lead-off single and title track to the second studio album, which was also produced by Worley. It debuted at No. 50 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and became its second number 1 hit on the charts for the week of November 28, 2009. The song also reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot Adult Contemporary chart, making it a crossover hit. A second single, \"American Honey\", was released to radio on January 11, 2010 and would become its third No. 1 hit. The third single from the album, \"Our Kind of Love\", was released on May 31, 2010 and went No. 1 in September 2010. The song was notable for being written in collaboration with a non-Nashville songwriter busbee, who at that point had previously written for Katy Perry, Timbaland and Katharine McPhee. The fourth single from this album, \"Hello World\", was officially released on October 4, 2010. The album was released on January 26, 2010, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts for the week of February 2, 2010, selling 480,922 copies. Four weeks after the album's release, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Charles Kelley said, \"We actually just went ahead and decided we're gonna take two, two and a half months straight in the studio to create this thing and not have all this distraction. Hopefully that will be a good thing\". On May 2, 2011, the group released the first single from its upcoming album, titled \"Just a Kiss\". The group performed the single on stage on American Idols result show on May 5, 2011. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting and peaking at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the band's highest debut on the chart. It also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs, making it the band's fifth number-one single on the chart. On June 7, 2011, the title of third album was announced, Own the Night, and was released on September 13, 2011. The album cover and track listing was released on July 18, 2011. All together, four singles were released from Own the Night. Follow-up singles were \"We Owned the Night\", \"Dancin' Away with My Heart\", and \"Wanted You More\", which charted moderately in the Hot Country Songs.

The trio appeared on NBC's Songland and released the song \"Champagne Night\" on April 13, 2020. ===Name controversy=== The band members have always said that the band's name was chosen arbitrarily, complaining about the difficulty of choosing a name. Inspired by the \"country\" style nostalgia of a photo shoot at a mansion from the Antebellum South, they said, \"one of us said the word and we all kind of stopped and said, man, that could be a name\" and \"Man that's a beautiful Antebellum house, and that's cool, maybe there's a haunted ghost or something in there like Lady Antebellum.\" Haywood concluded, \"[We] had a lady in the group, obviously, and threw Lady in the front of it for no reason. I wish we had a great resounding story to remember for the name, but it stuck ever since.\" Having grown up in the South, ignorant of the word's glorification of the Civil War and slavery according to the popular propaganda of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, they chose the name. The name was always controversial, with a critic in Ms. Magazine writing in 2011 that the band's name \"seems to me an example of the way we still \u2014 nearly 150 years after the end of the Civil War, nearly 50 years after the Civil Rights Act; and in a supposedly post-racial country led by a biracial president \u2014 glorify a culture that was based on the violent oppression of people of color\". On June 11, 2020, joining widespread commercial response to the George Floyd protests, the band announced it would abbreviate its name to its existing nickname \"Lady A\" in an attempt to blunt the name's racist connotations. The band members stated on social media that, never having previously sought the dictionary definition of the word \"\", they now consulted their \"closest black friends and colleagues\" so that their \"eyes opened wide to the injustices, inequality and biases black women and men have always faced and continue to face every day. Now, blind spots we didn't even know existed have been revealed\". Fan response was mixed, with many decrying virtue signaling or even disparaging the protests. American Songwriter said, \"Given that the world knows what that A stands for, to many this change does little more than add extra insult to this ongoing injury.\" The next day, it was widely reported that the name \"Lady A\" had already been in use for more than 20 years by Seattle-based African American activist and blues, soul, funk, and gospel singer Anita White. The band again admitted ignorance of any prior use, which White called \"pure privilege\". Interviewed by Rolling Stone, White described the band's token acknowledgement of racism while blithely appropriating an African American artist's name: \"They're using the name because of a Black Lives Matter incident that, for them, is just a moment in time. If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before. It shouldn't have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it. It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist\". A veteran music industry lawyer observed that such name clashes are uncommon due to the existence of the Internet. The band members contacted White the next week to apologize for having inadvertently co-opted and dominated her name, saying that the Black Lives Matter movement had inspired them to a collaborative attitude. They nonetheless required retaining the same name, though she believed dual-naming is inherently impossible. She said \"We talked about attempting to co-exist but didn't discuss what that would look like\" because the band members would not directly respond to that explicit question three times during the conversation or in two contract drafts. She soon submitted a counteroffer that either the band would be renamed, or that her act would be renamed for a $5 million fee plus a $5 million donation to be split between Seattle charities, a nationwide legal defense fund for independent artists, and Black Lives Matter. On July 8, 2020, the band filed a lawsuit against White, asking a Nashville court to affirm its longstanding trademark of the name. The press release read: \"Today we are sad to share that our sincere hope to join together with Anita White in unity and common purpose has ended. She and her team have demanded a $10 million payment, so reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name Lady A, a trademark we have held for many years\". On September 15, 2020, White filed a counter-suit asserting her claim to the Lady A trademark and rejecting the notion that both artists could operate in the same industry under the same brand identity. She is seeking damages for lost sales and a weakened brand, along with royalties from any income the band receives under the Lady A moniker. ==Charity== Since January 2012, Lady A has been partnered with the charity myLIFEspeaks, to raise awareness of and provide facilities for disabled orphans in Haiti. At the start of the year 2013, the members of the group also created the fund called LadyAID, which was created in hopes of bringing awareness to children who suffer and cannot help themselves locally, nationally and around the world. The main focus of LadyAID is the children in hospitals, mainly in the United States and Canada.Dauphin, Chuck. \"GOODWORKS.\" Ebsco Host. Ebsco Industries, 2014. Web.
