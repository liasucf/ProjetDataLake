    "text": "\u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa (also Thorsdrapa; Old Norse: 'The Lay of Thor') is a skaldic poem by Eil\u00edfr Go\u00f0r\u00fanarson, a poet in the service of Jarl H\u00e1kon Sigur\u00f0arson. The poem is noted for its creative use of kennings and other metaphorical devices, as well as its labyrinthine complexity. ==Narrative synopsis== The principal subject of the poem is a narrative relating as to how Thor came by his hammer, Mjolnir (Mj\u01eblnir), and, as is usually the case in stories with Thor, how the giants came off worse. Behind it all, of course, is Loki, who gulls Thor into a confrontation with the giant Geirrod (Geirr\u01eb\u00f0r). With the aid of some magical gifts from the giantess Grid (Gr\u00ed\u00f0r), Thor, accompanied by \u00dej\u00e1lfi, defeats Geirrod and kills a number of other giants. The narrative begins with an account of the trickery of Loki in inciting Thor to make war again against the giants; \u00dej\u00e1lfi joins up with Thor but Loki is altogether more reluctant to the point of not going. The narrative then details Thor's (highly metaphorical) crossing of the oceans to J\u00f6tunheimr, with \u00dej\u00e1lfi hanging onto his waist band. Being a drapa (dr\u00e1pa) the poem is rich in praise of Thor and \u00dej\u00e1lfi's valour in making the difficult crossing. They are immediately set upon by a gang of giants from the cave of Geirrod, but Thor and Thjalfi (\u00dej\u00e1lfi) quickly put them to flight (although in Snorri's version of the tale \u00dej\u00e1lfi is replaced with Loki). Thor is then brought into Geirrod's house whereupon the seat he is sitting in is raised to the ceiling crushing him, however he strikes the ceiling with the stick given to him by Grid and he descends crushing two giantesses, daughters of Geirrod, beneath him. Geirrod then invites Thor to play a game, and throws a lump of molten iron at him which he (Thor) catches in his iron gloves. Geirrod hides behind a pillar and then Thor throws the iron through the pillar and giant. ==Analogues== The myth related in the poem is also preserved in prose form by Snorri Sturluson in the Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l and a looser analogue is found in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum. There are a number of discrepancies between Snorri's and Eil\u00edfr's versions of the myth; for example \u00dej\u00e1lfi is not present in the story in Snorri's Edda while he has a prominent role in \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa. ==Other \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pur== Two (fragments of) poems are sometimes referred to as \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa: * three half- stanzas written by Eysteinn Valdason in the 10th century relating Thor's fishing expedition to kill J\u00f6rmungandr; * one stanza and two verses composed by \u00deorbj\u00f6rn d\u00edsarsk\u00e1ld in the 10th or 11th century, the stanza consisting of a list of giants and giantesses killed by Thor. Both were preserved only in the Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l (4). ==References== * J\u00f6rmungrund: \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa Old Norse text with English translation and detailed analysis. * Entry in the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages project.
