    "text": "Ladies View, Lakes of Killarney Ladies View is a scenic viewpoint on the Ring of Kerry tourist route about from Killarney along the N71 road to Kenmare, in the Killarney National Park in Ireland. The Irish Times ranked Ladies View as one of the most photographed places in Ireland, while the Daily Edge ranked the views amongst Ireland's finest on Instagram. The name Ladies View (sometimes spelt Ladies' View), stems from the admiration of the view given by Queen Victoria's ladies-in-waiting during Victoria's 1861 visit to Ireland. In October 2017, a tourist couple almost drove their rental car over the edge of the cliff and into the valley below. The main viewpoint has a small car park, and a cafe called Ladies View Industries. ==Gallery== File:Ladies View Sign Kerry.jpg|Ladies View Sign File:Killarney National Park - Ladies View.jpg|Ladies View in May File:Ladies View, Ring of Kerry (12282951274).jpg|Ladies View in Autumn File:Ladies View (2012).jpg|Ladies View ==See also== * Moll's Gap * Gap of Dunloe * Black Valley * Torc Waterfall ==References== ==External links== * LadiesView.com, website of Ladies View Industries, Killarney Category:Geography of County Kerry Category:Tourist attractions in County Kerry Category:Overlooks ",
