Her brother was the musician Nick Drake, whose work she has consistently helped to promote since his death in 1974. ==Life and career== ===Early life=== Drake was born in Lahore, British India, the daughter of Rodney Drake and amateur songwriter Molly Drake. Her father was an engineer working for the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation. The family moved from Burma to Britain when she was eight.
