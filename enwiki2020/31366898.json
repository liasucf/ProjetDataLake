    "text": "The Serbian football league system is a series of interconnected leagues for association football clubs in Serbia. The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. ==Format== The number of teams promoted between leagues or divisions varies, and promotion is usually contingent on meeting criteria set by the higher league, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances. The top two levels contain one league each. Below this, the levels have progressively more parallel leagues, which each cover progressively smaller geographic areas. The top two leagues are under direct jurisdiction of the Serbian Football Association. From the 3rd level on, divided geographically into 4 leagues, the leagues are under the jurisdiction of one of the 4 football association subdivisions, Belgrade, East, Vojvodina and West. In the top of the pyramid is the Serbian SuperLiga containing 16 clubs as of 2010\u201311 season. Below the SuperLiga is found the Serbian First League containing 18 clubs. The last 4 are relegated into the Srpska Liga, the 3rd level, divided into 4 leagues Serbian League Belgrade, Serbian League East, Serbian League Vojvodina and Serbian League West every one of them containing 16 clubs. Until 2006 the clubs from Montenegro were also included, and the league's structure below and including 3rd level was slightly different because of it. The current Serbian league system is partially inherited from the pre-1992 Yugoslav league system, being back then the current 3rd tier, the Serbian League, unified and it was one of the 6 republic leagues forming the 4th level in the Yugoslav league pyramid, being under First and Second Federal League and Inter-republican Leagues. ==Present system== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ace1af;\"|Serbian SuperLiga The Champion qualifies for UEFA Champions League. 2nd & 3rd placed teams qualify for UEFA Europa League. 4th placed team has a chance to qualify for UEFA Europa League depending on the Serbian Cup outcome. |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fbe08d;\"|Serbian First League 1st & 2nd placed achieve direct Promotion to Serbian SuperLiga. 3rd placed plays a Promotion Play-Off against 14th placed team from Serbian SuperLiga. 4th placed plays a Promotion Play-Off against 13th placed team from Serbian SuperLiga. |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ebc9fe;\" width=\"25%\"| Serbian League West Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian First League. | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#ebc9fe;\" width=\"25%\"| Serbian League East Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian First League. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#ebc9fe;\" width=\"25%\"| Serbian League Belgrade Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian First League. | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#ebc9fe;\" width=\"25%\"| Serbian League Vojvodina Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian First League. |- | style=\"text- align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"6.25%\"| West Morava Zone League Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League West. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"6.25%\"| Podunavlje-\u0160umadija Zone League Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League West. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"6.25%\"| Kolubara-Ma\u010dva Zone League Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League West. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"6.25%\"| \u0160umadija-Ra\u0161ka Zone League Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League West. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Zone League West Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League East. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Zone League East Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League East. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Zone League South Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League East. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Zone League Centre Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League East. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"25%\"| Belgrade Zone League 1st & 2nd placed achieve Promotion to Serbian League Belgrade. | style=\"text- align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Vojvodina League North Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League Vojvodina. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Vojvodina League East Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League Vojvodina. | style=\"text-align:center; background:#c1ddfd;\" width=\"8.3%\"| Vojvodina League South Winner achieves Promotion to Serbian League Vojvodina. |- | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| | style=\"text-align:center; background:#FF8000;\"| |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fbe08d;\"|''' 6-th tier Serbian Intermunicipal League (52 divisions) |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fbe08d;\"|''' 7-th tier Serbian Municipal League (57 divisions) |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; background:white;\"|Serbian Cup Cup Winner qualifies for UEFA Europa League.
