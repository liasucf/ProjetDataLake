one ES111 each were needed for vertical and horizontal deflection; the output power for the deflection yoke was extracted not from the anode, but from the screen grid, the sync pulses were applied to the suppressor grid via a separate pin. The anode acted only as a small-signal amplified/gated-sync output which was added to the feedback from an auxiliary winding on the deflection yoke, and fed to the control grid. As there was no vertical deflection output transformer, a secondary, magnetically decoupled vertical deflection yoke received a variable, smoothed-out part of the screen grid current to compensate for its DC component in the primary vertical deflection yoke; it was variable to adjust the vertical picture position on the CRT screen. The screen grid delivered enough power even for an EHT winding on the horizontal deflection output transformer and for the 6.3V/0.2A heater of an RFG5 16-kV EHT rectifier.
