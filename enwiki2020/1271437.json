She was the first cousin of composer Edvard Grieg, whom she married. ==Career== The couple often performed concerts together in Europe; on 6 December 1897, they performed some of his music at a private concert at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and her court. Her husband Edvard considered her the best performer of his songs, and her performances usually received rave reviews. However, one of Victoria's courtiers called her singing \"pass\u00e9e\". She was featured as a soloist in Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah with Musikselskabet Harmonien (later known as the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1866.https://www.nb.no/items/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010062508025 Haavet, Inger Elisabeth (1998): Nina Grieg: kunstner og kunstnerhustru, p. 65 The English composer Frederick Delius dedicated two sets of songs to her in the years 1888\u20131890.

Nina and Edvard identified as Unitarians. After his death in 1907, she moved to Denmark. In Copenhagen, she attended a Unitarian church. She died in 1935 at the age of 90. She was cremated and her ashes were placed with her husband's' ashes in a mountain tomb near Troldhaugen, outside Bergen, where the couple had shared a home for most of their married years. ==Literature== *Haavet, Inger Elisabeth (1998): Nina Grieg.
