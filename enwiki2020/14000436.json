    "text": "Hot Water is the sixteenth studio album by American popular music singer- songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was released in June 1988 by MCA 42093 and was produced by Coral Reefer Band members Michael Utley, Russell Kunkel, and Ralph MacDonald. The album was engineered and mixed by Jay Rifkin. The album was Jimmy's first album recorded at his new studio in Key West, Florida called Shrimpboat Sound.http://www.margaritaville.com/about-jimmy The LP continues Buffett's use of a wide variety of musical instruments than was typical for Buffett's earlier works, notably horns and percussion. Buffett shaved off his trademark mustache for the album. ==Songs== All but two of the album's songs were written or co-written by Buffett. The other two songs are cover songs: \"Great Heart\" originally by South African Johnny Clegg and Savuka and \"L'Air de la Louisiane\" by Jesse Winchester, one of several Buffett covers of Winchester songs recorded throughout his career. \"L'Air de la Louisiane\" An admitted francophile, Buffett has sung several songs in French. The album's Final Song, \"That's What Living is to Me\" references Mark Twain's Travelogue \"Following the Equator\" and Jimmy often includes praise and recommendation of the book when introducing live performances of the song. ==Chart performance== Hot Water reached No. 46 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The song \"Bring Back the Magic\" hit No. 24 Adult Contemporary. ==Track listing== #\"Homemade Music\" (Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley, Russell Kunkel) \u2013 3:32 #\"Baby's Gone Shoppin'\" (Jimmy Buffett) \u2013 4:05 #\"Bring Back the Magic\" (Jimmy Buffett, Will Jennings) \u2013 4:16 #\"My Barracuda\" (Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley, Russell Kunkel, Steve Cropper) \u2013 3:37 #\"L'Air de la Louisiane\" (Jesse Winchester) \u2013 2:59 #\"Prince of Tides\" (Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley) \u2013 5:30 #\"Pre-You\" (Jimmy Buffett, Ralph MacDonald, William Salter) \u2013 5:19 #\"King of Somewhere Hot\" (Jimmy Buffett, Ralph MacDonald, William Salter, Robert Greenidge) \u2013 5:05 #\"Great Heart\" (Johnny Clegg) \u2013 5:06 #\"Smart Woman (In a Real Short Skirt)\" (Jimmy Buffett, Marshall Chapman) \u2013 2:49 #\"That's What Living Is to Me\" (Jimmy Buffett) \u2013 4:33 ==Personnel== The Coral Reefer Band: *Jimmy Buffett \u2013 acoustic and electric guitar *Steve Cropper \u2013 electric guitar *Hugh McCracken \u2013 acoustic guitar, mandolin, dobro, bass harmonica & lead guitar on \"Prince of Tides\" *Jeff Mironov \u2013 electric guitar on \"Pre-You\" *Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums, percussion *Buddy Williams \u2013 drums on \"King of Somewhere Hot\" and \"Pre-You\" *Michael Utley \u2013 keyboards, organ, synthesizers *Steve Winwood \u2013 organ, background vocals on \"My Barracuda\" *Richard Tee \u2013 piano on \"Pre-You\" *Donald Dunn \u2013 bass *Marcus Miller \u2013 bass on \"King of Somewhere Hot\" *Anthony Jackson \u2013 bass on \"That's What Living Is to Me\" *Alex Blake \u2013 bass on \"Pre-You\" *Timothy B.

For most of the tour, however, the Mac McAnally cover \"It's My Job\" opened the show and \"Where's the Party\" closed the set. \"Fins\" was the show closer pretty much every night, with the exception of Van Morrison's \"Brown Eyed Girl\" closing the Kings Dominion show on the fourth of July, its only known appearance of the tour.
