    "text": "MTVU (formerly stylized as MtvU and mtvU) is an American digital cable television network owned by the Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks division of ViacomCBS. The channel was first known as VH1 Uno from 2000 to 2004 before changing names when Viacom expanded MTVU programming beyond more than 750 college and university campuses across the United States, as part of internally originated cable systems that are a part of on-campus housing or college closed-circuit television systems to digital cable in all homes. In 2018, the MTV Networks on Campus group was sold by Viacom to Cheddar to launch CheddarU, but the digital cable channel remained to the public through digital cable. Music videos played on the channel primarily consist of indie rock, pop punk and hip-hop along with limited original programming. MTVU also formerly owned RateMyProfessors.com. ==History== MTV Networks' proposal for a channel targeting college students, tentatively called MTV University, became public in February 2002. According to The New York Times, the channel was seeking to compete with Burly Bear Network, which was available to 450 campuses and had been attracting nearly a million viewers a week, along with College Television Network (CTN) and the most recent entrant at the time, Zilo. Seven months later, after CTN wound up in financial trouble and as National Lampoon had just acquired the defunct Burly Bear, MTV Networks acquired CTN for $15 million. In February 2008, MTV Networks discontinued VH1 Uno, a sparsely viewed Spanish language music video channel, and replaced it with MTVU, to expand the channel into traditional cable distribution. In May 2018, Cheddar TV acquired Viacom's MTV Networks on Campus; outlets associated with that service will be converted to carry CheddarU, a new secondary feed which will stream content from the flagship financial-news streaming service and segments from Cheddar Big News to 9 million students on more than 600 campuses; universities which previously screened MTV Networks on Campus will continue to receive CheddarU at no cost in exchange for access to the campus (the cable version of MTVU has continued under an automated form). CheddarU is part of the ChedNet division of Cheddar, a division focusing on bringing the service to public screens such as gyms, bars, airports, hotel and other public venues. ==Programming== According to its promotional materials from 2004 to 2018, MTVU broadcast exclusive content dedicated to aspects of college life, including music, news, and on-campus events. The channel was the first MTV network to stream all of its content online. On-campus events included the Campus Invasion tour, featuring up-and- coming bands; the GAME0Rz Ball tour, which brings new video games to campus; and Tailgate Tour, which provides MTVU with a presence at campus tailgates. MTVU shows included Dean's List, the MTVU Awards, and MTVU Spring Break. Currently, MTVU plays a mix of music videos with an emphasis on emerging artists and short interestistial segments focusing on college life. Previously at each hour, MTVU broadcast news updates from ABC News (and before that CBS News until late 2006 in the wake of the Viacom/CBS split), including international news and college-related news. Twice an hour, MTV News once aired stories on subjects such as music downloading, and musical artists under promotion by MTVU. Additionally, MTVU aired several original programs produced by and featuring college students. The Freshmen featured three rotating student panelists discussing new music videos and was hosted by Kim Stolz; Stand-In brought celebrities and intellectuals into college classrooms to teach for a day, and featured people such as Nobel Laureates Elie Wiesel and Shimon Peres; Madonna; John McCain; Marilyn Manson; and Jhumpa Lahiri. It has also started a social networking site \"Meet or Delete\", along with HP. == Awards== === MTVU Woodie Awards === MTVU formerly broadcast its own semi- annual awards show, the MTV Woodies, which it states recognizes \"the music voted best by college students.\" Previous winners have included 2005's Death Cab for Cutie, Motion City Soundtrack, and The Afters; 2006 winners include Thirty Seconds to Mars, Plain White T's, mewithoutYou, The Subways and Gnarls Barkley.

Winners at the 2009 Woodie Awards included Green Day, Kings of Leon, Matt & Kim, NeverShoutNever, Tech N9ne and Hotel of the Laughing Tree. Winners at the 2014 Woodie Awards include Beyonc\u00e9, Drake, Ed Sheeran, and Skrillex. Fall Out Boy will become the first inductees at \"Hall of Wood\" at the 2015 Woodie Awards. They had won the Streaming Woodie award for \"Grand Theft Autumn\" at the first ceremony in 2004. === Awards for students === The online game Darfur is Dying was developed as part of an MTVU contest, and other Sudan genocide coverage won MTVU two Emmys, including the 2006 Governors Award. Its Half of Us initiative won a Peabody Award in 2007 \"for its extensive research and dedication to fighting depression and creating quick routes to convenient solutions.\" MTVU also provided grants for student activists, giving away $1,000 a week to various student groups. MTVU formerly co-sponsored the ecomagination Challenge with GE, which aimed to empower college students to solve environmental problems on campuses. MTVU also sponsored the Film Your Issue competition, a competition designed to encourage college-age filmmakers to make short political pieces, and aired the winners. Other opportunities that MTVU provided for college students include Digital Incubator grants, which awarded students who are pioneering the future of broadband content, and the Student Filmmaker Award, which provided the winner with the chance to receive a development deal with MTVU and collect the award at the MTV Movie Awards. Besides these competitions, MTVU made efforts to use student work through its programming. ===Winners=== Woodie of the Year *2004: Modest Mouse - \"Float On\" *2005: My Chemical Romance *2006: Angels & Airwaves *2007: Gym Class Heroes *2008: Paramore *2009: Kings of Leon *2010: Not Awarded Woodie of the Year *2011: Wiz Khalifa - \"Black and Yellow\" *2012: Mac Miller *2013: Machine Gun Kelly *2014: Drake *2015: Porter Robinson *2016: Not Awarded Woodie of the Year *2017: The Chainsmokers Breaking Woodie *2004: The Killers - \"Somebody Told Me\" *2005: Motion City Soundtrack *2006: Plain White T's *2007: Boys Like Girls *2008: Afterhour *2009: Never Shout Never *2010: Not Awarded Breaking Woodie *2011: Two Door Cinema Club *2012: Machine Gun Kelly *2013: Earl Sweatshirt *2014: The 1975 Left Field Woodie *2004: N.E.R.D - \"Maybe\" *2005: MewithoutYou *2006: Gnarls Barkley *2007: Madvillain *2008: Chromeo *2009: Tech N9ne *2010: Not Awarded Left Field Woodie *2011: Kanye West Good Woodie *2004: Sum 41 *2005: U2 *2006: Serj Tankian *2007: Guster *2008: Jack's Mannequin *2009: Jamie Tworkowski Road Woodie *2004: Coheed and Cambria *2005: Fall Out Boy *2006: Taking Back Sunday Streaming Woodie *2004: Fall Out Boy - \"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\" *2005: The Afters - \"Beautiful Love\" *2006 - O.A.R. - \"Love and Memories\" Welcome Back Woodie *2004: Incubus Soundtrack of My Life Woodie *2004: Coheed and Cambria - In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 The Jump Woodie *2004: Taking Back Sunday - \"A Decade Under the Influence\" The Silent But Deadly Woodie *2004: Modest Mouse - \"Float On\" Best Video Woodie *2005: Gorillaz - \"Feel Good Inc.\" (Best Video Woodie - Animation) *2005: Death Cab for Cutie - \"Title and Registration\" (Best Video Woodie - Live Action) *2006: Gorillaz - \"El Ma\u00f1ana\" (Best Video Woodie - Animation) *2006: Thirty Seconds to Mars - \"The Kill\" (Best Video Woodie - Live Action) *2007: Say Anything - \"Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too\" *2008: Motion City Soundtrack - \"It Had to Be You\" *2009: Matt and Kim - \"Lessons Learned\" *2010: Not Awarded Best Video Woodie *2011: Chiddy Bang - \"Opposite of Adults\" *2012: Best Coast - \"Our Deal\" *2013: Danny Brown - \"Grown Up\" *2014: Chance the Rapper, Saba & BJ the Chicago Kid - \"Everybody's Something\" *2015: Childish Gambino - \"Sober\" International Woodie *2005: Muse *2006: The Subways Alumni Woodie *2005: Green Day *2006: AFI *2007: Spoon Performing Woodie *2007: Muse *2008: Atmosphere *2009: Green Day *2010: Not Awarded Performing Woodie *2011: Matt and Kim *2012: Mac Miller *2013: Not Awarded Performing Woodie *2014: Ed Sheeran Best Music On Campus Woodie *2008: The Bride Wore Black *2009: Hotel of the Laughing Tree College Radio Woodie *2009: KUPS (University of Puget Sound) *2010: WICB (Ithaca College) *2011: WVUM (University of Miami) *2012: WASU-FM (Appalachian State University) *2013: KSUA (University of Alaska Fairbanks) *2014: WESS (East Stroudsburg University) *2015: WPTS-FM (University of Pittsburgh) EDM Effect Woodie *2012: Calvin Harris & Rihanna - \"We Found Love\" Fomo Woodie *2013: The Weeknd Tag Team Woodie *2013: Kimbra, Mark Foster & A-Trak - \"Warrior Branching Out Woodie *2013: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Chevrolet Sonic Collage Artist Woodie *2013: The Lonely Biscuits Cover Woodie *2014: Bastille - \"We Can't Stop\" (Miley Cyrus) *2015: Taylor Swift - \"Riptide\" (Vance Joy) *2016: Not Awarded Cover Woodie *2017: Ed Sheeran - \"Touch\" (Little Mix) Did it My Way Woodie *2014: Beyonc\u00e9 Best Collaboration Woodie *2014: ASAP Rocky, Skrillex & Birdy Nam Nam - \"Wild for the Night\" Woodie to Watch *2015: Years & Years *2016: Not Awarded Woodie to Watch *2017: Khalid Co-Sign Woodie *2015: Hoodie Allen & Ed Sheeran - \"All About It\" Next Level Performance Woodie *2015: Childish Gambino Social Climber Woodie *2015: Jack & Jack Woodie Songwriter of the Year *2017: PartyNextDoor ==References== ==External links== * Category:MTV channels Category:Music video networks in the United States Category:Television channels and stations established in 2008 Category:English-language television stations in the United States Category:Companies based in New York City ",
