No systems formed in the area, and thus no names were required. == See also == * Tropical cyclone * List of Pacific hurricanes * 1960 Atlantic hurricane season * 1960 Pacific typhoon season *1960 North Indian Ocean cyclone season * Pre-1980 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons ==References== Category:Pacific hurricane seasons Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines ",
