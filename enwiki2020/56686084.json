    "text": "\"Fotografia\" (also known as \"Photograph\") is a bossa nova song written and composed in 1959 by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim. English lyrics were published in 1965 by Ray Gilbert. \"Fotografia\" was one of Jobim's first compositions for which he wrote the words as well as the music. According to author Ruy Castro, this came about partly because Jobim's songwriting partner, Vinicius de Moraes, had left Rio de Janeiro to take up a diplomatic post in Montevideo, Uruguay, during much of 1958 and 1959. The change allowed Jobim to work with other lyricists, such as close friend Newton Mendon\u00e7a, Dolores Duran and Alo\u00edsio de Oliveira, and to try his hand at penning his own lyrics. Jazz critic Gary Giddins, writing in The New Yorker, referred to \"Fotografia\" as an \"ingenious\" composition full of \"flirtatious romance,\" while Mark Holston at Jazziz Magazine said the song was \"mesmerizing.\" Thom Jurek at AllMusic called it \"a tome of memory and longing.\" Brazilian vocalist Flora Purim, who recorded \"Fotografia\" on her 2001 album Perpetual Emotion, discussed the background of the song in an interview on National Public Radio, saying, \"in Brazil it's very common, all those illegal love affairs, people that are married but fall in love with other people that are married. So they would meet in the afternoon and be together until sunset, and then they'd have to go home to their families. And this song talks about a romance between two people and suddenly that kiss, you know, that goodbye kiss, 'I have to go now.' It\u2019s a song about forbidden love. . . . about love affairs in the late afternoon.\" \"Fotografia\" has been used as the title of other Jobim-related albums, including Wanda S\u00e1's 2014 Jobim tribute album, and a 2005 compilation from Planet Rhythm (Universal) entitled Fotografia: Os A\u00f1os Dourados de Tom Jobim that includes rarities, outtakes, and previously unreleased tracks. The first recording of \"Fotografia\" was by Sylvia Telles in 1959, on her album Amor De Gente Mo\u00e7a (Musicas De Antonio Carlos Jobim). Jobim recorded the song himself as an English-language vocal on his 1967 album, A Certain Mr. Jobim. == Recorded versions== * Sylvia Telles - Amor de Gente Mo\u00e7a (Musicas de Antonio Carlos Jobim) (1959) * Astrud Gilberto - The Astrud Gilberto Album (1965) * Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim - A Certain Mr. Jobim (1967) * Dick Farney \u2013 Dick Farney: Piano Orquestra: Gaya (1967); Dick Farney (1973) * Nara Le\u00e3o \u2013 Dez Anos Depois (1971) * Elis Regina & Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim \u2013 Elis & Tom (1974) * Ella Fitzgerald \u2013 Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim (1981) * Rosa Passos - Curare (1991) * Jo\u00e3o Gilberto - Eu Sei que Vou Te Amar (1994) * Joe Henderson - Double Rainbow: The Music of Antonio Carlos Jobim (1995) * Gal Costa - Gal Costa Canta Tom Jobim Ao Vivo (1999) * Dave Liebman Group \u2013 The Unknown Jobim (2001) *Jaques Morelenbaum, Paula Morelenbaum, and Ryuichi Sakamoto - Morelenbaum 2/Sakamoto: Casa (2001), A Day in New York (2003) *Flora Purim \u2013 Perpetual Emotion (2001) * Claudia Telles \u2013 Tributo a Tom Jobim (2001) * Palmyra & Levita with Jo\u00e3o Donato - Here's That Rainy Bossa Day (2002) * Eliane Elias \u2013 Dreamer (2004) * Antonio Adolfo & Carol Saboya - Ao Vivo Live (2006) * Lisa Ono - Music Of Antonio Carlos Jobim: Ipanema (2007) * Mark Murphy \u2013 Lucky To Be Me (2010) * Vanessa da Mata \u2013 Vanessa da Mata canta Tom Jobim (2013) * Wanda S\u00e1 \u2013 Photograph: The Song Of Antonio Carlos Jobim (2014) * Stacey Kent \u2013 I Know I Dream - The Orchestral Sessions (2017) ==References== Category:1959 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim Category:Songs with music by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim Category:Bossa nova songs Category:Brazilian songs Category:Portuguese-language songs ",
