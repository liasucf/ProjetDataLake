    "text": "Oncis is a genus of air-breathing sea slugs, a shell-less marine pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Onchidiidae. The name of this genus has gone through a lot of tribulations. It was originally named Onchis by F\u00e9russac in 1821. In 1822 Fleming named Peronia with the same type species. In 1847 Herrmannsen renamed Onchis F\u00e9russac as Oncis for unjustified reasons. In 1893 Plate created the new name Oncis not Herrmanssen. And in 1938 Baker replaced the name Oncis Plate, 1893 by Platevindex Baker, 1938 (with type species Platevindex coriaceum Semper, 1885).Benoit Dayrat, Onchidiidae, Diversity and Evolution However, Oncis Plate, 1893, is an available and potentially valid name, and Platevindex is an unnecessary replacement name as \"Oncis\" was not treated by Herrmannsen (1847) as the valid name of a taxon (ICZN Chapter 11 article 50.5) WoRMS : Platevindex ==Species== According to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), the following species with valid names are included within the genus Oncis :WoRMS : Oncis; accessed : 30 September 2010 * Oncis amboinae (Plate, 1893) * Oncis cinerea Odhner, 1917 * Oncis granulosa (Lesson, 1826) * Oncis lutea (Semper, 1885) * Oncis martensi Plate, 1893 * Oncis mortoni (Britton, 1984) * Oncis ponsonbyi (Collinge, 1901) * Oncis schneideri Hoffmann, 1932 * Oncis semperi Plate, 1893 * Oncis stuxbergi (Westerlund, 1883) ; Species brought into synonymy : * Oncis apoikistes (Tillier, 1983) : synonym of Semperoncis montana (Plate, 1893) * Oncis coeca Plate, 1893 accepted as Oncis amboinae (Plate, 1893) * Oncis inspectabilis Plate, 1893 accepted as Oncis stuxbergi (Westerlund, 1883) * Oncis lata Plate, 1893 accepted as Oncis granulosa (Lesson, 1826) * Oncis montana Plate, 1893 accepted as Semperoncis montana (Plate, 1893) ==References== * Category:Onchidiidae Category:Monotypic gastropod genera ",
