    "text": "S\u0103laj County () (also known as Land of Silvania, silva, -ae means \"forest\") is a county (jude\u021b) of Romania, located in the north-west of the country, in the historical regions of Cri\u0219ana and Transylvania. It is bordered to the north by Satu Mare and Maramure\u0219 counties, to the west and south-west by Bihor County, and to the south-east by Cluj County. Zal\u0103u is the county seat as well as its largest city. == Etymology == In Hungarian, it is known as Szil\u00e1gy megye, in Slovak as Sala\u0161sk\u00e1 \u017eupa, and in German as Kreis Zillenmarkt. The county is named after the river S\u0103laj, which gets its name from Hungarian Szil\u00e1gy \"elm creek\", composed from szil, \"elm\" and \u00e1gy \"riverbed\". == History == === Antiquity === On 28 July 1978, a team of speleologists discovered in the cave of Cuciulat Paleolithic paintings about 12,000 years old, unique in Romania. Called the \"Romanian Altamira\", this cave features several red paintings of animals, including horses and felines. These are the first manifestations of this kind known in Southeastern Europe. The first villages in the current territory of S\u0103laj County are 7,500 years old. The first ceramic pots in S\u0103laj area are about the same age. The first houses with several rooms were built in this county about 6,000 years ago. The only fully studied Bronze Age settlement in the Romanian territory is located in S\u0103laj County, in Recea. So far, 63 bronze artifacts have been discovered dating as far back as 17th\u20139th centuries BC. Bronze items from this period discovered in the S\u0103laj County are exhibited today in renowned museums in Germany, United States, Hungary, but also Bucharest. Six defense citadels were dated to the first Iron Age, 11th\u20134th centuries BC. === Daco-Roman period and early Middle Ages === Castra of Buciumi Body chain with 52 pendants, part of the treasure of \u0218imleu Silvaniei, is now exhibited at Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the current territory of S\u0103laj was occupied by Dacians. There was a Dacian tribal union between Crasna and Barc\u0103u rivers that controlled the access roads to the north-west, to and from Transylvania, as well as the commerce, especially the salt trade. From the Dacian period come no less than 23 Dacian thesauri, made of silver coins and ornaments. The 3,000 coins and 70 silver ornaments weigh in total about 13 kg. The largest fortified Dacian settlement in Romania was discovered in S\u0103laj County, dating from the 1st century AD. In total, in S\u0103laj County were discovered sites of 30 Dacian villages and 15 Dacian citadels defending the tribal union in the west of current county. These citadels were located on hills and were fortified with ditches and earth walls, on which were erected wooden palisades. The center of the tribal union was on M\u0103gura \u0218imleului, in a complex of settlements and fortifications. In the western half of the county, under Roman military control, subsequently settled the Vandals, that entered into alliance with Dacians, supported by the Romans to fight other barbarians. The Vandals arrived in the area during the 1st century AD, coming from the current territory of Denmark. Porta Praetoria at Porolissum Dezs\u0151 Citadel in Alma\u0219u. After conquering Dacia, Romans built on the place of a Dacian settlement the capital of Dacia Porolissensis, at Porolissum (current Moigrad). The capital Porolissum had about 20,000 inhabitants, defended by the militaries in the local castra. As a work of art should be mentioned the amphitheater, scale replica of the one in Rome, with a capacity of 6,000 seats. In 214 AD, Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antonius visited Porolissum. At Porolissum was quartered for a period Cohors III Dacorum, made of ethnic Dacians, who fought as infantry. In the S\u0103laj County area were identified nine Roman castra (Certinae, Largiana, Optatiana, Porolissum, Brusturi, Buciumi, Jac, Tih\u0103u and Zal\u0103u) and the limes (fortified border) of the province. In 275 AD, Roman authorities leave the province, but indigenous people continue to live the same territories. Their presence is attested archaeologically after leaving the region by the Roman imperial authorities. There followed the Gepids, which just passed through the area. Two Gepid gold thesauri discovered in \u0218imleu Silvaniei, weighing in total about 10 kg of gold and dating from the 5th century AD, are now exhibited in museums in Vienna and Budapest. In 6th\u20137th centuries AD arrive in the area Slavic tribes, who find here the native population. In early Middle Ages, in the 10th century AD, boundary between the voivodeship of Menumorut and that of Gelu was on Mese\u0219 Mountains. From early medieval period come more than 100 settlements identified in the S\u0103laj County (7th\u201313th centuries). Among the first counties organized in Transylvania was Crasna County, in 1090, part of the current S\u0103laj County. Byzantine chronicles and Anonymus' Gesta Hungarorum make the first mentions about Romanians in these places, about their forms of organization, as well as first documentary attestation of Zal\u0103u (1220 as villa Ziloc). === Under Kingdom of Hungary === Starting with the second half of the 11th century, Hungarians conquer systematically Transylvania which organize as autonomous Voivodate within the Kingdom of Hungary. During the Middle Ages, Transylvania politics was monopolized by Unio Trium Nationum (political alliance of nobles, Saxon and Sz\u00e9kely rulers formed during the Bob\u00e2lna revolt of 1437\u20131438). From 1526, Transylvania is included to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom that will become under Ottoman suzerainty, and in 1570 it transfoms to the Principality of Transylvania. After 1691, the Principality is subjected to the direct rule of the Habsburgs governors. In 1765, it transformed to the Grand Principality of Transylvania. After the formation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867), Transylvania disappears as state, being incorporated again to the Kingdom of Hungary. A county with an identical name (Szil\u00e1gy County, ) was created in 1876, covering a similar area. In Salaj County are medieval citadels and castles which belonged to noble families (Dragu, Jibou, G\u00e2rbou, \u0218imleu Silvaniei, etc.). Among them is Alma\u0219u Citadel () (nowadays, in ruins), built in the 13th century, property of Transylvanian voivodes, then of Petru Rare\u0219, Prince of Moldavia. Michael the Brave defeating the Hungarians in Gurusl\u0103u, 1601 The history of Salaj County includes an important episode related to historical facts of the maker of the first political union of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia under Michael the Brave. On 3 August 1601, armies led by Michael the Brave and Austrian general Giorgio Basta defeated the Hungarian noble army led by Prince Sigismund B\u00e1thory at Gurusl\u0103u (Goroszl\u00f3), near Zal\u0103u (Zilah) (where a memorial was erected). In the forefront of the struggle for national rights of Romanians have been often personalities of S\u0103laj County. Among Romanian revolutionaries of 1848 can be mentioned Alexandru Papiu Ilarian and Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu, who became the ideologist of the Romanian revolution in Transylvania. Following the establishment of the Romanian National Party in Transylvania (1869) and the adoption of \"passivist\" tactics (non-participation in the political life of Hungary), S\u0103laj leaders of the party participated in the largest protest during political passivism period, the \"Memorandist Movement\" (1892\u20131894). Was noticed the contribution of Gheorghe Pop de B\u0103se\u0219ti. The failure of political passivism determined the PNR leaders to pass to \"political activism\", starting with 1905. At the stage of political activism, the Transylvanian Romanians achieve representation in the Parliament in Budapest, there advocating for national rights. Was remarked the activity of Iuliu Maniu, the greatest politician in the history of S\u0103laj. In national and international favorable conditions of 1918, leaders of Romanians in Transylvania organized the Great National Assembly in Alba Iulia (1 December 1918), with plebiscitary character, which decided the union of Transylvania with Romania. Political elites in S\u0103laj had a leading role in the events. Gheorghe Pop de B\u0103se\u0219ti was elected president of the Great National Council (legislative body), Iuliu Maniu became president of the Governing Council (executive body), and Victor Deleu was the leader of the Interior within the Governing Council (the two institutions have led Transilvania during its provisional autonomy until April 1920). === After World War I === The territory of the county was transferred to Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. It was organized by Romanian officials as a county in 1925. Leaders of the Romanian National Party (from left): Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Miron Cristea and Iuliu Maniu Administrative map of interwar S\u0103laj County Hungarian Army troops entering in Zal\u0103u, 8 September 1940 In the interwar period, S\u0103laj evolved within the history of Greater Romania. Was remarked Iuliu Maniu's political activity, president of PNR, then president of PN\u021a and prime minister of Romania. At the beginning of Greater Romania, S\u0103laj County had 3,815 km2 and 226,716 inhabitants, of which: 139,878 Romanians, 70,405 Hungarians, 9,322 Slovaks, 831 Jews, 6,282 other nationalities. Legislation of Greater Romania offered the possibility of functioning of schools or departments in native languages. According to documents from the State Archives, S\u0103laj County, in 1933 had 342,642 inhabitants, of which: 202,176 Romanians, 90,800 Hungarians, 30,840 Germans, 17,138 Jews, 1,715 other nationalities. The number of students was: 44,921 Romanians, 20,192 Hungarians, 3,287 Germans, 2,111 Jews, 396 other nationalities. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. S\u0103laj County became part of \u021ainutul Cri\u0219uri. By Second Vienna Award, concluded on 30 August 1940, arbitrated by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Romania had to cede to Hungary Northern Transylvania. Until March 1945, when the ceded part will return to Romania (during Petru Groza government), S\u0103laj was part of Hungary again. Between 1940 and 1944, in Szil\u00e1gy County notable incidents happened, claiming the lives of 495 people, most of them culminating in the Ip and Treznea massacres. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania, re-establishing the county. Starting with 14 October 1944, Romanian armies carried military operations in the territory, however, the Romanian administration was expelled from these territories in October due to the activities of the Romanian paramilitary groups created in the area to avenge the atrocities committed by the Hungarians against the Romanians during the Hungarian rule in Northern Transylvania.Rogers Brubaker, Nationalist Politics and Everyday Ethnicity in a Transylvanian Town, Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 80 Romanian jurisdiction over the county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. After 1947, S\u0103laj inhabitants have experienced the realities of the Communist totalitarian regime. Among S\u0103laj personalities, can be mentioned artist Ioan Sima who, in 1980, donated to the County Museum of History and Art in Zal\u0103u paintings and graphics, personal archive and his library of art. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re- established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. After December 1989, in the conditions of return to a democratic political regime and Euro-Atlantic integration, S\u0103laj has become a model of interethnic cohabitation, also manifested in education. Politically, was remarked the activity of Corneliu Coposu, former personal secretary of Iuliu Maniu. His name links to the clotting of the Romanian Democratic Convention that succeeded the first democratic alternation in power in post-revolutionary Romania. == Geography == S\u0103laj County unfolds on 3,864.38 km2 (1.6% of the country area), of which 239,613 ha are agricultural land, 105,833 ha forests and 41,000 ha inhabited area. It is located in the north-west of the country, overlapping mostly in the area of connection between the Eastern Carpathians and Apuseni Mountains, known as \"Some\u0219 Plateau\". === Relief === M\u0103gura Priei, the highest point of the county The relief is predominantly hilly, mountains occupying a small portion in the south-west. The hilly area is composed of Some\u0219 Plateau and piedmont hills of Silvania. The mountainous area is represented by two northern branches of the Apuseni Mountains: Mese\u0219 with M\u0103gura Priei Peak (996 m) and Plopi\u0219. Depressions are widely distributed throughout the county and represent important agricultural areas of concentration of settlements. === Climate === In terms of climate, S\u0103laj County, by its geographical position, falls in moderate temperate continental climate, west and north-west circulation predominating. The thermal regime of the air is conditioned by altitude, fragmentation and orientation of relief, plus local factors, the average temperature being around 8 \u00b0C. Average temperature at Zal\u0103u (calculated for the period 1961\u20131990) is 9.5 \u00b0C, remarking a growing trend of it. The maximum temperature recorded at the Zal\u0103u meteorological station was 38 \u00b0C on 16 August 1952, and the minimum temperature recorded is -23.5 \u00b0C, on 25 January 1954. The annual rainfall regime is generated by two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. Advection of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus advection of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. The average amount of precipitation is 600\u2013700 mm, in Zal\u0103u being 634.2 mm (calculated for the period 1961\u20131990). The most abundant precipitation falls in summer, when besides frontal processes occurs the intense thermal convection, causing showers, rich in terms of quantity. During the winter, rainfall is less quantitatively, although the number of days with precipitation is not smaller. By and large, the pluviometric maximum overlaps the months of May\u2013June, and the pluviometric minimum is registered in January\u2013February. === Hydrographic network === Some\u0219 at Letca V\u00e2r\u0219ol\u021b Reservoir Hydrographic network of the county has a length of 1,263.7 km, of which the Some\u0219 is 95 km within the county, Alma\u0219 68 km, Agrij 48 km, Crasna 71 km, Barc\u0103u 54 km. Water covers 57.8 km2, representing 1.5% of the county area. === Flora === S\u0103laj landscape presents areas with forests of oak, sessile, beech and other deciduous, pastures and agricultural land planted with vines, fruit trees, grain alternating with anthropogenic landscapes. == Demography == Zal\u0103u, the largest city in S\u0103laj County S\u0103laj County has a population of 224,384 inhabitants (October 2011) and a density of 58 inhabitants/km2.

The eastern half of its territory was in the historical region of Transylvania, while the western half was located in the Cri\u015fana region. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized.
