    "text": "Jake Jon Taylor (born 8 September 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for League Two club Scunthorpe United, on loan from EFL Championship club Nottingham Forest. He played on loan at Port Vale during the 2019\u201320 season. ==Playing career== Taylor was a pupil at Moorside High School in Swinton, Greater Manchester and was associated with Manchester United as a schoolboy until he was not offered a scholarship at Old Trafford at the age of 16. In July 2015 he began a two-year apprenticeship at Nottingham Forest's youth-team. On 30 August 2019, he joined EFL League Two side Port Vale on loan after impressing manager John Askey in training games during a trial spell. Taylor said that \"Port Vale have strong links with Forest, as you have seen with Adam Crookes and also Toby Edser came in. Phil Sproson is good friends with the academy manager Gary Brazil so the link is there. They have shown an interest and I have jumped at it.\" He made his debut the following day, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute for Cristian Monta\u00f1o in a 1\u20130 win over Cambridge United at Vale Park. He later said that \"I knew it would be physical but I think I have dealt with that quite well. Probably the speed of the game has surprised me.\" On 24 September, he scored his first goal in senior football in a 3\u20132 victory at Macclesfield Town in the EFL Trophy. He scored his first league goal four days later, bending the ball into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area in a 3\u20133 draw at Leyton Orient. On 2 November, he scored the only goal of the game at local rivals Crewe Alexandra. He picked up an injury early in January, but nevertheless had his loan spell extended until the end of the 2019\u201320 season. The loan deal was extended after Forest rebuffed two transfer bids from the Vale. However he was unable to add to his tally of seven goals in 25 appearances as the league was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England. On 1 October 2020, Taylor joined League Two club Scunthorpe United on loan for the remainder of the 2020\u201321 season. ==Style of play== Taylor describes himself as a \"ball-playing midfielder\", though can also play at left-back. ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Nottingham Forest |2019\u201320||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2020\u201321||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |Port Vale (loan) |2019\u201320||EFL League Two||18||5||3||0||0||0||4||2||25||7 |- |Scunthorpe United (loan) |2020\u201321||EFL League Two||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !18!!5!!3!!0!!0!!0!!4!!2!!25!!7 |} ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
