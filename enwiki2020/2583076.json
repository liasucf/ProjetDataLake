It is southeast of Perth along the Albany Highway. Kelmscott was one of the very early towns established in the Swan River Colony and was named after Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, the birthplace of the first Anglican clergyman in the colony, Thomas Hobbes Scott (1783\u20131860).http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020389b.htm The suburb of Kelmscott is bisected by the Canning River. On the western side of the river is the flat coastal plain upon which most of Perth is situated. This area includes the Stargate Kelmscott and Kelmscott Village shopping areas along Albany Highway, the light industrial area, the Kelmscott Senior High School and a residential area. To the east, the suburb rises into the western Darling Scarp. Kelmscott celebrated its 175th anniversary on 9 October 2005. The highlight of the celebrations was the running of the Hotham Valley Railway steam locomotive Pm706 from Perth railway station to Kelmscott station, with stops at Cannington, Gosnells, then Armadale station. This was the first running of steam \"under the wires\" on the Transperth network for some time. The event was specially arranged by the Public Transport Authority, whose Minister is also the member of parliament for the local electorate. Kelmscott is home of the first Red Rooster restaurant, as well as Australia's busiest drive-through KFC service. ==Schools== * Kelmscott Primary School (1882) - one of the first primary schools established in Western Australia. * Kelmscott Senior High School (1973) years 7\u201312.damage in 1992. * Clifton Hills Primary School (1972) * Sowilo Community High School (2000) - independent school for young people at educational risk == Annual events == * The Kelmscott Show, run by the Kelmscott Agricultural Society, has been held annually since 1897 (with the exception of the years 1930-1938). == Bushfire 2011 == On 6 February 2011, a declared total fire ban day, a bushfire occurred on private property adjacent to the Brookton Highway in the Roleystone / Kelmscott area.
