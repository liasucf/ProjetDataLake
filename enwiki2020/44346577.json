    "text": "Basic motion of the yo-yo, the handle must be moved rhythmically to maintain the orbits An Eskimo yo-yo or Alaska yo-yo (;Liz Atseriak, Igarta and Brunk, Cara (1998). Yuuyuuk [Eskimo yo-yo]. Lower Kuskokwim School District. ASIN: B01FWT5PY4. ) is a traditional two-balled skill toy played and performed by the Eskimo-speaking Alaska Natives, such as Inupiat, Siberian Yupik, and Yup'ik. It resembles fur-covered bolas and yo-yo. It is regarded as one of the most simple, yet most complex, cultural artifacts/toys in the world.Kiana, Chris (2004/2016). Original 100 Alaska Eskimo Yo-Yo Stratagems: Instructional Book. Publication Consultants. ASIN: B007SNYM38. /. and \"Keynote Speaker: Christopher (Chris) J. Kiana, M.B.A., MA-RD, Ph.D., candidate\", WCSpeakers.com (accessed: December 01 2016). The Eskimo yo-yo involves simultaneously swinging two sealskin balls suspended on caribou sinew strings in opposite directions with one hand. It is popular with Alaskans and tourists alike.Klistoff, Alysa J. (2007), Weapon, Toy, or Art? The Eskimo yo-yo as a commodified Arctic bola and marker of cultural Identity. University of Alaska Fairbanks. . This traditional toy is two unequal lengths of twine, joined together, with hand-made leather objects (balls, bells, hearts) at the ends of the twine.Doogan, Mike (1993). How to Speak Alaskan, . Epicenter. . The object of the Eskimo yo-yo is to make the balls circle in opposite directions at the same time. Each cord is a different length to allow the balls to pass without striking one another,\"Eskimo Bolo \", ToysfromthePast.com. Accessed: November 29, 2016.Morrow, Phyllis (1987). Making the best of two worlds: an anthropological approach to the development of bilingual education materials in southwestern Alaska, p.206, n.1. Cornell. and the balls are powered by centripetal force (as they rise the performer pumps down, while they fall the performer pumps up).Walton, Sandra J. \"An Inuit yo-yo\", Science Experiments on File (FOFWeb.com/onfiles/SEOF), p.2. This basic trick may be referred to as the \"Eskimo orbit\", and the orbit may be performed vertically, horizontally, or (horizontally) above one's head.Kiana, Chris. Other tricks or patterns include atypical beginnings and wrapping and/or bouncing the strings around a part of one's body and then continuing with the orbit. A three-ball version of the Eskimo yo-yo also exist, and this requires all three balls to be moving at the same time. The objects at the end of the string are made in a variety of shapes, ranging from seals, ptarmigan feet and dolls, to miniature mukluks and simple balls. The handle may be wood, bone, or ivory, as well as baleen. Many are plainly decorated; others display elaborate decorations, fine beadwork, and intricate details. The Eskimo yo-yo is bola, toy, and art form all rolled into one. One of their most popular forms of the Alaska Native art are yo-yos. Also, this is a popular tourist art found in gift shops across Alaska. Some shops carry only Native-made pieces, while others, according to Alysa Klistoff, carry imitation pieces made in China. See: Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. Much like the spinning top (e.g. Maxwell's top), the yo-yo may also be used to demonstrate visual properties such as optical rotationGill, S. J. (1961), \"A demonstration of optical rotation with an \"Eskimo yo-yo\"\". Journal of Chemical Education 38 (5): 263. and circular dichroism.Meloan, Clifton E. and Gere, Dennis (1977), \"The use of an Eskimo yo-yo to demonstrate circular dichroism and optical rotation\". Journal of Chemical Education 54 (9): 577. Though the early history of the Eskimo yo-yo is not recorded, Eskimos maintain that this game originated as an important and widely used hunting tool made simply with sinew and bones, the bola.\"Juanita Tukrook\", CommunityCelebration.org. (\"First Nation Inupiak elder. Born in Fairbanks, Alaska in a small village called Tanana along the Arctic slope.\"): \"Even when we catch ducks, we use this for a feather duster or you know something in the house. We try to use all parts of the animal. This is um...made from seal and this is called ah...Alaskan yo-yo, Eskimo yo-yo. And this is how you work it. But this is some of the toys I played with growing up.\" Accessed November 29, 2061.Donachy, Jack & Barbra (October 8, 2013. \"Inupiat (Eskimo) Yo-Yo with Polar Bear Fur\", CutterLight.com.
