    "text": "Ekota Express (Train no. 705-706) is an inter-city train service of Bangladesh, running between Kamalapur Railway Station of Dhaka and Panchagarh Railway Station (B.M.S.E.) of Panchagarh, operated by Bangladesh Railway. == History == In 1986, a train named Ekota Express was started between Dinajpur and Dhaka. As Jamuna Bridge did no exist on that time, passengers can go from Dinajpur up to Balashi Ghat. There, they had to cross Jamuna river by ferry, and on the other side of the river, another rake of Ekota Express started up to Dhaka. Since the introduction of Jamuna Bridge, Ekota Express runs on a single rake. On September 2, 2016, Ekota Express along with Drutojan Express were converted from meter-gauge to broad-gauge. Ekota Express has a load of 13/26 and can hold up to 1,200 passengers. == Timetable == (The timetable of Bangladesh Railway is changed over the time.
