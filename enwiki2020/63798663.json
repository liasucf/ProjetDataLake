From 1863 onwards she spent time in Valentia Island, County Kerry, where her father managed a local slate quarry. She was encouraged by Edward William Cooke, a marine and landscape artist, to focus on local flora. Her work is likened to Diana Conyngham Ellis in style. Lecky exhibited with the Royal Hibernian Academy four times with flower painting between 1880 and 1886. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew hold three drawings by Lecky, presented by her brother John after her death.
