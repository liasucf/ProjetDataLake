    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Alberto Rodr\u00edguez Chucuan (born May 25, 1977) is a Mexican-American professional wrestler, professional wrestling promoter, and mixed martial artist. He is best known for his time in WWE under the ring name Alberto Del Rio, and Impact Wrestling under the ring name Alberto El Patron. Before working for WWE, Rodr\u00edguez used the name Dos Caras Jr. as both a mixed martial artist and luchador in mostly Mexico and Japan, achieving success in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) by winning the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship once. Rodr\u00edguez signed with WWE in 2009 and made his debut on their main roster the following year as Alberto Del Rio. In WWE, he became the first Mexico-born world champion in WWE history after he won the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship twice each. He also won the 2011 Royal Rumble and the 2011 Money in the Bank ladder match, making him the only professional wrestler to win both in the same calendar year. Rodr\u00edguez departed WWE in 2014 and wrestled as Alberto El Patr\u00f3n in other promotions such as Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), Ring of Honor (ROH), Lucha Underground, Japanese and Puerto Rican promotions, and various United States independent promotions. In AAA, he won the AAA Mega Championship once. He returned to WWE in 2015, winning the United States Championship twice, before departing again in 2016. He subsequently signed with Impact Wrestling and won the Impact World Championship title at Slammiversary XV. In professional wrestling he is the only man in history to have been WWE, (WWE) World Heavyweight, Impact World, GFW Global, AAA Mega and CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. He is overall a nine-time world champion. == Family and early life== Born in San Luis Potos\u00ed into one of the most well known Mexican wrestling families, his father is noted luchador Dos Caras, while his uncles are Mil M\u00e1scaras and Sicodelico. His cousins, Sicodelico Jr. and Hijo de Sicodelico, are also wrestlers. His younger brother Guillermo signed a WWE contract in August 2012 and was assigned to the promotion's developmental territory NXT under the ring name Memo Montenegro, but was released in July 2013. Rodr\u00edguez graduated from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed where he earned a degree in architecture. == Amateur wrestling == Growing up in a family of wrestlers Rodr\u00edguez decided to take up Greco-Roman wrestling, training under Leonel Kolesni and Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. He earned a place on the Mexico national team in Greco-Roman wrestling and while competing on the national team obtained several accomplishments. In 1997, he placed third at the World Junior Championships, in the Czech Republic. He also won the Central American and Caribbean Games in his weight division three times and won a medal at the Pan American Games. Rodr\u00edguez was on track to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but due to a lack of funding and support, Mexico did not send a wrestling team that year. == Professional wrestling career == === AAA (2000\u20132002) === After not competing at the 2000 Olympic games, Rodr\u00edguez turned to the family business, and trained with his father to become a professional wrestler. He made his debut appearance on May 9, 2000 as Dos Caras Jr. when he ran in during an AAA show to save his father from a beat down from El Texano and Pirata Morgan. Over the next couple of years, Caras worked both in Mexico and Japan to gain experience in the ring. In Mexico he worked exclusively for AAA making appearances at shows such as the 2002 Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo, where he teamed with El Gronda and El Hijo del Solitario to defeat the trio of Pirata Morgan, Sangre Chicana and El Brazo. === Japanese promotions (2001\u20132004) === Rodr\u00edguez's first foray into puroresu was in 2001 for the Battlarts promotion, where he defeated Kazunari Murakami at the YUKI- BOM-BA-YE event. Rodr\u00edguez returned to Japan the following year wrestling for Pro Wrestling Zero1 (Zero1) and All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). After wrestling for Zero1 primarily throughout 2002 and 2003, Rodr\u00edguez joined Hustle, debuting on their inaugural Hustle 1 event. He would continue to wrestle for Hustle under the ring names Dos Caras Jr. and Hustle Kamen Gold until October 2004. === Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2005\u20132009) === In 2005, Caras was signed to a contract with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). In his first test in the company, Caras competed in the 2005 La Copa Junior, but the storyline of the tournament saw him defeated in the semi-final by Dr. Wagner Jr. Caras's advancement to the semi-final of the cup, mere months after signing with the company was an indicator that the bookers were interested in elevating him up the rankings, this was further supported when he received matches for both the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship and the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship inside a three-week period. The following year on March 31, 2006 Caras was entered again into the La Copa Junior tournament and earned a return victory over Dr. Wagner Jr. who knocked him out of the tournament the previous year. He also won against Heavy Metal and Apolo Dant\u00e9s to gain a place in the final, defeating H\u00e9ctor Garza to win the prize. While working in Japan, Caras had taken to teaming with another second-generation wrestler, Lizmark Jr., and when both found themselves in CMLL they were teamed up once again with the team's famous fathers being the selling point. Over the next year Caras found himself without much direction, he worked storylines with \u00daltimo Guerrero and Kenzo Suzuki but nothing long term came of it. Caras received two opportunities to challenge Universo 2000 for the CMLL World Heavyweight title but came up short until his third attempt on July 8, 2007 when he became the CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. While in wrestling promotions outside of Mexico the Heavyweight title would indicate that he was the top man in the federation, Mexican wrestling promotions tend to put more emphasis on the lower weight divisions over the heavyweights. After the contract dealings with WWE surfaced he began showing signs of becoming a rudo (villain). He turned his attention away from the matches and instead try to win the approval of the fans, often costing his team the match because he was distracted. Caras himself explained this behavior by stating that he \"hurt his shoulder, but bravely stayed in the arena\". After hinting at a change for weeks Caras finally cemented his villainous persona on April 11, 2009, the second member of the Rodr\u00edguez family to be a heel (after his uncle, El Sicod\u00e9lico Sr). Caras's run with the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship remained largely uneventful with only four title defenses in the 533 days that he held the championship, before losing it and departing for WWE. === World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE (2009 - 2014)=== ==== Contract negotiations (2008\u20132009) ==== By the fall of 2008, a story broke that Rodr\u00edguez had wrestled a dark match for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and that they had offered him a contract. Over the following months conflicting reports of whether he had signed or not arose, but he remained CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. When he lost the title to \u00daltimo Guerrero it was believed that he had indeed signed with WWE, with him being rumored to be a surprise participant in the 2009 Royal Rumble. However, he remained with CMLL and stated that he signed a four-year deal and chose CMLL because they offered him a better deal than WWE. ==== Florida Championship Wrestling (2009\u20132010) ==== On June 17, 2009, Rodr\u00edguez confirmed that he had signed a three-year contract with WWE, stating that he would not have to go to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, but directly to the main roster. Furthermore, he would retain the rights to his name, mask and image, but allow the WWE to use it for promotional purposes while he is under contract with them. He agreed to the contract since it addressed the main reasons why he turned down the WWE's offer in January 2009. Despite his claims, he had a match with Kris Logan at FCW under the name Dos. He later also went on to wrestle under the ring names Dorado and El Dorado. During a segment on the Abraham Washington show at the August 6 taping, Rodr\u00edguez revealed a new, unmasked wrestling character named Alberto Banderas. When he revealed his face, he was criticized by some Mexicans for revealing, to which he responded that only a few people know why he lost the mask in that way. During WWE's WrestleMania Revenge tour of Europe in April 2010, he made numerous appearances in untelevised matches for the Raw brand. One night he wrestled as Dos Caras, but he did not wear his mask. He was presented as a villain in a losing effort against Christian. The following month Caras put his mask back on for WWE's tour of Mexico and worked as a hometown hero, prior to returning unmasked during untelevised matches for subsequent Raw and SmackDown shows. Later, Rodr\u00edguez said that he hated his time in FCW, but that he learned a lot. ==== Early feuds (2010\u20132011) ==== Tribute to the Troops event On the June 25, 2010, episode of SmackDown, Rodr\u00edguez appeared on a taped promotional video as the unmasked Alberto Del Rio. Thereafter, a vignette aired every week on SmackDown promoting his character as an arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat, espousing his own virtues of honesty, integrity and mental faculties. After two months, Del Rio wrestled his first match at a house show in Brisbane, Australia and a week later, he made his television debut on the August 20 episode of SmackDown by defeating Rey Mysterio in the main event by submission with the cross armbreaker. As part of his act, Del Rio made his entrances in an expensive car, while he was introduced by his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez. The following week, Del Rio continued the storyline with Mysterio by attacking him after his match with Kane, giving him a storyline injury by refusing to relinquish his armbar. Two weeks later, he defeated Matt Hardy via submission in Hardy's last appearance with the company causing Hardy's friend Christian to challenge Del Rio to a match at Night of Champions. Despite declining the match, on the September 24 episode of SmackDown Del Rio attacked Christian and injured him the same way he did Mysterio the previous month. This was done to write Christian off television, as he had suffered a torn pectoral muscle. Mysterio returned on the October 8 episode of SmackDown, and handed Del Rio his first defeat in the main event match. In October, Del Rio defeated Chris Masters to represent the SmackDown brand at Bragging Rights, but during the pay-per-view event, he attacked teammate Rey Mysterio, before being eliminated from the match by Team Raw's CM Punk. At Survivor Series, in the traditional five-on-five elimination match, Del Rio captained a team against Rey Mysterio's team. Despite Del Rio's team losing, he was removed from the match after Big Show knocked him out with a WMD. On the November 26 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Big Show via countout to qualify for the 2010 King of the Ring tournament. In the tournament the next week on Raw, he made United States Champion Daniel Bryan submit in the first round, but was defeated by John Morrison in the semifinal after being distracted by Mysterio who was inside his car. At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Del Rio competed in a fatal four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Edge and also included Kane and Rey Mysterio. On the January 7, 2011 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Mysterio in a two-out-of-three-falls match, with help from Ricardo Rodriguez by holding Mysterio out of the ring to end his long feud with Mysterio. On the fourth season of NXT, starting in December 2010, Del Rio mentored rookie Conor O'Brian, who became the second contestant to be eliminated from the competition on January 18. The following week the rookies competed in a fatal-four-way match, of which the winner could change their pro. Brodus Clay won the match and chose Del Rio as his new pro. After the conclusion of NXT, Del Rio hired Clay as his bodyguard. On January 30, 2011, Del Rio defeated 39 other participants, last eliminating Santino Marella, to win the 2011 Royal Rumble and earn the right to compete for either the World Heavyweight Championship or the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXVII. The next night on Raw, Del Rio chose to compete for Edge's World Heavyweight Championship. At Elimination Chamber, Del Rio attacked Edge, after he had successfully defended his title and solidified his spot as Del Rio's opponent at WrestleMania. However, Edge managed to come out the exchange victorious, after Christian returned from his injury and attacked Del Rio. On the March 18 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio and Christian finally had their first one\u2013on\u2013one match in a steel cage, in which Christian won. At WrestleMania XXVII, Del Rio was unsuccessful in his World Heavyweight Title match against Edge. On the April 8 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Christian to earn a rematch against Edge at Extreme Rules. However, when Edge unexpectedly retired from professional wrestling on the April 11 episode of Raw, Del Rio was instead booked to face Christian in a ladder match for the vacant World Heavyweight Title. ==== WWE Champion (2011\u20132012) ==== WWE Champion in 2011 On the April 25 episode of Raw, Del Rio was drafted from SmackDown to Raw. Ricardo Rodriguez moved to Raw with him, while Brodus Clay remained on SmackDown. On May 1 at Extreme Rules, Del Rio lost to Christian in a ladder match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 23 episode of Raw, Del Rio slapped Big Show after he had gotten into a confrontation with Ricardo Rodriguez. After competing in a match, Show was run over by Del Rio's car, driven by Rodriguez, leaving him sidelined with a storyline knee injury. Show made his return three weeks later, chasing Del Rio out of the ring and beating Rodriguez down. On June 19 at Capitol Punishment, Del Rio defeated Show via referee stoppage, when he was unable to continue the match due to a pre-match assault by Mark Henry. On the June 27 episode of Raw, Del Rio defeated Show in a steel cage match, again after interference from Henry. On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Del Rio defeated Alex Riley, Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Kofi Kingston, The Miz, R-Truth and Rey Mysterio in the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match for a future WWE Championship match whenever and wherever over the next year, while also becoming the first wrestler in history to win a Royal Rumble and a Money in the Bank match in the same year. Following the orders of Vince McMahon, Del Rio attempted to cash in his contract later that same night on CM Punk, who had just defeated John Cena for the WWE Championship, but was attacked and laid out by Punk before he could do so. Del Rio eventually cashed in his contract on August 14 at SummerSlam, challenging CM Punk after the main event, where he had defeated John Cena to become the undisputed WWE Champion. Between the two matches, Punk was attacked by Kevin Nash, which led to Del Rio scoring a quick pinfall victory to win the WWE Championship for the first time. In winning the title, Del Rio became the first ever Mexican-born WWE Champion. Del Rio made his first televised title defense the next night on Raw, defeating Rey Mysterio to retain his title. On September 18 at Night of Champions, Del Rio lost the championship to John Cena, but gained it back on October 2 at Hell in a Cell by defeating Cena and Punk in a Hell in a Cell match.

On November 20 at Survivor Series, Del Rio lost the WWE Championship to Punk. Del Rio received a WWE championship rematch on the November 28 episode of Raw, but lost after Punk dropped him onto an exposed turnbuckle, managing to avoid a disqualification, which would have cost him the title in the process. On December 18 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Del Rio failed again to regain the WWE Title from Punk in a triple threat Tables, Ladders and Chairs match, also involving The Miz. The next night on Raw, Del Rio suffered a torn groin muscle, which required surgery and sidelined him for four to six weeks. ==== World Heavyweight Champion (2012\u20132013) ==== Del Rio in 2012 Del Rio returned at a WWE house show in San Francisco on February 11, 2012, arm wrestling Sheamus to a no contest.

On the May 25 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Kane and Orton in a triple threat match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. The next week on SmackDown, Del Rio suffered a legitimate concussion, which led to WWE pulling him from his scheduled World Heavyweight Championship match against Sheamus at No Way Out. Del Rio returned on the June 18 episode of Raw, defeating United States Champion Santino Marella in a non-title match. The next week on Raw, Del Rio wrestled Dolph Ziggler to a no contest in a Contract on a Pole match for a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship.

On the July 27 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Daniel Bryan, Kane, and Mysterio in a fatal four-way match to again become number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The title match, originally set for SummerSlam, was moved to the August 10 episode of SmackDown, after Del Rio threatened to press charges against Sheamus for stealing his car on the August 6 episode of Raw, which would have prevented Sheamus from appearing at Summerslam. However, before the match began, Del Rio attacked Sheamus along with men posing as police officers, which led to SmackDown General Manager Booker T taking away his number one contender's status in result. However, the next week, Sheamus had the title match put back on for SummerSlam on August 19, where Del Rio again failed in attempt to dethrone Sheamus after the referee didn't notice Del Rio's foot on the bottom rope. On the August 24 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Randy Orton by submission to once again become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. On the September 7 SmackDown, Del Rio filed assault charges against Sheamus, after Sheamus had attacked him and Rodriguez on the September 3 episode Raw, which led to Booker T banning the Brogue Kick with the caveat that Sheamus would be stripped of the World Heavyweight Championship if he used the move again. However, on September 16 at Night of Champions, Booker T concluded his investigation into the dangers of the move and lifted the ban. In the match that followed, Sheamus used the Brogue Kick to defeat Del Rio and retain the World Heavyweight title. With his rivalry with Sheamus behind him, Del Rio moved on to feuding with Randy Orton, with the two attacking each other on the September 28 episode of SmackDown. The rivalry built to a singles match on October 28 at Hell in a Cell, where Orton emerged victorious.

After repeated attacks from Show to both himself and Rodriguez, Del Rio and Show faced off in a singles match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, where Del Rio submitted him to the cross armbreaker to retain his title. Del Rio then began a feud with his new number one contender, Jack Swagger, over his opposing political views regarding immigration in America. The feud escalated on the March 18 episode of Raw, when Swagger broke Rodriguez's ankle with his Patriot Lock submission. Del Rio continued feuding with Swagger on the April 1 episode of Raw, defeating Swagger's manager Zeb Colter via disqualification after Colter hit Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez's crutch.

After the loss of the World Heavyweight Title, Del Rio would continue feud with Swagger and Ziggler over the title. On the April 29 episode of Raw, Ricardo Rodriguez defeated Big E Langston and Zeb Colter in a three-way match to give Del Rio the right to choose the stipulation of his three-way match at Extreme Rules and chose a ladder match. However, Ziggler would suffer a legitimate concussion at a SmackDown taping, thus removing their match from Extreme Rules. In result of Ziggler's injury, Del Rio instead would be booked to face Swagger in a number one contender \"I Quit\" match at the pay-per-view on May 19, which Del Rio won. In the following weeks, Del Rio would face Ziggler's enforcer Big E. Langston in a series of matches, which Del Rio won 3-2. Del Rio finally received his title shot on June 16 at Payback, and during the match, a double-turn occurred; Del Rio turned heel once again by repeatedly and ruthlessly targeting Ziggler's head after his recent concussion to defeat Ziggler and regain the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio later explained that he targeted Ziggler's head the same way Ziggler targeted Del Rio's injured leg when Ziggler cashed in Money in the Bank to win the title from Del Rio.

On the January 13 episode of Raw, he defeated Rey Mysterio and after the match, once again confronted Batista. On the January 20 episode of Raw, after he defeated Rey Mysterio, Batista returned and attacked Del Rio with a Batista Bomb. Six days later at the Royal Rumble, Del Rio entered the Rumble match at number 27 and performed well, but was eliminated by Batista who went on to win the match. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Del Rio confronted and ultimately assaulted Batista, which led to Batista powerbombing Del Rio through the broadcast table the following week. Before that, Del Rio squashed Dolph Ziggler. This led to a match between Del Rio and Batista at Elimination Chamber, which Batista won. The following night on Raw, Del Rio defeated Batista in a rematch from the previous night. At WrestleMania XXX, Alberto Del Rio participated in the Andre the Giant memorial battle royal and made a number of eliminations before being eliminated by Sheamus.

Del Rio lost several matches over the following weeks and was fired from WWE on August 7, due to \"unprofessional conduct\" following an altercation with an employee who allegedly made a racist joke. === Return to AAA (2014\u20132015, 2018) === On August 11, 2014, AAA announced that after bring fired by WWE, Rodr\u00edguez would be returning to the promotion at Tripleman\u00eda XXII. In a press conference on August 14, Rodr\u00edguez acknowledged that WWE owned the Alberto Del Rio name and also revealed that he would be working for AAA under the new ring name El Patr\u00f3n (\"The Boss\"). He was nicknamed this in WWE by Ricardo Rodriguez, during ring introductions and Spanish commentary, but it was not trademarked. Rodr\u00edguez also stated that for the moment he was under a 90-day no-compete clause, which would prevent him from wrestling for AAA. He later also revealed that as part of his departure from WWE, Del Rio was banned from wrestling in the United States for one year. On August 17 at Tripleman\u00eda XXII, El Patr\u00f3n and his father Dos Caras appeared to open the show, speaking on coming to AAA and addressing WWE, claiming that the company was racist. They were interrupted by the Los Perros del Mal stable. After one of the members laid his hands on Caras, El Patr\u00f3n ran after the stable and cleared house, while officials reminded him that he has the no- compete clause from the WWE. The show ended with El Patr\u00f3n attacking Los Perros del Mal leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, after his win in the main event. In early September 2014, Rodr\u00edguez's lawyers had resolved his issues with WWE and he was no longer restricted by the 90-day no-compete clause. On September 14, Rodr\u00edguez, now billed as \"El Patr\u00f3n Alberto\", made his AAA in- ring return teaming with Myzteziz and La Parka in a six-man tag team main event, where they defeated Aguayo, Averno and El Texano Jr. Alberto then began feuding with El Texano Jr. over the AAA Mega Championship. On November 28, Ricardo Rodriguez made his AAA debut, once again becoming Alberto's personal ring announcer. On December 7 at Guerra de Titanes, Alberto defeated El Texano Jr. to become the new AAA Mega Champion. With the win, Rodr\u00edguez became the first wrestler to have held both the CMLL and AAA world heavyweight championships. On May 24, 2015, Alberto came together with Myzteziz and Rey Mysterio Jr. to form the \"Dream Team\" for AAA's Lucha Libre World Cup. The trio eventually won the tournament, defeating Johnny Mundo, Matt Hardy and Mr. Anderson in the finals. At Tripleman\u00eda XXIII, El Patr\u00f3n defeated Brian Cage in a Hair vs. Hair Lucha de Apuestas. At H\u00e9roes Inmortales IX, El Patr\u00f3n retained the Mega Championship against Johnny Mundo. After Rodr\u00edguez returned to WWE and it became clear that he would not return to AAA to defend the Mega Championship and was therefore stripped of the title on November 9. WWE had allowed him to participate at Guerra de Titanes but when the event was canceled, WWE rescinded the offer. In 2018, it was announces El Patr\u00f3n would make his return at Tripleman\u00eda XXVI, facing a mysterious opponent. However, during a press conference on August 21, AAA did not mention El Patr\u00f3n's match as part of the final card. El Patr\u00f3n explained he would not appear since he had a discussion with Dorian Rold\u00e1n over the money and they did not find an opponent form him. Rold\u00e1n said that Alberto had no communication with the promotion, so they did not include him in the final card. === World Wrestling Council (2014\u20132015, 2016\u20132017) === On August 24, 2014, the World Wrestling Council began a storyline by airing a backstage segment where heel manager Juan Manuel Ortega talked by telephone with someone only identified as \"patr\u00f3n\" and referenced a reunion previously held at WrestleMania XXX. The following week featured a segment where the manager picked Ricardo Rodriguez from Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport and drove to a golf club where Ray Gonz\u00e1lez Sr. (who had been feuding with several of Ortega's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s) was playing a round.

The following day, Ray Gonz\u00e1lez Sr. challenged El Patr\u00f3n to a match.
