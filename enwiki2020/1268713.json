After Jeong's capture, 29th Regiment of the 9th Division, along with the 1st and 3rd Airborne Brigades, invaded downtown Seoul to support the 30th and 33rd Capital Security Group loyal to Chun, then a series of conflicts broke out in the capital. Two of Jeong's allies, Major General Jang Tae-wan (Capital Security commander) and Major General Jeong Byeong Ju (special forces commander), were also arrested by the rebel troops. Major Kim Oh-rang, Aide-de-camp of Jeong Byeong Ju, was killed during the gun-fight. By the next morning, the Ministry of Defense and Army HQ were all occupied. Chun and his fellow 11th class of Korea Military Academy graduates, such as Major General Roh Tae-woo, commanding general of 9th Infantry Division, and Major General Jeong Ho-yong, were in charge of the Korean military. Chun was supported in the coup and the subsequent consolidation of power by the powerful private club of military officials called Hanahoe. The Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth and the Coup d'\u00e9tat of May Seventeenth ended the Fourth Republic of South Korea and led to the Fifth Republic of South Korea. ==See also== * Coup d'\u00e9tat of May Seventeenth * Gwangju Democratic Uprising * History of South Korea * List of Korea-related topics ==Further reading== *Don Oberdorfer, The Two Koreas (Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass, 1997, , p. 121) *Young, James V.
