This is achieved through legal research and publication projects, the administration of post-graduate and professional training programs, and the operation of continuing legal education conferences each year. More than 5,000 lawyers worldwide have been designated as Honorary Fellows of the Center for International Legal Studies in recognition of their contributions to the Center's publications and conferences. Nearly 500 Honorary Fellows have taken membership in the Congress of Fellows. CILS established the International Business Law Consortium (IBLC) in 1996 as a means of assisting law firms affiliated with the Center to participate in and further its programs, and to translate these benefits to the delivery of transnational legal services. == References == == External links == * Center for International Legal Studies * Central Registry of Public Interest Societies, Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior Category:Non-profit organisations based in Austria ",
