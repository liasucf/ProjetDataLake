    "text": "The PlayStation Analog Joystick (SCPH-1110) is Sony's first analog controller for the PlayStation, and is the precursor to the PlayStation Dual Analog Controller. It is often incorrectly referred to as the \"Sony Flightstick\" (not to be confused with the Flightstick line of joysticks for PlayStation consoles by third-party peripheral manufacturer Hori). ==History== Announced to the public in August 1995, Gamezero.com the Analog Joystick was released to the public in Japan in early April 1996. Maru-Chang.com ==Features== The Analog Joystick used potentiometer technology previously used on consoles such as the Vectrex; instead of relying on binary eight-way switches, the controller can detect minute angular changes through the entire range of motion. The stick also features a thumb-operated digital hat switch on the right joystick, corresponding to the traditional D-pad, and used for instances when simple digital movements were necessary. A compatibility mode for the Analog Joystick was included in the Dual Analog Controller, Sony's first analog revision of its original gamepad design. PS1 games that support the PS1 Analog Joystick have an \"Analog Joystick Compatible\" icon on the back cover. The Analog Joystick has a switch to select either Analog or Digital mode. When in the Digital mode, both sticks function as the gamepad on a regular PS1 controller. Older PS1 games that do not support the PS1 DualShock sticks can work with the Analog Joystick. ==List of games with Analog Joystick support== PlayStation * Ace Combat 2 * Ace Combat 3 * Ape Escape * Armored Trooper Votoms (Japan) * Asteroids * Atari Anniversary Edition Redux *Atari Collection 2 (Paperboy, RoadBlasters, Marble Madness) * Bogey Dead 6 (Japan as Sidewinder / Europe as Raging Skies), released at the same time as the Analog Joystick Playstation Perfect Guide glossary * Centipede *Car & Driver Grand Tour Racing '98 * Choro Q Jet: Rainbow Wings (Japan) * Colony Wars * Colony Wars: Vengeance * Cyberia * Descent and Descent Maximum *Digital Glider Airman (Japan) * Elemental Gearbolt *EOS: Edge of Skyhigh (Japan) * Formula 1 97 (known as Formula 1 Championship Edition in United States and Canada) * Galaxian 3 (Japan & Europe) * Gunship * Independence Day * Macross Digital Mission VF-X (Japan) * Macross Digital Mission VF-X 2 (Japan) * MDK * MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat * Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2 (used in Blaster) * Missile Command * Namco Museum Vol. 4 (Assault and Assault Plus only) * Newman / Haas Racing * Nightmare Creatures * Pitfall 3D: Beyond the Jungle * Project Gaiairy (Japan) * Rise 2: Resurrection * R/C Stunt Copter * Shadow Master * Sidewinder 2 Box Shot of Flightstick Logo *Slamscape * Steel Reign * The Need for Speed (supports digital mode only) * Treasures of the Deep * Vehicle Cavalier (Japan) * Vigilante 8 * Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom * Wing Over 2 Box Shot of Flightstick Logo Box Shot of Flightstick Logo * Zero Pilot (Japan) PlayStation 2 * R-Type Final (Both Analog and Digital mode) * XG3: Extreme G Racing (Both Analog and Digital Mode) There are other PS2 games that also can use the PS1 Analog Joystick, but only in Digital Mode.

The PlayStation Analog Joystick did not sell well in Japan, reportedly due to its high cost and bulky size. == Other == The Analog Joystick can be connected to the PC via a USB adapter and also via a DirectPad Pro style parallel port interface Allegro library source (psxpad.c) which can be accessed under Windows using the DirectPad Aldo's Tools or other drivers.
