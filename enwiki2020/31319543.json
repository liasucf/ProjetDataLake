Rubus pedatus is a low shrub or herb with thorn-less creeping stems. The leaves are alternate, deciduous, divided into 5 leaflets (hence the name) each coarsely toothed. The flowers are white, across, and occur singly on slender stalks. The fruits are bright red, and consist of small clusters of drupelets, sometimes as few as one drupelet per fruit. The fruits are edible.Flora of North America, Rubus pedatus Smith, 1791. Strawberryleaf raspberry Pojar, Jim and MacKinnon, Andy. Plants of Coastal British Columbia. Lone Pine Publishing. 1994.
