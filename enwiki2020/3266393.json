Timarete () (or Thamyris, Tamaris, Thamar; 5th century BC), was an ancient Greek painter. She was the daughter of the painter Micon the Younger of Athens. According to Pliny the Elder, she \"scorned the duties of women and practised her father's art.\" At the time of Archelaus I of Macedon she was best known for a panel painting of the goddess of Diana that was kept at Ephesus. Ephesus had a particular reverence for the goddess Diana. While it is no longer extant, it was kept at Ephesus for many years.
