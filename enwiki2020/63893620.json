    "text": "\"Winter Song\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Chris Rea, released in 1991 as an extended play and as a track on the European edition of his eleventh studio album Auberge. \"Winter Song\" was written by Rea and produced by Jon Kelly. The EP, which was released to coincide with Rea's current tour of Britain, reached No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart and remained in the Top 100 for four weeks. ==Critical reception== On its release, Music & Media wrote: \"Rea has a good sense of the seasons. His last single was called \"Looking for the Summer\", and now he reclaims his spot around the fireplace with this pleasant Dire Straits-like folk song.\" Jim Lawn of the Lennox Herald commented: \"This single will certainly provide Rea with another hit. As winter and Christmas close in on us this single should fit the mood of the season.\" Peter Kinghorn of the Evening Chronicle described the song as a \"superb\" and \"expressive\" ballad. ==Track listing== 7\" single (UK) # \"Winter Song\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Footprints in the Snow\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:04 7\" single (Germany and France) # \"Winter Song\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Footprints in the Snow\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Set Me Free\" \u2013 5:38 CD single (UK and Europe) # \"Winter Song\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Footprints in the Snow\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Tell Me There's a Heaven\" \u2013 6:04 # \"True to You\" \u2013 3:58 CD single (Germany) # \"Winter Song\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Footprints in the Snow\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Set Me Free\" \u2013 5:38 # \"True to You\" \u2013 3:58 ==Personnel== Winter Song * Chris Rea - guitar, slide guitar, Hammond organ * Max Middleton - keyboards * Robert Ahwai - bass * Martin Ditcham - drums, percussion Production * Jon Kelly - producer (all tracks) * Chris Rea - producer (\"Tell Me There's a Heaven\") * Justin Shirley-Smith - engineer (\"Winter Song\") * Russell Shaw - additional engineer (\"Winter Song\") Other * Stephen Sandon - individual photography * Simon Fowler - background photography * Stylorouge - design ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1991) !Peak position |- | Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|30 |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|27 |} ==References== Category:1991 songs Category:1991 EPs Category:East West Records EPs Category:Songs written by Chris Rea Category:Chris Rea songs ",
