    "text": "Dale Deppe is an American horticulture industry innovator of proprietary woody plants. Deppe has received numerous awards in various organizations within the woody plant industry. Dale and Liz Deppe - 2019 Dale and his wife Liz Deppe founded Spring Meadow Nursery in 1981. Spring Meadow Nursery is located in Grand Haven, Michigan US and is one of the largest providers of \"proprietary\" plant materials in North America In 2004, Spring Meadow joined with Proven Winners as their exclusive woody plant licensee to select, develop, distribute, and market Proven Winners ColorChoice Shrubs. == Early life == Dale Deppe's ancestors were Dutch and immigrated to West Michigan. The Dutch established a rich tradition for horticulture. Deppe got his start working with plants by picking onions. He found out about a job at Arthur L. Watson Nursery and started working there at age 14. Jim, a local botany teacher, worked at the nursery and mentored Deppe and two of his friends. \u201cHe took me and my friends under his wing and treated us as students,\u201d Dale Deppe said in an interview with Green House Management Magazine. \u201cJim loved plants and he just couldn\u2019t stop himself from being a teacher. He was passionate about the nursery business and he passed it on to us.\u201d He pursued that interest further and graduated with a horticulture degree from Michigan State University in 1971. == Spring Meadow Nursery == After graduating from Michigan State, he worked as a contractor for Zelenka Nurseries in Grand Haven. In those days, Zelenka was a large nursery. Deppe farmed a 20-acre tract he owned. He took retail-ready shrubs and potted them and shipped them to Zelenka\u2019s dock. He said to Green House Management Magazine, \u201cI was an energetic young man, working night and day on both jobs and the market was good,\u201d he says. \u201cI built a house on the 20 acres, brought my first crop to Zelenka and bought another 40 acres down the road thinking I\u2019d do more contract growing.\u201d He worked with Zelenka for 11 years. He bought forty additional acres. Three months after closing on those forty acres, Zelenka discontinued their arrangement and Deppe had to move on to something else. They sold the forty acres, Liz got a job and Deppe began selling plants. Spring Meadow Nursery was born. The year was 1981. == Contributions to the woody plant industry == Since the 1980s, Deppe played a role in developing and marketing a business model for proprietary woody plants. Before that time, few plants were developed for their hardy genetics. He prioritized the hunting of woody plants with excellent genetics. He hired a horticulturist, plant breeder and plant hunter named Tim Wood to travel around the globe to find excellent plants. Jeremy Deppe, his son (General Manager of Spring Meadow) was quoted in Green House Management magazine as saying, \u201cDale was instrumental in driving the push into branding as a way to differentiate from commodities,\u201d Jeremy says. \u201cBranding has provided a way for each part of the supply chain to add value and introducing new varieties has made gardening easier for consumers.\u201d Green House Magazine interviewed Deppe on what he thought his contributions to the Woody Plant Industry entailed. He focused on how the new business plan for woody plants (shrubs, vines and trees) allowed for branding and marketing for better customer service. == Breast cancer research == Dale Deppe made Spring Meadow the vehicle to raise over one million dollars for breast cancer research to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and BCRF-funded investigators who have been deeply involved in every major advance in breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship. == Personal life == Dale Deppe is married to Liz Deppe and they have a son, Jeremy working in their business as the General Manager. == Horticulture awards == === MNLA Grower of the Year - 1995 === Presented by the Michigan Nursery and Landscape Association (MNLA).
