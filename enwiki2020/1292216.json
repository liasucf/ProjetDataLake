Zolt\u00e1n Tildy was born in Losonc (Lu\u010denec now in Slovakia), in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the family of a Hungarian official in the local government. He took a degree in theology from the Reformed Theological Academy in P\u00e1pa, afterwards spending a year studying at Assembly's College, Belfast, in Ireland. Tildy served as an active minister of the Reformed Church beginning in 1921, and edited the daily paper of the Reformed church in Hungary, the Kereszt\u00e9ny Csal\u00e1d (Christian Family), as well as other periodicals. In 1929, Tildy joined the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKgP) with other noted Hungarian political figures, including Ferenc Nagy. He became executive vice-president of the organization soon afterwards. He married Erzs\u00e9bet Gyenis (1896\u20131985) in 1916 and had three children: Zolt\u00e1n Tildy, Jr. (1917\u20131994), Erzs\u00e9bet Tildy (1918\u20132012), and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tildy (1921\u20131983). ===Political career and later life=== Tildy palace \u2013 Andr\u00e1ssy avenue 96 Tildy was elected to the Hungarian parliament in 1933, being reelected in 1936 and 1939. He put pressure on Horthy's government to pull out of the Second World War. After Hungary was occupied by the Germans, Tildy was forced into hiding. After the Soviets occupied Hungary and drove out the Germans, Tildy became leader of the FKgP. Tildy became Prime Minister of Hungary, serving from November 15, 1945 until February 1, 1946, when Tildy was elected President of Hungary. He was an ex officio member of the High National Council from December 7, 1945 until February 2, 1946. Tildy served as the first President of the Republic of Hungary until July 31, 1948, when he was forced to resign after allegations emerged about his son-in-law being arrested for corruption and adultery. Tildy was held under house arrest in Budapest until 1 May 1956. He was appointed to the position of a state minister in the coalition government during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. He was eventually arrested by Soviet forces after the revolution was crushed by Warsaw Pact intervention. On June 15, 1958, Tildy was sentenced by the Supreme Court to six years' imprisonment, in the trial of Imre Nagy and associates. However, he was released under an individual amnesty in April 1959 in view of his advanced years (in fact due to illness). He then lived in complete retirement until he died in Budapest on August 3, 1961.Zolt\u00e1n Tildy, Heads of States and Governments Since 1945, page 364 ==References== * F\u00f6glein Gizella: Az \u00e1llamf\u0151 \"int\u00e9zm\u00e9nye\" 1944 \u00e9s 1949 k\u00f6z\u00f6tt * Haas Gy\u00f6rgy: A kisgazda \u00e1llamminiszter * Sulinet ==External links== * Category:1889 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Lu\u010denec Category:People from the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Hungarian Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:Hungarian Calvinist and Reformed clergy Category:Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party politicians Category:Presidents of Hungary Category:Prime Ministers of Hungary Category:Members of the National Assembly of Hungary (1945\u20131947) Category:Burials at Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ",
