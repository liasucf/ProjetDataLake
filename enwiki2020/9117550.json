    "text": "Toquegua may be the name of a group of people, and a language, spoken along the Atlantic coast of Guatemala and Honduras from the area around the mouth of the Golfo Dulce to the Ulua river in Honduras. It is also an elite indigenous family surname in colonial Honduras, and a place name in the Motagua river valley in 1536. Feldman (1975), largely based on unpublished notes of Nicholas Helmuth conserved in the American Philosophical Society, concludes that Toquegua is a Ch\u02bcol Mayan-related language. Sheptak (2007) contests that identification and concludes the people referred to as the Toquegua were multi-lingual, speaking Yucatec, Ch\u02bcol, Nahuatl, and Lenca. The Toquegua were merchants of cacao and feathers (particularly quetzal feathers) in the sixteenth century and hosted Yucatec Maya people in their communities. == References == * Feldman, Lawrence H.
