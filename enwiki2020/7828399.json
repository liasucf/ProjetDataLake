Johann Forster Forsterus, F\u00f6rster or Forstheim (10 July 1496, in Augsburg - 7 December 1558, in Wittenberg) was a Lutheran theologian, Protestant reformer and professor of Hebrew. He took part in the Protestation at Speyer. Johann-Forster studied Hebrew at the University of Ingolstadt under Johannes Reuchlin (1455 - 1522) and continued his studies at the University of Leipzig and the University of Wittenberg. He was mentored by Martin Luther and helped him with the translation of the bible into German, being especially useful because of his knowledge of Hebrew. ==References== :extensive article at :de:Johann Forster Category:1496 births Category:1558 deaths Category:German Lutheran theologians Category:Writers from Augsburg Category:German male non-fiction writers ",
