    "text": "Jerry Garcia was an American musician. A guitarist, singer, and songwriter, he became famous as a member of the rock band the Grateful Dead, from 1965 to 1995. When not touring or recording with the Dead, Garcia was often playing music in other bands and with other musicians. From 1971 to 1975, Garcia's main musical collaborator outside the Grateful Dead was keyboardist Merl Saunders. From 1975 to 1995, Garcia's principal side project was the Jerry Garcia Band. The one constant member of the Jerry Garcia Band, as well as the various Saunders\u2013Garcia lineups, was John Kahn on bass. The Garcia Band member with the second-longest tenure, from 1980 to 1995, was keyboardist Melvin Seals. In the 1990s, Garcia also made a number of studio recordings with mandolin player David Grisman. In 1969, Garcia, along with John Dawson and David Nelson, co-founded the country rock band the New Riders of the Purple Sage. Garcia played pedal steel guitar in that band, until an amicable parting of the ways in 1971. In 1973 Garcia co-founded the short-lived bluegrass group Old & In the Way, which also included David Grisman and John Kahn. Garcia played banjo in that band, harking back to his pre-Grateful Dead days as a bluegrass musician. The Grateful Dead released a number of studio and live albums while they were together. Since then, many archival concert recordings of the band have been released as albums. The same is also true of Garcia's solo career and his collaborations with other musicians. As a result, the discography of Jerry Garcia, as a member of the Grateful Dead and as a solo musician, includes several hundred albums. == Grateful Dead == == Jerry Garcia == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" width=25% | Title ! scope=\"col\" width=20% | Released ! scope=\"col\" width=50% | Notes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;font-size:100%;\" | Peak chart position (US) |- | Garcia | * January 1972 * Warner Bros.

The band played rock music that emphasized musical improvisation, in a style somewhat similar to that of the Grateful Dead, and also played many rhythm and blues songs. The lineup of the band changed many times, especially in the early years. The only constant member was John Kahn on bass. The Garcia Band member with the second-longest tenure, from 1980 to 1995, was keyboardist Melvin Seals. After Garcia died, Seals formed a band called JGB, dedicated to performing Garcia's music. Donna Jean Godchaux, who was in the Jerry Garcia Band from 1976 to 1978, later reflected, \"It was very different from the Grateful Dead in that everything was so scaled back to where we could play theaters instead of hockey rinks. It was very enjoyable on that level because these places were built for music to be played in. It was just a really unique situation to be as popular as Jerry Garcia was and still be able to be in a band that could do what we did in a smaller setting than the Grateful Dead. It was kind of like a home away from home for Jerry, in that he got this different expression of what he was feeling musically than the Grateful Dead.\" {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"

In 1970 he played a number of Monday night jam sessions with Garcia at the Matrix, a small venue in San Francisco. The two were often accompanied by John Kahn on bass and Bill Vitt on drums. Later, Kahn recalled, \"I didn't know what kind of music [Garcia] and Wales would be playing down at the Matrix when I went down. And I still don't know! It was kind of a weird jazz with these other influences \u2013 it was mainly Howard's music, all instrumental.\" Garcia said, \"Howard was so incredible, and [Kahn and I] were just hanging on for dear life. For some reason Howard enjoyed playing with us, but we were just keeping up. Howard was so outside. For both of us that was a wonderful experience.\" {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" width=25% | Title ! scope=\"col\" width=20% | Released ! scope=\"col\" width=50% | Notes ! scope=\"col\" width=5% | Peak chart position (US) |- | Hooteroll? | * November 1971 * Douglas KZ 30859 * LP | * Studio album |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Side Trips, Volume One | * October 1998 * Grateful Dead GDCD 4061 * CD | * Recorded in 1970 at the Matrix in San Francisco |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |} == Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders == Merl Saunders, a keyboard player, was Garcia's main musical collaborator outside the Grateful Dead from 1971 to 1975. Saunders and Garcia bands with different additional musicians played many concerts during this period. One of the lineups, in 1974 and 1975, was Legion of Mary, featuring Martin Fierro on saxophone and flute, John Kahn on bass, and Ron Tutt on drums. Saunders and Garcia also recorded two studio albums with Tom Fogerty from Creedence Clearwater Revival. Garcia later recalled, \"[Saunders] really helped me improve myself on a level of harmonic understanding.... He filled me in on all those years of things I didn't do. I'd never played any standards; I'd never played in dance bands. I never had any approach to the world of regular, straight music. He knows all the standards, and he taught me how bebop works. He taught me music. Between the combination of Howard [Wales] and Merl, that's where I really learned music. Before it was sort of, 'Okay, where do I plug in?' I picked up the adult version of a musical attitude from those guys.\"Jackson, pp. 205\u2013206. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:25%\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%\" | Artist ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%\" | Released ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:30%\" | Notes ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart position |- ! style=\"width:5%;font-size:80%;\"| US ! style=\"width:5%;font-size:80%;\"| US Ind. |- | Heavy Turbulence | Merl Saunders | * January 1972 * Fantasy 8421 * LP | * Studio album |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Fire Up | Merl Saunders featuring Jerry Garcia and Tom Fogerty | * May 1973 * Fantasy 9421 * LP | * Studio album |align=\"center\" | 197 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Live at Keystone | Merl Saunders, Jerry Garcia, John Kahn, Bill Vitt | * December 1973 * Fantasy F-79002 * 2-disc LP * re-released in 1988 as two separate CDs | * Recorded July 10 \u2013 11, 1973 at the Keystone in Berkeley, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Keystone Encores | Merl Saunders, Jerry Garcia, John Kahn, Bill Vitt | * March 1988 * Fantasy FCD-7703-2 * CD * also released as two separate LPs | * Recorded July 10 \u2013 11, 1973 at the Keystone in Berkeley, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Fire Up Plus | Merl Saunders and Friends | * July 9, 1992 * Fantasy FCD-7711-2 * CD | * Compilation album including all of Heavy Turbulence and most of Fire Up |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Keepers | Merl Saunders and Friends | * October 21, 1997 * Fantasy FCD-7712-2 * CD | * Compilation of various Merl Saunders tracks from the early 1970s, many of them with Garcia |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley, September 1, 1974 | Jerry Garcia & Merl Saunders Band | * December 28, 2004 * Jerry Made JGCD 0004 * 3-disc CD | * Pure Jerry #4 * Recorded September 1, 1974 at the Keystone in Berkeley, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Legion of Mary: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 1 | Legion of Mary | * August 13, 2005 * Rhino R2 74692 * 2-disc CD | * Recorded December 1974 \u2013 July 1975 at various venues |align=\"center\" | 190 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Well-Matched: The Best of Merl Saunders & Jerry Garcia | Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia | * May 23, 2006 * Fantasy FCD-30019-2 * CD | * Compilation of selections from Heavy Turbulence, Fire Up, Live at Keystone, Keystone Encores, and Keepers |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Keystone Companions: The Complete 1973 Fantasy Recordings | Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia | * September 25, 2012 * Fantasy FAN-33796 * 4-disc CD | * Recorded July 10 \u2013 11, 1973 at the Keystone in Berkeley, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Garcia Live Volume Three | Legion of Mary | * October 15, 2013 * ATO JGFRR 1003 * 3-disc CD | * Recorded December 14, 1974 at the Paramount Theatre in Portland, Oregon and December 15, 1974 at the EMU Ballroom in Eugene, Oregon |align=\"center\" | 102 |align=\"center\" | 25 |- | Garcia Live Volume Six | Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders | * June 24, 2016 * ATO JGFRR 1009 * 3-disc CD | * Recorded July 5, 1973 at the Lion's Share in San Anselmo, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | 12 |- | Garcia Live Volume Nine | Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders | * July 28, 2017 * ATO JGFRR 1015 * 2-disc CD | * Recorded August 11, 1974 at the Keystone in Berkeley, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | 8 |- | Garcia Live Volume 12 | Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders | * December 20, 2019 * ATO JGFRR 1029 * 3-disc CD | * Recorded January 23, 1973 at the Boarding House in San Francisco, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | 7 |} == Jerry Garcia and David Grisman == David Grisman is a mandolin player.

Its best-known lineup was Jerry Garcia on banjo, Peter Rowan on guitar, David Grisman on mandolin, John Kahn on bass, and Vassar Clements on fiddle. Author Jeff Tamarkin wrote, \"Although OAITW was able to handle a traditional bluegrass number \u2013 vocal or instrumental \u2013 as well as anyone, the musicians brought a jam band sensibility and rock attitude to the proceedings, extending the instrumental segments with improvisations, something alien to bluegrass up to that point.

During this time he was a member of a number of different bands, including the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, the Hart Valley Drifters, the Wildwood Boys, and the Black Mountain Boys. Subsequently he co-founded a jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. The jug band was a precursor of the Grateful Dead, as its members also included Bob Weir and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:25%\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%\" | Artist ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%\" | Released ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:30%\" | Notes ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart position |- ! style=\"width:5%;font-size:80%;\"| US ! style=\"width:5%;font- size:80%;\"| Folk |- | Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions | Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions | * 1999 * Grateful Dead GDCD 4064 * CD | * Recorded July 1964 at the Top of the Tangent in Palo Alto, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | Folk Time | Hart Valley Drifters | * November 11, 2016 * ATO JGFRR 1011 * CD | * Recorded in 1962 at the studios of KZSU in Stanford, California |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | 5 |- | Before the Dead | Various artists | * May 11, 2018 * ATO JGFRR 1016 * 4-disc CD | * Recorded 1961 \u2013 1964 at various venues in the San Francisco Bay Area |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |align=\"center\" | 13 |} == Compilations and box sets == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" width=25% | Title ! scope=\"col\" width=20% | Released ! scope=\"col\" width=50% | Notes ! scope=\"col\" width=5% | Peak chart position (US) |- | All Good Things: Jerry Garcia Studio Sessions | * April 20, 2004 * Rhino R2 78063 * 6-disc CD | * Box set containing the albums Garcia, Compliments, Reflections, Run for the Roses, and Cats Under the Stars, with bonus tracks and a bonus disc |align=\"center\" | 175 |- | Garcia Plays Dylan | * October 25, 2005 * Rhino R2 73263 * 2-disc CD | * Compilation of Garcia performing Bob Dylan songs with the Grateful Dead, the Jerry Garcia Band, Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders, and Legion of Mary |align=\"center\" | \u2014 |- | The Very Best of Jerry Garcia | * September 26, 2006 * Rhino R2 73391 * 2-disc CD | * Disc 1 compiles tracks from the five studio albums by Jerry Garcia or the Jerry Garcia Band.
