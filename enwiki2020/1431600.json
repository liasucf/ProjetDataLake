    "text": "Sudan has had national level elections since 1948 while it was still an Anglo\u2013Egyptian colony. Independence from or union with Egypt was a major electoral platform in the 1948 election. In typical elections since then, Sudan elects on a national level head of state - the president - and a legislature. In the election of 2010, there were two presidential elections, one for the Presidency of the Republic of Sudan and one for the Presidency of the Government of Southern Sudan. Elections for the unicameral, 360-member National Assembly were last held in April 2015. The National Legislature whose members were chosen in mid-2005 had two chambers. The National Assembly (Majlis Watani) consisted of 450 appointed members who represented the government, former rebels, and other opposition political parties. The Council of States (Majlis Welayat) had 50 members who were indirectly elected by state legislatures. All members of the National Legislature served six-year terms. In the early twenty-first century, Sudan was a dominant-party state with the National Congress in power. Opposition parties were allowed, but were widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. On 11 April 2019, Sudan was taken over by a military junta after the military seized power from the President in a coup. Federal elections were tentatively scheduled for 2022 under the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy deal. ==Latest elections== ===Presidential elections=== ===Parliamentary elections=== ==See also== *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==References== ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *African Elections Database *Elections and the Probability of Violence in Sudan *Sudan Electionnaire *sudanvotes.com *Electoral Designs: Representation, Proportionality and Constituency Boundaries in Sudan's 2010 Elections ",
