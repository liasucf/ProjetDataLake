    "text": "The propaganda tactic of red-tagging in the Philippines has often been directed towards individuals and organizations critical of the Philippine government, who are labeled \"communist\" or \"terrorist\" regardless of their actual beliefs or affiliations. Red-tagging has had a long history in the country, and cause oriented groups including the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch warn that the use of red-tagging as a political tactic continues to undermine Philippine democracy by stifling dissent, encouraging authoritarian practices, and generally having a chilling effect on discourse and debate. Organizations frequently subject to red- tagging in the Philippines include human rights organizations, church or religious groups, health worker unions, the academe, and the mainstream media. Some of these organizations and institutions are branded as fronts, supporters, or sympathizers of the New People Army. == Definitions == Commonly defined as the harassment or persecution of a person because of \"known or suspected communist sympathies,\" the extensive history of red-tagging in the Philippines has led to the recognition of several formal definitions by the Philippine Government. The Commission on Human Rights follows the definition laid down by the International Peace Observers Network (IPON), which defines it as: > \"An act of State actors, particularly law enforcement agencies, to publicly > brand individuals, groups, or institutions as...affiliated to communist or > leftist terrorists.\" Additionally, the term has been defined in Philippine Jurisprudence through the dissenting opinion of Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Leonen in the 2105 court case Zarate vs. Aquino III (G.R. No. 220028 J. Leonen Dissenting Opinion, November 10, 2015), in which Leonen adopted a 2011 journals' definition of red-tagging: > \"the act of labelling, branding, naming and accusing individuals and/ or > organizations of being left-leaning, subversives, communists or terrorists > (used as) a strategy...by State agents, particularly law enforcement > agencies and the military, against those perceived to be 'threats' or > 'enemies of the State.'\" == Effects == Red-tagging impinges on the right to free expression and dissent according to media and rights groups. The Philippine Commission of Human Rights (CHR) also noted that red-tagging threatens the lives or safety of individuals. Four activists killed in June 2015 in Sorsogon City may have been the result of the activists's membership in groups that were red-tagged by the Philippine government, according to Amnesty International. The CHR stated that red-tagging needs to be seen in the context of the increasing extrajudicial killings in rural Philippines and the government's counterinsurgency program. Security forces have raided the offices of red-tagged organizations and arrested members of these organizations. The raids have been described as a crackdown on dissent. In some instances, targets of red-baiting are also harassed by accusations of terrorism. The Philippine independent news organization Vera Files notes that since President Rodrigo Duterte declared the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army (CPP-NPA) a terrorist organization under the Human Security Act of 2007, individuals and organizations who have been red-tagged are vulnerable to interception and recording of communication, detention without charges, restricted travel and personal liberties, examination of bank records, and the seizure and sequestration of their assets. Reporters Without Borders notes that red-tagged individuals are vulnerable to death threats and violence. == Red-tagging of specific groups == === Civil-rights activists === Human rights advocates and human rights organizations in the Philippines, whether civil society, intergovernment, and even governmental in nature, have often been the subject of \"defamatory and intimidating public statements\" as a result of their human rights monitoring work. The leftist women's advocacy group Gabriela Women's Party were also red-tagged. === Ethnic-rights activists === In 2018 a United Nations Human Rights Council report counted \"at least 80 recognized human rights defenders, indigenous peoples' representatives, and representatives of community-based organizations,\" which the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte had labeled as terrorists in connection with their work, some of which was part of their \"cooperation with the United Nations.\" This included UN Special Rapporteur Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, who was falsely listed as a senior member of the NPA. In October 2018, the government released a matrix of names involved in what it alleged to be a \"Red October\" plot. The list included names of activists from the Liberal Party, the Catholic Church, universities, and various human rights and labor groups. Transportation strikes organized against the rapid modernization of jeepneys were swept up by the Department of Transportation as a communist plot. In January 2019, indigenous Lumad leaders Datu Jomorito Guaynon and Ireneo Udarbe were arrested after being accused by police and state elements of being communist rebel recruiters. Both have frequently organized protests against ancestral land encroachment and mining, activities which have nothing to do with Socialism let alone Communism. In August 2019, Brandon Lee, an American ancestral-domain paralegal and Cordillera Human Rights Alliance volunteer, was shot four times outside his home in Ifugao province, putting him in a coma. Since 2015, posters claiming Lee and other IPM members as \"enemies of the state\" and members of the NPA had been circulating in the province. === Labor unions === The National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW), established by Negrense sugarcane workers in La Carlota, Negros Occidental in 1971,Gonzaga, V. L. (1988). Agrarian reform in Negros Oriental. Philippine Studies, 36(4), 443\u2013457. had been denounced as a front for the Communist Party of the Philippines as well as accused of profiteering on privately owned land.https://news.abs- cbn.com/video/news/10/23/18/pnp-claims-slain-negros-farmers-org-is-red-legal- front This then became the ex post facto justification for the Sagay massacre in which nine NFSW members were killed. Violent socioeconomic conflict has been a plague on a heavily stratified Negrense society since the 1850s.Gonzaga, V. L. (1990). Negros in transition: 1899\u20131905. Philippine Studies, 38(1), 103\u2013114.Billig, M. S. (1992). The rationality of growing sugar on Negros. Philippine Studies, 40(2), 153\u2013182. === Journalists === The Facebook page of National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) posted a series of infographics that incorrectly said media giant ABS-CBN's franchise was not renewed because \u201cthey have issues with the law.\u201d Verified pages of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) and Radio Television Malaca\u00f1ang (RVTM) shared NTF-ELCAC posts pertaining to ABS- CBN's franchise. This act of NTF-ELCAC and the involved government pages were condemned by journalists, academics and media groups as \u201cblack propaganda offensive\u201d and an abuse of authority of NTF-ELCAC that endangers ABS-CBN's workforce and Maria Ressa. Journalists have raised concerns over worsening attacks against the press after the red-tagging incidents of a veteran journalist, Froilan Gallardo, and a former National Union Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), director Leonardo Vicente \u201cCong\u201d Corrales; who was targeted by death threat. Journalists and artists are tagged as supporters of \u201ccommunist terrorists\u201d and active members of the Communist Party of the Philippines or also known as New People's Army. Pampanga TV manager Sonia Soto, who is also the president of the media arm of the LausGroup of Companies, was red tagged by National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (Nica) regional director, Rolando Asuncion, during a forum at Don Honorio Ventura State University in Bacolor town. The director identified her as among the 31 radio broadcasters in the country who had links to communist and terrorist groups. \"Ang Iskul kong Bakwit,\" a documentary by Atom Araullo aired on GMA News TV's i-Witness. After airing, alleged Indigenous People leaders issued a statement condemning the said documentary as \u201cblatantly propagandistic documentary,\u201d and accused journalist Atom Araullo as \u201cbiased.\u201d Said IP leaders went as far as linking journalist Atom Araullo to communist insurgency through his mother, Carol Araullo, chairperson of Bayan. National Union of Journalists of the Philippines issued a statement condemning attacks against Atom Araullo by the government through National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) saying this is an \u201cincredulous tactic\u201d used by the government in vilifying critics and linking them to communist insurgency. . === Religious organizations === The National Council of Churches in the Philippines has also been red-tagged At around the same time, security forces raided the offices of red-tagged organizations and arrested 57 individuals. === Humanitarian organizations === Humanitarian organization Oxfam has been falsely accused by the Philippine Department of National Defense of being a communist and terror front. === Entertainers === In 2020, actress Angel Locsin, after she criticized Congress, was falsely accused of being a terrorist and a member of the NPA. === State institutions === State institutions have not been immune to cannibalistic vilification by the taxpayer-funded government. The Philippine Commission of Human Rights, a constitutional agency independent of the three branches of government, mandated to monitor human rights abuses by state actors, has also received various threats from the government. ==Media coverage== While there is some coverage of red-tagging as a practice in Filipino mainstream news coverage, media watchgroups such as the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility have noted that this is typically limited to reportage regarding the statements of the groups involved, and few news outlets add \"the necessary explanation why the profiling of the two organizations is dangerous.\" In a January 2019 statement, they said: > \"Dissent is essential to a working democracy. The independent press has to > remind its audience of that fact as attempts to discredit various groups > critical of the current regime continue, rather than just report statements > of public officials condemning the politics of the Left and publicly naming > those they see as 'Red.'\" == See also == * Red-baiting * Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in the Philippines == References == Category:Communism in the Philippines Category:Anti-communist terminology Category:Anti-communist terrorism Category:Ethically disputed political practices Category:Political repression in the Philippines Category:Political and cultural purges ",
