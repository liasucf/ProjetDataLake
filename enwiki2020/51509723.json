    "text": "Hurdcott House is a country house in Barford St Martin, Wiltshire, England, roughly west of Salisbury. It became a Grade II listed building on 29 May 1987. ==History== In the Domesday Book a \"Babestoche\" is mentioned, which is believed to have contained the manor of Hurdcott. During Elizabethan times it was held by Thomas Gawen. In 1708 it was acquired by the Pitts family, and was later owned by the MP Alexander Powell (1782\u20131847), who married into the Pitts family. The entomologist John Henry Leech had his home at Hurdcott House, and died there in 1900. ==Architecture== An earlier house on the estate dated to 1631. The current two-storey house with three bays dates to the early-mid 19th century, and features Flemish brickwork with a slate roof, and a Tuscan doorcase. At the base of the rear wings of the house are 4-flue brick stacks. The estate contains several other Grade II listed landmarks, including the bridge carrying the drive from North Lodge to Hurdcott House, which is a late 18th-century limestone ashlar bridge over the River Nadder, and a limestone pillar milestone about east of the West Drive. ==References== Category:Country houses in Wiltshire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Wiltshire Category:Grade II listed houses ",
