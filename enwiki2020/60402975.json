It is decorated with carved lotus buds, dragon heads, and Dancheong paintwork. Jinnamgwan Hall is long and tall. The original building, commissioned by Naval Commander Yi Si-eon, was completed in 1599 during the Joseon dynasty. It stood on the former site of Jinhaeru, the naval base of Jeolla Province. That naval base was the headquarters of Admiral Yi Sun-sin during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592 and burned down in 1597. Jinnamgwan Hall was used as a guest house for government officials. A fire destroyed the building in 1716, but it was rebuilt two years later by Admiral Yi Je-myeon. Jinnamgwan Hall was converted into an elementary school in 1911 during the Japanese rule over Korea, damaging the original structure.Picture of sign at Jinnamgwan Hall on KakaoMap.
