The group features cartoonist Lauren Weinstein on lead vocals with Patrick Hambrecht, the band songwriter. Hambrecht, a Southern Baptist from Papillion, Nebraska, moved to New York City in 1996. Their music has been described as a mix of psychedelic folk, noise music and pop music, similar to other New Weird America artists, but with a more aggressive, transgressive bent, akin to bands like Psychic TV. The group's prior incarnation, Rock Rock Chicken Pox, featured Dame Darcy and members of Laddio Bolocko. The band has three albums; Get Old and Die with Flaming Fire, Songs from the Shining Temple and When the High Bell Rings. Their music has been featured on various compilations, including WFMU's Tunes From the Toxic Terrain and Psycho-O-Path Records' Space is No Place, NYC: Noise from the Underground. In December 2009, the arts collective organized a holiday art show and performance space in Brooklyn entitled \"The Flaming Fire Temple Presents: Eternal Christmas \u2013 A Yuletide Dreamland\", sponsored by Atlantic Assets and Issue Project Room. The show featured visual art by Camilla Ha, Dame Darcy, Dewanatron, Lauren Weinstein, Jared Whitham, Patrick Smith, Alyssa Taylor Wendt and Jenny Gonzalez-Blitz. It featured a live recording project from LYDSOD each night, and performances by many friends of the band, including Autodrone, Laura Ortman, The Clean's Hamish Kilgour, Martin Bisi, Joe McGinty's Circuit Parade, Gelatine and others. The installation was described in articles by Vice Magazine and The New York Times, and kept a website. == References == ;Other sources * New Yorker Review: http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/nightlife/2007/03/26/070326goni_GOAT_nightlife?currentPage=2 * Vice Magazine Interview: https://web.archive.org/web/20090425093807/http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2007/01/new_york_flamin.html * New York Times Interview: https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E6DA153AF933A15757C0A9659C8B63&sec;=&spon;= * Vice Magazine article on Eternal Christmas: http://www.viceland.com/blogs/en/2009/12/16/flaming-fire-presents-eternal- christmas-a-yuletide-dreamland/ * New York Times blog on Eternal Christmas: https://archive.is/20130104092609/http://fort- greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/snow-drives-back-the-foot-thats-slow/ ==External links== * Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:Psychedelic folk groups Category:2000 establishments in New York City ",
