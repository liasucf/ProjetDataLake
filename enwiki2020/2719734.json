    "text": "Communist Party of Turkey (in Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye Kom\u00fcnist Partisi) is a clandestine political party in Turkey. The party, which split from the historical Communist Party of Turkey in 1978, is often known as Communist Party of Turkey (Workers Voice); because the main publication of the party is \u0130\u015f\u00e7inin Sesi (Workers Voice). However the party considers itself as the continuation of the historical entity. In the 1980s and 1990s it had strong links with the group around John Chamberlain (who uses the pen-name of \"Jack Conrad\") and his supporters who publish the Weekly Worker in Britain. Some members of Chamberlain's group went so far as to join the TKP. == See also == * List of illegal political parties in Turkey * Communist Party of Turkey (disambiguation) for other communist parties in Turkey ==External links== *Party website Category:1978 establishments in Turkey Category:Clandestine groups Category:Communist parties in Turkey Category:Far-left politics in Turkey Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Turkey Category:Political parties established in 1978 ",
