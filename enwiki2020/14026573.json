It features uncredited vocals by singer Amy Winehouse and was produced by Salaam Remi for Mutya Buena's debut album, Real Girl, being released as the fourth and final single from the album. ==Background== It borrows melodic and lyrical passages from \"Be My Baby\" by The Ronettes. The chorus to Buena's version is sung by British singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse. The single was a commercial failure for Mutya and her label, charting at number 73 on the UK Top 75. However, promotion for the single managed to get the album back into the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 88 and peaking at number 83. \"B Boy Baby\" has since been used in various adverts on UK television. The single had a brief rebirth of minor success in America with a leaked remix featuring rappers Klepto and Complex. Record labels were never able to obtain distribution rights and the remixed single was only released on the artists personal mixtape titled Why U Mad Vol. 1 and later on YouTube.The Official UK Charts Company : TOP 100 ALBUMS CHART In 2008, the song surged in downloads and peaked at number one on the Greek's iTunes Top 10 Singles Chart. ==Music video== The video premiered on 4Music on 4 December 2007.YouTube - Mutya Buena - B Boy Baby - Ft Amy Winehouse It was filmed in Millennium Square, Bristol, and features \"The Physical Jerks\" \u2013 a group of break dancers.
