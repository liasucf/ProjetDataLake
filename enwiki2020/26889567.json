It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on May 12. ==Plot summary== A young man, Enoch, is out of school and has been befriended by a ghost of a Japanese kamikaze pilot. For unexplained reasons, he attends the funerals of strangers without invitation; at one of these he meets a young woman, Annabel, who says she works with children who have cancer, and the two start spending time together. Later Annabel acknowledges she has cancer herself, a fact which Enoch appears to accommodate, even when Annabel discovers she has only three months left to live. As their relationship becomes romantic, Enoch's placidity is explained by his own history of near-death experience, but when the loss of Annabel becomes a reality his behaviour betrays more evidence of turmoil. Annabel accepts and reacts to this. At Annabel's memorial Enoch asks to speak, but before he says anything memories of the couple's happiness together appear to resolve his grief. ==Cast== * Henry Hopper as Enoch Brae * Mia Wasikowska as Annabel \"Annie\" Cotton * Ry\u014d Kase as Hiroshi Takahashi, a ghost and Enoch's friend * Schuyler Fisk as Elizabeth Cotton, Annabel's older sister * Jane Adams as Mabel Tell, Enoch's aunt and guardian * Chin Han as Dr. Lee, Annabel's physician * Lusia Strus as Rachel Cotton, Annabel and Elizabeth's mother ==Production== The film was produced through Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment by daughter and father Bryce Dallas Howard and Ron Howard, as well as Brian Grazer.
