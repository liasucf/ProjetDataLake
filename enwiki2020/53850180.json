    "text": "Judith and Her Maidservant is a painting by the Italian baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi. Executed sometime between 1640 and 1645, it hangs in the Musee de la Castre, Cannes. The story comes from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, in which Judith seduces and then beheads the general Holofernes. The precise moment painted takes place after the murder when her maidservant places the severed head in a bag, while Judith checks around her. It is the second of three paintings that Gentileschi painted of the same moment, using a similar design. One was painted much earlier (and hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts), while the other was painted later in the 1640s now hangs in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples == References == category:1640s paintings Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi ",
