It takes classes from the 6th form to the end of education (8 classes per level). == Appearance == It consists of a college, a lyc\u00e9e and classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles (CGPE), in the sections MP, PC and PSI. Some classes are located at 47, rue de Naples and others at 24, rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Foy. The F\u00e9nelon college was founded in 1869 by priests from the diocese of Paris. Until 1968, it was just for lyc\u00e9e students; it then joined with the Sainte-Marie de Monceau college, run by the Society of Mary (Marianists) and became the F\u00e9nelon Sainte-Marie College from Year 11 to the end of schooling. A later merge happened with the Saint-Augustin College, rue de la Bienfaisance, which established primary classes. The establishment then took the name of F\u00e9nelon Sainte-Marie Saint-Augustin. Finally, in 1980, with the merger with Sainte-Marie La Madeleine, a girls' school from primary pupils on rue de Monceau and rue de Tocqueville, the school became mixed. === School ranking === In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 30th out of 109 at d\u00e9partemental level in terms of quality of teaching, and 257th at national level.Classement D\u00e9partemental et National des lyc\u00e9es fran\u00e7ais The ranking was based on three criteria: the level of bac results, the proportion of students achieving their baccalaur\u00e9at having spent their last two years at the establishment, and the added value (calculated based on social origin of the students, their age, and their national diploma results).M\u00e9thodologie du classement national des lyc\u00e9es fran\u00e7ais === CPGE rankings === The national rankings of classes pr\u00e9paratoires aux grandes \u00e9coles (CPGE) are calculated based on level of admission of students to the grandes \u00e9coles.
