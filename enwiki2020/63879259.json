His father was a farmer and rancher, and his mother was an aspiring writer and artist. When he was about a year old, his father and his grandfather sold out their interests in California and bought a ranch in eastern Oregon.

In 1956, shortly before Nesbitt's eighth birthday, he learned that his mother had died. When Nesbitt and his brothers were old enough to work in the fields, they and their father followed the seasonal agricultural work and lived in and near several small towns across California. === Education === Nesbitt attended Orland High School in Orland, California, where he was a top student in mathematics and graduated with honors in foreign languages. He attended Chico State College, majoring in mathematics, but changed to English, out of a desire to become a published author.
