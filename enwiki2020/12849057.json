    "text": "Sadist is a death metal band from Genoa, Italy, founded in 1991. The band split up in 2000 after releasing their Lego album, but reunited in 2005 and released their self-titled album in 2007. ==History== Sadist was formed in 1991 when Tommy Talamanca(guitar, keyboards) and Peso (Necrodeath - drums) started auditioning for musicians to complete their lineup. A few weeks after the auditions, Andy (bass) and Fabio (vocals) joined. While playing locally with original content from their demo, they were signed by the indie label Obscure Plasma Records. Their demo was released as Black Screams EP in September 1991, and sold 2500 copies worldwide. The EP was later released in 1992 by American indie label Wild Rag Records in a three-track version. The band toured Italy and France until Fabio left the band, which forced Andy to play bass as well as sing. Shortly afterward, the band played a show in Lisbon and were well received by audience and local media. The band then obtained a record deal with Nosferatu Records for a two-album contract and released Above the Light in 1993. Andy left the band, replaced by bassist Chicco and a new singer, Zanna. In late 1993, the band recorded a video for the song \"Sometimes They Come Back\" from the Above the Light album and toured France and the Netherlands. In early 1994, Sadist supported Carcass during the Italian shows for their \"Heartwork\" tour; a few months later they supported Samael in France. While on tour, the band worked on songs for their new album and in May 1995 entered Rhythm Studios in Bidford on Avon, England, where they started recording their second album. In 1996, Tribe was released in February, distributed by Sun Rising Records for Europe and Toy's Factory for Japan. The band toured to promote the new album in France, Italy, and the Netherlands until June and their second video, \"Tribe,\" was broadcast all over Europe. In November, Sadist headlined Mindviews Belgian Metal Convention, and later were featured on the Japanese Iron Maiden tribute with their version of \"Wrathchild.\" At the end of 1996, drummer Peso left to work on an old side- project and was replaced by Oinos. Singer Zanna and bass player Chicco were replaced by singer Trevor and bass player Andy. In early 1997, the band started recording sessions for their next album, but before the album was released Oinos left the band, replaced by Alessio. At the end of 1997, Sadist signed with label Displeased Records and releases Crust that same year. The album was also distributed successfully in Japan. In 1998, the band released their third music video, \"'Fools' and Dolts.\" Shortly afterwards, the band travelled to Germany to play at European festival Wacken Open Air as the first Italian metal band to play there. In 1999, the band signed with Impact/System Shock and produced the new album Lego by themselves at Nadir Recording and Mastering. The response to the album was not as favorable as to previous albums, and the band decided to take a break for a while. They reunited in 2005 and signed with Italian indie label Beyond Productions. They re-released Above the Light and Tribe both remastered at Nadir Recording and Mastering. In late 2006, the band stareds recording sessions for a new album, with guest musicians like Claudio Simonetti and Dado Sezzi. The album was released in April 2007 and their fourth video for \"Tearing Away\" was made. The band toured the rest of the year, headlining two Armenian festivals, \"Highland Metalfest\" and \"Rock the Borders.\" Sadist are currently working on a new album. ==Discography== === Studio albums === * Above the Light (1993) * Tribe (1996) * Crust (1997) * Lego (2000) * Sadist (2007) * Season in Silence (2010) * Hyaena (2015) * Spellbound (2018) ===EPs and demos=== * Black Screams (1991) (demo) * Black Screams (1991) (EP) ==Videography== * \"Sometimes They Come Back\" \u2013 Above the Light (1993) * \"Tribe\" \u2013 Tribe (1996) * \"'Fools' and Dolts\" \u2013 Crust (1998) * \"Tearing Away\" \u2013 Sadist (2007) * \"One Thousand Memories\" \u2013 Sadist (2007) * \"The Lonely Mountain\" \u2013 Hyaena (2015) * \"Den Siste Kamp\" Ft.
