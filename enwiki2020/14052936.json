Ulf of Borresta (Old Norse: Ulfr \u00ed B\u00e1rist\u00f6\u00f0um, modern Swedish: Ulf i Borresta) was a runemaster in the eleventh century Uppland, Sweden, and a successful Viking who returned from England three times with a share of the Danegeld. He is named after his estate which in modern Swedish is called Borresta or B\u00e5rresta (Old Norse: B\u00e1rista\u00f0irRundata or B\u00e1rasta\u00f0i\u0280Nordisk runnamslexikon by Lena Peterson at the Swedish Institute for Linguistics and Heritage (Institutet f\u00f6r spr\u00e5k och folkminnen).). ==Ulf's clan== Ulf belonged to a clan in what is today the parish of Orkesta, located in present-day Vallentuna Municipality, and he was the paternal nephew and successor of a man named \u00d3n\u00e6mr,Pritsak 1981:389 a name which means \"slow learner\". \u00d3n\u00e6mr is mentioned on several runestones, U 112, U 336 and probably U 328 (which is an example of the Ringerike style.Fuglesang, S.H. Swedish runestones of the eleventh century: ornament and dating, Runeninschriften als Quellen interdisziplin\u00e4rer Forschung (K.D\u00fcwel ed.). G\u00f6ttingen 1998, pp. 197-218. p. 202). The name of Gu\u00f0laug's father on U 328 is interpreted as \u00d3n\u00e6mr, and Gu\u00f0laug had a son named Holmi who fell in Italy which is mentioned on the runestone U 133.Pritsak 1981:392 Another cousin of Ulf named Ragnvaldr was the commander of the Varangian Guard in Constantinople and made the runestone U 112 in memory of himself and his mother, \u00d3n\u00e6mr's daughter. ==Runestones made by Ulf== Ulf made the runestone U 328 and also the runestone U 336 in memory of his uncle \u00d3n\u00e6mr which today is raised at the church of Orkesta. He also made the runestones U 160 and 161 for his kinsmen-by-marriage in Sk\u00e5lhammar (Old Norse: Skulhamarr). ==Runestones in Ulf's memory== There were seven runestones (runestone U 344 and runestone U 343) which were raised in Ulf's memory and they were raised together as a monument at Ytterg\u00e4rde. U 343 has disappeared but U 344 is now raised at the church of Orkesta. The runestone U 344, in the style Pr3, was found in 1868, at Ytterg\u00e4rde, by Richard Dybeck.Enoksen 1998:122 It can be dated to the first half of the 11th century because of its use of the ansuz rune for the a and \u00e6 phomenes, and because of its lack of dotted runes.Enoksen 1998:124 This stone is notable because it commemorates that Ulf had taken three danegelds in England. The first one was with Skagul Toste in 991,Pritsak 1981:392 the second one with Thorkel the High in 1012 and the last one with Canute the Great in 1018. Since there were many years between the danegelds, it is likely that Ulfr returned to Sweden after each danegeld to live as a wealthy magnate.Enoksen 1998:125 It is a remarkable feat in itself to summarize Ulf's adventurous life in so few unsentimental words.Jansson 1980:36 The runestone U 343 reports Ulf's death and it was raised in his memory by his sons Karsi and Karlbj\u00f6rn.Jansson 1980:36 ==References== ==Other sources== *Enoksen, Lars Magnar.
