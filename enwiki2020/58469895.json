    "text": "Straight-pull rifles differ from a conventional bolt action mechanisms in that the manipulation required from the user in order to chamber and extract a cartridge predominantly consists of a linear motion only, as opposed to a traditional turn-bolt action where the user has to manually rotate the bolt for chambering and primary extraction. A straight pull mechanism is also distinct from lever action and pump action mechanisms. Most straight pull rifles have a striker firing mechanism (without a hammer), and models using a hammer usually have a comparably longer lock time than hammer-less mechanisms. The Ansch\u00fctz Fortner action used in biathlon is a good example of an ergonomical straight pull rifle with good economy of motion and high operating speed. The action lever is located close to the trigger, and is accessed by slightly moving the index finger off the trigger. Pulling the lever rearwards ejects the spent casing. The bolt is then pushed forward using the thumb, upon which the firing hand lands naturally in the pistol grip so that the shooter is ready to fire immediately after completing the cycling. == Smallbore == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !class=\"unsortable\"| Image !Cartridge(s) !Years produced !Country of origin |- |Browning T-Bolt |Browning T-Bolt Sporter Maple .22 WMR |.22 Long Rifle, .17 HMR, .22 WMR |1965-1974T-Bolt 22 Rifle - Browning Support 2006-currentNew Left-Hand Browning T-Bolt Rimfires - Rifle Shooter | |- |FinnbiathlonProduced by Tampereen Asepaja Oy (Tampere Weapons Factory) | |.22 Long Rifle |1976-1984About - Lynx Rifles | |- |Izhmash Bi-7 | |.22 Long Rifle | 1979 | |- |Suhl 626/629 |East German athlete using a grip action straight pull rifle, 1984. |.22 Long Rifle |80's-?
