It includes secondary and baccalaureate along with departments for Special Education and for Special Vocational Training. Most of the students at Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Mar\u00eda primary school move on to Javier. == History == The first Jesuit school in Tudela was founded in 1600 in the old school of San Andres, partially surviving in the Official School of Languages next to the Plaza de la Juder\u00eda. The Jesuit school moved to the present Castel Ruiz, until the Suppression of the Society of Jesus. In 1891 the city took over the school at its present location, with an enrollment 54 including boarders, but it then passed into the hands of the Jesuits. During the Second Republic the Jesuits were expelled and the school became an Institute for four years. In 1936 it was revived. In 1953, the San Jos\u00e9 Vocational School (ETI) was added but transferred to the Government of Navarre in 1984. Xavier became coeducational in 1971. In 1979 the Quetzal group was founded, and the primary division passed over to the Society of Mary. The first lay director was appointed in 1995. thumb ==References== Category:Jesuit secondary schools in Spain Category:Catholic schools in Spain Category:Jesuit secondary schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1891 ",
