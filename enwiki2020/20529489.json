He started his academic career at the Polytechnic University of Turin as lecturer. In 1949 he was appointed Professor of electrical-machine construction at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he directed the postgraduate courses.Institution of Electrical Engineers (1967) Electronics & Power. Vol. 13. p. 74 and founded the postlauream course in nuclear engineering. He was elected member of the Accademia dei Lincei. Early 1960s he moved to industry. He worked for ENEL from 1963 to 1979 as general director and then president.Annual report - National Academy of Sciences 1976-77.
