    "text": "Shooting at the 2016 Summer Paralympics consisted of twelve events, eight for rifle and 4 for pistol, across a range of men's, women's and mixed events. Paralympic shooters were also classified according to the extent of their disability. The classification system allows shooters to compete against others with a similar level of function. Shooting classifications are: *SH1 - competitors who do not need a shooting stand *SH2 - competitors who use a shooting stand to support the firearm's weight ==Qualification== There were 140 athletes (100 male, 40 female) taking part in this sport. Any athlete awarded a qualification slot in one event is permitted to enter other eligible event if they have a minimum qualification score. Therefore, fields in each event are likely to be significantly larger than the qualification quotas below.
