In August of that year, Campbell Soup Company announced it was \"exploring strategic alternatives, including possible divestiture, for its Godiva Chocolatier business\"; the company said the \"premium chocolate business does not fit with Campbell's strategic focus on simple meals\".Campbell To Explore Strategic Alternatives For Godiva Business , a Campbell's press release via shareholder.com In December 2007, Campbell announced that it entered into an agreement to sell Godiva to Y\u0131ld\u0131z Holding based in Istanbul, Turkey, which is the owner of \u00dclker group and the largest consumer goods manufacturer in Turkey.

In February 2018, Godiva took out a full-page ad in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial newspaper, suggesting the retirement of the giri choco practice. In Japan, as part of the giri choco practice, women are expected to buy chocolate for their colleagues, friends, bosses and sometimes family members on Valentine's Day. The public's reaction to the ad was generally seen as favorable. Godiva has been involved in the controversy over chocolate manufactures use of child labor in the production of chocolate. == Locations == In 2016, Godiva had approximately 650 retail stores throughout the world. Godiva's global presence increased rapidly, especially in countries like China and Japan. Godiva has two factories, one in Brussels, and another in Reading, Pennsylvania, US. == Legal disputes == Lawyers of the company have sent a series of letters warning the Lady Godiva public house in Geneva, Switzerland, that they are infringing upon their intellectual property, with the latest asking them to cease and desist from using the name. Pru Porretta, MBE, who was behind the revival of Dame Goodyver's Daye in Coventry, England, where a procession through the city's streets includes her representing Lady Godiva riding a horse commented \"I think it's very sad. Godiva was a great woman who challenged her husband to stop the terrible things that were happening to the people. I'm sure Lady Godiva wouldn't care for a company which seems to be taking something that wasn't theirs originally and wants to use it for themselves and nobody else. It's about our rich heritage. I would say it's morally wrong\". ==Criticism== Godiva's Milk Chocolate was found to be heavily contaminated with nickel in a laboratory test done by the German consumer institute Stiftung Warentest in 2018. ==Gallery== Image:Godiva belgian chocolate golden box 24.JPG|Godiva Golden Box 24 pralinen Image:HK Kln Bay Telford Plaza GODIVA Chocolatier a.jpg|A Hong Kong branch Image:Godiva.jpg|Godiva store in North America ==References== ==External links== *How Chemistry Landed a Chocolatier His Dream Job, 2019 WSJ video, 5min Category:Belgian chocolate companies Category:Companies based in Brussels Category:Retail companies established in 1926 Category:Brand name chocolate Category:Y\u0131ld\u0131z Holding Category:Food and drink companies established in 1926 Category:Belgian companies established in 1926 Category:1967 mergers and acquisitions Category:2008 mergers and acquisitions ",
