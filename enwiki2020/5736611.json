They have two daughters and reside in Bedford, New York. He frequently appeared on Don Imus's radio show and was a regular caller to the New York City radio station, WFAN, to discuss his beloved Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees' rival. In 2002, he was the first fashion designer to throw out the opening pitch at Boston's Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. Abboud's mother and sister both succumbed to breast cancer. As a result, Abboud has become a breast cancer activist who designed a one-of-a-kind GMC Sierra vehicle to fundraise for a Concept:Cure charity event and has participated in many other charity events for breast cancer research. GM offered a Joseph Abboud Limited Edition Buick Regal GS and LS from 2001 to 2004, and a Joseph Abboud Limited Edition Buick Rendezvous for 2004 and 2005. Abboud was honored as one of five \"Men for the Cure\" by GQ magazine and General Motors' Concept:Cure during a breast cancer fund-raiser. Concept:Cure raised $2.6 million for breast cancer organizations. Abboud says he has a personal interest in curing breast cancer, because his mother and sister both died from the disease. ==References== ==External links== * * CFDA Members: Joseph Abboud * Abboud's book, Threads at Amazon.com * JA Apparel Corp v.
