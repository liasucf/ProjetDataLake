It was built by royal command of King Mongkut (Rama IV) in memory of Prince Unakan Ananta Norajaya, his son born to consort Piam Sucharitakul (later Princess Piyamavadi). The young prince died, at the age of 17 in the year 1873. After he died, his mother donated an amount of 8,000 baht to build public utility for the benefit of traveling to the people. Department of Sanitation (now's Department of Public Works) therefore completed the construction of this road in 1900 and received the officially name from the King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).
