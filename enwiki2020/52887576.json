After passing the Abitur exam at K\u00f6nig-Albert-Gymnasium in Freiberg, he enlisted in the Royal Saxon Army in 1875 as a one-year volunteer. After about 14 years service in his original regiment, the \"Prinz Georg\" Fusilier Regiment Nr. 108, Wilsdorf was promoted to lead a company in the Royal Saxon Army's 2nd J\u00e4ger Battalion, and his military career was underway. Following stints as a battalion commander, Wilsdorf was transferred to Dresden to replace Otto von Tettenborn as Commandant of the Saxon Cadet Corps. He then moved up to the Saxon War Ministry to serve as head of the Department for Personnel Affairs for then next seven years, going on active reserve status about one year prior to the outbreak of the Great War.Karl Viktor von Wilsdorf.
