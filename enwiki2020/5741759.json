    "text": "The Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance du Qu\u00e9bec, or RIQ, is an association of citizens in favour of Quebec independence. Founded in May 2000, it is purposely unaffiliated officially with any political party (like the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, the main Quebec independence party) or any political ideology outside sovereignty matters (despite the important links between the Quebec independence movement and the Quebec left). It did however support the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the 2003 Quebec general election. It also puts independence before any association projects with Canada (see also: Pur et dur). == See also == *Quebec sovereignty movement *Pur et dur *Quebec nationalism *Quebec politics *List of active autonomist and secessionist movements ==External links== *RIQ Blog's *Official website *Related works at Vigile.net Category:Civic and political organizations of Canada Category:Secessionist organizations in Canada ",
