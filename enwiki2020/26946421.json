    "text": "The Women's Air Derby was the first official women-only air race in the United States, taking place during the 1929 National Air Races. Humorist Will Rogers referred to it as the Powder Puff Derby, the name by which the race is most commonly known. Nineteen pilots took off from Santa Monica, California on August 18, 1929 (another left the next day). Marvel Crosson died, in a crash apparently caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, but fifteen made it to Cleveland, Ohio, nine days later. == The race == === Background === During the first two decades of heavier-than-air flying, the few women fliers in the United States became acquainted with one another during air meets and air rodeos. The bonds among the top women pilots were strengthened in the first real race for female pilots\u2014the Women\u2019s Air Derby during the 1929 National Air Races and Aeronautical Exposition. Air-race promoter Cliff Henderson was the founder of the first Women\u2019s Air Derby, which he patterned after the men\u2019s transcontinental air races. (Ironically, Henderson would ban women from competing in the 1934 Bendix Trophy and National Air Races after a crash which claimed the life of pilot Florence Klingensmith in 1933.) To qualify, pilots had to have at least 100 hours of solo flight, which included a minimum 25 hours of cross-country flying (these were the same rules that applied to men competing in the National Air Races). The twenty competitors, eighteen of whom were from the United States, were: *Florence \"Pancho\" Lowe Barnes *Marvel Crosson *Amelia Earhart *Ruth Elder *Claire Mae Fahy *Edith Foltz *Mary Haizlip *Jessie Miller, an Australian *Opal Kunz *Mary von Mach *Ruth Nichols *Blanche W. Noyes *Gladys O\u2019Donnell *Phoebe Omlie *Neva Paris *Margaret Perry *Thea Rasche, a German *Louise Thaden *Evelyn \"Bobbi\" Trout *Vera Dawn Walker One of the qualifications was that the aircraft would have to have horsepower \"appropriate for a woman.\" Opal Kunz's 300-horsepower Travel Air was deemed to be \"too fast for a woman to fly\" (even though she owned and flew it), so she had to find a less powerful aircraft to race. === Route === The pilots, fourteen in the heavy plane class (with engines from 510-875 cubic in.) and six in the lighter class (275-510 cubic in.), took off from Santa Monica, California. Stops en route to Cleveland included San Bernardino, California; Yuma, Arizona; Phoenix, Arizona; Douglas, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Pecos, Texas; Midland, Texas; Abilene, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. At each stop, the pilots often overnighted for refueling, repairs, and to be treated to media attention and dinner banquets.The Powder Puff Derby \u2014 Historic Wings Flight Stories. Retrieved March 27, 2019. === Airborne === To keep all competing aircraft safely separated as they climbed to altitude, they were lined up in rows at the start of the race and took off at one-minute intervals, the lighter aircraft first. National Aeronautic Association official Joe Nikrent was the official timekeeper. Earhart had an electrical problem and had to return to the airfield, but repairs were made quickly, and she resumed flying. Marvel Crosson crashed in the Gila River Valley and was killed, apparently the victim of carbon monoxide poisoning. There was a public outcry demanding the race be canceled, but the pilots got together and decided the most fitting tribute would be to finish the derby. Blanche Noyes had to put out a fire that erupted in mid-air over Pecos, but continued on. (In the 2010 documentary Breaking Through the Clouds: The First Women's National Air Derby, Noyes, a non-smoker, explained that she found a cigarette butt in her baggage compartment.) Margaret Perry caught typhoid fever. Pancho Barnes crashed into a car that drove onto the runway as she was trying to land, wrecking her airplane. Ruth Nichols also crashed. Claire Fahy's wing wires were eaten through, possibly sabotaged with acid; she withdrew from the race. An estimated 18,000 people gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, to greet the pilots at the end of the race. Louise Thaden finished the race first and won the heavy class in a time of 20 hours, 19 minutes and 4 seconds. Phoebe Omlie won the light class in 25 hours, 12 minutes and 47.5 seconds. ===Standings=== Heavy class: #Louise Thaden #Gladys O\u2019Donnell #Amelia Earhart #Blanche Noyes #Ruth Elder #Neva Paris #Mary Haizlip #Opal Kunz #Mary von Mach #Vera Dawn Walker Four women completed the race in the light class (order unclear, other than Omlie finishing first): *Phoebe Omlie *Edith Foltz *Jessie Keith-Miller *Thea Rasche Bobbi Trout finished the race, but was untimed. ==Depictions== The race was the subject of the 1935 novel Women in the Wind: A Novel of the Women's National Air Derby by Francis Walton and the 1939 film adaptation, starring Kay Francis. The book The Powder Puff Derby of 1929: The First All Women's Transcontinental Air Race, written by Gene Nora Jessen, was published in 2002. The 2010 documentary Breaking through the Clouds: The First Women's National Air Derby covers the race from inception through conclusion, includes interviews with some surviving relatives of pilots, and offers short biographies of some of the women. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ASIN: B0084PL9E4 * ==External links== *Photographs of the derby and participants in the Saint Louis University Digital Collections Category:August 1929 sports events Category:Air races * Category:American female aviators ",
