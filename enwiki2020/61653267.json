(2015). == Author == Hillel Bakis' books deal with topics related to Judaism and Jewish traditions (exegesis and liturgy, grammar, folklore, oral literature, etc.).The international documentary organization WorldCat Identities (VIAF and ICCN) indicates the following themes: \u00ab Commentaries, Criticism, Interpretation, History, Prayers and Devotion, Sources, Sacred Books, Biography \u00bb http://www.worldcat.org/identities/viaf-76498480/; http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n94010354/ . His writings demonstrate the will to transmit Judaism and its traditions through a pedagogy adapted for each age (fables, tales and novel, exegesis) with an interest in the grammar and rabbinic interpretation methods of the biblical text (the \"toolbox\" provided by the oral Torah to allow access to the written Torah).Cohen N. (2019); CDOL, 2011) ===Tales, fables === Bakis has collected and rewritten tales and fables, contributing to the identification and preservation of oral narrative traditions and Jewish folklore, particularly that of the North AfricaSee his presentation of this literature (https://editionsbakish.com/contes-et-recits-juifs-dafrique-du-nord- anthologie/fables-preface/. See his books: 1990; 2000a;, 2000c; 2000d, 2005b.. Bakis's fables depict animals (including those of the fox and the wolf), as told by masters of the Talmud.See: 2000b Some of the tales are on the style of the One Thousand and One Nights.See especially: 2005b Others trace important facts about the life of Rabbis from past centuries and scenes of daily life in Maghreb: faith, pilgrimages, but also a wonderful atmosphere. where the miracle comes to rub shoulders with banal situations of existence \"(G. Touaty 2005).One commentator of Bakis's books believes that through this anthology,\" we will understand that the miracle as it is perceived in the Jewish tradition is not a free phenomenon. He always has a moral dimension ... \"(G. Touaty 2005) ===Exegesis and the rabbinic methodology=== Hillel Bakis is the author of a five-volume commentary on the Pentateuch, \"The Voice of Jacob (\u05d4\u05e7\u05dc \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1)\", which has been reported as \"a great commentary, interesting and profound\" (R 'H. Kahn, 2015a) and \"the very high quality of his work \"was noted (G. Touaty, 2011). His commentary on biblical prophets \"Understand the haftara\" \"was equally well received (G. Touaty, 2018). These books have received \"an exceptional and unanimous welcome from the rabbinical world\" (L. Bibas, 2017) as evidenced, for example, by the Rav Zecharia Zermati who speaks of \"master stroke\"Rav Zecharia Zermati, \"Haskama to \"The voice of Jacob\", Tome Berechit, p. XV-XVI and Rav R. Y. Dufour.\"A solid work that has its place in any library by the number of comments it gathers. He has received many high rabbinical recommendations \"(2014). This can also be seen by reading the numerous approvals (\"haskamot\") published at the beginning of the various works, as is the custom for rabbinic literature. This commentary was supplemented by two methodological books: one on rabbinic methods of oral Torah interpretation (2013f), and the other on grammatical foundations (2013g). With is book on the longest of 'the Psalms (To read the Psalms, 2014) \"the author surprises with the comment about his commentary: he approaches the grammatical side, does not hesitate to report the other commentators and to criticize them, explains the moral significance of the verses studied, and ends up giving the reader a complete idea of the texture of the verses \"(Rav H. Kahn 2015b); \"Hillel Bakis translated each verse ... giving a precise reading of each word, taking into account its grammatical structure, while explaining it\" (G. Touaty, 2015). Hillel Bakis extended his commentary on the Pentateuch with a series of books on the Prophets, designed to enlighten the understanding of the texts read on the synagogue services on feasts, fasts, and chabbats (2017, 2018a, 2018b, 2019). === Liturgy === In his methodological book on the reading of the Psalms, Bakis gives details of the cantillation of poetic books (Psalms), distinct from that of the prosodic books (Pentateuch, Prophets, etc.).2014. In his series \"Understanding the haftara\", on the prophets, it specifies the customs of reading of the different communities.2017, 2018a. His study on the new-year trees (Tu bishvat), he gives details on the different customs and the complete \u2018seder\u2019 of the celebration.\"Studies and Haggadah of Tou BiChevat\", 2009e, XIV-282 p .; http://hebrewbooks.org/42889; http://www.toratemet.net/image/users/21292/ftp/my_files/-Hillel-3.pdf . ===Novel=== In his novel \"The Messiah is late!\" (Bakis 2000d), Hillel Bakis constructs a plot with social and technological mutations as background (Dov d'Acco 2010).\"Francophones of Galilee\", Reading No. 11. The action begins in the year 6000 of the Jewish calendar, the last date at which the Messiah must appear. A detective goes back in the past to understand why the Messiah has not yet manifested himself. This is probably the only science-fiction novel written by a North African Jew in the twentieth century.Guy Dugas noted in his thesis that the genre \"science fiction\" was probably the only literary genre that had not been invested by the Jews of North Africa (\"Judeo-Maghreb Literature of French Expression\", L'Harmattan, Paris, 1991). However, he did not carry out the census of the last decade of the twentieth century == Editor and Publisher== Hillel Bakis chairs the Institute Isaiah Bakish dedicated to a rabbi-judge of the 16th century, he founded in 1987.
