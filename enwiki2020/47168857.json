Born in Cerbu, Arge\u0219 County, her parents were Ion Ionescu, a small-scale tradesman, and his wife Maria (n\u00e9e Niculescu). She attended middle and high school in Pite\u0219ti from 1911 to 1919. In 1924, she graduated from the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest, with a major in French. Subsequently, she was hired as a civil servant at the Ministry of Public Instruction. She was married to the writer Felix Aderca. Her literary debut came in 1916, in Universul newspaper, with the anti-World War I poem \"8 octombrie\". She attracted notice from Eugen Lovinescu, to whom she owed both her pseudonym and her work being published in Sbur\u0103torul from 1921. Her first prose writing, Pata de umbr\u0103, appeared in Sbur\u0103torul literar in 1922; the same literary magazine also ran her pieces Via\u021ba, Cel din urm\u0103 vis and G\u00e2nduri. Her first book was the 1925 volume of poetry Crinii ro\u0219ii. Other magazines that published her work: Curierul artelor, Lumea copiilor, Vremea, Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale, Adev\u0103rul literar \u0219i artistic, Veac nou, Flac\u0103ra, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103 and Luceaf\u0103rul.

Throughout, she used her vivid imagination to draw clear, lifelike portraits of the past.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. II, p. 150-51.
