Both games featured the College of the Pacific (now University of the Pacific), who defeated Utah State in 1947, and played Hardin\u2013Simmons to a tie in 1948. Like some other postseason match-ups of the era, such as the Glass Bowl and the Optimist Bowl, results are listed in NCAA records, but the games were not considered NCAA-sanctioned bowls. ==Game results== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
