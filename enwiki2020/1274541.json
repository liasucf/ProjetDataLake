    "text": "Szyma\u0144ski (feminine: Szyma\u0144ska, plural Szyma\u0144scy) is the ninth most common surname in Poland with about 114 075 people (0.3% of Polish population) sharing it by 2015. ==Etymology== The name Szyma\u0144ski is of Polish origin. The name is derived from the personal name \"Szymon\" and the characteristic Slavic suffix \"-ski\", meaning \"son of\". Thus, the name Szyma\u0144ski means \"son of Szymon\". This surname was originally derived from the Hebrew personal name SHIMON, and in many vernacular versions of the Old Testament the name is usually rendered as SIMEON. In the New Testament, however, the name is normally rendered as Simon, partly as a result of an association with the Greek byname SIMOS, meaning snub-nosed. The name has spread to England, France, Germany, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the U.S.A., and the name has been in use as a given name in Western Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. The name was no doubt popular because of its associations with the apostle Simon Peter, the brother of Andrew. In Britain, there was confusion from an early date with the Anglo-Scandinavian form of Sigmund, a name whose popularity was reinforced at the time of the Norman Conquest of 1066, by the Norman form of Simmund. ==Notable people== * Adam Szyma\u0144ski, Polish writer * Antoni Szyma\u0144ski, Polish Army general * Beata Szyma\u0144ska, Polish poet and writer * Boleslaw Szymanski, computer scientist * Damian Szyma\u0144ski, Polish footballer * Frank Szymanski, football player * Grzegorz Szyma\u0144ski, Polish volleyball player * Halina Szyma\u0144ska, Polish spy * Henry Szymanski, American wrestler * Ignacy Szyma\u0144ski, Polish soldier * Jake Toranzo Szymanski, film & TV actor * Jakub Szyma\u0144ski, Polish volleyball player * Jakub Szymanski, Czech handball player * Jan Szyma\u0144ski, Polish speed skater * Jan Szyma\u0144ski, Polish wrestler * J\u00f3zef Szyma\u0144ski, Polish bobsledder * Karol Szyma\u0144ski, Polish footballer * Konrad Szyma\u0144ski, Polish politician * Krystyna Szyma\u0144ska-Lara, Polish basketball player * Marcin Szyma\u0144ski, Polish footballer * Marija \u0160imanska, Latvian chemist * Pawe\u0142 Szyma\u0144ski, Polish composer * Roman Szyma\u0144ski, Polish political activist * Timothy Szymanski, a United States Navy Flag Officer ==References== Category:Polish-language surnames Category:Patronymic surnames ",
