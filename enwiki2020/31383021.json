This campus is in the northern area of Mexico City, in the borough of Azcapotzalco. It is one of the three campi built shortly after Mexican President Luis Echeverr\u00eda decreed the foundation of Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana in 1974. == History == The creation of Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana was a response to the increasing demand for public higher education in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, which by those years was undergoing severe demographic changes due to a process of conurbation that started in the early 1940s. The main idea was to cope with the demand for this service throughout the outskirts of the metropolitan area, locating the university's campi in the outlying boroughs. Following this principle, UAM Azcapotzalco was one of the first three campi built between 1974 and 1975, along with UAM Xochimilco and UAM Iztapalapa. == Undergraduate studies == UAM Azcapotzalco hosts 17 majors, lasting between 12 and 15 quarter-terms or four and five years respectively.
