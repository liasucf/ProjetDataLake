    "text": "Alarms & Clock (originally known as Clock & Alarms on Pocket PC 2000 and Alarms on Windows 8.1) is a time management application included with Windows and Windows 10 Mobile with four key features: alarms, world clocks, timers, and a stopwatch. The features are listed on a wireframe ribbon menu. The app is similar in functionality and design to the Clock app on iOS. Alarms & Clock was available on mobile devices for over a decade before it was available on PCs with the introduction of Windows 8.1. Tiles for alarms, timers, and the stopwatch can be pinned to the Start menu. The latest version of the app uses the Universal Windows Platform APIs and uses the system's setting for light or dark theming. Alarms & Clock is not integrated with the taskbar clock. ==Alarms== The alarms are listed vertically by time of day and can be activated or deactivated with an ovular on/off switch. It is possible to delete a selection of alarms simultaneously by clicking on the list button and using the control key with or without the shift key to select alarms. Alarms can be created by clicking the plus button and edited by clicking or tapping on them. It is possible to change the time, name, recurrence by day of the week, sound, and snooze time. The current list of sounds in the order listed is Chimes, Xylophone, Chords, Tap, Jingle, Transition, Descending, Bounce, Echo, and Ascending. Alarms are triggered by a special type of toast notification for alarms. Due to hardware limitations, alarms cannot always appear on certain devices that are powered off. In order for an alarm to ring on a PC that is off, InstantGo must be included in the device. Prior to the Windows 10 Creators Update, Alarms & Clock was the only app that could make an alarm notification appear during quiet hours, but third-party alarms running on Windows 10 version 1704 or later also ring during quiet hours by default. ==World Clock== The world clock list detects the user's location and shows the local time on the user's location on a world map. Users can search for additional locations to show on the map. When other times are displayed, the World Clock feature calculates how far ahead or behind the other times are from the user's local time. It is also possible to compare what nonlocal times will be at a specified local time. When the map is minimized horizontally, the times are shown in a vertical list below the map instead of on it. Users who would simply like a window with an easily visible clock can type timedate.cpl in the Run dialog box (). ==Timer== Timers can be created and named by clicking the plus button at the bottom, like alarms; however, there is no way to edit a timer. It is possible to reset or delete a timer. Multiple timers can be set to run simultaneously. The zoom button on a timer replaces the background with the Windows accent colors, hides other timers and the ribbon, and enlarges the time shown. Arrow navigation buttons allow users to switch between timers in this view. Timers provide notifications when they end. They cannot be reset from the notifications. ==Stopwatch== One stopwatch may be run at a time. A flag button allows the user to record lap times and a share button allows users to share times with other UWP apps. Similarly to timers, the stopwatch has a resize button that simplifies the interface by changing the background and hiding the lap values. ==References== Category:Windows software ",
