    "text": "In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 20\u201320\u201320 club is the group of batters who have collected 20 doubles, 20 triples and 20 home runs in a single season. Frank Schulte was the first to achieve this, doing so in 1911. The last players to reach the milestone \u2013 Curtis Granderson and Jimmy Rollins \u2013 attained 20\u201320\u201320 during the 2007 season. This marked the first time that two players accomplished the achievement in the same season. In total, seven players are members of the 20\u201320\u201320 club. Of these, five were left-handed batters, one was right-handed and one was a switch hitter, meaning he could bat from either side of the plate. Two players \u2013 George Brett and Willie Mays \u2013 are also members of the 3,000 hit club, and Mays is also a member of the 500 home run club. Schulte, Rollins, and Jim Bottomley won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 20\u201320\u201320 season. Both Mays and Rollins joined the club while also hitting 30 home runs and stealing 30 bases that same season to join the 30\u201330 club. Brett and Rollins collected more than 200 hits alongside achieving 20\u201320\u201320. Furthermore, four players amassed 20 or more stolen bases during their 20\u201320\u201320 season. These players are collectively referred to as the 20\u201320\u201320\u201320 club. Historically, there have been numerous players who have hit 20 doubles and 20 home runs in a year. It is the component of triples, however, that makes the 20\u201320\u201320 club so difficult to achieve. This is because hitting triples often comes under a similar hit placement as doubles, but may require impressive speed on the part of the runner. This would pose a challenge for both a slugger, who may be slower at running the bases and have the tendency to hit line drives and fly balls out of the park for a home run, as well as a speedster, who may be more swift around the bases but may not supply much power to drive the ball far. Due to the rare occurrence and low membership of the 20\u201320\u201320 club, Baseball Digest called it \"the most exclusive club in the Majors\" in 1979, when there were only four members. Of the five members eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame, three have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave 2 players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons. ==Members== alt=Black-and-white photo of Willie Mays, smiling in a San Francisco Giants hat alt=George Brett, wearing a white Kansas City Royals home jersey, prepares to bat {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Key !scope=\"row\"|Year |The year the player's 20\u201320\u201320 season occurred |- !scope=\"row\"|Player |Name of the player |- !scope=\"row\"|Team |The player's team for his 20\u201320\u201320 season |- !scope=\"row\"|2B |Number of doubles in that year |- !scope=\"row\"|3B |Number of triples in that year |- !scope=\"row\"|HR |Number of home runs in that year |- !scope=\"row\"|SB |Number of stolen bases in that year |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color: #ffffbb\"| |Elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Members of the 20\u201320\u201320 club !scope=\"col\"|Year !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Team !scope=\"col\"|2B !scope=\"col\"|3B !scope=\"col\"|HR !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Chicago Cubs||30||21||21|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"| |St. Louis Cardinals||42||20||31|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Cleveland Indians||32||20||24|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"| |New York Giants||26||20||35|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"| |Kansas City Royals||42||20||23|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Detroit Tigers||38||23||23|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Philadelphia Phillies||38||20||30|| |} ===20\u201320\u201320\u201320 club=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Members of the 20\u201320\u201320\u201320 club !scope=\"col\"|Year !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Team !scope=\"col\"|2B !scope=\"col\"|3B !scope=\"col\"|HR !scope=\"col\"|SB !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Chicago Cubs||30||21||21||23|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"| |New York Giants||26||20||35||38|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Detroit Tigers||38||23||23||26|| |- | !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |Philadelphia Phillies||38||20||30||41|| |} ==See also== * 40\u201340 club, similar multiple stat club for home runs and stolen bases. * Baseball statistics * Triple Crown ==References== Category:Major League Baseball lists Category:Major League Baseball statistics ",
