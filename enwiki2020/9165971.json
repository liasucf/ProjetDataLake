    "text": "The 1947 FA Cup Final was the 66th final of the FA Cup. It took place on 26 April 1947 at Wembley Stadium and was contested between Charlton Athletic and Burnley. Charlton were appearing in their second consecutive final after losing to Derby County the previous year, while Second Division Burnley were appearing in their first final since 1914. Charlton won the match 1\u20130 after extra time, with Chris Duffy scoring the winning goal. For the second consecutive year, the ball burst during the match; both incidents were later put down to the poor quality of leather available after World War II. ==Route to the final== ===Charlton=== *Third round: 4\u20131 v Rochdale (home) *Fourth round: 2\u20131 v West Brom (away) *Fifth round: 1\u20130 v Blackburn (home) *Quarter- finals: 2\u20131 v Preston (home) *Semi-finals: 4\u20130 v Newcastle (neutral) ===Burnley=== *Third round: 5\u20131 v Aston Villa (home) *Fourth round: 2\u20130 v Coventry (home) *Fifth round: 3\u20130 v Luton (home) *Quarter-finals: 1\u20131 v Middlesbrough (away) \u2013 Replay 1\u20130 (home) *Semi-finals: 0\u20130 v Liverpool (neutral) \u2013 Replay 1\u20130 (neutral) ==Match details== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%;\" |- | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Sam Bartram |- |RB ||2 || Peter Croker |- |LB ||3 || Jack Shreeve |- |RH ||4 || Herbert Johnson |- |CH ||5 || Harold Phipps |- |LH ||6 || Bill Whittaker |- |OR ||7 || Gordon Hurst |- |IR ||8 || Tommy Dawson |- |CF ||9 || William Robinson |- |IL ||10|| Don Welsh (c) |- |OL ||11|| Chris Duffy |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Jimmy Seed |} | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto;\" |- |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || George Strong |- |RB ||2 || Arthur Woodruff |- |LB ||3 || Harry Mather |- |RH ||4 || Reg Attwell |- |CH ||5 || Alan Brown (c) |- |LH ||6 || George Bray |- |OR ||7 || Jackie Chew |- |IR ||8 || Billy Morris |- |CF ||9 || Ray Harrison |- |IL ||10|| Harry Potts |- |OL ||11|| Peter Kippax |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Cliff Britton |} |} ==External links== *Match report *Team list at Soccerbase *FA Cup Final kits 1946\u201349 Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final FA Cup Final 1947 FA Cup Final 1947 FA Cup Final 1947 FA Cup Final ",
