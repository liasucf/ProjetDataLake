    "text": "The British Society for the History of Mathematics (BSHM) was founded in 1971 to promote research into the history of mathematics at all levels and to further the use of the history of mathematics in education. The BSHM is concerned with all periods and cultures, and with all aspects of mathematics. It participates in the Joint Mathematical Council of the United Kingdom. The Society's journal, the British Journal for the History of Mathematics, is published on behalf of BSHM by Taylor & Francis.BJHM https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tbsh20 == Neumann Prize == The Neumann prize is awarded biennially by the BSHM for \"a book in English (including books in translation) dealing with the history of mathematics and aimed at a broad audience.\"Neumann prize The prize was named in honour of Peter M. Neumann, who is a longstanding supporter of and contributor to the society.
