It is situated 22 kilometres from Erode and an important junction on SH 37 en route to Palani and other important small towns like Kodumudi and Chennimalai. Demographics India census, Arachalur had a population of 12,313. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Arachalur has an average literacy rate of 59.4%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with 57% of the males and 43% of females literate. 8% of the population is under 6 years of age. *There is one Arts and Science college for women: Navarasam Arts and Science college. *The Government Higher Secondary School placed in first rank in the Erode district in academic category.

The people have good relationships with each other and greet all the people gracefully. ==Jain Inscriptions== There are three 2nd century C.E. Jain inscriptions in Arachalur, which Dr. S. Raju discovered. On a Jain bed in the Arachalur hills, is an inscription \u2014 \u2018ezhuthum punaruthan maniya vannakkan devan sathan.\u2019 The word \u2018punaruthan\u2019 is an alteration of punarthan, which means organised. The other two inscriptions have musical syllables, which are the same when read from left to right, and vice versa; they are also the same when read from the top of a column to the bottom and vice versa. These two inscriptions show that 'Maniyan Vannakkan Devan Sathan' organised musical syllables. \u201cThis inscription, which belongs to the same period as Silappadikaram, is centuries older than the 'Kudumiyamalai inscriptions' on music, and yet the Arachalur inscription hardly draws visitors,\u201d rues Dr.S. Raju. Dr. S. Raju says that the contribution of Kongu Jains to Tamil was immense. \u201cKonguvelir, who wrote Perunkathai, based on Durvineetha\u2019s Brihatkatha, must have been a Kongu Vellala Jain. A Sanskrit inscription in the Vijayamangalam Jain temple, talks of the beauty of Perunkathai. This temple was built in 678 C.E. So Konguvelir must have lived in Vijayamangalam around this time.\u201d == Arachalai Amman Temple == This ( Padai Vettum Pathrakali ) temple was built by O. S. Duraisamy Gounder, Kottarathottam. Annual festival comes in April\u2013May months to bring Joy and wealth to the people of this village. The festival has the famous Pookuzhi, manchal neerattu (Turmeric water Abhishek), temple car and other common ceremonies/functions. == Nagamalai Andavar Temple == This Nagamalai temple is located at Thalavumalai known as Nagarajapuram; present temple was built by O.S.Duraiswamy Gounder and others. This temple has historical traces of carving in a small mountain range. There is a festival which is celebrated in the month of March known as panguni uthiram . On that day, around 10,000 persons are provided with free meals. == Isai Kalvettu (Music inscription) == In this 'Thalavumalai' small mountain, there is a music inscription, in Tamil Brahmi letters; this is the oldest kallvettu (inscription)-( Fourth Century A.D ). This Thalavumalai is presently known as Nagarajapuram. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Erode district ",
