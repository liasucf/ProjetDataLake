She was married to Peter Kirillovich Razumovsky, and the mistress of Paul I of Russia prior to his marriage, with whom she had a son, Semen Velikiy (1772-1794). ==Life== Sophia Razumovskaya was born to Stephan Fedorovich Ushakov and Anna Semenovna. She was appointed maid-of-honour to Catherine the Great. She married Mikhail Petrovich Chertoryzhsky, but was early widowed. She participated in the social life of the court and was known for her vivacious life style. Pending the plans to have Grand Duke Paul married, there were concerns as to whether he was sexually capable to have an heir, and Sophia was asked to investigate his sexual function by seducing him. \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0445, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043e\u0432. \u2014 \u041d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440-\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2003. \u2014 \u0421. 41. \u2014 194 \u0441. She succeeded with her task and had a son with him, Semen Velikiy (1772-1794), whose upbringing was provided by the empress. Paul married in 1773, and in 1776, Sophia remarried count Peter Kirillovich Razumovskiy, son of fieldmarchal Kirill Grigorievich Razumovsky. As her father-in-law protested and expressed his dislike of the marriage, it was likely not arranged, and the marriage is described as happy. == References == * \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b. \u043a\u043d. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044b XVIII \u0438 XIX \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439. \u0422.3.\u0412\u044b\u043f.3. \u2116 110 Category:1746 births Category:1803 deaths Category:18th-century Russian people Category:Russian ladies-in-waiting Category:Mistresses of Russian royalty Category:Burials at Lazarevskoe Cemetery (Saint Petersburg) ",
