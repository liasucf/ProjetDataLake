It is based on the story of biblical character Jezebel. The series stars Lidi Lisboa as the titular character. == Plot == After an agreement between two kingdoms, a disguised Jezabel marries Prince Acabe and becomes the most dangerous queen of Israel. Taking advantage of the weak and submissive profile of her husband, she starts to rule the kingdom with violence and manipulates everyone around her, calling herself a great priestess and divine spokesman, in addition to resorting to violence and public sacrifices to show her power. She has allies including her lover Hannibal and her best friend, Thanit, a vain and ambitious woman, who influences Jezebel with more barbaric plans. The queen's greatest enemy is the prophet Elias, who attempts to unmask her and remove the queen from power with the help of various allies. This causes Jezabel to hire the nymphet Dido to seduce Eliseu, disciple of Elias, to discover his plans. Also in the fight against the queen is Obadias, administrator of the palace who works as a spy and tries to hide the prophets. == Cast == === Main === * Lidi Lisboa as Jezabel, Rainha de Israel * Andr\u00e9 Bankoff as Acabe, King of Israel * M\u00f4nica Carvalho as Thanit * Iano Salom\u00e3o as Elias * Juan Alba as Obadias Rakesh * Ronny Kriwat as Eliseu Yak * Juliana Xavier as Dido * Juliana Knust as Queila * Tim\u00f3teo Heiderick as Barzilai * Rafael Sard\u00e3o as Hannibal * Sthefany Brito as Raquel Palho\u00e7a * Guilherme Dellorto as Mica\u00edas * Alexandre Slaviero as Baltazar * Bernardo Velasco as Matheus * Leonardo Miggiorin as Isaac * Adriana Birolli as Aisha * Hylka Maria as Get\u00falia * Fl\u00e1vio Galv\u00e3o as Nabote Vina * Eduardo Lago as Phineas Yak * Narjara Turetta as Dalila Yak * Juliana Boller as Hannah Yak * Victor Sparapane as Tadeu Vina * Daniel Blanco as Abner Vina * Henri Pagnocelli as Emanuel Palho\u00e7a * Andr\u00e9a Avancini as Yarin Palho\u00e7a * Brendha Haddad as Anaid * Juliana Schalch as Temina * Daniel Erthal as Thiago * Dudu Pelizzari as Kaleb * L\u00e9o Cidade as Levi * B\u00e1rbara Maia as Leah * Ricardo Pav\u00e3o as Pigmale\u00e3o * Fernando Sampaio as Uriel * Igor Cosso as Miguel * La\u00eds Pinho as Samira Rakesh * Camila Mayrink as Joana Rakesh * Fernanda Nizzato as Adama * Pedro Lamin as Sid\u00f4nio * Aline Prado as Batnoam * Alex Brasil as Jarbas * Andr\u00e9 Bicudo as Yakir * Jo\u00e3o Pedro Novaes as Adad * Gabriel Felipe as Ezri * F\u00e1bio Scalon as Ib * Luckas Moura as Noam * Willian Mello as Samuel ===Guest stars=== * Samara Felippo as Tany * Talita Castro as Rebeca * Beth Zalcman as Elza Vina * Gutto Ordoz as Benyamin * Andrey Lopes as Dov * Armando Amaral as Gilad * Cassio do Nascimento as Cadmo * Edu Porto as Jaali * Luciano Quirino as Etbaal * Mario Hermeto as Joel * Patrick D'Orlando as Tobias == Ratings == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Timeslot (BRT/AMT) ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" | Episodes ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | First aired ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Last aired |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Viewers (in points) ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Viewers (in points) |- | 1 | MonFri 8:45pm | 80 | | 10 | | 9 |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:2019 telenovelas Category:Brazilian television series Category:Brazilian telenovelas Category:RecordTV telenovelas Category:2019 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2019 Brazilian television series endings Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas Category:Television series based on the Bible ",
