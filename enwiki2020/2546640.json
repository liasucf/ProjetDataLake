    "text": "WINK-TV, virtual channel 11 (UHF digital channel 31), is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Fort Myers, Florida, United States and also serving Naples and Cape Coral. The station is owned by the McBride family and their Fort Myers Broadcasting Company, making it one of a handful of TV stations today to have locally-based ownership. Fort Myers Broadcasting also operates three Naples-licensed stations under a shared services agreement (SSA) with owner Sun Broadcasting: CW affiliate WXCW (channel 46), low-powered Univision affiliate WUVF-LD (channel 2), and low-powered Azteca Am\u00e9rica affiliate WANA-LD (channel 18). The four stations share studios on Palm Beach Boulevard (SR 80) in northeast Fort Myers; WINK-TV's transmitter is located north of Fort Myers Shores, near the Charlotte\u2013Lee county line. On cable, the station is carried on Comcast Xfinity channel 5 and in high definition on digital channel 433. ==History== The station began broadcasting on March 23, 1954, owned by the family of taxicab magnate and Cleveland Browns founder Mickey McBride along with WINK radio (1240 AM, now WAXA at 1200 AM; and 96.9 FM). WINK-TV was the first television station in Southwest Florida and is the fifth-oldest surviving station in the state. Although the call letters appear to be an outgrowth of its CBS affiliation, in fact they were simply carried over from its radio sister, which adopted them in 1944\u2014seven years before the CBS Eye made its first appearance.Station history It carried programming from the four major networks of its era: CBS, NBC, ABC and DuMont in the first two decades of its existence. However, it has always been a primary CBS affiliate. Channel 11 lost DuMont when that network ended operations in 1956. In December 1968, WINK-TV finally gained a local competitor when WBBH-TV signed on and took the NBC affiliation. The two stations continued to share ABC until WEVU- TV (now WZVN-TV) signed on in 1974. However, viewers could watch the full ABC and NBC schedules via stations from Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg, which were and continue to be available with outdoor antennas. WINK-TV was a major beneficiary of a quirk in the FCC's plan for allocating stations. In the early days of broadcast television, there were twelve VHF channels available and 69 UHF channels (later reduced to 55 in 1983). The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced. After the FCC's Sixth Report and Order ended the license freeze and opened the UHF band in 1952, it devised a plan for allocating VHF licenses. Under this plan, almost all of the country would be able to receive two commercial VHF channels plus one noncommercial channel. Most of the rest of the country (\"1/2\") would be able to receive a third VHF channel. Other areas would be designated as \"UHF islands\" since they were too close to larger cities for VHF service. The \"2\" networks became CBS and NBC, \"+1\" represented non-commercial educational stations, and \"1/2\" became ABC (which was the weakest network then usually winding up with the UHF allocation where no VHF was available). However, Fort Myers is sandwiched between Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale (channels 2, 4, 6, 7 and 10) and West Palm Beach (channels 5 and 12) to the east and Tampa Bay (channels 3, 8, 10, and 13) to the north. This created a large doughnut in southwest Florida where there could be only one VHF license. WINK-TV was fortunate to gain that license, and as a result was the only local station that provided a clear picture to outlying portions of the market until cable television arrived in the mid-1970s. Although there was no station on channel 9 in the immediate area, it was occupied in Orlando, which was too close to Fort Myers to reallocate. The station has identified almost exclusively with its call letters since the mid-1980s. This is due in large part to the extremely high penetration of cable and satellite in Southwest Florida\u2014one of the highest in the nation. Cable and satellite are all but essential for acceptable television reception in much of the market, even in the digital age. On October 20, 2007, WINK-TV became the first television station in Southwest Florida to begin broadcasting in high definition. In January 2008, several programming changes were made on WINK-TV. It began airing The Early Show (which was replaced by CBS This Morning in January 2012) in its entirety after CBS began requiring all of its affiliates to air the full two-hour broadcast of the program. WINK has been digital-only since February 17, 2009. It moved its digital signal to UHF channel 50 in mid-2011.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1353988&Service;=DT&Form;_id=301&Facility;_id=22093 On May 26, 2011, WINK-TV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, one of many added on television stations around the United States on that date to replace The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ended its 25-year run the day before.In Fort Myers, WINK Replacing \u2018Oprah\u2019 with Newscast, Media Bistro, April 29, 2011.
