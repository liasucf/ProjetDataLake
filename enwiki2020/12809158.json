    "text": "The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) is a multi-day mathematical modelling competition held annually in USA, during the first or second weekend in February, since 1985 by COMAP and sponsored by SIAM, the NSA, and INFORMS. It is distinguished from other major mathematical competitions such as Putnam by its strong focus on research, originality, teamwork, communication and justification of results. It runs concurrently with the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). == Problems == At the beginning of the contest, teams have a choice between two problems. Problem A involves a system that requires the use of continuous mathematics, and thus often involves concepts from geometry, physics, or engineering. Problem B involves a system that requires the use of discrete mathematics. In 2016, a \"data insights\" problem was added, where teams are given access to database files and tasked with using them to answer a question.https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/flyer/MCM-Problem-C- Overview.pdf This problem was designated as Problem C, though previously, Problem C referred to an ICM problem. These problems tend to be open-ended, and are drawn from all fields of science, business, and public policy. Past problems include * Estimate the global effects of a large asteroid impacting Antarctica (1999 A) * Study the hunting strategies of velociraptor dinosaurs based on fossil data (1997 A) * Develop a more efficient method of boarding passengers onto large commercial jets (2007 B) Teams have 96 hours to research and submit their solutions in the form of a research paper. During this time, they may consult any available references, but may not discuss their problem with anyone outside their teams. Several guides containing advice and recommendations for teams and/or advisors have been published online or in print.http://amath.colorado.edu/uploads/event_docs/mcm_guide.pdf Published in MAA FOCUS vol 26 #6, August/September 2006, pp.22-23 == Participation and awards == Thousands of international teams of three undergraduates compete to produce original mathematical papers in response to one of two modeling problems. Initially, participation was largely from the United States, however in recent years international participation has grown significantly, particularly from the People's Republic of China, so that in 2007 teams from the United States comprised only 24% of total participation. In 2014, the percentage of teams from the People's Republic of China reached a record high of 92.9%. After the competition, all papers are judged and placed into the following categories: * Unsuccessful Participant * Successful Participant (approximately 40% of teams) * Honorable Mention (approximately 25% of teams) * Meritorious Winner (usually 10 to 15% of teams) * Finalist (approximately 1% of teams) * Outstanding Winner (less than .5% of teams) Until 2009, Outstanding Winner papers were published in The UMAP Journal. == Results == === 2015 === * 7636 teams participated * Problem A Outstanding Winners ** Northwestern Polytechnical University, China ** State University of New York, University at Buffalo, NY \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient ** Chongqing University, China \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Central South University, China \u2014 Ben Fusaro Award ** University of Adelaide, Australia \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient * Problem B Outstanding Winners ** University of Colorado Boulder, CO \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient & Two Sigma Scholarship Award ** Bethel University, MN \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient & Frank Giordano Award ** University of Colorado Boulder, CO ** Colorado College, CO \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient ** Tsinghua University, China === 2014 === * 6755 teams participated * Problem A Outstanding Winners ** Shanghai Jiaotong University, China ** Tsinghua University, China \u2014 INFORMS & Ben Fusaro Award ** Nanjing University, China ** Zhejiang University, China\u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Beijing Normal University, China ** Tufts University, MA \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient * Problem B Outstanding Winners ** Chongqing University, China ** University of International Business and Economics, China ** Southeast University, China ** Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China \u2014 Frank Giordano Award ** Southwest University for Nationalities, China \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** College of Information Science and Engineering; Northeastern University, China ** NC School of Science and Mathematics, NC \u2014 INFORMS & MAA Prize Recipient === 2013 === * 5636 teams participated * Problem A Outstanding Winners ** Bethel University, MN \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient ** Fudan University, China ** Peking University, China ** Shandong University, China \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient ** Shanghai Jiaotong University, China ** University of Colorado Boulder, CO \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Tongji University, China \u2014 Ben Fusaro Award (Finalist) * Problem B Outstanding Winners ** Beijing Univ. of Posts and Telecomm, China ** Colorado College, CO \u2014 Frank Giordano Award ** Nanjing University, China \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient ** Tsinghua University, China \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** University of Colorado Boulder, CO \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient === 2012=== * 3697 teams participated * Problem A Outstanding Winners ** Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong ** National University of Singapore, Singapore \u2014 Ben Fusaro Award ** Shanghai Foreign Language School, China \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient ** Zhejiang University, China \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Cornell University, NY \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient (Finalist) * Problem B Outstanding Winners ** Bethel University, MN ** Peking University, China ** University of Colorado, CO \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient ** University of Colorado, CO \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient ** University of Louisville, KY \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Western Washington University, WA \u2014 Frank Giordano Award === 2011=== * 2775 teams participated * Problem A Outstanding Winners ** Eastern Oregon University, OR \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient ** Peking University, China ** Tsinghua University, China \u2014SIAM Prize Recipient ** University of Western Ontario, Canada \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient & Ben Fusaro Award * Problem B Outstanding Winners ** Harvey Mudd College, CA \u2014 SIAM Prize Recipient ** Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, NY ** University of Electronic Science and Technology, China \u2014 INFORMS Prize Recipient & Ben Fusaro Award ** Virginia Tech, VA \u2014 MAA Prize Recipient == See also == * Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling * International Mathematical Modeling Challenge ==References== == External links == * Official contest website Category:Mathematics competitions Category:Recurring events established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in the United States ",
