An active member of the Menshevik party, he led the 1905 revolution in Guria (\"Gurian Republic\"), a Georgian province on the Black Sea. He became a de facto head of the peasant government, sometimes described by the contemporary observers as a \"Gurian president\" or even \"Gurian king\".Stephen F. Jones (2005), Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, p. 149. Harvard University Press, . During the short-lived independent Democratic Republic of Georgia, he served as a mayor of Tiflis, the capital of Georgia (1919\u20131920). After the Soviet invasion of Georgia, he immigrated to France, where he became an official owner of the Leuville chateau, a residence of the Georgian government-in-exile. He returned to Georgia in 1923 to take part in the preparations for a general uprising against the Bolshevik regime. He was arrested, however, and executed. ==References== ==External links== *(French) I\u00e8re R\u00e9publique de G\u00e9orgie. *(French) I\u00e8re R\u00e9publique de G\u00e9orgie en exil.
