    "text": "|} The Ruby Stakes is a Listed flat horse race in Ireland open to thoroughbred horses aged three years or older. It is run at Killarney over a distance of 1 mile and 20 yards (1,628 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August. The race was first run in 1997 and took place at Tralee until the racecourse was closed in 2007, and at Dundalk in 2008. Since being transferred to Killarney the race title has been extended to include the name of the legendary Irish trainer, Vincent O'Brien. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 1997 | On Fair Stage | 4 | Pat Smullen | John Oxx | 1:49.00 |- | 1998 | Lil's Boy | 4 | Kevin Manning | Jim Bolger | 1:38.90 |- | 1999 | Free To Speak | 7 | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 1:41.80 |- | 2000 | Rush Brook | 5 | Fran Berry | David Wachman | 1:48.80 |- | 2001 | One Won One | 7 | Kevin Manning | Joanna Morgan | 1:41.30 |- | 2002 | Blatant | 3 | Johnny Murtagh | John Oxx | 1:39.50 |- | 2003 | Latino Magic | 3 | Robbie Burke | Robbie Osborne | 1:40.30 |- | 2004 | Eklim | 4 | Declan McDonogh | Kevin Prendergast | 1:54.10 |- | 2005 | Common World | 6 | Seamie Heffernan | Tom Hogan | 1:44.50 |- | 2006 | Kalderon | 6 | Fran Berry | Tom Hogan | 1:37.44 |- | 2007 | Deauville Vision | 4 | Rory Cleary | Michael Halford | 1:51.20 |- | 2008 | Mystical Lady | 3 | Colm O'Donoghue | Aidan O'Brien | 1:36.50 |- | 2009 | Poet | 4 | Sean Levey | Aidan O'Brien | 1:46.06 |- | 2010 | Steinbeck | 3 | Seamie Heffernan | Aidan O'Brien | 1:41.88 |- | 2011 | Wild Wind | 3 | Colm O'Donoghue | Aidan O'Brien | 1:41.81 |- | 2012 | Soon | 3 | Seamie Heffernan | Aidan O'Brien | 1:48.80 |- | 2013 | Wannabe Better | 3 | Wayne Lordan | Tommy Stack | 1:40.75 |- | 2014 | Brooch | 3 | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 1:42.36 |- | 2015 | Algonquin | 3 | Kevin Manning | Jim Bolger | 1:41.42 |- | 2016 | Erysimum | 3 | Billy Lee | Willie McCreery | 1:42.16 |- | 2017 | Canary Row | 7 | Ronan Whelan | Patrick Prendergast | 1:46.64 |- | 2018 | I Can Fly | 3 | Seamie Heffernan | Aidan O'Brien | 1:41.70 |- | 2019 | Lady Wannabe | 3 | Chris Hayes | Fozzy Stack | 1:42.90 |- | 2020 | So Wonderful | 3 | Seamie Heffernan | Aidan O'Brien | 1:49.89 |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Ireland * List of Irish flat horse races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , **, , , * 1998 Ruby Stakes on Youtube * 1999 Ruby Stakes on Youtube * 2000 Ruby Stakes on Youtube Category:Flat races in Ireland Category:Open mile category horse races Category:Killarney Racecourse Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Ireland ",
