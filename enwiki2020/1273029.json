    "text": "Elections in Ghana gives information on election and election results in Ghana. Ghana elects on national level a head of state, the president, and a legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term by the people. The Parliament of Ghana has 275 members, elected for a four-year term in single- seat constituencies. The presidential election is won by having more than 50% of valid votes cast, whilst the parliamentary elections is won by simple majority, and, as is predicted by Duverger's law, the voting system has encouraged Ghanaian politics into a two-party system, creating extreme difficulty for anybody attempting to achieve electoral success under any banner other than those of the two dominant parties. Elections have been held every four years since 1992. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held alongside each other, generally on 7 December every four years. ==Latest elections== ===Presidential=== ===Parliamentary=== ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system * Electoral Commission of Ghana ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *African Elections Database *Ghana Elections 2008 ",
