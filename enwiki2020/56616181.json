It stands on Berryknowes Road. The cemetery has a Jewish section containing 230 graves.http://www.scottishjewishcemeteries.org/craigton/craigton.htm The cemetery also contains 251 commonwealth war graves from the First and Second World Wars. Partly due to the proximity to Ibrox Stadium, the cemetery has strong links to Rangers Football Club. The original entrance is to the south- east. A new entrance to the north was created to serve the crematorium. The north half of the cemetery is relatively flat and open. The south half slopes fairly steeply south to north and is more densely filled with monuments. Vandalism in the cemetery is widespread. ==History== The cemetery was established in 1871 by the Craigton Cemetery Company to serve south-west Glasgow, Govan and Partick. The original cemetery extended to 30 acres on lands of Wester Craigton and Merrylands, previously owned by Robert Urquhart. The main shareholder was Thomas Reid (1831-1900) of the Govan Dye Works. Fellow directors included Morris Pollok (1831-1899) and William McOnie (1813-1894) (later Lord Provost of Glasgow). The first burial took place on 9 June 1873, being that of seven-year-old Isabella Guthrie. From 1876 to 1877 various reburials took place moving earlier graves from Blackfriars Churchyard which was removed for railway improvements. From 1881 the cemetery also permitted Jewish burials in their own section known as the \"Bet Chaim\" (House of Life). This section was closed in 1908. Craigton Crematorium lies close to the northern boundary and was added in 1957 to a design by James Maitland Steel. It is currently run by the Co-op Funeralcare.Craigton Crematorium, Glasgow Retrieved 1 July 2018. The cemetery contains over 150,000 persons. ==Notable Interments== *Sir John Anthony (1862-1935) - Provost of Govan 1904 to 1908 *Andrew Brown (1825-1907) - ship designer and Provost of Renfrew *Joseph Buchanan (1864-1932) - Director and Chairman of Rangers Football Club *Dr Robert Cleghorn (1755-1821) - memorial by Greek Thomson reinterred here in 1875 *Robert Hunter Craig (1839-1913) MP for Govan and industrialist *John Simpson Crowther (1845-1914) - Arctic explorer with Benjamin Leigh Smith's expeditions of 1880 and 1881 *Memorial to the 124 victims of the SS Daphne which sank in 1883 - around 50 victims are buried here *Robert Wallace Forsyth (1843-1937) - founder of R.
