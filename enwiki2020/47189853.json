In one paper, it was shown to reduce hippocampal tryptophan hydroxylase activity by 54% after short-term treatment. In another study, it was shown to significantly reduce striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. ==See also== * 2,4,5-Trihydroxymethamphetamine ==References== Category:Neurotoxins Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Recreational drug metabolites ",
