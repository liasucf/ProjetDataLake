He is known for comedies such as Promedio Rojo (2004), the Qu\u00e9 pena trilogy (2010-2012), and the Paz Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n vehicles Sin filtro (2016) and No estoy loca (2018). ==Life and work== L\u00f3pez became interested in filmmaking at a young age. After reading Robert Rodriguez's Rebel Without a Crew (1995) and watching Kevin Smith's Clerks (1994), he began experimenting with his family's video camera. By the age of 12, he was already writing a column for El Mercurio, one of the most prestigious and conservative right-wing Chilean newspapers. His column, \"Memorias de un Ping\u00fcino\" (\"Memories of a Penguin\"), ran from 1997 to 1999 and described the life of a student, commonly known as a \"penguin\" in Chile because of the typical black and white uniform. The comments he made in the column led to him being expelled from school. At the age of 14, after his expulsion, he began a new column called \"L\u00f3pez\" with a more mature style.\"El Mercurio, y que le acarrea la expulsi\u00f3n de su colegio por sus fuertes cr\u00edticas al sistema educativo. Insiste con una nueva secci\u00f3n, \u201cL\u00f3pez\u201d, donde muestra una pluma m\u00e1s madura. \"Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez- Cinechile Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez datasheet, Cinechile, Enciclopedia del Cine Chileno / Santiago, Chile retrieved on January 18, 2015 At the age of 15, L\u00f3pez made his debut at the Valdivia Film FestivalPANIKO interview Crist\u00f3bal Bley, Paniko.cl retrieved on February 26, 2015 with the short film Pajero (\u201cwanker\u201d), which tells the story of a teenager constantly interrupted during masturbation.

He became partner and co- founder of sobras.com, a website about cinema, television, books, comics and video games that focused on young audiences. He then founded the first independent film festival in Santiago, the \"Sobras Independent Film Festival\", as well as Sobras.com Producciones, a film production company. As associate producer, L\u00f3pez took charge of the marketing of Jorge Olgu\u00edn's horror movie \u00c1ngel Negro in 2000, and the adult animation Cesante (\u201cunemployed\u201d), which he co-wrote. He also ran the marketing for other Chilean films such as Olgu\u00edn's Sangre Eterna (2002) and Orlando L\u00fcbbert's Taxi para tres (2001). He co- directed many music videos, and won an MTV Latin Music Award in 2002 for \"Mujer Robusta\" by Sinergia. He co-wrote the 2003 edition of the MTV Latin Music Award and, also in 2003, he directed, co-wrote and acted in an absurd comedy series for the same network, called Piloto MTV, along with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n. At the age of 20, L\u00f3pez directed his first feature film, Promedio Rojo (2004), an absurdist romantic comedy about teenage nerds, in which the main character slips in and out of reality, with the \u2018unreal\u2019 scenes animated. He won the special jury prize at the Vi\u00f1a del Mar International Film Festival, and featured in the Mar del Plata International Film Festival and LA Film Fest. Although the film was criticized in his native country, it caught the attention of international directors and other industry personalities including Salma Hayek, Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Guillermo del Toro.Young director has Hayek in his corner July 02, 2007 Lorenza Munoz Times Staff Writer, Los Angeles Times Articles - Copyright 2015 Los Angeles Times retrieved on January 19, 2015 In 2005, and with a bigger budget, L\u00f3pez began working on Santos,Santos (2008) IMDB IMDB 1990 - 2015, retrieved on January 19, 2015 a film about a failed comic artist. Released in 2008, the film was poorly received by critics and did not fulfill its financial expectations.

In 2012, L\u00f3pez partnered with the American director Eli Roth to release Aftershock, a Chilean-American disaster movie loosely inspired by events that took place during the 2010 Chile earthquake. It was L\u00f3pez's first English-language film and was produced for his company Sobras, by Roth, Miguel Asensio and Brian Oliver. The movie debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival.Movie Review: Fate Is Cruel and So Is Aftershock 2010 - 2015, New York Media LLC. All Rights Reserved. Vulture - Bilge Ebiri, retrieved on January 15, 2015 Following the box-office underperformance of Aftershock, The Green Inferno (2013) and Knock, Knock (2015), L\u00f3pez put his \"Chilewood\" ambitions with Roth on hold and returned to bawdy comedy, scoring huge hits with Sin filtro (2016), Hazlo como hombre (2017) and No estoy loca (2018). On 30 June 2018, eight Chilean actresses and models accused L\u00f3pez of sexual harassment and workplace bullying. The following day Netflix announced it was putting its deal with Sobras \"under review\" and L\u00f3pez himself posted a video online stating he was resigning from Sobras and that he would defend himself against the allegations: \"I don\u2019t understand what is happening nor the break in my years-long relationships of trust and affection. If I sometimes have been misunderstood, I apologize. But I\u2019m not a stalker nor an abuser.\" L\u00f3pez, Roth and Levy ==Awards== ;Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival *Nominated, Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver, Official Fant\u00e0stic Panorama Selection, Mis peores amigos: Promedio Rojo, El regreso (2013) *Nominated, Maria, Best Motion Picture, Aftershock (2012) ;Tokyo International Film Festival *Nominated, Tokyo Grand Prix, Promedio Rojo (2004) ;Vi\u00f1a del Mar International Film Festival *Won, Special Jury Award, Promedio Rojo (2004) ==Filmography== === Director === *Pajero (1998), short film *Superh\u00e9roes (1999), short film *Florofilia (2000), short film *Promedio Rojo (2004), feature film *Super Ni\u00f1o Bully (2007), short film *Santos (2008), feature film *Fuck My Life (2010), feature film *Qu\u00e9 pena tu boda (2011), feature film *Qu\u00e9 pena tu familia (2012), feature film *Aftershock (2012), feature film *Mis peores amigos: Promedio Rojo, El regreso (2013), feature film *Sin filtro (2016), feature film *Hazlo como hombre (2017), feature film *No estoy loca (2018), feature film === Screenwriter === *Pajero (1999) *Superh\u00e9roes (1999), with Esteban Rojas *Florofiia (1999), with Esteban Rojas, Alfredo Sepulveda and Francisco Ortega *MTV Video Music Awards Latinoam\u00e9rica 2003 (2003) *Promedio Rojo (2004) *Piloto MTV (2004), with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n *Super Ni\u00f1o Bully (2007), with Fabrizio Copano *Fuck My Life (2010), with Guillermo Amoedo *Qu\u00e9 pena tu boda (2011), with Amoedo *Qu\u00e9 pena tu familia (2012), with Amoedo *Fuerzas Especiales (2014) *Knock, Knock (2015), with Roth and Amoedo *Hazlo como hombre (2017), with Amoedo *No estoy loca (2018), with Amoedo === Producer === *Pajero (1999), producer *Superh\u00e9roes (1999), producer *Florofilia (2000) *\u00c1ngel Negro (2000), associate producer *Promedio Rojo (2004), executive producer *Normal con alas (2007), producer *Santos (2008), co-producer *The Green Inferno (2013), producer *Knock, Knock (2014), producer *The Stranger (2014), executive producer / producer *Fuerzas Especiales (2014), executive producer *Fuerzas Especiales 2: Cabos sueltos (2015), executive producer *Sin filtro (2016), executive producer === Actor === *Piloto MTV (2004), five first episodes *Promedio Rojo (2004), cameo appearance *Se arrienda (2005), cameo appearance *Santos (2008), montage cameo *El brindis (2008), cameo appearance *Solos (2008), doctor == Music videos == *Mujer robusta - Sinergia, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n (2002) *Concurso - Sinergia, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n (2002) *Chilerobot - Sinergia, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n (2003) *Te quiero ver muerta - Tiro Al Aire, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n *Traigo el aguante - Santo Barrio, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n (2002) *Toma lo que quieras - Claudio Qui\u00f1ones, with Eduardo Bertr\u00e1n ==See also== *Cinema of Chile ==References== ==External links== *Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez\u2019 production company *Nicol\u00e1s L\u00f3pez datasheet at Cinechile Category:Chilean film directors Category:Chilean film producers Category:Living people Category:Chilean screenwriters Category:Chilean male film actors Category:Chilean male comedians Category:1983 births Category:People from Santiago Category:Chilean male television actors ",
