It is the seat of Fony\u00f3d District. == History == The first mention of Fony\u00f3d was in a letter of Saint Ladislaus from 1082, as the village Funoldi. In 1232, the village was included into the lands of the Tihany Abbey. Maps from the 14th century show Fony\u00f3d as an island (with Balaton being larger), with a castle. The castle was occupied and destroyed in 1575 during the Turkish invasion, with no one living in the village by 1580. After the Turkish occupation, Fony\u00f3d remained uninhabited until the 19th century. The construction of a railway around Lake Balaton greatly contributed to the village's development. By 1900, Fony\u00f3d had become a holiday resort, and by 1910 over a thousand visitors were arriving each year. Fony\u00f3d attained town status in 1989. ==Economy== The town is famous for its mineral water which is bottled there under the name Fony\u00f3di and is owned by the Croatian company, Jana (part of Agrokor).Magyar Nemzet - July 13, 2004Fony\u00f3di The electronics producer cms manufacturing (owned by the Austrian cms electronics) and the Italian electronics device producer Datalogic operate factories in the town.Datalogic ==Notable residents== * Csilla Moln\u00e1r (1969 \u2013 1986), Hungarian beauty queen * Ilona Gy\u0151ri (1929 - 2001), Hungarian actress * Andr\u00e1s Fodor (1929 - 1997), Hungarian poet, essayist ==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities== Fony\u00f3d is twinned with: * Leipheim, Germany * Borsec, Romania * Novi Vinodolski, Croatia * Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, Slovakia * Krotoszyn, Poland ==Gallery== File:Fony\u00f3d l\u00e9gifot\u00f31.jpg File:Fony\u00f3d l\u00e9gifot\u00f32.jpg File:Fony\u00f3d l\u00e9gifot\u00f33.jpg File:Balatonbogl\u00e1r Datalogic.jpg ==See also== *Fony\u00f3d\u2013Als\u00f3b\u00e9latelep ==References== ==External links== * in Hungarian, English and German * Street map Category:Populated places in Somogy County Category:History of Somogy ",
