The first outlet was opened in Kaunas in December 2000. 65 outlets were planned in the Baltic, later to be supplemented by 107 outlets in Norway and Denmark. Unlike the Statoil stations, there are no franchisees, and all stations are vertically integrated. ==References== Category:Filling stations Category:Norwegian brands Category:Retail companies established in 2000 Category:Statoil Fuel & Retail Category:2000 establishments in Lithuania Category:Retail companies of Norway ",
