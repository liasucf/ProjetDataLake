    "text": "Gaia is a music group started initially as an alias of Armin van Buuren, which is known for the songs like \"Tuvan\", \"Stellar\" and \"Empire of Hearts\". The current members of Gaia are Armin van Buuren and Benno de Goeij, hence when a Gaia set is performed live, Armin and Benno both take the stage together. Armin has a running joke where he refers to Gaia as 'his friends' in order to not associate himself with the project. The first studio album of Gaia was released on June 21, 2019. == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35em;\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Moons Of Jupiter | * Release: June 21, 2019 * Label: Armada Music, Armind * Format: CD, streaming services, digital download, limited edition vinyl |} === Releases === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Track !Release Date !Writers !Length !Notes |- |4 Elements |1 April 2000 |Armin van Buuren |10:00 | * Used as the anthem for 4 Elements at Ahoy * Later released as \"Armin van Buuren - 4 Elements\" on 10 Years (Armin van Buuren album) |- |Tuvan |21 September 2009 |Armin van Buuren, Benno de Goeij |8:09 | * Also released with an intro mix * Also released as part of A State of Trance 2009 |- |Aisha |18 October 2010 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |8:20 | * Used as the anthem for SAIL Amsterdam * Also released as part of A State of Trance 2010 |- |Status Excessu D |16 March 2011 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |9:42 | * Used as the anthem for A State of Trance 500 * Also released as part of A State of Trance 2011 |- |Stellar |17 October 2011 |Armin van Buuren |7:34 |Also released as part of Universal Religion Chapter 5 |- |J'ai Envie De Toi |5 March 2012 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |8:37 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2012 |- |Humming The Lights |3 March 2013 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |6:57 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2013 |- |Empire of Hearts |10 March 2014 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij, Mark Sixma |6:09 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2014 |- |Carnation |13 March 2015 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij, Mark Sixma |5:13 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2015 |- |In Principio |20 April 2015 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |5:25 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2015 |- |Inyathi |15 April 2016 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |7:22 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2016 |- |Saint Vitus |3 August 2017 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |6:11 |Also released as part of A State of Trance 2017 |- |Crossfire |25 November 2017 |Armin van Buuren, Benno De Goeij |6:22 |Also released as part of A State of Trance Ibiza 2017 |- |} ==References== Category:Dutch dance music groups ",
