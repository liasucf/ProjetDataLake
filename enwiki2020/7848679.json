    "text": "Aetosauroides (meaning \"Aetosaurus-like\") is an extinct genus of aetosaur from the Late Triassic of South America. It is one of four aetosaurs known from South America, the others being Neoaetosauroides, Chilenosuchus and Aetobarbakinoides. Three species have been named: the type species A. scagliai, A. subsulcatus and A. inhamandensis. Fossils have been found in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Ischigualasto- Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin in northwestern Argentina and the Santa Maria Formation in the Paran\u00e1 Basin in southeastern Brazil. The strata date to the late Carnian and early Norian stages, making Aetosauroides one of the oldest aetosaurs. == Description == Restoration of A. scagliai Aetosauroides was proposed to be synonymous with the genus Stagonolepis in 1996 and 2002. Smaller specimens of both species were placed with Stagonolepis robertsoni, and larger specimens were considered to be S. wellesi. This synonymy is not accepted, with several studies identifying unique features that distinguish Aetosauroides from Stagonolepis. Among these are maxillae that do not touch the nostrils, oval- shaped holes on the centra of the vertebrae, and a convex margin of the lower jaw. In a 2011 study, A. subsulcatus and A. inhamandensis were proposed to be synonymous with A. scagliai. A phylogenetic analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat in 2012 found that Aetosauroides lies outside Stagonolepididae. If this phylogeny is correct, Stagonolepididae and Aetosauria would not be equivalent groupings, and Aetosauroides would be the first non-stagonolepidid aetosaur. == References == Category:Aetosaurs Category:Carnian life Category:Norian life Category:Late Triassic reptiles of South America Category:Triassic Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Ischigualasto Formation Category:Triassic Brazil Category:Fossils of Brazil Category:Santa Maria Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 1960 ",
