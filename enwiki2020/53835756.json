Zack had a book released about him in 2010, called \"Z-Man Darren Zack\" which chronicles his career. == Early life == Zack was born during 1960 in Garden River, Ontario, Canada to John and Edith Zack and grew up on the Garden River First Nations Reserve near Sault Ste. Marie. He is a part of the Ojibwa tribe and remains a resident of the Garden River First Nation reserve. His motivation to play fastball comes from his childhood and he shows this through the clinics he puts on for native children throughout Ontario. He has one sister Leslie and one brother Brenden. While he was young he was taught many sports, including fishing, hunting, football, and softball, the latter of which was a family tradition. Zack believes his family's love for Fastpitch and the fact they would throw the ball around with him as a child was instrumental to his career success. He has also commented that as a child the mentors in his life had encouraged him to go as far as he could with the sport. Specifically as a teenager, after consulting his grandfather with a dream about an eagle and playing for team Canada, his grandfather explained the eagle was the \"highest bird\" and symbolic of no one being able to break his records if he pursued fastpitch.

Zack's care for the youth is an asset for his political intentions. == Athletic career == Zack got his start in the game as a 14-year-old with the Garden River Braves in 1974. He began his fastball career at first and third base, but all the while he yearned to pitch. Zack kept practicing on the sidelines, biding his time, waiting his turn. When he was 19 years old his uncle did not show up for the game and he got his first chance to pitch.

In addition, he was named to the ISC All-World Team nine times between the years of 1992 and 2004. A highlight of his career was pitching 150 strikeouts over the course of 69.66 consecutive scoreless innings and winning 10 games at the 1995 ISC World Tournament in Iowa.
