    "text": "Revue d'histoire du fascisme (English: \"Journal of the History of Fascism\") was a neo-nazi magazine established by Fran\u00e7ois Duprat and published between 1972 and 1977. The quarterly magazine was launched in May 1972 by Duprat. Soon after, it sought to rehabilitate the pre-WWII fascist movements via the study of fascism by lenient authors. Maurice Bard\u00e8che published articles in the magazine. In a 1976 issue, Duprat reproached the Vichy regime for the nomination of Xavier Vallat, who was deemed \"too moderate\", as the head of the Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs. Duprat saw history as a political weapon, stating in May 1976: > We must not let to our opponents, Marxists and r\u00e9gimistes, the monopoly of > the historical representation of men, facts and ideas. Because History is a > wonderful war instrument, and it would be useless to deny that one of the > important reasons of our political hardships resides in the historical > exploitation and the systematic deformation of the nationalist experiences > of the past... It is in order to answer these needs... that a team of > intellectuals, professors and nationalists have created the Revue d'histoire > du fascisme.\"Fran\u00e7ois Duprat. \u00ab Front historique \u00bb, Ann\u00e9e Z\u00e9ro, May 1976. ==Notes== ===Footnotes=== ===References=== Category:Neo-Nazism Category:Magazines established in 1972 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1977 Category:French-language magazines Category:Magazines published in Paris Category:Fascist newspapers and magazines Category:Defunct political magazines published in France ",
