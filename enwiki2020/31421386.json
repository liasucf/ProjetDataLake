    "text": "The Lincoln Library of Essential Information was originally published as a one-volume general-reference work, in 1924. In later years, it was published in two- and three-volume editions, and the title was changed. The first edition of the Lincoln Library of Essential Information was published in 1924 by the Frontier Press of Buffalo, New York. It had 2,054 pages and was compiled by Michael J. Kinsella. While primarily a one volume publication during this time, two volume versions of the book were available from 1928, with the full index reproduced in both volumes. The encyclopedia was topically arranged and revised at two year intervals. By the 27th edition, published in 1967, it had 3 million words and a 20,000 entry index.Walsh, S. Padraig, 1922- Anglo-American general encyclopedias: a historical bibliography, 1703-1967 New York : Bowker, p.95 The set was named after Abraham Lincoln; as the title page said \"Named in honor of Abraham Lincoln whose inspiring example illustrated the possibilities of self-education\".The Lincoln library of essential information 25th ed.

In 1978 the encyclopedia expanded to three volumes and was rebranded the New Lincoln Library Encyclopedia, however this was discontinued in 1981 and the set went back to its old name and a two volume only format.Kenneth F.

After the last copies were sold in 1988 Frontier Press let the book go out of print.
