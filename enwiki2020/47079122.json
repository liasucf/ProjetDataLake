He writes for El Pais.http://elpais.com/autor/cesar_rendueles_menendez_de_llano/a/ His book, Sociophobia: Political change in the era of digital utopia (2013) had a great impact and was selected as one of ten books of the year by the newspaper El Pais.http://networkcultures.org/geert/2014/10/25/conversation-with-spanish- social-critic-cesar-rendueles/ In it the author questions, among other things, the importance of social networks and the Internet in political action; in fact, its effect is solvent and generates a decreased social reality, not increased, lowering expectations for what can be expected from political intervention or personal relationships. He questions, first, the ideological consensus regarding the ability of communication technologies to induce positive social dynamics. Secondly, he makes an analysis of capitalist society as a system that is destructive of community relations and puts isolated citizens at the center of political redemption.https://web.archive.org/web/20140126124248/http://www.capitanswinglibros.com/autores.php/cesar- rendueles Concepts like cyberfetishism or digital mirage are derived from this way of thinking. ==Bibliography== * Sociophobia: Political Change in the Digital Utopia, translated by Heather Cleary, foreword by Roberto Simanowski, Columbia University Press, NYC 2017, . * Capitalismo canalla.
