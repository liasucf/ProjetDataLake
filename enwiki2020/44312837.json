She was born in Beirut in 1943 and grew up in Lebanon and came to the United States in the early 1960s. She was educated at the Beirut College for Women, Anderson College, Ball State University and Indiana University Bloomington, receiving a PhD in comparative literature from the latter institution. Accad taught at Beirut University College in 1978 and 1984 and at Northwestern University in 1991. She is Professor Emerita in Francophone, Arabophone, African, Middle East, Women's Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and the Lebanese American University in Beirut. She published her first novel L'Excis\u00e9e in 1982; it was translated into English as The Excised in 1989. This novel deals with excision of women in both the physical and metaphorical sense. Although she has her own unique style, Accad was strongly influenced by the Egyptian- born French writer Andr\u00e9e Chedid and the Egyptian writer Nawal El Saadawi. == Selected works == === Fiction === * Coquelicot du massacre (1988) * Blessures des Mots: Journal de Tunisie (1993); English version Wounding Words: A Woman's Journal in Tunisia (1996) === Non-fiction === * Veil of shame: the role of women in the contemporary fiction of North Africa and the Arab world (1978); received the International Educator's Award * Sexuality and War: Literary Masks of the Middle East (1990) * Des femmes, des hommes et la guerre: Fiction et Realite au Proche-Orient (1993); received the France-Lebanon Literary Award * Voyages en cancer (2000); received the Prix Phenix de Literature; English version The Wounded Breast: Intimate Journeys Through Cancer (2001) == References == Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Lebanese emigrants to the United States Category:American women novelists Category:20th-century American novelists Category:Ball State University alumni Category:Indiana University Bloomington alumni Category:Lebanese American University faculty Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign faculty Category:20th- century American women writers Category:Novelists from Illinois Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers ",
