The parody ends with Al shouting \"I feel bad!\" instead of Brown's trademark \"I feel good!\" The music video was shot on the same set Brown performed on in Rocky IV. Paul Shanklin also parodied \"Living in America\" on his 1999 album Bill Clinton: The Comeback Kid Tour in a song entitled \"Sneaking in America\", as a reference to illegal immigration to America. The song was also parodied in TV advertisements for the TV series Daisy Does America, substituting the show's title for the song's. ==References== ==External links== *Review at AllMusic Category:1985 singles Category:1986 singles Category:American patriotic songs Category:Dan Hartman songs Category:James Brown songs Category:Songs from Rocky Category:Songs written by Charlie Midnight Category:Songs written by Dan Hartman Category:Songs about the United States Category:Scotti Brothers Records singles ",
