After a number of short-term jobs, including a period in the Indian Army, Anderson joined The Guardian where he remained for the rest of his career. He began to write books seriously in the 1960s, with a special interest in stories of real life adventure on the sea. He reported on Francis Chichester's voyages and edited Chichester's Atlantic Adventure in 1962. In 1966, he was the leader of a Guardian-sponsored crew that sailed a cutter from England to North America in order to replicate Leif Erikson's voyage, and in 1967 he published an account of the journey. He also produced topographical, children's, and other works but is best known for his Peter Blair and Piet Deventer mysteries, the last of which, Late Delivery, was published posthumously in 1982. ==Early life== John Anderson was born in Georgetown, British Guiana (modern Guyana),Kay, Ernest.

He then tried to establish a soap manufactury in Trinidad, but after that failed he returned to Britain to work at Manchester's journal of the textile industry, the Textile Recorder. He served in the Indian Army and taught gunners trigonometry by writing a manual in Urdu, that he learned in three months, in which he compared the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle to that between cousins of various degrees within a family. He was invalided out of the Indian Army in 1944, from whom he refused to accept a disability pension due to the country's poverty, and was then taken on by The Guardian where he became the paper's correspondent at Eisenhower's headquarters in the later period of the Second World War. After the end of the war he became The Guardian labour correspondent and then an assistant editor in their Manchester office and a leader writer. A keen sailor himself, he reported on Francis Chichester's voyages and edited Chichester's Atlantic Adventure in 1962.
