    "text": "Iodobenzene dichloride (PhICl2) is a complex of iodobenzene with chlorine. As a reagent for organic chemistry, it is used as an oxidant and chlorinating agent. ==Chemical structure== Single-crystal X-ray crystallography has been used to determine its structure; as can be predicted by VSEPR theory, it adopts a T-shaped geometry about the central iodine atom. ==Preparation== Iodobenzene dichloride is not stable, and is not commonly available commercially. It is prepared by passing chlorine gas through a solution of iodobenzene in chloroform, from which it precipitates. The same reaction has been reported at pilot plant scale (20 kg) as well. :Ph-I + Cl2 \u2192 PhICl2 An alternate preparation involving the use of chlorine generated in situ by the action of sodium hypochlorite on hydrochloric acid has also been described. ==Reactions== Iodobenzene dichloride is hydrolyzed by basic solutions to give iodosobenzene (PhIO), and is oxidized by sodium hypochlorite to give iodoxybenzene (PhIO2). In organic synthesis, iodobenzene dichloride is used as a reagent for the selective chlorination of alkenes and alkynes. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Iodanes Category:Oxidizing agents Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Phenyl compounds ",
