    "text": "SlimFast is an American company headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida that markets an eponymous brand of shakes, bars, snacks, packaged meals, and other dietary supplement foods sold in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latin America, and the U.K. SlimFast promotes diets and weight loss plans featuring its food products. == Effectiveness == There is a lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of the diet, although it appears to function no better than behavioral counseling. Review in: Ann Intern Med. 2015 Aug 18;163(4):JC8 ==History== SlimFast was started in 1977 as a product line of the Thompson Medical Company, founded in the 1940s by S. Daniel Abraham. Thompson Medical also sold the controversial weight loss dietary supplement Dexatrim. In 1987, Abraham took the brand private, and it was acquired by Unilever in 2000. In 2014, Unilever sold SlimFast to Kainos Capital. After the sale, KSF Acquisition invested with Kainos Capital in order to take responsibility for the SlimFast brand in the UK, Ireland and Germany. In 2018, Glanbia Plc. acquired SlimFast from Kainos Capital. ==Products== ===Original (1987\u20132004)=== SlimFast was originally just a diet shake product line. It consisted of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla shakes meant to replace breakfast and lunch. The company suggested customers eat a low-calorie dinner. Usually, dieters would pick a low-calorie frozen dinner brand such as Lean Cuisine or Weight Watchers, as the SlimFast diet was a convenience product line that offered none of its own dinner products. Later, in the mid-1990s, SlimFast began offering meal bars that could be used as meal replacements. ==2009 recall== On December 3, 2009, SlimFast recalled all of its canned products due to possible bacterial contamination. The company stated that it had halted production until the cause was discovered. No further problems or issues have been noted. In 2011, SlimFast stopped producing cans and has since used plastic bottles. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Brand name diet products Category:Unilever brands Category:Products introduced in 1977 Category:Dietary supplements Category:Low-carbohydrate diets Category:2000 mergers and acquisitions Category:2014 mergers and acquisitions ",
