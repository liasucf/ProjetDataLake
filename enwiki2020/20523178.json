    "text": "The 2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team represented the University of Alabama in the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 115th overall season, 76th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and its 18th within the SEC Western Division. The team was led by head coach Nick Saban, in his third year, and played their home games at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. They finished the season undefeated with a record of 14\u20130 (8\u20130 in the SEC) and as national champions. Looking to build on the successes of the 2008 campaign, Alabama entered the 2009 season as the favorite to win the Western Division and meet the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game. Alabama closed the regular season with a 12\u20130 record including four wins against Top 25-ranked teams\u2014and met the Gators for the SEC Championship in a rematch of the 2008 contest. Alabama was victorious by a final score of 32\u201313. The following day, final Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were unveiled. No. 1 ranked Alabama would meet No. 2 ranked Texas for the BCS National Championship. In the BCS National Championship Game, the Crimson Tide defeated the Longhorns 37\u201321 to capture their first-ever BCS Championship. With the 14-0 record, they became only the 2nd team in college football history to accomplish this feat, behind the 2002 Buckeyes. Alabama earned their third SEC championship since the inception of the SEC Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd SEC title. The victory over Texas gave Alabama their 13th national championship in football (their eighth wire service title since the AP Poll began in 1936) and their ninth perfect season since 1925. The season included victories over the previous three national champions: Florida, Louisiana State University (LSU), and Texas. The season marked the first time a player for Alabama won the Heisman Trophy: Mark Ingram won the award over Stanford running back Toby Gerhart. Other award winners included Rolando McClain, who won the Butkus Award and the Jack Lambert Award, and defensive coordinator Kirby Smart, who won the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach. Also, six players were named to various All-America Teams with Terrence Cody, Mike Johnson, and Javier Arenas being consensus selections and Ingram and McClain each being unanimous selections. ==Before the season== During the 2008\u20132009 campaign, the Crimson Tide completed a perfect 12\u20130 regular season record with wins over No. 9 Clemson, No. 3 Georgia, longtime rival Tennessee, No. 16 LSU, and in-state rival Auburn to end a six-game losing streak in the Iron Bowl. The Tide went on to lose their final two games in the postseason to end the season 12\u20132. They lost to the Florida Gators (31\u201320) in the SEC Championship Game, and to the Utah Utes (31\u201317) in the Sugar Bowl. Alabama reached No. 1 in the AP and Coaches' Polls for the first time since the final polls in 1992 and during the regular season for the first time since 1980 between weeks ten and fourteen. The Tide reached No. 1 in the BCS rankings for the first time in school history between weeks ten and fourteen. The team finished the 2008 season with a final ranking of No. 6 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. In February 2009, Alabama signed the No. 1 recruiting class according to Rivals and the No. 2 recruiting class according to Scout. Spring practice began on March 13 and concluded with the annual A-Day game on April 18. Televised live by ESPN, the Crimson team defeated the White team by a score of 14\u20137 before 84,050 fans in Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium. Greg McElroy and Marquis Maze were named co-MVPs of the game. On June 11, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions sanctioned Alabama for \"major violations\" of NCAA policies as a result of athletes who received improper benefits in 16 of 19 NCAA sports, including football. As a penalty, the football program was forced to vacate 21 victories from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons in addition to being placed on three years probation, ending in June 2012. The university stated that none of the textbooks or materials identified in the investigation were used for profit, and that the athletes involved who still had eligibility remaining were to pay restitution for the additional materials identified as part of the inquiry. Alabama appealed the ruling to the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in late June, but was unsuccessful; the Committee upheld the sanctions in March 2010.

The Tide dominated play for most of the game, outgaining Tech in total offense by 498 yards to 155, but mistakes, penalties, and poor play by the special teams allowed the Hokies to hang on until 18 fourth-quarter points sealed the 34\u201324 Alabama victory. Bama scored first with field goals of 49 and 34 yards from Leigh Tiffin to take an early 6\u20130 lead. The Hokies responded with a 98-yard Dyrell Roberts kickoff return for a touchdown to give Tech a 7\u20136 lead.

For his performance, left guard Mike Johnson was named the SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73\u201318\u20133 (72\u201319\u20133 without NCAA vacations and forfeits). ===Chattanooga=== Sources: Javier Arenas returned a kickoff for touchdown in the second quarter. On senior day in Tuscaloosa, Alabama dipped down to college football's Football Championship Subdivision and defeated the Mocs of UT-Chattanooga 45\u20130. After being stopped on their first possession, Alabama reached the end zone on the next five consecutive possessions in running up a 35\u20130 lead in the first half. First-quarter touchdowns included a 2-yard Trent Richardson run, a 25-yard Mark Ingram run, and a 19-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy. In the second quarter, touchdowns were scored by Javier Arenas on a 66-yard punt return and on a 40-yard Ingram run. With the only third quarter points coming on a 41-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal, Bama's final points of the afternoon came on a 21-yard Roy Upchurch touchdown run in the fourth. Javier Arenas set the all-time SEC record with his seventh punt return for a touchdown and was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week. Mark Ingram led the offense with 102 yards and two touchdowns before being pulled early in the second quarter. Alabama outgained Chattanooga in total offense 422\u201384 and recorded their first defensive shutout since defeating Auburn 36\u20130 in 2008. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 11\u20130. ===Auburn=== Sources: One year after Alabama's 36\u20130 victory in Tuscaloosa, the 2009 Iron Bowl contest against the Auburn Tigers ended with a 26\u201321 Tide victory and a 12\u20130 regular season. The Tigers, who entered the game 7\u20134 and unranked, took the ball after Alabama's initial three and out and struck quickly. On Auburn's fourth play from scrimmage, Terrell Zachery raced 67 yards on a reverse for a touchdown and a 7\u20130 Auburn lead. The run was the longest allowed by the Tide since a 70-yard run by Arkansas' Darren McFadden in 2005. Auburn then successfully executed an onside kick and retained possession of the ball. After the onside kick, Auburn drove 58 yards in 12 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Chris Todd to Eric Smith. The Crimson Tide, which had never trailed in a game by more than seven points all season, found itself down 14\u20130 before the first quarter was over. Early in the second quarter Alabama completed a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two- yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14\u201314 at halftime. In the third quarter, Auburn scored on another quick strike. The Tigers took possession on their 24 after a Bama punt; Kodi Burns rushed for four yards, and then Todd hit Darvin Adams on a 72-yard completion that put Auburn back in front 21\u201314. The completion marked the longest play from scrimmage allowed by the Bama defense all season and the longest pass play since 1999. Javier Arenas gave Alabama an opportunity by returning the ensuing kickoff 46 yards to the Auburn 45, but Mark Ingram, who struggled the entire game, rushed for 7 yards and 2 yards and then was held for no gain on both third and one and fourth and one, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs. Auburn went three and out and punted, and Arenas set the Tide up again, returning the punt 56 yards to the Auburn 33-yard line. Alabama drove to the Auburn 10 before settling for a Leigh Tiffin field goal that cut the deficit to 21\u201317. Alabama kicked off and two plays later, Auburn quarterback Todd threw an interception that gave Alabama possession at the Auburn 43. The Tide drove to the Tigers' 13 before this drive also stalled, forcing another Leigh Tiffin field goal that made the score 21\u201320. As the third quarter ended, Auburn continued to hang on to a one-point lead. Neither team could make progress with possessions early in the fourth quarter, and after an exchange of punts, Alabama got the ball on its own 21 with 8:27 to go, and began what would soon be known as \"The Drive\". Richardson opened with a 7-yard rush, and on third and three, McElroy completed a nine-yard pass to Julio Jones for a first down. Three plays later, on third and five, McElroy completed a six-yard pass to Jones for another first down and advancing the ball to the Tide 48. Two plays later, on second and eight, a third pass from McElroy to Jones for 11 yards led to a third first down. Two plays after that, a fourth pass from McElroy to Jones and a fourth first down at the Auburn 28-yard line. On second and nine at the Auburn 27, McElroy chose a different target, hitting Richardson for a first down to the Auburn 11-yard line. After a four-yard run by Richardson to the Auburn 7, the Tigers called time out with 1:34 left. Richardson took the ball three more yards to the Auburn 4, leaving the Tide at third and three. Each team called a time out in succession with 1:29 left. Alabama's offensive coaches called for a running play, but head coach Nick Saban, unwilling to settle for a field goal, overruled this decision and demanded a pass. McElroy completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to third-string tailback Roy Upchurch, giving Alabama a 26\u201321 lead with 1:24 to go. McElroy had completed seven consecutive passes on The Drive after missing his first. A two-point conversion attempt failed and the lead was five points. Auburn took possession at the 25 following the kickoff and took 1:14 to run four plays and advance the ball to its own 46 with ten seconds to go. Todd completed a 17-yard pass to Darvin Adams at the Alabama 37, and after spiking the ball, Todd's last pass fell incomplete and the game was over. Alabama had survived, beating Auburn 26\u201321 despite being outgained 332 yards to 291 and being held to only 73 yards rushing. ===Florida=== Sources: Alabama faced Florida in the SEC Championship Game in a rematch of the 2008 contest, with the Tide capturing their 22nd conference championship following their 32\u201313 victory over the Gators. The Tide struck first, driving 47 yards with the opening possession before Leigh Tiffin kicked a 48-yard field goal and a 3\u20130 lead. Following a Florida three and out on their first possession, Alabama responded with an 8-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. On the drive, Greg McElroy completed key passes to Colin Peek and Marquis Maze and Mark Ingram rushed for 37 yards and the touchdown in taking a 9\u20130 lead following a missed extra point. On the ensuing possession, Caleb Sturgis hit a 48-yard field goal that made the score 9\u20133 at the end of the first quarter. Alabama scored first in the second quarter on a 34-yard Tiffin field goal to complete a 68-yard drive and extend the Bama lead to 12\u20133. Florida followed with what turned out to be its only touchdown drive of the game. Rushes of 23 yards and 15 yards from quarterback and former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow were followed by a 23-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to David Nelson, and Florida had cut the lead to two, 12\u201310. On the next offensive play, Ingram took a short pass from McElroy and raced 69 yards to the Gator 3-yard line, and ran it in for a touchdown from three yards out on the next play. The Gators ended the first half with a 32-yard Sturgis field goal to make the halftime score 19\u201313. Florida opened the third quarter with a three and out. On the Tide's first offensive series of the second half, McElroy completed a 28-yard pass to Maze and was followed with a 15-yard personal foul penalty in bringing the ball into the red zone. On the next play McElroy completed the drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Colin Peek. Alabama took a 26\u201313 lead. Florida got one first down on its next possession before punting the ball to Alabama. Taking the ball at its own 12-yard line with 7:36 to go in the third quarter, Alabama held the ball for the rest of the quarter and into the fourth, using up 8:47 of game time on a 12-play, 88-yard drive. Ingram, who rushed for 37 yards on the drive, scored on a 1-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to increase Bama's lead to 32\u201313. Florida mounted a late drive that reached the Alabama 6 before Tebow threw an interception to Javier Arenas in the end zone. On Florida's next possession, the Gators turned the ball over on downs at the Alabama 13, and the Tide was able to run out the clock to secure the 32\u201313 victory. For his 239-yard, one touchdown passing performance, Greg McElroy was named the game's MVP. Ingram rushed for 113 and Trent Richardson rushed for 80 yards. The victory gave Alabama its 22nd SEC title, their third since the inception of the Championship Game and their first in ten years\u2014the longest time the Crimson Tide program has ever gone without an SEC championship. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 20\u201314 (21\u201314 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory). Alabama earned their third SEC championship since the inception of the SEC Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd SEC title. ===Texas=== Sources: 50-yard line action for the national championship Following victories in their respective conference championship games, on December 6 the final Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were unveiled, pitting the No. 1 ranked Crimson Tide against the No. 2 ranked Texas Longhorns for the 2010 BCS National Championship. The game was held in the Rose Bowl, although it was not the actual Rose Bowl Game, in which Ohio State beat Oregon six days earlier. Alabama came into the game having never beaten Texas, compiling an all-time 0\u20137\u20131 record against the Longhorns. Alabama won the toss and elected to receive the opening kickoff. After losing thirteen yards on a sack and a penalty, Nick Saban called for a fake punt, which resulted in a Texas interception by Blake Gideon at the Alabama 37-yard line. On the initial possession, Texas quarterback Colt McCoy suffered a hit from Marcell Dareus which forced him to leave the game. Suffering from a pinched nerve in his throwing shoulder, McCoy did not return. With McCoy out, freshman Garrett Gilbert replaced him at quarterback, and the Longhorns settled for a field goal and a 3\u20130 lead. The ensuing kickoff was an onside kick, and Texas retained possession of the ball when Alabama failed to field the kick. The Longhorns only advanced the ball five yards and Hunter Lawrence kicked another field goal to go ahead 6\u20130. Coaches' Trophy on display at the Paul W. Bryant Museum The Tide went ahead in the second quarter. Greg McElroy threw for only 58 yards on 6 of 11 passing for Alabama, but 23 of those yards came on a completion to Julio Jones that advanced the ball to the Texas 12. Three plays later Mark Ingram ran it in from two yards out, and Alabama went ahead 7\u20136. After an exchange of punts, Bama took possession on the Texas 49-yard line, and on the second play Trent Richardson burst through a hole in the middle and raced 49 yards untouched for the touchdown, extending the lead to 14\u20136. Texas continued to struggle for offense in McCoy's absence, and on the next possession a Texas drive ended when Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass at the Alabama 25. Following a short punt late in the quarter, Bama drove to the Texas 9, and increased their lead to 17\u20136 following a successful 26-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. It appeared that the Crimson Tide would go into the locker room leading 17\u20136. However, after gaining nine yards on a rush up the middle, Texas called time out with 15 seconds left. With the ball at the Texas 37, Gilbert threw a shovel pass to D.J. Monroe, who bobbled the ball and batted it into the arms of Alabama defensive lineman Marcell Dareus, who lumbered 28 yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 24\u20136. Having been sacked 4 times in the first half but had considerable success rushing the ball, Alabama came out rushing after halftime, attempting only two passes in the 3rd quarter. Meanwhile, Gilbert, who had struggled early in the game, started to find his rhythm, mostly due to the efforts of Jordan Shipley, one of only two Texas receivers to catch a pass thrown beyond the line of scrimmage in the game. A 44-yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Shipley cut the lead to 24\u201313. Early in the fourth, Leigh Tiffin missed a 52-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, the Longhorns drove 65 yards and scored another touchdown on a 28-yard Shipley reception. A successful two- point conversion pulled the score to within three points, 24\u201321. Following an Alabama punt, Texas gained possession on their own 7-yard line with 3:14 to go. On the second play of the drive, Eryk Anders laid a hit on Gilbert that forced a fumble, and Alabama recovered at the Texas 3. Three plays later Ingram, who rushed for 116 yards in the game, ran it in for the score that gave Alabama a 31\u201321 lead. On the following drive, Gilbert threw a second interception to Arenas, and a Trent Richardson touchdown with 47 seconds left made the final score 37\u201321. For their performances, Mark Ingram was named the game's offensive MVP and Marcell Dareus was named defensive MVP. Alabama beat Texas for the first time in their history, won its first ever BCS championship game, and won its first national championship since 1992. It was Alabama's thirteenth claimed and eighth national championship by vote of the AP poll or coaches' poll, the others coming in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979, and 1992, and ninth perfect season, the others coming in 1925, 1930, 1934, 1945, 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1992. Alabama became the third school in major college history to go 14\u20130, joining the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes and the 2009 Boise State Broncos. ==Rankings== Entering the 2009 season, the Crimson Tide was ranked No. 5 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls.
