Until the change in the club management in early 2000s, Adanaspor had a loyal fan base and had spectator average of 10000 to 15000 at every game. Since the club converted into a one-owner private company, although they continued to be supported at a good season, level of loyalty diminished sharply. During the seasons in which Adanaspor had poor results, average number of spectators fell down to 1500, way below the averages of the years from 1970 to 2000. Adanaspor's main supporters group is Turbeyler. Their permanent location at the 5 Ocak Stadium is the GKA (South Stands) which they call it the 'Arjantin K\u00f6\u015fe' (en:Argentine Corner). Before 2000s at the derby matches, the West and the large East stand were shared equally by Adana Demir and Adanaspor fans, Adana Demir fans settle at the north seats of these Stands and Adanaspor fans settle at the south section. Since 2000s, the entire West and East Stands were open only to the fans of the official host of the derby match. When Adana Demirspor is hosting, Adanaspor fans are only allowed to the 1600-seat South Stand and when Adanaspor is hosting, Adana Demirspor fans are only allowed to the 1600-seat North Stand. Adanaspor are not known to have any political tendencies, however they were once owned by communications industry mogul Cem Uzan, who had links to the nationalist Youth Party.\"Football in Asia: History, Culture and Business\", Routledge 2016, Younghan Cho, p.46 ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Adanaspor on TFF.org Category:Sport in Adana Adanaspor Category:Association football clubs established in 1954 Category:1954 establishments in Turkey ",
