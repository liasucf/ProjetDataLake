In 2012, she moved to Calgary to take up bobsledding. Prior to her first world cup event, Rissling had to raise in order to purchase a sled for competition, after the Canadian bobsleigh team decided to instead allocate the funds towards the men's team. She raised the money through sponsorships and a waitressing job in a Calgary diner. ==Career== On February 7, 2015, in Park City, Utah, as part of the North American cup tour, Rissling piloted the first four-woman team in an official four-man bobsled race with Julia Corrente, Courtenay Farrington, and Josee Theoret.
