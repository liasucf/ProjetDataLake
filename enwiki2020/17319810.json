    "text": "Haliaetum was a Roman port that stood in the area of Simon Bay, next to the nowaday's village of Jagodje, on the northern Adriatic coast of the Istrian peninsula. Remains visible at extreme low tide include parts of its pier as well as various port buildings. Some excavations have been carried out in recent years, with more excavations planned in the future. The site is also open to tourists. The port was first established around 178-177BC following fierce resistance by the Histri, the indigenous population.From the Izola- Isola municipal website: \"Rimski zasedbi Istre leta 178 pred n.\u0161t. so se Histri mo\u010dno upirali, vendar so bili premagani\". The Roman occupation of Istria of 178BC was strongly resisted by the Histri, but they were defeated.

It was erected in the 11th century and was later redesigned in the Baroque style. == References == Category:Roman towns and cities in Slovenia Category:Ancient ports and harbours Category:History of Istria Category:Municipality of Izola ",
