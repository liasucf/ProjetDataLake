McGowan moved from League of Ireland club Shelbourne to West Ham United in 1948, following a recommendation from Shels manager Charlie Turner, who had played for the Hammers before the war. He played as an inside forward, later converting to wing half. There, he joined an Irish contingent of players that included Tommy Moroney and Frank O'Farrell, who had been recruited from Cork United. McGowan played 88 times for The Hammers, scoring 9 goals, before moving to Southern League club Chelmsford City in 1954. After a season, he moved on to Folkestone Town of the Kent League. He made three international appearances for the Republic of Ireland national football team, all games in 1949. After his retirement from football, he worked at the London Electricity Board for 22 years. He died in 1994 after suffering from Parkinson's disease. His funeral took place in Canning Town and was attended by former teammate John Dick. == References == ==External links== * West Ham stats site * Ireland international team stats site Category:1924 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Association football wing halves Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Ireland (FAI) international footballers Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players Category:Folkestone F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:English Football League players Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease ",
