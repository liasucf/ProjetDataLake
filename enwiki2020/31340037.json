    "text": "Robert Crone (c. 1740 - 1779) was an Irish painter who studied with Richard Wilson in Rome. ==Life== Crone was born in Dublin about the middle of the 1700s, and received his early instruction from Robert Hunter, the portrait painter; but he soon left that branch of the profession, and commenced painting landscapes, in which he achieved considerable success. In 1755 he went to Rome, where he studied under Richard Wilson for about a year. James Martin noted in his journal that Crone \"has chiefly studyed Claude Lorrain and I believe is reckoned to have a good Deal of his Manner\". Crone remained in Rome until 1767. The next year he was in London, where he showed two drawings at the Society of Arts. From 1772 until 1778 he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy, although much hindered and tried by ill-health superinduced by frequent epileptic fits. His first exhibited pictures were two landscapes called Morning and Evening.Bryan 1886\u201389 He exhibited drawings, some of which were finished after Richard Wilson's style in black and white chalk on a bluish-grey paper. His landscapes are now very scarce and much sought after; a few examples are in the Royal Collection. He died in London in 1779. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1779 deaths Category:18th-century Irish painters Category:Irish male painters Category:Irish landscape painters Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
