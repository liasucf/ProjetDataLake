    "text": "Veronique and Gregory Peck The Gregory Peck Award for Cinematic Excellence is an award given annually at the San Diego International Film Festival (SDIFF) to honor the career achievement of a film actor, producer or director. It is named in memory of iconic actor Gregory Peck with the support of his family. The award is SDIFF's most prestigious award and headlining presentation at their fanciest formal event Variety's Night of the Stars. == History == The award originated in 2008 at the Dingle International Film Festival (DIFF) in Ireland with the support and participation of Pecks' family, who chose Dingle because it is the ancestral home of the actor's great-grandmother Catherine Ashe who hailed from Annascaul in the Dingle Peninsula. In 2014, the family began presenting the award in San Diego where the actor was born, raised his family and where he founded the La Jolla Playhouse. Since the DIFF was forced to close due to financial reasons in 2019, the award is presented exclusively at SDIFF. == Trophies == Winners in Dingle were awarded with a design based on \"The Aglish Pillar\" created by Irish Jeweller Brian de Staic. Winners in San Diego have received a \"Golden Eagle Statuette\" sculpted by Apache artist Ruben Chato. == Honorees == {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" https://web.archive.org/web/20180709014159/http://www.kiff.in/2017/results.php |+ !Date !Recipient !Presented by !Venue !Notes !Ref |- |Oct. 18, 2019 |Laurence Fishburne |Cecilia Peck |Pendry Hotel - Downtown San Diego | | |- |June 29, 2019 |Maurice Galway |Anthony Peck |The Phonix Cinema - Dingle |Presented to the founder of the Dingle IFF upon the occasion of its closing. | |- |October 11, 2018 |Keith Carradine |Cecilia Peck |Pendry Hotel - Downtown San Diego | | |- |October 5, 2017 |Patrick Stewart |Cecilia Peck |Pendry Hotel - Downtown San Diego | | |- |September 29, 2016 |Annette Bening |Anthony Peck |Museum of Contemporary Art - La Jolla | | |- |2016 |The Peck Family | |Santa Barbara, California |Presented by DIFF and the Santa Barbara Sister City Board to commemorate Gregory Peck's centenary year. | |- |September 25, 2014 |Alan Arkin | |Museum of Contemporary Art - La Jolla | | |- |June 16, 2014 |Laura Dern |Jim Sheridan |The Blasket Centre, D\u00fan Chaoin | | |- |March 18, 2011 |Jean-Jacques Beineix | |The Phoneix Cinema - Dingle | | |- |March 20, 2010 |Stephen Frears | |The Phonix Cinema - Dingle | | |- |September 11, 2009 |Jim Sheridan |Anthony Peck |The Phoenix Cinema - Dingle | | |- |2008 |Gabriel Byrne |Veronique and Cecilia Peck (In attendance) |Dingle | | |} == See also == * List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners ==References== == External links == *GregoryPeck.com *San Diego International Film Festival *Dingle International Film Festival Category:International film awards Category:Lists of films by award Category:Awards established in 2008 ",
