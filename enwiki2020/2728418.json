    "text": "Joan Murray (born August 6, 1945) is an American poet, writer, playwright and editor. She is best known for her narrative poems, particularly her book- length novel-in-verse, Queen of the Mist; her collection Looking for the Parade which won the National Poetry Series Open Competition, and her New and Selected Poems volume,Swimming for the Ark, which was chosen as the inaugural volume in White Pine Press's Distinguished Poets Series. ==Early life and education== Joan Murray was born in the South Bronx and attended Hunter College, first as a studio art major, and later as an English major, winning Hunter College's Bernard Cohen fiction prize. She married at 19 and had two children (one of whom died in infancy). She earned an M.A. from New York University and, in 1970, began teaching at Lehman College of the City University of New York. ==Career== Murray\u2019s first collection, The Same Water, won the Wesleyan New Poets Series Competition and was a finalist for the Academy of American Poets\u2019 Walt Whitman Award. Her second book, Queen of the Mist, a novel-in-verse about the first person to go over Niagara in a barrel, was chosen by Joyce Carol Oates as runner up for a Poetry Society of America award; she was also commissioned by Broadway\u2019s Jujamcyn Theaters to adapt it for the stage. Her third book, Looking for the Parade, was chosen by Robert Bly as winner of the National Poetry Series Open Competition. Her fourth book, Dancing on the Edge, was published in connection with her bestselling 9/11 anthology, Poems to Live By in Uncertain Times, and she is also the editor of its anti-war sequel, Poems to Live by in Troubling Times. She was poetry co- editor of The Pushcart Prize 25th Anniversary Edition, and is the editor of The Pushcart Book of Poetry: the Best Poems from Thirty Years of The Pushcart Prize. Her collection, Swimming for the Ark: New & Selected Poems, 1990-2015, was the inaugural volume in the White Pine Press Distinguished Poets Series. Murray's poetry, fiction, and essays have appeared in many journals including The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, The Hudson Review, the Paris Review,http://www.parisreview.com/results.php?prmKeyword=joan%20murray Poetry, The Nation,http://www.thenation.com/archive/search.mhtml?query1=Joan%20Murray The New York Times, The New Yorker; the Village Voice; and in anthologies, including The Best American Poetry and The Pushcart Prize. She has read her work on NPR's Morning Edition, Radiolab, The Bob Edwards Show and The Chautauqua Lectures. Typically Murray\u2019s poetry focuses on actual people whose situations evoke an empathetic, often social-activist response. Technically, her poems are characterized by a narrative structure, detailed imagery, long, rhythmic, free-verse lines, and emotional effects. The Poetry Foundation has said of it, \u201cWorking in free verse, Murray is a master of the single, unforgettable detail. Her accessible, image-driven narratives harness the urgency of their moral or social context while staying true to the pacing and music of daily life.\u201d In addition to her primary career as a writer and editor, Murray has held the position of Writer in Residence at the New York State Writers Institute at the State University of New York at Albany, and was Poet in Residence at Olana, the Frederic Church Museum. She has also worked as an arts consultant and writer for the New York State Council on the Arts, for whom she designed a grant category to support individual artists, and also coordinated a multi-year project to assist independent literary publishers. She has served as a panelist for The National Endowment for the Arts, The New York State Council on the Arts, and The New York Foundation for the Arts. Murray currently lives and works in Old Chatham, New York. ==Awards== * Prairie Schooner Glenna Luschei Award (2018) * National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship (2011\u201312) * Pushcart Prize, chosen by Ray Gonzalez and Philip Schultz (2008) * New York State Council on the Arts Museum Program Grant for Olana residency (2006) * National Poetry Series Open Competition Winner, chosen by Robert Bly (1999) * New York Foundation for the Arts Artist Fund Grant for play adaptation (1999) * National Endowment for the Arts Creation and Presentation Grant for Niagara residency (1998) * New York State Council on the Arts Writer in Residence Grant (1994) * Knight Foundation Fellowship at Yaddo for photography and verse collaboration (1994) * Poetry Society of America Gordon Barber Award Winner, chosen by Billy Collins (1993) * Poetry Society of America di Castagnola Award Runner-up, chosen by Joyce Carol Oates (1993) * Poetry Society of America di Castagnola Award Finalist, chosen by Marge Piercy (1992) * Winner, Wesleyan New Poets,Joan Murray: poet, writer, playwright, and editor by William Matthews, Pamela Alexander, Chase Twichell (1990) * National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship (1989\u20131990) * Academy of American Poets Walt Whitman Award Finalist, chosen by Amy Clampitt (1988) * New York Foundation for the Arts Poetry Fellowship (1988\u20131989) * New York State Council on the Arts Writer in Residence Grant (1984\u201385) * Pushcart Prize, chosen by Joyce Carol Oates (1984) * New York State Council on the Arts Writer in Residence Grant (1983\u201384) * Residencies at Yaddo, an artist's colony in upstate New York and The MacDowell Colony, an artist's colony in New Hampshire == Works == ===Books=== * , poetry collection * , poetry collection * (winner of the 1998 National Poetry Series), poetry collection * , novel in verse * (Wesleyan New Poets Series winner), poetry collection ===As editor=== * * * * , poetry co-editor == Footnotes == ==External links== *Joan Murray's Official Site *Murray's works *New York State Writers Institute page *Norton Poets Online page for Joan Murray *Online bio and Poem by Joan Murray at alittlepoetry.com *\"An Interview With Poet Joan Murray\", Poets & Writers, Kevin Larimer *Joan Murray Featured poet at alittlepoetry.com *Poetry Foundation * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from New York City Category:Hunter College alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:American women poets ",
