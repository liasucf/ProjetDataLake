Between August 1923 to August 1925 it was published as a monthly, then quarterly from January 1926 to June 1958, ceasing publication on O'Sullivan's death. The cover for the first issue was designed by artist Harry Clarke. The magazine featured fiction, poetry, drama and reviews and contributors included more or less every significant Irish writer of the period, including the playwright Samuel Beckett, the poet Austin Clarke, popular novelist Maurice Walsh, Padraic Fallon, Padraic Colum, Patrick Kavanagh and Blanaid Salkeld among others. It was re-issued from 1970-75 by John Ryan.http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm ==References== ==External links== * 1940 Dublin cartoon showing O'Sullivan and many of the magazine's contributors Category:Defunct magazines published in Ireland Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Europe Category:Literary magazines published in Ireland Category:Magazines established in 1923 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1975 Category:Monthly magazines published in Ireland Category:Quarterly magazines Category:Mass media in Dublin (city) ",
