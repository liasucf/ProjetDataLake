    "text": "Social parasitism is a pejorative that is leveled against a group or class which is considered to be detrimental to society. The term comes from the ancient Greek (par\u00e1sitos), \"one who lives at another's expense, person who eats at the table of another,\" used to label the social offender. (The term appeared in English in this sense, as a social label, in the 1530s; the later use of \"parasite\" as a biological metaphor developed from the early 17th century. ) For example, the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky was charged with social parasitism by the Soviet authorities. A 1964 trial found that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society. ==Usage== Depending on point of view, a social parasite may be one of several classes: Socialists have described members of the upper classes as economic parasites. The Russian lyrics of the socialist anthem \"The Internationale\" include a reference to parasites.For example, the Russian text reads: Only we, the workers of the all-world Great army of labor, Have the right to own the land, But parasites -- never! The German Nazis viewed \"races without homeland\" as \"parasitic races\" or \"Untermensch\" to be eliminated. These included Romani people and Jews.nazism.net, Nazi Ideological Theory. See Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, vol. 1 chapter 9 for prominent examples of the use of the word. The habitually \"work-shy\" (\"arbeitsscheu\") were imprisoned in concentration camps (see Black triangle (badge)). According to at least one commentator, it may be the new social paradigm\u2014involving class warfare and exploitation of electoral processes\u2014of myriad and disparate countries around the world. See Oligarchy, Kleptocracy and Elite capture. ===Soviet Union=== Russian poet Joseph Brodsky (1940\u20131996) was sentenced in 1964 to five years of banishment from Leningrad to Arkhangelsk Oblast for \"social parasitism\". In 1987 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. In the Soviet Union, which declared itself a workers' state, every adult able-bodied person was expected to work until official retirement. Thus unemployment was officially and theoretically eliminated. Those who refused to work, study or serve in another way risked being criminally charged with social parasitism ( tuneyadstvo, \u0442\u0443\u043d\u0435\u044f\u0434\u0446\u044b [tuneyadets/tuneyadetchi\"),Questions of criminal responsibility for the parasitic way of life (Russian), by B.G. Pavlov, Jurisprudence, Leningrad University in accordance with the socialist principle \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution.\" In 1961, 130,000 people were identified as leading the \"anti-social, parasitic way of life\" in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.Yevgenii Zhirnov, \u0412\u043d\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445 (To inflict helpful fear), (Russian), Kommersant, 2011-04-25(retrieved December 26, 2001) Charges of parasitism were frequently applied to dissidents and refuseniks, many of whom were intellectuals. Since their writings were considered against the regime, the state prevented them from obtaining employment. To avoid trials for parasitism, many of them took unskilled (but not especially time-consuming) jobs (street sweepers, firekeepers, etc.), which allowed them to continue their other pursuits.\"\u0417\u043b\u043e\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043e \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0435\" , a document of the Moscow Helsinki Group. === Belarus === Policies introduced in 2015, which observers noted as being reminiscent of Soviet-era initiatives, included a tax for those who were considered \"social parasites\". Defined as people working under 183 days in a year, and excluding home-makers and subsistence farmers, the deployment of the so-called parasite tax has been suspended after protests in several major urban centers. ==See also== *Cheating (biology) *Parasite single *Rent Seeking *Vagrancy (people) *Welfare dependency ==References== Category:Pejorative terms for people Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union Category:Soviet phraseology Category:Russian criminal law ",
