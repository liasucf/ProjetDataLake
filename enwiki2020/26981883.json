The ships were specifically designed to be able to service ships with nuclear propulsion or with gas turbines. The ships were also able to service the variety of guided missiles coming into service. They also had a helicopter platform aft, although only was later fitted with a hangar, when she served as flagship of the United States Sixth Fleet.Stefan Terzibatschitsch: Seemacht USA, Volume 2, Bechterm\u00fcnz Verlag, Augsburg (Germany), 1997, pp. 652-655. Both ships were originally armed with a World War II-vintage 5\"/38 caliber gun turret forward. The construction of two additional ships (AD-39, AD-40) was cancelled in 1969 and 1974. Paul H.
