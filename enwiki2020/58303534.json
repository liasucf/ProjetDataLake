The hotel was then frequented by Jean de La Fontaine and Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. The hotel was decorated by Le Sueur and Vicotte. From 1814 to 1857, the hotel was a sugar refinery. In 1857, Count Pierre de Lavalette bought the hotel and with architect Jules Gros transformed it into a Baroque Italo-Spanish pastiche, doubling the size of the right wing with sculpted decoration. At the end of 1872, rue de Turenne, some priests from the Oratory began to educate youth. However, it was only from 10 October 1877 that the \u00e9cole Massillon began. On 3 April 1877, abb\u00e9 Nouvelle bought the h\u00f4tel Fieubet. On 10 October of the same year, the building took its first 150 students.http://www.ecolemassillon.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=19&Itemid;=100014 File:P1220216 Paris IV hotel Fieubet detail rwk.jpg|One of the sphinxes above the door Image:\u00c9cole_Massillon,_Quai_des_Celestins,_Paris.jpg|Right wing of the building \u2014 Neo-baroque Italo-Spanish motifs facing rue du Petit-Musc which is located directly to the left.
