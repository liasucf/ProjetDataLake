    "text": "Aplocheiloidei is a suborder of the order Cyprinodontiformes consisting of three families which are commonly known as killifishes. ==Families== The three families within the suborder Aplocheiloidei are: * Aplocheilidae Bleeker, 1859 * Nothobranchiidae Garman, 1895 * Rivulidae Myers, 1925 ==Proposed taxonomy== Some authorities have lumped the three families into a single family, Aplocheilidae, a well-established name, chosen for its stability in usage over time, and to avoid the impact of a new name at the family rank for a popular aquarium fish group. Under this proposal, the Aplocheilidae includes three subfamilies: Aplocheilinae for the species from Asia, Madagascar and the Seychelles; Cynolebiinae (called Rivulidae above) for the species from the Americas; and Nothobranchiinae for the species from the African mainland. Phylogenetic relationships among 13 taxa of the Cynopoecilini and four outgroup taxa == References == Category:Cyprinodontiformes Category:Taxa named by Lynne R. Parenti ",
