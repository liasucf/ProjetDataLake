Fort Morris was constructed in Sunbury by the authority of the Continental Congress. A contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778. The American contingent at Fort Morris was led by Colonel John McIntosh (c. 1748\u20131826).GlynnGen.com Coastal Georgia Genealogy Page on John McIntosh The Americans numbered only 127 Continental soldiers plus militiamen and local citizens. The fort itself was crudely constructed and could not have withstood any concerted attack. The British commander, Colonel Fuser, demanded Fort Morris' surrender through a written note to the American rebels. Though clearly outnumbered (he had only about 200 men plus artillery), Colonel McIntosh's defiant written response to the British demand included the following line: \"As to surrendering the fort, receive this laconic reply: COME AND TAKE IT!\". The British declined to attack, in large part due to their lack of intelligence regarding other forces in the area. Colonel Fuser believed a recent skirmish in the area, combined with Colonel McIntosh's bravado, might have reflected reinforcements and so the British withdrew. The British returned in January 1779 with a larger force. They later conquered and controlled nearly all of Georgia for the next few years.North Georgia History Col. McIntosh's defiance was one successful and heroic event which inspired the patriots as the War moved to the Carolinas and then north. The Fort Morris Historical Marker is on Martin Road, Midway, Georgia. It is located at the visitor center for the Fort Morris Historic Site. The center is located off Fort Morris Road, at the end of the Colonels Island Highway (Georgia Route 38). The marker memorializes the battle and notes the \"Come and Take It!\" response. In recognition of his valor of defending Fort Morris in Sunbury, McIntosh was awarded a sword by the Georgia Legislature with the words \"Come and Take It\" engraved on the blade.Lucien Lamar Knight, Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials, and Legends ...: Under the code duello... pages 500\u2013501 McIntosh later served in the War of 1812 as an American General, still protecting the Georgia coast. He served honorably, receiving honors from the City of Savannah for his service. ==Texas Revolution== The Come and Take It flag In early January 1831, Green DeWitt wrote to Ram\u00f3n M\u00fasquiz, the top political official of Bexar, and requested armament for defense of the colony of Gonzales. This request was granted by delivery of a small used cannon. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for on March 10, 1831, by James Tumlinson, Jr. The swivel cannon was mounted to a blockhouse in Gonzales and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales\u2014the first land battle of the Texas Revolution against Mexico\u2014a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders from Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase \"come and take it\" along with a black star and an image of the cannon that they had received four years earlier from Mexican officials. This was the same message that was sent to the Mexican government when they told the Texans to return the cannon; lack of compliance with the initial demands led to the failed attempt by the Mexican military to forcefully take back the cannon. Replicas of the original flag can be seen in the Texas State Capitol, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, the Sam Houston State University CJ Center, the University of Texas at El Paso Library, the Marine Military Academy headquarters building, the Hockaday School Hoblitzelle Auditorium, and in Perkins Library at Duke University. touch-hole detail Detail from the monument in Gonzales, Texas ==References== ==External links== * * Gonzales Flag as designed in 1835 Category:American political catchphrases Category:Slogans Category:Quotations from military Category:Texas Revolution Category:Flags of the United States Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 19th century ",
