    "text": "Big Noon Kickoff is a college football studio show broadcast by Fox. Premiering on August 31, 2019, it serves as a pre-game show for Fox College Football, and in particular, Big Noon Saturday\u2014the network's new weekly 12:00 p.m ET/9:00 a.m PT kickoff window. It is hosted by Rob Stone, and features former Utah, Florida, and Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, former USC running back Reggie Bush, 2004 Heisman Trophy winner and former USC quarterback Matt Leinart, and former Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn as panelists, with Bruce Feldman acting as Fox\u2019s CFB insider, 1997 Heisman Trophy winner and former Michigan cornerback Charles Woodson joining on some weeks, and Tom Verducci doing feature reports. Occasionally, whenever Stone is on assignments for Fox, Kevin Burkhardt will fill in for Stone. == History == In the 2013 season, Fox aired a college football pre-game show on its Fox Sports 1 channel, Fox College Saturday. The program was unable to compete with ESPN's popular and established College GameDay, with Fox only being able to sustain an average viewership of 70,000. The show was cancelled after a single season, and its role was supplanted by the Friday-night edition of Fox Sports Live. Fox introduced the Big Noon Saturday window for its college football coverage in the 2019 season; the network had aired occasional noon kickoffs during the season before (including, after having acquired the Big Ten's primary football rights in 2017, the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry), and they were among Fox's top-viewed games in the 2018 season. Fox has positioned the timeslot as featuring one of its flagship games of the day. Big Noon Kickoff was henceforth introduced as a pre-game show for the new window. Sports Illustrated described the show as being \"built around\" Urban Meyer (who retired as head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes at the end of the 2018 season, and had previously been an ESPN analyst). Meyer stated that he had prepared for the role by studying clips of Fox's NFL pre-game show Fox NFL Sunday, and Alex Rodriguez (who joined ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball in 2018), as an example of another player-turned-television analyst. Fox executive producer Brad Zager explained that his presence was meant to help provide \"intelligent dialogue\" to the show. For 2020, despite starting with mostly Big 12 games, due to the Big Ten starting their season on October 23rd, Big Noon Kickoff expanded to two hours, to continue competing against College GameDay. == Reception == The Big Lead felt that Big Noon Kickoff showed promise, but that the show's \"formal\" and \"corporate\" atmosphere (in comparison to the \"casual fun\" of College GameDay) led to most of the panelists seeming \"stiff\" on-air, and exacerbated their relative lack of broadcasting experience. Quinn was considered to be a stand-out among the panelists in its premiere broadcast, considering him the most \"comfortable\" on-air, and noting that both him and Meyer were well-versed at leveraging their past experience to provide insights. == Viewership == During the first episode, the show garnered 838,000 viewers, which amounted to a 0.8 rating. A special two-hour edition of Big Noon Kickoff leading into the Michigan-Ohio State game on November 30, 2019 received a series-high 1.6 overnight rating, beating College GameDay (which drew a 1.54 rating) in its time slot for the first time in the program's history. == On-location broadcasts == Unlike College GameDay, Big Noon Kickoff does not regularly do remote broadcasts, preferring to originate from the Fox Sports studio in Los Angeles. However, the show has occasionally done on- location broadcasts, particularly as a lead-in to major games. On November 23, 2019, the show scheduled an on-location edition from Columbus, Ohio for the Ohio State/Penn State rivalry game, which ESPN also chose as its site for College GameDay that week. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Date ! colspan=\"2\" |Host ! colspan=\"2\" |Visitor !Stadium !City !Notes |- |September 20, 2019 (Friday) |style=\"\"|USC |30 |style=\"\"|#10 Utah |23 |Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum |Los Angeles, CA |First Big Noon Kickoff road show, game on FS1 |- |October 12, 2019 |style=\"\"|#11 Texas* |27 |style=\"\"|#6 Oklahoma |34 |Cotton Bowl |Dallas, TX |Red River Rivalry, 2-hour show |- |October 26, 2019 |style=\"\"|#3 Ohio State |38 |style=\"\"|#13 Wisconsin |7 |Ohio Stadium |Columbus, OH | |- |November 23, 2019 |style=\"\"|#2 Ohio State |28 |style=\"\"|#8 Penn State |17 |Ohio Stadium |Columbus, OH |Ohio State\u2013Penn State rivalry, 2-hour show |- | November 30, 2019 |style=\"\"|#13 Michigan |27 |style=\"\"|#1 Ohio State |56 |Michigan Stadium |Ann Arbor, MI |The Game, 2-hour show (Also live from Michigan on November 29th, before Texas Tech-Texas) |- |December 7, 2019 |style=\"\"|#8 Wisconsin* |21 |style=\"\"|#1 Ohio State |34 |Lucas Oil Stadium |Indianapolis, IN |Big Ten Championship Game, 8:00 PM kickoff |- | October 24, 2020 |style=\"\"|Ohio State | |style=\"\"|Nebraska | |Ohio Stadium |Columbus, OH |2020 Big Ten season opener |- |November 7, 2020 |style=\"\"|USC | |style=\"\"|Arizona State | |Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum |Los Angeles, CA | |} Winners listed in BOLD * denotes a neutral site host Rankings from AP Poll and CFP Rankings (once released) released prior to game == See also == * Fox NFL Kickoff ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:Fox Sports Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:College football studio shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Saturday mass media ",
