Seligman received his bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University of Rochester and his PhD in 1954 from Yale University under Nathan Jacobson with thesis Lie algebras of prime characteristic. After he received his PhD he was a Henry Burchard Fine Instructor at Princeton University from 1954\u20131956. In 1956 he became an instructor and from 1965 a full professor at Yale, where he was chair of the mathematics department from 1974 to 1977. For the academic year 1958/59 he was a Fulbright Lecturer at the University of M\u00fcnster. His doctoral students include James E. Humphreys and Daniel K. Nakano. Since 1959 he has been married to Irene Schwieder and the couple has two daughters. ==Selected works== ===Books=== *On Lie algebras of prime characteristic, American Mathematical Society, 1956 *Liesche Algebren, Schriftenreihe des Mathematischen Instituts der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster, 1959 *Modular Lie Algebras, Springer Verlag 1967 *Rational methods in Lie algebras, Marcel Dekker 1976 *Rational constructions of modules for simple Lie algebras, American Mathematical Society 1981 *Construction of Lie Algebras and their Modules, Springer Verlag 1988 ===Articles=== * * * * * * * * ==References== Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Algebraists Category:University of Rochester alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Yale University faculty ",
