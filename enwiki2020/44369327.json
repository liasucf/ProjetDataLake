Jason Lewis won the district's Republican primary, defeating opponents Matthew Erickson, John Howe, and Darlene Miller. Democrat Angela Craig, who served as vice president of global human resources for St. Jude Medical, resigned her position in January 2015 to challenge Lewis. Mary Lawrence, a doctor, also ran as a Democrat but dropped out before the primary. Commentators wrote that the election was \"likely to be one of the most-watched congressional races in the country,\" (MinnPost), \"expected to be one of the most competitive in the country\", according to Roll Call newspaper, and \"seen as a prime target for Democrats to flip\" according to The Atlantic. Area left- wing weekly City Pages described the campaign as resembling the 2016 presidential campaign, calling Lewis \"an entrepreneur and media personality, whose blunt rhetoric is refreshingly honest to some, simply offensive to others\", and describing Craig as \"a tough female leader with moderate positions, ties to big business, and a penchant for pantsuits\". In May 2016, the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report changed its rating of the race from \"pure tossup\" to \"tossup/tilt Democratic,\" with political analyst Nathan Gonzales writing that Craig \"is probably to the left of the district in her ideology, but she has a good story to tell, is raising considerable money (she had $1.3 million in the bank at the end of March) and is solid as a candidate.\" Other political prognosticators rated the race \"Republican Toss- up\" (Charlie Cook), and \"pure\" toss-up (Larry Sabato's \"Crystal Ball\"), according to MinnPost. Lewis ended up defeating Craig by several thousand votes in the November.election.http://electionresults.sos.state.mn.us/Results/USRepresentative/100?officeinelectionid=10735&districtid;=557 ===Republican primary=== ====Candidates==== ;Declared * John Howe, former state senator, former mayor of Red Wing and candidate for Minnesota Secretary of State in 2014 * Jason Lewis, political commentator, former talk radio host and nominee for CO-02 in 1990 * Darlene Miller, president and CEO of Permac Industries and member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness * Matthew Erickson, Minnesota spokesperson for Donald Trump ;Withdrawn * David Benson-Staebler, political consultant, former Democratic congressional aide and real estate agent * David Gerson, engineer and candidate in 2012 and 2014 * Pam Myhra, former state representative and candidate for lieutenant governor in 2014 ;Declined * Tony Albright, state representative * Ted Daley, former state senator * Steve Drazkowski, state representative * Pat Garofalo, state representative * John Kline, incumbent U.S. Representative * John Kriesel, former state representative * Mike McFadden, businessman and nominee for U.S. Senate in 2014 * Mary Pawlenty, former Dakota County District Court Judge and former First Lady of Minnesota * Roz Peterson, state representative * Eric Pratt, state senator * Steve Sviggum, former Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives * Dave Thompson, state senator and candidate for governor in 2014 ====Endorsements==== ====Results==== ===Democratic primary=== ====Candidates==== ;Declared * Angie Craig, former St. Jude Medical executive ;Withdrawn * Roger Kittelson, dairy marketing specialist, nominee for WI-06 in 2008 and candidate for Minnesota House of Representatives in 1982 and 2014 * Mary Lawrence, ophthalmologist ;Declined * Joe Atkins, state representative * Rick Hansen, state representative * Mike Obermueller, former state representative and nominee in 2012 and 2014 ====Endorsements==== ====Results==== ===General election=== ====Polling==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign= bottom !

It was Nolan's second victory over Mills, who unsuccessfully challenged Nolan in the 2014 election. Though Nolan's margin of victory in 2016 (2,009 votes) was too large to trigger a publicly funded automatic recount, Mills, as of late November 2016, has said that he plans to request and pay for a hand recount of all votes cast in the eighth district, as is his right under law. Mills plans to cover the cost of the recount\u2014just over $100,000\u2014 himself. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Minnesota has not seen a recount in a race for the House of Representatives since the year 2000, when election day totals in Minnesota's 2nd congressional district fell within the half percentage point threshold, thus triggering a state funded recount. It is not known if Mills's request for a privately funded recount has precedent in Minnesota's electoral history, at least as it pertains to elections for the House of Representatives. ===General election=== ====Endorsements==== ====Polling==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign= bottom !
