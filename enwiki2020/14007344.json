    "text": "\"Pencil Thin Mustache\" is a song written and performed by American popular music singer songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was released as a single (b/w \"Brand New Country Star\") on Dunhill D-15011 in August 1974. It was first released on his album of 1974, Living & Dying in \u00be Time. It \"bubbled under\" the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 101, and reached No. 44 on the Easy Listening Chart. The song, written in a Western swing style, is a nostalgic look by Buffett back at the popular culture of his childhood. The title refers to the type of mustache worn by the film character, Boston Blackie. Buffett refers to a number of other persons, characters, and products of the period, including Ricky Ricardo, Andy Devine, Sky (King)'s niece Penny, American Bandstand, Disneyland, Ramar of the Jungle, Bwana, Errol Flynn, the Sheik of Araby, and Brylcreem. The lyrics also say that in the 1950s, \"only jazz musicians were smokin' marijuana\".http://www.songlyrics.com/jimmy-buffett/pencil-thin- mustache-lyrics/ Buffett has stated that \"the thing about writing a song like this is that the older you get, the more people there are who need an explanation of the characters in the song. I shudder to think how old Sky King's niece Penny is today. It all started with that two toned Ricky Ricardo jacket. I can't wait for them to come back.\" \"Pencil Thin Mustache\" is a popular song with Buffett fans, and is often played at concerts, but is not part of \"The Big 8\" songs that he has played at almost all of his concerts. Recorded live versions of the song appear on You Had to Be There and Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays. Billboard described the song as \"very well done and quite funny.\" ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1974) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|101 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks |align=\"center\"|44 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singleshttps://www.billboard.com/music/jimmy-buffett/chart-history/CSI/2 |align=\"center\"|58 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Top Singles |align=\"center\"|75 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks |align=\"center\"|22 |} ==Notes== ==External links== *Lyrics at BuffettWorld.com * Category:1974 songs Category:Jimmy Buffett songs Category:Songs written by Jimmy Buffett Category:Western swing songs ",
