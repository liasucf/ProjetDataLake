    "text": "Luigi Rabat\u00e0 (1443 - 8 May 1490) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest from the Order of Carmelites. He served as prior of his convent of Randazzo until his death which occurred after an attack in which an arrow was shot into his head. Rabat\u00e0's beatification was confirmed on 10 December 1841 after Pope Gregory XVI confirmed that the late priest had a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) that was enduring. ==Life== Luigi Rabat\u00e0 was born in Erice in 1443. Rabat\u00e0 became a member of the Carmelites at the convent of the Annunziata sometime in his adolescence and was later ordained as a priest before being appointed as the prior of the convent of Randazzo. He distinguished himself for giving alms to the poor and was known for his penances. In 1490 an attacker - said to be Antonio Catalucci \\- struck him in the head with an arrow and he forgave his attacker and refused to mention his name for fear the individual in question would receive a harsh punishment. The reason for the attack was that Rabat\u00e0 had denounced the extravagant dress of a local lord (said to be Catalucci's brother or father). He died after several months of great pain following this attack. His remains were housed under the main altar of the church at the convent in Trapani in 1640 while some of his relics were relocated to Erice in 1617. His remains were then transferred to an urn under the altar of the Assumption in the Basilica di Santa Maria on 13 August 1913. ==Beatification== Processes for his beatification opened in Randazzo in 1533 and then other processes followed in 1573 while the title of Servant of God was bestowed upon him under Pope Clement VII in 1533 with the commencement of the cause. Rabat\u00e0 received formal beatification from Pope Gregory XVI on 10 December 1841 following official papal confirmation that the late Carmelite priest had a longstanding 'cultus' (or popular devotion) that proved to be enduring. ==References== ==External links== *Saints SQPN Category:1443 births Category:1490 deaths Category:15th-century venerated Christians Category:15th- century Roman Catholic priests Category:15th-century Italian people Category:Beatifications by Pope Gregory XVI Category:Carmelites Category:Carmelite beatified people Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Trapani Category:Venerated Catholics ",
