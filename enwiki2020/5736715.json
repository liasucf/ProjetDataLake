The team president and owner is Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr, a famous former NHL player, who is currently (2019\u201320) playing in home games for the team in addition to his ownership and administrative roles. The team plays its home games at \u010cEZ Stadion Kladno. ==History== Ryt\u00ed\u0159i Kladno players (2017) Kladno was a particularly strong team in the late 1970s, when it won four consecutive league titles (1975\u20131978), and again in 1980. The team's star, Milan Nov\u00fd, was league MVP in 1977, 1981, and 1982, and won six scoring titles. Franti\u0161ek Posp\u00ed\u0161il was league MVP in 1971 and 1972. Before season 1997/1998 happened what everyone expected for some time, Kladno lost its longtime sponsor, ironworks Hu\u0165 Poldi. After a long time the Poldi disappeared from Kladno hockey jerseys and the successes that this famous club has achieved in previous years have also disappeared and was de facto always last. Primarily the lack of funds did not allow to management improvement of club cadre and the main coach resigned. Despite the departure of a number of players abroad, Kladno did not go bad after 2003 and celebrated return to the Czech highest-level league. However after the season 2012-13 Kladno performed poorly in the extraliga. Nor the withdrawal of coaches helped, and the co-sponsorship of Rene Burger the team reached the highest league again after the 12 years. Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr played for his hometown Kladno for parts of four seasons, including during the NHL lockouts in 1994, 2004, and 2012. In January 2018, J\u00e1gr was assigned to HC Kladno after a partial season with the Calgary Flames. During the 2010\u20132011 season, the team was docked 6 points for having used players who were not correctly registered to the club, an affair which also involved the clubs BK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav and HC Plze\u0148. ==Club names== * 1924 \u2013 HOSK Kladno * 1948 \u2013 Sokol Kladno * 1977 \u2013 Poldi SONP Kladno * 1995 \u2013 HC Poldi Kladno * 1997 \u2013 HC Velvana Kladno * 2000 \u2013 HC Vagnerplast Kladno * 2003 \u2013 HC Rabat Kladno * 2007 \u2013 HC GEUS OKNA Kladno * 2010 \u2013 HC Vagnerplast Kladno * 2011 \u2013 Ryt\u00ed\u0159i Kladno ==Summary of league participations== * 1951\u20131953: First Ice Hockey League (highest-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1953\u20131955: Celost\u00e1tn\u00ed sout\u011b\u017e (second-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1955\u20131983: First Ice Hockey League (highest-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1983\u20131985: 1. \u010cNHL (second-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1985\u20131986: First Ice Hockey League (highest-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1986\u20131987: 1. \u010cNHL (second-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1987\u20131993: First Ice Hockey League (highest-level league in Czechoslovakia) * 1993\u20132002: Czech Extraliga (highest-level league in the Czech Republic) * 2002\u20132003: 1st Czech Republic Hockey League (second-level league in the Czech Republic) * 2003\u20132014: Czech Extraliga (highest-level league in the Czech Republic) * 2014\u20132019 : WSM Liga (second-level league in the Czech Republic) * 2019\u2013 : Czech Extraliga (highest-level league in the Czech Republic) ==Honours== ===Domestic=== Czech Extraliga * 3rd place (1): 1993\u201394 Czech 1.
