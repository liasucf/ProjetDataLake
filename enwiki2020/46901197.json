    "text": "Marcus Michael Douglas Behmer (1 October 1879 in Weimar \u2013 12 September 1958 in Berlin) was a German writer and book illustrator, graphic designer and painter. ==Biography== ===Early life and family=== Marcus Behmer was a son of the painter Hermann Behmer (born 13 November 1831 in Merzien ; died in July 1915 in Weimar ) and a grandson of Merziener Oberamt's Friedrich Behmer and his wife Elise Behmer, youngest daughter of the poet Philippine Engelhard. His uncle Rudolf Behmer (born 13 November 1831 in Merzien; 12 February 1902 in Berlin ) \u2013 known as a breeder of Merino sheep \u2013 was the twin brother of his father. Their sister Louise, the aunt of Marcus was with Heinrich von Nathusius married (1824\u20131890). His brother Joachim Behmer was also active as an artist. ===Life=== Marcus Behmer's grave in Friedhof Heerstra\u00dfe, Berlin- Westend His artistic beginnings were, as he writes in a letter, in 1896, with his first major success with the illustrations for Wilde's Salome for Insel- Verlag, in 1903. The early works show the influence of Illustration Art Aubrey Beardsley. In the past reception it is this initial dependence in his Salome 's undoing, since many art historians call Behmer afterwards, but the later the inaccurate, as Beardsley epigones. It is true that he soon broke away from this influence and in parallel with the rise of Expressionism and the new impulses of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte developed only its inherent design. On 1 October 1903, Behmer entered military service, was appointed a corporal on 10 June 1904 and promoted on 22 September 1907 to sergeant. From 1914 he participated in WWI (in Flanders and in Poland). In the summer of 1917 he fell seriously ill \"after an operation in the field\" and spent six weeks in the military hospital at Jarny. During his time in the army, he produced many so- called \"comrades' portraits\" , usually miniatures, although finely crafted profile views of young soldiers. From 1902 Behmer did Illustrations for books, designed initials and writings and was responsible for carefully planned book facilities. He worked for the Cranach Press of Count Harry Kessler, and did illustrations in numerous articles for the monthly magazine \" Die Insel\" (The Island ) for Insel-Verlag . For this publisher he also designed an internationally especially perceived work Illustration consequence to Philipp Otto Runge : The Fisherman un Fru syner . Behmer also worked for other publishers, such as the Paul Cassirer house, where one of his major works was the 40 etchings produced in 1912 for an edition of Voltaire's Zadig. Like many book illustrators, Behmer ran into financial difficulties in the 1920s, but stayed committed to the (in his words) \"small format\" , as did others such as Alfred Kubin (with whom Behmer was compared in later years) and as opposed to a more competitive career as a gallery artist. Behmer was close friends with, among others, the family of the writer Ernst Hardt, with the painter Alexander Olbricht and also with the sculptor and painter Dorothea Werner (born Leiding) and her husband. Starting in 1903, he was a member of the first homosexual organization in the world in Berlin . Until now, it was little known that Behmer was sentenced in April 1937 by a court in Konstanz to two years in prison and was arrested in Freiburg and other places in southern Germany. At times he was given the opportunity to work as an artist in prison. The works produced in this period are mostly calligraphic designed tablets with Greek text (prayers and Bible quotes), and drawings full of bitterness and irony. From 1943 Behmer lived at the family home of Donata Helmrich, the daughter of Ernst Hardt, in Berlin-Charlottenburg. After he was bombed out in Berlin in early 1944, he went late that autumn to Gro\u1e9e Nuhnen, the estate of the Werner family in Frankfurt / Oder. The rest of his life was spent in West Berlin. Dorothea Werner took care of him from 1958 until his death. Renowned Museums and collections such as the graphic collection of the St\u00e4del Museum in Frankfurt, the Klingspor Museum for calligraphy and typography in Offenbach or the collection Sternweiler in Berlin today house works by Marcus Behmer. A critical appraisal of his work is only now being undertaken and his art- historical importance realized. ==Works== ===Graphics=== *Numerous usually etched bookplate. *Numerous sent to friends, mostly etchings, New Year's wishes with both metaphorical and political motives (as arise between 1931 and 1934 critical comments to seize power by the National Socialists). *Numerous erotic works, often etchings, with so clear as imaginative gay symbolism. ===Book illustrations=== *Annemarie von Nathusius: Free words .
