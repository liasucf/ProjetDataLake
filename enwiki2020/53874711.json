    "text": "Euthanasia is the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering, while assisted suicide, also known as physician-assisted suicide, is suicide committed with the aid of a physician. Assisted suicide is often confused with euthanasia. In cases of euthanasia the physician administers the means of death, usually a lethal drug. In assisted suicide, it is required that the person voluntarily expresses their wish to die, and also makes a request for medication for the purpose of ending their life. Assisted suicide thus involves a person\u2019s self-administration of deadly drugs that are supplied by a doctor. The legality of euthanasia and assisted suicide varies. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) and involuntary euthanasia is illegal in all countries. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Colombia and Luxembourg, and was previously legal in the Northern Territory. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, Germany and Japan. It is also legal in the Australian states of Victoria and Western Australia, and in the US jurisdictions of Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Vermont, Montana, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Washington DC and California. This list contains notable people who have died via either legal voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide.
