    "text": "Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting CorporationIndustrial Directory of New York State, 1949ed, 1953ed was one of the first (3) three, largest, world-class, top manufacturers of fluorescent lighting fixtures in the United States, and became the Saks Fifth Avenue of the industry, from the time of the public introduction of the fluorescent lamp at the 1939 World's Fair. Being a pioneer of fluorescent fixture manufacturing, various designs and shapes of fixtures were tried by the company in the beginning with various bulb shapes being introduced until it was settled upon that the liner design was the most desirable to customers. Artcraft announced a liner showcase striplight fixture and slimline ballast in 1946, which became widely accepted decades later as the world industry standard.Electrical Consultant, Volume 50, Page 4, 1946 - Lighting, Volume 53 & 54, Page 174, 175, 1948Westinghouse Engineer, Volume 12-13, Page 141, 1952 Louis Levy started the business from money earned by assembling radios, and later as a salesman of radios, when he was about 20 years old. He was very intuitive. Louis Levy and Max Wittenberg started the Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation about 1940.Bernard Luger, CFO, Documenting a corporation, Sillman Family Private Collection, 1995 Wittenberg managed the business, sales, and accounting office and Levy managed the manufacturing, fixture development, and production department. Fluorescent lighting was very new to consumers, businesses, and professionals, who were familiar with incandescent lighting.John H. Campbell, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, The University of California, Berkeley, California, The History and Technical Evolution of High Frequency Lighting, pages 1-2, 1977 The transition to this newer form of lighting was not easy. The benefits of fluorescent lighting were lower operating costs, more light for the same power input, and less maintenance.Mark Stanley Rea, PH.D. FIES, Editor-In-Chief, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Lighting Handbook and Reference, 1993 The idea took hold.Arthur A. Bright and Rupert Maclaurin, Economic Factors Influencing The Development and Introduction of The Fluorescent Lamp, The Journal of Political Economy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, [MIT], University of Chicago Press, 51, No.5, 1943, pp. 429-450 The Company had over 200 employees at the factory and branch offices. Starting about 1959, neon signs also were manufactured. The Company began selling fixtures in the New York City area. They opened showroom offices in Manhattan, and then in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, PA about 1947, and began making and selling display cases and electric fans. Some customers opted for being on the installment plan, which was a growing trend then. Artcraft's strength in manufacturing skyrocketed by the mid-1950s east of the Mississippi, and many other companies were beginning to make fixtures. Max Wittenberg died in the late 1950s and Levy continued operations with a new partner until about 1968 when he sold the corporation. He was interested in going into the finance business.Suzanne Sillman, An employee's perspective, Sillman Family Private Collection, 1996 The Company remained in existence until about 2002 in Brooklyn, NY.New York State, Division of Corporations, State Records Electrical Const ad 1948 1948 ad The corporation's sales multiplied exponentially like wildfire in the New York region and after 13 years, all over the entire United States and was at its pinnacle in 1952. Artcraft received the prestigious \"AAA\" Dun & Bradstreet rating many times, which is a quality hallmark in business and Artcraft was very proud to achieve. Fewer than 10% of US corporations ever attain that status. While overseeing Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Payroll, Profit & Loss Statements, banking correspondence, extension of credit to customers together with two full-time accountants and five to seven bookkeepers and support staff, among other duties, it was apparent the corporation was a profitable entity with Louis Levy and Max Wittenberg being the sole owners. Company stock offerings were becoming popular, and issuance began with the employees yet not on the major exchanges. Very few businesses had that credit rating for an extended duration, analogous to a 5A, ER3, 1 rating today.
