    "text": "34 Battalion was a light infantry battalion that was part of the SWATF. ==History== 34 Battalion was commonly known as the \"Kavangoland Battalion\". It was established in 1975 as 1 Kavango Battalion as a ceremonial guard of honour. It was then renamed 34 Battalion . ===Operational Area=== 34 Battalions main base was at Rundu, but there was an outside base at Mashari, approx east of Rundu, where Charlie and Delta companies were routinely stationed. The Mashari base was in an old TB hospital. They were co-located with a BRUSH unit.(Bush Reconnaissance Unit Signal HQ) As part of Sector 20, their main area of responsibility was from Rundu West as far as Sector 10 and East up to the Bagani bridge. ===Personnel=== Initially 34 Battalion was manned primarily with Kavango troops but later with a large number of turned SWAPO Cadres. The first Kavango instructors were trained in 1979. The first Kavango officer was commissioned in 1980 and the first group of sergeants were promoted that same year. ===Structure=== 34 Battalion generally consisted of: * a HQ, * a Support Company, * 4 Line Companies (Buffel APC), * and an Armoured Reconnaissance wing of 2 Platoons and 4 Eland 90s. There was usually also an attached SA Army Infantry Company. 34 Battalion's role was primarily that of light infantry, with some mounted (berede) troops and a Romeo Mike team (Afrikaans Reaksie Mag). ===Engagements=== The unit had its first skirmish in 1979. Thereafter they took part in most of the major operations in the operational area. They were credited with completely suppressing all insurgency activities in the Kavango region by 1987. ===Renaming=== The South West Africa Territory Force SWATFhttp://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/AG1977/AG1977-A5-63-16-004-jpeg.pdf renumbered battalion numbers according to their geographical positioning on the border. The prefix 10 pertained to battalions operating to the west of the Kavango River, 20 to the Kavango or central region and 70 to the eastern region. Under this system, 34 Battalion was renamed 202 Battalion in 1980.
