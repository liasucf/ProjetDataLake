    "text": "The Dakota (pronounced , Dakota language: Dak\u021f\u00f3ta/Dakh\u00f3ta) are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government in North America. They compose two of the three main subcultures of the Sioux people, and are typically divided into the Eastern Dakota and the Western Dakota. The Eastern Dakota are the Santee (Is\u00e1\u014byathi or Is\u00e1\u014b-athi; \"knife\" + \"encampment\", \u2033dwells at the place of knife flint\u2033), who reside in the eastern Dakotas, central Minnesota and northern Iowa. They have federally recognized tribes established in several places. The Western Dakota are the Yankton, and the Yanktonai (Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b and Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna; \"Village-at-the-end\" and \"Little village-at- the-end\"), who reside in the Upper Missouri River area. The Yankton-Yanktonai are collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi\u010dh\u00edyena (\u2033Those Who Speak Like Men\u2033). They also have distinct federally recognized tribes. In the past the Western Dakota have been erroneously classified as Nakota, a branch of the Sioux who moved further west. The latter are now located in Montana and across the border in Canada, where they are known as Stoney.For a report on the long- established blunder of misnaming the Yankton and the Yanktonai as \"Nakota\", see the article Nakota ==Name== The word Dakota means \"ally\" in the Dakota language, and their autonyms include Ik\u010d\u00e9 Wi\u010dh\u00e1\u0161ta (\"Indian people\") and Dakh\u00f3ta Oy\u00e1te (\"Dakota people\").Barry M. Pritzker, A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000; pg. 316 ==History== Before the 17th century, the Santee Dakota (; \"Knife\" also known as the Eastern Dakota) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. They gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish. Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota, where the Western Dakota (Yankton, Yanktonai) and Teton (Lakota) were residing. In the 1800s, the Dakota signed treaties with the United States, ceding much of their land in Minnesota. Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time, as well as low food supplies, led to the Dakota War of 1862, which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Canada. After 1870, the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota, creating the present-day reservations in the state. The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota ( and ; \"Village-at-the-end\" and \"Little village-at-the-end\"), collectively also referred to by the endonym , resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858. Despite ceding their lands, their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry, which is the cultural center of the Sioux people. They are considered to be the Western Dakota (also called middle Sioux), and have in the past been erroneously classified as Nakota.for a report on the long-established blunder of misnaming as \"Nakota\", the Yankton and the Yanktonai, see the article Nakota The actual Nakota are the Assiniboine and Stoney of Western Canada and Montana. ==Ethnic groups== The Eastern and Western Dakota are two of the three groupings belonging to the Sioux nation (also called Dakota in a broad sense), the third being the Lakota (Th\u00edt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b or Teton). The three groupings speak dialects that are still relatively mutually intelligible. This is referred to as a common language, Dakota-Lakota, or Sioux.Parks, Douglas R.; & Rankin, Robert L., \"The Siouan languages\"; in DeMallie, R.J. (ed) (2001). Handbook of North American Indians: Plains (Vol. 13, Part 1, pp. 94\u2013114) [W. C. Sturtevant (Gen. Ed.)]. Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Institution: pp. 97 ff; . The other two languages of the Dakotan dialect continuum, Assiniboine and Stoney (spoken by the Nakota or Nakoda peoples), have grown widely or completely unintelligible to Dakota and Lakota speakers. The Dakota include the following bands: Zitkala-Sa (1876\u20141938), Yankton author, photographed by Joseph Keiley * Santee division (Eastern Dakota) (Is\u00e1\u014byathi, meaning \"knife camp\") ** Mdewakanton (Bdew\u00e9kha\u014bthu\u014bwa\u014b \"Spirit Lake Village\" or \"people of the mystic lake\") **: notable persons: Taoyateduta ** Sisseton (Sis\u00edthu\u014bwa\u014b, translating to \"swamp/lake/fish scale village\") ** Wahpekute (Wa\u021fp\u00e9khute, \"Leaf Archers\") **:notable persons: Inkpaduta ** Wahpeton (Wa\u021fp\u00e9thu\u014bwa\u014b, \"Leaf Village\") * Yankton-Yanktonai division (Western Dakota) (Wi\u010dh\u00edyena) ** Yankton (Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014b, \"End Village\") ** Yanktonai (Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014bna, \"Little End Village\") ***Upper Yanktonai ***H\u00fa\u014bkpathina or Lower Yanktonainot to be confused with the Oglala thiy\u00f3\u0161paye bearing the same name, \"H\u00fa\u014bkpathila\" ===Santee (Is\u00e1\u014byathi or Eastern Dakota)=== The Santee migrated north and westward from the Southeast United States, first into Ohio, then to Minnesota. Some came up from the Santee River and Lake Marion, area of South Carolina. The Santee River was named after them, and some of their ancestors' ancient earthwork mounds have survived along the portion of the dammed-up river that forms Lake Marion. In the past, they were a Woodland people who thrived on hunting, fishing and farming. Migrations of Ojibwe people from the east in the 17th and 18th centuries, with muskets supplied by the French and British, pushed the Dakota further into Minnesota and west and southward. The US gave the name \"Dakota Territory\" to the northern expanse west of the Mississippi River and up to its headwaters. In the 21st century, the majority of the Santee live on reservations, reserves, and communities in Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Canada. Some have moved to cities for more work opportunities. After the Dakota War of 1862, the federal government expelled the Santee from Minnesota. Many were sent to Crow Creek Indian Reservation. In 1864 some from the Crow Creek Reservation were sent to St. Louis and then by boat up the Missouri River, ultimately to the Santee Sioux Reservation. The Bdew\u00e1ka\u014bthu\u014bwa\u014b (Mdewakanton) live predominantly at the Prairie Island and Shakopee reservations in Minnesota. ===Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014b- Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014bna (Yankton-Yanktonai or Western Dakota)=== The Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014b- Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014bna, also known by the anglicized spelling Yankton (Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014b: \"End village\") and Yanktonai (Ih\u00e1\u014bkthu\u014bwa\u014bna: \"Little end village\") divisions consist of two bands or two of the seven council fires. According to Nasunatanka and Matononpa in 1880, the Yanktonai are divided into two sub- groups known as the Upper Yanktonai and the Lower Yanktonai (H\u00fa\u014bkpathina). They were involved in quarrying pipestone. The Yankton-Yanktonai moved into northern Minnesota. In the 18th century, they were recorded as living in the Mankato (Maka To \u2013 Earth Blue/Blue Earth) region of southwestern Minnesota along the Blue Earth River. Most of the Yankton live on the Yankton Indian Reservation in southeastern South Dakota. Some Yankton live on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation and Crow Creek Reservation, which is also occupied by the Lower Yanktonai. The Upper Yanktonai live in the northern part of Standing Rock Reservation, on the Spirit Lake Reservation in central North Dakota. Others live in the eastern half of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana. In addition, they reside at several Canadian reserves, including Birdtail, Oak Lake, and Whitecap (formerly Moose Woods). ==Modern geographic divisions== The Dakota maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations and communities in North America: in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Montana in the United States; and in Manitoba, southern Saskatchewan in Canada. The earliest known European record of the Dakota identified them in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. After the introduction of the horse in the early 18th century, the Sioux dominated larger areas of land\u2014from present day Central Canada to the Platte River, from Minnesota to the Yellowstone River, including the Powder River country. ===Modern reservations, reserves, and communities of the Sioux=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with the Lakota language, and both are also more distantly related to the Stoney and Assiniboine languages.
