    "text": "Topology of a bus network A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus. ==Function== A host on a bus network is called a station. In a bus network, every station will receive all network traffic, and the traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority. A bus network forms a single network segment and collision domain. In order for nodes to share the bus, they use a medium access control technology such as carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) or a bus master. ==Advantages and disadvantages== === Advantages === *Very easy to connect a computer or peripheral to a linear bus. *Requires less cable length than a star network resulting in lower costs. *The linear architecture is very simple and reliable. *It works well for small networks. *It is easy to extend by joining cable with connector or repeater. ===Disadvantages=== *Collisions occur in the network resulting in packet loss. *Bandwidth is shared among nodes; Performance may degrade with many nodes on the network. *It is difficult to isolate faults in the network. *The entire network shuts down or is divided into two separate networks if there is a break in the main cable. *If any link or segment of the bus is severed, depending on how the system has been designed, all network transmission may fail due to signal reflection caused by the lack of electrical termination. ==References== Category:Network architecture Category:Network topology ",
