    "text": "Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska, on the Alaska Peninsula. == Geography == Dutton lies just short of from King Cove, a fishing headquarters for the locality. == Geologic activity == Map showing volcanoes of Alaska Peninsula. Dutton is a highly glaciated volcano. Its summit is composed of a series of lava domes which form a complex stratovolcano. The mountain's recent history is marked by at least avalanche which removed andesitic lava flows and several lava domes from the flank of its body and swiftly cascaded westward and southward towards Belkofski Bay. Between 1984 and 1985, a series of earthquake swarms took place in the volcano's vicinity. Another swarm took place in the summer of 1988. ==See also== *List of volcanoes in the United States == References == ==Sources== * Volcanoes of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands-Selected Photographs * Alaska Volcano Observatory Category:Volcanoes of Aleutians East Borough, Alaska Category:Stratovolcanoes of the United States Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Volcanoes of Alaska Category:Aleutian Range Category:Mountains of Aleutians East Borough, Alaska Category:Subglacial volcanoes of Alaska ",
