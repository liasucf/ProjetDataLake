The forewings are dark fuscous purple with ochreous-yellow markings. There is a fine costal streak, dilated towards the base and a streak in the disc from near the base to the middle. A large oblique triangular blotch is found on the middle of the costa, the apex directed towards the tornus and reaching two- thirds of the way across the wing. There is also an elongate mark along the dorsum from one-third to three-fourths and a narrow fascia around the apical fourth of the costa and termen to the tornus, broadest at the apex. The hindwings have a subdorsal groove. They are dark fuscous, lighter towards the base and dorsum.Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. 1906 (2): 194. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1906 Category:Immidae Category:Moths of New Guinea ",
