Davenport brothers Ira Erastus Davenport (September 17, 1839 \u2013 July 8, 1911) and William Henry Davenport (February 1, 1841 \u2013 July 1, 1877), known as the Davenport brothers, were American magicians in the late 19th century, sons of a Buffalo, New York policeman. The brothers presented illusions that they and others claimed to be supernatural. ==Career== The Davenports began in 1854, less than a decade after Spiritualism had taken off in America. After stories of the Fox sisters, the Davenports started reporting similar occurrences. Their father took up managing his sons and the group was joined by William Fay, a Buffalo resident with an interest in conjuring. Their shows were introduced by a former \"Restoration Movement\" minister, Dr. J. B. Ferguson, a follower of Spiritualism, who assured the audience that the brothers worked by spirit power rather than deceptive trickery. Ferguson was apparently sincere in his belief that the Davenports possessed spiritual powers. The Davenports' most famous effect was the box illusion. The brothers were tied inside a box which contained musical instruments. Once the box was closed, the instruments would sound. Upon opening the box, the brothers were tied in the positions in which they had started the illusion. Those who witnessed the effect were made to believe supernatural forces had caused the trick to work. The Davenports toured the United States for 10 years and then traveled to England where spiritualism was beginning to become popular. Their \"spirit cabinet\" was investigated by the Ghost Club, who were challenging their claim of being able to contact the dead. The result of the Ghost Club's investigation was never made public. In 1868 the team was joined by Harry Kellar. Kellar and Fay eventually would leave the group to pursue their own career as a magician team. ==Exposures== The Davenport brothers were exposed as frauds many times.Christopher, Milbourne. (1990 edition, originally published in 1962). Magic: A Picture History. Dover Publications. p. 99. \"The Davenports were exposed many times, not only by magicians but by scientists and college students. The latter ignited matches in the dark. The flickering flames disclosed the brothers, with their arms free, waving the instruments which until then had seemed to be floating. The exposures had little effect on that segment of the public which chose to believe the manifestations were genuine. They closed their minds to the truth and sat in awe, sure that spirits had been conjured up in their presence.\" The stage magician John Nevil Maskelyne saw how the Davenports' spirit cabinet illusion worked, and stated to the audience in the theatre that he could recreate their act using no supernatural methods. With the help of a friend, cabinet maker George Alfred Cooke, he built a version of the cabinet. Together, they revealed the Davenport Brothers' trickery to the public at a show in Cheltenham in June 1865. Magicians including John Henry Anderson and Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin worked to expose the Davenport Brothers, writing expos\u00e9s and performing duplicate effects. A pair of amateur magicians followed the brothers around Britain, tying the Davenports into their box with a knot that could not be easily removed and thus exposed the trick to audiences who demanded their money back. The impresario P. T. Barnum included an expos\u00e9 of the Davenports in his 1865 book The Humbugs of the World. Davenport brothers cabinet. The Davenports were rejoined by William Fay for a final American tour before William Henry's death in 1877. Fay settled in Australia and Ira Erastus lived in America until the two reunited in 1895 and toured with a show that failed. The magician John Mulholland also exposed the tricks of the Davenport brothers: > A number of things immediately become less miraculous when it is known at > times the Davenports employed as many as ten confederates. It was a night > when a confederate was used that Alexander Herrmann (the stage magician > known as Herrmann the Great) described in an article in the Cosmopolitan > Magazine. The performance was being given in Ithaca, New York, and many > Cornell College students were in the audience. They had brought \"pyrotechnic > balls so made as to ignite suddenly with bright light.\" When the lights were > struck the Davenports were found to be on opposite sides of the stage waving > musical instruments around in the air.Mulholland, John . (1938). Beware > Familiar Spirits. Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 78. According to the magician Harry Houdini, Ira had confessed to him that he and his brother had faked their \"spirit\" phenomena. Houdini in his book A Magician Amongst the Spirits (1924) also reproduced a letter from Ira claiming \"we never in public affirmed our Belief in spiritualism.\" The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle refused to accept the exposures of fraud, and insisted that in private Ira was a practicing spiritualist.Nickell, Joe. (2001). Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 18-27. In 1998, skeptical investigator Joe Nickell discovered the Davenports' scrapbook from the museum at the Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly. Nickell examined newspaper clippings, personal notes and photographs from the scrapbook. He concluded that Doyle was correct about Ira endorsing spiritualism in private and Houdini was also correct about their public \"spirit\" phenomena being the result of trickery. According to Nickell \"taken as a whole, the evidence of the scrapbook does indicate that Ira Davenport was a practicing spiritualist, or at least pretended to be, although he and his brother used trickery to accomplish the effects they attributed to spirits.\" ==See also== *Thomas brothers ==References== ==Further reading== *Nichols, Thomas Low.
