    "text": "The archipelago of Cape Verde has been struck by a series of drought-related famines between the 1580s and the 1950s. During these periods of drought and famine, tens of thousands of inhabitants died from starvation and diseases. ==Background== The Cape Verde islands have a generally hot semi-arid climate, with substantial rainfall limited to the summer months August and September. The driest areas are the low eastern islands (Maio, Sal and Boa Vista), and the southwestern parts of the more mountainous islands. The higher and northeastern, windward parts receive more precipitation. Agriculture strongly depends on the summer rains; in years with less rain, crop failure was common. The situation was further aggravated by unsuitable crop choice, overpopulation, overgrazing, soil erosion and inadequate response from the Portuguese colonial administration. ==Historical famines== The following famines have been recorded: *1580-83, on Santiago, Maio and Brava *1609-11, on Santiago, combined with an epidemy of smallpoxCape Verde History Timeline, WorldAtlas *1685-90, around 4,000 deaths on Santiago *1704-12, on Santiago, Maio, Boa Vista, and Sal *1719-23, on Santiago, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Maio, Sal, Boa Vista, and Fogo. The latter three islands were depopulated *1738-40, on S\u00e3o Nicolau *1747-50, on all islands *1773-75, over 20,000 deaths on all islands *1830-33, around 30,000 deaths on all islands *1854-56, 25% of the population died *1863-66, between 20,000 and 30,000 deaths on all islands ==Famines in the 1940s== Two of Cape Verde's worst-ever famines occurred in 1941-43 and 1947-48, killing an estimated 45,000 people. The hardest hit were the islands of S\u00e3o Nicolau and Fogo, where resp. 28% and 31% of the population was killed. In 1946-48, Santiago lost 65% of its population. Several thousands of islanders emigrated, for instance accepting contract labour on the cocoa plantations of Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Between 1900 and 1970, about 80,000 Cape Verdeans were shipped to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. The Estado Novo government of Portugal showed little interest in its African colony, and failed to take measures to improve access to fresh water, or supply food aid. ==In popular culture== Fome 47 (\"Famine of 47\"), one of the best known songs by Cape Verdean musician Cod\u00e9 di Dona, relates the drought, famine and emigration to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in 1947. The third and final part of the novel Chiquinho by Baltasar Lopes da Silva is focused on the calamity of drought, a major problem in Cape Verde, which results in famine and many deaths. ==See also== *History of Cape Verde ==References== Category:History of Cape Verde Cape Verde Category:Natural disasters in Cape Verde Category:Cape Verdean American history Category:Cape Verdean diaspora ",
