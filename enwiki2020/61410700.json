    "text": "United States v. Winn, 79 F.Supp.3d 904 (2015), was a case in which the United States District Court, S.D. Illinois held that a search warrant was overbroad in that it allowed the police to search \"any or all files\" on a cell phone in an investigation of misdemeanor public indecency. The court held that the warrant was plainly overbroad because the police did not have probable cause to believe that everything on the phone was evidence related to the crime of public indecency. ==References== Category:2015 in United States case law Category:United States privacy case law Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law ",
