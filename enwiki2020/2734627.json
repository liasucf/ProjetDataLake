He elected to kick, rather than receive. As it turned out, the Lions never got the ball; on the Bears' opening drive, Chicago scored a field goal to win the game.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-25/sports/0211250170_1_marty- mornhinweg-lions-sideline-bears In 2003, he joined the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Eagles.
