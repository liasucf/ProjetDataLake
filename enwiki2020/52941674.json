    "text": "I Dream in Another Language () is a 2017 Mexican drama film directed by Ernesto Contreras. It was screened in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition section of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Its premise is about a dying indigenous language that the main character is eager to save, only to arrive and discover that the last two speakers refuse to speak to each other because of a longstanding grudge. This closely resembles a headline published in 2011 by The Guardian that reported a dying language in Mexico known as Ayapa Zoque that was doomed because the last two speakers had a grudge and wouldn't speak to each other. This story, though untrue, was reprinted globally in publications including Sydney Morning Herald and Time Magazine. ==Cast== * Fernando \u00c1lvarez Rebeil as Mart\u00edn * Jos\u00e9 Manuel Poncelis as Isauro * Eligio Mel\u00e9ndez as Evaristo * F\u00e1tima Molina as Lluvia * Norma Ang\u00e9lica as Flaviana ==Reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80%, based on 15 reviews, and an average rating of 7.02/10. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:2017 drama films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican drama films Category:Spanish- language films Category:Films about language and translation Category:Mexican LGBT-related films Category:2017 LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films ",
