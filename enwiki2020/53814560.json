    "text": "Sprucedale is a populated place situated in Greenlee County, Arizona. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. The location was originally called Espero, for the Spanish word for \"hope\", and was founded by Hiram and Maryette Thompson, who homesteaded the area after moving from Springerville, Arizona. A U.S. Post Office named Espero existed at the location from 1919 through 1934. The property was purchased in 1921 by E.H. Patterson, and his wife Bertha, who turned the location into guest ranch. At some point between 1934 and 1941 the name was changed to Sprucedale. The Pattersons sold the property in 1941 for the sum of $10,000 to Walter and Faye Wiltbank. In 2011, the area was threatened by the Wallow Fire, which burned of land in Arizona and New Mexico. ==References== Category:Populated places in Greenlee County, Arizona ",
