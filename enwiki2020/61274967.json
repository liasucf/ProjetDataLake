    "text": "{| |} Romance of the Sea was a clipper ship launched in 1853. She was \"the last extreme clipper ship built by Donald McKay for the California trade\". Her original figurehead was \"a small female figure, intended to represent Romance, with the name of [Sir Walter] Scott on one side, and [James Fennimore] Cooper on the other - the greatest romancers of the century\". She lost that figurehead during a storm on her third voyage. In her nine year life, Romance of the Sea made six round-trip voyages from North Atlantic ports before being lost during her seventh voyage. ==Her voyages== The Romance of the Sea's voyages are listed here.
