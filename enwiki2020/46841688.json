    "text": "Palakkattu Madhavan (aka Palakkad Madhavan) is a 2015 Tamil comedy-drama film written and directed by M Chandramohan and produced by TCM. The film stars Vivek and Sonia Agarwal in the lead roles, while Sheela essays a supporting role. ==Plot== Palakattu Madhavan (Vivek) is a lazy, irresponsible man. Embarrassed that his wife Lakshmi (Sonia Agarwal) earns more than him, he quits his job out of spite. He then adopts the old woman Pattu Maami (Sheela) as a surrogate mother because she offers to pay cash for the opportunity. The character \"Palakkattu Madhavan\" is also an acknowledgement of a character with the same name in the movie Antha Ezhu Naatkal starring Bhagyaraj and Ambika. ==Cast== * Vivek as Palakattu Madhavan * Sonia Agarwal as Lakshmi * Sheela as Pattu Maami * Rajendran as U. Santosh Kumar * Aarthi as Kokilla Maami * Swaminathan as Vichu Maama * Cell Murugan as Chittukuruvi * Crane Manohar as Suppudu * Manobala as Madhavan's boss * Imman Annachi as MLM Company Manager * Karate Raja as Pattu Maami's son * Singamuthu as Lingusamy / \"Link\" Samy * T. P. Gajendran as Kuberan Travels Owner * Pandu as Minister's PA * Abhinayashree (special appearance) ==Production== The film began production in June 2014, with M Chandramohan opting to direct a film to be produced by TCM starring Vivek in the lead role. ==Reception== Sify gave the film four out of five stars, noting the film engages the audience due to the presence of actor Vivek in the lead role. Times of India generally praised the film but declared its writing somewhat weak and wrote \"[t]he entire first half is wasted with redundant scenes that try to tell us what a lazy person Madhavan is.\" A flaw was noted in writer/director M Chandramohan not developing his characters and letting them remain caricatures. Also, a lack of consistency in their behaviors prevented viewers from caring about them as much as was wished, and it was disliked that the director repeatedly had actor Vivek break the fourth wall for the sake of comedy. The film collected in Chennai on first day turning out to be a disappointment. The film collected in the Box Office. ==Soundtrack== Music is composed by Srikanth Deva. Anirudh Ravichander has sung \"Uchimela\" for which Vivek wrote the lyrics. # \"Uchimela\" \u2014 Anirudh Ravichander # \"Sandhoshame\" \u2014 Sriram Parthasarathy # \"Eppadi Irundhen\" \u2014 Gangai Amaran # \"Kunnan Pol\" \u2014 Surmukhi Raman ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2015 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian comedy films Category:Films scored by Srikanth Deva ",
