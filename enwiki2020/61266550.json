    "text": "Rafael Nadal won his 19th Grand Slam title and 4th US Open title, by defeating Daniil Medvedev, 7\u20135, 6\u20133, 5\u20137, 4\u20136, 6\u20134 to capture the Men's Singles tennis title at the 2019 US Open. Nadal's victory meant that every Grand Slam title since the beginning of 2017 had been won by either Rafael Nadal (5), Novak Djokovic (4) or Roger Federer (3). This was the first time since 2006\u201308 that Nadal, Djokovic and Federer had claimed all Grand Slam titles for 3 consecutive years. Novak Djokovic was the defending champion, but retired due to injury against Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round, after losing the first two sets. This was the first time since 2006 that Djokovic failed to reach the semifinals at the US Open (not counting the 2017 tournament, which he missed due to injury). The respective losses of Wawrinka and Federer in the quarterfinals guaranteed a first time Grand Slam finalist in the top half of the draw. Medvedev became the second Russian player (after Marat Safin) to reach a US Open men's singles final. Medvedev also became the first Russian man to reach a Grand Slam final since Safin at the 2005 Australian Open. Grigor Dimitrov (ranked 78th) became the lowest ranked men's singles semifinalist at the US Open since Jimmy Connors (ranked 174th) in 1991. Dimitrov was also the lowest ranked men's singles semifinalist at any Grand Slam tournament since Rainer Sch\u00fcttler (ranked 92nd) at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships. This was the first Grand Slam men's singles tournament since the 2012 US Open without at least two former Grand Slam champions in the semifinals. It was also the first time in the Open Era that 4 quarterfinalists (Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka and Ga\u00ebl Monfils) were 33 years old or older. By reaching the finals, Nadal also became the oldest player to reach all 4 Grand Slam semifinals and at least 3 Grand Slam finals in a calendar year in the Open Era. There were seven active Grand Slam champions and seven active US Open champions; five of the seven participated in the tournament (2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro and 2012 champion Andy Murray did not). It was also the last Grand Slam tournament for 2010 Wimbledon finalist, 2012 US Open semifinalist and former World No. 4 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and former World No. 8 and two-time US Open quarterfinalist Janko Tipsarevi\u0107. ==Seeds== ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==Championship match ratings== 2.751 million viewers on ESPN, in the USA. ==References== ==External links== *Main draw *2019 US Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Singles US Open \u2013 Men's Singles Category:US Open (tennis) by year \u2013 Men's Singles ",
