Historically, the ' have been considered a social category of assigned male at birth individuals who adopt the clothing, work, and mannerisms that Lakota culture usually considers feminine. In contemporary Lakota culture, ' is usually used to refer to a homosexual man, whether or not that man is in other ways gender non-conforming. They may or may not consider themselves part of the more mainstream gay, LGBT, or pan- Indian two-spirit communities. Historically, sometimes the direction to adopt the social and spiritual aspects of this role has come in a series of dreams.

In contemporary Lakota communities, attitudes toward the ' vary from accepting to homophobic. ==Etymology== Beatrice Medicine writes: > In my childhood, we were aware of this social category, which was referred > to as winkte.
