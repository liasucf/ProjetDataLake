    "text": "The 1982 NCAA Rifle Championships were contested at the third annual tournament to determine the team and individual national champions of NCAA co- ed collegiate rifle shooting in the United States. The championship was held at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia during March 1982. Tennessee Tech, with a team score of 6,138, once again won the team title; the Golden Eagles finished ahead of West Virginia, runners-up for the third consecutive year, with a score of 6,136. Tennessee Tech was coached by James Newkirk. Both individual champions were repeat winners from the previous year: Kurt Fitz-Randolph (Tennessee Tech) for smallbore rifle and John Rost (West Virginia) for air rifle. ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for rifle shooting, all NCAA rifle programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 9 teams ultimately contested this championship. ==Results== *Scoring: The championship consisted of 120 shots by each competitor in smallbore and 40 shots per competitor in air rifle. ===Team title=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !!
