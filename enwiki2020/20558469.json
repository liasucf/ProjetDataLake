The Piggott School is one of the best performing secondary schools in the Wokingham District. ==History== The Piggott School was founded by Robert Piggott, a philanthropist, to cater for 20 poor boys and 20 poor girls in separate schools. The foundation stone was laid on 12 October 1939 it was officially opened on 17 September 1940.http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/education/s/2058367_piggott_school_to_celebrate_70_years The school was originally built for 320 children. When was opened in 1940, it was already too small because war had broken out and a massive evacuation programme was underway (two million children were moved from London to the countryside within three days). This caused a doubling of the local population of children and far more pupils had to be accommodated by the school. Morning school was therefore organised for 'home' children. Afternoon school was for the 'visitors'. ==Recent and future changes== Since becoming an academy, there have been several changes to the new site. In 2011, a new sixth form block was opened to replace the old sixth form block (now used as a drama studio and extra classroom). A purpose built gym run by Nuffield Health was constructed on the site of the old Maths and Business Studies terrapins, which is open to the public on evenings and weekends. ( Nuffield no longer run the gym) ==Houses== Piggott School sweatshirt. Note: Pupil is in Thames house hence the colour. The four houses are: St Patricks Thames Kennet Loddon Loddon house is named after the River Loddon in Berkshire and Hampshire. The emblem is a Lion. Thames house is named after the River Thames which runs through several cities and towns, the emblem is a dragon. Kennet house is named after the River Kennet which runs through Reading, the emblem is a green dragon. St Patrick's house is named after St Patrick's Stream, a backwater of the Thames that flows into the Loddon, the emblem is a harp. The current school sweatshirt (since 2011) comes with the school house; the logo can either be red for Thames, blue for St Patricks, green for Kennet, and yellow for Loddon. The old school sweatshirt consisted of only a gold writing and no house badge underneath. There are many competitions between these four houses, including, rugby, football, netball, hockey, sports day, the governors cup and many more. ==Church Status== The Piggott School is a school with a Church Foundation. ==Ofsted== The school is very high achieving in the terms of results, OfSTED and SIAMS inspections.
