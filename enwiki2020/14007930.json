    "text": "\"Georgy Girl\" is a song by the Australian pop/folk music group the Seekers. It was used as the title song for the 1966 film of the same name. Tom Springfield, who had written \"I'll Never Find Another You\", composed the music and Jim Dale supplied the lyrics. The song is heard at both the beginning and end of the film, with markedly different lyrics (and with different lyrics again from those in the commercially released version). It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The song became a hit in late 1966 and early 1967, reaching number one in Australia and number three in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it was the Seekers' highest charting single, reaching number one on the Cash Box Top 100. \"Georgy Girl\" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100; \"I'm a Believer\" by The Monkees, kept the song from number one. The song's US success prompted the Seekers' British album Come the Day to be retitled Georgy Girl for its American release. ==Chart history== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1966\u201367) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- | |- |New Zealand (Listener)Flavour of New Zealand, 28 April 1967 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|10 |- |UK (The Official Charts Company) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1967) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|57 |- |US Cash Boxhttp://tropicalglen.com/Archives/60s_files/1967YESP.html Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 23, 1967 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |} ==Cover versions== In 1967, an instrumental version by the Baja Marimba Band reached number 98 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 14 on the easy listening chart.
