During her career, she was the first woman to serve as the Deputy Marshal of the Sejm, a post which she held from 1971 to 1985, the first architect to design independent housing for disabled persons, and designed some of the most sought-after housing developments of her day. ==Early life== Halina Erentz was born on 10 January 1921 in Warsaw, Poland, to Ewelina (n\u00e9e Kuczkowska) and Wactaw Erentz. During the war, Erentz worked in the resistance movement and was a member of the \u017begota Council to Aid Jews. Entering Warsaw University of Technology, she began working for Romuald Gutt, a prominent pre-war modernist architect during her schooling in 1946. She worked on designs for the Central Statistical Office building () under his tutelage before graduating in 1948. ==Career== Upon finishing her schooling, Erentz began working at the Warsaw Reconstruction Office (pl) and was assigned to the reconstruction team for the National Theatre. In 1951, Erentz married fellow architect . Zygmunt later would serve as the chair of the Society of Polish Urban Planners. The couple rarely worked together, as Skibniewska focused her work on residential architecture, hoping to address urban issues such as lack of amenities and proper sanitation, as well as overcrowding. In the 1960s, she worked on such projects as Winogrady (1963\u20131964) in Pozna\u0144 and Wolska IV (1965). One of Skibniewska's most known developments was at the Szwole\u017cer\u00f3w estate, in which she designed a sought-after housing project known as \u017boliborz Orchards (, 1958\u20131963). The reclamation project utilized ornamentation, brickwork and wood from derelict historic structures on the estate, as was typical of her work. In the economic conditions of the time, she found ways to economize without compromising the design or integrity of her structures, using an interdisciplinary approach to balance ecological, economic and social factors. Organizing five-story buildings around a central courtyard, which had formerly been a garden, Skibniewska's plan included an influential development of the site. Spaces between the buildings were designed as parks for residents and at the outskirts, she included a kindergarten, child care facility and a school. She continued to work on the project through 1973 and expanded it between 1974 and 1976 to include the Szwole\u017cer\u00f3w complex. Her commitment to socially responsible architecture includes a Warsaw housing project in the Sadyba neighborhood, Osiedle Sadyba (1972\u201375), which was the first independent living facility for the disabled. In the same neighborhood, she built a school (1971), a day care center and an educational center. In 1974, she completed the ZETO building in Warsaw, the Sok\u00f3\u0142ka Kindergarten in 1975 and between 1975 and 1986 she worked on a noted housing project in .

Re-elected numerous times, she served until 1985. During the 1981\u20131983 period of martial law, she was influential in assisting political prisoners and those interned under the verification program or facing court martial. At the same time, she joined the faculty of her alma mater in 1971, and from 1975 to 1985, served as a lecturer in the Faculty of Architecture ().
