Shaken by the changes brought on by the Second Vatican Council, he founded the abbey as a way to continue the traditional practice and life of the Benedictine Monks and the traditional liturgy of the Catholic Church. In 1979 a female branch was founded, the . In 1986 the community numbered 53 monks. Initially supportive of the Lefebvrist movement, they made a break with it in the aftermath of the \u00c9c\u00f4ne consecrations and the subsequent excommunications of archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the consecrated bishops. On July 25, 1988 after a period of negotiations the monks were relieved of their sanctions and reconciled with the Holy See, while still being authorized to use the pre-concillar liturgy in accordance with the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei issued by Pope John Paul II the day after the excommunications. On June 18, 1989 the monastery was accorded canonical status and on July 2 it was elevated to the rank of Abbey, with Dom Gerard Calvet as its first Abbot. The Abbey was consecrated on October 2, 1989 by Cardinal \u00c9douard Gagnon. On September 24, 1995, Cardinal Ratzinger, then prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, visited the monastery and celebrated Mass. On November 21, 2002 eight of the almost 70 monks left the Abbey to found the in Saint-Pierre-de-Clairac. Dom Gerard resigned as Abbot on November 25, 2003 and Dom Louis-Marie was chosen to replace him. On February 28, 2008 Dom Gerard died due to brain stroke. On September 25, 2008, the Abbey became part of the Benedictine Confederation of the Order of St Benedict. In 2008 several monks left Le Barroux to make a new foundation in Villatalla, Imperia Province, Italy.
