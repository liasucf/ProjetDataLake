    "text": "The 2017\u201318 Khuzestan Premier League season was the 18th season of the Khuzestan Premier League which took place from September 6, 2017 to March 14, 2018 with 16 teams competing from the province of Khuzestan. This was the first year that the league increased its teams from 14 to 16. Teams played home and away with one another each playing 30 matches. Esteghlal Novin Mahshahr finished the season on top of the standings and was promoted to division 3 of the Iranian football system. Meanwhile, finishing in last place, Shahbaz Shadegan will be relegated to the Khuzestan Division 1 league. ==League changes== With 5 teams being relegated down from Division 3, the Khuzestan Football Association announced that the league will be expanded from 14 to 16 teams in an effort to accommodate the relegated teams. Since only 1 team is promoted every year to Division 3, the 5 relegated teams would have created an unbalanced league under the 14 team system. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Team !Location !Stadium !Capacity |- |Esteghlal Novin Mahshahr |Mahshahr |Mahshahr Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Persepolis Novin Dezful |Mianrud |Mianrud Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Jonub Susangerd |Susangerd |Susangerd Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Persepolis Shush |Shush |Takhti Shush Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Shahrdari Bandar-e Emam |Bandar-e Emam |Takhti Bandar-e Emam Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Iranmehr Khoramshahr |Khoramshahr |Shahrdari Khoramshahr Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Shahin Shahr-e Emam |Dezful |Mehrvali Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Persepolis Veys |Veys |Veys Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Abi Pooshan Hamidieh |Hamidiyeh |Hamidieh Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Anzan Novin Izeh |Izeh |Takhti Izeh Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Bahmaei Ramhormoz |Ramhormoz |Takhti Ramhormoz Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Omid Andishe Shushtar |Shushtar |Takhti Shushtar Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |Rakhsh Arvand Abadan |Abadan |Shahrdari Abadan Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Esteghlal Veys |Veys |Veys Martyrs Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Esteghlal Masjedsoleiman |Masjed Soleiman |Naftun Masjed Soleiman Arena |style=\"text- align:center\" | 5,000 |- |Shahbaz Shadegan |Shadegan |Takhti Shadegan Arena |style=\"text-align:center\" | 10,000 |- |} == Final Standings == ==Results== == See also == * 2017\u201318 Azadegan League * 2017\u201318 League 2 * 2017\u201318 League 3 * 2017\u201318 Hazfi Cup * 2017 Iranian Super Cup == References == Category:Khuzestan Premier League 1 Iran ",
