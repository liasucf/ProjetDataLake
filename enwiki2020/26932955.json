Bingham PrizePEN American Center Names Award Winners, among other honors.

Both retrieved 26 March 2012. ==Life and career== Paul Harding grew up on the north shore of Boston in the town of Wenham, Massachusetts. As a youth he spent a lot of time \"knocking about in the woods,\" which he attributes to his love of nature.Paul Harding\u2019s Magical \u2018Tinkers\u2019, audio interview with Christopher Lydon, May 7th, 2009. His grandfather fixed clocks and he apprenticed under him, an experience that found its way into his novel Tinkers. Harding has a B.A. in English from the University of Massachusetts AmherstThe Literary Horologist: Paul Harding \u201cTinkers\u201d With Time , OpenLoopPress interview and an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop and has taught writing at Harvard University and the University of Iowa. After graduating from the University of Massachusetts, he spent time touring with his band Cold Water Flat in the US and Europe. He had always been a heavy reader and recalls reading Carlos Fuentes' Terra Nostra and thinking \"this is what I want to do\". In that book Harding \"saw the entire world, all of history\". When he next had time off from touring with the band he signed up for a summer writing class at Skidmore College in New York. His teacher was Marilynne Robinson and through her he learned about the Iowa Writers' Workshop writing program. There he studied with Barry Unsworth, Elizabeth McCracken and later Robinson. At some point he realized some of the people he admired most were \"profoundly religious\" and so he spent years reading theology, and was \"deeply\" influenced by Karl Barth and John Calvin. He considers himself a \"self-taught modern New England transcendentalist\". Harding's second novel, Enon (2013), concerns characters from his first novel, Tinkers, looking at the lives of George Crosby's grandson, Charlie Crosby, and his daughter Kate. Musically, he admires jazz drummers and considers John Coltrane's drummer, Elvin Jones, the greatest. Harding lives near Boston with his wife and two sons.\"2010 Pulitzer Prizes\".
