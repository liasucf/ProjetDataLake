    "text": "Professor Peter Engels is a physicist at Washington State University who conducts research in the field of ultracold atomic gases. His group at WSU performs a variety of experiments involving quantum hydrodynamics, spin-orbit coupling (See Spin-orbit interaction), soliton formation, condensed matter physics, and more using Rb-87 (bosonic) and K-40 (fermionic). Recently, in collaboration with the theorists Prof. Michael Forbes, Yongping Zhang, and Thomas Busch, his team published research demonstrating negative mass hydrodynamics in a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Washington State University faculty ",
