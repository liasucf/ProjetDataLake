Companion to Baroque Music Julie Anne Sadie - 1998 0520214145 p47 Pagliardi worked primarily in Florence, where he served as maestro di cappella (succeeding Cesti) to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, at the church of S Lorenzo and, in his last years, at the cathedral. His oratorio L'innocenza trionfante was performed in Genoa at Ss Annunziata in 1660, and several collections of motets were published in Rome during the mid 1670s. But it was not until 1672 that he produced his first (and most popular) opera, Caligula delirante (text by Gioberti), at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, followed by Lisimaco (text by Ivanovich) the next year. ... He became de facto maestro di cappella at Florence Cathedral from 1690, but did not formally gain the title till the death of his predecessor, Pietro Sammartini. ==Works== *L'innocenza trionfante, oratorio performed at Ss Annunziata, Genoa in 1660 *Il Caligola delirante, 3-act opera at Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo in Venice; Giovanni Maria Pagliardi, libretto Domenico Gisberti - 1672 VeniceA New Chronology of Venetian Opera and Related Genres, 1660-1760, restaged 1680 *Lisimaco, text by Ivanovich 1673 *Numa Pompilio 1674, Venice *Lo speziale di villa, Florence - probably not originally by Pagliardi Emilio de' Cavalieri \"gentiluomo romano\" Warren Kirkendale - 2001 \"1681 Granprincipe Ferdinando paid Pagliardi \"per le spese fatte col viaggio di lui da Genova a Firenze\", as well as his ...
