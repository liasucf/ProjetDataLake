    "text": "Penelope () is a Slovak psychological drama film directed by \u0160tefan Uher. Starring Bo\u017eidara Turzonovov\u00e1 and Eva Krist\u00ednov\u00e1, the movie was released on January 20, 1978. Similarly as with some of previous works directed by Uher, such as Slnko v sieti (1962), he reunited with screenwriter Alfonz Bedn\u00e1r and cinematographer Stanislav Szomol\u00e1nyi. ==Plot== Restorer Eva Kamenick\u00e1 (Bo\u017eidara Turzonovov\u00e1) arrives to the village to repair frescoes of the heroines of ancient myths for the local castle. In daily life of the village inhabitants Eva soon finds some elements of ancient tragedy, especially in fate of a lonely old lady named Malovcov\u00e1 (Eva Krist\u00ednov\u00e1). The woman, commonly referred to by locals as \"Waitress of Change\", awaits the return of her husband and son, who had gone to work in America twenty years ago. Eva sees in her a picture of the devoted and patient \"Penelope\", whose courage and faith impress young restorer. Experience gained while staying in the country turns into her own life decision. Not long after she becomes close with the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Viktor (Michal Do\u010dolomansk\u00fd), she decides to leave her daughter Mima (Jana \u010celigov\u00e1) with selfish husband and start a new life. ==Cast== * Bo\u017eidara Turzonovov\u00e1 - Eva Kamenick\u00e1, restorer * Eva Krist\u00ednov\u00e1 - Mrs. Malovcov\u00e1, \"Waitress of Change\"/\"Penelopa\" * Gust\u00e1v Valach - Kuzma, Sr. * Michal Do\u010dolomansk\u00fd - Viktor Kuzma, Secretary of the Municipal Committee * Ilja Pracha\u0159 - Mi\u0161o Bajzl\u00edk * Du\u0161an Bla\u0161kovi\u010d - Vertel * Milan Ki\u0161 - Grac\u00edk * Anton \u0160ul\u00edk - Lov\u010dan * Leopold Haverl - Stanko * Jaroslav Vrzala - Nemlaha * Igor \u010cill\u00edk - Ondro * Ji\u0159ina Jelensk\u00e1 - Zora/Zuza * Jana Nagyov\u00e1 - Verona * Michal Nesvadba - Fero ;Uncredited * Igor Hrabinsk\u00fd - Miro * Jana \u010celigov\u00e1 - Mima, Eva's daughter * Elena Volkov\u00e1 - Mrs. Kuzmov\u00e1 * \u0160tefan Mi\u0161ovic - Bla\u017eej * J\u00e1n G\u00e9c - publican * Jozef Mifkovi\u010d - publican * Em\u00edlia Halamov\u00e1 - Amerik\u00e1n's wife * Vladim\u00edr Macko - plice officer * \u013dubom\u00edr Za\u0165ovi\u010d - Mol\u010dan * Franti\u0161ek Desset - Berto Bajz\u00edk * Lenka Ko\u0159\u00ednkov\u00e1 - girl * \u0160tefan Tur\u0148a * Jaroslav \u010cern\u00edk * \u013dudov\u00edt Gre\u0161\u0161o - Mi\u0161o Bajz\u00edk * Hana Kostolansk\u00e1 - Kuzmov\u00e1 * Du\u0161an Kapr\u00e1lik - Fero * Katar\u00edna Orb\u00e1nov\u00e1 - Zuza ==Awards == {| class=wikitable !
