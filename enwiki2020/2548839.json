The locals formed a posse to track the Paiutes as they headed west toward what is now Monticello, Utah and then north toward the La Sal Mountains. As the Paiutes moved north, the posse broke into two parts, a small group to follow them and the greater number to take a route around them and meet them from the front. A running battle between the Indians and the smaller posse seemed to indicate the plan was working as the Paiutes kept ahead of them. Unexpectedly, the Paiutes took up an ideal position for an ambush on Wilson Mesa, near Pinhook Draw, at the northeastern end of the La Sal Mountains. When the smaller posse arrived, the Paiutes, estimated at 80-100, massacred cowboys, with only one escaping, Harg Eskridge. *Beaver Creek Massacre (June 19, 1885) - Cases of cattle-rustling by the Utes on white cattlemen caused tensions that eventually led to a skirmish between the two parties in Beaver Creek. In the gunfight that ensued, cowboys killed six Mountain Ute Indians. It was the last major confrontation between Ute Indians and white settlers in Colorado.Beaver Creek Massacre *Ute War (1887) *Bluff War (1914-1915) *Bluff Skirmish (1921) *Posey War (1923) ==See also== *Battle Creek Massacre *Sioux Wars *Apache Wars *Navajo Wars *Comanche Wars ==References== ==Bibliography== * Ute Ute Ute Ute Ute Category:Mormonism and Native Americans ",
