    "text": "The Minister for the Union is a position created by Boris Johnson during his first ministry, to be held concurrently with his duties as Prime Minister.Minister for the Union is distinct from the office of PM; it is listed separately from Prime Minister and its ex officio titles of First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service. See: Johnson proposed the position during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership campaign. The office is intended to emphasise Johnson's commitment to strengthening the bond between the countries of the United Kingdom. He is the first Prime Minister to adopt the title. In July 2019 the title was described as a \"cynical rebranding\" by Kirsty Blackman, deputy leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons from 2017-2020, who advocates Scottish independence. On 4 September 2019, the Government announced \u00a310 million in funding to support the Prime Minister's work as Minister for the Union. The post has been retained by Johnson in his second ministry. During the COVID-19 pandemic in July 2020 Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales and leader of Welsh Labour, drew attention to Johnson's lack of contact with the Welsh Government, saying \"If you are minister for the union, speaking to the component parts of the union seems to me a sensible way of discharging those responsibilities.\" ==Responsibilities== In July 2020, one year after its creation, the gov.uk website continued to show no responsibilities associated with this position. At the beginning of September 2020, responsibilities were listed as follows: \"As Minister for the Union, the Prime Minister works to ensure that all of government is acting on behalf of the entire United Kingdom: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.\" ==List of Ministers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
