Stephen Decatur captured her in June 1815 at the Battle off Cape Gata. This created a favorable American position from which to bargain with the Dey of Algiers.US Naval Institute; Commodore Stephen Decatur and the War on Algiers Lloyd's List reported that the Algerine frigate Mezoura, which had been under the command of the Algerine admiral, had arrived at Carthagena on 20 June 1815 as a prize to Decatur's squadron. The newspaper also reported that Decatur's squadron had run another Spanish frigate onshore near Carthagena.Lloyd's List, no.4987, - accessed 16 May 2014. The Spanish government interned Mashouda and returned her to Algiers at the end of the war.
