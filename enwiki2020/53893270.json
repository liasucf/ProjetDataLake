Located at Broad and Ninth Streets (the latter now Martin Luther King Blvd), the station was one of two major railroad terminals in the city, the other being the Southern Railway's Terminal Station. Modifications were added in 1868 and 1881 to include offices and waiting rooms. The train car shed was in use during and after the Civil War. After failed efforts to preserve the structure, the Union Depot was torn down in 1972. == History == The Union Depot was constructed of limestone and brick; the bricks used were made by slaves. The center line of the train car shed was the boundary line between the Western & Atlantic Railway and the Nashville & Chattanooga Railway. During the Civil War, the train car shed was used as an army hospital. A head house was added in 1882, and the south end was demolished and replaced with butterfly sheds in 1926. In 1900, Georgian marble floors were added to the building, which was appropriate because Georgia owned the land that the Union Depot stood on. Throughout the first four decades of the facility's operation, its ownership had been disputed between the state of Georgia (and by extension, the Western & Atlantic Railway and successors), the East Tennessee & Georgia Railroad, and the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, the latter two having leased portions of the property. The case was settled in the 1890s, when the courts ultimately ruled in favor of Georgia, and determined that the Western & Atlantic Railway and the Nashville & Chattanooga Railway were the rightful owners, the other two roads only having \"vested rights\" to its usage.Govan, Gilbert E. \u201cThe Chattanooga Union Station.\u201d Tennessee Historical Quarterly, vol. 29, no. 4, 1970, pp. 372\u2013378. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42623184 The debate over ownership resulted in the organization of the Chattanooga Station Company in 1905. The company was formed by the three lines of the Southern Railway System (which had absorbed the East Tennessee & Georgia) and the Central of Georgia Railway. In 1901, the Western and Atlantic's General locomotive was placed on display in the station. It remained displayed until 1961, when Western & Atlantic's successor, the Louisville and Nashville removed the engine to be restored to operating condition. The engine then toured various parts of the eastern United States until 1967, when despite efforts by Chattanooga's then mayor Ralph Kelley to keep the engine in the city, the engine was ultimately given to the state of Georgia, who placed it on display in the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, where it currently remains.http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2016/dec/11/elliott- sam-d-elliott/402072/ The last passenger train was the Louisville & Nashville's St. Louis and Chicago to Atlanta Georgian.

The plan proposed restoration and utilization as the center of a midtown mall. The class presented a paper and a video to the Chattanooga City Commission on July 19, 1971. Mayor Robert Kirk Walker recommended that the students take their presentation to the Downtown Development Committee. The Chattanooga Area Historical Association joined the fight to save the Union Depot in November 1971. However, on September 26, 1971, Georgia decided to sell some of the land it owned, including the depot site. The structure was torn down the following year, and the site currently houses office buildings. A historical marker was placed at the location of the Union Depot.The Union Depot, 2B 25, Tennessee Historical Commission, Chattanooga, TN. While the group was unsuccessful in saving the station, their efforts did manage to save Terminal Station from a similar fate. ==References== Chattanooga Category:Demolished railway stations in the United States Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures in Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:Railway stations in Tennessee Chattanooga Category:Transportation in Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:Railway stations closed in 1971 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1859 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1972 ",
