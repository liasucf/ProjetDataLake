    "text": "The Stone Bridge is a 1637 landscape painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt in the collection of the Rijksmuseum. ==Painting == This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1915, who wrote: The picture is currently documented as being in the collection of Augustin Lapeyri\u00e8re, based presumably on the Hofstede de Groot catalog. Before him, Smith wrote: Probably M. Perrier refers to Augustin Lapeyri\u00e8re, because it was sold on 14 April 1817, lot nr. 46, in Paris. The auction catalogue of May 12, 1900 stated that it was in the collection of James Gray of Versailles in 1863, which Hofstede de Groot repeated. Since Waagen had seen the painting in the collection of the Marquess of Landsdowne in 1850, this was however impossible.Landscape with a stone bridge in the RKD ==See also== *List of paintings by Rembrandt ==References== ==Sources== *Landscape with a stone bridge in the Rembrandt database Category:Paintings by Rembrandt Category:1630s paintings category:Paintings of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Category:Bridges in art ",
