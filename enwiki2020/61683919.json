    "text": "Free Beer and Chicken is a live album by blues musician John Lee Hooker recorded in California in 1974 and released by the ABC label the same year. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne stated: \"In some ways this is a typical John Lee Hooker album; in other ways it is totally unlike any other he did. Being interesting can be a curse, however, as the music itself just isn't that inspired. Of course... Free Beer and Chicken has the sound of a collection of tracks that were salvaged from some ambitious but never finished project involving dozens of guests. That's one thing that is typical, or at least would become typical in the last, most high-profile decade of Hooker's career... Free Beer and Chicken gets a low rating due to the presence of all the talent mentioned, as well as the genius of Hooker: With all that going for it, this should have been a much better album\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"Make It Funky\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Five Long Years\" (Eddie Boyd) \u2013 5:59 # \"713 Blues\" \u2013 4:39 # \"714 Blues\" \u2013 2:59 # \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" \u2013 3:29 # \"Homework\" \u2013 4:26 # \"Bluebird\" 4:52 # \"Settin' on Top of the World\" \u2013 3:27 # \"(You'll Never Amount to Anything If You Don't Go to) Collage (A Fortuitous Concatenation of Events)\" \u2013 5:52 ## \"I Know How to Rock\" ## \"Nothin' But the Best\" ## \"The Scratch\" (Joe Cocker) ## \"Sally Mae\" ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Greg Adams \u2013 trumpet (tracks 1, 7 & 9) *Mic Gillette \u2013 trumpet, trombone (tracks 1, 7 & 9) *Sam Rivers \u2013 flute (track 2) *Emilio Castillo (tracks 1, 7 & 9), Lenny Pickett (tracks 1 & 7) \u2013 tenor saxophone *Steve Kupka \u2013 baritone saxophone (tracks 1, 7 & 9) *Jim Caroompas (track 9), Charlie Grimes (tracks 1 & 9), Hollywood Fats (tracks 3-5, 7 & 8), Jim Kahr (tracks 2 & 7), Jim Thorsen (track 9), Howard Roberts (tracks 3, 4 & 6), Luther Tucker (track 9), Wa-Wa Watson (tracks 1, 2 & 9), \u2013 guitar *Clifford Coulter \u2013 piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Hohner clavinet, Fender bass, Moog bass, Moog synthesizer, ARP synthesizer *Robert Hooker \u2013 piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Hammond organ (tracks 1 & 9) *Skip Olson \u2013 Fender bass, bass (tracks 3, 4 & 9) *Ron Beck (tracks 2-6), Ken Swank (tracks 1, 3, 4, 7 & 9) \u2013 drums *Kenneth Nash \u2013 balophon, congas, Griot bells, Chinese hand cymbals, Ganquok bell, shaker (tracks 1 & 8), kalimba (track 8) *Joe Cocker \u2013 vocals, tambourine (tracks 2, 5 & 9) *Sugarcane Harris (tracks 3 & 4), Michael White (tracks 8 & 9) \u2013 violin *Peter Berg \u2013 coconut banjo (track 8) *Fatz Wess \u2013 tom tom, Moog synthesizer (track 8) *Boyd Albritton \u2013 slide guitar (track 9) ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:1974 live albums Category:ABC Records albums ",
