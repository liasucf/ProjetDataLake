Hypogea will often contain niches for cremated human remains or loculi for buried remains. Occasionally tombs of this type are referred to as built tombs. The term hypogeum can also refer to any antique building or part of building built below ground such as the series of tunnels under the Colosseum which held slaves (particularly enemy captives) and animals while keeping them ready to fight in the gladiatorial games. The animals and slaves could be let up through trapdoors under the sand-covered arena at any time during a fight. ==Examples== An early example of a hypogeum is found at the Minoan Bronze Age site of Knossos on Crete. Hogan notes this underground vault was of a beehive shape and cut into the soft rock. The \u0126al-Saflieni Hypogeum in Paola, Malta, is the oldest example of a prehistoric hypogeum, the earliest phase dating to 3600\u20133300 BC; it is a complex of underground chambers, halls and passages covering approximately on three levels, partly carved to imitate temple architecture and containing extensive prehistoric art. In Larnaka, Cyprus\u2014the Lefkaritis Tomb was discovered in 1999. Hypogea were also found in Dynastic Egypt, such as at the Northern Mazghuna pyramid, Southern Mazghuna pyramid and Southern South Saqqara pyramid. The hypogea in ancient Palmyra contained loculi closed with slabs bearing sculptured portrait reliefs, and sarcophagi with sculptured family banqueting scenes on their lids. The later Christians built similar underground shrines, crypts and tombs, which they called catacombs. But this was only a difference in name, rather than purpose and rituals, and archeological and historical research shows they were effectively the same.

Other cultures also have constructed underground structures, including the dugout, souterrain, yaodong, fogou, erdstall, and kiva. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== *Hypogeum of the Volumnis digital media archive (creative commons- licensed photos, laser scans, panoramas), data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership Category:Subterranea (geography) ",
