    "text": "The 2017 North Dakota Fighting Hawks football team represented the University of North Dakota during the 2017 NCAA Division I FCS football season. They were led by fourth-year head coach Bubba Schweigert and played their home games at the Alerus Center. The Fighting Hawks were a member of the Big Sky Conference. They finished the season 3\u20138, 2\u20136 in Big Sky play to finish in a three-way tie for 9th place. This was North Dakota's final year as a full member of the Big Sky. While most of the school's athletic programs will move to the Summit League in 2018, the football program will be classified as an FCS independent in 2018 and 2019 before joining the Missouri Valley Football Conference in 2020. Their games against Big Sky members will still count in the Big Sky standings but they will be ineligible for the Big Sky championship. ==Previous season== In 2016, North Dakota finished with a record of 9\u20133, 8\u20130 in Big Sky play, to share the conference title with Eastern Washington. They qualified for the FCS Playoffs for the first time and lost to Richmond in the second round. ==Schedule== ==Game summaries== ===at Utah=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | colspan=3| First meeting |} ===Missouri State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20131 | 2014 | MSU, 38\u20130 |} ===at South Dakota=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 61\u201329\u20135 | 2016 | UND, 47\u201344 2OT |} ===Montana State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 15\u201318\u20131 | 2016 | UND, 17\u201315 |} ===at UC Davis=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20134 | 2015 | UND, 31\u201324 |} ===Northern Colorado=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 17\u201312 | 2016 | UND, 23\u201313 |} ===at Montana=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 8\u201314\u20131 | 2015 | MONT, 42\u201316 |} ===Sacramento State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20131 | 2016 | UND, 40\u20137 |} ===at Portland State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20132 | 2015 | UND, 19\u201317 |} ===at Southern Utah=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 4\u20134 | 2016 | UND, 45\u201323 |} ===Eastern Washington=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20133 | 2014 | EWU, 54\u20133 |} ==Ranking movements== ==References== North Dakota Category:North Dakota Fighting Hawks football seasons North Dakota Fighting Hawks football ",
