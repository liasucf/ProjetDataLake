    "text": "Ark in the Park is an open sanctuary and conservation project in the Wait\u0101kere Ranges near Auckland. It is a partnership between Forest & Bird and Auckland Council that is supported by Te Kawerau \u0101 Maki that aims to remove non-native pest mammals and predators and re-introduce species that were made extinct in the area. The project was started in 2002 by a small group of volunteers. A pilot programme covering 200 hectares was launched in 2003 which saw bait lines spaced 100m apart through the forest, with bait stations every 50m. By 2019, the project covered 2,270 hectares. == Species reintroduction == Since the beginning of the project, whitehead (), North Island robin (), and kokako have been released. Hihi (stitchbird) were also released but the translocation was not successful. == References == Category:Waitakere City ",
