    "text": "S\u00e9bastien Amoros (born 2 July 1995) is a French professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Championnat National 3 side Cannes. He joined Port Vale in July 2016, following five seasons as a reserve team player at Monaco. He left Port Vale the following year and returned to France to play for RC Grasse. He joined hometown club Cannes in June 2020. ==Career== ===Monaco II=== Born in Cannes, Amoros began his career in the youth team at Monaco. He made his debut for the reserve team in the Championnat de France Amateur at the age of 16, coming on as a 66th-minute substitute for Blanstel Koussalouka in a 4\u20131 win over league champions Uz\u00e8s Pont du Gard on 2 June 2012. He then featured four times in 2012\u201313 as Monaco II finished 12th, five times in the 2013\u201314 season as they finished in eighth place, and did not feature in the 2014\u201315 campaign, but did though make 24 appearances in the 2015\u201316 season as Monaco II finished in third place. ===Port Vale=== He signed a one-year contract with EFL League One side Port Vale in July 2016. Manager Bruno Ribeiro said that he was a \"quality player\", but needed time to adjust to League One. He made his debut in professional football on 27 August, coming on as a 16th-minute substitute for Paulo Tavares in a 3\u20131 win over Scunthorpe United at Vale Park. By mid-December he had started three consecutive games as a holding midfielder, helping the team to go almost four hours without conceding a goal. However he did not feature under caretaker-manager Michael Brown in 2017, and was released at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. Brown said that \"when he could sit in front of the back four and play short passes, that suited him. Once we tried to make it more dynamic and change the style and structure, he didn't really fit into that\". ===RC Grasse=== On 9 July 2018, Amoros signed for French Championnat National 2 team RC Grasse. He featured in 23 of the club's 28 league games during the 2018\u201319 season, helping Grasse to a ninth-place finish. He made 12 appearances during the 2019\u201320 season, which was curtailed early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France with Grasse in second place. ===Cannes=== In June 2020, Amoros joined Championnat National 3 side Cannes after head coach Jean-No\u00ebl Cabezas aimed to build a team of local players. ==Personal life== In 2015, Amoros was dating French reality television personality Martika Caringella. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Monaco II |2011\u201312 ||CFA Group C||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2012\u201313 ||CFA Group C||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |2013\u201314 ||CFA Group C||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |2014\u201315 ||CFA Group C||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2015\u201316 ||CFA Group C||24||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||24||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!34!!0 |- |Port Vale |2016\u201317 ||EFL League One ||10||0||1||0||0||0||2||0||13||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|RC Grasse |2018\u201319 ||Championnat National 2 Group A ||23||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||23||0 |- |2019\u201320 ||Championnat National 2 Group A ||11||1||1||0||0||0||0||0||12||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!35!!1 |- |AS Cannes |2020\u201321 ||Championnat National 3 Group D ||23||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||23||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !78!!1!!2!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!82!!1 |} ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Cannes Category:French footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:AS Monaco FC players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:AS Cannes players Category:Championnat National 2 players Category:English Football League players Category:French expatriate footballers Category:French expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate footballers in England ",
