It was renamed the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on December 5, 1936 by the VIII Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the USSR.Handbook of history of Communist Party and Soviet Union Crimea was under de facto control of Nazi Germany from September 1942 to October 1943, administratively incorporated into as . Alfred Frauenfeld was appointed as General Commissar (although it seems that Frauenfeld spent most of his time in Crimea researching the peninsula's Gothic heritage and the actual government was in the hands of Erich von Manstein).Alan W. Fisher, The Crimean Tatars, 1978, p. 156 In 1944, under the pretext of alleged collaboration of the Crimean Tatars with the Nazi occupation regime, the Soviet government on orders of Joseph Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria deported the Crimean Tatar people from Crimea. Actual collaboration in the military sense had been rather limited, with a recorded 9,225 Crimean Tatars serving in anti-Soviet Tatar Legions and other German formed battalions,Document reproduced in T.S. Kulbaev and A. Iu. Khegai, Deportatsiia (Almaty: Deneker, 2000), pp. 206\u2013207. but there was in fact a surprisingly high degree of co-operation between the occupation government and the local administration; this has been significantly due to Frauenfeld's unwillingness to implement the policy of brutality towards the local population pursued by Erich Koch, which led to a series of public conflict between the two men.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 137. The constitutional rights of the forcibly-resettled Tatars were restored with a decree dated September 5, 1967, but they were not allowed to return until the last days of the Soviet Union.http://www.iccrimea.org/surgun/sovietdecree1967.html The Crimean ASSR was converted into the Crimean Oblast of the RSFSR on June 30, 1945 by the decree of the both presidia of the Supreme Soviet of USSR and the Supreme Soviet of RSFSR (published on May 26, 1946), and the Crimean Oblast was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954.

Raions with national status; Crimean Tatar regions in light blue, Jewish in indigo, German in orange, Ukrainian in yellow On 30 October 1930, the remaining ten raions were reorganized into 16 new ones, and four cities under direct republican control. In 1935, 10 new raions were added and one abolished. In 1937, one more raion was established. Some of the raions had national status for Crimean Tatars, Jews, Germans and Ukrainians. By the beginning of World War II, all of these raions had lost their national status. == Heads of State == ===Russian SFSR=== ;Central Executive Committee * November 7, 1921 \u2013 August 1924 Yuri Gaven (Janis Daumanis) * August 1924 \u2013 January 28, 1928 Veli Ibraimov * January 28, 1928 \u2013 February 20, 1931 Memet Kubayev * February 20, 1931 \u2013 September 9, 1937 Ilyas Tarkhan (arrested on September 8, 1937) * September 9, 1937 \u2013 July 21, 1938 Abdul-Celil Menbariyev ;Supreme Soviet * July 21, 1938 \u2013 May 18, 1944 Abdul-Celil Menbariyev (deported to Middle Asia as part of Stalin's collective punishment for collaboration with the Nazis) * May 18, 1944 \u2013 June 30, 1945 N.Sachiova (acting) ===Ukrainian SSR/Ukraine=== * March 22, 1991 \u2013 May 9, 1994 Mykola Bahrov == Heads of Government == === Chairmen of Revkom === * November 16, 1920 \u2013 February 20, 1921 Bela Kun * February 20, 1921 \u2013 November 7, 1921 Mikhail Poliakov (become the one of NKVD troika) ===Council of People's Commissars=== * November 11, 1921 \u2013 May 16, 1924 Sakhib-Garey Said-Galiyev * May 16, 1924 \u2013 May 1924 I.Goncharov (acting) * May 1924 \u2013 March 21, 1926 Osman Deren-Ayerly * March 21, 1926 \u2013 May 1929 Emir Shugu * May 1929 \u2013 September 16, 1937 Abduraim Samedinov (arrested September 17, 1937) * 1937 \u2013 April 5, 1942 Memet Ibraimov * April 5, 1942 \u2013 May 18, 1944 Ismail Seyfullayev (under de facto control of Nazi Germany during September 1, 1942 to October 23, 1943) * May 18, 1944 \u2013 June 30, 1945 Aleksandr Kabanov ===Council of Ministers=== * March 22, 1991 \u2013 May 20, 1993 Vitaliy Kurashik == Principal Chekists == ;Cheka * until April 1921 Mikhail Vikhman (later in Chernihiv) * April 1921 \u2013 June 1921 Smirnov * June 20, 1921 \u2013 1921 Fyodor Fomin (transferred to Kiev) * November 11, 1921 \u2013 February 1922 Aleksandr Rotenberg ;Crimea GPU * February 1922 \u2013 September 11, 1922 Aleksandr Rotenberg * September 11, 1922 \u2013 April 25, 1923 Stanislav Redens ;Merged GPU * April 25, 1923 \u2013 June 9, 1924 Stanislav Redens * May 20, 1924 \u2013 July 29, 1925 Sergei Szwarz (transferred to the Special department of the Black Sea Navy) * 1925 Aleksandr Toropkin (transferred to Ural) * October 1926 \u2013 April 26, 1928 Ivan Apeter (transferred to the Special department of the Black Sea Navy) ;OGPU * April 26, 1928 \u2013 December 1929 Grigoriy Rapoport (transferred to Belarus Military District) * January 23, 1930 \u2013 July 10, 1934 Eduard Salins (Eduards Sali\u0146\u0161) ;Narkom of State Security * February 26, 1941 \u2013 July 31, 1941 Major Grigoriy Karanadze * October 5, 1943 \u2013 July 5, 1945 Commissar of the 3rd rank Pyotr Fokin == See also == *Crimea Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine *List of Chairmen of the Executive Committee of Crimea == Notes == == References == Category:Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union Category:Early Soviet republics Category:Subdivisions of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic * Category:Former subdivisions of Ukraine Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories Category:States and territories established in 1921 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1945 Category:States and territories established in 1991 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1992 Category:Autonomous republics of Ukraine ",
