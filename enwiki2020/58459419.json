The school has been accredited by international organisations such as the Council of International Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The school was originally located in the Hong Kong Mid- Levels district (the site of a former British military hospital) until the school moved to two campuses in Sha Tin District (known as Campus A (ISSTW): Pok Hong Estate, Sha Tin Wai) and Tai Wai (Campus B (ISTW): Sun Chui Estate, Tai Wai) in December 2017, due to renovations to the former campus. It currently houses around 1,200 students across 33 nationalities. Island School is a registered IB World School and offers the IB diploma program along with an alternative BTEC program in the senior years. ==History == Island School is home to children from a large number of countries. Stephen Loggie is the current principal of Island School. The previous principal was Christopher Binge, who had been secondary principal at the La Ch\u00e2taigneraie campus of the International School of Geneva. Binge studied mathematics at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, was head until June 2009. Binge left to become the head of Markham College. ==Campus== The previous campus of Island School in 2016 The former campus consisted of seven blocks ranging from five to seven floors high, with blocks 1 to 6 arranged in a rectangular fashion. Students could travel to adjacent blocks by linked walkways or footbridges. As the campus was situated on mountainous terrain, blocks located close to the mountain were placed at a higher altitude than their counterparts, and as such the floors between different blocks were often not correlated. The former campus was then demolished and all learning was diverted to the two replacement campuses. The two replacement campuses, Sha Tin Wai and Tai Wai, house two different sets of levels. Sha Tin Wai houses grades 7, 8, 12 and 13, while Tai Wai houses grades 9, 10 and 11. ==Notable alumni and staff== ===Alumni=== * Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg * Mark Chapman, New Zealand and Hong Kong Cricketer *Richard Juan, Actor, TV Host and Entrepreneur *Christine Loh, former Hong Kong Legislative Councillor, founder and CEO of Civic Exchange and founder of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor. *Harry Hill, comedian, author and TV presenter, attended for two years from age 14 * Annemarie Munk, HK Olympic swimmerhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/annemarie-munk-86b95951/ * Alice Patten, actress and daughter of Chris Patten, the former Hong Kong governor *Fiona Sit (Singer and actress)https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1894038/ *Hannah Wilson, HK Olympic swimmer. * Melanie Wilson, GB Olympic rower, silver medal at 2016 Olympics ===Staff=== *Jonty Driver (Principal,1978\u201383), who wrote a book about his experiences at the school ==See also== * Education in Hong Kong ==References== ==External links== * Category:Educational institutions established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Hong Kong ",
