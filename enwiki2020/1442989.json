He studied comparative literature at University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Arts.Pripotovanje hrepenenca -- Toma\u017e Pengov, kantavtor, Mladina, 3 March 2007 ==Work== He recorded his first album Odpotovanja in 1973. This album is considered to be the first independently released record in former Yugoslavia. It was reissued in 1981 in stereo; the original mono edition is very rare now. Pengov sang and played the lute, steel-string acoustic guitar and twelve-string guitar. His music was lauded by many music critics as being original, and his style was very similar to that of the early Leonard Cohen. He took eight years, from 1980 to 1988, to record his second album, Pripovedi (Stories) (1988), recorded with guest musicians. The music is still acoustic, but more varied. In the 1990s, he recorded two more albums, Rimska cesta (Roman road) (1992) and Biti tu (Being here) (1996). In 2011, he published the audiobook Drevo in zvezda (Tree and a star), in which he recites his poems. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1949 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Slovenian poets Category:Slovenian singer-songwriters Category:Slovenian guitarists Category:Slovenian lutenists Category:20th-century poets Category:21st-century poets Category:20th-century Slovenian writers Category:21st-century Slovenian writers Category:20th-century singers Category:21st-century singers Category:20th-century composers Category:21st-century composers Category:People from Ljubljana Category:20th-century guitarists Category:21st- century guitarists ",
