    "text": "Emilio Prud\u2019Homme y Maduro (August 20, 1856- July 21, 1932) was a Dominican lawyer, writer, and educator. Prud\u2019Homme is known for having authored the lyrics of the Dominican National Anthem. He is also attributed with helping establish a national identity, for what was at the time a nascent republic. ==Biography== Emilio Prud\u2019Homme was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic on August 20, 1856 to Ana Maduro and Gen. Pedro Prud\u2019Homme; he had a brother: Lorenzo Fenel\u00f3n Prud\u2019Homme. Prud\u2019Homme excelled in teaching, an activity to which he devoted most of his life. He was a great collaborator and disciple of Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos and taught at \"Perserevancia of Azua\" and also in the \"Liceo Dominicano\" in 1892 and was director of the \"Normal School\", a teaching college founded by Hostos in 1880. He married to Manuela Batista on August 19, 1880, and had one daughter: Ana Emilia Prud\u2019Homme. ==Politics== Prud\u2019Homme was a legislator in the Congress of the Dominican Republic. He served as the President of Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic in 1900 and 1901. He also served as the Secretary of Justice and Social Instruction in the administration of Francisco Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal. Prud\u2019Homme was publicly critical of the United States occupation and as a result was forced to resign his teaching post. As a result, he pursued a career as a lawyer. ==Writing career== Most of his literary works were directed to the exaltation of patriotic values, respect and love for the defense of sovereignty and national independence. His magnum opus being the Dominican National Anthem, which was written in 1883, with music by Jos\u00e9 Rufino Reyes y Siancas. He later modified his work in 1897, when it began to be used at official state functions. Yet, it was not officially the National Anthem until 1934, when then dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo consecrated it as a national symbol and made mandatory its use at state and public functions. ==Bibliography== * \"El 16 de agosto\" (\"The 16th of August\") * \"A la juventud dominicana\" (\"To the Dominican youth\") * \"A mi Patria\" (\"To my homeland\") * \"D\u00e9jame so\u00f1ar\" (\"Let me dream\") * \"Mi tierra m\u00eda\" (\"My land mine\") * \"Himno Nacional Dominicano\" * \"Gloria a la idea\" (\"Glory be to the idea\") * \"Contra hibridismo\" (\"Against hybridism\") * \"A Bol\u00edvar\" (\"To Bol\u00edvar\") * \"Canto a Am\u00e9rica\" (\"Song of America\") ==References== Category:1856 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Dominican Republic lawyers Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic Category:Dominican Republic politicians Category:Dominican Republic male writers Category:Dominican Republic people of French descent Category:People from Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic Category:National anthem writers ",
