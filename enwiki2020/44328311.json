    "text": "The Liar the Bitch and Her Wardrobe is the debut album by English rock band The Scaramanga Six. == Background == Having established themselves on the Yorkshire live circuit between 1995 and 1999, the Huddersfield-based rock band Scaramanga renamed themselves The Scaramanga Six shortly before recording their debut album. The Liar the Bitch and Her Wardrobe was recorded \"in various places\" over sessions across 1997 and 1998, with about half of it produced from a live studio session at the Electric Press complex in Leeds.Scaramanga Six history (1999), from band homepageBandcamp page for The Liar the Bitch and Her Wardrobe Although it was recorded quickly and with minimal overdubs for budgetary restrictions, it did feature a string section and horn players on certain tracks. The Liar the Bitch and Her Wardrobe is the only Scaramanga Six album to feature the band\u2019s original drummer Jem Bowden, and the only one on which Julia Arnez performed as a third lead singer (fronting the band on \"With Deepest Sympathy\" and \"The Man With the Perfect Aim\" and duetting with Steve Morricone on \"Vamp\") and occasional drummer. On all subsequent albums and EPs, Arnez would restrict her vocal contributions to backing or harmony vocals, and play guitar rather than drums. The Liar the Bitch and Her Wardrobe is also the only Scaramanga Six album to have been released on Trinity Records \u2013 the quickly-assembled precursor to the band\u2019s own Wrath Records label, on which all subsequent Scaramanga Six recordings would be released. Produced in a relatively limited run, the album was unavailable for many years afterwards, with Steven Morricone commenting \"Fuck knows where they all went. It\u2019s fair to say that for our first few years we didn\u2019t have a clue what we were doing business-wise, however we have known exactly what we are doing music-wise from the off.\"\"Meet the\u2026 Band: The big rocking Scaramanga Six talk to Sophie Barnes about their new record Songs of Prey\" \u2013 interview by Sophie Barnes, The Leeds Guide, April 29 2009 The album was eventually reissued on Bandcamp as a download-only release, with \"Disenchanted Melody\" and \"Are You One of the Family?\" (two otherwise unavailable songs taken from 2000's Are You One of the Family? EP) added as bonus tracks. Several songs on the album would later be re-recorded for other releases. \"Singer of Songs\" would reappear on the band\u2019s 2001 EP The Continuing Saga of The Scaramanga Six while \"Poison Fang\", \"The Coward\" and \"Horrible Face\" would all be re-recorded for 2004\u2019s Cabin Fever album. The re- recorded \"Horrible Face\" also served as the lead track on a 2005 EP. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ===The Scaramanga Six=== *Paul Morricone \u2013 vocals, guitars, baritone saxophone *Steven Morricone \u2013 vocals, bass guitar, tenor saxophone *Bill Bailey - guitar *Julia Arnez \u2013 vocals, additional drums *John Gulliver \u2013 organ, piano, electric piano, synthesizer *Jem Bowden \u2013 drums ===Guest musicians=== *Paul Swannell, Guy Giblin, Jo Barclay, Suzanne Hurst \u2013 violins *Andrew Moore \u2013 viola *Chris Atkinson \u2013 cello *Pat \"Herb\" Fulgoni \u2013 trumpet *Neil Newson \u2013 tenor saxophone *David Bates \u2013 trombone == References == Category:1999 debut albums Category:The Scaramanga Six albums ",
