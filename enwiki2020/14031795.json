    "text": "J.League 100 Year Plan club status, is a status given to Japanese non-league football clubs. The applicant must have an intention to become a professional club and to join the professional league, J.League, that governs the top three levels of the Japanese football pyramid. Usually clubs from the fourth level, Japan Football League, which is the top tier for amateur clubs, apply for the status; however, it is open for all amateur clubs down to Prefectural leagues. The applications are reviewed and inspected by a committee formed by the league. Since the 2014 season, the Associate Membership is the main criteria for J3 promotion. The system allows the League to identify such clubs, to provide necessary resources/advice, and to ease the transition to professionalism. ==Former associate membership systems== ===1993\u20131998=== Originally, when the professional league was formed in 1993 with ten clubs, the league's intention was to keep the number of clubs to 10 for at least two to three years, and then gradually increase the roster to 16 by adding a club or two in year-to-year basis. However, the league had underestimated the demands; there were far more clubs seeking top-flight football then the league have anticipated. Thus, the league adopted associate membership system for the clubs in then the second-tier Japan Football League. Just like the current system, associate clubs finishing in the top two were allowed to be promoted to the league, given that they have passed the final inspection by the league. Associate members also had the right to participate in Yamazaki Nabisco Cup games and reserve league games. This system was abolished in 1998 with the establishment of J.League Division 2 and the dissolution of the old JFL. Three remaining associate members were admitted to the J2 and Honda FC decided to maintain amateur status and joined the newly created JFL. {|class=\"wikitable\" !Year applied !Club name !Year admitted to J.League !Notes |- |rowspan=\"3\"|1993 |Bellmare Hiratsuka |1994 |Promoted to J.League |- |J\u00fabilo Iwata |1994 |Promoted to J.League |- |Kashiwa Reysol |1995 |Promoted to J.League |- |rowspan=\"3\"|1994 |Cerezo Osaka |1995 |Promoted to J.League |- |Kyoto Purple Sanga |1996 |Promoted to J.League |- |Tosu Futures |1999 (J2) |Taken over by Sagan Tosu.

In their first seven years of co-existence, every club that applied for promotion was individually examined by the league. Five teams were promoted this way, but as the number of applicants increased over time, in October 2005 the JFA initiated the establishment of the new association membership system in order to provide an incentive for amateur clubs to obtain a sound economical and business basis necessary to J.League membership. The criteria for such membership were developed by joint JFA\u2013J.League committee in early 2006. They covered various aspects of the club development, with the particular stress on organizational stability, adequate infrastructure, and support from the local government, sponsors, and community. Unlike the previous system, this membership has been targeted not only to JFL clubs, but to all amateurs club in the football pyramid, including Regional and Prefectural leagues. Below is a list of criteria for associate membership in their last edition as of September 1, 2012. ;Club Organization * Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football. **Company and university clubs do not qualify **At least half of the shares of stock must be Japanese ownership * Must hire at least three administrative employees, one of which must be in a managerial position. * Must have a proper payroll system in accordance with Japanese law. * Must complete an annual tax audit. * Must be financially feasible. :(Note: The league recommends \u00a51.5 million of capital by promotion to J2 and 5 million by the end of the third year in J2.) * Must secure sponsorship of at least \u00a51 million. ;Home Town * Must be approved by respective Prefectural Football Association. * Must be approved by the hometown government in writing. ;Home Stadium/Training Facility * It must have a capacity of at least 10,000 and a natural grass pitch (in lieu of this, the club must have plans to build a stadium to these minimum requirements). * It must be located in the proposed hometown. * It must have a press box and a conference room for pre- and post-match news conferences. * The club must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown. ;Others * The club must currently play in JFL, Regional League, or Prefectural League. * The club must aim for admission to J.League. * The club must have plans for a youth system. The new associate membership system lasted for eight years and came to its logical finish after the number of J2 clubs reached 22 (the original target) in 2012 season. The next year saw the establishment of J3 League which incorporated most of the remaining associate members. Since 2006, 29 clubs have applied for the J.League associate member status and 25 have received it, though for many clubs more than one application was necessary. Of those 25 that received the status, 11 were promoted to J2; 9 more were admitted to J3 League in 2013; and 5 remaining members (along with three pending applications) transitioned to the new 100 Year Plan status in 2014. The table below summarizes the history of associate membership applications and J.League promotions/admissions. Promotions listed were to J2, unless indicated otherwise. *Grey \u2013 membership declined *Light green \u2013 remaining members, transformed into a 100 Year Plan status in 2014 {|class=\"wikitable\" !Applied !Club name !League\u2020 !Home town !Application results !Year admitted to J.League !Notes |- |rowspan=2|August 2006 |Rosso Kumamoto |JFL |Kumamoto, Kumamoto |Approved |2007 |Promoted to J2 as Roasso Kumamoto. |-bgcolor=\"D3D3D3\" |Tochigi SC |JFL |Utsunomiya, Tochigi |Declined | |Reapplied in January 2007 |- |rowspan=4|January 2007 |FC Gifu |JFL |Gifu, Gifu |Approved |2007 |Promoted to J2, approved conditionally at first (financial improvement required before promotion). |- |Gainare Tottori |JFL |All cities/towns in Tottori |Approved |2010 |Promoted to J2. |- |Tochigi SC |JFL |Utsunomiya, Tochigi |Approved |2008 |Promoted to J2. |-bgcolor=\"D3D3D3\" |Perada Fukushima |Tohoku League D2 |Fukushima, Fukushima |Declined | |Renamed to Fukushima United FC.

In order to avoid confusion with associate membership system for future participants, it was decided to change the name of the latter status to \"100 Year Plan\" status. The J.League later abolished the associate membership naming for J3 clubs, but the new name for future members remained. ===Participation criteria=== The criteria for the 100 Year Plan status are largely similar to associate membership of the past, though they are generally more relaxed because of less strict regulations for J3 participation in comparison with J2. Below are the criteria for the 2014 season. ;Club organization * Must be organized as a public corporation or NPO solely devoted to football and exist in this status for no less than one year **The majority of the shares or stock must be Japanese owned * Must employ at least four administrative employees, one of whom must have managerial position * Must have proper payroll system according to Japanese law * Must have proper financial management and conduct annual tax audit * Must hold intellectual rights for the club name, logo, and all associated trademarks ;Home town and stadium/training facility * Must be approved by respective Prefectural Football Association * Must be approved by the hometown government in writing * Home stadium must be located in the proposed hometown * Must secure training facilities within the proposed hometown ;Others * Must currently play in JFL, Regional League, or Prefectural League * Must aim for eventual admission to J.League * Must have a working soccer school/youth system that exists for no less than one year ===Criteria for J3 promotion=== The 100 Year Plan status alone is only a prerequisite for J3 promotion, and the club must comply with additional requirements in order to receive J3 license necessary for promotion. * Must hold a 100 Year Plan status * Must have a stadium that complies with J3 standards (capacity 5,000 or above) and passes the league examination * Must pass a J3 licensing examination by the league * Must finish within top four of JFL, and either 1st or 2nd among other 100 Year Plan holders * Must have average attendance of home games no less than 2,000 spectators, with significant effort demonstrated to reach 3,000 * Must have annual revenue of at least \u00a5150 million, and no excessive debt
