The first episode of Hui Brothers Show was aired on 12 April 1971 as a special program to celebrate Easter and was very well received. As a result, TVB decided to turn it into a regular program which began airing its first season 11 days later on 23 April on Friday nights. The first season ended on 15 October 1971 with a total of 27 episodes including its first episode aired on Easter. The show featured a fresh style and exquisite content including machines gun delivery of jokes. After the end of the first season, audiences wrote letters to TVB requesting the extension of the show. As a result, the show was re-aired on Sunday mornings at the end of 1971. The second season premiered on 14 April 1972. This season took inspiration from the American sketch comedy show, Laugh-In, featuring sitcom and Hong Kong English pop music sung by Samuel Hui. This season featured Samuel's famed Cantonese song, Tit Taap Ling Wan (\u9435\u5854\u51cc\u96f2, literally translated as Steel Tower rise above the clouds), which featured lyrics written by Michael.
