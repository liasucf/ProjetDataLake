Archaeological investigation of the site at the farm St\u00f6\u00f0 in St\u00f6\u00f0varfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur has revealed two Viking-age longhouses, the older of which was (from C-14 dating) built shortly after the year 800. It is thought that the settlement was a seasonal camp for fishing and hunting, rather than a permanent settlement. The modern village arose later on the North shore of the fjord. ==Geography== St\u00f6\u00f0varfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur has a harbour and (since the reclassification of Route 96 (Su\u00f0urfjar\u00f0arvegur) in November 2017) lies on Route 1, at the foot of Hellufjall (859m).
