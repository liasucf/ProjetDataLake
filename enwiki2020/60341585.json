    "text": "Sebiumeker was a major supreme god of procreation and fertility in Meroe, Kush, in present-day Sudan. He is sometimes thought of as a guardian of gateways as his statues are sometimes found near doorways. He has many similarities with Atum, but has Nubian features. ==Etymology== His Meroitic name was probably Sabomakal, which became Sebiumeker in the ancient Egyptian language. ==Role in ancient Kush== Sebiumeker was a major supreme god of procreation and fertility in Meroe, Kush (present-day Sudan). He was referred to as Lord of Musawwarat. His statues have often been found near doorways at the Nubian sites Tabo (Nubia) and Musawwarat es-Sufra, giving rise to the interpretation that he was a guardian god. But another interpretation is that he represented transformation which is why he was placed at the doorways of temples. Though certainly a Nubian god, he has many Egyptian symbols and legends. ==Family== His partner (or maybe brother) was Arensnuphis. This close association with Arensnuphis is similar to the relationship with Seth and Osiris. ==Image== He wore the ancient double crown with a beard and uraeus and had big ears, a mark of importance. With his double crown, false beard, kilt, and tunic, he resembles Atum. A sandstone head without inscription stands in Meroe. It also has the double crown with uraeus. It has several Egyptian looking features, but also has the formal broad Nubian unmodeled planes. ==In popular culture== His worship is invoked in the Gifts of the Nile scenario in the video game Civilization VI. ==References== Category:Egyptian gods Category:Fertility gods Category:Liminal deities Category:Nubian gods ",
