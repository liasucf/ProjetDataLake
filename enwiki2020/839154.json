    "text": "Before the advent of the Open era of tennis competitions in April 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in established tournaments, including the four Majors. There was no prize money and players were compensated for travel expenses only. However many top tennis players turned professional to play legally for prize money in the years before the open era. They played in separate professional events, mostly on tours involving head-to-head competition, but also in professional tournaments as the biggest events on the pro tour. Professional tournaments, in particular the professional Majors, usually only had a men's draw. == Professional Majors == In addition to the head-to-head tours, there were the annual professional tournaments called Championship tournaments, where the world's top professional male players played. These tournaments held with a certain tradition and longevity. According to Ellsworth Vines, \"the Wembley tournament in London..., the U.S. professional championship, and to some extent the tournament in Paris were the major professional tournaments prior to 1968.\"Tennis Myth and Method (1978), Ellsworth Vines and Gene Vier (), page 52 The oldest of these three Professional Majors, or \"Pro Slams\", was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played at a variety of different venues and on a variety of different surfaces, between 1927 and 1999. The most prestigious of the three was generally the Wembley Championship. Played between 1934 and 1990, at the Wembley Arena in England, it was unofficially usually considered the world's championship until 1967. The third professional major was the French Pro Championship, played between 1934 and 1968, on the clay-courts of Roland Garros, apart from 1963 to 1967, when it was played on the indoor wood courts of Stade Coubertin. Jack Kramer designated the four major professional tournaments for the 1958/1959 seasons as follows; Forest Hills, Kooyong, L.A. Masters, Sydney.World Tennis, November, 1958 ===U.S. Pro Tennis Championships=== The U.S. Pro Tennis Championship, also known as the US Pro, was an annual tournament, later known as MFS Pro Championships. It was first organized by player Vinnie Richards when promoter C. C. Pyle withdrew interest in the project. It was first played on the Notlek courts located at 119th Street and Riverside Drive, Manhattan. The tournament was held at various locations in several states until 1964, when it moved to the Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. ===French Pro Championship=== The French Pro Championship was first held in 1930, held by the \"Association Fran\u00e7aise des Professeurs de Tennis (AFPT)\", entitled \"Championnat International de France Professionnel\" (French Pro Championships) on June 18\u201322, 1930. From 1930 the French Pro Championship was always played at Paris, on outdoor clay at Roland Garros except from 1963 to 1967 where it was held at Stade Pierre de Coubertin on indoor wood. ===Wembley Championship=== The Wembley Championship, also known as the Wembley Pro, was held at the Wembley Arena, in London. This professional event ran from 1934 to 1967 and was originally played on a wood surface placed over the top of a drained pool. It was officially known as the \"London Indoor Professional Championships\" from 1951 through 1967. ==List of Professional Majors champions== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year ! style=\"width:200px;\"| US Pro ! style=\"width:200px;\"| Wembley Pro ! style=\"width:200px;\"| French Pro |- |1927 || Vinnie Richards || style=\"background:#ececec;

Since the professional circuit was less organized and somewhat less popular than the amateur circuit, the professional events hierarchy changed each year. In 1934 the US Pro was a high-class tournament with all top ranked pro players whereas in 1936 it was a meeting between pro teachers without any leading pro players. A tournament could even be canceled at any time due to poor attendance. Consequently, for a given year a pro tournament was important when it attracted the best pro players and then another year this same tournament could be a second-rank tournament because few or no leading players came. Before the open era in addition to numerous small tournaments and head-to-head tours between the leading professionals, there were some major tournaments which stood out at different periods. Some survived sporadically because of financial collapses while others temporarily rose to the highest levels of competition when other tournaments weren't held. These include: ===Bristol Cup: 1920\u20131932=== Sometimes labelled \"Professional Championships of France\" this tournament was held on the French Riviera at Menton, at Cannes.
