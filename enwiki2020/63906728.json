    "text": "\"God's Great Banana Skin\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Chris Rea, released in 1992 as the second single from his twelfth studio album God's Great Banana Skin. The song was written and produced by Rea. \"God's Great Banana Skin\" reached No. 31 in the UK Singles Chart and remained in the charts for three weeks. ==Background== Rea was inspired to write the song after he noticed his daughter was tempted to laugh at \"somebody who'd been giving her a hard time\". Rea told John Pidgeon in 1992: \"I told her 'don't laugh when people go down even if they've been awful to you because you're tempting God to throw you a banana skin'. It's half moral and half superstition. Anybody who's done me a disservice in life, and I see them go down, you get tempted to laugh. I don't know whether it's superstition or not, or I daren't laugh just in case God throws me a banana skin as well.\" ==Critical reception== Upon release, Robert Tilli of Music & Media wrote: \"The tag line of the title track, sung in a dark threatening voice, is easy to sing along with, making it the ideal second single. The wailing harmonica in the background matches perfectly with the November rain and storms.\" In a review of the album, Vlado Forgac of The Morning Star commented: \"On the title track, Rea offers a humorous look at his own perception of faith.\" Lynn Saxberg of the Ottawa Citizen noted the \"cryptic message\" of the song and how it \"addresses the superstitious idea that bad luck will come not only to those who think they're better than others, but also people who think they're inferior\". ==Track listing== 7\" and cassette single # \"God's Great Banana Skin\" (Remix) \u2013 4:16 # \"I Saw You Coming\" \u2013 4:30 CD single # \"God's Great Banana Skin\" (Remix) \u2013 4:16 # \"Just Passing Through\" (Live) \u2013 6:09 # \"Footprints in the Snow\" (Live) \u2013 4:32 # \"Winter Song\" \u2013 4:32 CD single (UK limited edition release) # \"God's Great Banana Skin\" (Remix) \u2013 4:16 # \"I Saw You Coming\" \u2013 4:30 # \"She's Gonna Change Everything\" \u2013 4:46 # \"You Must Be Evil\" (Live) \u2013 4:47 ==Personnel== Production * Chris Rea - producer of \"God's Great Banana Skin\", \"I Saw You Coming\" and \"She's Gonna Change Everything\" * Neil Amor - engineer on \"God's Great Banana Skin\", \"I Saw You Coming\" and \"She's Gonna Change Everything\" * Targa Flurio - remix of \"God's Great Banana Skin\" * Jon Kelly - producer of \"Winter Song\" Other * Chris Welch - banana illustration * Stylorouge - artwork ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1992) !Peak position |- | German Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|59 |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|31 |} ==References== Category:1992 songs Category:1992 singles Category:East West Records singles Category:Songs written by Chris Rea Category:Chris Rea songs ",
