J\u00f3zef Sawa-Cali\u0144ski's gorget neoclassical palace ruins of Castle Szre\u0144sk the Confederates of Bar stronghold Born in Stepashky on Southern Bug to colonel Sawa a Cossack and a Polish noble, little is known of his early life. After the outbreak of hostilities following the proclamation of the Confederation of Bar in 1768, Sawa-Cali\u0144ski organized a partisan unit of roughly 2000 armed men. He then engaged in partisan warfare in various parts of Poland, mostly against Russian garrisons and units. He successfully evaded being captured and styled himself a Cossack, which added to his popularity among the gentry, who even elected him a marshal of the land of Wyszogr\u00f3d. Antoni Madali\u0144ski and J\u00f3zef Ku\u017ama were belong to his partizan unit. However, on 26 April 1771 his troop was finally surrounded near Szre\u0144sk and defeated by the Russians. J\u00f3zef Sawa-Cali\u0144ski was heavily wounded in the battle, yet he avoided being captured and hid himself in the forests and villages nearby. Sold to the Russians by one of the peasants, he was imprisoned and perished soon afterwards. Died in Przasnysz after a few days. His life was immortalized by Juliusz S\u0142owacki in his Beniowski (poem based on Maurice Benyovszky's life), Sen srebrny Salomei (en: The Silver Dream of Salomea\"), Henryk Rzewuski, Pami\u0105tki Soplicy. ==References== * Category:1730s births Category:1771 deaths Category:People from Haisyn Raion Category:Polish nobility Category:Polish Cossacks Category:Bar confederates Category:Military personnel of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ",
