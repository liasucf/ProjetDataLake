He was Deacon (President) of the Incorporation of Surgeons and Barbers of Edinburgh. == Early life and education == John Naysmith was the younger son of Sir Michael Naysmyth (or Nasmyth) of Posso (1516\u20131607), Chamberlain to John Hamilton, the archbishop of St Andrews.Comrie, J.D. History of Scottish Medicine to 1860 (London, Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, 2nd ed. 1932), p. 174 His mother was Elizabeth,(1503-1606) daughter of John Baird of Posso (1483\u20131526), owner of the estate of that name in Peebles-shire.Michael Naesmyth https://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/michael- naesmyth_19269434 His elder brother James Naysmith inherited the Posso estate and became falconer to King James VI. John Naysmyth's early education was at St Mary's College, St Andrews after which he was apprenticed to the surgeon Gilbert Primrose in Edinburgh.Anderson, William. The Scottish nation; or.

Historical sketch of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, Sutherland and Knox, 1860. https://archive.org/details/b2145209x == Career == Like his father he was an active supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that he was a member of Lord Seton's party, a small select group who were entrusted to journey to England in 1575, ostensibly to pay homage to Queen Elizabeth, but in reality to smuggle letters to the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots from the Scottish Regent, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. This was achieved successfully, and, as a result of his part in this exploit he found favour with the teenage King James VI. However, in 1575 Alexander Naysmyth lived in London and was questioned in April 1575 with others in England about letters delivered to Mary Queen of Scots by her supporters, not Regent Morton, notably a London book seller, Henry Cockyn. Naysymth, according to Cockyn, took Mary's letters to the French ambassador.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 120-134. Naysmyth was at the siege of Lochmaben Castle in June 1588 and attended a soldier dying from gunshot wounds. He accompanied James VI to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet his bride Anne of Denmark. He bought sugar confections called \"scrotchets and confitures\" in Copenhagen for the return journey, sweets which were thought to help sea-sickness.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 41, 43, 48. In an era of vacillating political loyalty he was suspected of involvement in the 1591 plot against the King by Francis Stewart 5th Earl of Bothwell. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle then Dumbarton Castle. Anne of Denmark interceded for him.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 621, 631-2, 641, 648. He was ordered by the Privy Council to go abroad under caution of 1000 merks (\u00a3666 Scots). The caution was subsequently deleted by warrant of the King on 1 August 1593.Dingwall, HM. \u2018Nasmyth , John (1556/7\u20131613)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 May 2017 He fled to France where he became Chief Surgeon to the Scots Guards of the King of France.Forbes-Leith, William. The Scots Men at Arms in France. Vol 2; Edinburgh,W.

Gilbert Primrose, his surgical master had been surgeon to King James VI and became Serjeant-Surgeon to King James VI and I when the King and his court moved to London. Presumably as a result of Primrose\u2019s patronage Naysmith was made a surgeon to King James VI, and he too moved with the Court to London on the occasion of the Union of the Crowns. King James VI, now King James I made him Royal Herbalist for life. During his time in London he attended Prince Henry during his fatal illness.Dingwall, Helen.
