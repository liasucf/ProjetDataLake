It is located on the corner of Largo Monsignor Muzi and Via Luca Signorelli, and adjacent to the Piazza di San Giovanni in Campo, in the center of Citt\u00e0 di Castello, region of Umbria, Italy. ==History== The Dominican order was introduced in the city in 1269, and was affiliated with a number of different churches. Construction of this austere brick church was begun in 1400 and completed in 1424. The fa\u00e7ade is unfinished. On the left side are the square bell tower and the ogival portal dating to the 14th-century. In 1724, the interior was refurbished, removing nine lateral altars.Guida storico-artistica di Citt\u00e0 di Castello, by Eugenio Mannucci, (1878), page 154-155. The church contains mostly fragmentary and restored frescoes inside; in 1911 many of the Baroque additions to the structure were removed. On the left wall, next to the side door, is a depiction of Saint Anthony (1426), facing the wall opposite a Crucifixion, both attributed to Antonio Alberti. On the left side of the nave are three chapels with pointed arch entrances, one of which is dedicated to the Fallen in War and retains a 14th-century fresco depicting the Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John. At the end of the aisle, the two altars once displayed respectively two Renaissance masterpieces, a Crucifixion (1503) by Raphael for the family Gavari, The Mond Crucifixion is now on display in the National Gallery, London.; the other, a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (1498) by Luca Signorelli, for the family Brozzi and now in the Pinacoteca Comunale of the town. The main altar of the church contains the tomb of Blessed Margaret (1287-1320), Dominican tertiary, called the Blind of Metola, from the place where she was born. The presbytery houses a precious wooden choir, called the Coro Manno, being carved and inlaid in 1435 by the Florentine Manno Benincasa.
