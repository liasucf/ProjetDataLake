The Naughty Naughty Pets was part of a bid by the broadcaster to target older youth audiences in its children's programming alongside other new series like Yam Roll, The Morgan Waters Show and Mr. Meaty. The channel initially skipped the show's seventh episode, \"Heedley Pecked Me In The Eye\", in their first run through the show for unexplained reasons. It later aired on June 12, 2006. Internationally, The Naughty Naughty Pets has aired on Canal Once in Mexico, NHK in Japan, Kids Central in Singapore, CITV in the UK and ABC in Australia. ==References== Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2000s Canadian children's television series Category:2006 Canadian television series debuts Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:CBC Television original programming ",
