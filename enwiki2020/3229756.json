    "text": "Berlin-Lichtenberg is a railway station in Berlin, Germany. It is located on the Eastern Railway, Wriezen Railway and Berlin Frankfurter Allee\u2013Berlin- Rummelsburg railway lines in the Lichtenberg district. The station is also part of the Berlin S-Bahn and U-Bahn ( line) network. During the division of the city, Lichtenberg with its extended railyards became the central transport facility of East Berlin, together with Berlin Ostbahnhof. Today, the station mainly provides regional rail service to the eastern and northern environs. ==Overview== Railway tracks, view from Lichtenberger Br\u00fccke The station building marks the southeastern border of the Lichtenberg quarter and is primarily accessible from the Weitlingstra\u00dfe neighbourhood in the adjacent Rummelsburg locality. North of it, the Frankfurter Allee, part of the Bundesstra\u00dfe 1/5 highway, crosses the tracks on the eight-lane Lichtenberger Br\u00fccke (Lichtenberg Bridge). Until 2006, international trains to Kaliningrad, Warsaw, Kiev, Minsk, Moscow and Siberia (among others Omsk, Novosibirsk and Kazakhstan) used to stop at Berlin-Lichtenberg. However, after the completion of Berlin Hauptbahnhof, these trains now stop there. Night trains from all parts of Germany still terminate at this station, however, as do some trains from Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Lichtenberg was featured in the opening scene of the 2007 movie The Bourne Ultimatum where it was made to look like a Moscow train station. ==History== A first marshalling yard at the site was late out in the 1870s, following the opening of the Prussian Eastern Railway line to Strausberg and K\u00fcstrin in 1867 and the first sections of the Berlin Ringbahn at nearby Ostkreuz station in 1871. Passenger trains stopped here from 1881 onwards; the station was renamed Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde the next year. Long-distance trains, however, ran via Schlesischer Bahnhof (the present-day Ostbahnhof) to the central Berlin Stadtbahn line. The Wriezen Railway branch- off was opened in 1898. After the area was incorporated into Berlin by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act, Lichtenberg received access to the electrified S-Bahn commuter rail network in 1928. The subway station, built in the New Objectivity style according to plans designed by Alfred Grenander, was opened on 21 December 1930. Zentralfriedhof ('Central Cemetery') was then added to the name; from 1935 the station was called \"Bahnhof Lichtenberg\". During World War II, it served as an air raid shelter. Train services ceased during the Battle of Berlin on 23 April 1945, but were resumed only a month later under Soviet occupation. Passenger tunnel After the war, the Deutsche Reichsbahn authority had Lichtenberg gradually rebuilt as the main train station of East Berlin, providing direct connections with the Ringbahn line and the Berlin outer ring. An additional platform for suburban trains was opened in 1952, accessible via a passenger tunnel above the U-Bahn tracks which has only a ceiling height of .J.

A new entrance hall was inaugurated on 15 December 1982. Since German reunification, Lichtenberg station has declined in importance, mainly with the opening of the Berlin North-South mainline in 2006. Nevertheless, large parts of the facilities have been restored and modernised in recent years. ==Train services== The station is served by the following service(s):Timetables for Berlin-Lichtenberg station *EuroNight services Paris - Strasbourg - Berlin - Poznan - Warsaw - Brest - Minsk - Moscow *Local services Templin \u2013 L\u00f6wenberg \u2013 Oranienburg \u2013 Berlin *Local services Eberswalde \u2013 Berlin \u2013 K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen \u2013 L\u00fcbben \u2013 Senftenberg *Local services Werneuchten \u2013 Ahrensfelde \u2013 Berlin *Local services Berlin \u2013 Strausberg \u2013 Werbig \u2013 Kostrzyn (\u2013 Gorzow Wielkopolski \u2013 Krzyz) *Local services Rheinsberg \u2013 L\u00f6wenberg \u2013 Oranienburg \u2013 Berlin *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau \u2013 Westkreuz \u2013 Hauptbahnhof \u2013 Alexanderplatz \u2013 Ostbahnhof \u2013 Lichtenberg \u2013 Strausberg Nord *Berlin S-Bahn services Potsdam \u2013 Wannsee \u2013 Westkreuz \u2013 Hauptbahnhof \u2013 Alexanderplatz \u2013 Ostbahnhof \u2013 Lichtenberg \u2013 Ahrensfelde *Berlin S-Bahn services Warschauer Stra\u00dfe \u2013 Ostkreuz \u2013 Lichtenberg \u2013 Wartenberg == Gallery == Image:Train station Berlin Lichtenberg 2.jpg|Overview Image:Train station Berlin Lichtenberg 3.jpg|S-Bahn-Platform Image:U-Bahn Berlin Lichtenberg vor Sanierung.JPG|The Berlin underground station Lichtenberg in 2004 before renovation (line U5) Image:U-Bahn Berlin Lichtenberg 2.JPG|Sign of the Berlin underground station Lichtenberg (line U5) Image:U-Bahnhof Lichtenberg.jpg|The Berlin underground station Lichtenberg after renovation (line U5) \u2013 Now with brighter colours File: NEB VT 736 1.jpg|Bombardier Talent in the station ==References== Lichtenberg Lichtenberg Lichtenberg Lichtenberg ",
