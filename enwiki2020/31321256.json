The season began on 2 May 2011 and was planned to end on 9 August 2011, lasting 100 days. However, the network announced that the season would be extended by 5 weeks. As a result, it lasted 135 days and ended on 12 September 2011. The launch show was hosted by Sonja Zietlow while the rest of the season was hosted by Aleksandra Bechtel, the presenter from seasons 2 to 4 and 10. Rayo di Sole was crowned the winner of the season and won \u20ac125,000. == Format == Big Brother has chosen 30 hopefuls to move into the house. 14 housemates were chosen by Big Brother and the final housemate was picked by a public vote. Each housemate had a secret which one has to keep in the house, otherwise the housemate will automatically face eviction and the housemate who guessed it correctly will receive immunity from evictions and final ticket, but an incorrect guess will also result in facing eviction. However, the housemate will only have the ticket as long as no other secret is disclosed. The ticket will be going over until a certain point in the series where the owner will have the ticket for good and be a finalist. Furthermore, housemates will nominate every two weeks with the housemates with the most votes face eviction. They will participate in weekly tasks and matches for treats or to avoid punishments. == Housemates == *Cosimo Citiolo, 29 from Stuttgart *Dagmar \"Daggy\" Szlachta, 31 from Hemer *David Ortega Arenas, 25 from Dortmund *Fabienne Hohlstein, 26 from Berlin *Hedia Quirhani, 22 from Siegen *Ingrid Pavic, 25 from Munich *Jasmin Rapior, 21 from Bad Vilbel *Jordan Kane (Michelle Br\u00fcse), 18 from Freirachdorf *Lisa Bund, 22 from Frankfurt am Main *Rayo di Sole (Marc Sonnen), 27 from Lochum *Ren\u00e9 Kirsten, 25 from Leipzig *Steve Brauer, 26 from Gera *Tim Tschirch, 24 from Kamen *Tim \"Timmy\" Hohlstein, 26 from Berlin *Valencia Vintage, 19 (in fact 21) from Cologne === Intruders === *Alex Nad, 26 from Wagh\u00e4usel *Barry Hammerschmidt, 21 from Berlin *Benny Kieckh\u00e4ben, 21 from Worms *Benson Aksoy, 34 from Essen *Florian Wess, 24 from Cologne *Jaquelina Meys, 20 from Remscheid *Leon Valje (Heiko Kuhrmann), 34 from Hamburg == Secrets == {| class=\"wikitable sortable centre\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;\" !Name !Secret !Discovered by |- |Alex |\"He hasn't had a mobile phone for 8 years\" |Undiscovered |- |Barry |\"He is a member of a Zulu-chief family\" |Undiscovered |- |Benny |\"He is the new Big Brother mole\" |Rayo (Day 88) |- |Benson |\"She owns 500 pairs of shoes\" |Cosimo (Day 92) |- |Cosimo |\"He is a philatelist\" |Undiscovered |- |Daggy |\"Her face was printed on 500,000 beer bottles\" |Undiscovered |- |David |\"He was bullied in school because he was overweight\" |Undiscovered |- |Fabienne |\"They are married\" (with Timmy) |Daggy (Day 22) |- |Florian |\"He works every Sunday together with disabled people\" |Undiscovered |- |Hedia |\"She is a virgin\" |Ren\u00e9 (Day 13) |- |Ingrid |\"She is afraid of the dark\" |Cosimo (Day 59) |- |Jaquelina |\"She is cross-eyed when stressed\" |Undiscovered |- |Jasmin |\"She is praying every night before she goes to bed\" |Undiscovered |- |Jordan |\"She is an arachnophobiac\" |Ren\u00e9 (Day 32) |- |Leon |\"He flew from East Germany as a kid\" |Undiscovered |- |Lisa |\"She has an compulsive-obsessive disorder and has to do everything three times\" |Jasmin (Day 27) |- |Rayo |\"He has moved in with his guardian angel\" |Undiscovered |- |Ren\u00e9 |\"He won the Mr. Saxony contest in 2005\" |Undiscovered |- |Steve |\"He is a Big Brother mole\" |Big Brother/Himself (Day 26) |- |Tim |\"He can speak with two different voices\" |Hedia (Day 12) |- |Timmy |\"They are married\" (with Fabienne) |Daggy (Day 22) |- |Valencia |\"She had to spend 3 days in prison as a teenager\" |Ingrid (Day 19) |} ==Nominations Table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:15px; width:100%\" |- ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:5%\" | ! style=\"width:10%\" colspan=\"2\"| Final ! style=\"width:5%\" | Nominations received |- !
