    "text": "Life 102: What to Do When Your Guru Sues You is a book by Peter McWilliams. Couched in the tone of the author's Life 101 self-help books, it levels a series of allegations against John-Roger (Roger Delano Hinkins), founder of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness (MSIA) and Insight Seminars. These allegations caused the book, self-published in 1994 under McWilliams' Prelude Press imprint, to itself become the subject of litigation for libel. Remaining copies were withdrawn from sale. The volume discusses in detail McWilliams's own experiences over a 15-year period: McWilliams describes his struggle with depression, and claims that Hinkins promised him \"spiritual healing\" in exchange for crediting \"John-Roger\" as co-author of a series of self- improvement manuals which later made the New York Times best-seller lists. Hinkins sued McWiliams for libel, and in due course obtained full rights to Life 102. The volume has been out of print ever since. When the book later appeared on another website without permission, McWilliams sent a notarized letter requesting the site owner remove it: McWilliams died in June 2000. ==References== == External links == *MSIA v.
