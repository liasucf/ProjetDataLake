Bo'ness United are the reigning champions but cannot defend their title after being promoted to the Lowland Football League. The start of the league season was delayed until October 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and games are being played behind closed doors due to Scottish Government restrictions. ==Teams== The following teams changed division after the 2019\u201320 season. ===To East of Scotland Football League=== Returned from Abeyance * Eyemouth United Transferred from East Superleague North * Luncarty Transferred from East Superleague South * Kennoway Star Hearts * Lochore Welfare * Thornton Hibs Transferred from East Premier League South * Kirkcaldy & Dysart * Lochgelly Albert * Newburgh * Rosyth Edinburgh South also joined having previously played in the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football League. ===From East of Scotland Football League=== Promoted to Lowland Football League * Bo'ness United ==Premier Division== ===Teams=== No clubs were relegated at the end of the 2019\u201320 season.
