Rojas scored the match winning goal for Chile in the 90th minute against Yugoslavia in the 1962 World Cup; his goal secured a third place finish for the World Cup hosts, which is Chile's best finish in the tournament to date. Rojas was also a starter on the River Plate teams of the 1960s that fiercely contested the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n title. While Rojas never won the title, River Plate did manage to place second in 1962 and 1963 as well as third in 1964. ==Teams== * Everton 1954\u20131962 * River Plate 1962\u20131965 * Colo- Colo 1965\u20131967 * Everton 1967\u20131968 ==External links== * Profile at FIFA.com Profile at Category:1934 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Chilean footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Chilean expatriate footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Colo- Colo footballers Category:Everton de Vi\u00f1a del Mar footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:1962 FIFA World Cup players Category:Association football midfielders ",
