The win sent McCarville to her sixth national Scotties Tournament of Hearts. For the third straight year, the final featured the McCarville rink from Thunder Bay against the Tracy Fleury rink from Sudbury. McCarville had won the Northern Ontario in 2016 as well, and went all the way to the finals of the 2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Despite this, the Fleury team were the higher ranked rink going into the tournament. In the final, Team McCarville stole single points in the 4th and 5th points and then two points in the sixth end en route to winning the Northern Ontario championship. The event was a double-round robin, from which the top two teams played in a final match for the championship. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Skip !! Third !! Second !! Lead !! Alternate !!
