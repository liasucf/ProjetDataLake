    "text": "Mar\u00eda Antonia Bandr\u00e9s El\u00f3segui (6 March 1898 \u2013 27 April 1919) was a Spanish Roman Catholic professed religious from the Daughters of Jesus. She lived a brief life but was noted for her ardent faith and her Marian devotion while also being known for the effect she had on the faithful as well as agnostics whom she came into contact with. The beatification process for the late El\u00f3segui opened in 1982 \u2013 she was then titled as a Servant of God \u2013 and she later became Venerable in 1995. Pope John Paul II beatified her in mid-1996. ==Life== Mar\u00eda Antonia Bandr\u00e9s El\u00f3segui was born in Tolosa \u2013 in the Kingdom of Spain \u2013 as the second of fifteen children born to Ramon Bandr\u00e9s and Teresa El\u00f3segui. Her paternal uncle and godfather was Antonio Bandr\u00e9s. Her siblings and parents often referred to her as \"Antonita\". Bandr\u00e9s El\u00f3segui attended a school that the Daughters of Spain managed in her town and she later entered the religious life in that order in Salamanca on 8 December 1915 \u2013 the Feast of the Immaculate Conception \u2013 during World War I. In 1913 while making the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius she met the Daughter's founder Candida Maria of Jesus who said to her: \"You will be a Daughter of Jesus\". She made her solemn religious profession on 31 May 1918 and then fell ill that June, marking the start of a long illness and then death ten months later. Her confessor around this time was Fr. Ilario Oscoz. Her doctor \u2013 Filiberto Villalobos \u2013 testified that he was moved as he cared for the nun due to her ardent spirit and her commitment to the faith. Her death impacted the agnostic doctor as well as Miguel de Unamuno and Indalecio Prieto who left either oral or written testimonies about the impact her death had on them. She died on 27 April 1919 while singing a Marian song. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced with the inauguration of an informative process in Salamanca that opened on 23 January 1962. This concluded the following year after her writings were checked by theologians who certified their orthodoxy, on 10 July 1970, leading to the formal introduction of her cause on 11 May 1982, which entitled her to the title Servant of God. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated these two previous processes in Rome on 27 January 1983 and received the official Positio dossier in 1989 for further evaluation. Theologians assented to the contents of the dossier on 28 June 1994 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S.did so on 10 January 1995. She became titled as Venerable on 6 April 1995 after Pope John Paul II confirmed the fact that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in Spain and received full validation on 12 May 1995 from the C.C.S. before a medical team examined the miracle in question and voiced their approval of it on 11 January 1996; theologians also assented on 29 March 1996 and the C.C.S. as well on 16 April 1996. The pope issued his final approval of this on 30 April 1996 and later beatified her in Saint Peter's Square on 12 May 1996. The current postulator for this cause is Sister Ana Maria Cinco. ==References== ==External links== *Hagiography Circle Category:1898 births Category:1919 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century Spanish people Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:People from Tolosa Category:Spanish beatified people Category:Spanish Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ",
