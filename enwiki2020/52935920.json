    "text": "Ian Cheng (born March 29, 1984) is an American artist known for his live simulations that explore the capacity of living agents to deal with change. His simulations, commonly understood as \"virtual ecosystems\" are less about the wonders of new technologies than about the potential for these tools to realize ways of relating to a chaotic existence. His work has been widely exhibited internationally, including MoMA PS1, Serpentine Galleries, Whitney Museum of American Art, Hirshhorn Museum, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Migros Museum, and other institutions. ==Early life and education== Cheng was born in Los Angeles, CA, in 1984. Cheng attended Van Nuys High School. Cheng graduated from University of California, Berkeley in 2006 with a dual degree in cognitive science and art practice. Cheng worked at Industrial Light & Magic, George Lucas's visual effects company. Cheng attended Columbia University, where he earned his MFA in 2009. Cheng worked in the studio of artist Pierre Huyghe from 2010 to 2012 and also worked as co-director at Paul Chan's independent New York based publishing company, Badlands Unlimited, founded in 2010. ==Work== Cheng popularized the use of simulation as a medium available to artistic practice, capable of composing together both man-made and algorithmically generated content that together produce emergent behavior over an infinite duration. Cheng's work highlights the capacity of simulation to express the unpredictable dynamic between order and chaos in a complex system. Cheng coined the term \u201clive simulation\u201d as a subset of simulation that is presented in public in real-time without regard for an optimal outcome or pre-defined fitness criteria. Since 2013, Cheng has produced a series of simulations exploring an AI-based agent\u2019s capacity to deal with an ever- changing environment. From 2015 to 2017, Cheng developed Emissaries, a trilogy of episodic live simulations that \u201cexplore the history of cognitive evolution, past and future.\u201d Unlike previous simulations, Emissaries introduced a narrative agent, the emissary, whose motivation to enact a story was set into conflict with the open-ended chaos of the simulation. Cheng describes the archetype of the emissary as one who \"is caught between unravelling old realities and emerging weird one,\" an embodied way to explore the relationship between meaning and meaninglessness. Cheng drew inspiration from the narrative nature of consciousness described by Julian Jaynes in The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. At Serpentine Galleries in 2018, Cheng premiered BOB (Bag of Beliefs), an AI-based creature whose personality, body, and life script evolve across exhibitions in what Cheng calls \u201cart with a nervous system.\u201d BOB premiered in the United States in 2019 at Gladstone Gallery. BOB features a unique model of AI that combines an inductive engine for the learning of rule-based beliefs from sensory experiences with a motivational framework composed of mini-personalities called \"demons\". Each demon competes for control of BOB's body in a \"congress of demons\", and each utilizes the inductive engine to achieve its motivations while minimizing surprise. Viewers were invited to send their own stream of stimuli to BOB through BOB Shrine, an iOS app. ==Other activities== Cheng directed the music video Brats, by Liars. At Frieze London in 2013, Cheng premiered Entropy Wrangler Cloud, one of the first artworks made for virtual reality, using first generation Oculus Rift headsets. Cheng developed Bad Corgi, an iOS app commissioned by Serpentine Galleries, which has been called a \"shadowy mindfulness app for contemplating chaos.\" == Exhibitions == *Emissaries at Fundacion Fernando de Castro, 2020 *Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI at de Young Museum, 2020 *Mud Muses at Moderna Museet, Stockholm, 2019 *If the Snake at Okayama Art Summit, 2019 *May You Live in Interesting Times at 58th Venice Biennale, 2019 *New Order: Art and Technology in the Twenty-First Century at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2019 *BOB at Gladstone Gallery, 2019 *BOB at Serpentine Galleries, 2018 *Emissaries at Julia Stoschek Collection, 2018 *Etre moderne: Le MoMA \u00e0 Paris at Fondation Louis Vuitton, 2017 *Being There at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, 2017 *Ian Cheng at Carnegie Museum of Art, 2017 *Emissaries at MoMA PS1, 2017 *\"Ten Days Six Nights\" at Tate Modern, 2017 *Forking at Perfection at Migros Museum, 2016 *Dreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art 1905\u20132016 at Whitney Museum of American Art, 2016 *Take Me (I\u2019m Yours), Jewish Museum, New York, 2016 *Liverpool Biennial 2016, Liverpool, 2016 *WELT AM DRAHT, Julia Stoschek Collection, Berlin, 2016 *Suspended Animation, curated by Gianni Jetzer, Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, 2016 *Stranger, Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, 2016 *Emissary Forks At Perfection at Pilar Corrias, London, 2015 *Emissary in the Squat of Gods, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, 2015 *\"Real Humans\", curated by Elodie Evers, Irina Raskin, Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf, 2015 *Ian Cheng, curated by Filipa Ramos, Triennale Di Milano, Milan, 2014 ==Collections== Cheng's work is collected by institutions including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Migros Museum, Zurich; Louis Vuitton Foundation, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo; Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Julia Stoschek Collection, Dusseldorf; Yuz Museum, Shanghai. == References == == External links == * *Ian Cheng: Emissary's Guide to Worlding * Ian Cheng: Forking at Perfection * Ian Cheng: Live Simulations * Pilar Corrias Gallery * Gladstone Gallery * Standard(OSLO) Category:1984 births Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Living people Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:People from the San Fernando Valley Category:Van Nuys High School alumni ",
