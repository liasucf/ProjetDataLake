    "text": "Top Billing is a South African lifestyle television programme that airs on SABC3 on Saturday evenings from 18:00\u201319:00 and repeats on Sundays at 12:00. It was founded by Basetsana Kumalo and Patience Stevens, who own the Tswelopele Production company. The show is the longest-running lifestyle programme in South Africa, broadcasting since 1996. In addition to a variety of presenters, there is a voice-over guide throughout the programme. A magazine of the same name was launched in March 2004, containing similar content to the show. ==Content== The weekly show genres in beauty, fashion, food, home decor, travel and weddings. Different local and international celebrities are interviewed each week and a designer home is featured as part of the show. International celebrities such as Donald Trump's ex wife, Ivana Trump, have been featured on the show, as well as Hollywood actor and Beverly Hills doctor, Dr. Rey. Local celebrities such as rugby player Bryan Habana, singer Tamara Dey and Muvhango actress Ntahbiseng Mphahlele have been given equal attention. Popular events such as awards ceremonies and fashion runway shows are showcased. Presenters travel to locations around the world and often partake in exclusive activities such as sky-diving, skiing, and scuba-diving. Food and wine pairings are also presented, and exclusive weddings are attended. In 2019 the broadcaster cancelled the show, as they could no longer afford to produce the show. The last episode was aired on 19 October 2019. ==Presenters== * Nico Panagio * Maps Maponyane * Jade Hubner * Lorna Maseko * Jeannie D * Ayanda Thabethe * Jonathan Boynton Lee * Ryle de Morny * Fezile Mkhize * Harmony Katulondi ===Past presenters=== *Basetsana Khumalo * Jo-Ann Strauss * Christopher Jaftha *Tumisho Masha *Neil McCarthy *Kelly Parkhurst *Lyndall Jarvis *Casey B Dolan *Vanessa Haywood *Roxy Burger *Natalie Becker *Simba Mhere (deceased) *Sinazo Cynthia Mini *Janez Vermeiren *Ursula Chikane *Aidan Bennetts *Bonang Matheba *Michael Mol *Dhiveja Sundrum ===Voice-over artists=== *Alex Jay *Kevin Savage *Phil Wright ==Public opinion== Janez Vermeiren, South African model and Top Billing presenter People who dislike Top Billing base their hostility on the \"questionable ethics\" that \"dressed presenters will sit down alone to a meal prepared for them in a luxurious setting. This is in a country where people are going hungry...\" Others complain that the content featured in the lifestyle programme are unaffordable to the average viewer. On the contrary, Top Billing producers affirm that the programme is aimed at \"giving South Africans hopes\" that they too can achieve those luxuries that they see on the programme. ==Tswelopele Productions== Tswelopele Productions is a production company equally owned by Basetsana Kumalo and Patience Stevens.http://www.topbilling.co.za/contact-us/tswelopele- productions.html|accessdate=14 April 2011 After the success of Top Billing, Tswelopele has starting producing additional local productions such as Afrikaans lifestyle programme Pasella, SiSwati youth show Ses'khona, travel series Top Travel, Top Dogs and No Reservations. ===Controversy=== In 2009, Tswelopele staff members suffered a 10% wage cut for 7 months after Tswelopele waited for SABC to renew their contract. This was accompanied by an 8-day late salary payment, after the company had apparently spent R400 000 expanding their working premises. In 2017, Tswelopele faced additional controversy when the broadcaster was unable to pay not only Tswelopele but several South African production companies that produced their content. Which resulted in salaries being paid late. An article published by ZAlebs stated that the presenters had also not been paid. ==Competition== In 2009, M-Net launched a lifestyle programme that was similar in content to that of Top Billing. The M-Net show, All Access, was given the same time slot as Top Billing. Lani Lombard, M-Net's publicist, was reported saying that the show will be \"fun- filled, unpretentious and we trust that many M-net viewers who have been watching Top Billing over the years will migrate to All Access\". Five seasons of the show were aired on M-Net before it was moved to one of M-Net's sister channels, Mzanzi Magic.http://www.tvsa.co.za/showinfo.asp?showid=3577 ==References== ==External links== * http://www.topbilling.co.za *http://www.tswelopele-sa.org.za *http://www.sabc3.co.za Category:1996 South African television series debuts Category:SABC 3 original programming Category:1990s travel television series Category:Wedding television shows Category:1990s South African television series Category:2000s travel television series Category:2000s South African television series Category:2010s travel television series Category:2010s South African television series ",
