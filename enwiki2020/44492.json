    "text": "National Park Service logo The National Park System of the United States is the collection of physical properties owned or administered by the National Park Service. The collection includes all national parks and most national monuments, as well as several other types of protected areas of the United States. As of September 2020, there are units of the National Park System. However, this number is somewhat misleading. For example, Denali National Park and Preserve is counted as two units, since the same name applies to a national park and an adjacent national preserve. Yet Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is counted as one unit, despite its double designation. Counting methodology is rooted in the language of a park's enabling legislation. In addition to areas of the National Park System, the National Park Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several affiliated areas authorized by Congress. Affiliated areas are marked on the lists below. The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which contains nearly 79,000 entries, is administered by the National Park Service. All historically significant park units are automatically included on the NRHP\u2014i.e., all national historical parks and historic sites, national battlefields and military parks, and national memorials, as well as some national monuments. National Park System units are found in all 50 states, in the District of Columbia, and in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in the National Park Passport Stamps program. ==National parks== ===Existing national parks=== There are 62 officially designated national parks in the United States and its dependent areas.
