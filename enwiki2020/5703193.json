Located on level 3, of Brisbane City Hall in the city's CBD, the Museum and its staff are highly regarded for their innovation and contemporary international practice across the museum and gallery sector. The recipient of a number of major awards during its brief history, the Museum has been twice been awarded the top honour at the prestigious Museums and Galleries National Awards as well as multiple Queensland Museum and Gallery Achievement Awards, Museums Australia Multimedia and Publications Design Awards and National Trust of Queensland Awards. ==History== Museum of Brisbane (MoB) was opened in October 2003 and occupied a space on the ground floor of City Hall. The museum replaced the Brisbane City Gallery which opened in 1977. In 2010, when City Hall closed for restoration, the Museum was relocated to Ann Street. On 6 April 2013 the Museum was reopened after returning to City Hall where it now occupies a purpose-built space on the building's third floor. Since its reopening the Museum has been an independent, not-for-profit arts organisation overseen by a board chaired by Sallyanne Atkinson. ==Collection== An exhibition about World Expo 88 The Museum manages the City of Brisbane Collection. The collection was created in 1859 when the Town of Brisbane (a local government area which preceded the City of Brisbane) was founded. It has grown to have more than 5,000 items including works by local artists and historical ceramics. ==Visiting== Museum of Brisbane is open every day from 10:00 to 17:00 and 10:00 to 19:00 on Fridays, except for New Year's Day, Good Friday, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, when it is closed, and Anzac Day, when it is open from 13:00 to 17:00.
