    "text": "The old Israeli shekel, then known as the shekel (, formally sheqel, . , Sheqalim; , \u0161ikal) was the currency of the State of Israel between 24 February 1980 and 31 December 1985. It was replaced by the Israeli new shekel at a ratio of 1000:1 on 1 January 1986. The old shekel was short-lived due to its hyperinflation. The old shekel was subdivided into 100 new agorot (). The shekel sign was 28px although it was more commonly denominated as S or IS. The Israeli old shekel replaced the Israeli pound, which had been used until 24 February 1980, at the rate of 1 shekel to 10 pounds. ==History== Development of a new currency to be known as the shekel (properly, sheqel) was approved by the Israeli Knesset on 4 June 1969. The governors of the Bank of Israel did not consider the time ripe until November 1977, when studies for its implementation began. Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Minister of Finance Simcha Erlich approved a proposal to redenominate the Israeli pound in May 1978; the proposal called for the currency to be exactly similar except for the removal of a zero from the inflated pound and agorot denominations.. The shekel and new agora became legal tender on 22 February 1980 and went into circulation two days later. Initial denominations were IS 1, 5, 10, and 50, but over the next five years inflation led to another five: IS 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10 000. New coin and bill designs were selected through competitions among graphic designers.. Beginning with the IS 500 issue, the size of the notes was standardized () and the denominations differentiated by color and design. A transparent part was added to discourage counterfeiting and elements for the blind were added. The new Israeli shekel replaced the shekel following its hyperinflation and the enactment of the economic stabilization plan of 1985 which brought inflation under control. It became the currency of Israel on 4 September 1985, removing three zeros from the old notes.. The old shekel is no longer in circulation, has been demonetized, and is not exchangeable to current legal tender by the Bank of Israel. ==Coins== The initial series of coins in 1980 were for the denominations of 1, 5, and 10 new agorot and . These preserved the appearance of the similar coins under the pound but were worth 10 times as much. The initial runs were struck at foreign mints in order to preserve the secrecy of the coming currency conversion. coins were introduced in 1981; and 10 coins in 1982; and and 100 coins in 1984. The 1 and 5 new agorot coins were aluminum; the 10 new agorot and , 1, and 100 coins cupronickel; the and 50 coins an alloy of copper, aluminum, and nickel; and the cupro-aluminum. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" |+Old shekel coins |- !rowspan=2| Image !! rowspan=2| Value !! colspan=\"3\" | Technical parameters ! colspan=\"2\" |Description!! colspan=\"2\" | Date of |- !
