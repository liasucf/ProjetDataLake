    "text": "Scroll of the Psalms Psalm 114 is the 114th psalm of the Book of Psalms. In the Greek Septuagint version of the bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 113 in a slightly different numbering system. ==Structure and theme== The Hebrew people leaving Egypt, led by Moses, on a mural in the synagogue of Doura Europos, in Syria. The Psalm is composed of four stanzas of two lines, which the word Jacob envelops. The two central stanzas evoke with images full of life the miracle of the Red Sea and the passage of the Jordan. God is evoked only at the end of the Psalm, doubtless to arouse the expectation. The first stanza recalls by the verb that the Hebrew people are born in the exodus. The words sanctuary and domain designate the entire Holy Land, the inheritance of God, not only in the geographical sense but also in a spiritual sense. The miracles that allow Israel to cross the Red Sea and cross the Jordan River are poetically enhanced by the process of hyperbole and by images evoking a life of natural elements, water and mountains. It is a means of manifesting all creation with Israel and actively participating in its march towards the Promised Land. At eight verses the psalm is comparatively concise. Psalm 114 begins with the Hebrew '\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e6\u05b5\u05d0\u05ea \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, \u05de\u05b4\u05de\u05b4\u05bc\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd; \u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b9\u05d1, \u05de\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7\u05dd \u05dc\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05d6' and in Hebrew is an acrostic Poem.
