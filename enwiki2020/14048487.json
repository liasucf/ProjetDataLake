    "text": "Making Out is a series of young adult novels by authors K. A. Applegate and Michael Grant. The series was formerly known as \"Boyfriends/Girlfriends\" and the first eight books were republished in 2015 as The Islanders. The books were based on the lives of teenagers living on an island called Chatham Island off the coast of Maine. The main characters were Zoey Passmore and her brother Benjamin, Claire Geiger and her sister Nina, Jake McRoyan, Lucas Cabral, and Aisha Gray. Later in the series, new characters were introduced. The books dealt with several difficult topics (such as the death of a parent, molestation, divorce, disability, drugs, and alcohol) and followed the effect of these issues on the character's lives. The books followed the group of teenagers from their senior year in high school to life in college. The series was published in German with an additional, 29th book.https://www.amazon.de/Nina-hoffnungslos-romantisch-Katherine- Applegate/dp/340105869X Books from the series have also been translated into Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, French, Greek, Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Thai.https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/1031271-zoey-fools- aroundhttps://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q;=Zoey+Fools+Aroundhttp://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&stxt;=Jake+Finds+Out&sl;=&l;=&c;=&pla;=&pub;=&tr;=&e;=&udc;=&d;=&from;=&to;=&tie;=ahttp://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&stxt;=Nina+Won%27t+Tell&sl;=&l;=&c;=&pla;=&pub;=&tr;=&e;=&udc;=&d;=&from;=&to;=&tie;=a ==List of books== There are 28 books in the whole series, but only the first eight books were written by Katherine Applegate.
