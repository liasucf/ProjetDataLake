She had previously traveled to visit Booker T. Washington (d. 1915), and she attended his lectures in Tuskegee, Alabama, in the fall of 1901. She was also very moved by her experiences with Jim Crow laws in the South, as well as by Washington's lectures. As a result, Abby Hill named the mountain in honor of Booker T. Washington. ==Climbing history== The first ascent of the Northeast face of Mt. Booker was completed by Dan Davis and John Holland on August 22, 1964 Booker Mountain from Sahale Arm ==References== Category:Mountains of Washington (state) Category:Mountains of Chelan County, Washington Category:Booker T.
