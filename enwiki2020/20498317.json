Confederate forces under the command of Lt. Gen. Jubal Early constructed the roughly square earthen fort in June 1864 as part of the outer defenses of Lynchburg as the Union Army of West Virginia, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter, advanced from the north and west in an attempt to capture the city during the Battle of Lynchburg. It is the only section of the Lynchburg defenses still in existence. and Accompanying photo The walls of the fort are approximately 12 to in height on the exterior and approximately 4 to high on the interior. Within the fort is a one-story brick structure that was built in 1922 by the Fort Hill Woman's Club and contains exhibits on the Battle of Lynchburg. A brick paved entrance drive with a high iron arch erected in 1924, with the words \"Fort Early\", cut through the eastern portion of the breastworks and forms the entrance to the site. The remaining portions of the breastworks are intact including a sally port in the northern wall used to bring in ammunition and other supplies during the military operation of the fort. A high granite obelisk honoring Confederate General Jubal A. Early and erected in 1919, is located on a triangle of land formed by the intersection of Fort Avenue and Memorial Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. ==Gallery== Image:Fort Early Arch Nov 08.JPG|Fort Early Entrance Arch, Lynchburg VA, November 2008 Image:Fort Early Clubhouse Nov 08.JPG|Fort Hill Woman's Club Clubhouse, Lynchburg VA, November 2008 Image:Early Monument Inscription Nov 08.JPG|Inscription on the Jubal Early Monument, Lynchburg VA, November 2008 Image:Battle of Lynchburg Map Nov 08.JPG|Map of the Battle of Lynchburg, Lynchburg VA, November 2008 ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Early Category:Neoclassical architecture in Virginia Category:Obelisks in the United States Category:Monuments and memorials in Virginia Category:1919 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures in Lynchburg, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lynchburg, Virginia Early Category:Granite sculptures in Virginia Category:Confederate States of America monuments and memorials in Virginia Category:Jubal A.
