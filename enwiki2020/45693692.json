While admirers of his more jazz oriented work might find the music here daunting indeed, it repays careful listening and also strikes one as a seminal work that prefigures many of the concerns he would deal with later on in his collage- form structures written for his classic quartet of the '80s and '90s\".Olewnick, B., Allmusic Review accessed March 17, 2015 ==Track listing== All compositions by Anthony Braxton. # \"Composition 76: Version I\" - 20:56 # \"Composition 76: Version II\" - 20:22 ==Personnel== *Anthony Braxton - piccolo, flute, soprano clarinet, clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, contrabass saxophone, tragata, gongs, percussion, little instruments *Henry Threadgill - flute, bass flute, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, clarinet, Hub \"T\" Wall, gongs, percussion, little instruments (track 1) *Douglas Ewart - piccolo, flute, soprano clarinet, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano saxophones, alto saxophone, bassoon, Ewartphone, gongs, percussion, little instruments (track 1) *Roscoe Mitchell - piccolo, flute, clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, bass saxophone, gongs, percussion, little instruments (track 2) *Joseph Jarman - flute, clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, bass saxophone, vibraphone, gongs, percussion, little instruments (track 2) ==References== Category:Arista Records albums Category:Anthony Braxton albums Category:1978 albums Category:Albums produced by Michael Cuscuna ",
