Theological education for Swedish immigrants was first assumed by the Swedish department of the Chicago Theological Seminary, but soon the Covenant wanted a school its own. In 1891, the Covenant established a school in Minneapolis; three years later, this school was moved to its present location in Chicago. A view of the heart of North Park's campus The seminary shares a campus with North Park University, the denomination's liberal arts college. The seminary's main building, Nyvall Hall, is named after David Nyvall, who was instrumental in the formation of the school and served as professor and president for many years. Though retaining some of its Swedish roots, North Park Theological Seminary is now a multi-ethnic institution that fully supports women in ministry. A majority of students study at North Park to serve ministries of the Evangelical Covenant Church, but the student body includes representatives from various Protestant Christian denominations. ==Notable alumni and faculty== * Klyne Snodgrass, New Testament scholar and author * Timothy Johnson, medical journalist ==References== ==External links== * North Park Theological Seminary official website * Evangelical Covenant Church Category:Evangelicalism in Illinois Category:Evangelical seminaries and theological colleges Category:Seminaries and theological colleges in Illinois Category:Universities and colleges affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church ",
