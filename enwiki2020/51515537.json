The 30th Army Division()(2nd Formation) was formed in July 1968 in Huhhot, Inner Mongolia from 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Independent Infantry Regiment of Inner Mongolian Military District. In December 1969 all regiments of the division was re- designated as follows: *88th Infantry Regiment; *89th Infantry Regiment; *90th Infantry Regiment; *Artillery Regiment. In January 1979, for the preparation of presumed Soviet aggressive actions following the Sino-Vietnamese War, the division was re-organized and renamed as 6th Garrison Division of Beijing Military Region(). In 1985 the division absorbed 2 regiments from the disbanding 30th Army Division (3rd Formation). By then the division was composed of: *21st Garrison Regiment; *22nd Garrison Regiment; *23rd Garrison Regiment; *24th Garrison Regiment; *31st Garrison Regiment; *Artillery Regiment. In 1992, 6th Garrison Division was reduced and renamed as 30th Infantry Brigade(), the first infantry brigade organized under Chinese military re-form. In 1998, the brigade was inactivated and became 30th Reserve Infantry Division() of Inner Mongolian Military District. ==References== *\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u89e3\u653e\u519b\u5404\u6b65\u5175\u5e08\u6cbf\u9769\uff0chttp://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_a3f74a990101cp1q.html, which mistakenly confused the division with the 30th Army Division (3rd Formation). *\u5317\u4eac\u519b\u533a\u5b88\u5907\u7b2c6\u5e08 , http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_e402930d0101b7f1.html Category:Infantry divisions of the People's Liberation Army Category:Military units and formations established in 1968 ",
