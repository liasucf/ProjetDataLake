    "text": "Save Your Breath is an album by Canadian jazz pianist Kris Davis, which was recorded in 2014 and released on the Portuguese Clean Feed label. For this project, Davis assembled the band Infrasound, an unusual octet consisting of four bass clarinets, organ, guitar, drums and piano. She created the music on a commission from The Shifting Foundation. The album was recorded and mixed by rock engineer Ron Saint Germain.Save Your Breath at Clean Feed ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Dave Lynch says about Infrasoud that \"is a monster band capable of delivering a gargantuan punch.\" The Down Beat review by John Ephland notes that \"Whether it\u2019s the new-music classical vibe interfacing with the down-home sense of abandon or the sound of the instruments themselves and the novel assortment Davis has brought on board, Save Your Breath seems to have something for everyone.\"Ephland, John. Save Your Breath review. Down Beat August 15: page 91. Print. In a review for All About Jazz Glenn Astarita describes the album as \"a musical journey that may be akin to navigating through a dense forest via snaking trails, rolling hills and dusky caves.\"Astarita, Glenn.
