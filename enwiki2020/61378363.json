The flowers grow in clusters or singly in the axils of the leaves. They are unisexual, with male flowers being on a different tree from female flowers. They are yellowish-green and fragrant, and are followed by globular, fleshy fruit up to in diameter which turn orangish- red as they ripen. ==Distribution and habitat== Drypetes arguta is native to eastern Africa where its range extends from Tanzania and Zimbabwe, southwards to Mozambique, Swaziland, and South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape). It grows in forests and alongside water-courses, at altitudes of up to . It is also a major constituent of the flora of the Southern African Sand Forest, a habitat consisting of woodland growing on ancient sand dunes located on the border between southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal. ==Uses== Sections of branches of this tree have traditionally been used in hut construction, and the wood has also been used to make sticks. The fruits are edible and have been used to make a fermented alcoholic drink. ==References== Category:Drypetes Category:Flora of South Africa Category:Trees of Africa Category:Plants described in 1866 ",
