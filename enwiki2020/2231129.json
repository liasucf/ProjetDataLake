    "text": "A labial\u2013coronal consonant is a consonant produced with two simultaneous articulators: With the lips ('labial'; a , , or sound), and with the tongue (at the gums, an 'alveolar' , , or sound, or further back, a 'post-alveolar' , sound). Several languages have been claimed to have such sounds, such as Margi and Bura in Nigeria. However, most researchers interpret them as having sequences of labial and coronal consonants, a rather common occurrence in Africa. The Y\u00e9l\u00ee Dnye language of Rossel Island, Papua New Guinea, appears to be unique in having distinct labial\u2013alveolar and labial\u2013postalveolar places of articulation, as illustrated below. (The alveolars are fronted, and the post- alveolars only slightly retracted, so it may be best not to consider the latter to be retroflex as they are sometimes described.) {| class=\"wikitable\" font-size:larger;\" |- style=\"vertical-align: center; font-size: small; height: 2em\" !

These are sometimes mistakenly referred to as labial\u2013alveolars, though they actually have a post-alveolar or palatal articulation instead of a true alveolar one. Something similar is found with the labialized alveolar stops in several Northwest and Northeast Caucasian languages such as Abkhaz and Lak. Although the double stop articulation may be more common, they are generally considered to be essentially labialized alveolars because the labial contact is light, and moreover the contact is between the inner surfaces of the lips, which are protruded as they are for [w]. This is quite different from the normal contact for [p] in these languages. The labial contact may also be realized as a trill. Compare the following minimal sets in Ubykh: {| class=wikitable |||now||||awl||||if |- |||pregnant||||cherry||||to weave |- |||ram||||to take out|| || |} Some speakers of !X\u00f3\u00f5 have a labial\u2013dental allophone, (or ), of the bilabial click in some cases (Traill 1985: 103\u2013104). Discounting clicks otherwise as having a velar/lingual airstream mechanism rather than a double articulation, nearly all other doubly articulated consonants in the world are labial\u2013velars. The labial-alveolars reported from some Chadic languages have upon investigation turned out to be , , and sequences, not single consonants.
