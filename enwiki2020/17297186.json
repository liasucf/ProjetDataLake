A great number of artefacts from the stone, copper and bronze ages can be found in different local collections and in the Hungarian National Museum. According to inscribed stones from the Roman era, noble inhabitants of Aquincum liked and used the water of F\u0151k\u00fat (the main apring), building up a spa around it and developing local plots of ground as a medium category farm. The name of the village was first mentioned in a deed of gift issued in 1286 on the 5th Sunday after Fig Sunday. After the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1526) Hungary was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, but in P\u00e1ty the local population remained (except for some longer or shorter periods) unlike other villages in this part. The competence and industry of the local people in agriculture had a very important role in the survival of the village. Merchants of far countries came here regularly for steely wheat and smooth wine. Onion, fresh cherries, cheese and cottage cheese were sold in the market of Buda mainly. The wine culture and production of the village was lost in the great 19th century European phylloxera epidemic, but the cellars of the old growers still have a fantastic atmosphere. The village was devastated in the \"Wildkansas\" tornado of 13 June 1924. == Sights == Csergez\u00e1n P\u00e1l-viewpoint View from Mine Hilltop * V\u00e1rady-castle * Reformed Church * I. and II.
