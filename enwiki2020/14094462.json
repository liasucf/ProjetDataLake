    "text": "In geometry of higher dimensions, a hypersphere is the set of points at a constant distance from a given point called its centre. It is a manifold of codimension one\u2014that is, with one dimension less than that of the ambient space. As the hypersphere's radius increases, its curvature decreases. In the limit, a hypersphere approaches the zero curvature of a hyperplane. Hyperplanes and hyperspheres are examples of hypersurfaces. The term hypersphere was introduced by Duncan Sommerville in his 1914 discussion of models for non-Euclidean geometry.Duncan Sommerville (1914) Elements of Non- Euclidean Geometry, page 193 via Internet Archive The first one mentioned is a 3-sphere in four dimensions. Some spheres are not hyperspheres: If S is a sphere in Em where , and the space has n dimensions, then S is not a hypersphere. Similarly, any n-sphere in a proper flat is not a hypersphere. For example, a circle is not a hypersphere in three-dimensional space, but it is a hypersphere in the plane. ==References== ==Further reading== * Kazuyuki Enomoto (2013) Review of an article in International Electronic Journal of Geometry. * Jemal Guven (2013) \"Confining spheres in hyperspheres\", Journal of Physics A 46:135201, Category:Multi-dimensional geometry ",
