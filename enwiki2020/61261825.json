    "text": "Melting Me Softly () is a 2019 South Korean television series starring Ji Chang-wook, Won Jin-ah and Yoon Se-ah. Created by Studio Dragon and produced by writer Baek Mi-kyung's own company Story Phoenix, it aired on tvN every Saturday and Sunday at 21:00 (KST) from September 28 to November 17, 2019. ==Synopsis== Ma Dong-chan (Ji Chang-wook) and Ko Mi-ran (Won Jin-ah) take part in a 24-hour experiment where both are frozen. Things don't go as expected and they wake up from the frozen capsule 20 years later instead of 24 hours. In order to survive the side effects of their cryogenic sleep, they must follow a set of restrictions to maintain their body temperature at 31.5\u00b0C (max. 33\u00b0C/88-91\u00b0F) and keep their heart rate normal. The scientist behind the experiment is the only one who knows the key to their survival but he has lost his memory after an accident. Racing against time, the story focuses on two dynamic individuals' attempt to resume normalcy and catch up on the lost time of their lives. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Ji Chang-wook as Ma Dong-chan (32/52) * Won Jin-ah as Go Mi-ran (24/44) * Yoon Se-ah as Na Ha-yeong (44) ** Chae Seo- jin as young Ha-yeong (24) Dong-chan's girlfriend ===Supporting=== ====People around Dong-chan==== * Yoon Seok-hwa as Kim Won-jo, Dong-chan's mother (55/75) * Kim Won-hae as Ma Pil-gu, Dong-chan's father (59) * Kang Ki-doong as Ma Dong-sik (29), Dong-chan's younger brother ** Kim Won-hae as old Dong-sik (49) * Han Da-sol as Ma Dong-joo (30), Dong-chan's younger sister ** Jeon Soo-kyung as old Dong-joo (50) * Lee Do-gyeom as Baek Young-tak (35), Dong-joo's ex- husband, a police detective. ** Lee Do-yeob as old Young-tak (55) * Lee Joo- young as Lee Hye-Jin, Dong-sik's wife * Oh Ah-rin as Ma Seo-yoon (7), Dong- sik's daughter ====People around Mi-ran==== * Gil Hae-yeon as Mi-ran's mother (46/66) * Park Choong-sun as Mi-ran's father (45/65) * Park Min-soo as Go Nam- tae (12) ** Yoon Na-moo as adult Nam-tae (32), Mi-ran's brother ====People at the broadcast station==== * Im Won-hee as Son Hyeon-gi (48) ** Lee Hong-gi as young Son Hyeon-gi (28) *Jung Hae-kyun as Kim Hong-seok (41/61) * Han Jae-i as producer Su * Hong Seo-baek as producer Lee ====People at the campus==== * Cha Sun-woo as Hwang Byung-shim (24), Mi-ran's ex-boyfriend ** Shim Hyung-tak as old Byung-shim (44) * Song Ji-eun as Oh Young-seon (24) Mi-ran's best friend, who married Byung-shim ** Seo Jeong-yeon as old Young-seon (44) * Oh Ha-nee as Park Kyung-ja (24) Mi-ran's other best friend. ** Park Hee-jin as old Kyung-ja (44) * Choi Bo-min as Hwang Ji-hoon (19), Hwang Byung-Shim and Young-sun's son, a freshman at Korea University who develops a crush on Mi-ran. * Kang Yoo-seok as Park Young-joon (19) Ji-hoon's best friend, a freshman at Korea University. ====Others==== * Seo Hyung-chul as Hwang Gab-soo (46/66) * Lee Moo-saeng as Jo Ki-beom (45) ** Kim Wook as young Ki-beom (25) * Kim Bup-rae as Lee Hyung-do/Lee Seok-do ===Special appearances=== * Tony An (Ep. 1) * Kim Soo-ro (Ep. 6) * Ra Mi-ran (Ep. 6) * Park Jin-young as Jang Woo-shin (Ep.14) ==Production== ===Development=== Won Jin-ah and Yoon Se-ah have previously starred together in Rain or Shine (2017).
