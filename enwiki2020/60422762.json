Tichy is perhaps best known for his association with the Pennsylvania Railroad, for which he created the infamous \u201cClamshell\u201d, an aluminum and steel canopy over the electronic ticketing area, in Penn Station\u2019s Main Waiting Room in New York City. Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d is largely seen as a harbinger of the station's ultimate demolition, and stands for the lost landmark's final decline. ==Early Life== Born in 1905, Tichy studied at Columbia University in Upper Manhattan. After graduation, Tichy toured Europe and began working under John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial. Though Pope's firm was working on a number of notable Washington, D.C. structures at the time, Tichy ultimately opted to strike out on his own. Free of Pope's Beaux-Arts shackles, Tichy hung up his shingle as a distinctively modern architect. ==Career== left Dubbed a \u201c[n]oted [a]rchitect\u201d by 1956, Tichy ultimately left his mark on homes, railroad stations, dormitories, and even the paint schemes of Long Island Rail Road trains over the course of a long and varied career. Tichy was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Raymond Loewy, another venerable Pennsylvania Railroad designer. Like Loewy, Tichy proceeded to design a wide range of structures for the Pennsylvania across its sprawling system. At Aberdeen, Tichy designed a compact, streamlined station with Machine Age details. At Enola, Tichy created a dormitory that provided \u201cneat,\u201d \u201cquiet,\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d accommodations for Railroad men in need of a place to retire after long freight runs. Another Tichy dorm at Harrisburg offered \u201cbig, full-height, corrugated-glass\u201d windows in keeping with the \u201cprogressive\u201d tastes of the times. And between 1949 and 1955, Tichy designed modern paint schemes for the Long Island Rail Road, a Pennsylvania subsidiary. Tichy's modernist sensibilities were not confined to the \u201cstandard railroad of the world.\u201dJohn A. Fostik, Amtrak Across America: An Illustrated History at p. 33. Throughout the middle of the 20th-century, Tichy designed flat-roofed structures that found critical acclaim in the publications of his time. In 1945, House & Garden recognized one of Tichy's telltale houses with a prize in its \u201cBlueprints for Tomorrow\u201d architectural contest. This newfound notoriety led to additional commissions, including a \u201cstreamlined metal and glass snack bar\u201d for La Guardia Airport in 1948. With Tichy's status cemented, acclaim flowed. In 1956, a LIFE Magazine advertiser heralded Tichy's designs in a full-page spread. \u201cTichy has brought summer fun and freedom indoors,\u201d the advertiser swooned. ==Penn Station and Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d== right Though Tichy's imprint appeared on a range of modern structures, he became best identified with his 1956 \u201cClamshell\u201d in Manhattan\u2019s original Penn Station. right By 1952, Tichy remained associated with the Pennsylvania Railroad, although he had left its employ. The Pennsylvania, confronting mounting passenger losses, contracted with Tichy to replace Penn Station's grand Savarin dining room with a series of two bowling alleys in an attempt to raise cash off its cavernous \u2013 but cash-bleeding \u2013 Manhattan facility. Throughout 1952, Tichy partnered with the Pennsylvania to develop revenue-generating concessions at Penn Station and air-rights sales over its adjacent rail yards. Tichy's new partnership with the Pennsylvania was a harbinger of things to come. In 1954, Tichy himself \u201cprepared plans for an orderly demolition\u201d of the beloved station, and began associating with real estate titans William Zeckendorf and Benjamin Swig. With the scent of redevelopment in the air, Tichy then began designing an airline-style ticket counter to satiate the Pennsylvania's desire to boost ticket sales and make money off its station. \u201cWhether desperately or cynically,\u201d wrote The New York Times, railroad executives \u201cseemed to understand that redevelopment of their money-losing, nine-acre station would be more palatable if the public could be made to forget the glories of Mr. McKim's original design.\u201d The result was a \u201cmodernistic, clamshell-shaped, sawtooth-edged, fluorescent-bathed ticket counter\u201d in the center of Penn Station's monumental \u2013 but, by then, soot- streaked and grimy \u2013 Main Waiting Room. Erected at a cost of $2 million, Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d housed a new-fangled electronic ticket center that was \u201csupposed to convince passengers that railroading was as modern as flying.\u201d \u201cThe glowing fluorescent curve under the soiled classical space was like a jet plane next to a grimy locomotive,\u201d wrote architectural historian Christopher Gray. Today, some remember Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d as a \u201cluminous,\u201d \u201csoaring,\u201d and \u201cswooping\u201d example of mid-century modern design. But to others, such as historian and sociologist Lewis Mumford, the \u201cClamshell\u201d was a \u201cgreat treason\u201d to Penn Station's design. Mumford speculated the Pennsylvania Railroad plopped Tichy's clamshell in the center of Penn Station's \u201cotherwise uninterrupted grand axi[s]\u201d to provide \u201cjustification\u201d for \u201cdestroying the station from the inside.\u201d The Railroad did ultimately demolish Penn Station in an \u201c[e]pic [a]ct of [c]ivic [v]andalism,\u201dhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly- standard/undoing-an-epic-act-of-civic-vandalism and many now agree Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d was \u201ca nail in the station's coffin\u201d and \u201cthe final insult to McKim, Mead & White\u2019s heroic 1910 station.\u201d Tichy \u201cbrutally raped\u201d the station, concluded architect B. Sumner Gruzen. ==Legacy== right Today, Tichy's \u201cClamshell\u201d is remembered as the first shot in the Pennsylvania Railroad's battle to destroy its own flagship station. Yet the modernist played a far more integral role in Penn Station's destruction than commonly thought. Architectural Forum described Tichy's early demolition plans as \u201chow to turn a monument into cash,\u201d and heralded his three-stage scheme for \u201cshrinking the glory to fatten the revenue.\u201d After a series of starts and stops, the Pennsylvania Railroad did eventually refine and deploy Tichy's demolition and redevelopment concept to destroy the original Penn Station and construct Madison Square Garden on top.Peter Moore, The Destruction of Penn Station (2001) Thus, every time a railroad passenger \u201cscuttles\u201d into today's Penn Station \u201clike a rat,\u201d they have, in part, architect Lester C. Tichy to thank. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1981 deaths ",
