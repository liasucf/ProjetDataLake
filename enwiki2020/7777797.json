It is known for providing both news and analysis, along with explanatory and investigative journalism across a range of digital, print, and broadcast platforms as well as through live and virtual events. It is owned by Editorial Projects in Education (EPE), a nonprofit organization, whose mission is to raise awareness and understanding of critical issues facing American schools. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland in Greater Washington DC. The newspaper publishes 37 issues a year, including three special annual reports (Quality Counts, Technology Counts, and Leaders to Learn From). Other in-depth coverage includes regular, deep-dive topical reports on subjects like personalized learning, teacher recruitment, and assessment. == History == In 1957, Corbin Gwaltney, founder and then editor of Johns Hopkins Magazine for alumni of Johns Hopkins University, and a group of other university alumni magazine editors came together to discuss writing on higher education and decided to form Editorial Projects for Education (EPE), a nonprofit educational organization. Soon after, Gwaltney left Johns Hopkins Magazine to become the first full-time employee of the newly created EPE, starting in an office in his apartment in Baltimore and later moving to an office near the Johns Hopkins campus. He realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication. Gwaltney and other board members of EPE met to plan a new publication. In 1966, EPE published the first issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education.Viadero, Debra, Education Week: \"A Media Organization With Many Faces\". Education Week, September 6, 2006 In 1978, EPE sold Chronicle to its editors and shifted its attention. With the support of several philanthropies, and using the successful model of Chronicle, EPE went on to launch Education Week under the leadership of Ronald A. Wolk. The first issue of Education Week appeared on Sept. 7, 1981, and sought to provide Chronicle-like coverage of elementary and secondary education. It launched with a splash by running a scoophttp://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1981/09/07/01010004.h01.html about efforts by President Ronald Reagan's administration to downgrade the U.S. Department of Education, which was then still in its infancy.https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/04/29/ronald-a-wolk-education- week-founder-who.html In August 1981, EPE officially changed the name to Editorial Projects in Education.
