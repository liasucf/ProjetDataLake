    "text": "A Stranger Came to the Farm () is a 1937 novel by the Finnish writer Mika Waltari. It tells the tragic story of a farming couple where the husband is an alcohol abuser. ==Publication== The book was published in Finnish by WSOY in 1937. It appeared in English in 1952, translated by Naomi Walford and published by Putnam. ==Reception== Edmund Fuller of Saturday Review wrote that the book > is effective, striking, in many ways. Yet in spite of the sparseness and > compactness of the book [Waltari] manages to make it almost lush, or purple, > in some of its passages. It is good of its kind, but I am afraid it is more > of an interesting item in relation to Waltari's body of work than an > enhancement of his reputation. ==Adaptations== The book has been adapted for film twice, in 1938 by Wilho Ilmari as Vieras mies tuli taloon and in 1957 by Hannu Leminen as The Stranger. ==References== Category:1937 novels Category:20th-century Finnish novels Category:Finnish-language novels Category:Finnish novels adapted into films Category:Novels by Mika Waltari ",
