On 14 March 2017, Parrikar was sworn in as Chief Minister of Goa. Goa Forward Party led by Vijai Sardesai, one of the parties who allied with BJP in Goa after election results were announced, had said that it would extend support to the BJP only if Parrikar was brought back to the state as Chief Minister. ===Union Minister for Defence (201417)=== Parrikar interacting with the media after taking charge as the Defense Minister, in New Delhi on 10 November 2014.
