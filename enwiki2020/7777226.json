    "text": "Erotic Poetry, released in 1991, is the first extended play (EP) album by Esham A. Smith. It followed his 1989 LP album Boomin' Words from Hell, as his second release overall. Much like Boomin' Words from Hell an earlier version was released including alternative artwork and instrumentals, however it was released in limited numbers and is considered a collector's item by Esham fans.EshamErotic Poetry ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1991 EPs Category:Albums produced by Esham Category:Albums produced by Mike E.
