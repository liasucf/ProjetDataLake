As foreign minister, Okada was one of the chief participants in negotiations with the United States (US) over the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa. The Foreign Ministry under Okada also confirmed the existence of a long-rumored secret pact between Japan and US which had allowed the US military to carry nuclear weapons into Japanese territory in contravention of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. The previous administration under the LDP had denied that such a pact existed. In a September 2010 cabinet reshuffle, Okada was moved from foreign minister to secretary general of the DPJ. Okada, who is viewed as an intraparty ally of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, is believed to have been given the role of secretary general in order to secure Kan's influence in the governing party, as well as to help force the passage of government bills in parliament. Okada ran in the DPJ leadership election held in January 2015 after former president Banri Kaieda resigned after losing his seat. Okada won and returned as DPJ leader after a period of nine years. In 2016, he remained as leader when the Democratic Party of Japan merged with the Japan Innovation Party to become the Democratic Party. Following the party's defeat at the House of Councillors election in July, he announced that he would not seek re-election as leader at the party's annual meeting in September. ==Other interests== Okada is said to be an avid collector of frog knick knacks, which decorate his office. ==References== ==External links== * for Okada |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:\u00c6on Group Category:Foreign ministers of Japan Category:Government ministers of Japan Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:People from Yokkaichi Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians Category:New Frontier Party (Japan) politicians Category:20th- century Japanese politicians Category:Sun Party politicians Category:Good Governance Party politicians Category:Democratic Party of Japan politicians Category:Noda cabinet Category:University of Tokyo alumni Category:21st- century Japanese politicians ",
