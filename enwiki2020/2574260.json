Jacobsen's brother, Col Joye, was on the Long Way To The Top tour, as well as Lucky Starr, Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, Little Pattie, The Masters Apprentices, Stevie Wright, Daddy Cool, Normie Rowe, The Atlantics, John Paul Young, Dinah Lee and Marcia Hines. The tour proved to be successful, taking receipts of $10 million with a budget of $4.5 million.Billboard 10 May 2002, Vol. 114 Issue 40, p20 The ABC broadcast, highlights of the tour and subsequent CD and DVD packages went on sale. The concert tour was a unique event, in that the line-up had not toured together before, and would not do so again. Ross Wilson said: \"It was personally a buzz for me, meeting up with some of those '50s guys like Col Joye. Backstage everyone knew they were part of something momentous, because that entire lineup would never come together again. I think the audience got that vibe, too.\". ==References== == External links == * archived from the original on 1 October 2002.
