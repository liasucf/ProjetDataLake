She has released five albums and three EPs. She has written songs for other artists including Cher, Rihanna, the Backstreet Boys, Leona Lewis, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, C\u00e9line Dion and Christina Aguilera. ==History== ===Early life and career=== LP Pergolizzi was born in 1981 on Long Island, to an Italian father and an Irish mother, her paternal grandfather coming from Naples and grandmother from Palermo, Italy. Pergolizzi adopted the stage name \"LP\" after moving to New York City. David Lowery of the band Cracker saw LP performing and featured her on \"Cinderella\", a hidden track on the band's 1998 album, Gentleman's Blues. Lowery followed up by producing LP's debut album Heart- Shaped Scar, released in 2001 through Koch Records. LP's second album, Suburban Sprawl & Alcohol, was released in June 2004 through Lightswitch Records. On the record, she collaborated with songwriter and music producer Linda Perry. However, in spite of extensive touring to promote the release and positive reviews from music critics, the album failed to gain widespread recognition. ===2006\u20132010=== In 2006, LP appeared at the music conference South by Southwest and reportedly sparked a bidding war amongst major music labels, eventually being signed by L.A. Reid to his Island Def Jam Music Group record label, part of the Universal Music Group. However, due to artistic differences LP left the contract. She signed with SoBe Entertainment in 2007, an independent record label, with the album tracks she had written at the major label. \"Love Will Keep You Up All Night\", one of the tracks she had written at Island Def Jam Music Group with Billy Mann, was released in late 2007 on the Backstreet Boys album, Unbreakable. LP wrote and performed \"Wasted\", from her album Suburban Sprawl & Alcohol, which was the theme song for a television show, South of Nowhere, on The N, currently known as TeenNick. MTV's The Hills also featured LP's song \"Damage Is Done\" in mid-2010, and it was released on iTunes. During 2009, LP started writing songs for other artists, including several songs which ended up on Heidi Montag's album, Superficial (Warner Music). LP co-wrote the single, \"More Is More\", as well as the album tracks, \"Twisted\", \"Hey Boy\" and \"Love It or Leave It\". She also co-wrote other tracks for and with Montag, such as the Cathy Dennis co- written, \"Look How I'm Doin'\", \"I Do This\" and \"Who's That Girl\". A song LP wrote with Alexander Kronlund, \"Standing Where You Left Me\", was released on Erik Hassle's debut UK album, Pieces (Roxy/EMI/Universal). LP moved to Los Angeles in 2010. ===2011\u20132012=== In August 2010, it was announced that LP had signed with RedOne's record label, 2101 Records. LP landed her first major breakthrough as a songwriter, co-writing Rihanna's song, \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, released on November 12, 2010, on Def Jam Recordings. \"Cheers\" features a vocal hook performed by LP (taken from Avril Lavigne's \"I'm with You\"). In a 2010 interview with MTV News, Rihanna said: \"I love that song (\"Cheers\"). That is one of my favorite songs on the album. It makes you feel like celebrating. It gives you a great feeling inside like you want to go out and have a drink. ... People can't wait for the weekend.\" LP's major label songwriting breakthroughs continued, as she co-wrote \"Beautiful People\", performed by Christina Aguilera. The song is featured on the Burlesque: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack album, which was released on November 22, 2010 through RCA Records. In June 2011, LP co-wrote \"Afraid to Sleep\", which was performed by NBC's The Voice finalist Vicci Martinez and reached #10 on the iTunes Top Singles Chart. In September 2011, LP signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records. Shortly after, \"Into the Wild\", written and performed by LP, was prominently used in a Citibank national television advertisement campaign. In April 2012, LP released her first major label album, Into the Wild: Live at EastWest Studios, a five-song live extended play, and started touring extensively including festivals such as SXSW, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Bumbershoot, Tropfest as well as Tokyo's Sonic Boom and London's Hyde Park. In 2012, she became the first female Martin Guitar ambassador. ===2013\u2013present=== LP at the Zelt-Musik-Festival 2018 in Freiburg, Germany In May 2012, LP was featured as the Artist of the Week in Vogue magazine.
