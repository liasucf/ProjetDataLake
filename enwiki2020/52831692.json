She lives in an East End bedsit with her best friend George Nowodny, a songwriter and Jewish refugee from Nazi-occupied Berlin. The two were introduced by Maggie's brother Bill (who is now dead.) However, what Maggie doesn't know is that George is gay and was her brother's lover. As a refugee and foreigner George struggles to find gainful employment and starts doing rent on the streets to make ends meet. Maggie's boyfriend, Tom, is a Black Market wide boy who fixes himself up as Maggie and George's agent. He manages to get them an audition at a new night club owned by Sir Frank Worthington-Blythe, a wealthy socialite who was invalided out of the RAF after being awarded for bravery. Sir Frank is also deeply closeted. The audition goes well and Sir Frank is impressed by Maggie's voice and George's satirical and saucy song writing talents. A successful new partnership begin and Maggie is transformed into the sexy, saucy and sassy \u2018Miss Nightingale\u2019 becoming London's brightest West End star. Sir Frank and George begin a secret love affair. As Miss Nightingale's success grows, the three decide they no longer need Tom. In his anger, and having discovered Sir Frank and George's secret, Tom soon turns to blackmail to get his revenge. At a time when homosexuality was illegal, Sir Frank will do almost anything to avoid discovery. == Productions == A chamber version of the musical premiered at the Lowry Studio in Salford, Greater Manchester in January 2011 before transferring to the King's Head Theatre in London for 4 weeks.
