The site's critical consensus is, \"Grim and graphic, Too Old to Die Young is stylish, but its languid story does little to justify its violent tendencies \u2013 though fans of Refn's may find enjoyment in its neon laden misery.\" Praise was directed at Refn's signature style and Teller's performance but criticisms were raised regarding the depiction of sexual violence and the treatment of female characters. For Collider, Gregory Ellwood wrote: \"It\u2019s dated and tired and Refn should have known better.\" Conversely, Eric Kohn of IndieWire offered praise of the series, writing: \"there\u2019s certainly some potential in Too Old to Die Young, at least for audiences who can appreciate aspects of Refn\u2019s dark style and punkish sensibility.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the episodes 4 out of a possible 5 stars, stating: \"Too Old To Die Young is macabre, and nauseating in many ways, but very well made and very watchable.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2010s American television miniseries Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Prime Video original programming Category:Television series by Amazon Studios Category:Works by Ed Brubaker ",
