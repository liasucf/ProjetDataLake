FMC Technologies, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 14, 2001. In 2008, FMC Technologies spun off its FoodTech and Airport businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company called JBT Corporation. In 2009, the company acquired Multi Phase Meters (MPM), a Norwegian technology company that provides advanced instrumentation for the oil industry. In 2014, FMC Technologies divested its Material Handling Products business to Syntron Material Handling, LLC, an affiliate of Levine Leichtman Capital Partners.

Its headquarters were located in northern Houston, Texas. In Norway there were about 3800 employees, working at locations in Kongsberg, Asker, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansund, Floro and Notodden.
