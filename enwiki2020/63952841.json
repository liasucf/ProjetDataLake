    "text": "Lasagna Cat is a web series created by Fatal Farm as a parody of the Garfield comic strips. The series was uploaded to YouTube and ran from November 9, 2007 to February 23, 2017. The series consists mainly of humorous live-action recreations of Garfield comics, as well as absurdist and dark humor. == Format == The majority of Lasagna Cat consists of live-action reenactments of Garfield, with each reenactment followed by an absurd \"interlude\" segment. Most of the series' videos are only a few minutes long, with the exception of \"07/27/1978\" and \"Sex Survey Results\", which are one and five hours long, respectively. The series exists mainly to criticize the original Garfield comics' style of humor and as a tribute to its creator, Jim Davis. == Reception == Lasagna Cat was well received, with reviewers praising its insight into Garfield and comedy in general. It has been seen as a part of the widespread trend of \"weird\" Garfield internet memes. A popular parody Twitter account was created in response to \"07/27/1978\", an hour-long episode (set to Philip Glass' score to the 1997 film Kundun) in which actor John Blyth Barrymore philosophically monologues about his adoration and obsession with a Garfield strip published on the titular date. Additionally, the series was cited as an inspiration in the creation of the Adult Swim short Too Many Cooks. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2008)=== ===Season 2 (2017)=== == References == == External links == * * Category:2000s YouTube series Category:Comedy web series Category:YouTube channels launched in 2007 Category:Garfield Category:2010s YouTube series Category:2007 web series debuts Category:2017 web series endings ",
