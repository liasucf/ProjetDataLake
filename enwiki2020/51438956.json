    "text": "Not So Stupid (French: Pas si b\u00eate) is a 1946 French comedy film directed by Andr\u00e9 Berthomieu and starring Bourvil, Suzy Carrier and Bernard Lancret.Pallister & Hottell p.232 In 1928 Berthomieu had made a silent film of the same name. This was Bourvil's first film; originally a musician and singer, he went on to become one of the great comic actors of French cinema. \"Pas si b\u00eate\" is a comedy about social differences and appearances. L\u00e9on M\u00e9nard (Bourvil), a farmer and an apparently simple man of the country, is invited to visit his uncle Henri M\u00e9nard (Albert Duvaleix), a prosperous industrialist. He encounters a number of people scheming to marry into the M\u00e9nard family for the sake of money. M\u00e9nard discovers and thwart the plots and manages to unite a young couple who truly are in love. The romantic comedy ends happily with a double marriage. Henri's daughter Nicole (Suzy Carrier) marries Didier (Bernard Lancret), and M\u00e9nard marries his new-found love Rosine (Jacqueline Beyrot). It turns out that L\u00e9on is \"not so stupid\" after all. The film's art direction was by Raymond N\u00e8gre. ==Cast== * Bourvil as L\u00e8on M\u00e9nard * Suzy Carrier as Nicole * Bernard Lancret as Didier * Yvette Andr\u00e9yor as Mademoiselle * Mona Goya as Gaby * Albert Duvaleix as Henri * Charles Bouillaud as Joseph * Gaston Mauger as Le p\u00e8re de l\u00e9on * Paul Faivre as Le notaire * Made Siam\u00e9 as La m\u00e8re m\u00e9nard * Jacqueline Beyrot as Rosine * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Muni\u00e9 * L\u00e9on Daubrel * Jean Gabert * Yves Deniaud as Antony * Jacques Louvigny as De bellemont == References == == Bibliography == * Janis L.
