Wilson spent most of the 2015\u201316 season in their under-18 team, making only three appearances in the under-21 team, all as a substitute. However, he was fast-tracked into the first team for their summer tour to Austria. He played his first senior game against Paris Saint-Germain and his first start against Torquay United. Wilson made his competitive debut in the EFL Cup first round away to Northampton Town on 23 August 2016, coming on in the 70th minute for fellow debutant Brendan Galloway. The game ended as a 2\u20132 draw which his team lost 4\u20133 on penalties. Five days after his debut, Wilson was named in West Brom's squad for their Premier League game against Middlesbrough at The Hawthorns. Had he come onto the pitch, he would have been the league's first player born in the 2000s. ====Exeter City loan==== Wilson joined Exeter City on loan for five months on the summer transfer deadline day. He did not make his league debut until 28 October, in a 1\u20131 draw at Mansfield Town. He was sent off on his debut for accumulating two yellow cards, being given his marching orders in the 93rd minute. ====Tranmere Rovers loan==== On 9 August 2019, Wilson joined Tranmere Rovers on loan until January 2020, making his debut the next day in a 2\u20130 loss to Portsmouth ===Forest Green Rovers=== Wilson signed permanently with Forest Green Rovers on a two-year deal on 8 July 2020. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|West Bromwich Albion |2016\u201317 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\" | Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0 |- |West Bromwich Albion U23/U21 |2016\u201317 |colspan=3|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||2||0 |- |Exeter City (loan) |2017\u201318 |League Two |19||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||22||1 |- |Walsall (loan) |2018\u201319 |League One |14||0||0||0||2||0||4||0||20||0 |- |Exeter City (loan) |2018\u201319 |League Two |17||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||17||0 |- !colspan=\"3\" | Career totals !50!!1!!1!!0!!3!!0!!8!!0!!62!!1 |} ==International career== Wilson has represented England at U16 and U17 level.
