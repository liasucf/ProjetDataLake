Bukalapak was founded in 2010 by Achmad Zaky with two of his college friends from Bandung Institute of Technology, Fajrin Rasyid and Nugroho Herucahyono.

The nickname \"Pelapak\" is a common term used to call the sellers in Bukalapak. Bukalapak is also well-known for its efforts to embrace its pelapak communities all over the Indonesia and then International, which uphold the values of cooperation, togetherness, honesty, and thirst for knowledge. In September 2019, Bukalapak confirmed that it has laid off hundreds of employees. The layoffs were the result of an adjustment in strategy and efficiency improvements.

The startup also shed some marketing roles because of overexpansion, but core functions like digital marketing remain unaffected. ==Finances== Less than a year after being founded, Bukalapak received an additional capital from Batavia Incubator (a merged company from Rebright Partners, led by Takeshi Ebihara from Japanese Incubator and Corfina Group).
