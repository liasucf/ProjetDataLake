This is an elongate catfish up to standard length. It has no unique morphological features and can be distinguished from its congeners by a combination of characters including a uniformly buff colouring with small dark spots over the whole body, pelvic fin margin distant from the urogenital opening and rounded caudal fin. ==References== * * iheringi Category:Fish of South America Category:Fish of Brazil Category:Fish described in 1917 Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil ",
