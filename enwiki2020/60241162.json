Although born in Rio de Janeiro, he has spent his political career representing S\u00e3o Paulo, having served as state representative from 2007 to 2011 and since 2014. ==Personal life== Carvalho is originally a lawyer, and is also a pastor of the neo- Pentecostal movement the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Carvalho has his own radio show titled \"Show da Cidadania\" or \"Show of Citizenship\". ==Political career== Carvalho voted in favor of the impeachment against then- president Dilma Rousseff. Carvalho voted in favor of the 2017 Brazilian labor reform, and would later back Rousseff's successor Michel Temer against a similar impeachment motion. In late 2016 Carvalho proposed a bill that would make polygamy illegal in Brazil. The same bill regarded marriage as solely between a man and a woman, and would in theory make infidelity and same-sex partnerships illegal. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian lawyers Category:Republicans (Brazil) politicians Category:Brazilian radio personalities Category:Brazilian Pentecostal pastors Category:Members of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from S\u00e3o Paulo ",
