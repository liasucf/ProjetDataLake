    "text": "East Camberwell railway station is located on the Lilydale and Belgrave lines in Victoria, Australia, serving the eastern Melbourne suburb of Camberwell. It opened on 14 May 1900, as the interchange station for the Deepdene Dasher service, which ran north along the Outer Circle line, that had opened in 1891.East Camberwell Vicsig Three platforms were provided, two high-level ones for trains on the Lilydale line, and a single low-level one for trains on the Outer Circle. Steps were provided between all platforms, to enable passengers to change between services. Between 1915 and 1922, a signal box at the Melbourne end was provided, to control the junction towards Riversdale (on today's Alamein line), as the three tracks though to Camberwell had been reduced to two, to allow the regrading works at Camberwell to proceed. The Deepdene Dasher service was withdrawn on 9 October 1927, and the northern section of the Outer Circle line closed on 6 September 1943, when goods services to East Kew station ended. The low level platform was removed after World War II. The platforms on the Lilydale line were rebuilt in 1964, when work to provide a third track between Camberwell and East Camberwell was carried out. The southern platform at East Camberwell was converted into an island platform. That track amplification work also removed the bridge that had carried the Lilydale line over the Outer Circle line. The third track was extended to Box Hill in 1971. The Edwardian timber station building on Platforms 1 & 2 was replaced with a brick structure in 1981, partly due to the perceived fire risk. However, it was destroyed by fire on 12 August 1986 and replaced with the current open canopy. A substation is located north-east of station, along with a former works depot. ==Platforms & services== East Camberwell has an island platform with two faces and a side platform. Both platforms are linked by an underpass. It is served by Metro Trains' Lilydale and Belgrave line trains.
