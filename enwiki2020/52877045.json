    "text": "Miriam Marealik Qiyuk (born 1933) is a Canadian Inuit artist. One of eight surviving children of artist Jessie Oonark, Qiyuk was born into the traditional nomadic lifestyle before moving to Baker Lake in her early twenties. She began creating wall-hangings and carvings in the early 1960s; she had to give up working with textile around 1980 due to an allergic reaction to wool. Her carvings often deal with the legend of Kiviuq and the bird-woman to whom he is married. Qiyuk is married to the artist Silas Qiyuk. Her work has been featured in numerous exhibitions both in Canada and in the United States. Qiyuk is one of a number of Oonark's children to become artists; others include Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, Nancy Pukingrnak, Peggy Qablunaaq Aittauq, Mary Yuusipik Singaqti, Josiah Nuilaalik, and William Noah. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian textile artists Category:Canadian women sculptors Category:Inuit textile artists Category:Inuit sculptors Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:20th-century Canadian women artists Category:21st- century Canadian sculptors Category:21st-century Canadian women artists Category:People from Baker Lake Category:Canadian Inuit women Category:Artists from Nunavut Category:Women textile artists Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Inuit from Nunavut ",
