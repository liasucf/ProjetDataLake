    "text": "Best of My Love is the third studio album by Australian singer Samantha Jade, released through Sony Music Australia on 20 April 2018. It is her second album of covers after her debut album Samantha Jade (2012). ==Background== On 10 January 2018, CEO of Sony Music Australia Denis Handlin confirmed that a concept album was due to be released by Jade later in 2018. In a press release on 22 February 2018, Jade announced the release of the album and stated that \u201cBest of My Love was such a fun record to make. I hope it reignites the passion for all disco lovers and helps tell the story of this exciting genre to a whole new audience that may not have experienced the lifestyle first- hand. It\u2019s such an honor to pay tribute to some of the most iconic divas such as Donna Summer, Cher and Diana Ross. I\u2019ve always been inspired by disco, soul funk and dance, particularly the female voices that emerged during this time.\u201d The same month, Jade discussed her inspiration behind the album with Sydney Morning Herald: \"I was really excited about this musical I had seen in London, Motown: The Musical, I don't know how many times I went back to see it,\" she says. \"I was so obsessed with the story of Diana Ross and I went away from it and listened to more of her music and loved it.\" ==Reception== David from auspOp said \"on first listen, the album doesn\u2019t throw in any surprises and comes across quite flat\", adding that \"on the majority of songs, things feel polished but a bit too mellow. That being said, when Samantha connects to a song and is given the ability to let loose, she hits a home run.\" David named \"I Feel Love\", \"Hot Stuff\" and original tracks \"Roller Skates\" and \"Let Me Love You\" as the best tracks on the album. Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine said \"the tracklist doesn't take too many chances... but Jade's voice \u2013 breezy and bright \u2013 is perfectly suited to the euphoric and exuberant sound. The album concludes with a couple of impressive originals.\" Haydon Benfield from Renowned for Sound said \"Over its fourteen tracks and forty-seven minutes, Best of My Love fails to do anything exciting and a bit more of an adventurous streak would have served Jade well.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 6 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 20 April 2018 | CD, digital download | Sony Music Australia | 19075837752 |} ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Samantha Jade albums Category:Sony Music Australia albums ",
