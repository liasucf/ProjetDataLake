    "text": "Workers' Youth Theatre, also known as TRAM (the Russian acronym for \"Teatr RAbochey Molodyozhi\") was a Soviet proletarian youth theatre of the late 1920s and early 1930s. It was established by Mikhail Sokolovsky in a converted cinema on Liteiny Prospekt, Leningrad. The theatre was run as a collective and produced agitprop pieces designed to educate and persuade. The group worked together with the Left Column, a German agitprop group active in Berlin. A number of the group moved to Moscow in 1931. Helmut Damerius led the two groups from 1931 to 1933.Biographical details, Helmut Damerius Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Retrieved December 2, 2011 Adrian Piotrovsky was the theatre's principle ideologue, and Dmitri Shostakovich composed some incidental music for a number of its productions.Frolova-Walker & Walker, p. 373 By 1930 the theatre was under attack, accused of \"formalism\" by its critics from among journalists and rival proletarian organizations.McBurney, p. 160 ==See also== * Blue Blouse ==Sources== * Bradby, David, and John McCormick. 1978.
