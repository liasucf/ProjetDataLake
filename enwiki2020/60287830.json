It was founded in the nineteenth century as an Eastern Orthodox village of Borispol by migrants from what is now central Ukraine. The original population gradually left; the village was resettled by ethnic Azeris from neighbouring villages and renamed S\u0259rk\u0259rli in 1992. The village forms part of the municipality of Yerg\u00fcc. An archaeological site (now known as S\u0259rk\u0259rt\u0259p\u0259) containing early-Bronze Age artifacts and an eighth- century burial site was discovered nearby.Q\u0259l\u0259m\u015fah \u0130drisov. \"Xa\u00e7maz toponiml\u0259ri\".
