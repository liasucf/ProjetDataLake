In \"Newsman's Privilege: An Issue of Press Freedom,\u201d Miller found that journalists often had little if any way to protect sources at the state level.Newsmen's Privilege Hearings, House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee No. 3, 1972, page 259. https://books.google.com/books?id=JgEkAQAAMAAJ&pg;=RA2-PA259&lpg;=RA2-PA259&dq;=july+1971+%22the+quill%22+miller&source;=bl&ots;=GehZhVW4GW&sig;=ACfU3U09bSJb7vOT_z_AiL8vdhkv_hvPiQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjbv_Ccv7zpAhWKc98KHcTXCbcQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q;=july%201971%20%22the%20quill%22%20miller&f;=false The article called for the establishment of a federal newsman's privilege act that would protect reporters in all states.

However, some four years after the 1967 passage of the legislation, formal FOIA appeals by journalists were rare. Miller's study showed that of 133 formal FOIA requests just 12 came from the media while most came from private attorneys and business interests.

In a speech before the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials in Jacksonville on April 7, 2006, he told the nation's real estate regulators: :\"If you look at the numbers you can see that for many buyers the pricing gamble has been a huge success during the past few years. Home values have risen substantially in most areas. The odds are overwhelming that if you bought in 2000 or before and sold in 2005 or thereabouts you made money. A lot of money. :\"But looming in the background is the potential for financial disaster that will impact home values nationwide, spur foreclosure rates to new highs and devalue insurance funds, pension holdings and investor accounts.
