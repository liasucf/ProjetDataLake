    "text": "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte () painted from 1884 to 1886, is Georges Seurat's most famous work. It is a leading example of pointillist technique, executed on a large canvas. Seurat's composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks of the River Seine. ==Background== George Seurat, Study for \"A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte\", 1884, oil on canvas, 70.5 x 104.1 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York In 1879 Georges Seurat enlisted as a soldier in the French army and was back home by 1880. Later, he ran a small painter's studio in Paris, and in 1883 showed his work publicly for the first time. The following year, Seurat began to work on La Grande Jatte and exhibited the painting in the spring of 1886 with the Impressionists.Janis Tomlinson, ed., Readings in Nineteenth- Century Art, 1996 With La Grande Jatte, Seurat was immediately acknowledged as the leader of a new and rebellious form of Impressionism called Neo- Impressionism.Petra ten-Doesschate Chu, Nineteenth-Century European Art, 2012 (3rd Edition) Seurat painted A Sunday Afternoon between May 1884 and March 1885, and from October 1885 to May 1886,H. Dorra and J. Rewald, Seurat, Paris, 1960, p. 156. focusing meticulously on the landscape of the park. He reworked the original and completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches. He sat in the park, creating numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form. He concentrated on issues of colour, light, and form. The painting is approximately 2 by 3 meters (7 by 10 feet) in size. Inspired by optical effects and perception inherent in the color theories of Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, Ogden Rood and others, Seurat adapted this scientific research to his painting.Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968, Library of Congress Card Catalogue Number: 68-16803 Seurat contrasted miniature dots or small brushstrokes of colors that when unified optically in the human eye were perceived as a single shade or hue. He believed that this form of painting, called Divisionism at the time (a term he preferred) but now known as Pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brushstrokes. The use of dots of almost uniform size came in the second year of his work on the painting, 1885\u201386. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago. La Grande Jatte The Island of la Grande Jatte is located at the very gates of Paris, lying in the Seine between Neuilly and Levallois-Perret, a short distance from where La D\u00e9fense business district currently stands. Although for many years it was an industrial site, it is today the site of a public garden and a housing development. When Seurat began the painting in 1884, the island was a bucolic retreat far from the urban center. The painting was first exhibited at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886, then in August 1886, dominating the second Salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884.Exhibition History Seurat was extremely disciplined, always serious, and private to the point of secretiveness\u2014for the most part, steering his own steady course. As a painter, he wanted to make a difference in the history of art and with La Grand Jatte, succeeded.Herbert, Robert L., Neil Harris, and Georges Seurat. Seurat and the making of La Grande Jatte. Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago in association with the University of California Press, 2004. Print. ==Interpretation== The left bank of working class Bathers at Asni\u00e8res (1884) mirrors the right bank of the bourgeoisie on La Grande Jatte. Seurat's painting was a mirror impression of his own painting, Bathers at Asni\u00e8res, completed shortly before, in 1884. Whereas the bathers in that earlier painting are doused in light, almost every figure on La Grande Jatte appears to be cast in shadow, either under trees or an umbrella, or from another person. For Parisians, Sunday was the day to escape the heat of the city and head for the shade of the trees and the cool breezes that came off the river. And at first glance, the viewer sees many different people relaxing in a park by the river. On the right, a fashionable couple, the woman with the sunshade and the man in his top hat, are on a stroll. On the left, another woman who is also well dressed extends her fishing pole over the water. There is a small man with the black hat and thin cane looking at the river, and a white dog with a brown head, a woman knitting, a man playing a horn, two soldiers standing at attention as the musician plays, and a woman hunched under an orange umbrella. Seurat also painted a man with a pipe, a woman under a parasol in a boat filled with rowers, and a couple admiring their infant child.Burleigh, Robert, Seurat and La Grande Jatte: connecting the dots, New York: H.N. Abrams in association with the Art Institute of Chicago, 2004. Print Some of the characters are doing curious things. The lady on the right side has a monkey on a leash. A lady on the left near the river bank is fishing. The area was known at the time as being a place to procure prostitutes among the bourgeoisie, a likely allusion of the otherwise odd \"fishing\" rod. In the painting's center stands a little girl dressed in white (who is not in a shadow), who stares directly at the viewer of the painting. This may be interpreted as someone who is silently questioning the audience: \"What will become of these people and their class?\" Seurat paints their prospects bleakly, cloaked as they are in shadow and suspicion of sin.BBC, The Private Life of a Masterpiece (2005) Series 4, Georges Seurat: A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. In the 1950s, historian and Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch drew social and political significance from Seurat's La Grande Jatte. The historian's focal point was Seurat's mechanical use of the figures and what their static nature said about French society at the time. Afterward, the work received heavy criticism by many that centered on the artist's mathematical and robotic interpretation of modernity in Paris. According to historian of Modernism William R. Everdell: The border of the painting is, unusually, in inverted color, as if the world around them is also slowly inverting from the way of life they have known. Seen in this context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asni\u00e8res appears to be calling out to them, as if to say, \"We are the future. Come and join us\". ==Painting materials== Seurat painted the La Grande Jatte in three distinct stages.Inge Fiedler, La Grande Jatte: A Study of the Painting Materials, in Robert L. Herbert, Douglas W. Druick, Gloria Groom, Seurat and the Making of La Grande Jatte, University of California, 2004 In the first stage, which was started in 1884, Seurat mixed his paints from several individual pigments and was still using dull earth pigments such as ochre or burnt sienna. In the second stage, during 1885 and 1886, Seurat dispensed with the earth pigments and also limited the number of individual pigments in his paints. This change in Seurat's palette was due to his application of the advanced color theories of his time. His intention was to paint small dots or strokes of pure color that would then mix on the retina of the beholder to achieve the desired color impression instead of the usual practice of mixing individual pigments. Seurat's palette consisted of the usual pigments of his timeInge Fiedler, A Technical Evaluation of the Grande Jatte, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 14, No. 2, The Grande Jatte at 100 (1989), pp. 173-179+244-245Georges Seurat, 'Sunday afternoon on La Grande Jatte', ColourLex such as cobalt blue, emerald green and vermilion. Additionally, Seurat used then new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), predominantly for yellow highlights in the sunlit grass in the middle of the painting but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown\u2014a color degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime.. The discoloration of the originally bright yellow zinc yellow (zinc chromate) to brownish color is due to the chemical reaction of the chromate ions to orange-colored dichromate ions.Casadio, F., I. Fiedler, K. A. Gray, and R. Warta. Deterioration of zinc potassium chromate pigments: elucidating the effects of paint composition and environmental conditions on chromatic alteration.

In the third stage during 1888\u201389 Seurat added the colored borders to his composition. The results of investigation into the discoloration of this painting have been combined with further research into natural aging of paints to digitally rejuvenate the painting.Berns, R.S. Rejuvenating Seurat\u2019s Palette Using Color and Imaging Science: A Simulation, Website of R.S. Berns at Rochester Institute of Technology ==Acquisition by the Art Institute of Chicago== On display at the Art Institute of Chicago In 1923, Frederic Bartlett was appointed trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago. He and his second wife, Helen Birch Bartlett, loaned their collection of French Post- Impressionist and Modernist art to the museum. It was Mrs. Bartlett who had an interest in French and avant-garde artists and influenced her husband's collecting tastes. Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte was purchased on the advice of the Art Institute of Chicago's curatorial staff in 1924.The Art Institute of Chicago, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, 1884 In conceptual artist Don Celender's 1974\u201375 book Observation and Scholarship Examination for Art Historians, Museum Directors, Artists, Dealers and Collectors, it is claimed that the institute paid $24,000 for the work (over $354,000 in 2018 dollarsCPI Inflation Calculator). In 1958, the painting was loaned out for the only time: to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. On 15 April 1958, a fire there, which killed one person on the second floor of the museum, forced the evacuation of the painting, which had been on a floor above the fire in the Whitney Museum, which adjoined MoMA at the time.New York Times, Fire in Modern Museum; Most Art Safe; 6 Canvases Burned, Seurat's Removed, 16 April 1958 ==In popular culture== Topiary Park in Columbus, Ohio, replicates much of the painting The May 1976 issue of Playboy magazine featured Nancy Cameron\u2014Playmate of the Month in January 1974\u2014on its cover, superimposed on the painting in similar style. The often hidden bunny logo was disguised as one of the millions of dots.Lucass Pivey, Stagerism Alert: Seurat The painting and the life of its artist were the basis for the 1984 Broadway musical Sunday in the Park with George by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Subsequently, the painting is sometimes referred to by the misnomer \"Sunday in the Park\". The painting is prominently featured in the 1986 comedy film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Such use is parodied, among others, in Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Family Guy, and Muppet Babies. In the Simpsons episode \"Mom and Pop Art\" (10x19), Barney Gumble offers to pay for a beer with a handmade reproduction of the painting. In Topiary Park (formerly Old Deaf School Park) in Columbus, Ohio, sculptor James T. Mason re-created the painting in topiary form;The Topiary Park: A Unique Interpretation of a Painting the installation was completed in 1989. The painting was the inspiration for a commemorative poster printed for the 1993 Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix, with racing cars and the Detroit skyline added. In 2011, the cast of the US version of The Office re-created the painting for a poster to promote the show's seventh- season finale. The cover photo of the June 2014 edition of San Francisco magazine, \"The Oakland Issue: Special Edition\", features a scene on the shore of Lake Merritt that re-creates the poses of the figures in Seurat's painting. ==Related works by Seurat== File:Study for La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.jpg|Study for La Grand Jatte File:Georges Seurat 023.jpg|Die Insel La Grande Jatte mit Ausfl\u00fcglern, 1884 File:Georges Seurat 051.jpg|Paysage et personnages, 1884\u201385 File:Georges Seurat 038.jpg|Groupe de personnages, 1884\u201385 File:Georges Seurat 034.jpg|Esquisse d'ensemble, 1884\u201385 File:Georges Seurat 035.jpg|Femmes au bord de l'eau, 1885\u201386 File:Georges Seurat - Les Poseuses.jpg|Models (Les Poseuses) 1886-1888 ==See also== * 100 Great Paintings ==References== ==Further reading== * * William R.
