    "text": "Dream Street is a 1921 American silent romantic drama film directed by D. W. Griffith, and starring Carol Dempster, Charles Emmett Mack, and Ralph Graves in a story about a love triangle set in London, and based on two short stories by Thomas Burke, \"Gina of Chinatown\" and \"Song of the Lamp\". The cast also features Tyrone Power, Sr. The film, released by United Artists, was poorly received in its day, and critics still consider it one of Griffith's worst films. ==Cast== Dream Street (full film) * Carol Dempster as Gypsy Fair * Charles Emmett Mack as Billy McFadden * Ralph Graves as James Spike McFadden * Edward Peil Sr. as Swan Way * Tyrone Power Sr. as Street Preacher * Morgan Wallace as Masked Violinist * William J. Ferguson as Gypsy's Father * George Neville as Tom Chudder * Charles Slattery as Police Inspector * Porter Strong as Samuel Jones ==Premiere== The original 1921 version of Dream Street is notable for a brief sequence when D. W. Griffith steps out in front of a curtain at the beginning of the movie, and talks to the audience about the film, using Photokinema, an early sound-on-disc process developed by Orlando Kellum. Some films made in the Photokinema process, including Griffith's Dream Street introduction at the beginning, are preserved at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The silent version premiered on April 12, 1921, at the Central Theatre in New York City. On April 27, Griffith and Ralph Graves recorded their respective sound segments at Orlando Kellum's Photokinema office at 203 West 40th Street.\"Griffith to Present Sound Film at Town Hall Tomorrow\", The New York Times (May 1, 1921), Drama and Music section, p. 78 The premiere engagement of the sound version of Dream Street took place on May 2, 1921, at Town Hall in New York City, with Griffith's introduction. The film reopened on May 15, now also with two other short sound sequences \u2014 Ralph Graves singing a love song, and background noise in a scene showing a craps game. No other theaters could show the sound version of the film, for no other theaters had the Photokinema sound system installed.Scott Eyman, The Speed of Sound (1997), page 43 On Sunday, May 29, Dream Street opened at the Schubert- Crescent Theater in Brooklyn with a program of short films made in Phonokinema. However, business was poor, and the program soon closed. ==Reception== Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide describes the film as \"disappointing\", owing to Dempster and her performance.TCM entry for film ==References== ==External links== * * *Progressive Silent Film List: Dream Street at silentera.com Category:1921 films Category:1921 romantic drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films based on works by Thomas Burke Category:Films directed by D.
