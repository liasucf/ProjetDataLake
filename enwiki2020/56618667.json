    "text": "Reuben Asberry Jr., better known by the stage name Kennedy Davenport, is a drag queen, television personality, and dancer from Dallas, Texas who came to international attention on the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race, placing fourth overall, and on the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, where she was the runner-up. == Career == Davenport first appeared on television in the eighth season of America's Got Talent in 2013. She was eliminated in the Vegas round. He was announced as one of the fourteen contestants in season seven of RuPaul's Drag Race on March 2, 2015, where he placed fourth overall. After this, he made a one-episode appearance on Skin Wars with fellow Drag Race contestants. On October 20, 2017, Davenport was announced as one of the returning queens for RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 3. Davenport ultimately was the runner-up overall, losing to Trixie Mattel. Outside of Drag Race, Asberry has won numerous titles in drag pageants, including Miss Gay Orlando 2016, Miss D\u2019Elegance International 2013, and Miss Gay Black USofA 2009. His dance performances are his signature component. Davenport also works as a musician; he released his first single, \"Moving Up\", featuring rapper Dresia Dee on March 16, 2018. In July 2020, he returned to the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars as a Lip-Sync Assassin. == Personal life == His father, Reuben Asberry Sr., died in October 25, 2013. A $33,000 bank payment was needed to prevent his house foreclosed upon. A GoFundMe page was created to help pay off the house note, and a drag event was held to support him, featuring fellow Drag Race alumni. His drag mother is Kelexis Davenport, who is also drag mother to the late season 2 Drag Race contestant Sahara Davenport. Another one of Kennedy's drag sisters, Bianca Gisele Davenport Starr, was murdered on December 8, 2017. Drag Race season 11 contestant A'keria Chanel Davenport, and other Drag Race Contestants throughout the years (Honey Davenport, Mon\u00e9t X Change and Ra'Jah O'Hara) are among members of the Davenport drag family. == Pageant history == * Miss Gay Black USofA 2009 * Miss Tampa Bay International 2009 * Miss Glamorous 2010 * North Carolina All American Goddess 2010 * Miss Parliament House 2010 * Miss Revolution 2010 * Miss Treasure Coast 2010 * Miss Gay South Central States USofA 2011 * Miss Parliament House 2011 * Miss Gay Georgia USofA 2012 * Miss Texas FFI 2012 * Mid America All American Goddess 2013 * All American Goddess (3rd Alternate) * Miss D\u2019Elegance International 2013 * Miss Gay Orlando 2016 * Miss West Palm Beach International 2016 * Miss Gay Texas USofA 2017 (1st Alternate) * Miss Gay USofA 2017 (1st Alternate) *Miss Gay USofA 2019 * Miss Pride South Florida 2019 ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
