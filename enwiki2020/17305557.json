    "text": "H Gallery is an art gallery in Bang Rak District, Bangkok, Thailand. It is located in a beautiful 125-year-old Anglo-Thai mansion. Established in 2002 by American-born Ernest H. Lee, the two-storey gallery specialises in contemporary art with a mostly Asian focus. H Gallery began working with the Irish-born art critic and curator Brian Curtin in 2011. Curtin inaugurated H Project Space, on the second floor, as a venue for experimental projects including performance, and he continues to also curate much of the main program. 2012 saw the opening of H Gallery Chiang Mai, in Northern Thailand, with an installation of paintings by the Thai artist Mit Jai-Inn. The gallery has worked with a variety of local and foreign artists, including Tada Hengsapkul, Michael Lee, Sopheap Pich, Olivier Pin-Fat and Pinaree Sanpitak. ==References== ==External links== * H Gallery official website Category:Museums in Bangkok Category:Museums established in 1999 Category:Art museums and galleries in Thailand Category:1999 establishments in Thailand ",
