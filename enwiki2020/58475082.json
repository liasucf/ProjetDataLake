    "text": "Jean Conte (12 May 1830 \u2013 1 April 1888) was a French composer, violinist and music teacher. Born in Toulouse, Conte attended the Conservatoire of Toulouse, founded shortly before as a branch of the Conservatoire de Paris, which at the time was directed by Louis Debrucq. After outstanding results in violin and solf\u00e8ge he was sent to Paris, where he studied violin with Jean-Delphin Alard and Lambert Massart and musical composition with Michele Carafa. Conte financed his studies as a conductor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Jeunes-Acteurs, founded by Louis Comte and directed by Jacques Offenbach in 1855. In that year Conte won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome with the cantata Acis et Galat\u00e9e after Camille du Locle. During his stay at the Villa Medici in Rome, traditionally associated with the prize, he composed a Messe solennelle (1856), the Italian opera Isabelle di Lara (1857) as well as a Dies irae and a symphony. After his return to Paris Conte became a teacher at the music school of the Fr\u00e8res de Passy and in 1867 violist in the orchestra of the Paris Opera and the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire. Together with Adrien Barthe he composed a double concerto for violin and piano based on Italian songs. At the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, his opera Beppo was premiered in 1877 after a libretto by du Locle. Furthermore, he composed a number of songs (O\u00f9 vont donc les hirondelles, Le Grand Veneur, La Marchande de plaisirs) and published a M\u00e9thode de violon.
