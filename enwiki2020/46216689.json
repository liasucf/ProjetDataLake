He grew up one of five children on a rural smallholding in the middle of the North Yorkshire Moors. His first job was picking potatoes on the local farms and he has since been an antique furniture restorer, a grain tester, a plasterer\u2019s mate, a football coach and a corporate lawyer. He is married and lives with his wife in Poland. ==The Rule== Colman says that the idea for his novel came as he was attending a lecture at King's College, London where the lecturer made a comment on how past societies could have been governed with just one rule. Colman worked on the idea and book while studying and working as a corporate lawyer in London. He then submitted it to HarperVoyager's open submission process for sci-fi and fantasy. 15 books were selected from 5,000 entries, including The Rule. The Rule is set in a Viking kingdom called Hellvik. It will be released on e-book 26 March 2015 and on paperback in October 2015. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ryedale (district) Category:Writers from Yorkshire ",
