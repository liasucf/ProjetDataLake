His earliest comic work as a writer and inker appeared in Silverwolf Comics (Greater Mercury Comics) Eradicators in 1990. In 1993, he worked on-staff as an inker for Malibu Comics until 1996, when he was hired by Dark Horse Comics to provide inks for Godzilla and G.I. Joe Extreme comic book mini-series. For the next several years, he produced creator-owned online comics under his self-publishing label Webs Best Comics. In 2007, he and artist Shane White collaborated on The Overman, an apocalyptic noir science fiction mini-series published by Image Comics. In 2010, Reed wrote two mini-series for Marvel Comics, Realm of Kings: Son of Hulk, and Incredible Hulks: Enigma Force, which re-introduced several Microverse characters into the Marvel Universe. Both series were penciled by Miguel Munera. In 2012, Reed wrote, illustrated and published Saga Of A Doomed Universe, a graphic novel distributed digitally with Comixology and included in Boing-Boing's 'Best Damn Comics of the Year' of 2012. In 2015, Reed worked as a colorist on MidWalker, a comic book mini-series published by Fierce Comics. His latest graphic novel, Hark, is currently in production. ==Bibliography== * Reed, Scott.
