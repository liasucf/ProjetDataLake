    "text": "Ramin Takloo-Bighash (born 1974) is a mathematician who does research in the field of automorphic forms, best known for his computation of the local factors of spinor L-function attached to generic automorphic forms on GSp(4), as well as his works joint with Joseph Shalika and Yuri Tschinkel on the distribution of rational points on certain group compactifications. He is a co-author, with Steven J. Miller, of An Invitation To Modern Number Theory (Princeton University Press, 2006). ==Mathematical career== Takloo-Bighash graduated from the Sharif University of Technology, where he enrolled after winning a Silver medal at the 1992 International Mathematical Olympiad. In 2001, Takloo-Bighash graduated under Joseph Shalika from Johns Hopkins University. He spent 2001-2007 at Princeton University first as an instructor, and then an assistant professor. He is currently a tenured professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he has been working on Diophantine geometry and automorphic forms. ==External links== * Takloo-Bighash's web page at UIC * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian mathematicians Category:Iranian Mathematics Competition Medalists Category:Number theorists Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni ",
