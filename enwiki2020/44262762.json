Richardt in Prospecter af danske Herregaarde, 1861 Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd is a manor house in the parish of Hvilsager in Syddjurs Municipality in the eastern Jutland peninsula of Djursland, Denmark. It is not one of Denmark's largest manor-houses, but one of the best preserved. Inside there is an enormous oak closet carved by the Dutch carpenter Mikkel van Gronningen whose most famous work is the pulpit in \u00c5rhus Cathedral. The closet covers of wall space and, in view of its rich detail, is considered to be one of the most outstanding examples of carved wooden Renaissance furniture in Northern Europe. ==History== Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd was built around 1580 by Danish nobleman J\u00f8rgen Rosenkrantz (1523-1596) who had two sons: Otto Rosenkrantz and Holger Rosenkrantz (1574-1642). As soon as he was able, he built a manor for both of them: Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd and Rosenholm in 1559. Unfortunately Otto died early, after which Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd became a dower house for J\u00f8rgen's wife, Dorthe Lange, until her death in 1613. After this the estate was handed over to the son Holger. His son Gunde Rosenkrantz (1604-1675) had to sell it in 1647 because of poor finances. After that the estate often changed hands in the following century. One of the later owners was Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup (1825\u20131913) who acquired it in 1852. His descendants still own Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd. == Owners == *(1492\u20131503) Erik Ottesen Rosenkrantz *(1503\u20131520) Holger Eriksen Rosenkrantz *(1520\u20131542) Otte Holgersen Rosenkrantz *(1542\u20131596) J\u00f8rgen Ottesen Rosenkrantz *(1596\u20131613) Dorthe Lange (widow) *(1613\u20131642) Holger Rosenkrantz \"the learned\" *(1642\u20131647) Gunde Rosenkrantz *(1647\u20131666) Steen Bille *(1666\u20131681) Henrik Ditlev Holck *(1681\u20131712) Mette Steensdatter Bille married Holck *(1712\u20131749) Thomas Nicolaj Nielsen Behr *(1749\u20131778) Niels Thomsen Behr *(1778\u20131779) Niels Thomsen Behrs d\u00f8dsbo *(1779\u20131786) Poul Nielsen Behr *(1786\u20131797) Anna J\u00f8rgensdatter M\u00f8rch married Behr *(1797\u20131852) J\u00f8rgen M\u00f8rch Secher *(1852\u20131907) Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup *(1907\u20131939) Jacob Estrup (son) *(1939\u20131967) Niels Rudolph Estrup (nephew) *(1967\u20131971) Hector Estrup / Vilhelm Estrup / Christian Estrup (Niels' 3 sons) *(1971\u20132007) Hector Estrup *(2007\u2013 ) Jacob Christen Estrup (son) ==References== == External links == * Skaf\u00f8g\u00e5rd p\u00e5 1001 fort\u00e6llinger om Danmark Category:Manor houses in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures in Syddjurs Municipality Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1582 Category:Tourist attractions in Denmark Category:Tourist attractions in the Central Denmark Region Category:Buildings and structures in Denmark associated with the Rosenkrantz family Category:Buildings and structures associated with the Estrup family ",
