    "text": "Sa\u00efan Supa Crew (, ) was a French hip hop collective that was composed of three bands: Explicit Samoura\u00ef, OFX and Simple Spirit. It formed in 1997 and separated in 2007 after the departure of one of its leaders (along with Feniksi), Leeroy Kesiah. The name Sa\u00efan Supa was a reference to the Super Saiyan from the manga and anime Dragon Ball Z/GT. Sa\u00efan Supa Crew produced a very musical style of hip hop with hints of chanting, reggae, dancehall, zouk and ragga. Beat boxing also was an integral part of their music, as well as classic disco, for example, \"Ring My Bell\" was partially revisited on its album KLR; bossa nova, as heard on the song KLR, salsa, in \u00c0 Demi Nue, and even bits of classical music, in La Preuve par 3 and intros of various other songs. The variety and originality of their music, and their energic style brought them international recognition. In their home country, the song Angela was a huge hit in 2000 and sold 600,000 copies. Their primary themes extend from drug problems (\"Que Dit-On?\") to racism (\"La Preuve par 3\"), including also relationships (\"\u00c0 Demi Nue\"), suicide (\"La Derni\u00e8re S\u00e9ance\") and the justification of violence by religion (\"Au Nom de Quoi\"). Humor and seriousness were both at home in their lyrics. Their second album, X Raisons, was awarded a Victoire de la musique in 2002 for Best Rap/Groove album. Most of the groups of the collective have solo albums out as well. OFX was the first to debut, with their album Roots in February 2004, followed shortly by Explicit Samoura\u00ef in January 2005 and later by Sir Samu\u00ebl Viz\u00e9 pli \u00f4, whose solo album was released in April 2005. The last album from the Sa\u00efan Supa Crew, Hold Up, was released Halloween 2005. On this album, the group demonstrated their breadth with three featured artists: German singer Patrice on \"96 Degreez,\" the singer Camille on \"Si J'avais Su,\" and will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas on \"La Patte.\" They also contributed a short rap section on the song Flight Tonight by The Avalanches, which appears on their debut album, Since I Left You. ==Members== * Leeroy Kesiah member of Explicit Samoura\u00ef (born in 1978 as Khalid Dehbi, Bagneux 92) Left the group shortly before its dissolution in 2007. * Vicelow member of OFX (born in 1978 as C\u00e9dric B\u00e9lise, Bondy 93) * Sly the Mic Buddha member of Simple Spirit (born in 1974 as Silvere Johnson, Montrouge 92) * Feniksi member of OFX (born in 1976 as Samu\u00ebl Adebiyi, Noisy-le-Sec 93) * Specta member of Explicit Samoura\u00ef (born in 1975 as G\u00e9rard Nubul, Bagneux 92) Left the group in 2002. * Sir Samu\u00ebl (born in 1977 as Fabien Philetas, Sarcelles 95) * KLR member of OFX (born in Noisy-le- Sec 93) Died in 1999.
