    "text": "Mount Svinjak () is a mountain in northwestern Slovenia in the Julian Alps. It stands east-northeast of Bovec. The name of the mountain is derived from *Svitnjak 'shining one' (< svit 'dawn; light, shining') because it is illuminated by the rising sun when viewed from Bovec. The resemblance to the common noun svinjak (with various meanings: 'pigsty', 'pig dung'; 'cat's ear') is coincidental. ==References== ==External links== * Mount Svinjak at Geopedia.si * Point Svinjak (Peak).
