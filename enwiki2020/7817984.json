    "text": "Francis de Croisset (; born Franz Wiener, 28 January 1877 \u2013 8 November 1937) was a Belgian-born French playwright and opera librettist. ==Early life== He was born, as Franz Wiener, and educated in Brussels on 28 January 1877 into a prominent Belgian family that was distinguished in diplomacy and the army. His parents were Alexandre Jacques Wiener and Eugenie Bertha (n\u00e9e Straus) Wiener. After moving to France, where he spent most of his life, he had his name changed by Presidential decree. At age 17, he rebelled against his parents' wishes that he take up a military career, and ran away to Paris. The following year, his play The Ch\u00e9rubin was produced at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise where C\u00e9cile Sorel (later the Comtesse de S\u00e9gur) made her debut in it. Jules Massenet set Ch\u00e9rubin to music and, in 1904, Mary Garden sang it at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. ==Career== Mary Garden, at the 1905 premiere of Ch\u00e9rubin He was a lawyer by profession, but de Croisset gradually devoted more and more time to the theatre, \"until play writing became his vocation.\" His opera librettos include Massenet's Ch\u00e9rubin (1905), based on his play of the same name, and Reynaldo Hahn's Ciboulette (1923). In 1919, de Croisset came to the United States to study film for the French government. By 1927, his name was attached to more than fifty plays. In 1925, he collaborated with Somerset Maugham on Dr. Miracle, which was produced in New York City. Additional plays were produced in New York, including Pierre or Jack?. ===Military service=== Notwithstanding his aversion to a career in the military, upon the outbreak of World War I, he enlisted in the French Army as a private, serving for four years before mustering out as a Lieutenant. He was twice decorated for his gallantry, including being awarded the Croix de Guerre for his valor. ==Personal life== In 1909, he was engaged to Mlle. Isola, the daughter of one of the directors of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9. The engagement was broken off and, instead, he married wealthy widow Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bischoffsheim, in 1910. A daughter of Count and Countess Adh\u00e9aume de Chevign\u00e9, she was a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and her grandmother Laure de Sade was, in part, the inspiration for the character of the Duchess of Guermantes in Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past). From her first marriage to banking heir Maurice Bischoffsheim, she had a daughter, the arts patron Marie-Laure de Noailles (later the Vicomtesse de Noailles from her 1923 marriage to Charles, Vicomte de Noailles). Together, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Francis were the parents of two children: * Philippe de Croisset (1912\u20131965), who married Ethel Woodward, a daughter of American banker William Woodward, in 1941. After having two sons, they divorced and Philippe married Jacqueline de la Chaume. After his death in 1965, she became the third wife of actor Yul Brynner. * Germaine de Croisset (1913\u20131975), who married Marquis Andr\u00e9 Roger Lannes de Montebello (1908\u20131986), in 1933.
