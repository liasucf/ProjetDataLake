As a result of not being able to build the car they had originally planned, Mazda lost interest in the Kei class and sales halted without a replacement in 1976, on the eve of new Kei car regulations. Mazda did not market another Kei passenger car until 1989 with a reintroduction of the Carol, which was a rebadged Suzuki Alto, and to this day still choose not to make their own engines for the Kei class. Equipment levels ranged from the lowest spec L (less chrome, body colored bumpers and B-pillars), via the LX, GL, GF, and GL II to the top of the line GF II, which featured a sports interior, radial tires, and available two-tone paint. In late 1974, anticipating a changing law at the turn of the year, the trunklid and front bumper were modified to fit larger-size license plates. ==References== Chantez Category:Kei cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:1970s cars ",
