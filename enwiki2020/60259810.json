    "text": "Marta Linden (born Marta Leffler; October 24, 1903 - December 13, 1990) was an American actress. Linden was born in New York, the daughter of Swedish parents. In the 1920s, she married businessman Albert Schmid, whose fortune disappeared in the Great Depression. After her husband lost his fortune, Linden found a job working at a candy counter. Eventually she decided that opportunity awaited in Hollywood, so the family moved there. Her acting at the Pasadena Community Playhouse developed into playing female leads. That exposure, in turn, led to interest from film executives. Linden's Broadway credits include The Starcross Story (1954), The Curious Savage (1950), Cry of the Peacock (1950), The Men We Marry (1948), and Present Laughter (1946). She also acted in the touring version of Present Laughter. In 1942, Linden signed a long-term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Films in which she appeared included The Youngest Profession (1943), A Yank at Eton (1942), Maisie Goes to Reno (1944), and Stand By for Action (1942). In 1954, Linden appeared in the soap opera Woman with a Past on CBS-TV. On December 13, 1990, Linden died of pneumonia at Lenox Hill Hospital at age 87. ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century American actresses Category:American film actresses Category:American stage actresses Category:American television actresses Category:Actresses from New York (state) Category:Broadway actors ",
