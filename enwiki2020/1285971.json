    "text": "Salvatore Paul \"Sully\" Erna Jr. (born February 7, 1968) is an American musician, best known as the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for rock band Godsmack. He is also a harmonica player, percussionist and pianist, performing these on albums and at live shows. He was ranked 47th in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader. ==Early life== Sully Erna was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He began playing drums at the age of three. His father, Salvatore Erna, was a trumpet player and would rehearse in the basement where Sully would watch and fall asleep in an empty guitar case. His great-uncle was a famous composer in Sicily. At the age of 11, Erna discovered that it was easier for him to listen to something and play it than read sheet music. He stopped taking lessons and practiced at home, rehearsing to records by Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Mot\u00f6rhead, and Rush. ==Musical career== At 14, Dave Vose became Erna's new instructor. He signed his first record deal in 1993 with a band called Strip Mind. Their debut album What's in Your Mouth sold fewer than 50,000 units. Some of the band members (mainly the singer) and Erna didn't get along, and Erna was booted out. They split-up shortly after. In Godsmack concerts, Erna plays the bongos and a large drum set, staging a drumming duel known as \"Batalla de los Tambores\" with drummer Shannon Larkin. This battle has become a staple of the band's live show. He is also a harmonica player as present on the Godsmack song \"Shine Down.\" In 2010, Erna released his first solo album Avalon. The album took seven years to complete and differed stylistically from Godsmack. Erna wrapped up his acoustic tour with one final show at The House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 28. Erna has also worked with his local music scene. In April 2005, he participated in New Hampshire's Battle of the Bands Competition. The winner (a band called Zion who hails from Salem) had the opportunity to record a demo at Erna's California studio. ===Solo work=== Erna told Glam-Metal.com that doing his first solo shows were \"extremely nerve-wracking,\" adding, \"My first show, I was really, really nervous. Honestly, I haven't been that nervous since I was, I don't know, maybe 10 years old at a talent show or something.\" Erna kicked off his first solo acoustic trek on 1 May in Niagara Falls, New York and closed it out on May 31 in Las Vegas. The shows have combined Godsmack songs with a few new originals and covers ranging from the Beatles to Alice in Chains to the theme from Love Story. Regarding how he went about selecting the material used for his solo show, Erna said, \"I wanted to stick a couple of originals in and try them out because there was a couple of songs that were done on the piano or the guitar that I wrote that I don't think I would use on a GODSMACK record,\" he said. \"For example, 'Eyes of a Child' and 'Until Then'. It was a great opportunity to showcase that and see if I can hit home with the people on those two pieces. Those songs are the most emotional pieces of the evening. One song is about children born with or dying from AIDS and the other is about a tribute to the troops of the United States Armed Forces.\" Erna told The Pulse of Radio that playing some new material live is a good way for him to test out songs that might not work for Godsmack. \"We're all musicians and we like to write music and not necessarily rock all the time,\" he said. \"So, you know, if I sit home and I'm writing on the piano and sometimes just cool songs are written that don't necessarily fit maybe what you do with Godsmack, but you don't wanna not record them.\" Erna stated at the time that he planned to work on his first solo album. On March 4, 2009, Blabbermouth.net reported that Erna had completed work on his first solo album, Avalon, released September 14, 2010. Although, the single Sinner's Prayer will be on radio stations and on sale everywhere August 3, 2010. Erna described the album as being \"a very different kind of sounding record,\" and \"a huge departure from anything I've ever done.\" The album includes Lisa Guyer on vocals, Tim Theriault on guitars and vocals, Chris Decato on keyboards, midi and vocals, Chris Lester on acoustic guitars and bass, classically trained Irina Chirkova of Bulgaria on Cello, Niall Gregory of Ireland Dead Can Dance on drums and percussion and David Stephanelli on drums and percussion. Three days later, Rockerrazzi.com posted an interview with Erna in which he said that the record \"should be out in the next two months.\" In further describing the album's sound, Erna said that \"it's very eclectic\" and \"tribal\" with \"a lot of hand drumming\" and \"beautiful piano compositions.\" He also stated that he \"worked with a percussion session for Dead Can Dance\" and that the album will feature Lisa Guyer, who had performed backing vocals for the song \"Hollow\" on Godsmack's previous album. Erna's debut solo album is titled Avalon, and was released on September 14, 2010. He released a live DVD, Avalon Live, in fall of 2012. Erna released a very special limited-edition Avalon box set in November as well as a DVD of the Erna performing songs from his debut solo album, Avalon, on December 16, 2011 at The Wilbur Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts.

In July 2016, it was announced that Erna will release his second solo album Hometown Life on September 30, 2016. The album has since been released. Hometown Life includes a song \"Turn It Up\", for which Erna invited his father into the recording studio to play trumpet on the track.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsTNe90s8Sk His father performed the song live with Erna at a Sully Erna solo show. ==Other activities== ===Film and music video appearances=== Erna is good friends with Criss Angel and has participated in several episodes of the Criss Angel Mindfreak TV show.

The book details his struggles during the first 30 years of his life, up until the time Godsmack landed a record deal. \"The book is basically just my life from the time I was born until Godsmack started,\" Erna said. \"I wanted to write about the whole experience of trying to get there, and hopefully that will inspire some people that maybe are still in the ghettos or trying to dig their way out of a hole. I mean, we're all human and we weren't born rock stars. So I think there's an interesting story to tell of the pain and struggling. You know, being middle classed and being raised in crazy neighborhoods. If kids can see that they'll be able to relate to anything they have a dream for.\" The book sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release, and to date has shipped 1,000,000 copies worldwide. ===Poker=== Erna at the World Series of Poker in 2006 Erna participated in the 2006 World Series of Poker main event in which he made a brief appearance on the ESPN broadcast of the event; it was mentioned that he was the last of the celebrity entries.

Retrieved on January 28, 2010. ===Hometown Sessions=== Erna launched a bi-weekly web series on YouTube called Hometown Sessions. The talk show have Erna hosting some celebrity guests. He explained about contents of the show: ==Controversy== On October 9, 2010, Godsmack was performing at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut, when Erna spewed a lengthy diatribe at the audience; and when a fan\u2014who wasn't enjoying the show after mentioning Erna's distaste for Creed\u2014flipped him off, Erna said: \"You like Creed? You like Scott Stapp? He's a faggot! Faggot!\" His comments were met with cheers from the crowd. Erna later issued an apology to Stapp and the members of Creed for his derogatory remarks, and explained that there had been several years of bad blood between himself and Stapp, following an incident in which Stapp refused an autograph request from a fan, which was witnessed by Erna. Stapp responded to Erna's apology on Twitter and said he forgave him. ===Car accident=== Erna was involved in a three-car chain- reaction accident in Methuen, Massachusetts, when his vehicle and two others collided at an intersection. \"He's deeply concerned for the girl who was hurt in this unfortunate accident,\" said Erna's manager Paul Geary, in reference to 25-year-old Chelmsford resident Lindsay Taylor. \"Sully's thankful he got out with a split lip and some aches and pains, but he's traumatized about the girl,\" according to April 17, 2007, Boston Herald. Taylor was sitting in the back seat of a dark blue Toyota Camry that collided with the H3 driven by Erna. The crash occurred on a dark night, around 7 p.m. on the ramp leading from I-93 south to Route 213. Taylor suffered a severe, traumatic brain injury and was in a coma after the crash. She suffered lasting effects, and would later sue. A settlement was reached in 2010. ===Religious views=== Erna was a practicing Wiccan early in his career. His spirituality influences some of his songwriting to include the song \"Spiral\" from Godsmack's second album Awake and \"Releasing the Demons\" from their third album Faceless. He has stated publicly, however, that he \"didn't want to be the poster boy for witchcraft\", and does not necessarily capitalize on his religion for providing fame to the band. In fact, the issue of his religious beliefs never comes up unless he is asked in an interview. However, recently he mentioned that he does not follow any specific religion. \"I'm just a spiritual person; I believe in karma and things like that. But religion is an ugly word to me,\" Erna explained. It is commonly believed that the Godsmack song \"Voodoo\" is about heroin addiction, but is instead a reference to the story of The Serpent and the Rainbow. ==Gear== ;Drums Acoustic drums: Yamaha Absolute Birch\"Sully Erna Drums Gear\" Yamaha.com.
