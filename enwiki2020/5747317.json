It was promoted as being \"The first Interactive Adventure Film using Full Motion Video Technology\" and contained four graphical elements: full motion video, hand painted and digitized backgrounds and 3D decor. == Plot == In 1992, a woman exploring a shipwreck has mysteriously been transported back in time to 1840 when the ship was still intact, she has no choice but to explore. Her sleuthing leads to revelations about her past. == Release == The original release in Europe was divided into two parts that is, two sets of 3.5\" Floppy disks sold separately. A CD-ROM version Lost in Time: Parts 1 & 2, was released at the same time as the floppy version and contained enough storage space for both parts as well as additional and longer video sequences with a higher frame rate and audible dialogue. In North America, the game was released on separate floppy disk and CD-ROM sets as well however, the floppy disk set was not split into separate parts and was released in a single, complete package. ==Reception== In April 1994 Computer Gaming World said of Lost in Time on CD that \"Though game play is interesting and movement through the 3D world is fluid\", the video and music was not as good as in Inca. The magazine concluded that despite some \"obtuse\" puzzles, \"there's still enough going on to entice those gamers who missed catching reruns of Time Tunnel\". ==References== == External links == * Category:1993 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Coktel Vision games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:First-person adventure games Category:Full motion video based games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games featuring female protagonists ",
