    "text": "Douglas Creek is a creek in Douglas County, Washington. It rises in Douglas County, flows through Moses Coulee then empties to Wanapum Lake on the Columbia River. The course of the creek through Moses Coulee displays an \"outdoor geologic laboratory\" exhibiting basalt formations and relics of the Missoula floods of the last ice age. The watershed of Douglas Creek proper covers , about 11% of the county, but including McCarteny Creek the entire Moses Coulee drainage is or a little more than half of the county. The creek's flow reaches the Columbia River \"during storm water runoff events\", otherwise being absorbed into the aquifer. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Rivers of Douglas County, Washington ",
