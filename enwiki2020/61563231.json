Having been a ranking event since 2010, the event was changed to an invitational basis, with no ranking points allocated. This was because the WPBSA did not want to finance a ranking event with 128 players with a small prize fund. Independent promoter Snookerstars.de promoted the event providing the prize money, then the WPBSA added their sanction to the event. The Paul Hunter Classic was named after deceased snooker professional, Paul Hunter, who won the event in 2004, before passing in 2006. A total of 15 players were invited to compete in the event, with one qualifier, who had won a qualifying event featuring 36 participants. 13-year-old Iulian Boiko won the qualifying event, defeating Barry Pinches in the final 3\u20132.

Murphy later revealed that he pulled out of the event due to tearing his Achilles tendon, dancing to Disney's Greatest Hits. All matches held in the event were played as best-of-7-. An exhibition Speed cup event featuring the same players was played concurrently with the main event, with matches played as best-of-5-frames. The players were also against the clock.

The event was broadcast online-only on the Eurosport Player. ===Prize fund=== The event features a total prize fund of \u20ac13,500 and \u20ac5,000 awarded to the winner.
