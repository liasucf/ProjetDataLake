The film was funded by donors from Kickstarter, and the first festival screening was in February 2015 in Indianapolis. ==Plot summary== In this \"lost slasher film from 1978,\" a masked killer wages an unrelenting spree of murder, cannibalism, and necrophilia. But when his tortured past comes back to haunt him, he plunges to even greater depths of madness and depravity, consuming the lives of a young woman and those she holds dear. ==Cast== * Shane Beasley as The Killer :: Kaden Miller as Skull Boy / The Killer (Child) :: Matt Keeley as The Killer (Teenager) * Kelsey Carlisle as Jess Hardy * Ellie Church as Betsy Coard * Dave Parker as Pete Christy * Jennifer Lee as The Hitchhiker ==Release== ==Reception== HorrorNews.net awarded the film score of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer calling it \"the most intensely disturbing film I\u2019ve seen since Found\". PopHorror.com wrote, \"While Headless might prove a bit too much for some viewers, those in the market for more extreme and depraved fare will do themselves a disservice if they pass [it] up.\" Richard Taylor from Severed Cinema awarded the film 4/5 stars, calling it \"one of the top horror movies of the year\" while noting that it \"gasses out a bit by the time the final act rolls out\". ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:2010s serial killer films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American serial killer films Category:American slasher films Category:Kickstarter- funded films Category:English-language films ",
