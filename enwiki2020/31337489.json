Velasco & G. Rincon (2008). Occurrence of freshwater stingrays (Chondrichthyes: Potamotrygonidae) in the Uruguay River and its tributaries, Uruguay, South America. International Journal of Ichthyology 14 (2): 69-76. It is sometimes known as the giant freshwater stingray, but this name is typically used for the southeast Asian Himantura polylepis. Growing to a disc diameter of about and a weight of , the short- tailed river stingray is the largest freshwater species in its familyFishing World Records: Potamotrygon brachyura. Retrieved 14 January 2016. and one of the heaviest strict freshwater fish in South America, only matched by the arapaima (Arapaima) and pira\u00edba catfish (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum). The primary threat to the short-tailed river stingray is fishing for food and as a game fish, but it is also under pressure from habitat loss and occasionally caught for aquaria. ==Description== The short-tailed river stingray is circular in shape and humped in the back.River Monsters, First Edition, Da Capo Press, 2011, p. 165 The species can reach about in disc diameter and in weight, making it the largest freshwater species in the family Potamotrygonidae (the discus ray Paratrygon aiereba can reach a slightly larger disc width, but weighs considerably less). They have a dark pattern on their backs, probably used as camouflage. The ray's tail is very muscular and thick, covered with short spines at the base and a venomous sting at the end.River Monsters, First Edition, Da Capo Press, 2011, p. 162 == Distribution == The short-tailed river stingray is found in the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin, including the Paraguay, Paran\u00e1 and Uruguay Rivers in the countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It may also range into Bolivia in the Pilcomayo River (a tributary of the Paraguay River), but this remains unconfirmed. In the north it ranges from the upper Paraguay River basin, including the Pantanal, and south to the lowermost freshwater sections of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Unlike some other freshwater rays, it has not been able to spread to the upper Paran\u00e1 River basin after the Itaipu Dam flooded the Gua\u00edra Falls, which represented a natural barrier to its range. ==Lifestyle== Female short-tailed river stingrays give birth to up to 19 fully formed young stingrays per litter. The pups start off eating plankton and then move on to consume small mollusks, crustaceans, the larvae of aquatic insects, and fish. == References == == External links == * Species description of Potamotrygon brachyura at www.shark-references.com brachyura Category:Freshwater fish of Argentina Category:Freshwater fish of Brazil Category:Fish of Paraguay Category:Fish of Uruguay Category:Fauna of the Pantanal Category:Fish described in 1880 ",
