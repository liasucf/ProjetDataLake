He began his education in Tel\u010d. On the recommendation of his secondary school teachers, he was enrolled at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, where he studied from 1905 to 1908.Brief biography @ the Tel\u010d website. He then transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts and became a student of Hanu\u0161 Schwaiger.\"Franti\u0161ek Mo\u0159ic N\u00e1gl se vr\u00e1til\" @ Holocaust.cz After graduating, he took up residence in Vienna. During World War I, he was called up for service, fought on the Balkan Front, and was seriously wounded in the right shoulder. Following surgery, he was able to recover the use of his hand, but always required a prop to hold up his arm. The Market at N\u00e1vs\u00ed Despite this, he was determined to continue painting but, as the only son, his ailing father wanted him to take over the family farm. N\u00e1gl deferred to his father's wishes and settled into a farmer's life. He still made time for painting, however, and was able to participate in an exhibition at the Rudolfinum not long after. In 1920, he married a violinist named Vlasta Nettelov\u00e1. He drew his inspiration from the countryside and village life and his reputation as a \"peasant painter\" increased during the 1920s and 1930s. This led to major exhibitions in Brno in 1933 and Ostrava in 1937. Living Quarters at Theresienstadt In 1939, he and his family were evicted from the farm and their property was seized. For two years, they rented an apartment in Tel\u010d then, in 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo while working at his easel in the town square. He was imprisoned in Brno until May, 1942, when his entire family was transported to Theresienstadt. Later, they were transferred to Auschwitz, where they were all put to death over the course of two years. During his time at Theresienstadt, he continued to create drawings and watercolors, but no one knew of their existence until 1950, when they were discovered in the bricked-up attic of a house that was undergoing reconstruction. A year later, they were presented at a major exhibition sponsored by the M\u00e1nes Union of Fine Arts. Exhibitions have also been held in Tel\u010d and Prague. A plaque in his honor has been placed where he was arrested in the Tel\u010d town square. ==References== == External links == *Memorial plaque, with brief biography @ Spolek pro vojensk\u00e1 pietn\u00ed m\u00edsta (Vets.cz) *N\u00e1gl's farmhouse @ Wildtramper Category:1889 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Jihlava District Category:People from the Margraviate of Moravia Category:20th-century Czech painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Landscape painters Category:Jewish painters Category:Austro- Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Czech Jews who died in the Holocaust Category:Czech people who died in Auschwitz concentration camp Category:Czech male painters ",
