    "text": "Gin and juice is a fruity cocktail made from gin and fruit juice. A gin and juice can be made by mixing: gin (such as Tanqueray), lime juice, ruby red grapefruit juice, and simple syrup. Half orange and half grapefruit is also a possibility for the fruit juice component. In Europe this cocktail is usually made by mixing gin with red grape juice. The gin and juice may have inspired the song Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg. The lyrics to the song California Gurls by Katy Perry have a reference to \"Sippin' gin and juice / Laying underneath the palm trees\". ==References== Category:Cocktails with gin Category:Fruity cocktails ",
