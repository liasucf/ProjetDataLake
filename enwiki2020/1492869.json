The highest point of the region is Malkamud Mount (3879 m). It is the border with the Russian Federation in the north, with Gabala in the east, Sheki in the west, and with Agdash in the south. == History == The remains of a prehistoric man were found near the villages of Kerimli and Garabaglar, based on the results of archaeological excavations. Stone figurines, various tools, and household items were found here. The district was part of the Ganja Province, which existed on April 3, 1952 - April 23, 1953. This province was abolished by the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated April 23, 1953. Administrative-territorial reforms were carried out in 1962\u20131964 in connection with the establishment of agricultural department and establishment of national economical boards in the territory of the USSR. As a result, industrial and agricultural districts were established on the basis of the large districts. On January 4, 1963, 31 districts and 7 cities were established in the Azerbaijan SSR in the territory of six towns with 50 districts. According to this decision, the city of Nukha (Shaki since 1968) was established and the villages of the district are included in Vartashen district. This reform was canceled on January 6, 1965, due to inefficiency. For this reason, villages included in Vartashen district were subordinated to Nukha. Until 1961, Vartashen village was the center of the Vartashan district. According to the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR, the name of Vartashan was renamed Oguz in February 1991. == Population == According to the report of the State Statistics Committee, the total number of population in 2010 was 37,000.
