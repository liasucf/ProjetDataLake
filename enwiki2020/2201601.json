Originally the Soviet Navy wanted a supercarrier similar to the American . However, the smaller Kiev-class design was chosen because it was considered to be more cost effective. Unlike most NATO aircraft carriers, such as U.S. or most British ones, the Kiev class is a combination of both a cruiser and an aircraft carrier. In the Soviet Navy, this class of ships was specifically designated as a \"heavy aviation cruiser\" () rather than solely an aircraft carrier. This designation allowed the ships to transit the Turkish Straits, while the Montreux Convention prohibited aircraft carriers heavier than 15,000 tons from passing through the Straits. The ships were designed with a large island superstructure to starboard, with an angled flight deck 2/3rds of the length of the total deck, and the foredeck was taken up with heavy surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missile armament. The intended mission of the Kiev class was support for strategic missile submarines, other surface ships and naval aviation; it was capable of engaging in anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and surface warfare. A total of four Kiev-class carriers were built and commissioned, serving in the Soviet and then Russian Navy. The first two ships were sold to China as museums, and the third ship was scrapped. The fourth ship, , was sold to the Indian Navy in 2004, and after years of extensive modifications and refurbishment, is currently in active service as . == General characteristics == * Designer: Nevskoye Planning and Design Bureau * Builder: Nikolayev South (formerly Chernomorsky Shipyard 444) * Power plant: 8 turbopressurized boilers, 4 steam turbines (200,000 shp), four shafts * Length: overall ( for Baku subgroup) * Flight Deck Width: * Beam: * Displacement: 43,000\u201345,500 metric tons full load * Speed: * Aircraft: 26\u201330 ** 12\u201313 Yak-38 VSTOL ** 14\u201317 Ka-25 or Ka-27/29 helicopters * Crew: 1,200\u20131,600 (including air wing) * Armament: ** Kiev and Minsk: *** 4 \u00d7 twin P-500 Bazalt SSM launchers (8 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 twin M-11 Shtorm SAM launchers (72 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 twin 9K33 Osa launchers (40 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 AK-726 twin 76.2 mm AA guns *** 8 \u00d7 AK-630 30 mm CIWS *** 10 \u00d7 21\" torpedo tubes *** 1 \u00d7 twin SUW-N-1 FRAS Anti-Submarine Rocket launcher ** Novorossiysk: *** 4 \u00d7 twin P-500 Bazalt SSM launchers (8 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 twin M-11 Shtorm SAM launchers (72 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 AK-726 twin 76.2 mm AA guns *** 8 \u00d7 AK-630 30 mm CIWS *** 1 \u00d7 twin SUW-N-1 FRAS Anti-Submarine Rocket launcher ** Baku: *** 6 \u00d7 twin P-500 Bazalt SSM launchers (12 missiles) *** 24 \u00d7 8-cell 9K330 Tor vertical SAM launchers (192 missiles) *** 2 \u00d7 100 mm guns *** 8 \u00d7 AK-630 30 mm CIWS *** 10 \u00d7 21\" torpedo tubes *** 2 \u00d7 RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers * Date deployed: 1975 (Kiev) == Ships == {|class=\"wikitable\" |-bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !
