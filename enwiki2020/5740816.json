Brian had sung back-ups for Douglas \"Buzz\" Shearman (Original singer who had on/off again vocal cord problems) on tour back in 1977, worked with Buddy Caine and Terry Juric in the band Voodoo, and worked with \"Buzz\" in a building materials store in the early 1980s. The album was released in 2002 accompanied by the remastered/re-edited/re- sequenced version of Moxy V. The album contains live-off-the-floor new recordings of songs from the band's first three albums from the 1970s.
