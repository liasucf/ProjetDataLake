He stood as the UPADS candidate in the 2016 presidential election. ==Political career== In the June-July 1992 parliamentary election, Tsaty Mabiala was elected to the National Assembly as a UPADS candidate. After the election, the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) formed an alliance with the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD), and together the two held a parliamentary majority. On 24 September 1992, the National Assembly, controlled by the URD-PCT alliance, elected its Bureau; UPADS, as part of the parliamentary opposition, received two secondary posts in the seven-member Bureau, one of which went to Tsaty Mabiala, who was elected as Second Secretary of the National Assembly.Gaston-Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: Les d\u00e9buts d'une crise attendue, 1992-1993 (2000), L'Harmattan, page 193 . Acting on behalf of UPADS, Tsaty Mabiala signed the Code of Good Conduct between political parties of the majority and the opposition on 31 May 1997. The Code of Good Conduct was an agreement to disavow political violence, although it proved to be entirely futile, as a civil war broke out a few days later.Joachim Emmanuel Goma- Thethet, \"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed.

Tsaty Mabiala, as spokesman for the United Front of Opposition Parties (FUPO), a coalition of about 20 opposition parties, condemned the preparations for the July 2009 presidential election, saying that \"conditions such as transparency, the revision of lists, and respect for the opposition are not created for this election; it will be neither free nor transparent, and we will contest that.\"\"Congo presidential election on July 12\", Agence France- Presse, 16 May 2009. Speaking in the National Assembly on 8 December 2009, Tsaty Mabiala argued that the government's anti-corruption campaigns were ineffective and that improved legislation to punish corruption was needed.Roger Ngomb\u00e9, \"Les ministres ont r\u00e9pondu aux questions des d\u00e9put\u00e9s\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 9 December 2009 . Speaking to journalists on 29 January 2011, Tsaty Mabiala called on the press to work independently of political pressure and play its part in the development of democracy. He offered a poor assessment of 2010, saying that it had been a year without improvement in the living standards of the Congolese people or progress in democratization across the continent. He also expressed disappointment in the continued predominance of neoliberalism as a global economic system.Roger Ngomb\u00e9, \"Pascal Tsaty Mabiala exhorte les journalistes \u00e0 \u00eatre les acteurs de la d\u00e9mocratie\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 2 February 2011 .

He won the seat in the second round of voting, receiving 62.48% of the vote against an independent candidate, Marcel Koussikina. On 2 November 2012, some UPADS leaders announced that Tsaty Mabiala was suspended from the party for alleged misconduct.Parfait Wilfried Douniama, \"Vie des partis : Pascal Tsaty Mabiala suspendu de l'Union panafricaine pour la d\u00e9mocratie sociale\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 2 November 2012 .

Tsaty Mabiala responded to President Sassou Nguesso's new year's message on 31 December 2013 by saying that Sassou Nguesso needed to address the issue of changing the constitution to allow him to run for another term, something Sassou Nguesso had not mentioned in his message. He urged Sassou Nguesso to quiet the ongoing debate, initiated by the ruling PCT, by affirming that he would not stand again as a presidential candidate in 2016.\" D\u00e9bat sur la constitution : Pascal Tsaty-Mabiala souhaite que le chef de l\u2019Etat apporte des r\u00e9ponses rassurantes et apaisantes\", La Semaine Africaine, 17 January 2014 . In the National Assembly on 25 April 2014, Tsaty Mabiala asked the Minister of Justice, Aim\u00e9 Emmanuel Yoka, a question in which he claimed that it was an \"open secret\" that Sassou Nguesso wanted the constitution to be changed to enable him to run for another term. Alleging that the goal was being pursued through \"shameless manipulation\", Tsaty-Mabiala argued that the government should hold a national dialogue on the matter. Yoka replied that such a dialogue would be unnecessary and that it would be simpler for Parliament to debate the constitution, and he accordingly asked Justin Koumba, the President of the National Assembly, to initiate a parliamentary debate on the matter.Cyr Armel Yabbat-Ngo, \"D\u00e9bat sur le changement de la constitution : Aim\u00e9 Emmanuel Yoka appelle \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat r\u00e9publicain \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e nationale\", La Semaine Africaine, 29 April 2014 .
