    "text": "Empress (Dowager) L\u00fc Zhi (241\u2013180 BC), commonly known as Empress L\u00fc () and formally Empress Gao of Han (), was the empress consort of Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. L\u00fc was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China and paramount power. After Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and Regent during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Emperor Qianshao of Han and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao). Less than a year after Emperor Hui's accession to the throne in 194 BC, L\u00fc had Concubine Qi (one of the late Emperor Gaozu's consorts), whom she deeply hated, put to death in a cruel manner. She also had Concubine Qi's son Liu Ruyi poisoned to death. Emperor Hui was shocked by his mother's cruelty and fell sick for a year, and thereafter no longer became involved in state affairs. L\u00fc dominated the political scene for 15 years until her death in 180 BC and actually ruled as Empress regnant of Han dynasty. == Family background and marriage to Liu Bang == L\u00fc Zhi was born in Shanfu County (\u55ae\u7236; present-day Shan County, Shandong) during the late Qin Dynasty. Her courtesy name was Exu (). To flee from enemies, her father L\u00fc Wen () brought their family to Pei County, settled there, and became a close friend of the county magistrate. Many influential men in town came to visit L\u00fc Wen. Xiao He, then an assistant of the magistrate, was in charge of the seating arrangement and collection of gifts from guests at a banquet in L\u00fc Wen's house, and he announced \"Those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins in gifts shall be seated outside the hall.\" Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), then a minor patrol officer (), went there bringing a single cent and said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\" L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him. Xiao He told L\u00fc Wen that Liu Bang was not serious, but Liu ignored him and chatted with L\u00fc. L\u00fc Wen said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I've never seen someone so exceptional like you before.\" L\u00fc Wen then offered his daughter L\u00fc Zhi's hand in marriage to Liu Bang and they were wed. L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a daughter (later Princess Yuan of Lu) and a son Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han). Liu Bang later participated in the rebellion against the Qin Dynasty under the insurgent Chu kingdom, nominally ruled by King Huai II. L\u00fc Zhi and her two children remained with her father and family for most of the time during this period. == Life during the Chu\u2013Han Contention == A Western Han (202 BC - 8 AD) ceramic statuette of a seated woman and court attendant holding up her robes, from a tomb of Xianyang, Shaanxi province In early 206 BC, after the fall of the Qin Dynasty, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Liu Bang was named \"King of Han\" and given the lands in the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan) as his domain. However, Liu Bang's family, including L\u00fc Zhi and her children, remained in Pei County, which was a territory of Xiang Yu's kingdom of Western Chu. Later that year, Liu Bang attacked and seized the Three Qins (three kingdoms covering the Guanzhong region) directly north of his own fief. Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to an earlier promise by Emperor Yi of Chu (previously known as King Huai II of Chu) to appoint whoever conquered Guanzhong first (during the rebellion against the Qin Dynasty) as king of that area. This marked the beginning of a four-year power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, from 206 BC to 202 BC, known as the Chu\u2013Han Contention. Xiang Yu initially took no action against Liu Bang's family. In the eighth lunar month, Liu Bang sent his followers Wang Xi () and Xue Ou () to meet Wang Ling () in Nanyang and fetch his family. However Xiang Yu mobilised troops to Yangxia () and prevented the Han forces from advancing. In the summer of 205 BC, Liu Bang took advantage of the situation when Xiang Yu was occupied with suppressing rebellions in the Qi kingdom to attack and capture Western Chu's capital Pengcheng. Xiang Yu immediately withdrew from Qi and launched a counterattack, defeating Liu Bang's forces at Suishui (). L\u00fc Zhi and Liu Bang's family were captured by Chu forces and held hostage. During this period of time, L\u00fc Zhi started an illicit affair with Shen Yiji (), one of Liu Bang's followers who was also held captive together with her. In the autumn of 203 BC, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu came to a temporary reconciliation, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into west and east under their Han and Western Chu domains respectively. As part of their agreement, Xiang Yu released L\u00fc Zhi and Liu Bang's family and returned them to Liu. L\u00fc Zhi was given the title of \"Queen Consort of Han\" (). Liu Bang later renounced the truce and attacked Xiang Yu, eventually defeating the latter at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC and unifying China under his rule. Liu Bang proclaimed himself Emperor of China and established the Han Dynasty. He instated L\u00fc Zhi as his empress and their son Liu Ying as crown prince. == As empress and paramount authority== L\u00fc Zhi's jade seal, excavated from Xianyang, now in the Shaanxi History Museum. Even after Emperor Gaozu (Liu Bang)'s victory over Xiang Yu, there were still unstable areas in the empire, requiring the new government to launch military campaigns to pacify these regions thereafter. Gaozu placed Empress L\u00fc Zhi and the crown prince Liu Ying (L\u00fc Zhi's son) in charge of the capital Chang'an and making key decisions in court, assisted by the chancellor Xiao He and other ministers. During this time L\u00fc Zhi proved herself to be a competent administrator in domestic affairs, and she quickly established strong working relationships with many of Gaozu's officials, who admired her for her capability and feared her for her ruthlessness, after the war ended and Emperor Gaozu returned, she remained in power and she was always influential in many of the country's affairs. ===Roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue=== L\u00fc Zhi is known for her roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue, two of Emperor Gaozu's subjects who contributed greatly to the founding of the Han Dynasty, of whose military capabilities both she and her husband had been apprehensive . In 196 BC, Gaozu left the capital Chang'an to suppress a revolt in Julu started by Chen Xi, the Marquis of Yangxia. A year before, Chen Xi met Han Xin before departing from Chang'an for Julu, and it was alleged that Han Xin was involved in the rebellion. L\u00fc Zhi became wary of Han Xin, and after consulting the chancellor Xiao He, she had Xiao summon Han to meet her in Changle Palace. There, the empress had Han Xin taken by surprise, captured and subsequently executed in a torturous manner. L\u00fc Zhi also ordered Han Xin's family and relatives to be put to death as well. When Gaozu was putting down Chen Xi's revolt, he requested reinforcements from Peng Yue but the latter claimed that he was ill and sent his subordinates to assist Gaozu instead. After Chen Xi's rebellion was quelled, Gaozu heard rumours that Peng Yue was plotting against him too, and he had Peng arrested and stripped off his titles. Peng was demoted to the status of a commoner and exiled to the remote Qingyi County (\u9752\u8863\u7e23; in present-day Ya'an, Sichuan). During his journey to Qingyi, Peng Yue encountered L\u00fc Zhi, who wanted to have him killed. He pleaded with her to spare his life and let him return to his hometown in Changyi (\u660c\u9091; present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong), and the empress pretended to agree. Peng Yue was brought to Luoyang, where he was subsequently executed on false charges of treason. L\u00fc Zhi ordered Peng Yue's body to be mutilated and had Peng's clan exterminated as well. ===Dispute over the succession=== In his late years, Emperor Gaozu started favouring one of his younger consorts, Concubine Qi, who bore him a son Liu Ruyi, who was instated as Prince of Zhao in 198 BC, displacing L\u00fc Zhi's son-in-law Zhang Ao (Princess Yuan of Lu's husband). Gaozu had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as crown prince, reasoning that the former was too \"soft-hearted and weak\" and that the latter resembled him more. Since L\u00fc Zhi had strong rapport with many ministers, they generally opposed Gaozu's decision but the emperor seemed bent on deposing Liu Ying. L\u00fc Zhi became worried and she approached Zhang Liang for help, and the latter analysed that Gaozu was changing the succession on grounds of favouritism. Zhang Liang invited the \"Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang\", a group of four reclusive wise men, to persuade Gaozu to change his decision. The four men promised to assist Liu Ying in future if he became emperor, and Gaozu was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support. Gaozu told Concubine Qi, \"I wanted to replace (the crown prince). Now I see that he has the support of those four men; he is fully fledged and difficult to unseat. Empress L\u00fc is really in charge!\"(\u6211\u6b32\u6613\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f7c\u56db\u4eba\u8f14\u4e4b\uff0c\u7fbd\u7ffc\u5df2\u6210\uff0c\u96e3\u52d5\u77e3\u3002\u5442\u540e\u771f\u800c\u4e3b\u77e3\uff01) Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 55, House of the Marquis of Liu. This marked the end of the dispute over the succession and affirmed Liu Ying's role as crown prince. == As empress dowager and Regent== In 195 BC Emperor Gaozu died and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as Emperor Hui of Han. L\u00fc Zhi was honoured by Emperor Hui as empress dowager. She exerted more influence during the reign of her son than she had when she was empress. ===Roles in the deaths of Concubine Qi and Liu Ruyi=== L\u00fc Zhi did not harm most of Gaozu's other consorts and treated them according to rules and customs of the imperial family. For example, consorts who bore male children that were instated as princes were granted the title of \"Princess Dowager\" () in their respective sons' principalities. One exception was Concubine Qi, whom L\u00fc Zhi greatly resented because of the dispute over the succession between Liu Ruyi (Qi's son) and Liu Ying. Liu Ruyi, the Prince of Zhao, was away in his principality, so L\u00fc Zhi targeted Concubine Qi. She had Qi stripped of her position, treated like a convict (head shaved, in stocks, dressed in prison garb) and forced to do hard labour in the form of milling rice. L\u00fc Zhi then summoned Liu Ruyi, who was around the age of 12 then, to Chang'an, intending to kill him together with his mother. However Zhou Chang (), the chancellor in Liu Ruyi's principality, whom L\u00fc Zhi respected because of his stern opposition to Emperor Gaozu's proposal to make Liu Ruyi crown prince, temporarily protected Liu Ruyi from harm by responding to L\u00fc Zhi's order that \"The Prince of Zhao is ill and unfit for travelling over long distances.\" L\u00fc Zhi then ordered Zhou Chang to come to the capital, had him detained, and then summoned Liu Ruyi again. Emperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi by intercepting his half brother before the latter entered Chang'an, and kept Liu Ruyi by his side most of the time. L\u00fc Zhi refrained from carrying out her plans for several months because she feared that she might harm Emperor Hui as well. One morning in the winter of 194 BC, Emperor Hui went for a hunting trip and did not bring Liu Ruyi with him because the latter refused to get out of bed. L\u00fc Zhi's chance arrived, so she sent an assassin to force poisoned wine down Liu Ruyi's throat. The young prince was dead by the time Emperor Hui returned. L\u00fc Zhi then had Concubine Qi killed in an inhumane manner: she had Qi's limbs chopped off, eyes gouged out, ears sliced off, forced her to drink a potion that made her mute, and thrown into a latrine. She called Qi a \"human swine\" (). Several days later, Emperor Hui was taken to view the \"human swine\" and was shocked to learn that it was Concubine Qi. He cried loudly and became ill for a long time. He requested to see his mother and said, \"This is something done not by a human. As the empress dowager's son, I'll never be able to rule the empire.\"(\u6b64\u975e\u4eba\u6240\u70ba\u3002\u81e3\u70ba\u592a\u540e\u5b50\uff0c\u7d42\u4e0d\u80fd\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u3002) Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 9, Biography of Empress Dowager L\u00fc. From then onward Emperor Hui indulged himself in carnal pleasures and ignored state affairs. ===Treatment of Emperor Gaozu's other sons=== Around the winter of 194 BC, Liu Fei, the Prince of Qi, Emperor Gaozu's eldest son born to Lady Cao (), visited Chang'an and he and Emperor Hui attended a banquet hosted by the empress dowager. Emperor Hui honoured Liu Fei as an older half brother and treated the latter respectfully. L\u00fc Zhi felt offended and secretly instructed her servants to pour a cup of poisoned wine for Liu Fei, and then toasted him. Just as Liu Fei was about to drink the wine, Emperor Hui realised his mother's intention and grabbed Liu Fei's cup as if he would drink from it. L\u00fc Zhi immediately jumped up and knocked the cup out of Emperor Hui's hand. Liu Fei then offered to give up an entire commandery from his principality to L\u00fc Zhi's daughter Princess Yuan of Lu, and L\u00fc Zhi accepted and allowed him to leave. L\u00fc Zhi also played a role in the death of another of Gaozu's sons, Liu You, the Prince of Zhao. Liu You married L\u00fc Zhi's niece but was caught having an affair with another woman, so L\u00fc Zhi's niece reported to her aunt that Liu You was plotting a rebellion.Sima Guang. Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 13. L\u00fc Zhi summoned Liu You to Chang'an and had him imprisoned and deprived of food. Liu You was afraid of committing suicide and eventually starved to death, in 181 BC. L\u00fc Zhi then transferred another of Gaozu's sons, Liu Hui, the Prince of Liang, to Zhao, and forced him to marry a daughter of L\u00fc Chan. The L\u00fc clan grabbed the authority of Zhao and oversaw Liu Hui, thus making Liu Hui feel restricted. Princess L\u00fc had a favored concubine of Liu Hui poisoned to death. Liu Hui was distressed and committed suicide in fear in the same year. For the matters above L\u00fc Zhi was criticized for \"having murdered three princes of Zhao\". ===Marriage proposal from Modu=== In 192 BC L\u00fc Zhi received a marriage proposal from the Xiongnu chanyu Modu, who wrote as follows in a letter meant to intimidate and mock her: > I'm a lonesome ruler born in marshes and raised in plains populated by > livestock. I've visited your border numerous times and wanted to tour China. > Your Majesty is now alone and living in solitude. Since both of us are not > happy and have nothing to entertain ourselves, I'm willing to use what I > possess to exchange for what you > lack.(\u5b64\u50e8\u4e4b\u541b\uff0c\u751f\u65bc\u6cae\u6fa4\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9577\u65bc\u5e73\u91ce\u725b\u99ac\u4e4b\u57df\uff0c\u6578\u81f3\u908a\u5883\uff0c\u9858\u6e38\u4e2d\u570b\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u7368\u7acb\uff0c\u5b64\u50e8\u7368\u5c45\u3002\u5169\u4e3b\u4e0d\u6a02\uff0c\u7121\u4ee5\u81ea\u865e\uff0c\u9858\u4ee5\u6240\u6709\uff0c\u6613\u5176\u6240\u7121\u3002) Ban Gu > et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. L\u00fc Zhi was infuriated at the rude proposition, and in a heated court session, her generals advised her to rally an army and exterminate the Xiongnu immediately. As she was about to declare war, an outspoken attendant named Ji Bu pointed out that the Xiongnu army was much more powerful than the Chinese. At Ji Bu's words, the court immediately fell into a fearful silence.Records of the Grand Historian, v. 100, Burton Watson translation page 249 Rethinking her plans, L\u00fc Zhi rejected Modu's proposition humbly, as follows: > Your Lordship does not forget our land and writes a letter to us, we fear. I > retreat to preserve myself. I'm old and frail, I'm losing hair and teeth, > and I struggle to maintain balance when I move. Your Lordship has heard > wrongly, you shouldn't defile yourself. Our people did not offend you, and > should be pardoned. We've two imperial carriages and eight fine steeds, > which we graciously offer to Your > Lordship.(\u55ae\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5fd8\u5f0a\u9091\uff0c\u8cdc\u4e4b\u4ee5\u66f8\uff0c\u5f0a\u9091\u6050\u61fc\u3002\u9000\u800c\u81ea\u5716\uff0c\u5e74\u8001\u6c23\u8870\uff0c\u767c\u9f52\u58ae\u843d\uff0c\u884c\u6b65\u5931\u5ea6\uff0c\u55ae\u4e8e\u904e\u807d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u81ea\u6c61\u3002\u5f0a\u9091\u7121\u7f6a\uff0c\u5b9c\u5728\u898b\u8d66\u3002\u7aca\u6709\u5fa1\u8eca\u4e8c\u4e58\uff0c\u99ac\u4e8c\u99df\uff0c\u4ee5\u5949\u5e38\u99d5\u3002) > Ban Gu et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. However she continued implementing the heqin policy of marrying Han princesses to Xiongnu chieftains and paying tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between both sides.(\u56e0\u737b\u99ac\uff0c\u9042\u548c\u89aa\u3002\u81f3\u5b5d\u6587\u5373\u4f4d\uff0c\u5fa9\u4fee\u548c\u89aa\u3002) Ban Gu et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. ===Emperor Hui's marriage to Empress Zhang Yan=== In 191 BC, at L\u00fc Zhi's insistence, Emperor Hui married his niece Zhang Yan (Princess Yuan of Lu's daughter) and made her empress. They did not have any children. It was alleged that L\u00fc Zhi told Zhang Yan to adopt eight boys and have their mothers killed. There is uncertainty whether these children were Emperor Hui's; the traditional view is that they were not, while modern historians believe that they were born to his concubines. == As grand empress dowager and Acting Emperor== Emperor Hui died in 188 BC and was succeeded by Emperor Qianshao, one of the children Empress Zhang adopted. Now grandmother of the emperor, L\u00fc Zhi retained her title as Empress Dowager and never claimed the title as Grand Empress Dowager. Conventional historians do not consider Emperor Qianshao a true sovereign, so he is usually omitted from the list of emperors of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Gaozu had previously decreed that no non- imperial clan members could become princes (not including the vassal kings), a rule that L\u00fc Zhi herself had a hand in creating. In spite of this, L\u00fc Zhi attempted to install some of her kinsmen as princes. The Right Chancellor Wang Ling () opposed her decision but the Left Chancellor Chen Ping and general Zhou Bo accepted this move. When Wang Ling rebuked Chen Ping and Zhou Bo in private for going against Emperor Gaozu's law, they rationalized that their compliance with the empress dowager's wishes was necessary to protect the empire and the Liu clan. L\u00fc Zhi promoted Wang Ling to the position of Grand Tutor () but the latter claimed that he was ill and declined, so she ordered him to return to his marquisate (Wang Ling held the title of Marquis of Anguo). L\u00fc Zhi then appointed Chen Ping as Right Chancellor and her illicit lover Shen Yiji () as Left Chancellor. L\u00fc Zhi then proceeded to make her kin nobles. Her first step was to install her maternal grandson Zhang Yan (\u5f35\u5043; Princess Yuan of Lu's son, Empress Zhang Yan's brother) as the Prince of Lu. Over the next few years she instated several of her nephews and grandnephews as princes and marquises. In an unprecedented move, in 184 BC, L\u00fc Zhi also granted her younger sister L\u00fc Xu () the title of Marquise of Lingguang, in a separate fief from that of the latter's husband Fan Kuai. Around 184 BC Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not Empress Dowager Zhang Yan's son, and his birth mother was executed by the empress dowager. He remarked that when he grew up he would make Empress Dowager Zhang pay for his mother's death. When L\u00fc Zhi heard about this, she had the young emperor secretly confined in the palace and publicly announced that the emperor was seriously ill and unable to meet anyone. After some time she told the imperial court that Emperor Qianshao was still sick and suffered from psychosis, and was thus incapable of ruling. She then proposed that the emperor be replaced. The court complied with her wish, and Emperor Qianshao was deposed and put to death. He was succeeded by his brother Liu Yi (), who was renamed to Liu Hong (), and was also historically known as Emperor Houshao of Han. Like his predecessor Emperor Qianshao, Liu Hong is generally not regarded as a real monarch, so he is also not included in the list of emperors of the Han Dynasty. == Death == Tomb of Empress L\u00fc in Changling, Xianyang, Shaanxi L\u00fc Zhi died of illness at the age of 61 in 180 BC and was interred in Emperor Gaozu's tomb in Changling (). Near the end of Wang Mang's Xin Dynasty (AD 9 \u2013 AD 23), L\u00fc Zhi's body was desecrated by Chimei rebels when they raided Gaozu's tomb.(\u767c\u6398\u8af8\u9675\uff0c\u53d6\u5176\u5bf6\u8ca8\uff0c\u9042\u6c61\u8fb1\u5442\u540e\u5c4d\u3002) Fan Ye. Book of the Later Han, Biography of Liu Xuanzi. Emperor Guangwu, who restored the Han Dynasty in AD 25, posthumously replaced L\u00fc Zhi as \"Empress Gao\" in Gaozu's temple with another of Gaozu's concubines, Consort Bo. L\u00fc Zhi was enshrined in a separate temple instead. In the aftermath of L\u00fc Zhi's death, her clan members were overthrown from their positions of power and massacred, in an event historically known as the L\u00fc Clan Disturbance. The masterminds of this coup d'\u00e9tat include ministers who previously served Emperor Gaozu, including Chen Ping, Zhou Bo and Guan Ying. Liu Heng, a son of Gaozu and Consort Bo, was installed on the throne as Emperor Wen of Han. ==Family== * Father: L\u00fc Wen (), sometimes referred to as L\u00fc Gong (). In 187 BC he was granted the posthumous title of \"Prince Xuan of L\u00fc\" (). Historian Guo Moruo discovered that he was a descendant of L\u00fc Buwei. * Husband: Liu Bang, Emperor Gaozu of Han. * Children: ** Liu Ying, Emperor Hui of Han. ** Princess Yuan of Lu (), personal name unknown. * Siblings and their descendants: ** L\u00fc Changxu (), older sister. *** L\u00fc Ping (), L\u00fc Changxu's son, Marquis of Fuliu (). ** L\u00fc Ze (), older brother, posthumously known as \"Prince Daowu of L\u00fc\" (). *** L\u00fc Tai (), L\u00fc Ze's son, instated as Prince Su of L\u00fc () in 186 BC. **** L\u00fc Jia (), L\u00fc Tai's son, Prince of L\u00fc (). **** L\u00fc Tong (), L\u00fc Tai's son, instated as Prince of Yan () in 181 BC. **** L\u00fc Pi (), L\u00fc Tai's son, Marquis of Dongping (). *** L\u00fc Chan (), L\u00fc Ze's son, instated as Prince of Liang () in 181 BC. ** L\u00fc Shizhi (), older brother, posthumously known as \"Prince Zhao of Zhao\" (). *** L\u00fc Ze (), L\u00fc Shizhi's son, Marquis of Jiancheng (). *** L\u00fc Zhong (), L\u00fc Shizhi's son, Marquis of Buqi (). *** L\u00fc Lu (), L\u00fc Shizhi's son, instated as Prince of Zhao in 181 BC. ** L\u00fc Xu (), younger sister, Fan Kuai's wife, instated as Marquise of Linguang () in 184 BC. ==See also== * L\u00fc Clan Disturbance * Emperor Hui of Han == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Sima Qian.
