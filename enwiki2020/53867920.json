The series follows the work of a group of police detectives stationed in the Liverpool docks. The series was created by writer Phil Redmond, famed for his work on Channel 4 soap Brookside.Scouse sultan of soap, Andy Beckett, The Independent, 20 May 1995 The series was highly regarded as the BBC's first attempt to rival The Bill, following a similar weekly format to the ITV counterpart. A total of sixteen episodes were broadcast over the course of two series. The programme featured a large ensemble cast, with John Ashton, Rupert Frazer, Geoffrey Leesley, Denis Lill and Brian McCardie leading the cast throughout both series. BBC executives stated that the series would \"look at the way one non-metropolitan, urban police force comes to terms with economic regeneration by reorganising its City Division, in turn creating a separate Inner City Waterfront Division\", and that the series would explore \"aspects of police work not normally featured and disabuse us of the notion that TV crime is always cracked in 50 minutes.\" However, despite initial acclaim, Waterfront Beat was axed after just two series. The series has never officially been released on DVD. ==Cast== * John Ashton as Detective Chief Supt. Don Henderson (Series 1\u20142) * Geoffrey Leesley as Det. Supt.
