The school is located on the corner of U.S. Route 10 and Cardinal Avenue near Neillsville, Wisconsin. The classroom has been restored to its 1939 appearance and is used for school programs. The basement contains an exhibit on the history of rural education in Wisconsin. Constructed in 1915, the schoolhouse operated as a school until 1951 when it closed due to a lack of students. Reed School is a prime example of the estimated 6,000 one room schools that once operated across Wisconsin. The building was restored by former student Gordon Smith and opened as Wisconsin's 10th State Historic Site in 2007. ==References== ==External links== * Reed School Historic Site Category:Defunct schools in Wisconsin Category:Public schools in Wisconsin Category:Wisconsin Historical Society Category:Museums in Clark County, Wisconsin Category:Schools in Clark County, Wisconsin Category:Education museums in the United States Category:School buildings completed in 1915 Category:1915 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Museums established in 2007 ",
