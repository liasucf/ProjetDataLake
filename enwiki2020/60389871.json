He represented Camden County in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1780-1781, as well as ten terms in the senate between 1782 and 1795. He was an active Federalist and delegate to the constitutional conventions of 1788 and 1789. Gregory's first wife was Elizabeth Whedbee (some sources say she was a daughter of Caleb Sawyer). His second wife was Sarah Lamb. His children were William, Isaac, Mary, Sarah, Penelope, and Harriett.
