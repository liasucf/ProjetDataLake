The library plans to publish several volumes of religious and non-religious Sanskrit texts with translations. As per Mishra, he floated the idea of Vande Mataram Library a few days after the petition against the Murty Classical Library of India (MCLI). Mishra said, \"If people are saying Indians are not competent enough to do that [translate Sanskrit], let\u2019s prove it by creating good works, not fighting just like this.\" Mishra is of the opinion that while the MCLI works are high-quality and the translations are good, there are portions where cultural elements are missing. He plans to bring out authentic translations of both secular and non-secular texts in Sanskrit, including the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Gita, the Upanishads and the Vedas. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Scholars from Odisha Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars Category:Pondicherry University alumni ",
