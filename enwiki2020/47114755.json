Senior researcher\" at linkedin.com, 2015 with the thesis entitled \"Paradoxen : een methodologische studie naar vicieuze cirkels in denken en handelen\" (Paradoxes: a methodological study to vicious circles of thought and action). After his graduation Van Dijkum had started his academic career at the Utrecht University, where he became Professor at the Department of Methodology and Statistics.EURO Mini-Conference Graz 2013, at eurominiconferencegraz2013.wordpress.com. He has been director of the NOSMO (Dutch Organization for Methodological Research in the Social Sciences) for about a decades. In 2000 he also founded Sokrates Consultancy and Engineering. Van Dijkum was also Editor-in-Chief of the International Scientific Journal of Methods and Models of Complexity journal.nosmo.nl/isj/, accessed 06.2015 Van Dijkum's research interests are in the field of \"nonlinear modeling, computer simulation, methodology, epistemology of science, and action research health care.\" == Work == === NOSMO === The Dutch Organization for Methodological Research in the Social Sciences (NOSMO) started in the early 1980s as Stichting Nederlandse Organisatie voor Sociaal-Wetenschappelijk Methodologisch Onderzoek (NOSMO).J. A. Boom.. Sociologische gids: Tijdschrift voor sociologie en sociaal onderzoek, Vol. 28 (1982). p. 394. Their initial focus was on qualitative research.Mens en maatschappij, Vol. 67. N.V. Drukkerij \"'T Koggeschip,\", 1992, p. 87. Over the years working groups were created around the following subjects: * Data collection, Instrumentation & Research design * Qualitative Research (formerly SIM) * Longitudinal Models * Nosmo Methodology of Societal Complexity * Simulation & Game * Social Network Analysis, and * Sociocybernetics Notable academics who cooperated in NOSMO beside Van Dijkum were Gerhard van de Bunt, Dorien DeTombe, Stasja Draisma, Frans van Eijnatten, Henk Flap, Joop Hox, Edith de Leeuw, Cora Maas, Gerty Lensvelt-Mulders, Han Oud, Tom Snijders and Fred Wester.NOSMO Methodologendag 2008 at nosmo.nl. One of the offspring of NOSMO is the KWALON platform for qualitative research,kwalon.nl and the journals Journal for the improvement of methodology in applied research and International Scientific Journal of Methods and Models of Complexity. === Complexity science === In his 2013 speech on the EURO Mini- Conference Graz 2013, entitled \"Complexity is more than complicated,\" Van Dijkum stipulated that: > ... social scientists realized in the last decennia, inspired by colleagues > in the natural sciences, that many phenomena in the social world can be > viewed as complex social systems.C. van Dijkum. \"Complexity is more than > complicated. Investigating, simulating and handling complexity: a challenge > for system dynamics,\" in: Leopold-Wildburger, Ulrike, et al., eds. > Proceedings of the EURO Mini-Conference on Collaborative Decision Systems in > Economics and in Complex Societal and Environmental Applications. EWG-DSS, > 2013. And furthermore: > Through systems theory one recognizes that events are interrelated, interact > with each other and make up systems. With dynamic systems theory one > understand that social systems evolve in time, moved by cause-effect > relations between events that can be described mathematically in > differential equations.\" Van Dijkum believed that \"with the idea of \u2018complex social systems\u2019 one comprehend that those differential equations are non linear, reflecting systems that are difficult to follow and predict, just as many phenomena in the world. It is the start of a promising program of research in the social sciences including system dynamics.\" == Selected publications == * Dijkum C. van, Zeeuw G. de & Glanville R. (1998) (Eds.).
