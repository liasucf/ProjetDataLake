    "text": "Shetland Black is a dark purple heritage variety of potato. It comes from the Shetland Islands, and was developed in the Victorian era. The plant grows to a height of about , and is shallow-rooted and thus suitable for container growing. The potato is suitable for roasting, baking or steaming. The potato is fairly small compared with modern cultivars, and when sliced has a purple ring near the edge. Once cooked it has a fluffy floury texture. Its colour derives from the presence of two pigments, peonidin and petunidin, which make up 52% and 38% of the total pigments, respectively. Popular lore has it that the 'Shetland Black' came to the British Isles by way of a stranded Spanish Armada ship, but because it matures early in the season that provenance is disproven. ==References== Category:Potato cultivars Category:Shetland cuisine ",
