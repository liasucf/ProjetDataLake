    "text": "Horace William Brindley Joseph, FBA (28 September 1867 \u2013 13 November 1943), published as H. W. B. Joseph, was a British philosopher, who spent his academic career as a Fellow and Tutor at New College, Oxford. == Biography == === Early life === Horace William Brindley Joseph was born at Chatham, Kent, on 28 September 1867, the eldest surviving son of Alexander Joseph (died 1890), rector of St John's, Chatham, and Honorary Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and his wife, Janet Eleanor n\u00e9e Acworth (died 1917), daughter of George Acworth, a solicitor, and cousin of Sir William Acworth. Joseph attended Allhallows School in Honiton (1877\u201380) and then Winchester College as a scholar (1880\u201386; he went on to win three gold medals there and was a prefect). In 1886 he went up to New College, Oxford, as a scholar and graduated with a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores (classics) in 1890, winning the Junior Greek Testament Prize in 1889 and the Arnold Historical Essay Prize in 1891, the same year he was elected a Fellow of New College and appointed a lecturer in Philosophy.Clement C. J. Webb and C. A. Creffield, \"Joseph, Horace William Brindley (1867\u20131943)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). Retrieved 24 February 2018. === Career === Joseph was appointed a Tutor at New College in 1892 and, when Alfred Robinson died in 1895, he became New College's Senior Philosophy Tutor (he remained in the position until 1932) and Junior Bursar (until 1919). He was also the University of Oxford's Senior Proctor for the 1906\u201307 academic and Public Examiner for Literae Humaniores from 1910 to 1912 and again from 1921 to 1922.\"Joseph, Horace William Brindley\", Who Was Who (online edition; Oxford University Press, December 2007). Retrieved 24 February 2018. His philosophy was \"firmly rooted\" in Plato and Aristotle's and he was the University of Oxford's foremost lecturer on Plato's Republic; nevertheless, in his career he took greatest satisfaction out of his role as a tutor. His first book was An Introduction to Logic (1906; 2nd edition, 1916), and this was followed by The Labour Theory of Value in Karl Marx (1923) and Some Problems in Ethics (1931); in 1930, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). He retired in 1932, when he became a Supernumerary Fellow at New College; he published a collection of his essays, mostly earlier ones, as Essays in Ancient and Modern Philosophy (1935), including his Herbert Spencer Lecture \"The concept of evolution\" (1924), which Clement C. J. Webb and C. A. Creffield in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography consider \"perhaps the most important of his philosophical writings\". Another work, Knowledge and the Good in Plato's Republic, was published in 1948, after Joseph had died, and across his career he had published several important articles in Mind; the journal carried an obituary of him when he died.H. A. Pritchard, \"H. W. B. Joseph, 1867\u20131943\", Mind, vol. 53, no. 210 (1944), pp. 189\u2013191. Retrieved 24 February 2018. In retirement, Joseph continued to teach at New College and also served as a member of Oxford City Council and Chairman of its Education Committee. He lived in College during term, but stayed with his mother during vacations at Holford and then from 1912 at Dinder. In 1919 he married Margaret (died 1926), a daughter of Robert Bridges, but there were no children of their happy union. He established a music scholarship in her memory at his college and, after he died in the Acland Home, Oxford, on 13 November 1943, New College erected a memorial tablet to Joseph and his wife in its cloisters. == Philosophy == According to Clement C.
