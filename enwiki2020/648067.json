    "text": "Mick Doyle (13 October 1941 \u2013 11 May 2004) was an Irish rugby union international player and coach. ==Youth and playing career== Doyle was born in Castleisland, County Kerry, and began playing rugby union at Newbridge College, County Kildare. He went on to study veterinary science at University College Dublin, who he also represented at rugby. He made his Ireland debut against France on 23 January 1965, scoring a try in the game. While representing Ireland he also studied at Cambridge University where he gained a Blue in the 1965 Varsity match against the Oxford University RFC. Doyle also studied at the University of Edinburgh and played club rugby for Edinburgh Wanderers before returning to Ireland. He went on to earn the distinction of never being dropped during his 20-cap international career as a flanker. Doyler, as he was affectionately known, scored the winning try against Wales in 1967, toured Australia with Ireland in 1967 and South Africa with the British and Irish Lions the next year. His last game for Ireland was against Australia in October 1968, when he lined out alongside his brother Tommy. ==Coaching== He coached Leinster to Interprovincial Championship success five times between 1979 and 1983 before he succeeded Willie John McBride as Ireland coach during the 1984\u201385 season. Under Doyle's stewardship, Ireland, in 1985 won the Triple Crown and Five Nations Championship. He led Ireland to the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, but that joy was tinged with sadness as he suffered a heart attack at the opening dinner. He battled illness and adversity and his recovery from a brain problem was chronicled in his book '0.16'. ==Media== After retiring from coaching, Doyle became a TV expert on RT\u00c9 television, starting with the 1991 World Cup, and continuing both on live coverage and their \"Rugby After Dark\" Sunday night highlights programme until having to step down through ill-health in the late-90s. Apart from working in his veterinary practice, he was a still regular rugby contributor on RT\u00c9 Radio One in the later years of his life. Mick Doyle was killed in a car crash in Dungannon on 11 May 2004. ==See also== * Irish Rugby Football Union * Ireland national rugby union team ==References == ==External links== *RT\u00c9 News - Death of Mick Doyle *- Guardian obituary *scrum.com * The Independent obituary Category:1941 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Ireland international rugby union players Category:Irish rugby union coaches Category:Munster Rugby players Category:University College Dublin R.F.C. players Category:Blackrock College RFC players Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Leinster Rugby non-playing staff Category:People from Castleisland Category:Road incident deaths in the Republic of Ireland Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Ireland Category:Cambridge University R.U.F.C. players Category:Irish veterinarians Category:Ireland national rugby union team coaches Category:Edinburgh Wanderers RFC players Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:People educated at Newbridge College Category:Rugby union flankers ",
