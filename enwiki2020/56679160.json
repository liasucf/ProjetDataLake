    "text": "The Eyre Peninsula Tribune is a weekly newspaper published in Cleve, South Australia, founded in late 1910 and published since March 1911. From 1911 to 1950 it was titled Eyre's Peninsula Tribune, reflecting a time when South Australia's peninsulas were referred to using possessives (e.g. Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser). It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. ==History== Eyre's Peninsula Tribune was founded in December 1910, with the first issue released on 10 March 1911. The newspaper was founded in Cowell by Charles Wallace, and after his death in 1912 it was managed by George Wallace, and in 1920 it was sold to E.R. Main. In 1941, during wartime rationing, it subsumed the Kimba Dispatch (2 September 1927 - 9 May 1941), which had been founded as a subsidiary by Main. On Thursday 15 May 1941, a subtitle (with which is incorporated the Kimba \"Dispatch.\") was added, but in January 1951, the title was simplified to Eyre Peninsula Tribune. After Main's death in 1959, the Tribune was taken over by the Port Lincoln Times, who also owned the Areas Express (1959-1960), combining the two under the Tribune title. In 1963, R.C. Braund of the Port Lincoln Times assumed sole control the newspaper, and In 1982 it was taken over by Northern Newspapers Pty Ltd (winning the Ampol Award for the best country newspaper in Australia, with a circulation of under 5,000 the same year). In 1991 it became owned by the New South Wales based Rural Press, formerly a part of Fairfax Media. ==Distribution== Its distribution currently includes Cleve, Arno Bay, Butler, Cowell, Darke Peak, Elbow Hill, Kimba, Koppoio, Lock, Midgee, Port Neil, Rudall, Tumby Bay, Ungarra, Verrar, Wharminda, Yallunda Flat, and it is the oldest continually published newspaper serving the Eyre Peninsula region. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online. == Digitisation== Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1911 to 1950, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service, under the spelling Eyre's Peninsula Tribune. ==References== ==External links== * Eyre Peninsula Tribune website * Category:Newspapers published in South Australia Category:Publications established in 1910 ",
