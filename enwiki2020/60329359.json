    "text": "Joshua T. Vogelstein is an American biomedical engineer. He is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, where he sits at the Center for Imaging Science. Vogelstein also holds joint appointments in the JHU departments of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Neuroscience. He has an appointment in the Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Sciences, and Vogelstein is the director of the Biomedical Data Science focus area for the Johns Hopkins biomedical engineering program. Joshua Vogelstein is also a Steering Committee Member & Associate Member of the Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute, as well as a Visiting Scientist for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Vogelstein's research focuses on understanding how massive biomedical datasets are best analyzed to discover new knowledge about the function of living systems in health and disease, and how this knowledge can be harnessed to provide improved, more affordable health care. One of Vogelstein's current areas of study is connectal coding, an emerging field focusing on the study of how brain structure, rather than brain activity, encodes information; this represents a shift from the traditional study of neural coding. His work focuses largely on big and wide data in neuroscience, focusing on the statistics of brain graphs and connectomics. Joshua Vogelstein also co-founded Gigantum, a platform for creating and collaborating on open-source data. == Education == Vogelstein did his undergraduate studies at Washington University in St. Louis where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2002. From 2003 to 2009 he studied at Johns Hopkins University, where he received his Master of Science in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and a PhD in Neuroscience from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he developed algorithms for spike detection in calcium imaging. ==Career and research== Joshua Vogelstein co-directs NeuroData with Randal Burns, which has created an ecosystem of open-source tools for neuroscientists and hosts a collection of open-source data.. Joshua Vogelstein has been on the advisory board for numerous commercial companies, including Gigantum, Mind-X, and PivotalPath. He was also the Co-Founder of the data science consulting firm d8alab. From 2014-2018, Vogelstein was the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Institute for Computational Medicine. He has also held positions as an Endeavor Scientist at the Child Mind Institute], a Senior Research Scientist for the departments of Statistical Sciences & Mathematics & Neurobiology at Johns Hopkins University, and as Affiliated Faculty at Duke University. Vogelstein has also held the position of Chief Data Scientist at Global Domain Partners, LLC. == References == == External links == * NeuroData website * Joshua Vogelstein's blog * Joshua Vogelstein's personal website Category:Living people Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:McKelvey School of Engineering alumni Category:Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering faculty Category:21st-century American biologists Category:American computer scientists Category:American biomedical engineers Category:Jewish scientists Category:1980 births ",
