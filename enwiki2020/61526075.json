It originally charted in several countries as an album track upon the release of So Much Fun in August 2019, before being released in a remix with an additional feature from fellow American rapper Travis Scott on October 31, 2019, and reaching a new peak of number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100. ==Music video== The music video for the remix was released through Young Thug's official YouTube channel on November 1, 2019. In the video, Young Thug appears as a fireman, and Gunna is shown rapping in a burning house. ===Synopsis=== The video opens with a marching band led by Wheezy, the song's producer, on a gridiron football field. The video then transitions to Young Thug receiving a call help Gunna as he is on fire inside a house. Young Thug puts on his fireman gear and drives a Slime F.D. truck to the scene, and finds Gunna \"calmly writing a note like nothing is happening around him\". As soon as Thug approaches Gunna, the house explodes from the blaze. The scene then cuts to Travis Scott on a gridiron field, where the fire has now reached. Scott is surrounded by a marching band playing the song's instrumental. The blaze eventually hits each of the marching band members, who are lined up to spell out \"Hot\" like the track's cover art. ==Personnel== * Young Thug \u2013 lead vocals, writing * Gunna \u2013 featured vocals, writing * Wheezy \u2013 production ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 119 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 43 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 40 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 474 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 52 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 52 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Gunna (rapper) songs Category:Young Thug songs Category:Travis Scott songs Category:Songs written by Gunna (rapper) Category:Songs written by Young Thug Category:Songs written by Travis Scott Category:Atlantic Records singles ",
