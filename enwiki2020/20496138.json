The two largest power development projects in the country are the 183 megawatt Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station, expected online in 2016, and the 600 megawatt Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station, expected online in 2018. According to a 2012 published report, Uganda was considering the use of nuclear energy for electricity generation. ==Subministries== * State Minister for Minerals, currently Hon.Achieng Sarah Opendi * State Minister for Energy, currently Simon D'Ujanga ==Upcoming projects== It is expected that after Isimba and Karuma come on-line, construction of Ayago Power Station will begin. Uganda is increasingly developing other energy sources besides hydroelectricity, including evaluation of nuclear energy. The energy generated is expected to be used internally through the expansion of electricity access in Uganda from estimated 20 percent in 2016 (about 900,000 subscribers) to 40 percent in 2020 (about 3 million subscribers). Any surplus energy is expected to be sold to neighboring countries including South Sudan and DR Congo. ==Auxiliary institutions and allied agencies== # Electricity Regulatory Authority (Uganda) # Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited # Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited # Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited # Umeme Limited # Rural Electrification Agency # Uganda Energy Credit Capitalisation Company # Petroleum Authority of Uganda # Uganda National Oil Company # Uganda Oil Refinery # Uganda Atomic Energy Council ==See also== *Energy in Uganda *Government of Uganda *Cabinet of Uganda ==References== ==External links== *Status Report On Some of the Major Projects Currently In Development - September 2015 * Website of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development Category:Government ministries of Uganda Category:Energy in Uganda Uganda Category:Organisations based in Kampala ",
