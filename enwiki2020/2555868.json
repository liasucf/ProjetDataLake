    "text": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni (also Ladislau B\u00f6l\u00f6ni; born 11 March 1953) is a Romanian former professional footballer of Hungarian descent and current coach of Greek side Panathinaikos. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was twice named Romanian Footballer of the Year and took part in 484 Divizia A games, the fourth-most appearances in the history of the competition. Internationally, he earned 102 caps with the Romania national team, which ranks him fifth on the country's all-time list, while also scoring 23 goals (sixth highest all-time mark). B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was an integral part of the Steaua Bucure\u0219ti team that won the European Cup in 1986, the only Romanian team (and, along with Red Star Belgrade, one of two Eastern European sides) to have achieved the honour. He is considered one of the best Romanian footballers in history. ==Playing career== ===Club=== Born in T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Romania to a Sz\u00e9kely family from T\u00e2rn\u0103veni, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni's first team was Chimica T\u00e2rn\u0103veni. In 1970, he moved to ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f where he stayed until 1984, when he joined Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, being part of the team which won the European Champions Cup in 1986 (where he missed his penalty in the shootout in the final) and the European Super Cup the following year. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni remained at Steaua until 1987. He won the Universiade gold medal with Romania's students football team in the 1974 edition that was held in France, playing alongside Gheorghe Mul\u021bescu, Dan P\u0103ltini\u0219anu, Romulus Chihaia and Paul Cazan. In 1988, aged 35, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni left the country to play in Belgium at Racing Jet Bruxelles and then in France at US Cr\u00e9teil. He retired from professional football in 1992. On 25 March 2008 he was decorated by the president of Romania, Traian B\u0103sescu with Ordinul \"Meritul Sportiv\" \u2014 (The Order \"The Sportive Merit\") class II for his part in winning the 1986 European Cup Final. ===International=== Playing for the Romanian national team in 1983, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni scored one of his most vital goals ever, in the 1\u20130 win against Italy in a Euro 84 qualification match which eventually proved invaluable to the country's qualification for the tournament. At the finals themselves in France, he played in all three of Romania's games, and scored the equaliser in the 1\u20131 draw with Spain in Saint-Etienne. In total, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni won 102 caps for Romania and scored 23 goals (108/25 including Olympic games qualification).http://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=2233 ==Coaching career== As a football coach, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni started with French club AS Nancy-Lorraine, where he was head coach for several years. He promoted with the team in Ligue 1. In 2000, he was appointed as national team coach, but in the summer of 2001 decided to leave the job. Then he joined Portugal's club Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he won both the Portuguese championship and cup in his first year. He was fired at the end of the next season due to mediocre results. His legacy at Sporting was the introduction of youth team players such as Ricardo Quaresma, Hugo Viana and Cristiano Ronaldo into the senior's team starting lineup. In 2003, he returned to France as manager of Stade Rennais; in 2005, he managed the team to their best position in history (4th in Ligue 1), and a subsequent UEFA Cup qualification. In May 2006, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni signed a two-year contract with AS Monaco but was fired on 23 October for lack of results (Monaco being 19th out of 20 in the league by that date). On 9 June 2008, Belgian team Standard Li\u00e8ge appointed B\u00f6l\u00f6ni as their new manager, as he succeeded Michel Preud'homme, who led the club to their first Belgian First Division title in 25 years (season 2007\u20132008). On 24 May 2009, he won the Belgian First Division title in his first season at Standard (season 2008\u20132009) after playing the championship play-off against Anderlecht. On 10 February 2010, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni resigned from his coaching position at Standard Liege. On 29 May 2010, it was officially announced that B\u00f6l\u00f6ni signed a contract with United Arab Emirates side Al-Wahda.B\u00f6l\u00f6ni appointed as head coach of Al-Wahda On 2 September 2010, Al-Wahda sacked B\u00f6l\u00f6ni, despite the team's 3\u20131 win over Ittihad Kalba. On 2 January 2011, he was hired by RC Lens, on a one-year contract, but he couldn't save the team from relegation. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was immediately released in June, and signed a two-year contract with PAOK on 8 June 2011, following a short negotiation period.\u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf \u039c\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9 (in Greek) ===PAOK=== B\u00f6l\u00f6ni's tenure at PAOK started with two wins against V\u00e5lerenga Fotball for the Third Qualifying Round of 2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League, that brought them against Karpaty Lviv for the Play-off round. PAOK won the first leg at home and drew the second leg, qualifying for the group stage. In a tough group that consisted of Tottenham Hotspur F.C., FC Rubin Kazan and Shamrock Rovers F.C., B\u00f6l\u00f6ni's PAOK managed to qualify undefeated at the first place, winning the game at White Hart Lane on the process, a remarkable feat considering that no Greek team had won at English soil since 1999 when PAOK defeated Arsenal at Highbury. For the round of 32, PAOK faced Udinese Calcio, and although a 0\u20130 draw at the first game in Italy spread optimism, a weakened PAOK side was eliminated off the competition when the home leg ended with a 0\u20133 defeat. All and all, the European presence was positive despite the abrupt end, as PAOK managed 6 wins out of 12 games, with impressive performances and a milestone win against Tottenham. At the home front, PAOK had a turbulent season, as the team managed to finish 3rd in regular season, with 5th being its final position after Play-off. During the season, PAOK won the away games against AEK Athens F.C. and Panathinaikos F.C., marking the end of a winless, 10-year-old tradition against those teams when playing away from home. Team's form was inconsistent though, and the departure \u2013 due to the club's financial difficulties \u2013 of two of the most significant players of the team, Vieirinha and Pablo Contreras didn't help matters. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni had to improvise to cover for the roster's lack of depth, with mixed results. Although the season was not deemed successful, fans didn't put the blame on B\u00f6l\u00f6ni, who had won their hearts with his personality, his results against some major opponents and the team's style of play when on good form. On 25 May 2012 PAOK released B\u00f6l\u00f6ni after a one-year cooperation. ===Coaching in the Middle East=== B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was hired by Qatari club Al Khor on 21 June 2012. On 26 January 2013, in a league match against Qatar SC, he was involved in a controversial incident. He threw a water bottle at a ball boy behind the goal after the boy took the ball, which went out of play, off the pitch. The bottle did not hit the boy, however, it was spotted by the match observer, Ali Al-Naimi, who relayed the information to a referee's assistant who eventually informed the referee, Fahad Jaber, who decided to send him off. Instead of going directly to the stands, he chose to illegally stay within the checkpoint. Security officers attempted to guide him off, but he retorted by using foul language and pushing the police officers. As a result, a police report was filed against him. He was later fined 75,000 Qatari riyals by the QFA and banned for 5 matches. In August 2013, Croatian media speculated that B\u00f6l\u00f6ni might be named the new head coach of Dinamo Zagreb, following the sacking of team's former head coach, Krunoslav Jur\u010di\u0107. B\u00f6l\u00f6ni has previously been linked with Hajduk Split, Dinamo Zagreb's fierce rival, as well.http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/trener-koji-je-otkrio-cristiana-u-dinamu- boloni-je-kanidat-329918 On 21 July 2015, Saudi club Al-Ittihad announced B\u00f6l\u00f6ni as their new coach. ===Royal Antwerp=== On 16 June 2017, B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was announced as the new manager of Belgian club Royal Antwerp. In his first season at the club, he finished 8th place in the regular season, and 3rd place in the Europa League play-off group to keep the team safe from relegation. In his second season, Antwerp was the surprise package of the championship, finishing the regular season on 6th place, and qualifying for the championship play-offs for the first time. Antwerp recorded important victories over Genk (1\u20130), Anderlecht (2\u20131), Gent (2\u20131), Standard Li\u00e8ge (2\u20131), as well as a blank draw with Club Brugge in the first half of the play-off, and climbed on the 3rd place, but later losses to these teams meant Antwerp finished 4th, thus going for the Europa League play-offs final. In the final, Antwerp beat Charleroi 3\u20132 after coming back from 0\u20132 down in the first minutes. Thus, Antwerp secured qualification in the second qualifying round of UEFA Europa League after years of absence from Europe. He also led the team to the Belgian cup final in the 2019\u201320 season, their first since 1992. However, the competition was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===Gent=== On 20 August 2020, Belgian League runners-up K.A.A. Gent announced B\u00f6l\u00f6ni as their new head coach In September, he was sacked after only three games in charge. ===Panathinaikos=== On 19 October 2020, Panathinaikos is expected to announce B\u00f6l\u00f6ni as their new head coach. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- | rowspan=\"15\"|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 | 1970\u201371 | Divizia B | 19 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 19 || 2 |- | 1971\u201372 | rowspan=\"13\"|Divizia A | 27 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 27 || 1 |- | 1972\u201373 | 26 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 26 || 0 |- | 1973\u201374 | 31 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 31 || 3 |- | 1974\u201375 | 24 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 24 || 1 |- | 1975\u201376 | 33 || 4 || 2Two appearances in 1975\u201376 UEFA Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 35 || 4 |- | 1976\u201377 | 33 || 11 || 2Two appearances in 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 35 || 11 |- | 1977\u201378 | 31 || 3 || 2Two appearances in 1977\u201378 UEFA Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 33 || 3 |- | 1978\u201379 | 32 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 32 || 3 |- | 1979\u201380 | 26 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 26 || 6 |- | 1980\u201381 | 31 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 31 || 6 |- | 1981\u201382 | 31 || 10 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 31 || 10 |- | 1982\u201383 | 32 || 7 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 32 || 7 |- | 1983\u201384 | 30 || 7 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 30 || 7 |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Total ! 406 !! 64 !! 6 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0 !! 412 !! 64 |- | rowspan=\"5\"|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti | 1984\u201385 | rowspan=\"4\"|Divizia A | 24 || 3 || 1One appearance in the 1984\u201385 European Cup Winners' Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 25 || 3 |- | 1985\u201386 | 31 || 9 || 9Nine appearances and one goal in the 1985\u201386 European Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 40 || 10 |- | 1986\u201387 | 28 || 10 || 1One appearance and one goal in the 1986\u201387 European Cup || 1 || 1One appearance in 1986 European Super Cup || 0 || 30 || 10 |- | 1987\u201388 | 14 || 2 || 4Four appearances and one goal in the 1987\u201388 European Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 18 || 3 |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Total ! 97 !! 24 !! 15 !! 3 !! 1 !! 0 !! 113 !! 27 |- | Racing Jet Brussels | 1987\u201388 | rowspan=\"1\"|Belgian Pro League | 16 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 16 || 0 |- | Cr\u00e9teil | 1988\u201389 | Ligue 2 | 11 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 11 || 2 |- | rowspan=\"4\"|Orl\u00e9ans | 1989\u201390 | rowspan=\"3\"|Ligue 2 | 32 || 4 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 32 || 4 |- | 1990\u201391 | 27 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 27 || 0 |- | 1991\u201392 | 18 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 18 || 0 |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Total ! 77 !! 4 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0 !! 77 !! 4 |- ! colspan=\"3\"|Career total ! 607 !! 94 !! 21 !! 3 !! 1 !! 0 !! 628 !! 97 |} ===International goals=== Romania in 1984 :Romania's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" |- !colspan=\"7\"|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni - International goals |- ! # !!
