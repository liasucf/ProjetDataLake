It was named by the French 1874 Transit of Venus Expedition to Campbell Island because of its resemblance to a tooth (dent in French). ==Birds== The island is part of the Campbell Island group Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds as well as the endemic Campbell teal and Campbell snipe.BirdLife International.

Downloaded from on 22 January 2012. ===Campbell teal=== The island is most famous for its Campbell teal, which was thought to have been extinct for more than 100 years until a small group was rediscovered there in 1975. Dent Island is free from predators, especially the rats whose introduction on Campbell Island led to the extinction of the teal there. However, the suitable habitat for the teal on Dent Island is much more limited than its area would suggest, because a large area of the island is bare rock. The Campbell teal conservation programme started in 1984 when 4 birds were transferred from Dent Island to the Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre.Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre Campbell Island teal head home, Wairarapa Times-Age, 1 September 2005Campbell Island Teal Release , localeye.info, 1 September 2005 TerraNature.org In 1997, a census carried out on Dent Island showed that its Campbell teal population had declined to dangerous levels with only three birds being found. However the conservation and breeding has been very successful, and in recent years many teals have been reintroduced onto Campbell Island itself, where there is now a population of over a hundred. Rats were eventually eradicated from Campbell Island in 2001. ==See also== * List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands * New Zealand subantarctic islands * Megaherb == References == == External links == * Map of Campbell Island Category:Islands of the Campbell Islands Category:Stacks of New Zealand Category:Important Bird Areas of New Zealand ",
