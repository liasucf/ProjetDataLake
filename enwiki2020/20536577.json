    "text": "\"Someday Never Comes\" is a song by Creedence Clearwater Revival from their album Mardi Gras released in 1972 and written by the frontman John Fogerty. The single reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1972 with Doug Clifford's \"Tearin' up the Country\" released as the B-side. This is the final single released by Creedence Clearwater Revival before they officially broke up in 1972. ==Song meaning== Fogerty has stated that the song is about being left and not being able to learn much as a child. :\"Someday Never Comes\" is simply a song about my parents undergoing a divorce when I was a child and me not knowing many things. When my dad left me, he told me to be a man and someday I would understand everything. Now, I'm here basically repeating the same thing really. I had a son in 1966 and I went away when he was five years old or so and again told him \"someday\" he would understand everything. Really, all kids ask questions like \"Daddy, when are we going fishing?\" and parents always answer with \"someday\", but in reality someday never comes and kids never learn what they're supposed to learn. - John Fogerty 1973 :When I wrote this song, my life was pretty chaotic. I knew my marriage was going to break up. My band was falling apart. I was beginning to sense the darkness that was Fantasy Records. This song was inspired by my parents' divorce when I was a young boy and the effect it had on me. At the time, they told me, \"Someday, you'll understand.\" The truth of this is that you never do and I found myself facing this as a parent. The irony was painful and inescapable. - John Fogerty, liner notes to \"Wrote a Song for Everyone\", Vanguard Records, 2013 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1972 singles Category:Creedence Clearwater Revival songs Category:Songs written by John Fogerty Category:Song recordings produced by John Fogerty Category:1972 songs Category:Fantasy Records singles ",
