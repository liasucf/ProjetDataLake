It was founded in 1990 and initially operated in the western provinces of Afghanistan, it has since branched out to the rest of the country. In early 2002 the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) responded to OMAR's request for specialist training necessary to address the new types of UXO being found in Afghanistan following coalition activity in the area.
