    "text": "The Afrolit Sans Frontieres Festival is a virtual literary festival founded by South African author and curator Zukiswa Wanner as a response to the curfews and lockdowns related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic within the African continent. ==Background== In an interview with the Mail & Guardian, Wanner talked about how the coronavirus epidemic inspired the festival and how she was able to get in touch with all the writers via WhatsApp. Because she had read their books, it was easier for her to pair them to discuss different topic that would not bore the audience.
