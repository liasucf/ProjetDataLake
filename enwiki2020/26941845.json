Lawonn pumped septic systems and had a spare 2,000-gallon vacuum tank he needed to sell, but no effective way to market it. Word-of-mouth and newspaper advertising didn\u2019t seem like the best ways to reach contractors who might be interested in his product. The late John DiVall of Jay\u2019s Waste Equipment advised them that there was a need for an industry trade journal. Taking the advice to heart, Kendall and Lawonn began publication. The first issue of Midwest Pumper was mailed to 2,500 contractors in eight states. Today, Pumper is the flagship magazine for COLE Publishing and COLE Inc.http://www.americanliquidwaste.com/2010/03/uncategorized/the-pumper- cleaner-expo-2010-30th-anniversary-show/ ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Official site Category:Publishing companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Wisconsin Category:Publishing companies established in 1979 Category:Sewerage ",
