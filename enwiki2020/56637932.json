    "text": "Deiveson Alc\u00e2ntara Figueiredo (born December 18, 1987) is a Brazilian mixed martial artist who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, where he is the current UFC Flyweight Champion. As of October 12, 2020, he is #14 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. == Background == Figueiredo was born in the small city of Soure, Para, Brazil where buffaloes roam freely. He was a cowboy, working with his father at an animal farm until he was thirteen years old. He moved to Belem and started training in capoeira at school where he immersed himself for two years. He started training MMA after he met Iuri Marajo at the age of sixteen. == Mixed martial arts career == === Early career === Figueiredo made his professional debut in 2011 and fought primarily in his native country of Brazil. He amassed a record of 11-0 prior to being signed by the UFC. === Ultimate Fighting Championship === Figueiredo made his promotional debut on June 3, 2017 at UFC 212, facing Marco Beltran. He won the fight via technical knockout by corner stoppage after round two. His next fight came on October 28, 2017 at UFC Fight Night: Brunson vs. Machida against Jarred Brooks. He won the fight via split decision. On February 3, 2018 Figueiredo faced Joseph Morales at UFC Fight Night: Machida vs. Anders. He won the fight via technical knockout in round two. Figueiredo faced John Moraga on August 25, 2018 at UFC Fight Night 135. He won the fight via technical knockout 3:08 into the second round. Figueiredo was expected to face Joseph Benavidez on January 19, 2019 at UFC Fight Night 143. However the promotion clarified plans indicating that the pairing was off and that Figueiredo would be rescheduled for a separate event. Figueiredo faced Jussier Formiga on March 23, 2019 at UFC Fight Night 148. He lost the fight via unanimous decision. Figueiredo faced Alexandre Pantoja on July 27, 2019 at UFC 240.

At the weigh-in, Figueiredo weighed at 127.5 pounds, 2.5 pounds over the title fight limit. As a result, Figueiredo forfeited 30 percent of his purse to Benavidez and wasn't eligible to win the UFC Flyweight championship. He won the fight via TKO in round two. Coming into the fight with Benavidez, Figueiredo had to cut 11 kilograms. He reportedly suffered from kidney and stomach pains when his team decided to stop cutting weight. Figueiredo stated he would like to give Joseph Benavidez his rematch because Benavidez gave him the opportunity to fight when he missed weight ahead of their fight. Figueiredo rematched with Joseph Benavidez for the vacant UFC Flyweight Championship at UFC Fight Night 172 on July 19, 2020. On July 11, 2020, Figueiredo tested positive for COVID-19. According to his manager, the bout was not yet officially removed and Figueiredo was administered a second COVID-19 test on July 12, 2020 where the result would be back on July 13, 2020 to determined if Figueiredo was free to fight. Figueiredo passed multiple COVID-19 tests, clearing him to fight in the main event. Figueiredo won the fight via a technical submission in the first round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award. As the first fight of his new six-fight contract with the UFC, Figueiredo was scheduled to make his first title defense against former UFC Bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt on November 21, 2020 at UFC 255.
