    "text": "The Mendenhall River is an Alaskan river north of Juneau in the Mendenhall Valley. The river begins at the Mendenhall Lake, at the base of the Mendenhall Glacier. ==Rafting on the river== The Mendenhall is about six miles (9 kilometers) long, one mile (1.6 km) of which is whitewater. The most favorable months in which to raft on the river is May through September. The most active points along the whitewater section are Scott's Iatola (or Iatolla) Hola, Tourist Trap, and Pinball Alley. The whitewater ends near the Juneau International Airport. ==Flooding== Minor flood stage for the Mendenhall River is 12 feet (3.7 m), and a level of 14 feet (4.3 m) is more likely to cause extensive problems. If the Mendenhall is at minor flood stage, however, it is likely that areas such as Montana Creek, Jordan Creek, and the Mendenhall Lake are also experiencing flooding at that time. ==Interesting facts== *On October 20, 1998, the river reached its greatest-recorded water flow of 12,400 cubic feet per second (350 m\u00b3/s). *Named in honor of Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, the superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (1889-1894). ==Points of interest== *Brotherhood Bridge ==See also== *List of Alaska rivers *Mendenhall Glacier *Mendenhall River Community School *Mendenhall Wetlands State Game Refuge *Thomas Corwin Mendenhall ==External links== *Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Flood Profiles -- (full report is a PDF file) *Facing the \"Iatolla Hola\"\u2014September 4, 2001 article in the on-line version of the Juneau Empire *Mendenhall River on E-RAFT.com *Rafting picture *Juneau areas at risk of floods *Mendenhall Wetlands State Game Refuge Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of Juneau, Alaska ",
