Canter started out riding at the semi-professional level, winning the 2004 Southern Extreme Bull Riding Association (SEBRA) year-end title. Once he turned 18 in June 2005, he bought his PBR permit. He first came on as an alternate in the 2005 PBR World Finals. He won money in 2005 to qualify for the 2006 Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS). His first full season on tour was 2006. He notched his first career win by winning the 2006 BFTS event in Billings, Montana, and that helped him qualify for the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada. He has qualified for the PBR World Finals four times (2006 to 2009). He finished in the top 50 in 2005, 8th in 2006, 11th in 2007 and 25th in 2008. Canter is a left-handed rider who learned to ride from Jerome Davis, one of the original PBR founders, on Davis' ranch in Archdale, North Carolina. He won his first event in Billings, Montana, with a purse over $53,000.00 and he has remained in the top ten throughout the 2006 season. Canter was one of the smaller riders on tour at 5'3\" and 115 pounds. His hobbies include hunting, fishing, wakeboarding, and snowboarding. He was a part of the elite Team Enterprise, a team that included active and former PBR bull riders, as well as entertainer Flint Rasmussen, which lasted from 2006 to 2010. He often traveled with his good friends and fellow PBR riders, J. B. Mauney and Shane Proctor. He makes his home in Randleman, North Carolina. ==References== ==External links== *ProBullStats.com Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Randleman, North Carolina Category:Bull riders ",
