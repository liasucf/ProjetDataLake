    "text": "The Ossetian Military Road (, ) was constructed between 1854 and 1889, by Imperial Russian authorities in the Caucasus. The road runs through the Rioni and Ardon river valleys and links Kutaisi, Georgia with Alagir, Russian Federation, crossing the Greater Caucasus crest through the Mamison Pass (Kutaisi-Alpana-Mamison road) at 2,911m. The 270-km-long route is seldom used today, having been supplanted by the 1971-1981 construction of Trans-Caucasian Highway, which crosses the Caucasus range via Roki Tunnel. Alternative crossings include the Georgian Military Road, which climbs the Jvari Pass at 2379m.
