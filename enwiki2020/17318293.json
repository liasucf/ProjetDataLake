This rural community, formerly known as Mobley Stand, is centered at the intersection of Kentucky Highways 22 and 573.The Rand McNally Road Atlas, 2007 Edition, page 43. Bethlehem is best known for its annual Living Nativity, celebrated on December 22\u201325 from 6:30\u20139:00 pm. The event is a collaborative effort of three local Christian churches (Bethlehem Baptist, Bethlehem Methodist, and Point Pleasant Christian). The Bethlehem post office (ZIP code 40007) offers a special postmark during the Christmas season. Each December, people from many surrounding communities, and occasionally from other states, bring their holiday cards to receive the Bethlehem postmark. In 1996, a segment of the CBS Evening News featured Bethlehem's Christmas traditions. Local and national television and periodicals have also covered this community tradition. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Henry County, Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky Category:Louisville metropolitan area ",
