    "text": "Sideroxylon marginatum is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is endemic to the Cape Verde Islands, where it is a mesophytic species whose habitat is now limited to steep escarpments and inaccessible places. It is threatened by continued habitat loss. ==Distribution== There are records of the species on seven islands in the Cape Verde archipelago \u2013 Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Sal, Boavista, Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, between 500 and 1,200 meters elevation. Its range has decreased from human activity, and it is currently extinct in the wild on S\u00e3o Vicente, Sal and Boavista. ==Species delineation== It was formerly considered a subspecies (marginata) of Sideroxylon mirmulans, which is native to Madeira. Plants of S. mirmulans from the Canary Islands are now considered Sideroxylon canariense. ==References== ==Further reading== marginata Category:Flora of Cape Verde Category:Vulnerable plants ",
