The commune covers an area of and as of 2002 had a population of 76,555 people. ==History== In local tradition Kpase is supposed to have founded the town.Robin Law, Ouidah: The Social History of a West African Slaving 'Port', 2004, p.21 This probably happened towards the end of the sixteenth century.Robin Law, Ouidah: The Social History of a West African Slaving 'Port', 2004, p.24-25 The town was originally known as Gl\u0113xw\u00e9, literally 'Farmhouse', and was part of the Kingdom of Whydah. Ouidah saw its role in international trade rise when the British built a fort here in 1650.national online article on Benin Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 in 1890 Whydah troops pushed their way into the African interior, capturing millions of people through tribal wars, and selling them to the Europeans and Arabs.Ouidah Museum, Benin - \"Depart pour D'Autres 'Ceux', Convoi De negres: homes, femmes et enfants, conduits enchaines par des metis Arabes\" By 1716, when the massive English slave ship Whydah Gally arrived to purchase 500 slaves from King Haffon to sell in Jamaica, the Kingdom of Whydah had become the second largest slave port in the Triangular trade. The Kingdom was ruled by King Haffon, who received his coronation crown as a gift from Portugal, until, in 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah was captured by the forces of King Agaja of Dahomey.Butler, Stuart (2019) Bradt Travel Guide - Benin, pgs. 101-112 On 19 March 1727, the Boston News-Letter gave this report: \"WHYDAH IN AFRICA: the beginning of this month, Agaja the king of Dahomey came down unexpectedly with an army, and soon became master of this place, and the country adjacent Allada; the defoliation which ensued was so great, that it is impossible to be represented! The factory at Saber, once the king's town and Seat of Trade, was burnt to the ground, and in it a great quantity of merchandise. Forty Europeans were carried into captivity, to the King of Dahomey's camp at Ardrah, but after having been detained about 14 days, seven of them were released and are now returning hither; they gave a melancholy account of their treatment. This country, which was the pleasantest in all these parts, is now laid waste by fire and sword, and made a wilderness!\" In 1860, Whydah was the port which sent the last recorded shipment of slaves to the United States, even though that country had prohibited the transatlantic slave trade in 1808. This illegal shipment was aboard the Clotilda and went to Mobile, Alabama.\"Last Slaver from U.S. to Africa. A.D. 1860\": Capt. William Foster, Journal of Clotilda, 1860, Mobile Public Library Digital Collections; accessed 28 January 2018 France captured the town in 1894, by which time the town had declined due to the outlawing of the slave trade. In the time frame of 1946-1949 French government estimates put the population of Ouidah at about 14,600. By then it had a railway. It was a centre for production and trade in palm kernels, palm oil, copra, coffee, manioc, beans, tomatoes and onions. It was also a centre of the fish trade and the manufacture of vegetable oil. It had Catholic, Protestant and Muslim places of worship.Columbia-Lippincott Gazeteer, p. 1408 ===Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1=== The Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 (in English Fort of St John the Baptist of Ouidah) is a small fortress built by the Portuguese in Ouidah on the coast of Dahomey (originally Ajud\u00e1, from Hweda, on the Atlantic coast of modern Benin), reached by the Portuguese in 1580, after which it grew around the slave trade, for which the Slave Coast was already renowned. In 1680 the Portuguese governor of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe was authorized to erect a fort. In 1721, after having been abandoned for some years, it was reconstructed and named S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1. The Fort, built on land given to Portugal by King Haffon of Whydah, remained under Portuguese control from 1721 until 1961. ==Population== The population evolution of Ouidah is as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
