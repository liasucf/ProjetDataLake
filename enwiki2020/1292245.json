    "text": "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man is the first studio album by American rock band the Bob Seger System, released in 1969 (see 1969 in music). The original title was Tales of Lucy Blue, hence the cover art. In the liner notes, Bob Seger says (sarcastically) he later realized Lucy Blue was Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, and so changed the title of the album. He then thanks \"Doctor Fine\" for this realization. (Doctor Fine being the person who made Seger change the album's name.) The original cover design for the album featured the nude figure from Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, but this too was changed for the final release.http://www.segerfile.com/update03.html The title track was also performed on Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band's live album Live Bullet. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;The Bob Seger System * Bob Seger \u2013 guitar, lead vocals, piano, organ * Dan Honaker \u2013 bass, vocals * Pep Perrine \u2013 drums, vocals * Bob Schultz \u2013 organ on \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\" ;Additional personnel * Michael Erlewine \u2013 blues harp on \"Down Home\" * Glenn Frey \u2013 backing vocals and acoustic guitar on \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\" * Penny Lawyer \u2013 backing vocals ==Production== * The Bob Seger System & Punch Andrews * Engineer: Jim Bruzzese * Liner notes: Bob Seger * Front and Back cover illustration (LP) - Lockart ==Charts== Album - Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1969 |align=\"left\"|Pop Albums |align=\"left\"|62 |- |} Singles - Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Single !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1969 |align=\"left\"|\"Ivory\" |align=\"left\"|Pop Singles |align=\"left\"|97 |- |align=\"left\"|1969 |align=\"left\"|\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\" |align=\"left\"|Pop Singles |align=\"left\"|17 |- |} ==References== ==Notes== * Category:Bob Seger albums Category:1969 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Punch Andrews Category:Capitol Records albums ",
