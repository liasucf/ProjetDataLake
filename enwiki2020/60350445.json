    "text": "Daniel Nicholas Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale (born 10 October 1982) is a British hereditary peer and crossbench member of the House of Lords. On 28 February 2017 he succeeded his grandfather, the novelist Nicholas Mosley (who did not use the titles) in the baronetcy and as Baron Ravensdale, a peerage created for his great-great-grandfather George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. One of Ravensdale's great-grandfathers was Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists. Max Mosley, former president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) is a half-brother of his grandfather. Ravensdale became a member of the House of Lords in March 2019, after winning a crossbench hereditary peers' by-election. He is the youngest hereditary peer in the house and was youngest overall until a peerage was given a few months later to Theresa May\u2019s special advisor Stephen Parkinson. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Crossbench hereditary peers Category:Hereditary peers elected under the House of Lords Act Daniel Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield ",
