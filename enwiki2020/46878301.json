Plenum in May 1952 when a new Constitutional Law was proposed. On 13 January 1953 the National Assembly adopted a new Constitutional Law on the Basics of Social and Political Organization of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Federal Governing Organs. The law established a new Federal Executive Council as the executive branch of government. The constituent republics subsequently adopted matching laws. On 5 February 1953 the Parliament of the People's Republic of Croatia adopted the Constitutional Law of the People's Republic of Croatia on the Basics of Social and Political Organization and Republican Governing Organs which created the republic's new Executive Council. The following day the Parliament adopted an enabling law for the new Constitutional Law, and then proceeded to elect the first Executive Council. The Executive Council organized elections to the Parliament, now divided into a Republican Council and a Council of Producers, on 22 November 1953. A joint session of the two newly elected legislative councils elected a new Executive Council on 18 December 1953. Vladimir Bakari\u0107 was replaced by Jakov Bla\u017eevi\u0107 as president of the Executive Council, while he moved to the position of President of the Parliament. === Members === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"text-align: center;\" | Portfolio ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Member ! style=\"text- align: center;\" | Took office ! style=\"text-align: center;\" | Left office ! style=\"text-align: center;\" | Party |- | President | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Vladimir Bakari\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Vice President | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Jakov Bla\u017eevi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Vice President | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Bo\u017eidar Maslari\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Secretary | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Veljko Drakuli\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Anka Berus | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Antun Biber | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Zvonko Brki\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Marijan Cvetkovi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Du\u0161an Dimini\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Franjo Ga\u017ei | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Ante Jurjevi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Ivan Kraja\u010di\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Slavko Komar | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Hinko Krizman | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Vicko Krstulovi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Kata Pejnovi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Mile Po\u010du\u010da | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Nikola Ra\u010dki | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Svetozar Rittig | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Dragutin Saili | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Nikola Sekuli\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Marijan Stilinovi\u0107 | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Mika \u0160piljak | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |- | Member | style=\"background:#ED1C24;\"| | Milo\u0161 \u017danko | 6 February 1953 | 18 December 1953 | SKH |} ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Socialist Republic of Croatia Category:League of Communists of Croatia Category:Cabinets established in 1953 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1953 ",
