    "text": "The Jemseg River Bridge is the name for two different structures currently crossing the Jemseg River in Jemseg, New Brunswick, Canada. The current Jemseg River Bridge is a haunched girder bridge which opened in October 2002 and carries the four-lane Route 2 (Trans-Canada Highway) on a much broader span with considerably less approaching grade from the west. The former Jemseg River Bridge, located approximately downstream from the current bridge, was constructed in the 1960 and carried the two-lane Route 2; it was closed in May 2015 due to safety concerns and the end spans were dismantled in 2016. The original Jemseg River Bridge was built in 1919 as a 3 span steel truss bridge, including a swing span. When dismantled in 1965, one half of the swing span was moved on Penniac Road (the Penniac Road Bridge was rebuilt in 2018 as a modern concrete bridge). The abutments from the original 1919 Jemseg Bridge can still be found approximately under the current Jemseg River Bridge and immediately adjacent to the Jemseg River. ==References== Category:Road bridges in New Brunswick Category:Bridges on the Trans-Canada Highway Category:Transport in Queens County, New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Queens County, New Brunswick Category:Bridges completed in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in New Brunswick ",
