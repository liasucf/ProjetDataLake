    "text": "Phil-Ellena was the stately home of George Washington Carpenter in Germantown, Pennsylvania, now the West Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia. The house was constructed in 1845 and demolished in 1892 during development of the Mount Airy neighborhood. ==History== In 1836 Carpenter purchased over 500 acres of land in Germantown. He subdivided some of the property, but on a 300-acre parcel near what is now the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Pelham Road he constructed his country estate known as Phil-Ellena. Named for his second wife, Ellen, the Greek Revival house was \"one of the most noted homes in the country.\"Some researchers draw a distinction between Phil-Ellena designating the estate and Pelham referring to the house, see Carpenter, a noted scientist, built a Greek temple on the estate to house his collections of specimens. A greenhouse contained his botanical studies, and a 65-foot clock tower signaled the time. After Carpenter's death in 1860, his second wife, Ellen, inherited the estate. When the estate was demolished in 1898, Carpenter's botanical collection was given to the Philadelphia Horticulture Center, and his museum specimens were transferred to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The clock tower was demolished in 1902. Visitors to Phil-Ellena included Thomas Nuttall and John James Audubon. ==East and West Phil Ellena Street and Pelham Road== Two segments of West Phil Ellena Street are included within the boundaries of the former estate, and Germantown Avenue separates West Phil Ellena Street from East Phil Ellena Street. Pelham was an alternative name for Carpenter's house, and Pelham Road runs through the former estate. ==National Register of Historic Places== Within the former boundaries of Phil-Ellena, sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the following: * Daniel Billmeyer House * Malvern Hall * McCallum Manor * Robert M. Hogue House ==References== ==External links== * Mikelberg, A Decorative Analysis of Phil-Ellena, a Greek Revival, Philadelphia Mansion * Carpenter, A Brief Description of Phil-Ellena * Germantown Historical Society Phil-Ellena collection Category:Houses completed in 1844 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1892 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Philadelphia Category:Germantown, Philadelphia Category:Mount Airy, Philadelphia Category:History of Philadelphia Category:Greek Revival houses in Pennsylvania ",
