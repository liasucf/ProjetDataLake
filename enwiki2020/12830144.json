    "text": "Robert Fulke Greville (8 January 1800 \u2013 12 September 1867) was a politician, soldier and landowner of the early Victorian era, the son of Regency courtier Robert Fulke Greville and Louisa, 2nd Countess of Mansfield. Greville stood as a Parliamentary candidate for Pembrokeshire in the general election of 1831, but was defeated, and went to live abroad, embarking on a military career. Returning to Milford Haven in 1853, he took up residence in Castle Hall. He served as High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire for 1854. He made great efforts to have the railway extended to the town of Milford Haven, which had been founded by Sir William Hamilton, aided by his nephew, (Robert's uncle) Charles Francis Greville. He constructed a pier and other facilities to encourage sea traffic with Ireland. He also constructed gasworks and waterworks, eventually running out of money for improvements and dying in debt. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1800 births Category:1867 deaths Category:19th-century Welsh businesspeople Category:Welsh politicians Category:People from Milford Haven Category:High Sheriffs of Pembrokeshire Robert ",
