Domori has its headquarters in None, just outside Turin, Italy and since 2006 has been part of Illy Group. ==History== Domori was founded in 1997 by Gianluca Franzoni. In 1993, after studying Business, Gianluca travelled to Venezuela, where he experimented with varieties and harvests of cocoa in order to preserve the biodiversity and prevent the extinction of the rare cocoa, the criollo. The criollo is grown at the Hacienda San Jos\u00e9 plantation. Domori produces six varieties of criollo, including Puertomar and Puertofino. The company manufactures a chocolate bar of 100% criollo, with no added lecithin or flavourings. In 2012 the Coca-Cola company and Illycaff\u00e8 collaborated to produce a line of cold chocolate drinks. As well as consumer products, Domori also produces chocolate in bulk for use by chocolatiers. In 2015 Domori promoted its cold chocolate drink, Crema Cacao, at the Milan World Expo. ==References== ==External links== * * Bloomberg Category:Italian chocolate companies Category:Food and drink companies established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Italy Category:Companies based in Turin Category:Italian brands Category:Illycaff\u00e8 ",
