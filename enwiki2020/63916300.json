He previously played for the Oregon Ducks. ==Early life and high school career== Walker lived in Bayside Queens, New York until age 11, when his family moved to Sanford, Florida. Due to Walker's height, in 5th grade his father decided to make him play with the 7th and 8th grade AAU Panthers traveling team. As a freshman, Walker played basketball for Seminole High School in Sanford. For his next two years, he transferred to Orlando Christian Prep in Orlando, Florida, where played with five-star recruit Nassir Little and won back-to- back Class 3A state titles and won MVP honors in both championship games. After his junior season, Walker emerged as a top player in his class with his travel team, Each 1 Teach 1. As a senior, he began playing for Oak Ridge High School in Orlando, averaging 15.8 points, 13.8 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game. Walker was named Orlando Sentinel Player of the Year and Class 9A Player of the Year and was the runner-up to Vernon Carey Jr. for the Florida Mr. Basketball award. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic in April 2019. ===Recruiting=== Walker was heavily recruited by most of NCAA\u2019s top schools after back to back state championships and a breakout summer with E1T1 Elite. On November 21, 2018, Walker committed to play college basketball for Oregon over his other top offers, LSU and Miami (Florida). He was considered a five-star recruit by ESPN and Rivals and a four-star recruit by 247Sports. ==College career== ===Oregon=== On December 7, 2019, Walker made his first career start, due to a leg injury to Shakur Juiston, and scored a freshman season-high 18 points in an 89\u201364 win over Hawaii.
