    "text": "TMEM267 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TMEM267 gene. It is a possible oncogene which encodes a transmembrane protein. The function of TMEM267 most likely involves transportation of molecules from the cytosol, as the presence of motifs and domains involved in transportation were conserved in orthologs. TMEM267 has orthologs in many species and is expressed at highest levels in the thyroid.

TMEM267 was one of ten genes selected using the two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney analysis of training data on atopic dermatitis (a skin disease characterized by areas of severe itching, redness, scaling, and loss of the surface of the skin), as a gene that provided the most information about the separation between the control and experimental groups.Tadesse, Dawit.

TMEM267 is mentioned in articles pertaining to the down-regulation of two miRNAs, one of which is involved in regulating a wide variety of cellular functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation, all of which are vital for the normal development of heart cells.Han, S., Wang, W., Duan, L., Hou, Z., Zeng, J., Li, L., \u2026 Jiang, L.

TMEM267 was affected by increased levels of the NUDT21 gene, and was identified as a part of a large group of possible oncogenes, that when the 3'-UTR is shortened, can cause uncontrollable cell growth.Xiong, M., Chen, L., Zhou, L., Ding, Y., Kazobinka, G., Chen, Z., & Hou, T.

PLoS ONE 14(7): e0218989. TMEM267 was shown to be one of 26 over-expressed genes on chromosome 5p, meaning it belongs to a group of genes which likely provides cancer cells with advantages in growth and invasion of surrounding cells.Scotto, L., Narayan, G., Nandula, S.V. et al. Integrative genomics analysis of chromosome 5p gain in cervical cancer reveals target over- expressed genes, including Drosha. Mol Cancer 7, 58 (2008). In addition, researchers from The Johns Hopkins University filed a patent for 63 genes, including TMEM267 which had increased expression in the presence of HMGA1 protein compared to the control group, which they think could be of use in a method of inhibiting cancer stem cells with HMGA1 inhibitors.Google Patents == References == Category:Genes on human chromosome 5 ",
