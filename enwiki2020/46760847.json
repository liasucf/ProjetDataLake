    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau (30 April 1919 - 9 April 2012) was a French far right journalist and author who was a leading figure in Ordre Nouveau, the National Front and the Party of New Forces. ==Early years== Brigneau was born in Concarneau;Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 303 his birth name was Well Emmanuel Allot.Alice Kaplan, The Collaborator: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach, University of Chicago Press, 2014, p. 286 His father, a teacher, was known for his socialism and pacifism.Brigneau, dernier linceul de l'extr\u00eame droite mar\u00e9chaliste He joined the Milice towards the end of the occupation and was imprisoned at Fresnes as a consequence. He shared a cell with Robert Brasillach shortly before the latter's execution and became an impassioned defender of Vichy France following his release.Richard Golsan, The Papon Affair: Memory and Justice on Trial, Routledge, 2012, p. 81 Around this time he married Georges Suarez's niece. Brigneau's first political party involvement came in December 1945 when he joined the newly established Republican Party of Liberty, a largely conservative group that nonetheless attracted several former collaborators to its ranks. He also wrote for France- Dimanche in the immediate post-war era under the pseudonym Julien Guernec. Under this name he would also write for Rivarol, whilst he used various names to write for the likes of Paroles Fran\u00e7aises, Le Rouge et le Noir and L'independance Fran\u00e7aises and later for Le Courrier de Clan, Roger Holeindre's Le Cointre Poson and the eponymous La Chronique de Jean Brigneau. In the early 1960s he became most associated with the weekly Minute, initially as an editorial writer and then as editor-in-chief. Brigneau also wrote fiction and as a crime novelist won the Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re in 1954 for his novel La Beaut\u00e9 qui meurt. Guide des Prix litt\u00e9raires, online ed. Le Rayon du Polar. Synopsis of French prizes rewarding French and international crime literature, with lists of laureates for each Prize. Grand Prix de litt\u00e9rature polici\u00e8re: p. 36. ==Front National== During the 1960s he wrote strongly in support of Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, playing a leading role in promoting his campaign for the Presidency in 1965. He subsequently became a founder member of Ordre Nouveau (ON), assuming a leading role within the group. He belonged to the more moderate tendency within the ON which sought to distance far right nationalism from the earlier strains of fascism, in contrast to the likes of Fran\u00e7ois Duprat who sought to emphasise fascist continuity.Roger Eatwell, fascism: A History, Random House, 2011, p. 315 Within the ON Brigneau advocated a united front between different strands of the French far right.Andr\u00e9 Gingrich, Marcus Banks, Neo-nationalism in Europe and Beyond: Perspectives from Social Anthropology, Berghahn Books, 2006, pp. 178-179 To this end he became a founder member of the Front National (FN) in 1972 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the 1973 legislative election in Hauts-de-Seine. He was the first secretary-general of the movement and also served as vice-president. Brigneau however soon clashed with Jean-Marie Le Pen, who he felt was too personally ambitious, and in June 1973 he split from the FN to become part of the dissident Faire Front group. In November 1974 this group, which had not been formalised but rather was a loose collection of leading ex-FN dissidents, was reconstituted as a political under the name Parti des forces nouvelles (PFN), with Brigneau taking a leading role in this group. He spent several years within the PFN as a member of its political bureau before resigning in 1981 after reassessing his position on Le Pen, whom he came to view as a \"Breton genius\" and an \"inspired prophet\". Around this time he also broke off his association with Minute, moving to Le Pr\u00e9sent, a Catholic integrist journal to which he contributed anti-Semitic articles under the pseudonym Mathilde Cruz. He was removed from this position in late 1986 after the journal moderated its approach by de-emphasising attacks on the Jews.Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Maol\u00e1in, The Radical Right: A World Directory, Longman, 1987, p. 104 ==Later activity== Brigneau would subsequently write for National-Hebdo, his regular column \"Le Journal d'un Homme Libre\" largely focusing on the same anti-Semitic themes that had dominated his work for Le Pr\u00e9sent, with a particular focus on conspiracy theories and the activities of B'nai B'rith.Harvey Gerald Simmons, The French National Front: The Extremist Challenge To Democracy, Westview Press, 1996, p. 125 Although no longer a member of the FN his column also offered the party unwavering support. He would later become associated with Bruno M\u00e9gret and in 1998 lent his support to the National Republican Movement, a splinter group of the FN that M\u00e9gret established following a bitter split from Le Pen. Brigneau died in 2012 aged 92. He was buried in Saint-Cloud with no representative of the FN in attendance at his funeral. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2012 deaths Category:French journalists Category:National Rally (France) politicians Category:Party of New Forces politicians Category:People from Concarneau Category:French crime fiction writers Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th-century French male writers Category:Breton writers Category:French male non-fiction writers ",
