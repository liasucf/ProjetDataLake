    "text": "The Hotel Bethlehem, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is a 125-room hotel that is a member of the Historic Hotels of America. Also known as Historic Hotel Bethlehem, it dates from 1922 and is Beaux Arts in style. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of a historic district, presumably the Central Bethlehem Historic District which includes 165 contributing buildings. It replaced a hotel that was converted from a general store in 1822. ==History== Hotel Bethlehem replaced a hotel that opened in 1822 in a building formerly housing the 1794 general store, and was known as The Golden Eagle, later The Eagle, after a mural by Peter Grosh on the facade. This first hotel was remodeled in the 1870s but in 1920 was demolished for replacement with a more modern and more fireproof structure. The Bethlehem Hotel Corporation built the new Bethlehem Hotel starting in 1921, with funding from Charles M. Schwab and others at Bethlehem Steel, and it was opened in 1922. The Pioneer Tap Room is decorated with 1937 murals on the history of Bethlehem by military artist George Gray, part of a series commissioned by General J. Leslie Kinkaid, president of then-owner American Hotels Corporation. The former solarium, now a restaurant, has original Moravian tile. After the closure of Bethlehem Steel in the 1990s, the hotel stood vacant and there were plans to convert it into a combination of facilities for the elderly and a women's dormitory for Moravian College. A group of local investors bought it and renovated it extensively in the late 1990s. In 2019 the Bethlehem Hotel came third in the USA Today 10 Best Historic Hotels poll. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Hotels in Pennsylvania Category:Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1922 Category:Hotels established in 1922 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1922 ",
