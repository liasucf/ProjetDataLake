    "text": "William King is an 1878 marble sculpture depicting Maine's first governor of the same name by Franklin Simmons, installed in the United States Capitol, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. It is one of two statues donated by the state of Maine.Architect of the Capitol Under the Direction of the Joint Committee on the Library, Compilation of Works of Art and Other Objects in the United States Capitol, United States Government Printing Office, Washington 1965 p. 211 The statue was accepted in the collection by Senator Hannibal Hamlin (who himself became the subject of Maine's second entry to the Collection) and Senator James G. Blaine on January 22, 1878 who rhapsodized upon the occasion, \u201cHe restrained the wrath of the impudent, quickened the zeal of the laggard, dissipated the fears of the doubting and molded his adherents and followers into a compact, cooperative, effective force . . . . He, more than any other man created the State of Maine.\u201d Murdock, Myrtle Chaney, National Statuary Hall in the Nation\u2019s Capitol, Monumental Press, Inc., Washington, D.C., 1955 pp. 82\u201383 The work is one of the few in the Collection done in an overtly neo-classical style, with King's cloak serving as much as a toga as anything else. Simmons, upon being commissioned to create a Roger Williams statue for Rhode Island moved to Rome where both good marble and good assistants were cheaply found, then moved there permanently so his King statue would have been made there. Sculptor and critic Lorado Taft found the King statue \u201cwell poised\u201d but \u201cwith little vivacity or charm of modeling.\u201d He then notes the severe treatment of the drapery.\u201dTaft, Lorado, History of American Sculpture, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1903, revised with new matter, 1925, p. 248 ==See also== * 1878 in art ==References== ==External links== * Category:1878 establishments in Washington, D.C.
