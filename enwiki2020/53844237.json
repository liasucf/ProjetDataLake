He earned his bachelor's (1973) and master's (1974) degrees from the University of Scranton and his PhD in physics from Dartmouth College (1979). He was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after they were nominated by their Division of Plasma Physics in 2007, for fundamental studies of radio-frequency heating and plasma-wall interactions, including the first observation of Alfv\u00e9n wave heating in a tokamak, the first demonstration of mode-conversion current drive, and pioneering work in the use of liquid lithium as a plasma-facing component. == References == Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American Physical Society Category:American physicists Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:American people of Polish descent Category:People from Scranton, Pennsylvania Category:University of Scranton alumni Category:Dartmouth College alumni ",
