    "text": "The 2020 CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship will be the 7th edition of the CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship, the biennial international youth football championship organised by CONCACAF for the women's under-17 national teams of the North, Central American and Caribbean region. The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Mexico between 18 April and 3 May 2020. However, on 19 March 2020, CONCACAF announced the decision to postpone the tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the new dates of the tournament to be confirmed later. The final tournament is expanded from eight to 20 teams, using the same format as the 2019 CONCACAF U-17 Championship. The top three teams of the tournament will qualify for the 2021 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup (originally 2020 but postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic) in India as the CONCACAF representatives. United States are the defending champions. ==Qualified teams== The qualifying format has changed since the 2018 edition, and the teams are no longer divided into regional zones. The 41 CONCACAF teams were ranked based on the CONCACAF Women's Under-17 Ranking as of 2018. A total of 32 teams entered the tournament. The highest-ranked 16 entrants were exempt from qualifying and advanced directly to the group stage of the final tournament, while the lowest-ranked 16 entrants had to participate in the qualifying stage, where the four group winners advanced to the round of 16 of the knockout stage of the final tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
