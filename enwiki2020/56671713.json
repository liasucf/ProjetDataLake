    "text": "The J.O. Ranch Rural Historic Landscape is a historic area that incorporates the J.O. Ranch, established in 1885 in Carbon County, Wyoming. The ranch operated under the Spanish tradition of low-altitude winter ranch and high- altitude summer range. The ranching operation expanded greatly after the hard winter of 1886-87 devastated the cattle ranching industry in the area. Ranch buildings date from about 1890. Construction is log and stone, with many well- preserved structures. The J.O. Ranch has continued as a working ranch since its establishment. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in on November 22, 2010. ==References== ==External links== * JO Ranch at the National Park Service weekly update * JO Ranch at Historicorps * JO Ranch Rural Historic Landscape at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carbon County, Wyoming Category:Ranches in Wyoming ",
