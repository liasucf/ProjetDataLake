It was also released in MP3 format in 1999 through eMusic, making it the first archival recording released officially online. The show was later made available when Phish launched its LivePhish website and is currently available exclusively through that site. This archival release is also believed to have been the 1st ever commercially download release of a full, live concert by any band. This was the 1st Phish Halloween show to take place outside Vermont, and although this is a Halloween show, it does not feature Phish donning a \"Musical Costume\", as they later would do 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2018. The show was part of 5 day tour through Colorado, a state where the band would tour often in the early yearshttp://phishthoughts.com/tag/1990/ It was an all-ages show on the campus of Colorado College. The tickets for the show indicated \u201cCostume Required\u201d. Keyboardist, Page McConnell's costume consisted of pumpkin-shaped glasses and an orange shirt.
