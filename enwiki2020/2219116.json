It broadcasts to Latin America, Western Sahara, Equatorial Guinea, Americas and the Philippines, in which most of the Hispanic-speaking people are located. Several news bulletins are provided during the day, covering a mixed Spanish and International agenda. Telediario is a bulletin produced for and also broadcast in Spain, simulcast on the international station. However, editions of Telediario Internacional are also produced specially for the channel. A daily showbiz magazine, Gente, is broadcast nightly at 7pm GMT. A limited number of advertisements are shown on the channel. More usually, network commercial breaks on programmes broadcast live in Spain are covered with a clock and short information films about Spain and its wildlife, although sometimes the advertisements are shown. ==History== TVE International began its test broadcasts on December 1, 1989 and officially on December 1, 1990.
