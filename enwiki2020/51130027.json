The suddenly powerless superhero quickly realizes that the only way he can regain his former powers is to team up with the boy\u2014a dream come true for Joey, but not so much for Captain Atomic. Together, the two form an unlikely and awkward partnership that allows them to become the city's newest superhero duo\u2014Atomic Puppet and Nuclear Boy. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Joseph \"Joey\" Felt/Nuclear Boy (voiced by Eric Bauza) \u2013 The main protagonist of the series, a 12-year-old middle-school student and comic book fan. Through a chance turn of events, he develops the ability to combine with his superhero idol and together they form a new hero, Atomic Puppet and Nuclear Boy. * Captain Atomic/Atomic Puppet/AP (voiced by Eric Bauza) \u2013 Captain Atomic was a world-renowned superhero who lived his life being able to handle situations with his brute strength and endless charm. Blinded by success and fame, he's suddenly transformed into a powerless living sock puppet by his jealous sidekick Mookie. Now he goes by the name AP and, due to his massive ego and short temper, struggles with adjusting to his new life as a puppet and the fact that he can only access his former powers when Joey places him on his hand, turning them into Atomic Puppet and Nuclear Boy. ===Supporting=== * Pauline Bell (voiced by Lisa Norton) \u2013 A sassy middle school girl who is Joey's best friend and the only person other than Mookie and the other superheroes that knows of Joey's secret identity. Pauline occasionally covers for Joey when he needs an excuse to become Atomic Puppet and has fought alongside Atomic Puppet if the situation called for it. She has a job at a comic book shop owned by her uncle. * Phil Felt (voiced by Carlos D\u00edaz) \u2013 Joey's burly, rugged, no-nonsense father. He's impatient, opinionated and does everything he can to counteract his wife's babying of the kids. * Vivian Felt (voiced by Kristina Nicoll) \u2013 Joey's sweet but overly caring mother. She worries far too much about her children and is always concerned about what kind of trouble they could get into. * Abigail Felt (voiced by Katie Griffin) \u2013 Joey's energetic 8-year-old sister who goes by the nickname \"Abs\" or \"Abbie\" * Bubbles \u2013 The slow-witted, overweight, and flatulent family cat.

Mookie is Captain Atomic's bitter and envious former sidekick and is responsible for his transformation into a puppet, done in an attempt to replace him as Mega City's protector. While Mookie does have a wide assortment of gadgets to use, by himself, he's nothing more than a glory hound that lives in his mother's basement.

Afterwards, she marries a mysterious alien entity and is transformed into a green-skinned telepath named Queen Mindbender. ===Heroes=== * Justice Alliance \u2013 A superhero team that protects the galaxy at large. Prior to his transformation, Captain Atomic was a member, and he has rejoined as Atomic Puppet. ** Commander Cavalier (voiced by Rob Tinkler) \u2013 A Superman-like hero with heat vision powers. He is extremely obsessed with his appearance to the point where showing him a mirror will always cause him to stop and admire himself much like the arrogance of Booster Gold. ** Robo-Ron (voiced by Martin Roach) \u2013 The Cyborg (comics) superhero who only speaks in beatbox and printed messages. Although he possesses a wide range of gadgetry and is incredibly intelligent, he is considered the least powerful member of the alliance. He also carries some weapons like Robocop. ** Crimson Beacon \u2013 A mute superhero with flaming hair. He has the same powers as Green Lantern and Firestorm (comics). * Princess War Tickle (voiced by Kristina Nicoll) \u2013 A superheroine similar to Wonder Woman who dwells in a magical castle in the sky.
