    "text": "The British-Israel-World Federation, also known as the British-Israel World Federation was founded in London on 3 July 1919, although its roots can be traced back to the 19th century. == Background == In the 19th century, much of the British Israel movement was made up of smaller, localized associations. In 1919, some 80 independent associations throughout the British Isles, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and the United States joined into the British-Israel-World Federation. The main patron of this movement was Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone. She attended the federation's first Congress in July 1920, and remained a patron of the BIWF until her death in 1981. One of its founders was Reuben H. Sawyer, a clergyman in Portland Oregon where he was involved in setting up an Anglo-Israelism group and as leader of the Oregon Ku Klux Klan. He spoke to the Federation's first conference in 1920. Sawyer's supremacist views were influential in the development of the anti-semitic Christian Identity movement out of the philo-semitic British Israelism. William Pascoe Goard was involved in early negotiations of developing the BIWF, and became vice president of the organization in 1921. In 1922, Goard founded Covenant Publishing, the BIWF's publishing company. He also became the first editor of The National Message. The National Message was published until 1981. The federation now publishes The Covenant Nations magazine. From 1924, the organization maintained an office next to Buckingham Palace. In 1990, it moved to Putney on the Thames, but since 2003 has been based near Bishop Auckland in Co Durham. ==Beliefs== British Israelism (also called Anglo-Israelism) states that people of Western Europe descent, particularly those in Great Britain, are the direct lineal descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. The doctrine often includes the tenet that the British Royal Family is directly descended from the line of King David.\"Beliefs of the Orange Street Church\", a British-Israelite churchThe British-Israel-World Federation \u2013 Beliefs The central tenets of British Israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern genetic, archaeological, ethnological, and linguistics and philological research.Harry Ostrer (2012).
