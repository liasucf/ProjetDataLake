As his confidence grew, he moved further afield to bigger mountains and his first Munro was Ben Lomond. For a number of years McNeish worked for the Scottish Youth Hostels Association as a warden and for a period ran the busy hostel at Aviemore, in his early years he also worked as a ski and climbing instructor. 1978 saw the publication of his first book, \"Highland Ways\" which was about backpacking in Scotland. In 1982 he started a weekly outdoor column in his local newspaper the Strathspey and Badenoch Herald called \"McNeish at Large\" and in the same year co-founded the outdoor magazine Footloose with two colleagues. ==In the media== In 1985, he became editor of Climber and Rambler magazine, leaving in 1991 to become editor of TGO Magazine (formerly The Great Outdoors). Since 2010, he has been editor-at-large of TGO Magazine giving him more time to work on other projects. In 1999 he became outdoor correspondent of the Sunday Herald writing the weekly Peak Practice column. Throughout the late 1980s, McNeish contributed and wrote regularly for outdoor programmes on BBC Radio Scotland, in 1991 he scripted and hosted The Munro Challenge for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 100 years of the Munro Tables. During this time Cameron was still writing books and the immensely popular The Munros Almanac and The Munros: Scotland\u2019s Highest Mountains were released in the 1990s. In 1994, McNeish moved into television, presenting the BAFTA- winning The Edge: One Hundred Years of Scottish Mountaineering and in the same year The Great Outdoors, a six-part series for Channel 4. His best known television work is the Wilderness Walks programmes that he made for BBC Two: the first series was broadcast in 1997 and the second in 1998. McNeish was a consultant and guest on the 2007 series Mountain. In the first programme he guides series presenter Griff Rhys Jones to the summit of Scotland's most northerly Munro, Ben Hope, in a snowstorm. He is also a regular contributor to the BBC Scotland series, The Adventure Show. After a break of a number of years from book writing, McNeish released \"The Sutherland Trail: A Journey Through Scotland's North-west\" in August 2009 in conjunction with award- winning photographer and film maker Richard Else. The book is a description of a week-long walking route through Sutherland, in the far north-west of Scotland. That book was followed by others co-authored with Richard Else - The Skye Trail and Scotland End to End. In 2018 Cameron produced an autobiography, There's Always the Hills, published by Sandstone Press.
