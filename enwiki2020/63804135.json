Instead, there was an exhibition game matching the USA national team against a WNBA All-Star team, with Team USA winning 99\u201372 at Mohegan Sun Arena. And as previously mentioned, no games were held at all in 2012 and 2016 due to the Summer Olympic games. ==2000s== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%\" |width=\"40\" | Year |width=\"40\" |Network |width=\"110\" |Play-by-play |width=\"110\" |Color commentator(s) |width=\"110\" |Sideline reporter(s) |width=\"110\" |Studio host |width=\"110\" |Studio analyst |- |2009 |ABC |Dave Pasch |Nancy Lieberman and Carolyn Peck |Heather Cox and Rebecca Lobo |- |2007 |ABC |Dave Pasch |Doris Burke |Heather Cox and Rebecca Lobo |Linda Cohn |Nancy Lieberman |- |2006 |ESPN |Dave Pasch |Doris Burke |Heather Cox |Linda Cohn |- |2005 |ABC |Terry Gannon |Doris Burke |Rebecca Lobo |Pam Ward |- |2004 |ESPN |Terry Gannon |Ann Meyers and Greg Anthony |Doris Burke |Pam Ward |- |2003 |ABC |Mark Jones |Ann Meyers |Doris Burke and Lea B.

The new television deal runs from 2009 to 2016. A minimum of 18 games will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 each season; the rights to broadcast the first regular-season game and the All-Star Game are held by ABC. Additionally, a minimum of 11 postseason games will be broadcast on any of the three stations. Along with this deal, came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, \"millions and millions of dollars\" will be \"dispersed to the league's teams\". *In 2004, the game was not played in its usual format due to the WNBA players competing in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. That year, the USA national team defeated a team of WNBA All-Stars 74-58 at Radio City Music Hall. This game is officially considered to be an exhibition rather than an All-Star Game. The league also took a month-long break to accommodate players and coaches who would be participating in the summer games. The tradition of not playing the WNBA All-Star Game during an Olympic year has continued in 2008, 2012, and 2016 (along with the tradition of taking a month-long break during the regular season.) ==1999== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%\" |width=\"40\" | Year |width=\"40\" |Network |width=\"110\" |Play-by-play |width=\"110\" |Color commentator |width=\"110\" |Sideline reporter(s) |width=\"110\" |Studio host |width=\"110\" |Studio analyst |- |1999 |ESPN |Robin Roberts |Pat Summitt |Jay Bilas and Tiffany Wright |John Saunders |Nancy Lieberman |} ==See also== *List of WNBA Finals broadcasters *List of current Women's National Basketball Association broadcasters *List of NBA All-Star Game broadcasters ==References== ==External links== *And They Say It Gets Colder: WNBA All-Stars Low on ABC *Episode List: WNBA All-Star Game - TV Tango Category:ABC Sports Category:ESPN announcers All-Star Game All-Star Game ",
