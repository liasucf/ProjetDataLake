    "text": "Nick Carter-Killmaster is a series of spy adventures published from 1964 until 1990, first by Award Books, then by Ace Books, and finally by Jove Books. At least 261 novels were published. The character is an update of a pulp fiction private detective named Nick Carter, first published in 1886. No actual author is credited for the books, with the Nick Carter name being used as a house pseudonym. Volumes varied between first-person and third-person narratives. Authors known to have contributed entries in the series are Michael Avallone, Valerie Moolman, Manning Lee Stokes, Dennis Lynds, Gayle Lynds, Robert J. Randisi, David Hagberg, and Martin Cruz Smith. The name Nick Carter was acknowledged by the series as having been inspired by the early 20th century pulp fiction detective of the same name in the 100th Killmaster volume (labelled Nick Carter 100) which included an essay on the earlier Nick Carter and included a Nick Carter detective short story alongside a Killmaster adventure. The title character of the series serves as Agent N3 of AXE, a fictional spy agency for the United States government. The novels are similar to the literary James Bond novels\u2014low on gadgets, high on action. Sexual encounters in particular are described in detail. ==The character== The definitive description of Nicholas J. Huntington Carter is given in the first novel in the series, Run, Spy, Run. Carter is tall (over ), lean and handsome with a classic profile and magnificently muscled body. He has wide-set steel gray eyes that are icy, cruel and dangerous. He is hard-faced, with a firm straight mouth, laugh-lines around the eyes, and a firm cleft chin. His hair is thick and dark. He has a small tattoo of a blue axe on the inside right lower arm near the elbow\u2014the ultimate ID for an AXE agent. At least one novel states that the tattoo glows in the dark. Carter also has a knife scar on the shoulder, a shrapnel scar on the right thigh. He has a sixth sense for danger. Carter served as a soldier in World War II, then with the OSS, before he joined his current employer AXE. Carter practices yoga for at least 15 minutes a day. Carter has a prodigious ability for learning foreign languages. He is fluent in English (his native tongue), Cantonese,Dragon Flame French,The Eyes of the Tiger German,Fraulein Spy Greek,Seven Against Greece Hungarian,The Devil's Cockpit Italian, Portuguese,Checkmate in Rio Putonghua (Mandarin),The China Doll Russian,The 13th Spy Sanskrit,A Korean Tiger SpanishA Bullet for Fidel and Vietnamese.SaigonSaigon He has basic skills in Arabic,Safari for Spies Hindustani,Double Identity Japanese, Korean, Romansch, Swahili, and Turkish.Istanbul In the early novels, Carter often assumes a number of elaborate disguises in order to execute his missions. ==Weapons and paraphernalia== Nick Carter uses three main weapons during the course of the series, all of which are named, and have histories. The gun, Wilhelmina, is a stripped-down German Luger. In the earliest stories, Carter got the gun off a German officer during a harrowing mission during World War II. Later stories state that he has had a series of Lugers, all named Wilhelmina. The knife, Hugo, is a pearl-handled 400-year-old stiletto crafted by Benvenuto Cellini. The blade retracts into the handle, and the knife is worn on a special sheath on the wrist, designed to release it into the user's hand with a simple muscle contraction. The third member of the triad is Pierre, a poison gas bomb, which is a small egg-shaped device, usually carried in a pocket but sometimes as a \"third testicle\" at his scrotum. Activated with a simple twist, it would, within seconds, kill anyone or anything that breathed its odorless and colorless gas. Carter often takes with him other weapons as the mission demands. These have included: * Cousin of Pierre: a smaller version of Pierre the poison gas bomb that can be concealed even more easily\u2014described in The China Doll; * Fang: a poison-tipped needle worn on a concealed index finger cap described in Saigon; * Pepito: a non-lethal stun grenade used in Checkmate in Rio. * Tiny Tim: a nuclear grenade \"containing half a grain of sand of fissionable matter\" used in Istanbul and The Red Guard * 10,000-watt laser pistol used in Hanoi * Cigarette lighter that fires drugged darts used in Hanoi * Exploding cigars used in Hanoi Carter has used a variety of equipment in the novels, most of which have nicknames. These have included: * Antonio Moreno: a lifelike facemask made of a latex substance called Lastotex (apparently named after Antonio Moreno, the 1920s silent movie star); * Gladstone: a rhino hide suitcase with multiple concealed compartments; * Oscar Johnson: a small radio transmitter (unclear if it is named after Oscar Johnson, a baseball player active in the 1920s and 1930s, or Oscar G. Johnson, the World War II Medal of Honor recipient); * Quantity K: a powerful acid strong enough to destroy evidence/documents; * Laser torch: for burning through door locks used in The Weapon of Night; * Singing Sam: a radio receiver concealed in electric razor/electric toothbrush used in Istanbul; * Wristwatch with UHF transmitter used in Hanoi; * Triple X tablet: a universal poison antidote and pep pill used in Hanoi; * Talkalot: a scopolamine-like truth drug used in Danger Key; * Unnamed injectable knockout drug requiring subsequent injection of antidote to regain consciousness used in The Weapon of Night; * Store: an injectable drug that induces a week-long state of suspended animation used in Peking & The Tulip Affair ==AXE== The agency Carter works for is described as being smaller and far more secret than the CIA, mostly concerned with assassinations. In the first novel of the series, Run, Spy, Run, AXE is described as \"the trouble-shooting arm of the US secret services\". AXE headquarters are located in the 6th floor offices of a building in DuPont Circle, Washington, DC under the cover of the Amalgamated Press and Wire Service. AXE is purported to contain several different departments with specific functions including Editing (later called \"Special Effects and Editing\")\u2014headed by Geoffrey Poindexter\u2014which, among other things, creates false biographies for agents and provides appropriate props (e.g. fake latex fingerprints); Documents\u2014whose role is to plant stories in the media to support specific activities and create false identification and travel documents; Records\u2014which provides background information on suspects; and Operations\u2014which provides logistic support for specific missions. AXE has a branch office near Columbus Circle, New York City and affiliate offices in countries around the world. Agents are given code designations; Carter's N3, which has at least once been stated as standing for Number three, identifies him as one of the elite Killmasters. It has been stated in some novels that there are four Killmasters in AXE, with Carter the most senior. The meaning of the code N3 is described differently in different novels\u2014sometimes it is Carter's personal designation, other times it is considered a rank, with N1 being the highest, while in other novels we are told that Carter is the third Killmaster to have worked for AXE, with both his predecessors having been killed in action. * David Hawk, described in early novels as looking a lot like Uncle Sam, is the head of AXE and Carter's personal boss. * Della Stokes, Hawk's personal secretary, is a character similar to Bond's Miss Moneypenny\u2014flirtatious but serious. * Ginger Bateman is Hawk's personal secretary in later novels. * Geoffrey Poindexter, AXE's equivalent to Q, runs the Special Effects and Editing department; in charge of weapons, gadgets, disguises, and papers. ==AXE agents== In the first novel in the series (Run, Spy, Run), AXE is described as comprising 24 agents.
