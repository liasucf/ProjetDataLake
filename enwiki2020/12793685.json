    "text": "Neucleus is a student newspaper published at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. The magazine is produced by the University of New England Students' Association. == History == Neucleus was established in April 1947. === Voluntary student unionism === The implementation of voluntary student unionism in 2006 had a significant impact on the viability of student newspapers across Australia, compulsory student union membership fees having been the major source of income for most. === Post-VSU return === After a period of six years absence, the publication returned in 2013 under the name Nucleus. === New media age === As of 2018 the Nucleus has taken a new angle and started publishing digitally with a minimisation of print media. The 2017-18 UNESA Board of Directors in conjunction with a former editor, Nicholas McCann, helped to form this new version of the publication.
