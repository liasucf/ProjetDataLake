He was appointed Apostolic Administrator of Santiago by Pope Francis on 23 March 2019, then Archbishop there on 27 December (installed 11 January 2020). ==Biography== A\u00f3s Braco was born in Artaiz (Unciti) in the province of Navarra, Spain, on 6 April 1945. He studied philosophy in Zaragoza and theology in Pamplona. He took his initial vows as a Capuchin on 15 August 1964 at Sang\u00fcesa and his final vows on 16 September 1967 in Pamplona. He received his priestly ordination on 30 March 1968. He then fulfilled assignments in Spain as professor in Lecaroz\u2013Navarra and vicar in Tudela. He earned his licentiate in psychology at the University of Barcelona in 1980. In 1980-1981, he held a fellowship that allowed him to conduct psychological research at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Returning to Spain he was professor in Pamplona and vicar in Zaragoza. He was transferred to Chile in 1983 where he was appointed parochial vicar in Longav\u00ed, diocese of Linares. Two years later, he was elected superior of the Capuchin community in Los \u00c1ngeles and subsequently he was transferred to Recreo (Vi\u00f1a del Mar), becoming the episcopal vicar for the consecrated life of the Diocese of Valpara\u00edso. Other responsibilities included economic provincial of the Capuchins in Chile, Promotor of Justice of the ecclesiastical tribunal of Valpara\u00edso, judge of the ecclesiastical tribunal of Concepci\u00f3n, and treasurer of the Chilean association of canon law. In 2007, while promoter of justice in Valparaiso, he heard but judged \"implausible\" a complaint of sexual abuse made by a former seminarian against a former rector of the seminary, and the seminarian did not file a formal complaint to press the issue. Pope Francis named him Bishop of Copiap\u00f3 on 25 July 2014, and he received his episcopal ordination on 18 October from the apostolic nuncio to Chile, Ivo Scapolo. On 23 March 2019, Francis gave him the additional position of Apostolic Administrator of Santiago, and A\u00f3s took up his responsibilities at a Mass there the next day. On 18 April 2019, A\u00f3s Braco refused communion to at least two people who knelt to receive it, though norms allow communicants to stand or kneel. A week later he distributed Communion to people kneeling. In mid-May he told an interviewer: On 27 December 2019, Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Santiago. At A\u00f3s Braco's installation as archbishop on 11 January 2020 a small group of protestors lit gas canisters in the cathedral as part of the ongoing protests. ==References== ==External links== * Diocese of Copiap\u00f3, Nuestro Obispo Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:University of Zaragoza alumni Category:University of Barcelona alumni Category:Navarrese people Category:Capuchin bishops Category:Bishops and archbishops of Santiago Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops ",
