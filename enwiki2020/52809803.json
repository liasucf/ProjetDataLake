Fox then present on Rode-Island in New England) is a book written by Rhode Island founder and Reformed Baptist theologian Roger Williams in 1676. The book discusses the debate regarding traditional Protestant Christianity and Quakerism with its different belief in the \"inner light,\" which Williams considered heretical. In 1672, Roger Williams (at age 68) rowed alone, all night, from Providence to Newport to debate prominent Quakers William Edmondson, John Stubbs (c.1618\u20131675), and John Burnyeat at nine the next morning. Williams initially wanted to debate the famous English Quaker George Fox, but Fox left Rhode Island without answering Williams' letter inviting him to a debate. In response to Williams' request, the Quakers agreed to debate him for three days in Newport and one day in Providence. Williams' account of the debates was printed in Boston by John Foster in 1676. ==References== ==External links== *Full Copy of George Fox Digged out of his Burrowes (accessible on Google Books) Category:1676 books Category:17th-century Christian texts ",
