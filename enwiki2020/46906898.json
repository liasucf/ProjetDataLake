Observers had noticed her struggle with the apparatus over the months leading up to the competition including her former coach B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi, past and present teammates, and even her present coach Al Fong. Gomez's technique on the extremely difficult Yurchenko vault had been described as shaky at best, and Gomez was unable to perform the vault with any consistency during practices, sometimes missing her feet on the springboard. A teammate from K\u00e1rolyi's, Chelle Stack, later stated, \"You could tell it was not a safe vault for her to be doing. Someone along the way should have stopped her.\" However, Julissa's coaches insisted that she needed to continue training and competing the Yurchenko vault in order to achieve high scores. Gomez fell into a coma during treatment due to a hospital error and never awoke, passing away in 1991. Christy Henrich died from anorexia nervosa in 1994. Her condition was allegedly spurred by comments from international judges and her coaches. Desperate to move up the ranks in the highly competitive world of Olympic- level gymnastics, Henrich took the criticisms to heart; her drive to lose a few pounds progressed to unhealthy eating habits and, eventually, became full- blown anorexia nervosa.\"Dying to Win: The Christy Henrich story\" Dateline,1995Obituary New York Times July 28, 1994 At the time of her passing she weighed 47 pounds. The impact of her illness and death led to changes in the way coaches across the nation implement nutrition in training, as well as how television and media discuss gymnast's bodies. \"Striking the Balance\", Benita Fitzgerald Mosley, Technique magazine, July 1997 == References == Category:Companies established in 1979 Category:Gymnastics clubs Category:Gymnastics clubs in the United States Category:Gymnastics in Missouri ",
