In 2006, Brazilian singers Lio Junior and Thiago Casarejos created MadHouse, a blend of image and sound mixing styles, aesthetics, personality and musical genres. == History == Lio Junior and Thiago Casarejos met after talking online for some time about musical affinities and a handful of coincidences, such as several common friends, even though they had never seen each other. They talked a lot about music in a train from the city of Mogi das Cruzes to S\u00e3o Paulo and the first ideas for projects sprouted as well as a lifetime musical partnership and friendship. Amongst all the things they had in common was the desire to create a new Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll concept as a duo. They sang together in a band in S\u00e3o Paulo as a test for what was to come next. After one year they moved to the state of Minas Gerais where they started a band named MadHouse with another four members. They wore outfits and makeup that reminded of glam rock bands and were mostly influenced by hard rock and classic rock. Quickly the struggle to keep musicians with their same goals, musical and creative ambitions, led MadHouse to become a duo and they started hiring a band to join them in shows. The contact and exchange they experienced with every different band formation drew them to keep exploring their own musical concept and identity. In Minas Gerais they played with Doctor Sin's guitarist Edu Ardanuy and they were also the opening act for the Zimbo Trio in a local jazz festival. When they moved to S\u00e3o Paulo, where they are well known by several Brazilian artists and celebrities, they started creating their own material and in 2015 they recorded their first original song \u201cVendetta\u201d., produced by Thiago \u201cBig\u201d Rabello. Right after that they were invited for a series of shows in the world's musical capital \u2013 Ibiza \u2013 where they played a three-month season singing in the trendiest places in the island, which reverberated on local media with interviews on the local radio station and its main communication vehicles. \u201cVendetta\u201d was the subject of an interview on Global RadioGlobal Radio and White Radio, the two main radio stations in Ibiza. The duo was highlighted in the cultural column of the newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Ibiza where they talked about their stay on the island. MadHouse in Programa do J\u00f4 After the release of their song \u201cVendetta\u201d during the summer season in Ibiza, MadHouse returned to Brazil and shot a music video to follow up the release of the song in their home country. The duo started publicizing their single and made their way on highly regarded TV shows, websites and news portals \u201cFalling\u201d, their second single, was released with a lyric video shot in the city and coastline of S\u00e3o Paulo, followed by the release of its official music video, exploring images of the lyric video merged with studio images. After a series of concerts at Burlesque \u2013 Paris 6 in 2017, the duo went back to Ibiza and released a special remix of \u201cVendetta\u201d produced by DJ Deeplick to celebrate the first anniversary of the song. During their stay in Europe, they shot the music video of their third single \u201cNo More\u201d, and were once again the focus of the local media. The video was released in March 2018 and has several special guests, such as Brazilian influencers Cau\u00ea Moura and PC Siqueira, visual artist Olivier Mour\u00e3o as well as fashion designers and models from Adlib Moda Ibiza, an association of local designers that is responsible for spreading the fashion from Ibiza throughout Europe. After Ibiza, the duo went to London to search for inspiration for their next single. In 2018 the singers were invited to sing in Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o, the most popular TV show in Brazil, in a tribute to Ray Charles.
