    "text": "\"The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley\" is a 1971 spoken word recording with vocals by Terry Nelson and music by pick-up group C-Company. == Inspiration and meaning == The song is set to the tune of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\". It offers a heroic description of Lieutenant William Calley, who in March 1971 was convicted of murdering Vietnamese civilians in the My Lai Massacre of March 16, 1968. The song discusses different opinions of the Vietnam War. It starts off with Calley's childhood and how being a part of the war and fighting for your country was an aspiration for young children. It later on discusses how at the time many Americans believed the killings in the war were wrong: \"they've made me out a villain\". Then the song talks about how in Vietnam soldiers were being killed and ambushed. Finally it ends by saying that Calley was not to blame; he was only following orders and he thought it was an honor to fight at first, but there was no purpose or reward in doing so. == Lyrical account == The song begins with an idealized, fictional account of Calley's childhood. It subsequently portrays factually Calley's early war experiences and the fatalities of young men in his company. It then goes on to relate the events at My Lai from Calley's point of view. == Background and success == {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1971) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles |align=\"center\"|49 |- |} The song was written in April 1970 by Julian Wilson and James M.
