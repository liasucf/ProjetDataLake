    "text": "Concept of a Virgin Hyperloop Heavy traffic along I-70 west of St. Louis The Missouri Hyperloop is a proposed high-speed transportation route in the U.S. state of Missouri. The hyperloop would connect the cities of St. Louis, Columbia, and Kansas City, complementing the busy Interstate 70. Cross-state travel between Missouri's two largest cities would be reduced from four hours to under 30 minutes. In 2017, the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition was formed as a partnership between Virgin Hyperloop One, the University of Missouri, and engineering firm Black & Veatch. The coalition released a report that concluded such a hyperloop was feasible, the first such study in the United States. Benefits touted by the study include annual monetary savings of 500 million, fast and cheap travel for over 5 million people in Missouri's two largest metropolitan areas, and connecting technology and research centers including the University of Missouri. In 2019, Missouri Governor Mike Parson announced the formation of a \"Blue Ribbon\" panel to examine the details of funding and construction, including a potential test track. The corridor has been described as an ideal location because of its relative flatness, population density, and preexisting infrastructure. Virgin Hyperloop CEO Jay Walder referred to Missouri as a \u201cmodel process\u201d for planning hyperloops. In June 2019, Virgin Hyperloop One announced a partnership with the Sam Fox School of Washington University of St. Louis to further investigate different proposals for the Missouri Hyperloop. ==References== Category:Hyperloop Category:Transportation in Missouri ",
