    "text": "The FemINist INitiative of BC (FemINit BC) was a political party that was registered in the province of British Columbia, Canada on June 22, 2005 by a group of women living in poverty. Through a process of grassroots consultation and consensus building, organizers aimed to develop a party and candidates guided by the values of \"INclusiveness, INtegrity, INvolvement and INnovation\". The plan to use these values, together with FemINit's constitution, guided the development of its policies, procedures, platforms and conduct. The party's stated goals were to: *\"strive for harmony by working toward achieving a society in which its cultural, social, political and economic institutions reflect the balance of the feminine and the masculine inherent in British Columbia's people.\" *\"reach out to members of BC society who have been marginalized by societal biases, the bureaucratic wall of silence, and political bungling and lack of awareness; and encourage their meaningful participation in the formation of policy affecting their lives.\" *\"bring civility and openness to the political realm and respect for those with opposing viewpoints.\" *\"demonstrate through action, and talk without double-speak, that INclusiveness, INtegrity and INnovation can reignite the electorate, inspiring the INvolvement of voters in the political process.\" ==See also== The FemINist INitiative of Canada, the national party which was spawned from the British Columbia movement.
