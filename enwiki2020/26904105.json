Bodnarchuk was born in Drumheller, Alberta, but grew up in Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia. ==Playing career== Bodnarchuk played junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Halifax Mooseheads. He was drafted by the Bruins in the fifth round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. After spending most of the 2009\u201310 season with the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL), Bodnarchuk made his NHL debut on April 3, 2010, in a 2\u20131 overtime victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs. On July 6, 2012, Bodnarchuk signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He was assigned to the Kings' AHL affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, with which he later won the Calder Cup with in the 2014\u201315 season. On July 2, 2015, Bodnarchuk left the Kings organization as a free agent and signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Following a promising training camp in Columbus, he was assigned to begin the 2015\u201316 season with Columbus' AHL affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters. In 14 games, Bodnarchuk was leading the Monsters defence on the top pairing, contributing with 8 points, before he was recalled to the Blue Jackets on November 21, 2015. He made his debut with Columbus, playing his first NHL game since 2010, in a 5\u20133 defeat against the San Jose Sharks the following day. In his 11th career game, Bodnarchuk recorded his first NHL point in a 2\u20131 shootout loss to the Florida Panthers on December 4, 2015. Bodnarchuk played in 16 games with the Blue Jackets before he was placed on waivers in order to return to the Monsters. On January 5, 2016, Bodnarchuck was claimed off of waivers by the Colorado Avalanche. He made his debut with the Avalanche playing alongside defensive partner Fran\u00e7ois Beauchemin in a 4\u20133 victory over the St. Louis Blues on January 6, 2016. At the conclusion of his contract, Bodnarchuk left the Avalanche as a free agent to sign a two-year, two-way contract with the Dallas Stars on July 1, 2016. Added to the Stars organization to provide a depth option on the blueline, Bodnarchuk was assigned to Dallas' AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars, for the duration of his contract. In the 2017\u201318 season, he helped Texas reach the Calder Cup finals before losing a Game 7 decider to the Toronto Marlies. As an impending free agent, Bodnarchuk opted to sign his first contract abroad, agreeing to a two- year deal with reigning three-time defending German champions EHC M\u00fcnchen of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) on June 18, 2018. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
