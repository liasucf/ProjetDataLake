    "text": "Some Things Never Change is the tenth album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in March 1997. ==Overview== Some Things Never Change represented a deliberate return to the band's earlier sound (before Free as a Bird), using more organic recording techniques than on their previous studio album. John Helliwell recounted that \"we recorded the album in a way that Supertramp never had and that was by all going into the studio together and doing it as a much more live thing.\"Overall, Rick (22 July 1997). Summer Tramp , Jam! Music. The album features the single \"You Win, I Lose\", which was a minor hit in Germany and also received considerable airplay in Canada.Stevenson, Jane (25 July 1997). Supertramp Reunion Was Logical Thing to Do , Jam! Music. The song \"Live to Love You\" features both the 'tackled' sound from the Coleco Electronic Quarterback handheld electronic game, as well as the Trouble \"Pop-o-matic bubble\" sounds from their 1979 hit \"The Logical Song\". ==Cover art== Rick Davies explained the concept behind the album cover: \"It's something to tie in with the title. In England people have tea at four o'clock and it doesn't matter where they are or what sort of social plane they're on, they will have that tea.\"Bollenberg, John \"Bobo\" (26 June 2000). Interview with Rick Davies, John Helliwell, Jack Douglass, and Georges Ohayon, ProgressiveWorld.net. ==Reception== Allmusic commented that the album retains the same style and strong instrumental interplay from the band's glory years, but lacks the \"ingratiatingly catchy melodies\" of that era, making it of strong interest to the band's fans but much less to casual listeners. ==Track listing== All songs written and sung by Rick Davies except where noted. #\"It's a Hard World\" \u2013 9:46 #\"You Win, I Lose\" \u2013 4:31 #\"Get Your Act Together\" \u2013 4:49 #\"Live to Love You\" \u2013 5:18 #\"Some Things Never Change\" \u2013 6:26 #\"Listen to Me Please\" \u2013 4:46 #*Lead vocals: Rick Davies and Mark Hart #\"Sooner or Later\" (Rick Davies/Mark Hart) \u2013 6:50 #*Lead vocals: Mark Hart #\"Help Me Down That Road\" \u2013 4:36 #\"And the Light\" \u2013 4:40 #*Drums: Tom Walsh #\"Give Me a Chance\" (Rick Davies/Mark Hart) \u2013 4:24 #*Lead vocals: Mark Hart #\"C'est What?\" \u2013 8:17 #\"Where There's a Will\" \u2013 5:36 ==Personnel== *Rick Davies \u2013 keyboards, vocals *Mark Hart \u2013 guitars, keyboards, vocals *John Helliwell \u2013 saxophones, woodwinds *Cliff Hugo \u2013 bass *Bob Siebenberg \u2013 drums *Lee Thornburg \u2013 trombones, trumpets, background vocals *Carl Verheyen \u2013 guitars *Tom Walsh \u2013 percussion, drums on \"And The Light\" Additional personnel *Bob Danziger \u2013 Kalimbas *Karen Lawrence \u2013 background vocals *Kim Nail \u2013 background vocals *Fred Mandel - guitars on \"And The Light\" (uncredited as a musician on the cover) ===Production=== *Producers: Jack Douglas, Fred Mandel *Executive producer: Rick Davies *Engineers: Ian Gardiner, Jay Messina *Assistant engineers: Ian Gardiner, Mike Scotella *Mixing assistant: Roy Clark, Brian Hargrove *Mastering: Bob Ludwig *Creative director: Richard Frankel *Cover art: Dimo Safari *Portraits: Dennis Keeley ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (1997) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Albums Chart |5 |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |9 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Albums Chart |12 |- |align=\"left\"|French SNEP Albums Chart |2 |- |align=\"left\"|German Media Control Albums Chart |3 |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Albums Chart |22 |- |align=\"left\"|Norwegian Albums Chart |19 |- |align=\"left\"|Spanish Albums Chart |8 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart |2 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Albums Chart |74 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Chart (1997) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |90 |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart |46 |- |align=\"left\"|German Albums Chart |46 |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Albums Chart |96 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart |49 |- |} ==Certifications and sales== ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1997 |\"You Win, I Lose\" |German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|63 |- |} ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Supertramp albums Category:Albums produced by Jack Douglas (record producer) ",
