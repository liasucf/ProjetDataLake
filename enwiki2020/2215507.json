The station is owned by Bell Media which also owns sister stations CFXY-FM and CIBX-FM. Based on the current format, CKHJ competes with Stingray- owned CFRK-FM. On May 28, 2019, as part of a country-wide format reorganization by Bell, CKHJ and the repeater frequencies rebranded as Pure Country 103.5, along with Nova Scotia cousin CKTY-FM and 11 other stations.Bell Media Rebrands 13 Canadian Country Stations As Pure Country ==History == Logo used until 2019 The station at 1260 AM first signed on August 19, 1977 as CIHI. In June 2000, the station swapped frequencies with what was then CKHJ-FM, with CIHI assuming CKHJ's 105.3 frequency and CKHJ moving to 1260 AM. CIHI-FM would subsequently become CFXY-FM. There are two rebroadcasters of CKHJ on FM due to the AM station's weak signal to the south and east of the city: CKHJ-1-FM on 95.1 in New Maryland, and CKHJ-2-FM in 103.5 in Oromocto. All three transmitters can be heard over most of Fredericton, effectively creating a simulcast.Decision CRTC 92-249 CKHJ, along with CIHI, was owned by Radio One Ltd. from its creation until 1999, when they were sold to Telemedia Communications. Telemedia then sold the stations to Astral Media in 2002. Current owners Bell Media acquired the stations from Astral Media in 2013. The station's transmitter is on Royal Road, northwest of Fredericton. On November 27, 2008, CKHJ applied to increase the signal of CKHJ-2-FM Oromocto.Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2008-110Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2008-110-1 The station received approval on January 26, 2009.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-32 On August 20, 2020, Bell Media submitted an application to reduce CKHJ's nighttime AM signal from 10,000 watts to 32 watts, while the daytime power would remain at 10,000 watts.
