Founded by Jessica Horwell in 2012, Hardware LDN has steadily been gaining a celebrity following and has had a range in Topman. Hardware LDN is based in London. == History == Jessica Horwell is a self-taught fashion designer who started by creating jewelry out of items found at hardware stores. After a short stint as a stylist for the likes of Rihanna, Tinie Tempah and Eliza Doolittle, she wanted to return to the more creative side of design and expand her collection from jewelry to clothes and other accessories but returned to her previous work as inspiration for the name Hardware LDN. == Influences == Horwell draws on a wide range of influences for her designs. Most notably these include London, music and the 1990s. She describes the brand as \"bold, edgy, provocative, fun, London\" and wants to \"create a lifestyle brand with a strong identity\". Horwell has strong connections with the music industry having hosted music events. Hardware LDN has been seen on musicians such as AlunaGeorge, Jessie J, Tinie Tempah and Mac Miller, and in summer 2015 provided the clothing for all the backing dancers for Rita Ora's UK summer tour. ==References== == External links == * Category:British companies established in 2012 Category:Clothing companies of England Category:Clothing retailers of England ",
