    "text": "Axiomatic semantics is an approach based on mathematical logic for proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to Hoare logic. Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statements\u2014predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program. ==See also== * Algebraic semantics (computer science) \u2014 in terms of algebras * Denotational semantics \u2014 by translation of the program into another language * Operational semantics \u2014 in terms of the state of the computation * Formal semantics of programming languages \u2014 overview * Predicate transformer semantics \u2014 describes the meaning of a program fragment as the function transforming a postcondition to the precondition needed to establish it. * Assertion (computing) Category:Formal specification languages Category:Logic in computer science Category:Programming language semantics ",
