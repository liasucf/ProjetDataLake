Voigt was Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany when the Australian Government recognised the German Democratic Republic in December 1972, which entailed the exchange of ambassadors, but despite the limited recognition of East Germany given by his government Voigt expressed that the decision was a \"sovereign decision\" for Australia to make. In October 1974 Voigt was appointed as Ambassador to Iraq in order to reopen the Embassy that had been closed since 1965 in Baghdad. However he only served in that office briefly before he was sent to the Embassy in Stockholm in September 1976 to relieve Ambassador Heinz Dietrich Stoecker who had been taken hostage on 24 April 1975 during the West German Embassy siege by the Red Army Faction. He served there until 1978. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:German judges Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Sweden Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Morocco Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Australia Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Iraq Category:Diplomats from Hamburg Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:University of Hamburg alumni Category:Possibly living people Category:Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ",
