    "text": "Patsy Dan Rodgers (Patsa\u00ed Dan Mag Ruaidhr\u00ed) was a painter, musician, and the King of Tory from the 1990s until his death in 2018. ==Biography== Rodgers was born in 1944 on Westland Row. His family adopted him and took him to Tory when he was about four years of age. His paintings have been exhibited worldwide. As a youth Derek Hill had personally inspired him to paint during Hill's visits to Tory, and he was also devoted to music and his native language. The musical instrument with which he was most associated was the button accordion. He often sported a black seafarer's cap. During the 1970s and 1980s, he steadfastly opposed assimilation of Tory's inhabitants into Ireland. The Kingship of Tory was granted him during the 1990s when the children of his predecessor, Padraig \u00d3g Rodgers, endorsed him for the position, and for more than two decades Rodgers often personally welcomed visitors arriving in Tory in his native tongue. He also performed ambassadorial duties when abroad. While visiting nearby in May 2016, Prince Charles of Wales expressed the wish to one day visit Tory and meet Rodgers, but he never did.Wales embarked on two further summer visits to nearby territories before the King of Tory's death: these, however, were further afield than the one in 2016, involving visits to County Kildare and the nearby cities of Dublin and Kilkenny, and visits to Derrynane, Tralee, Killarney and the city of Cork. See, for example: on the former, and, on the latter: In 1997, Rodgers received an honorary master's degree from the University of Ulster. Rodgers resided at West Town. He died on 19 October 2018 in the Mater Hospital at the age of 74. His remains were flown back to Tory, where he was buried following a funeral ceremony attended by various dignitaries from neighbouring lands. Rodgers had three daughters and a son, all of whom outlived him, as did two grandchildren. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Tory Island Category:20th- century accordionists Category:20th-century painters Category:21st-century accordionists Category:21st-century painters ",
