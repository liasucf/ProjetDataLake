Her training as an artist began in 1781 under \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, and she entered Jacques-Louis David's atelier in 1786 along with her sister Marie-\u00c9lisabeth Laville-Leroux. The poet Charles-Albert Demoustier, who met her in 1784, was inspired by her in creating the character \u00c9milie in his work Lettres \u00e0 \u00c9milie sur la mythologie (1801). In 1791 she exhibited for the first time in the Salon de Paris, displaying her mythology-inspired picture Psych\u00e9 faisant ses adieux \u00e0 sa famille. Another of her paintings of this period, L'Innocence entre la vertu et le vice, is similarly mythological and reveals her feminist interests\u2014in this picture, vice is represented by a man, although it was traditionally represented by a woman. In 1793, she married the lawyer Pierre-Vincent Benoist. Her work, reflecting the influence of Jacques-Louis David, tended increasingly toward history painting by 1795. In 1800, she exhibited Portrait d'une n\u00e9gresse (as of 2019 renamed \"Portrait to Madeleine\") in the Salon. Six years previously, slavery had been abolished, and this image became a symbol for women's emancipation and black people's rights. The picture was acquired by Louis XVIII for France in 1818. Elisa Bonaparte, Emperor Napoleon's sister and Duchess of Lucca, painted by Marie-Guillemine Benoist about 1805 An important commission for a full-length portrait of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte\u2014Premier Consul Fran\u00e7ais in this period\u2014was awarded to her in 1803. This portrait was to be sent to the city of Ghent, newly ceded to France by the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville in 1801. Other honors came to her; she was awarded a Gold Medal in the Salon of 1804, and received a governmental allowance. During this time she opened an atelier for the artistic training of women. Her career was harmed by political developments, however, when her husband, the supporter of royalist causes, Comte Benoist, was nominated in the Conseil d'\u00c9tat during the post-1814 Bourbon Restoration. Despite being at the height of her popularity, \"she was obliged to abandon painting\" and pursuing women's causes, due in part to her devoir de r\u00e9serve or \"tactful withdrawal\" in English, in the face of the growing wave of conservatism in European society. ==Works== * Psych\u00e9 faisant ses adieux a sa famille (1791) * L'Innocence entre la vertu et le vice *Portrait of Madeleine (previously known as Portrait d\u2019une n\u00e9gresse (1800, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre)) * Portrait Madame Philippe Panon Debassayns de Richmont and Her Son Eugene (1802, Metropolitan Museum of Art) * Portrait de Napol\u00e9on (1804, court of Ghent) * Portrait du Mar\u00e9chal Brune (1805, d\u00e9truit ; une copie se trouve au Mus\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles) * Portrait de Pauline Borgh\u00e8se (1807, Mus\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles) * Portrait de Marie-\u00c9lise, grande duchesse de Toscane (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Lucca) * Portrait de l\u2019imp\u00e9ratrice Marie-Louise (Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau) * La lecture de la Bible, (1810, mus\u00e9e municipal, Louviers) * La Consultation ou La Diseuse de bonne-aventure, Saintes Mus\u00e9e municipal. ==See also== *:fr:Devoir de r\u00e9serve dans la fonction publique fran\u00e7aise ==References== ==Bibliography== *Marie-Juliette Ballot, Une \u00e9l\u00e8ve de David, La Comtesse Benoist, L'\u00c9milie de Demoustier, 1768-1826, Plon, Paris, 1914 *Astrid Reuter, Marie-Guilhelmine Benoist, Gestaltungsr\u00e4ume einer K\u00fcnstlerin um 1800, Lukas Verlag, Berlin, 2002 ==External links== * James Smalls, Slavery is a Woman: \"Race,\" Gender, and Visuality in Marie Benoist's Portrait d'une n\u00e9gresse. * Marie-Guillemine Benoist dans Artcyclopedia * Online pictures on Artnet Category:1768 births Category:1826 deaths Category:French women painters Category:French genre painters Category:French portrait painters Category:French neoclassical painters Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David Category:18th-century French painters Category:19th-century French painters Category:19th-century painters of historical subjects Category:19th-century French women artists Category:18th- century women artists Category:Artists from Paris ",
