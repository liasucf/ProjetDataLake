The Urusbiy family. == History == The Urusbiy surname has its origins in one of the representatives of the Sunshevs' surname () - the Bezengi Taubies (mountain princes). The grandson of Chepelleu, a son of Urusbiy Sunshev, left with his mother at the end of the 18th century, first to the Chegem society, where his mother came from. Having grown up and become acquainted with the neighboring Baksan gorge, he decided to leave forever. After taking his noblemen (uzdens), emcheks and serfs with their families from there, he settled in the Baksan gorge near the entrance to the gorge, near the border of the possessions of the Kabardinian princes Atazhukin, on the site called \"Kamyk\". Soon after the resettlement, Chepelleu received support from relatives of his mother - the Chegem princes (Taubiy). With the passage of time, the Urusbievs' surname was formed from Chepleleua and his descendants. The Urusbiy surname took the name of the father of the founder Chepleleu - Urusbiy Sunshev.Misost Kuchukovich Abaev. \"Historical essay. Balkaria\" February 6, 1911.
