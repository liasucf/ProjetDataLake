    "text": "Israel Emanuel Coll (born 22 July 1993) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Greek club Apollon Smyrnis. ==Career== Coll's first senior club became Ferro Carril Oeste in 2011\u201312, when he was an unused substitute on four occasions for the Primera B Nacional outfit. He made his professional debut in March 2013, featuring for the full duration of a 0\u20130 draw with Douglas Haig on 18 March. Two months later, Coll scored his first goal in a draw with Hurac\u00e1n. One hundred and five further appearances followed for Coll between 2013 and 2015; he also netted seven more goals in that period. He was loaned to Sarmiento of the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n on 7 January 2016. He featured four times as Sarmiento placed tenth in zone one. In the subsequent campaign, 2016\u201317, Coll was signed on loan by Primera B Nacional's Central C\u00f3rdoba. His debut season ended with relegation to Torneo Federal A, despite that Coll agreed to sign permanently in August 2017. After Central C\u00f3rdoba achieved instant promotion back up as champions, Coll departed the club and Argentine football as he joined Greek Football League side Panachaiki on 25 July 2018. He scored on his league debut, netting in a 2\u20132 draw with Aiginiakos on 28 October. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Ferro Carril Oeste |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"7|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2012\u201313 |11||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||11||1 |- |2013\u201314 |39||2||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||40||3 |- |2014 |20||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||21||0 |- |2015 |38||3||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Primera B Nacional play- offs||0||42||4 |- |2016 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !108!!6!!5!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!114!!8 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sarmiento (loan) |2016 |rowspan=\"1|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||4||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Central C\u00f3rdoba (loan) |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"1|Primera B Nacional |24||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||25||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Central C\u00f3rdoba |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1|Torneo Federal A |23||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||27||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !47!!0!!5!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!52!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Panachaiki |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1|Football League |26||3||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||29||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !185!!9!!13!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!199!!11 |} ==Honours== ;Central C\u00f3rdoba *Torneo Federal A: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Football League (Greece) players Category:Super League Greece 2 players Category:Ferro Carril Oeste footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Sarmiento footballers Category:Central C\u00f3rdoba de Santiago del Estero footballers Category:Panachaiki F.C. players ",
