All the leadership could win for the contract workers was a token sum of Rs. 70. Disillusioned and angry workers resigned en masse from SKMS and joined to form a new union under the leadership. Thus, the Chhattisgarh Mines Shramik Sangh was born on 3 March 1977.

Among the first to volunteer in this Hospital are Dr Binayak Sen, Dr Asish kundu, and Dr Saibal Jana. Dr Jana is still a part of this. The movements in Chhattisgarh and Belur had evolved independent of each other, yet, they had one thing in common: the recognition of health as a fundamental right. In the 80s, the industrial situation in West Bengal was dismal. * 1998The original MoU for the construction of this new line was signed in 1998.

These are captive iron ore mines for Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP)a SAIL enterprise. Iron ores mined from the area are of the hematite and magnetite variety. The other mines in the neighbourhood produce dolomite, lime and other raw materials which go into steel production.
