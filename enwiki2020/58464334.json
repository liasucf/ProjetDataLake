Reviewer Donna Rolfe of The Dove Foundation called the holiday movie \"charming\", further adding the film \"is a heartwarming story about living your dreams and not just chasing them. Many children have moved away from their homes to places they thought may be better, only to find out there is no place better than where they grew up to find their dreams.\" In her review for Common Sense Media, Renee Schonfeld rated An Evergreen Christmas two stars from five, concluding: ... \"Ms. Closshey, recognized as a talented musician, wrote the music, participated in the filmmaking, and clearly wants to add acting to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9; it\u2019s an adequate effort. Overall it's an OK but uninspired film for older kids and teens that's unlikely to inspire multiple viewings.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * An Evergreen Christmas Category:2014 films Category:2014 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2010s Christmas films Category:Films set in 2014 Category:Films set in Tennessee Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:American Christmas films Category:2014 comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films ",
