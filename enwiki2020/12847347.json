    "text": "Freetown-Lakeville Middle School opened in 2002 and serves as a public Middle school to students from the towns of Freetown, Lakeville, and Assonet, Massachusetts. It educates around 750 students in grades 6-8 as part of the Freetown & Lakeville Public Schools. == History == In the mid-1950s, Freetown and Lakeville formed a regional school district. On April 8, 1957, voters in Freetown and Lakeville approved construction of Apponequet Regional High School. Farm land on Howland Road in Lakeville was donated, and the school opened on September 21, 1959 initially to serve grades 7-12. At this time, students in grades 7 and 8 attended Apponequet as there was no formal middle school within the district. The first official middle school built within the Freetown-Lakeville Regional School District was the George R. Austin Middle School. In 1972, Freetown and Lakeville Public Schools opened the George R. Austin Middle School, a 5-8 facility. The George R. Austin Middle School served as the district's middle school until 2002. In 1999, both towns proposed to construct a new middle school due to many of the classrooms being undersized with no natural light as constructed in the \"open plan\" design popular when the school was built in 1972. Both towns eventually voted in favor of constructing a new middle school which was completed for the Fall 2002 school year, and was named the Freetown-Lakeville Middle School. Since 2002 the Freetown-Lakeville Middle School opened serving students in grades 5 to 8. Since September 2004, it has served grades 6 to 8. The George R. Austin Middle School has been converted into an intermediate school serving students attending grades 4 and 5 within the district. Freetown-Lakeville MS follows three \"core values\": Respect, Responsibility, and Resiliency. These were laid out by principal Dave Patota. They summarize what the school expects of students. As of the 2018-2019 school year the administration consists of Principal Dave Patota and Assistant Principal Vanessa Harvey. == Academics == As of the 2018-2019 school year, there was an enrollment total of 750 at the Freetown-Lakeville Middle School. === National Junior Honor Society === FLMS has a National Junior Honor Society chapter for high achieving students.

Students wishing a vocational education can apply to Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School for grades 9-12. Also, because Freetown is a part of Bristol County, high school students from both towns may apply for available slots at the Bristol County Agricultural High School. Students from Lakeville can also attend Rising Tide Charter Public School, as Lakeville is a part of their designated region. There are also local private high schools that students can attend if they choose to enroll. == References == Category:Middle schools in Massachusetts Category:Education in Bristol County, Massachusetts Category:Educational institutions established in 2002 ",
