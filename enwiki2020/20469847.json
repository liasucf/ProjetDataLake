Created and directed by Marc Craste, it was indirectly inspired by \"The Carny\", a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. ==Plot== Madame Pica is the cold-hearted mistress of a circus of \"monsters and misfits\", attended each night by thousands of curious spectators. Hero is among them every night, but he is there only to see Jo Jo, the winged trapeze artist. One night after the show, he steals the keys of the cell where Jo Jo is imprisoned, freeing her. The two escape and start to dance a romantic waltz in the stars. But soon the two lovers are discovered and as a last desperate act, hand-in-hand, they jump from the highest window in the tower. Jo Jo attempts to fly the two of them to safety, but Hero loses his grip and falls to the ground. Jo Jo is blown onto a window sill and re-captured by Madame Pica. A single feather from JoJo's wing floats to the ground, landing on Hero's apparently lifeless body. Ten years pass, and Madame Pica is in search of some new attraction to draw in the crowds. She discovers that Hero is still alive but horribly disfigured, and takes him on as the new star of the show. He is taken to the cell next to JoJo's, and the reunited lovers embrace through the bars. ==Production== Marc Craste's original aim was to make a short film based on \"The Carny\", a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He began work on a storyboard, intending it to be a \"straight visual interpretation of the text\", featuring live action sequences combined with 3D animation. He received encouragement from Nick Cave, but was ultimately unable to secure funding for the project. In the following years, Craste made three one-minute films for Studio AKA, starring Madame Pica in a circus setting. Studio AKA then asked Craste to make \"a longer film using the same characters, but without any murders\". JoJo in the Stars was the result.Carter, Jonathan (2004-06-04). jojo in the stars interview. features, film interview. BBC. Retrieved on 14 December 2009.
