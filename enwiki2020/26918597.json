After the death of his elder brother, Ernest II (1611), he took over the rule of the Principality of L\u00fcneburg and acquired the Principality of Grubenhagen in 1617, which was merged. When the Thirty Years' War broke out he joined, with Duke Frederick of Holstein, the side of the Emperor, became colonel of the Lower Saxon Circle troops (Kreistruppen) and sought with great skill to keep the scene of the war as far from the bishopric territory as possible; despite that in 1623 the imperial forces under General Tilly occupied the land. When Lower Saxon noblemen then prepared to defend themselves, Christian resigned his post of circle colonel. Not until 1629, when the Edict of Restitution was passed, did he join the Protestant faith. He died on 8 November 1633. == Ancestors == == References == == Sources == * * C.V.
