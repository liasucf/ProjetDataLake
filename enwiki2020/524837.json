    "text": "The voiced labiodental approximant is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. It is similar to an English w pronounced with the teeth and lips held in the position used to articulate the letter V. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `P` or `v\\`. With an advanced diacritic, , this letter also indicates a bilabial approximant, though the diacritic is frequently omitted because no contrast is likely.Peter Ladefoged (1968) A Phonetic Study of West African Languages: An Auditory-instrumental Survey, p. 26.Joyce Thambole Mogatse Mathangwane (1996), Phonetics and Phonology of Ikalanga: A Diachronic and Synchronic Study, vol. 1, p. 79 The labiodental approximant is the typical realization of in the Indian and South African varieties of English. As the voiceless is also realized as an approximant (), it is also an example of a language contrasting voiceless and voiced labiodental approximants. ==Features== Features of the voiced labiodental approximant: ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !!
