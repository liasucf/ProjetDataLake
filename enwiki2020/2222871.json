Therefore it is usually the busiest face of the mountain and has mostly groomed runs along with intermediate and expert runs. Vance Creek is serviced by the \"Comet Six-pack Express\" which ferries skiers from below the Village base and Silver Woods areas to the summit at 1,915 m. The \"Summit Express\u201dis a gondola that takes skiers directly from the Village to the summit as well. Attridge is a small area beside Vance Creek which offers a wide variety of glade and groomed runs. The \"Alpine Meadows\" chair is a fixed grip quad and offers ski-in/ski-out access to the mountain from the developed area called Alpine Meadows. Silver Woods is a recent expansion of the resort which is part of a catchment below the Comet Express and is serviced by the \"Silver Woods Express\" which is a detachable high-speed quad. Silver Woods offers many intermediate treed and glade runs and is an access point to the hill from the \"Knoll Residential Area\". Putnam Creek is an area which introduces skiers to more difficult terrain than the rest of the mountain. Most of the runs in the Putnam Creek area are black diamond and double black diamond runs consisting of steep lines with moguls and tree skiing. The \"Powder Gulch Express\", a Detachable high-speed quad gives lift access to the many runs and a way out with the \"Home Run T-bar\" back to the village. ==History== The Early Days Vernon resident Bert Thorburn became the first person to ski in the Silver Star area in 1930. He rode his bike up to the end of a logging road in the area and then walked a distance following forestry trails to a forest fire lookout. He camped there for the night and skied down the next day. In 1946 the first rope tow was built on Burney Ridge, south of Vernon above the lookout overlooking Kalamalka Lake long. It was powered by an old four cylinder engine. The cooling system was a 40-gallon water drum hooked up to the radiator. For $.50, you could ski all day. A few years later the ski hill was moved to Lavington on Michael Freeman's farm on the north slope above Highway 6. This had one or two rope tows and a shack for warming up with an oil barrel wood fired stove. You walked across the pasture to get to the shed. But skiing was limited to a few months of the year. The Ski Club had their eyes on Silver Star Mountain where they could ski 6 months of the year. But Silver Star was part of a Class A provincial park with no development allowed. Silver Star Sports was started by Russ Postill, Mike Lattey, Bill Attridge, Joe Peters, John Cassa, Joyce Balestra and maybe John Hindle in 1956 or 1957. They got approval from the Province to build a ski hill in the Class A park in the summer of 1957 to go ahead but it was too late to build anything substantial so they brought in a trailer and small portable rope tow near Sovereign Lake where the snowmobile station is now. In 1958 the final three kilometers of the Silver Star road was pushed through by local contractor Russ Postill to the current day village area. Construction of two rope-tow lifts and an A-frame day lodge were built in 1958. In 1959 a poma lift was installed from the level at the parking lot to the top of SilverStar Mountain, replacing the rope tow. In 1964 new t-bars were installed to replace the slower rope tows and in 1965 a second A-frame structure was added to the day lodge. In 1967 and 1968 the Summit and Yellow Chairs (6,000 feet) built by GMD Mueller were installed, making Silver Star Mountain one of the largest ski areas in Canada. One of the challenges of the early rope tows was that the rope stretched as it was used and had to be cut, shortened and spliced at regular intervals. This was the job of Mike Lattey who would sit out in the snow undoing and splicing the cold wet rope under a tarp while everyone else stayed inside drinking hot chocolate. He was also the official photographer. Some of his photos can be seen in Paradise Camp and the pub in the village. SilverStar Mountain Resort Era In 1981 Silver Star Sports purchased by Norm Crerar, Charlie Locke, John Hindle, Rob Marshall and John Gow and becomes Silver Star Mountain Resorts Ltd. The first Nordic trails were also cleared. In 1983 the Putnam Station Hotel is built by Russell Haubrich and Shella Ledingham, it is Silver Star's first on hill hotel. From 1984-1990 many new hotels and amenities are built on the hill. In 1990 the Silver Queen chair was built by Yan and replaced by a doppelmayr quad chair and serves as the bunny hill.http://www.doppelmayr.com/upload/prj1/Inserate- Broschueren/annual2008_englisch_web.pdf In 1991 the original Putnam Creek and Vance Creek express quads were built and opened up extensive amounts of terrain. In 2001 the Schumann family, owners of Big White Ski Resort since 1985, reached an agreement in principle with the Honourable Judd Buchanan, (Order of Canada),the majority shareholder of Silver Star Mountain Resort on the purchase of the majority assets of Silver Star Mountain Resort. In 2002 Silver Star Mountain Resort invested heavily in new chair lifts and opening up new terrain followed by further expansion in 2005/06 to open up the Silver Woods ski area. 2005 was also the expansion of the Silver Star Bike Park to start using the Comet Six-Pack chairlift for biking. New trails were cut and all of the existing trails were extended all the way down to the bottom of the Comet chair. ==Nordic Skiing== SilverStar is renowned for its Cross-Country Skiing facilities.
