    "text": "Rolf Henne (7 October 1901 \u2013 25 July 1966) was a Swiss politician who supported a form of National Socialism. Born in Schaffhausen, Henne was a distant relative of Carl Jung on his father's side. Henne's own father was himself a prominent physician.Alan Morris Schom, A Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930-1945, Chapter 1 Educated at Zurich and Heidelberg, Henne worked as a lawyer.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 178 He joined the New Front in 1932, serving as Gaufuehrer for his hometown. On 4 February 1934, he took over as leader of the by then renamed National Front at a time when the movement was in trouble over the extent of its support for the Third Reich. Henne, a strong pro-German, struggled to retain control and in 1938 he was replaced by the more moderate Robert Tobler, his close links to the National Socialists and his advocacy of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion making him too extreme for many National Front members. Unable to serve under Tobler, Henne left to form the fiercely pro-National Socialist Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung with Hans Oehler and Jakob Schaffner. Henne was overlooked for leadership of this group, although he was confirmed as Gauf\u00fchrer for Schaffhausen. In 1940 he became a co-founder of the Nationale Bewegung der Schweiz. He took no further role in politics after the war, instead heading up the Argus der Presse press-cuttings agency. He died in K\u00fcsnacht in 1966. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1966 deaths Category:People from Schaffhausen Category:People associated with the University of Zurich Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:Swiss Nazis Category:Swiss lawyers Category:National Front (Switzerland) politicians Category:20th- century lawyers ",
