    "text": "\"Talk to Me\" is a song recorded by American singer Stevie Nicks for her third solo studio album Rock a Little (1985). Written by Chas Sandford, the song was released as the lead single from Rock a Little in October 1985, through Modern Records. The single became a big hit for Nicks, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks and peaking at number one on the Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs chart for two weeks in 1985.Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 457. ==Background and composition== The song was written by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit \"Missing You\". Sandford also plays most of the instruments on \"Talk to Me\". The song was brought to the attention of Nicks by its producer Jimmy Iovine, \"who was always on the hunt for a hit song.\" Stevie says she didn't like the song at first because she had trouble with the vocals, but Iovine persisted and she eventually recorded it. Jim Keltner was in the studio next door doing some drum overdubs during the recording process. After Nicks explained her dilemma, Keltner gave her some words of encouragement and offered to stay with her and be her audience. Nicks sang the song twice during the session and then it was finished. ==Music video== The promotional music video shows Nicks performing the song direct to camera in a variety of different sets in what looks like a grand house. One of the sets is a long white room that looks like an art gallery and has three steps in the middle which Nicks, her backing singers Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, and two male dancers, all perform choreographed dance steps together in formation. Nicks' brother, Christopher, features in the video playing the saxophone. ==Live performances== \"Talk to Me\" made its live debut on the Rock a Little world tour in 1986. It was also included on the Canadian leg of The Other Side of the Mirror tour set in 1989. It was also performed on the 1991 \"Whole Lotta Trouble Tour\" to promote her greatest hits album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks. ==Single release formats== \"Talk to Me\" was released as a 7-inch vinyl in many territories in the picture sleeve featured above, with \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" as its non-album B-side. Promo 7-inch singles with picture sleeve were also released in some countries, including the U.S., and featured the title track on both sides of the disc. Picture sleeves varied country by country in its European 7\" release, with Spain and Germany using sleeves which featured the artist name and title but no photograph, and the UK using a picture sleeve which featured the black-and-white photograph of Nicks which was used for the back cover of the Rock a Little LP sleeve. The single peaked at #68 in the UK.Official Charts Company - Stevie Nicks - Talk to Me A 3-track 12\" single was issued in the UK and Germany (but with differing picture sleeves), featuring the album version of the title track and \"One More Big Time Rock and Roll Star\" and \"Imperial Hotel\" as the B-sides.
