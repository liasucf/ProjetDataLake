    "text": "Helmut Franz (1911 \u2013 30 January 2002) was a German academic teacher and conductor who was known particularly for his work as a choral conductor. He was the director of NDR Chor, based in Hamburg, from 1966 to 1987, focused on a cappella music and contemporary music. == Career == Franz was Kapellmeister at the Hessisches Landestheater in Darmstadt and lecturer at the Akademie f\u00fcr Tonkunst there, when he became director of the NDR Chor, the choir of the broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) based in Hamburg. He succeeded Max Thurn who retired at the end of 1965. Franz was known for his focus on a cappella music and contemporary music. He established a concert series \"das neue werk\" (the new work). He conducted in 1967 Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's Lux aeterna for a 16-part choir a cappella, which became known as music for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The recording has been included as part of a collection Avantgarde by Deutsche Grammophon, released in 1968, and other collections of contemporary music. Premieres with the NDR Chor included Penderecki's Utrenja and Hanz Werner Henze's Das Flo\u00df der Medusa (The Raft of the Medusa) in 1968 which was interrupted by political protests in the audience. During the 1970s, the choir was a guest at several festivals, including Karlheinz Stockhausen's Atmen gibt das Leben, performed in Maribor, Zagreb and Sarajewo. Franz described the function of the NDR Chor: \"Der Rundfunkchor ist eine Gruppe von Spezialisten, die sich den h\u00f6chsten Aufgaben widmen, die ein Chor zu leisten f\u00e4hig ist. Der Chor hat nat\u00fcrlich durch seine Elitefunktion die Aufgabe, vor allem moderne Werke zu singen, die andere Ch\u00f6re aus zeitlichen Gr\u00fcnden oder aus F\u00e4higkeitsgr\u00fcnden nicht pflegen k\u00f6nnen.\" (The radio choir is a group of specialists devoted to the highest achievements. The choir is naturally obliged by its elite function to mainly sing modern works which other choirs can not perform for reasons of time or ability.) Franz was also a professor of opera at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater in Hamburg. == References == == External links == * * The 2001: A Space Odyssey Soundtrack Thread Steve Hoffman Category:German choral conductors Category:German male conductors (music) Category:1911 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater Hamburg faculty Category:20th- century German conductors (music) Category:20th-century German male musicians ",
