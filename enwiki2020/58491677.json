Corbett was born in Columbus, Georgia and raised in Thomasville. After graduating from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri and obtaining his master's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Corbett began his coaching career at Carver High School in Columbus, Georgia. After assistant coaching stints at South Carolina State and Tennessee State, he became head coach at Lincoln in 1971. At NCAA Division II Lincoln, Corbett led his teams to an eight-year 159\u201359 record from 1971 to 1979. During that time, the Blue Tigers won three Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) regular season championships (1972, 1975 and 1977) and one MIAA Tournament title (1977). His teams earned five NCAA Division II Tournament appearances (1972, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978) and never won fewer than 17 games in a season. Corbett's .729 winning percentage is the highest in program history. In 2014 he was named to the MIAA Hall of Fame. In 1979, Corbett moved to Division I North Carolina A&T.; After an initial rebuilding season where his Aggies went 8\u201319, Corbett's teams ran off a string of eight consecutive seasons winning either the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) regular season or tournament championship (winning both in five seasons). The Aggies program won seven consecutive MEAC Tournament titles between 1982 and 1988, a streak only equaled in Division I history by the Kentucky Wildcats. Corbett retired in 1993 with a 256\u2013145 record in his thirteen seasons.
