    "text": "\"Iron Man\" is a song written and performed by the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released on their 1970 album Paranoid. The lyrics tell the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present he is turned into steel by a magnetic field, and his attempts to warn the public are ignored and mocked. Feeling shunned and alone, Iron Man plans his revenge on mankind, causing the apocalypse seen in his vision. Upon hearing the main guitar riff for the first time, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne remarked that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking about\".Classic Albums \u2013 Paranoid, by Isis Productions/Eagle Rock Entertainment The title became \"Iron Man\", with Geezer Butler writing the lyrics around the title. Osbourne sang behind a metal fan to get the sound effect in its first line, 'I am Iron Man!'. Despite the title, the song has no connection to the Marvel Comics character of the same name, although it was used in the end credits of the 2008 movie Iron Man, and the trailer for the 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2. The character Tony Stark, alter-ego of Iron Man, also wears a Black Sabbath t-shirt in the 2012 film The Avengers. ==Awards and accolades== The Iron Man riff *The song won spot number 317 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time as of 2004. *\"Iron Man\" was ranked the sixth best Black Sabbath song by Rock \u2013 Das Gesamtwerk der gr\u00f6\u00dften Rock- Acts im Check. * The song peaked at number 52 on The Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. * The song reached number 68 on the Canadian RPM Magazine Top 100.http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.7505.pdf * VH1 ranked the song as the greatest heavy metal song of all time.VH1.com. archived 2007-11-18. * The live rendition of the song from Reunion won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/black- sabbath ==Personnel== *Ozzy Osbourne \u2013 vocals *Tony Iommi \u2013 guitar *Geezer Butler \u2013 bass *Bill Ward \u2013 drums ==Certifications== ==See also== * Self- fulfilling prophecy * Ontological paradox ==References== Category:1970 songs Category:1971 singles Category:Black Sabbath songs Category:Songs about time travel Category:Songs written by Ozzy Osbourne Category:Songs written by Tony Iommi Category:Songs written by Geezer Butler Category:Songs written by Bill Ward (musician) Category:Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance Category:Warner Records singles ",
