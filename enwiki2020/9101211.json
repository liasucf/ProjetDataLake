    "text": "The PowerTouch was an educational electronic tablet computer toy made by Fisher-Price that is similar in function to the LeapPad. However, unlike the LeapPad, the PowerTouch system does not require a stylus to operate. Rather, as the name implies, the PowerTouch has a touch-sensitive activity area. Additionally, the turning of book pages is sensed automatically through a row of infrared sensor on the top of the activity area. PowerTouch software titles consists of two parts: a cartridge and a corresponding book. Originally, the PowerTouch was only available in the colors Silver and Purple, but a Fashion Colour (Pink and Purple) version has since been made available in certain markets.
