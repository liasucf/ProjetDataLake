    "text": "Traianos Nallis in 1910 Traianos Nallis (, ) was an important Greek notable and politician. == Biography == Nallis was born in 1874 in Grade\u0161nica, then in the Ottoman Empire (now in North Macedonia). He grew up in Monastir (now Bitola), where his family had moved for security. His brother Stavros was one of the three founders of the Interior Organization of Monastir in 1904. Nallis was a notable of the Greek community and was elected in 1908 as a representative of the Greek community of the kaza of Monastir to the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies following the Young Turk Revolution. His election was a tremendous success for the local Greeks, as the election period was characterized by unprecedented violence as the Young Turks were trying to make as many Greeks as they could not to vote. Traianos Nallis was one of the three Greek deputies who were elected in the Monastir Vilayet and re-elected in the 1912 elections. == Sources == * \u0398\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u0397 \u039d\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7, \u03bf \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039f\u03b8\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 * \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 100 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd * \u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b6\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc, \u039f \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0391\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 3\u03bf): \u0397 \u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 (1904-1908) * Aykut Kansu, The Revolution of 1908 in Turkey, publications Brill, 1955, p. 228, 250 * Members of the Meclis-I Mebusan, 1912 * \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u0386\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u039f\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd: \u039f\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2, April 2012, \u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bb\u03b7: \u03a0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc 100 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u0391\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 1912, p. 4 Category:1874 births Category:Politicians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Greek politicians Category:People from Novaci Municipality Category:20th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:Year of death missing ",
