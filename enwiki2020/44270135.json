R. Vijaya) is still grieving the son she lost 25 years ago. She is living with her niece Indu (Karthika). Rajalakshmi meets Raju (Kakka Ravi), a medical representative. Indu also meets Raju and they fall for each other. Though Raju claims his parents are living in Philadelphia, on later scenes it is revealed that he is an orphan raised in a Christian orphanage. Balan Menon (Nedumudi Venu) is a relative of Rajalakshmi and has feelings for her since their youth. Rajalakshmi frequently tries to avoid Balan Menon's proposals to start a fresh life together. Raju requests Rajalakshmi for Indu's hand in marriage. Rajalakshmi refuses this since Raju is an orphan. Balan Menon tries to convince Rajalakshmi, but fails.
