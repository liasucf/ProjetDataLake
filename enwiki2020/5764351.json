It was out of print for years but has been re-released worldwide by Xtreem Music in 2006.Xtreemmmusic.com This remastered 2006 version includes the 1991 demo Unholy Domain as a bonus. The colour scheme of the artwork is somewhat different on the re-release, emphasizing copper and dark brown instead of the red-green-black of the original.
