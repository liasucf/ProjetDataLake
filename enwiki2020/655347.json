    "text": "King Harald I of Norway (right) receives Norway out of his father Halfdan the Black's hands in this illustration from the Flateyjarb\u00f3k. Flateyjarb\u00f3k is an important medieval Icelandic manuscript. It is also known as GkS 1005 fol. and by the Latin name Codex Flateyensis. It was commissioned by J\u00f3n H\u00e1konarson and produced by the priests and scribes J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson and Magn\u00fas \u00de\u00f3rhallsson. == Description == Flateyjarb\u00f3k is the largest medieval Icelandic manuscript, comprising 225 written and illustrated vellum leaves. It contains mostly sagas of the Norse kings as found in the Heimskringla, specifically the sagas about Olaf Tryggvason, St. Olaf, Sverre, H\u00e1kon the Old, Magnus the Good, and Harald Hardrada. But they appear here expanded with additional materialSuch as Nornagests \u00fe\u00e1ttr (\"the Story of Norna-Gest\"), Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa (\"Tale of Styrbj\u00f6rn the Swedish Champion\"), Hr\u00f3a \u00fe\u00e1ttr heimska (\"The Tale of Roi the Fool\") and V\u00f6lsa \u00fe\u00e1ttr (\"the Tale of the Phallos\"). not found elsewhere (some of it being very old) along with other unique differences. Most\u2014but not all\u2014of the additional material is placed within the royal sagas, sometimes interlaced. Additionally, the manuscript contains the only copy of the eddic poem Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0, a unique set of annals from creation to 1394, and many short tales not otherwise preserved such as Nornagests \u00fe\u00e1ttr (\"the Story of Norna Gest\"). Especially important is the Gr\u0153nlendinga saga (\"History of the Greenlanders\"), giving an account of the Vinland colony with some differences from the account contained in Eir\u00edks saga rau\u00f0a (\"History of Eir\u00edk the Red\"). Here also are preserved the only Icelandic versions of the Orkneyinga saga (\"History of the Orkney Islanders\") and F\u00e6reyinga saga (\"History of the Faroe Islanders\"). == History == From internal evidence the book was being written in 1387 and was completed in 1394 or very soon after. The first page states that its owner is \"Jonn Hakonar son\" and that the book was scribed by two priests. One of them, \"Jon prestr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ar son\", scribed the contents from the tale of Eir\u00edk the Traveller down to the end of the two Olaf sagas and the other, \"Magn\u00fas prestr Thorhallz sun\", scribed the earlier and later material and also drew the illustrations. Further material was inserted towards the end of the 15th century. The manuscript first received special attention by the learned in 1651 when Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson of Sk\u00e1lholt, with the permission of King Frederick III of Denmark, requested all folk of Iceland who owned old manuscripts to turn them over to the Danish king, providing either the original or a copy, either as a gift or for a price. Jon Finnsson, who resided on Flatey ('Flat Island') in the fjord of Brei\u00f0afj\u00f6r\u00f0ur on the northwest coast of Iceland, was then the owner of the book which was already known as the Flateyjarb\u00f3k. At first Jon refused to release his precious heirloom, the biggest and best book in all of Iceland, and he continued to refuse even when Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur paid him a personal visit and offered him five hundreds of land. Jon only changed his mind and bestowed the book on the bishop just as the bishop was leaving the region. The manuscript was given as a present from Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur to King Frederick III in 1656, and placed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen. In 1662, the bishop presented the king with a second medieval manuscript, the Codex Regius (Konungsb\u00f3k eddukv\u00e6\u00f0a). It and Flateyjarb\u00f3k survived the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 and the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 and were eventually repatriated to Iceland in 1971 as Icelandic national treasures. They are preserved and studied by the \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson Institute for Icelandic Studies. == Contents == Flateyjarb\u00f3k consists of the following texts: * Geisli \u2013 a religious poem on St. Olaf II of Norway * \u00d3lafs r\u00edma Haraldssonar \u2013 a poem on St. Olaf in the r\u00edmur style, the earliest such poetry * Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0 * A short piece from Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum * Sigur\u00f0ar \u00fe\u00e1ttr slefu * Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist * Genealogies of Norwegian kings * Eir\u00edks saga v\u00ed\u00f0f\u00f6rla * \u00d3lafs saga Tryggvasonar, including: ** Gr\u0153nlendinga saga ** F\u00e6reyinga saga ** J\u00f3msv\u00edkinga saga ** Otto \u00fe\u00e1ttr keisara ** Fundinn Noregr ** Orkneyinga \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** Albani \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok Sunnifu ** \u00cdslands bygging ** \u00deorsteins \u00fe\u00e1ttr uxaf\u00f3ts ** S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** Stefnis \u00fe\u00e1ttr \u00deorgilssonar ** R\u00f6gnvalds \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok Rau\u00f0s ** Hallfre\u00f0ar \u00fe\u00e1ttr vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1lds ** Kjartans \u00fe\u00e1ttr \u00d3lafssonar ** \u00d6gmundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr dytts ** Norna- Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** Helga \u00fe\u00e1ttr \u00de\u00f3rissonar ** \u00deorvalds \u00fe\u00e1ttr tasalda ** Sveins \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok Finns ** Rau\u00f0s \u00fe\u00e1ttr hins ramma ** Hr\u00f3mundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr halta ** \u00deorsteins \u00fe\u00e1ttr skelks ** \u00dei\u00f0randa \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok \u00de\u00f3rhalls ** Kristni \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** Eir\u00edks \u00fe\u00e1ttr rau\u00f0a ** Sva\u00f0a \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok Arn\u00f3rs kerlingarnefs ** Eindri\u00f0a \u00fe\u00e1ttr ilbrei\u00f0s ** Orms \u00fe\u00e1ttr St\u00f3r\u00f3lfssonar ** H\u00e1lfdanar \u00fe\u00e1ttr svarta ** Haralds \u00fe\u00e1ttr h\u00e1rfagra ** Hauks \u00fe\u00e1ttr h\u00e1br\u00f3kar * \u00d3lafs saga helga, including: ** F\u00f3stbr\u0153\u00f0ra saga ** Orkneyinga saga ** F\u00e6reyinga saga ** N\u00f3regs konungatal ** Haralds \u00fe\u00e1ttr grenska ** \u00d3lafs \u00fe\u00e1ttr Geirsta\u00f0a\u00e1lfs ** Styrbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Sv\u00edakappa ** Hr\u00f3a \u00fe\u00e1ttr heimska ** Eymundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr hrings ** T\u00f3ka \u00fe\u00e1ttr T\u00f3kasonar ** \u00cdsleifs \u00fe\u00e1ttr biskups ** Eymundar \u00fe\u00e1ttr af Sk\u00f6rum ** Eindri\u00f0a \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok Erlings ** \u00c1sbjarnar \u00fe\u00e1ttr Selsbana ** Kn\u00fats \u00fe\u00e1ttr hins r\u00edka ** Steins \u00fe\u00e1ttr Skaptasonar ** Rau\u00f0\u00falfs \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** V\u00f6lsa \u00fe\u00e1ttr ** Brenna Adams byskups * Sverris saga * H\u00e1konar saga H\u00e1konarsonar * An addendum to \u00d3lafs saga helga by Styrmir K\u00e1rason * A saga of King Magnus the Good and King Harald Hardrada of the Morkinskinna type * Hemings \u00fe\u00e1ttr \u00c1sl\u00e1kssonar * Au\u00f0unar \u00fe\u00e1ttr vestfirzka * Sneglu-Halla \u00fe\u00e1ttr * Halld\u00f3rs \u00fe\u00e1ttr Snorrasonar * \u00deorsteins \u00fe\u00e1ttr forvitna * \u00deorsteins \u00fe\u00e1ttr tjaldst\u00e6\u00f0ings * Bl\u00f3\u00f0-Egils \u00fe\u00e1ttr * Gr\u0153nlendinga \u00fe\u00e1ttr (not to be confused with Gr\u0153nlendinga saga) * Helga \u00fe\u00e1ttr ok \u00dalfs * J\u00e1tvar\u00f0ar saga helga \u2013 Saga of King Edward * Flateyjarann\u00e1lar == Modern translations == Flateyjarb\u00f3k is currently being translated into English by the Saga Heritage Foundation of Norway.
