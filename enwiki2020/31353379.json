    "text": "Lichtburg (\"fortress of light\" or \"light castle\") has been a popular name for cinemas in Germany. Those in Berlin, Essen and D\u00fcsseldorf have been particularly famous; the Lichtburg in Oberhausen is the site of the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and Quernheim is the smallest municipality in Germany with a cinema, also called Lichtburg. ==D\u00fcsseldorf== The D\u00fcsseldorf Lichtburg opened on 5 November 1910 as the \"Lichtspiele K\u00f6nigsallee\" (K\u00f6nigsallee Moving Pictures, for the name of the street).Lichtburg, D\u00fcsseldorf (Nordrhein-Westfalen), K\u00f6nigsallee 38\u201340, allekinos.com, retrieved 3 April 2011 It was designed by Oskar Rosendahl, a local architect who the following year published an influential article in Der Kinomatograph in which he laid out guidelines for cinema design such as an inviting foyer with cloakrooms through which the public would be drawn rapidly into the auditorium, an equally good view from all seats, achieved by a raked floor and a screen raised at least 2.5 metres off the floor, and toilets within easy reach to minimise disturbances.Joachim Steffen, Jens Thiele and Bernd Poch (eds.), Spurensuche: Film und Kino in der Region.

(Union Theater) K\u00f6nigsallee in 1931, and finally the Lichtburg, also in 1931. Throughout its years as a cinema, the fa\u00e7ade retained a stone archway over the doorway and a group of small windows above. The semicircular canopy bore the name Lichtburg in large letters, changing position and script slightly over the years.Die Lichtburg in den 20iger & 30iger Jahren, Lichtburg D\u00fcsseldorf with historic photographs; retrieved 3 April 2011.

It had 2,000 upholstered seats with an electrical system which sent a message to the cashier when the seat was occupied, and a 150,000 Reichsmark Wurlitzer organ, at the time the largest in any European cinema,Film-Dienst: \"Man lauschte der in der damaligen Stummfilmzeit gr\u00f6\u00dften Wurlitzer-Orgel Europas\". with sound effects including traffic noise and thunder. The 30-person orchestra was drawn in part from the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra.

During World War II, the building was almost completely destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943. The auditorium was completely destroyed by fire, but the walls remained standing. Responding to a newspaper advertisement placed by the city of Essen, Heinrich Jaeck and Erich Menz, who had run several cinemas in the city, became the new operators almost two years after the war. In 1948-50, the cinema was rebuilt in contemporary style, with approximately 1,700 seats. It reopened on 23 March 1950;, p. 115 the mayor, , gave a speech and Gustav Heinemann, later to be President of the Republic, and Willi Forst, the director of the featured film, Wiener M\u00e4deln, were both present. In the 1950s, the Lichtburg in Essen was the foremost cinema for film premi\u00e8res in Germany. Its importance declined with the increasing popularity of television and increasing economic hardship in the Ruhr region. However, unlike most cinemas in Essen, it survived as a result of its size and stage facilities. In 1991 the German cinema chain Cinemaxx opened the largest multiplex in Germany nearby. The building was in need of renovations and in 1994 it was suggested it should instead be demolished and the central site used in some other way. In 1998 the Essener Filmkunsttheater GmbH (Essen Cinema Art Theatre) acquired the building and it received landmark protection.On 17 December 1998: Kettwiger Str. 036 / I.

It was decided to relocate a community college and investors were found. The building was comprehensively rebuilt to historic building standards in 1950s style in a 7 million Euro project. The tea room became the film bar and the 1970s Atelier-Theater became the Blue Salon. The college building was designed by Hartmut Miksch and Wolfgang R\u00fccker. The college now uses most of the office space in the Lichtburg building itself. The cinema reopened on 16 March 2003 and now has modern sound and video equipment and is once again the site of many premi\u00e8res.\"Ruhr 2010: Auf Stahl gebaut\", Manager magazin 23 February 2010 The main auditorium now seats 1,250 and is still the largest cinema auditorium in Germany.Markus von Scheele, \"Seele kostet extra\", Der Spiegel 8 October 2007, (pdf) with pictures of Cinemaxx and of Lichtburg interior.

It was designed by Rudolf Fr\u00e4nkel as the centrepiece of his housing development in Gesundbrunnen (Fr\u00e4nkel's first project as an independent architectProgressive Architecture 32 (1981) p. 88.) and was next to the Gesundbrunnen station. It seated 2,000 and was part of an entertainment complex which also contained spaces for dancing and banqueting, meeting rooms, restaurants, bars, cafes, shops and a bowling alley.Die Anlage historisch ..., Gartenstadt Atlantic It was one of the most important cinemas in Germany.According to Franziska Nentwig (ed.), Berlin im Licht , exhibition catalogue, Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin, Berlin: G & H, 2008, , p. 6 (pdf) the best known of the \"cinema palaces\" in Berlin. Architecturally, the Berlin Lichtburg was of international significance., p. 13 names it as one of 6 Berlin cinemas with that status, and uses it for the cover picture. The building was distinguished by the interplay of verticals and horizontals, p. 102: \"Dieses Spiel horizontaler und vertikaler Elemente erinnert an Fr\u00e4nkels erstes Projekt, das Kino Lichtburg in der Gartenstadt Atlantic, bei dem der zylindrischer Turm ein Gegengewicht zu den horizontalen B\u00e4ndern der Geb\u00e4udefl\u00fcgel bildete.\" [This play of horizontal and vertical elements recalls Fr\u00e4nkel's first project, the Lichtburg cinema in the Gartenstadt Atlantic, in which the cylindrical tower acted as a counterbalance to the horizontal banding of the building's wings.] and recalled works by other avant garde architects of the period such as Erich MendelsohnDieter Bartetzko, Illusionen in Stein: Stimmungsarchitektur im deutschen Faschismus. Ihre Vorgeschichte in Theater- und Film-Bauten, Rororo Sachbuch: Kulturen und Ideen, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1985, , p. 180 in its expressive use of curves and mostly horizontal divisions. It consisted of two horizontally defined wings, 5 and 4 storeys high, between which the main body of the cinema was located. A 22.5 metre high rotunda positioned at the street corner contained the foyer and event spaces and was topped by a glass roof pavilion; the cinema was given pride of place.Rolf-Peter Baacke, Lichtspielhausarchitektur in Deutschland: von der Schaubude bis zum Kinopalast, Berlin: Fr\u00f6lich & Kaufmann, 1982, , p. 44 In the auditorium, the decor featured mahogany, wine-red upholstery and swooping curves.. The new building received praise in the architectural press for its innovative and successful technical realisation and use of space, including two-sided access to the cloakrooms so that entering and leaving people did not hinder each other. The Berlin Lichtburg was also a prime example of German architecture of the night (Architektur der Nacht) or Light Architecture (Licht-Architektur).Marion Ackermann and Dietrich Neumann (eds.), Leuchtende Bauten: Architektur der Nacht, exhibition catalogue, Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz, 2006, , p. 117 , p. 82 cites it as one of two examples: \"The exteriors of the and the Lichtburg, Berlin, ... were built to demonstrate 'night architecture'.\"In this Kathleen James-Chakraborty, German Architecture for a Mass Audience, London: Routledge, 2000, , p. 70 (misreading the name as Lichtberg) relates it to work by Bruno Taut: \"For Rudolf Fr\u00e4nkel, the architect of the Lichtberg (Mountain of Light) Cinema ... for instance, dramatic night lighting established the basic continuity between this building, the centerpiece of a new working-class housing settlement, and Taut's earlier city crown projects\". At night, the rotunda's 15 vertical bands of windows were illuminated by approximately 1,500 light bulbs each,BF- Architekten, \"Modernisierung Wohnanlage Gartenstadt Atlantic, Berlin\", p. 2 (pdf) red illuminated letters 1.2 metres high spelled out \"Lichtburg\" above the roofline, and 3 rotating searchlights mounted on the roof raked the sky from under them. In addition to drawing attention to itself amongst the residential buildings, the building thus embodied the principle of cinema \u2013 the projection of light into the darkness. The night-time appearance of the cinema was widely depicted and probably influenced Cecil Clavering's striking design for the Odeon in Kingstanding, with its tall central fins on which the architect originally intended a searchlight to be mounted.Allen Eyles, Odeon Cinemas, 2 volumes, volume 1: Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation, London: Cinema Theatre Association, British Film Institute, 2002, , p. 57.: \"The original idea was for a searchlight to be mounted on the fins which would scan the night sky, like at the Lichtburg in Berlin. This idea was dropped when Deutsch took over [the cinema]\". During the Nazi period, the singer Walter Kirchhoff operated the building as an opera venue.Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik 101 (1934) pp. 891, 1030-31 In 1937, with the aid of American Jewish investors, Karl Wolffsohn, the former owner of the Essen Lichtburg, gained financial control of the Gartenstadt Atlantic in an attempt to remain operator of the Berlin Lichtburg,Filmexil Volumes 17\u201322, p. 54 Irene Stratenwerth and Hermann Simon (eds.), Pioniere in Celluloid: Juden in der fr\u00fchen Filmwelt, companion book to exhibit in the Centrum Judaicum, Berlin: Henschel, 2004, , p. 25 but in 1939 he was stripped of it under Nazi policy. The building was badly damaged late in World War II. Soviet occupying forces then used the foyer to stable their horses. It received basic repairs and reopened in 1947 as the Corso, initially presenting operettas.\"Theater am laufenden Band: Kurf\u00fcrstendamm bis Gesundbrunnen\", Der Spiegel 10 January 1948 In 1961 it was redesigned by M. A. Elsner. In this incarnation it had 1,933 seats and was less tall and more modestly decorated. Its location in the French sector of occupied Berlin, close to the border with the Soviet sector, attracted large audiences from East Berlin until the building of the Berlin Wall divided the city, after which the isolated location of the district led to the closure of the cinema in 1962. The Berlin Senate used the building to store food as part of the Senate Reserve, but in 1970 it was demolished to make way for redevelopment. It is now commemorated in the Lichtburgforum, which is named for it and attempts to replace some of its functions in the community,Partner des Mikrokosmos: Gewerbliche und nicht gewerbliche, Gartenstadt Atlantic: \"Das Lichtburgforum ist das Zentrum des Mikrokosmos ... Im Lichtburgforum wird versucht, ein wenig an diese Glanzzeit des Gesundbrunnens anzukn\u00fcpfen.\" [The Lichtburgforum is the centre of the microcosm [that is the Gartenstadt Atlantic] ... In the Lichtburgforum the attempt is made to access somewhat that period of glory in Gesundbrunnen.] and the Lichtburg-Stiftung (Lichtburg Foundation), which was founded to finance cultural activities in the Gartenstadt Atlantic. ==Oberhausen== Entrance to the Lichtburg Filmpalast in Oberhausen The International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, founded in 1954, moved in 1998 into the Lichtburg Filmpalast, which has 5 auditoria: the Lichtburg, Gloria, Sunset, Star and Studio.Kino \u2013 Ausstattung, Lichtburg Filmpalast , retrieved 3 April 2011. The cinema opened on 13 March 1931 with 1,200 seats. It was destroyed by bombing in World War II. In 1949 the \"Little Lichtburg\" opened; this later became the Gloria. On 13 May 1952 the new Lichtburg opened with 872 seats arranged for optimal viewing, 150 of them with extra-deep upholstery. The auditorium also has a theatrical stage.
