    "text": "This is a list of English flags, including symbolic national and sub-national flags, standards and banners used exclusively in England. The College of Arms is the authority on the flying of flags in England and maintains the only official register of flags. It was established in 1484 and as part of the Royal Household operates under the authority of The Crown. A separate private body called the Flag Institute, financed by its own membership, also maintains a registry of United Kingdom flags that it styles 'the UK Flag Registry', though this has no official status under English law. Certain classes of flag enjoy a special status within English planning law and can be flown without needing planning permission as advertisements. These include any country\u2019s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensign; the flag of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations or any other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member; a flag of any island, county, district, borough, burgh, parish, city, town or village within the United Kingdom; the flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire, any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom; the flag of St David; the flag of St Patrick; the flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United Kingdom; any flag of Her Majesty\u2019s Forces; and the Armed Forces Day flag. ==National flag== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!! style=\"width:500px;\"|Description |- | || From c. 1245 ||Flag of England (also known as the St George's Cross) || A centred red cross on a white background, 3:5.[ Flag of England] |} ==Royal Standards== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!! style=\"width:500px;\"|Description |- | || 1837 || Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.
