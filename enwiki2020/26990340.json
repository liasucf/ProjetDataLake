The preamble of the resolution expressed dissatisfaction over international terrorism which resulted in innocent deaths, the deterioration of international relations and put the security of countries at risk. There was a need to strengthen international co-operation in adopting measures to prevent, combat and eliminate all forms of terrorism. The Council noted OAU's earlier considering the attack as aimed not only at Mobarak, but at the sovereignty of Ethiopia, and at Africa as a whole. It was regretting that Sudan had not complied with OAU requests to extradite suspects. The Security Council condemned the assassination attempt and deplored the violation of Ethiopia's sovereignty and the attempt to disturb the peace and security in that country and the region as a whole. The efforts of Ethiopia to resolve the issue bilaterally and regionally was welcomed, while Sudan was called upon to extradite the 3 suspects to Ethiopia in accordance with the 1964 Extradition Treaty between both countries, and not to support forms of terrorism or shelter terrorist suspects. The international community were urged to encourage Sudan respond positively to the OAU's requests, while the Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report on the situation within 60 days to the Council. After Sudan refused to comply, it was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1054 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1070. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Egypt * Foreign relations of Ethiopia * Foreign relations of Sudan * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) ==References== ==External links== *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org Category:1996 in Ethiopia Category:1996 in Sudan 1044 1044 1044 1044 Category:January 1996 events ",
