    "text": "Jacobus \"Japie\" Basson (25 July 1918 \u2013 8 August 2012) was a South African politician who began his career with the National Party, but was later expelled from it, and became a forceful critic of the apartheid government as a member, by turns, of the United Party, Progressive Federal Party, and his own short-lived National Union. He was described as \"fiery\", \"colourful\", an \"individualist\", and as the \"chameleon\" of South African politics for his shifting partisan allegiances. He was originally elected to the House of Assembly in 1950 as MP for the constituency of Namib, in what was then South African-administered South West Africa, before leaving the National Party in 1959. In 1960, he co-founded the South West Party with Ferdinand Lempp, former editor of Allgemeine Zeitung, the German language daily newspaper in the territory.A Glance at Our Africa: Facsimile Reprint of Southwest News--Suidwes Nuus, 1960, Dag Henrichsen, Basler Afrika Bibliographien, 1997, page 67 However, he later founded his own party, the National Union, which despite its opposition to many aspects of the apartheid policies of Hendrik Verwoerd, supported his government's decision to make South Africa a republic, although he declared that a republic would do Verwoerd himself no good.Africa, Issues 2-24, page 68 Basson was elected as MP for Bezuidenhout in Johannesburg in 1961,Stellenbosch Writers: Stellenbosch Authors of Books, Rosemarie Breuer, Jill Adams, Stellenbosch Writers Publishers, 2005, page 6 before merging it with the United Party, for which he served as its foreign affairs spokesman.The South West Africa/Namibia Dispute: Documents and Scholarly Writings on the Controversy Between South Africa and the United Nations, John Dugard, University of California Press, 1973, page 534 Following the collapse of that party, Basson led the Committee for a United Opposition, which merged with the more liberal Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party.The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970-1980, South African Democracy Education Trust, Unisa Press, 2004, page 849 In 1980, in the wake of disagreements with the PFP over support for the constitutional reforms of the government of P W Botha, he was expelled from the party caucus.South African Digest, Department of Information, 1980, page 99 This was because he had stated that he was prepared to serve on the President's Council, a body established by the Botha government to advise on a new constitution.To the Point News in Depth, Volume 9, Issues 18-35, page cxxxvii Earlier, his party had adopted a resolution rejecting the body.A Survey of Race Relations in South Africa, Volume 34, South African Institute of Race Relations, 1980, page 18 He was appointed to the President's Council, serving as a member of its Constitutional Committee from 1981 to 1984, and on retirement from the Council, rejoined the National Party.Divided or United Power: Views on the New Constitutional Dispensation, J.
