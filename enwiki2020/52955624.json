    "text": "Hareskoven or Hareskovene (plural) is a forested area straddling the boundary between Fures\u00f8 and Gladsaxe municipalities in the northwestern suburbs of Copenhagen, Denmark. F\u00e6gyden, a road between Hareskovby and V\u00e6rl\u00f8se, separates Store Hareskov in the west from Lille Hareskov to the west. The forested area has a combined area of c. 808 hectares. ==History== The first part of the name (Hare- or Harre-) is derived from the Norse word H\u00f6rgr, meaning altar or cult site. Hareskov was severely damaged during the Swedish Wars in the late 1650s. At the end of the war it was concluded that \"the forest will only be able to feed 90 pigs\". It was therefore protected for the next few years while it recovered. ==Ecology== Harskov consists mainly of beech forest with scattered oak, linden and maple trees. Notable solitaire trees include the three ancient oak trees Skr\u00e6dderen \"The Tailor\"), Grenaderen and Dj\u00e6velen /\"The Devil\"). The latter used to look like a devil's hand reaching out for the sky. It was partly destroyed in a storm in 1981 but is still alive. ==Historic features== Hareskoven contains a total of six dolmens from the Stone Age. The largest one is located close to Sandskredshus at Skovbrynet station. Two examples of earthworks from the Swedish Ears known as Lejrens Indelukke and Svenskervolden can still be seen in the southern part of the forest. ==Activities== Hareskoven forest contains a network of bridle paths for horseback riding as well as a trail for mountain biking. ==References== ==External links== * Hareskovene Category:Forests of Greater Copenhagen Category:Fures\u00f8 Municipality Category:Gladsaxe Municipality ",
