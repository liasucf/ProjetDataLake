    "text": "Clifford Alan Pickover (born August 15, 1957) is an American author, editor, and columnist in the fields of science, mathematics, science fiction, innovation, and creativity. For many years, he was employed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York where he was Editor-in-Chief of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. He has been granted more than 700 U.S. patents, is an elected Fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and is author of more than 50 books, translated into more than a dozen languages. Pickover.com == Biography == Pickover's works have often dealt with higher dimensions, computer art, and visualization. Pickover was elected as a Fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry for his \u201csignificant contributions to the general public\u2019s understanding of science, reason, and critical inquiry through their scholarship, writing, and work in the media.\u201dHall and Novella Join Executive Council, Plus New Fellows & Consultants Elected, Skeptical Inquirer News, 2012 Other Fellows have included Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov. He has been awarded almost 700 United States patents, and his The Math Book was winner of the 2011 Neumann Prize. He received his Ph.D. in 1982 from Yale University's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, where he conducted research on X-ray scattering and protein structure. Pickover graduated first in his class from Franklin and Marshall College, after completing the four-year undergraduate program in three years.Clifford A. Pickover \u2013 Biographical Sketch. Retrieved July 8, 2008. He joined IBM at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1982, as a member of the speech synthesis group and later worked on the design-automation workstations.Clifford A. Pickover (1986). \"DNA vectorgrams\". In: IBM J. RES. DEVELOP Vol 31 no 1, January 1987. For much of his career, Pickover has published technical articles in the areas of scientific visualization, computer art, and recreational mathematics. He is currently an associate editor for the scientific journal Computers and Graphics and is an editorial board member for Odyssey and Leonardo. He is also the Brain-Strain columnist for Odyssey magazine, and, for many years, he was the Brain-Boggler columnist for Discover magazine. Pickover has received more than 100 IBM invention achievement awards, three research division awards, and four external honor awards. == Work == In the 1990s, Pickover created virtual caverns from extremely simple numerical simulations that reminded him of the Lechuguilla Cave, pictured here.\"Virtual Cavern\".

In The Math Book and his companion book The Physics Book, Pickover explains that both mathematics and physics \"cultivate a perpetual state of wonder about the limits of thoughts, the workings of the universe, and our place in the vast space-time landscape that we call home.\" Pickover, Clifford A.

Pickover is an inventor with over 700 patents, the author of puzzle calendars, and puzzle contributor to magazines geared to children and adults.

On November 4, 2006, he began Wikidumper.org, a popular blog featuring articles being considered for deletion by English Wikipedia. === Pickover stalks === Pickover stalks are certain kinds of details that are empirically found in the Mandelbrot set in the study of fractal geometry. In the 1980s, Pickover proposed that experimental mathematicians and computer artists examine the behavior of orbit trajectories for the Mandelbrot in order to study how closely the orbits of interior points come to the x and y axes in the complex plane. In some renditions of this behavior, the closer that the point approaches, the higher up the color scale, with red denoting the closest approach. The logarithm of the distance is taken to accentuate the details. This work grew from his earlier work with Julia sets and \"Pickover biomorphs,\" the latter of which often resembled microbes.Linas Vepstas (1997). \"Interior Sketchbook Diary\". Retrieved July 8, 2008.\"Images of Biormorphs\". Retrieved August 17, 2008. === Frontiers of Scientific Visualization === In \"Frontiers of Scientific Visualization\" (1994) Pickover explored \"the art and science of making the unseen workings of nature visible\". The books contains contributions on \"Fluid flow, fractals, plant growth, genetic sequencing, the configuration of distant galaxies, virtual reality to artistic inspiration\", and focuses on use of computers as tools for simulation, art and discovery.C.A. Pickover and S. Tewksbury (ed.) (1994). Frontiers of Scientific Visualization, Wiley, March 1, 1994. === Visualizing Biological Information === In \"Visualizing Biological Information\" (1995) Pickover considered \"biological data of all kinds, which is proliferating at an incredible rate\". According to Pickover, \"if humans attempt to read such data in the form of numbers and letters, they will take in the information at a snail's pace. If the information is rendered graphically, however, human analysts can assimilate it and gain insight much faster. The emphasis of this work is on the novel graphical and musical representation of information containing sequences, such as DNA and amino acid sequences, to help us find hidden pattern and meaning\".C.A. Pickover, C. (1995). Visualizing Biological Information. World Scientific. === Vampire numbers and other mathematical highlights === In mathematics, a vampire number or true vampire number is a composite natural number v, with an even number of digits n, that can be factored into two integers x and y each with n/2 digits and not both with trailing zeroes, where v contains all the digits from x and from y, in any order. x and y are called the fangs. As an example, 1260 is a vampire number because it can be expressed as 21 \u00d7 60 = 1260. Note that the digits of the factors 21 and 60 can be found, in some scrambled order, in 1260. Similarly, 136,948 is a vampire because 136,948 = 146 \u00d7 938. Vampire numbers first appeared in a 1994 post by Clifford A. Pickover to the Usenet group sci.math, and the article he later wrote was published in chapter 30 of his book Keys to Infinity.Pickover, Clifford A. (1995). Keys to Infinity. Wiley. In addition to \u201cVampire numbers\u201d,\"Vampire Number\".

Retrieved August 14, 2008. === Culture, religion, belief === Starting in about 2001, Pickover's books sometimes began to include topics beyond his traditional focus on science and mathematics. For example, Dreaming the Future discusses various methods of divination that humans have used since stone-age times. The Paradox of God deals with topics in religion. Perhaps the most obvious departure from his earlier works includes Sex, Drugs, Einstein, and Elves: Sushi, Psychedelics, Parallel Universes, and the Quest for Transcendence, which explores the \u201cborderlands of science\u201d and is \u201cpart memoir and part surrealist perspective on culture.\u201d.Pickover, C., Sex, Drugs, Einstein, and Elves: Sushi, Psychedelics, Parallel Universes, and the Quest for Transcendence, 2005 Pickover follows-up his \u201cquest for transcendence\u201d and examination of popular culture with A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Immortality: Extraordinary People, Alien Brains, and Quantum Resurrection. === History of science and mathematics === Starting in 2008, Pickover's books began to focus on the history of science and mathematics, with such titles as Archimedes to Hawking, as well as The Math Book, The Physics Book, and The Medical Book\u2014a trilogy of more than 1,500 pages that presents various historical milestones, breakthroughs, and curiosities. === WikiDumper.org === Wikidumper.org is a website created by Pickover that promises to permanently record a snapshot of the \"best of the English Wikipedia rejects\", articles that are slated for deletion at the English Wikipedia. WikiDumper was launched on November 4, 2006, and accepts user submissions. Although the site doesn't specify its criteria for inclusion, many of its articles don't cite their sources. The site has been criticized as likely to be less accurate than English Wikipedia. == Publications == Visualization of chaotic attractor. Pickover's earliest books often focused on patterns that characterize mathematics such as fractals, chaos, and number theory. Computer graphics, reminiscent of this chaotic attractor, were common in his early works. Forest troll. (Theodor Kittelsen, 1906). Some of Pickover's later books often discussed \"science at the edges,\" including such topics as parallel universes, quantum immortality, alien life, and elf-like beings seen by some people who use dimethyltryptamine. Pickover is author of over forty books on such topics as computers and creativity, art, mathematics, black holes, human behavior and intelligence, time travel, alien life, Albert Einstein, religion, dimethyltryptamine elves, parallel universes, the nature of genius, and science fiction.\"Cliff Pickover's home page\" .
