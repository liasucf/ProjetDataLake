He comes from a long line of Olympic champions. Bida's maternal grandmother, Valentina Rastvorova, won team gold and individual silver in women's foil in 1960 in Rome, as well as team silver in 1964 in Tokyo. His maternal grandfather, Boris Grishin, won Olympic silver in 1968 in Mexico City and Olympic bronze in 1964 in Tokyo in water polo. His maternal uncle, Yevgeny Grishin, won Olympic water polo gold in 1980 in Moscow and Olympic water polo bronze in 1988 in Seoul. His mother is Yelena Grishina, a two time finalist in Olympic foil. Sergey Bida was originally set to follow in his grandfather and uncle's footsteps in competitive water polo, however he got a severe case of sinusitus when he was twelve years old that prevented him from getting in the pool. He took up epee instead as he was too old to begin in other sports. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Russian male fencers Category:Russian \u00e9p\u00e9e fencers Category:Universiade medalists in fencing Category:Universiade gold medalists for Russia Category:European Games competitors for Russia Category:European Games silver medalists for Russia Category:European Games medalists in fencing Category:Fencers at the 2015 European Games Category:Martial artists from Moscow Category:Medalists at the 2017 Summer Universiade ",
