Williams was a self-made multimillionaire who began his career in the 1960s with the creation of a water skiing park in Surfers Paradise. This was followed by a raceway, Seaworld, and Hamilton Island, Daydream Island and Port Hinchinbrook in the Whitsunday Islands. Williams earned a reputation as both a visionary and a pioneer, and as the bane of environmentalists. He was born in Brisbane on 22 September 1929. He left school aged 13 and by aged 16 had started his first business. By 19, he was making products licensed by Walt Disney in a self-built factory at Bulimba with 50 employees. By age 30 Williams was an Australian water-skiing champion and in 1963 married a former TV star and later Miss Gold Coast. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Queensland Category:Australian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George ",
