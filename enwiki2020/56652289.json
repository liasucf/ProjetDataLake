Two single round-robin stages were held, and winners of each stage determined the champion in the post-season home and away championship playoffs. After five seasons, the JFL reverted to a one-stage double round- robin starting in 2019. ==League table== ==Top scorers== .http://www.jfl.or.jp/jfl-pc/view/s.php?a=1275 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:central\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Goals |- | 1 | Shogo Omachi |Honda FC | 18 |- | 2 | Koji Ishihara |Tokyo Musashino City FC | 17 |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 3 | Shogo Fujimaki |Veertien Mie |rowspan=\"2\"| 16 |- | Motoki Fujiwara |Sony Sendai FC |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 5 | Kazuki Sakamoto |MIO Biwako Shiga |rowspan=\"2\"| 15 |- | Jun Arima |FC Imabari |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 7 | Shota Suzuki |Sony Sendai FC |rowspan=\"2\"| 14 |- | Ry\u014dta Kuwajima |FC Imabari |- | 9 | Sachio Hamada |ReinMeer Aomori FC | 13 |- | 10 | Shoma Mizunaga |Tegevajaro Miyazaki | 12 |} == Attendances == ==References== ==External links== *Official Site (in Japanese) * * *JFLChannel (in Japanese) *Unofficial news site (in Japanese) Category:Japan Football League seasons 3 ",
