The previous era ended and the new one commenced in Engi 23, on the 11th day of the intercalary 4th month of 923.Brown, p. 292; Varley, p. 179. ==Events of the Ench\u014d era== * 929 (Ench\u014d 7, 8th month): Floods devastated the country and many perished.Titsingh, p. 134. * July 24, 930 (Ench\u014d 8, 26th day of the 6th month): A huge black storm cloud traveled from the slopes of Mt. Atago to Heian-ky\u014d accompanied by frightful thunder. Lightning struck the Imperial Palace. Both Senior Counselor Fuijwara- no Kiyotsura (also known as Miyoshi no Kiyoyuki) and Middle Controller of the Right Taira-no Mareyo and many other subaltern officers were killed and their bodies were consumed in the subsequent fires. The deaths were construed as an act of revenge by the unsettled spirit of the late Sugawara no Michizane.Titsingh, p. 134; Brown, p. 293; Varley, p. 179\u2013181. * October 16, 930 (Ench\u014d 8, 22nd day of the 9th month): In the 34th year of Daigo-tenn\u014d 's reign (\u918d\u9190\u5929\u768734\u5e74), the emperor fell ill; and, fearing that he might not survive, Daigo abdicated. At this point, the succession (senso) was said to have been received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Suzaku is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Brown, p. 293; Varley, p. 44. * October 23, 930 (Ench\u014d 8, 29th day of the 9th month): Emperor Daigo entered the Buddhist priesthood in the very early morning hours. As a monk, he took the Buddhist name H\u014d-kong\u014d; and shortly thereafter, this humble monk died at the age of 46.Titsingh, p. 134; Brown, p. 292. This monk was buried in the precincts of Daigo-ji, which is why the former-emperor's posthumous name became Daigo- tenn\u014d. ==Notes== ==References== * Brown, Delmer M. and Ichir\u014d Ishida, eds.
