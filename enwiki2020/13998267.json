The ROKAF Aerobatic Team has operated in various occasions of national ceremonies. The permanent team was initially formed on December 12, 1994 and flew six Cessna A-37B Dragonfly airplanes. The team disbanded temporarily after the 2007 Seoul Air Show and reformed upon the arrival of their new T-50 Golden Eagle aircraft code-named as T-50B in 2010. ==History== T-50Bs at the Royal International Air Tattoo in 2012 The Republic of Korea Air Force Black Eagles aerobatic team has operated in various occasions of national ceremonies and at international air shows. The original display team was formed on October 1, 1953 and operated four P-51 Mustangs. In October, 1956 a new display team the T-33A Show Flight Team was formed. On October 1, 1959 a new display team was formed. This team was called the Blue Sabre and they flew four F-86 Sabre jet airplanes. This team was disbanded in 1966. In 1967, a new display team, the Black Eagles, was formed. It operated between 1966 through 1978 and flew seven Northrop F-5A Freedom Fighters. From 1966 to 1969 the aircraft were F-5As. Flying was suspended from 1970 to 1972, and from 1973 to 1978 the aircraft used were RF-5As. In 1978 the team was disbanded in order to enhance defense preparedness. The full-time aerobatic team, the Black Eagles, was re-established as the 2nd flight of the 238th Fighter Squadron, the 8th Fighter Wing on December 12, 1994 and flew six Cessna A-37B Dragonfly airplanes. On April 1, 1999 the flight was detached from the 238 FS, and became the 239th Aerobatic Flight Squadron. After the Seoul Air Show in 2007, the Black Eagles team was temporarily disbanded on October 31, 2007 for transitioning to their new T-50 Golden Eagle. The farewell flight mission was directed by Gen. KIM Eun-gi, Air force Chief of Staff on October 10, 2007. The reformation was scheduled for 2010, but ahead of schedule in time, the Black Eagles was re-established on August 2009, and performed an air show to fly over Seoul on September 23, 2009 to commemorate the Republic of Korean Airforce (ROKAF) 60th anniversary. On July 1, 2012 the Black Eagles was awarded the Boeing Trophy for best display at the 17th Waddington International Air Show. On July 8, 2012, the Black Eagles were awarded the King Hussein Memorial Sword, for the Best Overall Flying Demonstration and the As The Crow Flies Trophy at the awards ceremony of the Royal International Air Tattoo, on their first appearance at the airshow. On April 1, 2013, the squadron was authorized to expand to an independent group level, the 53rd Air Demonstration Group, including the 239th squadron and its dedicated maintenance flights, was established under the direct control of the ROKAF Headquarters. Now the Black Eagles are not commanded by the 8th Fighter Wing, but the group is still based at Wonju AB alongside its ex-parent unit and supported by the wing's logistics and support units. ==Aircraft== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"text-align: center;\"| Aircraft ! style=\"text-align: center;\"| Origin ! style=\"text-align: center;\"| Number of aircraft ! style=\"text-align: center;\"| Dates of service ! style=\"text-align: center;\"| Notes |- |North American Aviation F-51 Mustang || || 4 || 1953\u20131954 || aircraft F-51D.

Air Power Day was a two-day event that highlighted the partnership between the Republic of Korea and the U.S. military. The Black Eagles' T-50B is painted in yellow, white, and black. It is equipped with an internal smoke generation system which creates a thick smoke trail. The aircraft is basically the same as the original T-50 except for the smoke generation system, several cameras, and two wingtip visible lights. ===Smoke=== The thick smoke trails of the Black Eagles aerobatic team are made by releasing diesel and oil into the exhaust nozzle; this mixture immediately oxidizes, leaving a white smoke trail. There are two smoke tanks in the aircraft, each designed to carry about 60 gallon of smoke oil. The smoke system can control the quantity of oil released, so each aircraft can trail smoke for seven to twenty minutes. == Maneuver == The Black Eagles group demonstrates organized teamwork and sophisticated flight skills. The display is composed of about 30 aerobatic maneuvers. The team has a total of eight aircraft in formation. Formations with 4~8 aircraft usually show grandeur and sophistication at the same time. One to four plane maneuvers show thrills and excitement. During an aerobatics display, pilots experience forces up to 4 to 5 g's, and when performing the aerobatic maneuver 'Maximum maneuver', forces up to 11 g (the structural limit of the aircraft). ===2017 Full Display (High Show) Sequence=== * 1.
