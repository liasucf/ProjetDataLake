    "text": "The Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) is the party's highest decision-making body. The LPRP has convened 10 congresses since its foundation in 1955, and eight since taking power in 1975. According to the party rules, the party congress is to be convened by the LPRP Central Committee (CC) every fifth year. It functions as a forum that approves party policy (such as the five-year plans), is empowered to amend the party's charter and program, and elects the Central Committee. The party leadership, through the Political Report of the Central Committee, briefs the party on its work in the period since its last congress, and sets out future goals for the period in between the next congress. The congress was always convened in March from the 5th Congress in 1991 to the 9th Congress in 2011. According to Martin Sturt-Fox, this suggests an ideological cohesion within the party and its leadership. The 4th Congress introduced the \"New Economic Mechanism\" (NEM, market reforms). Partly for introducing NEM, the 4th Congress is the last congress to be postponed due to political infighting. Due to the party's secret nature, it's hard to discern the work and the political intrigues which takes place before the congress. In the run-up to party congresses, outside observers try to discern factional intrigues, usually between two supposedly \"pro-Chinese\" and \"pro-Vietnamese\" or \"pro-reform\" and \"anti-reform\" camps. Despite this, there seems to be broad agreement within the party on the path its pursuing: that is, creating a socialist market economic model and attracting foreign direct investment. ==Keys== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Abbreviations |- |CC |Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party |- |FM |Full member (a member with voting rights). |- |AM |Alternate member (a member without voting rights). |- |Political Report |Political Report to the Central Committee, a document which briefs delegates about the period since the last Congress and future work. |- |PMR |Party members represented at the congress by delegates (the party membership at the time). |} ==Convocations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Congress ! scope=\"col\" | Duration (start\u2014end) ! scope=\"col\" | Delegates ! scope=\"col\" | CC elected ! scope=\"col\" | Political Report (presented by) ! scope=\"col\" | PMR |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font- weight:normal;\" | 1st Congress 1 day None | 22 March 1955 | 25 | 5 | None | ~400 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 2nd Congress 4 days 1972 election |3 February \u2013 6 February 1972 | 125 | 21 FM \u2013 6 AM | Kaysone Phomvihane | 21,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font- weight:normal;\" | 3rd Congress 4 days 1981\u20131982 election |27 April \u2013 30 April 1982 | 228 | 49 FM \u2013 6 AM | Kaysone Phomvihane | 35,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font- weight:normal;\" | 4th Congress 3 days 1985\u20131986 election | 13 November \u2013 15 November 1986 | 300 | 51 FM \u2013 9 AM | Kaysone Phomvihane | 40,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font- weight:normal;\" | 5th Congress 3 days 1990\u20131991 election |27 March \u2013 29 March 1991 | 367 | 55 FM \u2013 44 AM | Kaysone Phomvihane | 60,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font- weight:normal;\" | 6th Congress 3 days 1995\u20131996 election |18 March \u2013 20 March 1996 | 381 | 49 | Khamtai Siphandon | 78,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 7th Congress 3 days 2000\u20132001 election |12 March \u2013 14 March 2001 | 452 | 53 | Khamtai Siphandon | 100,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 8th Congress 4 days 2005\u20132006 election |18 March \u2013 21 March 2006 | 498 | 55 | Khamtai Siphandon | 148,590 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 9th Congress 5 days 2010\u20132011 election | 17 March \u2013 21 March 2011 | 576 | 61 | Choummaly Sayasone | 191,700 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 10th Congress 5 days 2015\u20132016 election | 18 January \u2013 22 January 2016 | 685 | 69 \u2013 8 AM | Choummaly Sayasone | 252,879 |} == See also == * Socialist market economy * Socialist-oriented market economy ==References== ===General=== Information on congresses, number of delegates, number of people elected to CCs, party membership, the individual who presented the Political Report and information on when the congress was convened can be found in these sources: * * * * * * * * * * * ===Bibliography=== Articles and journals: * * ===Specific=== Category:Congresses of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Laos, People's Revolutionary Party ",
