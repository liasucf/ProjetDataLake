In 1941, elections were held for the Mayor of Auckland plus other local government positions including twenty-one city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. ==Background== The election saw deputy-mayor John Allum defeating the Labour nominee Joe Sayegh who suffered defeat for the third time in succession. Sayegh did not stand for the council as an inducement to vote for him as mayor, but he was elected to the Harbour Board and Hospital Board. The only successful Labour candidate for the council was Mary Dreaver, with the Citizens & Ratepayers ticket winning all other council seats. ==Mayoralty results== ==Councillor results== ==References== Category:Mayoral elections in Auckland Category:1941 elections in New Zealand Category:Politics of the Auckland Region Category:1940s in Auckland ",
