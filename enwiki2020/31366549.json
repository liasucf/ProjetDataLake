    "text": "Archiv Produktion is a classical music record label of German origin. It originated in 1949 as a classical label for the Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft (DGG), and in 1958 Archiv was established as a subsidiary of DGG, specialising in recordings of Early and Baroque music. It has since developed a particular focus on \"historically informed performance\" and the work of artists of the Early music revival movement of the 20th and 21st centuries. The first head of Archiv Produktion, serving in the position from 1948 to 1957, was Fred Hamel, a musicologist who set out the early Archiv Produktion releases according to 12 research periods, from Gregorian Chant to Mannheim and Vienna.Dorottya Fabian Bach performance practice, 1945-1975: a comprehensive review 2003 Hamel's successor 1958-1968 Hans Hickmann was a professor at the University of Hamburg who focused on Bach and Handel.Interview \"Sunken Musical Treasure\" Billboard 4 May 1968 The next director was Andreas Holschneider (1931\u20132019) from 1970-1991.
