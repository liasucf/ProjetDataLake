    "text": "Jes\u00fas Vald\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, better known as Chucho Vald\u00e9s (born October 9, 1941), is a Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger whose career spans over 50 years. An original member of the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna, in 1973 he founded the group Irakere, one of Cuba's best-known Latin jazz bands. Both his father, Bebo Vald\u00e9s, and his son, Chuchito, are pianists as well. As a solo artist, he has won four Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards. == Career == Chucho Vald\u00e9s's first recorded sessions as a leader took place in late January 1964 in the Are\u00edto Studios of Havana (former Panart studios) owned by the newly formed EGREM. These early sessions included Paquito D'Rivera on alto saxophone and clarinet, Alberto Giral on trombone, Julio Vento on flute, Carlos Emilio Morales on guitar, Kike Hern\u00e1ndez on double bass, Emilio del Monte on drums and \u00d3scar Vald\u00e9s Jr. on congas. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these would be the members of his jazz combo, whose lineup would often change, sometimes including bassists Cacha\u00edto and later Carlos del Puerto, and drummers Guillermo Barreto and later Enrique Pl\u00e1.Dalmace, Patrick.

This all-star big band would back singers such as Elena Burke and Omara Portuondo.Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna: Discography, Paquito's Records. In 1973, Chucho along with other members of the Orquesta Cubana de M\u00fasica Moderna founded Irakere, an ensemble that bridged songo and Afro-Cuban jazz. He would simultaneously continue his solo career, eventually signing with Blue Note Records, which allowed him to get international exposure. As a result, Chucho's work has received universal critical acclaim from the media, winning five Grammy awards. Chucho's father, Bebo, who attained a legendary status as the pianist and director the Tropicana Club orchestra and Orquesta Sabor de Cuba, fled Cuba in 1960, and did not record music again until the 1990s. In the late 1990s, Chucho decided to focus on his solo career, and his son Chuchito replaced him as the pianist/director of Irakere. Chucho and Bebo occasionally played together until the latter's death in 2013. Since 2010, Chucho performs with a backing band known as the Afro-Cuban Messengers. Chucho has spent much of his time teaching younger generations, either in his homeland of Cuba at the Havana National school (with many famous musicians such as Herbie Hancock), or elsewhere. == Awards and honors == Chucho has won four Grammy Awards as a solo artist: * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2001 for his album Live at the Village Vanguard * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2010 for Juntos Para Siempre, with his father Bebo Vald\u00e9s * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2011 for Chucho's Steps, with the Afro-Cuban Messengers * Best Latin Jazz Album in 2017 for Tribute to Irakere: Live in Marciac.Robinson, Circles. \"Cuba's Chucho Vald\u00e9s Wins 5th Grammy\", Havana Times, February 14, 2011.
