It protects an area of high, mountainous terrain with cerrado vegetation, important as a source of water in a region with a dry climate. ==Location== The Gr\u00e3o Mogol State Park is in the municipality of Gr\u00e3o Mogol, Minas Gerais. It has an area of . The park is mostly within the Serra Geral, in the region known as the Serra da Boca\u00edna. It contains the valley of the Bosque River and other smaller streams within the Jequitinhonha River basin. The rivers are perennial, although the climate is very dry. The terrain is mostly mountainous, with large plateaus such as the Chapada do Bosque, the Chapada do Bosquinho and the Chapada do Cardoso. ==History== The Gr\u00e3o Mogol State Park was created by decree 39.906 of 22 September 1998. Its area was redefined by decree 45.243 of 2009. It is classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park). The purpose is to protect regional fauna, flora and sources of rivers and streams in the region, to support research and scientific studies, and to provide alternatives for rational use of natural resources, such as ecological tourism. As of 2015 it was open only for scheduled educational and research visits, but was expected to soon open to the general public. ==Environment== Trees are mostly small and low, typical of high altitude fields. Forms of cerrado dominate the plateaus, particularly low cerrado with trees such as Caryocar brasiliense, Curatella americana and Qualea parviflora, and shrubby caatinga with Bromeliaceae and cactus. The valleys contain distinctive vegetation such as Vellozia squamata and isolated patches of Mauritia flexuosa. Fauna includes endangered species such as maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), macaco sau\u00e1 (a titi) and lontra. ==Attractions== The park contains a trail built by slaves in colonial times with stone paving. It links the Fazenda do Cafezal, owned by the Baron of Gr\u00e3o Mogol, to the town of Gr\u00e3o Mogol. Several sections are well preserved. Another attraction is the Curral de Pedras (Stone Corral). ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:State parks of Brazil Category:Protected areas established in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in Brazil Category:Protected areas of Minas Gerais ",
