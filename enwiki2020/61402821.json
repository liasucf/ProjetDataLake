    "text": "Judith Man (fl. 1640) was an English translator. Her 1640 Epitome of the History of Faire Argenis and Polyarchus was a translation of Nicolas Coeffeteau's 1623 Histoire de Poliarque et d'Arg\u00e9nis, itself an abridged translation of John Barclay's Latin book Argenis. ==Life== Judith Man is likely to have been a relative of Peter Man, solicitor to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. She says that she was eighteen years old at Christmas 1639, when she made her translation, and a member of the Strafford household. An English Protestant, she had travelled in France with her parents as a child. Man dedicated her translation to Wentworth's eldest daughter, Anne. Her preface justified translation as an appropriate activity for a woman, combining diversion and self-improvement. Only two extant copies of the translation survive, at the Huntington Library and the Bodleian Library. Nothing is known of her later life. ==Works== * Epitome of the History of Faire Argenis and Polyarchus, 1640 ==References== Category:English translators Category:17th-century translators Category:17th-century English women writers Category:1621 births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death unknown Category:French\u2013English translators ",
