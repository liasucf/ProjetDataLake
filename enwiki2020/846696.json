    "text": "Orl\u00e9ans (formerly Ottawa\u2014Orl\u00e9ans, Gloucester\u2014Carleton and Carleton\u2014Gloucester) is a federal electoral district in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988. The riding was created as \"Carleton\u2014Gloucester\" in 1987. Its name was changed to \"Gloucester\u2014Carleton\" in 1996, but then changed back to \"Carleton\u2013Gloucester\" in 1997. It was changed again in 2000 to \"Ottawa\u2014Orl\u00e9ans\" and to just \"Orl\u00e9ans\" in 2013. Despite having an English-speaking majority, Orl\u00e9ans is among the most francophone of the Ontario federal ridings, and a major centre of the Franco-Ontarian community. According to the 2001 Statistics Canada report, 35% of the riding population speaks French as their mother tongue. In recent years, the riding has experienced a major growth of population and increased housing projects. In the 2004 federal election, the Liberal candidate Marc Godbout won over the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson by over 4% of the votes. Robinson, a former president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, was considered a favourite but failed to win support among Francophones. Ottawa\u2014Orl\u00e9ans was also the riding where the NDP had Canada's youngest woman candidate, Crystal LeBlanc, who received 5905 votes in the 2004 federal election. ==Geography== It encompasses the suburban community of Orleans in the east end of Ottawa, Ontario (northern and eastern parts of the former city of Gloucester, Ontario plus the northwestern corner of the former city of Cumberland) as well as the neighbourhood of Blackburn Hamlet and the communities of Notre-Dame-des-Champs and Carlsbad Springs.
