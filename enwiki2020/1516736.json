The aircraft was intended to be easy to maintain, forgiving to fly, and capable of 480 km/h (300 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft). The type's sturdy construction was frequently demonstrated and the armament was effective. However, French rearmament began two full years later than that in Britain, and none of these aircraft were available in sufficient numbers to make a difference in 1940. ==Design and development== The 690 had begun life in 1934 as Br\u00e9guet's response to the same strategic fighter aircraft specification as the eventual winner, the Potez 630. Both were twin-engine monoplanes with twin tailplanes, powered by Hispano-Suiza 14AB radial engines of contemporary design and performance. Br\u00e9guet considered the weight limits of the specification \u2013 requiring a twin-engine, three-man aircraft to be lighter than 3,000 kg/6,600 lb (later 3,500 kg/7,700 lb) \u2013 to be overly restrictive and ignored them. Instead, the design was advertised as particularly versatile, with reconnaissance, ground attack and level bombing derivatives proposed that required no structural changes. Unsurprisingly, Br\u00e9guet lost out in the competition to Potez, but confident in the 690's potential, nevertheless began building a prototype on its own funds. Although it had kept informed about foreign developments with dive bombers in the early 1930s, the French Air Force did not decide to acquire modern ground-attack aircraft before 1937.Ehrengardt 2002, p. 8. Engineless for nearly a year, the 690-01 prototype finally flew on 23 March 1938,Green 1967, p. 136. and displayed such promise that 100 two-seat attack bomber versions known as the Br\u00e9guet 691 AB2 were ordered in June 1938, an order which was eventually doubled.Ehrengardt 2002, p. 10. For ground-attack, the 691's equipment included a 20 mm cannon and a pair of 7.5 mm (.295 in) machine guns firing forward, as well as an internal bomb rack that could be used in a shallow dive attack and was typically loaded with eight 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. Rear defense was provided by one flexible 7.5 mm (.295 in) machine gun, while a fixed, rearward-firing weapon of the same type was fitted under the fuselage to discourage low-flying fighters or ground fire from behind. A set of armour plates protected the crew, and the fuel tanks had rudimentary self-sealing capacity, but this protection proved insufficient in combat. ===Production=== Br\u00e9guet established an assembly line with remarkable speed: the first production aircraft flew less than a year after being ordered and was in service before the end of 1939. As with the Potez 630, the Bre 691 was beset with engine difficulties. Hispano-Suiza had decided to concentrate on its V12 liquid-cooled engines and the 14AB engine was unreliable. The French authorities decided to order a new version, the Bre 693 powered by Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M radials. Apart from the changed engines, which were of slightly smaller diameter, the two types were virtually identical. Orders for the Bre 691 were switched to the new type and more than 200 of the latter had been completed by the time of France's defeat. Late production versions of the Bre 693 introduced propulsive exhaust pipes that improved top speed by a small margin as well as, according to some sources, a pair of additional machine guns in the rear of each engine nacelle. Belgium ordered 32 licence-built copies but none were completed before the Belgian collapse. French engine makers had even greater difficulties than airframe manufacturers in keeping up with the frantic demands from 1938, and in 1939 the French government decided that all combat aircraft had to be adapted for British and US engines. Fewer than 250 Br\u00e9guet 690 series aircraft were completed. The Arm\u00e9e de l'air received only 211 examples: 75 Bre.691s, 128 Bre.693s and eight Bre.695s but the Germans captured a few dozen complete or near-complete aircraft at the factories. ==Operational history== A small experimental unit had been experimenting with ground-attack tactics since 1937, initially in outdated biplanes such as the Potez 25, then in ANF Les Mureaux 115 monoplanes. Eventually, the Arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air concluded that low-altitude level- bombing was more suitable than dive-bombing for engaging enemy vehicles and artillery over the battlefield. The chosen tactic consisted in a nap-of-the- earth approach at maximum speed, followed by a strafing run or the delivery of time-delayed bombs directly over the target. French commanders widely considered this tactic as safe for the attackers, as anti-aircraft weapons then in service would be inefficient. The French Army was not using anti- aircraft autocannons at the time (the 25 mm Hotchkiss and 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were issued only later), relying instead on rifle-calibre machine guns and slow-firing 75 mm (2.95 in) guns.Taylor and Alexander 1969, pp. 76\u201377. In late 1939, two squadrons staffed with volunteers from level bomber units were gathered in the small airfield near Vinon-sur-Verdon, where they began their operational training. As Br\u00e9guet 691s were not available yet, the crews flew the Potez 633 light bomber. When they were eventually delivered, the little Br\u00e9guet were popular with their crews, although the unreliable engines in the Bre 691 affected aircraft availability rates, and undercarriage failures proved especially troublesome. Only in March 1940 were the first combat-worthy Bre. 693s delivered, and there were now five squadrons to equip: GBA I/51, GBA II/51, GBA I/54, GBA II/54, and GBA II/35 (GBA stood for Groupe de bombardement d'assaut \u2013 assault bomber squadron), with a theoretical complement of 13 aircraft each. Because of this late delivery, crews were still working up their new machines and developing tactics when the Germans attacked. On 12 May, GBAs I/54 and II/54 performed the Br\u00e9guet's first operational sorties, against German motorized columns in the Maastricht- Tongeren-Bilsen area. German anti-aircraft fire was so devastating that only eight of the eighteen Bre.693s returned. The disastrous results of this first engagement forced the French commanders to reconsider their tactics. Until 15 May, GBA crews performed shallow dive attacks from higher altitude, which resulted in reduced losses, but the attacks had clearly been inaccurate, as the Br\u00e9guet lacked a bombsight, and they increased vulnerability to German fighters. On subsequent missions, the GBAs re-introduced low-level attacks, but with smaller formations. As the position of the French and Allied armies grew steadily more desperate, the assault groups were engaged daily, still enduring losses to anti-aircraft fire, but also increasingly to German fighters. In late June, the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air tried to evacuate its modern aircraft to North Africa, out of German reach, from where many hoped to continue the fight. However, the short-ranged Br\u00e9guets were not able to cross the Mediterranean. Unlike other modern French types, the Br\u00e9guet 690 family saw its combat career end with the Armistice. By this time, 119 aircraft had been lost, including 68 to direct enemy action, and a further 14 were written off as too heavily damaged. The five GBAs had therefore endured a mat\u00e9riel loss rate of 63%, while crew casualties were nearly 50%. After the Armistice, the Vichy authorities were allowed to maintain a small air force in mainland France, and its assault bomber pilots flew rare training flights in the Bre.693 and Bre.695. After the Germans occupied all of France in late 1942, some of the survivors were transferred to Italy for use as operational trainers. ==Variants== ;Bre 690.01: Br\u00e9guet 690 prototype. ;Bre 691.01: Br\u00e9guet 691 prototype. ;Bre 691: Two-seat twin-engine ground-attack aircraft. ;Bre 693.01: Br\u00e9guet 693 prototype. ;Bre 693: Two-seat twin-engine ground- attack aircraft. ;Bre 694.01: Prototype intended to be two or three-seat tactical reconnaissance aircraft. :;S 10: Swedish reconnaissance variant of the export Bre 694.

Only a few 695s were operationally used before the armistice. ;Bre 696.01:A two-seat light bomber prototype, which was first ordered and then cancelled in favour of the Bre 693. ;Bre 697:Intended as a pre-prototype for the Br\u00e9guet 700 C2 heavy fighter. Powered by Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-48/Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14N-49 engines which offered 50% more power than the 14M, the Bre 697 prototype displayed a sensational rate of climb, and was as fast as a Bf 109E. The Bre 700 was expected to offer even higher speed and would have been very heavily armed. ==Operators== ;:None received before surrender ;:French Air Force :Vichy French Air Force ;: Italian Air Force ;:Swedish Air Force.
