The director revealed that the film would revolve around a \"dog napping\" and would focus on the situational comedy of the incident, with his dog named Lucky playing a pivotal role. The idea for the film was based upon the widespread dog-napping which hard occurred in California during 2014. Television actor Amudhavanan was selected to play a leading role, while George Vijay, previously seen in Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) and Balaji Mohan's Maari (2015), was also picked for a lead role. ==Soundtrack== The film's music was composed by Raghu Sravan Kumar, while the audio rights of the film was acquired by Trend Music South.

The Times of India wrote \"right from the writing to the filmmaking, this film has amateurishness written all over it\" and that \"every scene is so silly, infantile and preposterous (all in a bad way) that we keep wondering how someone felt that this could be a movie\". A critic from The New Indian Express wrote \"a small budgeted film, the production values are low and this is evident throughout\" but added it is \"mildly amusing, what the film needed was a screenplay that had more punch and fizz in it\" and \"at the most, Julieum\u2026 is a promising effort by a debutant maker\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian comedy films Category:Films about dogs Category:2017 directorial debut films Category:2017 comedy films ",
