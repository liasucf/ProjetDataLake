    "text": "Pussy Cats is the tenth album by American singer Harry Nilsson, released by RCA Records in 1974. It was produced by John Lennon during his \"Lost Weekend\" period. The album title was inspired by the bad press Nilsson and Lennon were getting at the time for being drunk and rowdy in Los Angeles. They also included an inside joke on the cover \u2013 children's letter blocks \"D\" and \"S\" on either side of a rug under a table \u2212 to spell out \"drugs under the table\" as a rebus. ==Recording and development== The album was started in Los Angeles, but Lennon ultimately finished producing it in New York, where he could better control the sessions. During the recording sessions, Nilsson ruptured one of his vocal cords but chose to keep this from Lennon. He forced himself to push through the sessions, which caused even more damage, that some (including The Monkees' Micky Dolenz) say he never quite recovered from. The vocal strain is most evident on \"Old Forgotten Soldier\" and \"Loop de Loop,\" on the latter of which Nilsson's vocals are heavily masked by backing vocals. The album's intended original title, Strange Pussies, was rejected by RCA Records and modified to Pussy Cats. Among the many musicians on Pussy Cats are drummers Ringo Starr, Keith Moon and Jim Keltner, who actually all play together (on three drum kits) on the closing track, \"Rock Around the Clock\". Other contributors include Jesse Ed Davis, Klaus Voormann, and Bobby Keys. After the first night of recording, March 28, Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder popped into the studio unexpectedly.Keith Badman, The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970\u20132001, Omnibus Press (London, 2001), pp. 121\u201322. Bootleg recordings from this session were later released as the album A Toot and a Snore in '74. The incident is the last known instance of Lennon and McCartney recording together since the break-up of the Beatles. A quadrophonic version was released on record and eight-track tape. The songs were treated to special mixes for this issue of the album. Half of the album's original ten tracks were covers while the rest were written by Nilsson (with Lennon co-writing \"Mucho Mungo/Mt. Elga\"). ==Release== The album was released August 19, 1974 in the US and August 30, 1974 in the UK. Longtime Beatles publicist Derek Taylor, who produced A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, wrote the liner notes for the original Pussy Cats pressing. In it he referenced the album's notorious recording background and quipped \"Harry and John [...] have been living a vampire turntable recently but have sucked no blood except each other's and not so much of that, [...] Anyway, the cross-transfusion works, so what the hell.\" The album had a lukewarm reception, charting a peak of 60 on the US Billboard album charts. His subsequent RCA releases would chart far lower. ==Legacy== In June 1999, a commemorative 25th-anniversary edition of Pussy Cats was released. In October 2006, a track-by-track cover of the album was released by indie rock band The Walkmen. Several covers of the song \"Don't Forget Me\" have appeared, including Marshall Crenshaw's treatment on the 1995 Nilsson tribute For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson, alt-country artist Neko Case's March 2009 version on her ANTI- label release, Middle Cyclone, and Mamie Minch's contribution to 2014's tribute to Nilsson by various Indie artists This Is the Town: A Tribute to Nilsson, Vol. 1. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Harry Nilsson except where indicated. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |- |United States (Billboard 200) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|60 |} ==Personnel== *Harry Nilsson \u2013 vocals, piano (3, 5), electric piano (8, 10), clavinet (2), arrangements (3\u201310) *Jesse Ed Davis \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Danny Kortchmar \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Sneaky Pete Kleinow \u2013 pedal steel guitar (1, 2, 4, 6) *Ken Ascher \u2013 piano (1, 4, 7), electric piano (2), orchestration, conducting *Jane Getz \u2013 piano (6, 8, 10) *Willie Smith \u2013 organ (1) *Klaus Voormann \u2013 bass (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Jim Keltner \u2013 drums (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Ringo Starr \u2013 drums (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), maracas (7) *Keith Moon \u2013 drums (8, 10), congas (7), Chinese wood blocks (4) *Doug Hoefer \u2013 snare drum (2) *Cynthia Webb \u2013 maracas (7) *Bobby Keys \u2013 saxophone (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Trevor Lawrence \u2013 saxophone (2, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Jim Horn \u2013 saxophone (8, 10) *Gene Cipriano \u2013 saxophone (6) *Chuck Findley \u2013 trombone (8, 10) *The Masked Alberts Orchestra \u2013 strings (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) *Nathalie Altman, Susie Bell, Troy Germano, Erik Mueller, Rachel Mueller, Phylida Paterson, Peri Prestopino, David Steinberg, Cantey Turner, Kristin Turner, Damon Vigiano \u2013 the Masked Albert Kids Chorale (8) Production and technical personnel *John Lennon \u2013 producer, arrangements (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10) *Roy Cicala \u2013 engineer, assistant producer *Jimmy Iovine \u2013 assistant engineer *Mal Evans \u2013 production assistant *May Pang \u2013 production assistant *Dennis Ferrante \u2013 mixing *Tom Rabstenak, Greg Calbi \u2013 mastering *Cally \u2013 artwork, design, photography *Acy R.
