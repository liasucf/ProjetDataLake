    "text": "A Strange Loop is a musical with book, music and lyrics by Michael R. Jackson. The show had its world premiere Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons and ran from May 24 to July 28, 2019. The original cast recording was released on September 27, 2019 on Yellow Sound Label. The album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Cast Albums chart. The Washington, DC production at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company originally scheduled for September 2020 was postponed to mid-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Summary== The musical is about Usher, coincidentally named the same as his day-job as an usher for The Lion King on Broadway, a fat, Black, gay writer as he tries to navigate the heteronormative white world. He is backed by a six-person all-black ensemble who voice his inner thoughts as he begrudgingly ghost writes a new Tyler Perry stage play. == Cast and Characters == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Character !Off-Broadway (2019) |- !Usher | align=\"center\"| Larry Owens |- !Thought 1 | align=\"center\"| L Morgan Lee |- !Thought 2 | align=\"center\"| James Jackson, Jr. |- !Thought 3 | align=\"center\"| John-Michael Lyles |- !Thought 4 | align=\"center\"| John- Andrew Morrison |- !Thought 5 | align=\"center\"| Jason Veasey |- !Thought 6 | align=\"center\"| Antwayn Hopper |- |} ==Musical numbers== *\"Intermission Song\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"Today\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"We Wanna Know\" - Thoughts *\"Inner White Girl\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"Didn't Want Nothin'\" - Thought 5, Thoughts *\"Exile in Gayville\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"Second Wave\" - Usher *\"Tyler Perry Writes Real Life\" - Usher, Thought 3, Thoughts *\"Writing a Gospel Play\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"A Sympathetic Ear\" - Thought 1 *\"Inwood Daddy\" - Usher, Thought 6, Thoughts *\"Boundaries\" - Usher *\"Periodically\" - Thought 4, Usher *\"Didn't Want Nothin' Reprise\" - Thought 5 *\"Precious Little Dream / AIDS Is God's Punishment\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"Memory Song\" - Usher, Thoughts *\"A Strange Loop\" - Usher, Thoughts == Awards and nominations == On May 4, 2020, the Pulitzer Prize for Drama was awarded to Jackson for the musical, with the committee citing the show as \"A meta\ufb01ctional musical that tracks the creative process of an artist transforming issues of identity, race, and sexuality that once pushed him to the margins of the cultural mainstream into a meditation on universal human fears and insecurities.\" The show is the tenth musical to win the award, as well as the first musical written by a black person to win and first musical to win without a Broadway run. === Original Off-Broadway production === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" ! scope=\"col\" width=\"3%\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" width=\"23%\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" width=\"27%\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" width=\"38%\" | Nominee ! scope=\"col\" width=\"8%\" | Result |- | rowspan=\"35\" | 2020 | scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"7\" | Lucille Lortel Awards | Outstanding Musical | A Strange Loop | |- | Outstanding Director | Stephen Brackett | |- | Outstanding Choreographer | Raja Feather Kelly | |- | Outstanding Lead Actor in a Musical | Larry Owens | |- | Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical | John-Andrew Morrison | |- | Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical | L Morgan Lee | |- | Outstanding Costume Design | Montana Levi Blanco | |- | scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" | Drama Desk Awards | Outstanding Musical | A Strange Loop | |- | Outstanding Actor in a Musical | Larry Owens | |- | Outstanding Director of a Musical | Stephen Brackett | |- | Outstanding Music | rowspan=\"3\" | Michael R.
