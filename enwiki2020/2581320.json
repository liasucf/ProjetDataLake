The village is in the borough of Colchester and in the parliamentary constituency of North Essex. The town is served by Abberton and Langenhoe Parish Council. The word Abberton is derived from 'Eadburg's estate' (\u0112adburge + t\u016bn). It is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086-87 as Edburghetuna and as Edburgetuna in the Hundred of Winstree, when it was part of the lands of Count Eustace in Essex, held by Ralph de Marcy and further held by Ranulf Peverel in demesne; it was held by Siward, a free man, as a manor in the time of King Edward before the Norman conquest of 1066. It was later recorded as Eadburgetona in 1108, Adbur(u)g(h)(e)ton(e) in 1208-1321, Adburthon in 1280, also Abberton from 1230.
