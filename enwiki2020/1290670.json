    "text": "Heat is a UK entertainment magazine published by Bauer Media Group. Its mix of celebrity news, gossip, beauty advice and fashion is primarily aimed at women, although not as directly as in other women's magazines. It also features movie and music reviews, TV listings and major celebrity interviews. ==History== Heat was launched in February 1999 as a general interest entertainment magazine, at a cost of more than \u00a34m. However, unlike other Emap (now Bauer) magazine launches before and after, it was not an immediate success, with a circulation below 100,000. A series of revamps quickly repositioned the magazine as a less serious, more gossip-oriented magazine aimed at women, and circulation quickly grew. A series of high-profile celebrity relationships, such as Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt provided ample material, while reality shows such as Big Brother and Pop Idol grew popular at just the right time to help fill pages. Heat achieved record sale figures when Jade Goody had a make- over and was first on the front cover after her stint in Big Brother 3 (2002) and later when Nikki Grahame and Pete Bennett from Big Brother 7 split and Grahame was interviewed for Heat in 2006. In 2009\u201310, Heat spearheaded a campaign alongside Girls Aloud's Nicola Roberts advocating the banning of sunbed use in the UK for under-18s. The campaign was a success and a bill was passed by Parliament shortly before the 2010 General Election. The site crashed after the magazine was mentioned on Channel 4's The Million Pound Drop; it took up to eight days to restore the site. ===Editors=== * Barry McIlheney (1999\u20132000) * Mark Frith (2000\u201308) * Julian Linley (2008\u201309)\"Sam Delaney appointed Heat editor\", The Guardian, 14 September 2009, Retrieved 14 September 2009 * Sam Delaney (2009\u20132010) * Lucie Cave (2011\u20132012); Editor-in- Chief across the heat brand (2012-) * Jeremy Mark (2012\u201315) * Suzy Cox (2015-) An edition of the magazine is also published in South Africa. ==Heatworld.com== Heatworld.com launched on 22 May 2007 and was edited by Julian Linley, who had been deputy editor of Heat magazine for five years.\"Heat: Julian Linley appointed as editor\", The Guardian, 16 June 2008, Retrieved 14 September 2009 The site is an online interpretation of the magazine, emulating the mix of celebrity news, gossip and fashion.
