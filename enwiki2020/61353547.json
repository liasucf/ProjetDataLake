It is inhabited solely by Greeks. == Demographics == The village had 902 inhabitants in 1993, of which all were ethnically Greeks. The village today has a smaller permanent population of roughly 350 inhabitants, notably due to migration to Greece or other countries. Despite this, the population doubles in Easter, Summer and Christmas, as most people return to their village to celebrate or have holidays with their families. == References == == External links == *Locals of Vodrista celebrating the Dormition of the Mother of God in 15 August 2018 Category:Northern Epirus Category:Villages in Gjirokast\u00ebr County Category:Greek communities in Albania ",
