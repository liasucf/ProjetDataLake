    "text": "MorphOS is an AmigaOS-like computer operating system. It is a mixed proprietary and open source OS produced for the Pegasos PowerPC processor based computer, PowerUP accelerator equipped Amiga computers, and a series of Freescale development boards that use the Genesi firmware, including the Efika and mobileGT. Since MorphOS 2.4, Apple's Mac mini G4 is supported as well, and with the release of MorphOS 2.5 and MorphOS 2.6 the eMac and Power Mac G4 models are respectively supported. The release of MorphOS 3.2 added limited support for Power Mac G5. The core, based on the Quark microkernel, is proprietary, although several libraries and other parts are open source, such as Ambient desktop. ==Characteristics and versions== Developed for PowerPC processors from Freescale and IBM while supporting the original AmigaOS MC680x0 applications via proprietary task-based emulation, and most AmigaOS/PPC applications via API wrappers. It is API compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 and has a GUI based on MUI. Besides the Pegasos version of MorphOS, there is a version for Amiga computers equipped with PowerUP accelerator cards produced by Phase5. This version is free, although it does slow down after each two-hour session if it has not been registered. Registration is free. PowerUP MorphOS was most recently updated on 23 February 2006; however, it does not exceed the feature set or advancement of the Pegasos release. A version of MorphOS for the EFIKA, a very small mainboard based on the ultra- low-wattage MPC5200B processor from Freescale, has been shown at exhibitions and user gatherings in Germany. Current (since 2.0) release of MorphOS supports the EFIKA. ==Components== System architecture Screenshot of Ambient Desktop on MorphOS ===ABox=== ABox is an emulation sandbox featuring a PPC native AmigaOS API clone that is binary compatible with both 68k Amiga applications and both PowerUP and WarpOS formats of Amiga PPC executables. ABox is based in part on AROS Research Operating System. ABox includes Trance JIT code translator for 68k native Amiga applications. ===Other=== * AHI \u2014 audio interface: 6.7 * Ambient desktop \u2014 the default MorphOS desktop, inspired by Workbench and Directory Opus 5 * CyberGraphX \u2014 graphics interface originally developed for Amiga computers: 5.1 * Magic User Interface \u2014 primary GUI toolkit: 4.2 * Poseidon \u2014 the Amiga USB stack developed by Chris Hodges * TurboPrint \u2014 the printing system * TinyGL \u2014 OpenGL implementation and Warp3D compatibility is featured via RAVE low-level API: V 51 * Quark \u2014 manages the low level systems and hosts the A/Box currently 600px ==MorphOS software== MorphOS can run any system friendly Amiga software written for 68k processors. Also it is possible to use 68k libraries or datatypes on ppc applications and vice versa. It also provides compatibility layer for PowerUP and WarpUP software written for PowerUP accelerator cards. The largest repository is Aminet with over 75000 packages online with packages from all Amiga flavors including music, sound and artwork. MorphOS-only software repositories are hosted at MorphOS software, MorphOS files and MorphOS Storage. ===Bundled applications=== MorphOS is delivered with a number of desktop applications in the form of pre-installed software. ==Supported hardware== * Max. 1.72 GB RAM; virtual memory is not supported. * Only Radeon cards have support; Nvidia cards are not supported. ===Amiga=== * Amiga 1200 with Blizzard PPC accelerator card * Amiga 3000 with CyberStorm PPC accelerator card * Amiga 4000 with CyberStorm PPC accelerator card ===Apple=== * Mac mini G4 * eMac * Power Mac G4 * PowerBook G4 (except for 12\" aluminum models) * iBook G4 * Power Mac G5 * Power Mac G4 Cube * iMac G5 (only model A1145 - G5 2.1 20\" (iSight)) ===Genesi/bPlan GmbH=== * EFIKA 5200B * Pegasos I G3 * Pegasos II G3/G4 ===ACube=== * ACube company and their Sam460 series mainboards ===A-Eon Technology=== * X5000 mainboard ==History== Amiga family development tree The project started in 1999, based on the Quark microkernel. The earliest versions of MorphOS ran only via PPC accelerator cards on the Amiga computers, and required portions of AmigaOS to fully function. A collaborative effort between the companies bPlan (of which the lead MorphOS developer is a partner) and Thendic-France in 2002 resulted in the first regular, non-prototype production of bPlan-engineered Pegasos computers capable of running MorphOS or Linux. Thendic-France had financial problems and folded; however, the collaboration continued under the new banner of \"Genesi\". A busy promotional year followed in 2003, with appearances at conventions and exhibitions in several places around the world, including CES in Las Vegas. After some bitter disagreements within the MorphOS development team in 2003 and 2004, culminating with accusations by a MorphOS developer that he and others had not been paid, the Ambient desktop interface was released under GPL and is now actively developed by the Ambient development team. Subject to GPL rules, Ambient continues to be included in the commercial MorphOS product. An alternative MorphOS desktop system is Scalos. On April 1, 2008, the MorphOS team announced that MorphOS 2.0 would be released within Q2/2008. This promise was only kept by a few seconds, with the release of MorphOS 2.0 occurring on June 30, 2008 23:59 CET. MorphOS 3.11 is commercially available at a price of \u20ac79 per machine (\u20ac49 for the Efika PPC or Sam460 boards). A fully functional demo of MorphOS is available, but without a keyfile, its speed is decreased significantly after 30 minutes of use per session; rebooting the system allows for another 30 minutes of use. ===Release history of 0.x/1.x series=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !|Version !|Release date !|Notes |- ||0.1 ||August 1, 2000 ||Amiga |- ||0.2 ||October 17, 2000 ||Amiga |- ||0.4 ||February 14, 2001 ||3rd Release Alt URL |- ||0.5 ||May 1, 2001 ||Amiga |- ||0.8 ||August 2001 ||Amiga, Pegasos I |- ||0.9 ||2002 ||betaMorphOS 0.9 video |- ||1.0 ||14 October 2002 ||Pegasos I |- ||1.1 ||December 13, 2002 ||Pegasos I |- ||1.2 ||February 9, 2003 ||Pegasos I |- ||1.3 ||March 27, 2003 ||Pegasos I |- ||1.4 ||August 7, 2003 ||Pegasos I |- ||1.4.4 ||March 28, 2005 ||Pegasos I/II |- ||1.4.5 ||April 30, 2005 ||Pegasos I/II |- ||1.4.5 ||August 25, 2005 ||Amiga |} ===Release history of 2.x/3.x series=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !|Version !|Release date !|Notes |- ||2.0 ||June 30, 2008 ||Added support for Efika 5200B platform; native TCP/IP stack, an updated Sputnik release, AltiVec support, alpha compositing 3D layers for the graphical user interface, new USB components (including USB 2.0 support), new screenblankers, and Reggae, a new, modular, streaming multimedia frameworkMorphOS 2.0 release notes |- ||2.1 ||September 6, 2008 ||Support for the EFIKA's audioMorphOS 2.1 release notes |- ||2.2 ||December 20, 2008 ||TrueCrypt-compatible disk encryption suiteMorphOS 2.2 release notes |- ||2.3 ||August 6, 2009 ||Origyn Web Browser as the default browser, read only HFS+ filesystem supportMorphOS 2.3 release notes |- ||2.4 ||October 12, 2009 ||Added support for Mac mini G4; Write support for Mac HFS disks, new charsets.library to provide better multilingual application supportMorphOS 2.4 release notes |- ||2.5 ||June 4, 2010 ||Added support for eMac G4; drivers for SiI3x1x based 2-port Serial ATA PCI cardsMorphOS 2.5 release notes |- ||2.6 ||October 10, 2010 ||Added support for Power Mac G4; 2D drivers for Rage 128 Pro graphics cards; Released at precisely 10.10.10 10:10MorphOS 2.6 release notes |- ||2.7 ||December 2, 2010 ||Improving support for Power Mac G4 platformsMorphOS 2.7 release notes |- ||3.0 ||June 8, 2012 ||Added support for PowerBook G4; performance improvementsMorphOS 3.0 release notes |- ||3.1 ||July 8, 2012 ||Bug-fix releaseMorphOS 3.1 release notes |- ||3.2 ||May 27, 2013 ||Added support for further PowerBook G4 models, iBook G4 and Power Mac G5 model A1047; 3D drivers for Radeon R300 based cards, wireless networking via Atheros chipset, major overhaul of TCP/IP stack (\"NetStack\") - improving networking performanceMorphOS 3.2 release notes |- ||3.3 ||September 18, 2013 ||Fixes support for some iBook G4 modelsMorphOS 3.3 release notes |- ||3.4 ||December 14, 2013 ||Improved R300 3D and G5 video playback performance, support for non-native display resolutions on various PowerBook modelsMorphOS 3.4 release notes |- ||3.5 ||February 15, 2014 ||Support for PowerMac7,2 Power Mac G5 modelsMorphOS 3.5 release notes |- ||3.6 ||June 27, 2014 ||Broadcom Wi- Fi support, AMD R400 support, SMBFS filesystem, VNC server and a Synergy clientMorphOS 3.6 release notes |- ||3.7 ||August 3, 2014 ||Bug-fix releaseMorphOS 3.7 release notes |- ||3.8 ||May 15, 2015 ||Support for Sam 460 series of mainboards; basic drivers for Radeon HD series graphics cards, support for 4K displays in their native resolutionMorphOS 3.8 release notes |- ||3.9 ||June 19, 2015 ||Bug-fix releaseMorphOS 3.9 release notes |- ||3.10 ||March 25, 2018 ||Extended hardware support (X5000 mainboard; new SATA controllers, network controllers, scanners and graphics cards), Flow Studio IDE with built-in debugger, support for time zones, new fonts, new themes, support for vector graphics, including SVG icons, overall bug fixes and performance improvementsMorphOS 3.10 release notes |- ||3.11 ||July 6, 2018 ||Bug-fix releaseMorphOS 3.11 release notes |- ||3.12 ||October 2, 2019 ||Dual monitor support for select hardware, improved thermal management for select hardware, new FireWire stack, support for more printers and scanners, upgraded Odyssey browsers with HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3 and spell checking support, substantial upgrades and new features to Flow Studio IDE, UTF-8 support in MUI, ObjFW runtime with Automatic Reference CountingMorphOS 3.12 release notes |- ||3.13 ||February 7, 2020 ||Bug-fix releaseMorphOS 3.13 release notes |- ||3.14 ||October 4, 2020 ||Kernel improvements for threading, improved TCP/IP network stack threading support, improved unix emulation layer, Magic User Interface improvements, improved ObjectiveC framework, improved translations for various languages, updated open source components for various libraries and classes, numerous bug fixes.
