    "text": "The Gibraltar pound (currency sign: \u00a3; banking code: GIP) is the currency of Gibraltar. It is pegged to \u2013 and exchangeable with \u2013 the British pound sterling at par value. Coins and banknotes of the Gibraltar pound are minted or printed by the Government of Gibraltar. ==History== Until 1872, the currency situation in Gibraltar was complicated, with a system based on the real being employed which encompassed British, Spanish and Gibraltarian coins. From 1825, the real (actually the Spanish real de plata) was tied to the pound at the rate of 1 Spanish dollar to 4 shillings 4 pence (equivalent to 21.67 pence today). In 1872, however, the Spanish currency became the sole legal tender in Gibraltar. In 1898, the Spanish\u2013American War made the Spanish peseta drop alarmingly and the pound was introduced as the sole currency of Gibraltar, initially in the form of British coins and banknotes. In 1898, the British pound was made sole legal tender, although the Spanish peseta continued in circulation until the Spanish Civil War. Since 1927, Gibraltar has issued its own banknotes and, since 1988, its own coins. Gibraltar decimalised in 1971 at the same time as the UK, replacing the system of 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence with one of 1 pound = 100 (new) pence. ==Relationship with the British pound== The since repealed Currency Notes Act 1934, conferred on the Government of Gibraltar the right to print its own notes. Notes issued are either backed by Bank of England notes at a rate of one to one, or can be backed by securities issued by the Government of Gibraltar. Although Gibraltar notes are denominated in \"pounds sterling\", they are not legal tender anywhere in the United Kingdom. Gibraltar's coins are the same weight, size and metal as British coins, although the designs are different, and they are occasionally found in circulation across Britain. Under the Currency Notes Act 2011 the notes and coins issued by the Government of Gibraltar are legal tender and current coin within Gibraltar. British coins and Bank of England notes also circulate in Gibraltar and are universally accepted and interchangeable with Gibraltarian issues. ==Coins== In 1988, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pence and 1 pound were introduced which bore specific designs for and the name of Gibraltar. They were the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding British coins, with 2 pound coins introduced in 1999. A new coin of 5 pounds was issued in 2010 with the inscription \"Elizabeth II \u00b7 Queen of Gibraltar\".'Queen of Gibraltar' in new coin, Panorama, 7 May 2010 This issue caused controversy in Spain, where the title of King of Gibraltar historically corresponds to the crown of Castile.Pol\u00e9mica en \u00e1mbitos diplom\u00e1ticos por la asistencia de la reina do\u00f1a Sof\u00eda a los actos de homenaje a Isabel II: consideran que puede perjudicar los intereses soberanos espa\u00f1oles, El Confidencial Digital, 6 May 2012 {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Depiction of Gibraltar coinage | Reverse side |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.01 ! \u00a30.02 ! \u00a30.05 |- | 100px | File:Two pence coin (Gibraltar).jpg | File:Five pence coin (Gibraltar).jpg |- | Barbary partridge | Europa Point Lighthouse | Barbary macaque and Gibraltar candytuft |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.10 ! \u00a30.20 ! \u00a30.50 |- | File:Ten pence coin (Gibraltar).jpg | File:Twenty Pence coin (Gibraltar).jpg | File:Fifty pence coin (Gibraltar).jpg |- | Europort | Our Lady of Europe | Bottlenose dolphins |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a31.00 ! \u00a32.00 ! |- |100px |120px | |- | Fortress and Key | Pillars of Hercules | |} The \u00a32 coin has featured a new design every year since its introduction, as it depicts each of the 12 Labours of Hercules. ===Tercentenary edition=== In 2004 the Government of Gibraltar minted a new edition of its coins to commemorate the tercentenary of British Gibraltar (1704-2004). {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.01 ! \u00a30.02 ! \u00a30.05 |- | 90px | 120px | 80px |- | Barbary macaque | Keys of Gibraltar | Constitution Order (1969) |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.10 ! \u00a30.20 ! \u00a30.50 |- | 100px | 90px | 120px |- | Operation Torch (1942) | Discovery of Neanderthal skull in Gibraltar (1848) | Battle of Trafalgar (1805) |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a31.00 ! \u00a32.00 ! |- | 100px | 120px | |- | Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-1783) | Capture of Gibraltar (1704) | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Third series of Gibraltar coinage | Reverse side |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.01 ! \u00a30.02 ! \u00a30.05 |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | Constitution Order (1969) | Operation Torch (1942) | Barbary ape |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.10 ! \u00a30.20 ! \u00a30.50 |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | The Great Siege (1779-1783) | The Keys of Gibraltar | Our Lady of Europe |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a31.00 ! \u00a32.00 ! \u00a35.00 |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | Discovery of the Neanderthal Skull in Gibraltar (1848) | Battle of Trafalgar (1805) | Rock of Gibraltar |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Fourth series of Gibraltar coinage | Reverse side |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.01 ! \u00a30.02 ! \u00a30.05 |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a30.10 ! \u00a30.20 ! \u00a30.50 |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" (1779-1783) | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! \u00a31.00 ! |- | File:Blank.png | File:Blank.png |- | Coat of arms of Gibraltar with inscription \"Fiftieth Anniversary of the Referendum\" (1848) | | |} ==Banknotes== At the outbreak of World War I, Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold. These notes were issued under emergency wartime legislation, Ordinance 10 of 1914. At first the typeset notes were signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood, though he later used stamps. The notes bore the embossed stamp of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes. The 1914 notes were issued in denominations of 2/-, 10/-, \u00a31, \u00a35 and \u00a350. The 2/- and \u00a350 notes were not continued when a new series of notes was introduced in 1927. The 10/- note was replaced by the 50p coin during the process of decimalization. In 1975, \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes were introduced, followed by \u00a350 in 1986. The \u00a31 note was discontinued in 1988. In 1995, a new series of notes was introduced which, for the first time, bore the words \"pounds sterling\" rather than just \"pounds\". The government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes beginning with the \u00a310 and \u00a350 notes issued on July 8, 2010. On May 11, 2011, the \u00a35, \u00a320 and \u00a3100 notes were issued. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" |- !colspan=7|Circulating banknotes 2010-2011 Issue |- !colspan=2|Image !! rowspan=\"2\"|Denomination !! rowspan=\"2\"|Dimensions !! rowspan=\"2\"|Dominant colour !!colspan=\"2\"| Description |- !Obverse !!
