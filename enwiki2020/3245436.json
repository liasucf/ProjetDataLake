According to traditional accounts, Ali was the only person born inside the Kaaba in the city of Mecca. ==Event== The tradition states that Ali's mother was at the wall of the Kaaba when it miraculously parted, and she entered, to emerge three days later holding the infant Ali in her arms. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy wrote in his book Min Fada-il al-\u2018Ashrat al- Mubashireen bil Janna, \"May God have mercy upon Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was born in the Kaaba.\" Nurul Absar, a 19th-century book by Mu'min bin Hasan al- Shablanji al-Shafi'i, also affirms that Ali was born in the Kaaba. ==Accounts== Many narrators support the fact that Ali was born inside the Kaaba. These include: * Al-Masudi in Murooj-udh-Dhahab (Volume II) * Muhammad ibn Talha el-Shafei in Matalib-us-saool * El-Umari in Sharh Ainia * Halabi in Sira (Volume I) * Sibt ibn al-Jauzi in Tadhkera Khawasil Ummah * Ibn Sabbagh Maleki in Fusoolul Mohimma * Muhammad bin Yousuf Shafei in Kifayet al-Talib * Mu'min bin Hasan al-Shablanji al-Shafi'i in Nurul Absar * Ibn Zahra in Ghiyathul Ikhtisar * Edvi in Nafhatul Qudsia * Abbas al-Aqqad in Al-'Abqarriyet al-Imam Ali * Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy in Min Fada-il al-\u2018Ashrat al-Mubashireen bil Janna ==References== Category:Ali Ali ibn Abi Talib ",
