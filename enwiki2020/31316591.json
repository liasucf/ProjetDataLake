Pennington-Richards and starring Robert Beatty, Michael Medwin and Virginia McKenna. The screenplay concerns a journalist who goes on holiday to Ireland where he encounters a fortune- teller. ==Production== It was based on a radio play To Tell You the Truth by Robert Barr. It was shot at Southall Studios on a budget of \u00a343,000.Chibnall & McFarlane p.116 ==Plot== Timothy Blake (Michael Medwin), a British reporter holidaying on a remote island offshore of Ireland, hears a man's voice coming from the bottom of a well. The voice turns out to be a modern-day Oracle, or fortune teller, whose predictions prove uncannily accurate. Bob is determined to get a story out of this, but his editor is less enthusiastic and promptly fires him. The newfound publicity though, means the once-sleepy Irish village is now invaded by curiosity seekers, and those seeking the horse racing results. ==Cast== * Robert Beatty as Bob Jefferson * Michael Medwin as Timothy Blake * Virginia McKenna as Shelagh * Mervyn Johns as Tom Mitchum * Arthur Macrae as Alan Digby * Gillian Lind as Jane Bond * Ursula Howells as Peggy * Louise Hampton as Miss Turner * John Charlesworth as Denis * Joseph Tomelty as Terry Roche * Lockwood West as Adams * Maire O'Neill as Mrs Lenham * John McBride as Mick * Derek Tansley as Idiot Boy * Patrick McAlinney as O'Keefe * Lionel Marson as Announcer * Jean St. Clair as Young Girl * Jack May as Old Man * Gilbert Harding as Voice of the Oracle ==Critical reception== Allmovie called it \"A lesser comedy of the Ealing school (though not from the Ealing studios)\"; the Radio Times called it a \"piffling comedy in which whimsy is heaped on to make up for the absence of genuine humour\"; but Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings thought more highly of the piece, whilst acknowledging \"This is no classic, but it\u2019s pleasant and has a little meat on its bones,\" and concluding the film was \"Worth a look.\" ==References== ==Bibliography== * Chibnall, Steve & McFarlane, Brian.
