    "text": "Describing the Baptist view on homosexuality is difficult due to the multitude of Baptist organizations, each with a slightly different doctrinal statement. The issue is further compounded by the large number of autonomous Independent Baptist churches which are not part of an organization and have their own doctrinal statements and beliefs. ==Basic beliefs== As with most issues, there is a diversity of views of members of Baptist churches on homosexuality. Some denominations remain more conservative, believing in what they describe as 'traditional' marriage between one man and one woman. Other more liberal denominations allow local and autonomous congregations to determine their own regional policies. Thus, denominations are generally divided on the issue and reflect a diversity of opinions. Nevertheless, Baptists generally believe that homosexuality must be an issue that is approached with compassion and love. Dr. Albert Mohler, President of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, emphasizes that: \"Our response to persons involved in homosexuality must be marked by genuine compassion. But a central task of genuine compassion is telling the truth, and the Bible reveals a true message we must convey. Those seeking to contort and subvert the Bible\u2019s message are not responding to homosexuals with compassion. To lie is never compassionate \u2014 and their lie leads unto death.\" A relatively small, albeit growing, number of Baptists and congregations are open to the acceptance of homosexual relationships.Network of Baptists affirming Lesbian & Gay Christians This openness may, however, be based on sustaining a beneficial relationship than a change in the teachings of the Holy Bible. Al Sharpton, a Baptist minister and Civil rights leader, during his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 said that asking whether gays or lesbians should be able to get married was insulting: \"That's like saying you give blacks, or whites, or Latinos the right to shack up \u2013 but not get married [...] It's like asking 'do I support black marriage or white marriage'. . . . The inference of the question is that gays are not like other human beings\".Sharpton Chides Black Churches Over Homophobia, Gay Marriage , Dyana Bagby, Houston Voice, January 24, 2006 ==Positions of churches== Several organizations and denominations of Baptist churches have issued statements and resolutions about homosexuality. ===Conservative position=== * The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Baptist denomination globally with 15 million members (mainly in the United States), has issued several resolutions in which it rejects homosexuality as a lifestyle and refers to it as a \"manifestation of a depraved nature\", \"a perversion of divine standards and as a violation of nature and natural affections\" and \"an abomination in the eyes of God.\"Resolution On Homosexuality June 1988 on sbc.net It opposes same-sex marriages and equivalent unions.On Same-Sex Marriage June 2003 on sbc.net The Convention has urged churches not to show any approval of homosexuality.Resolution On Homosexuality June 1976 on sbc.net The Convention however also holds that \"while the Bible condemns such practice as sin, it also teaches forgiveness and transformation, upon repentance, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"Resolution On Homosexuality June 1985 on sbc.net] * The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., the second largest Baptist church globally and predominantly African- American, released an official position statement in 2012 that defines marriage as the exclusive union of a man and a woman.A Statement on the Same- sex Marriage Issue, Voting and Christian Responsibility National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.

The ABCUSA \"allows individual congregations to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy or perform same-sex marriages\" and does not have a denomination-wide policy. * The Progressive National Baptist Convention, a mainline predominantly African American denomination, does not have an official position and, like many Baptist denominations, allows individual congregations to determine their own view. As a result, some congregations have performed blessings and marriages for same- sex couples. * The Baptist Union of Great Britain with 140,000 individuals holds a nuanced view.
