    "text": "Algeria\u2013European Union relations are the foreign relations between the country of Algeria and the European Union.Although there has been a large degree of integration between European Union member states, foreign relations is still a largely intergovernmental matter, with the 27 members controlling their own relations to a large degree. However, with the Union holding more weight as a single bloc, there are at times attempts to speak with one voice, notably on trade and energy matters. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy personifies this role. ==Trade== Algeria has been in an association agreement and a free trade agreement with the European Union since 2005.
