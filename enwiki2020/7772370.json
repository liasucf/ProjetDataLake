After Tuesday's test session, Schumacher said that he felt at home with Scuderia Ferrari and relished his first drive. \u201cI really enjoyed today,\" he said. \"It felt like home in the garage from the very first moment with a lot of people that have known me since I was very young. The SF90 is incredible because of the power it has but it is also smooth to drive and that's why I enjoyed myself so much.\" Schumacher added he was impressed by the braking power of a modern F1 car. \"It seemed to me you could brake later and later and the car would have made the turn anyway. I would like to say thank you Ferrari for this incredible opportunity.\" Schumacher was to continue in-season testing for Alfa Romeo Racing the following day. Schumacher was due to make his Formula One debut at the 2020 Eifel Grand Prix in the first practice session, driving for Alfa Romeo Racing in place of Antonio Giovinazzi.
