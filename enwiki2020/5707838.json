The GSAM is situated on the border of the jungle and has been registered and running since 1948. Banbasa is a popular spot for people to cross into Nepal from India as there is an immigration office for both countries.

Vehicles can also cross the border into Nepal/India but specific times are held when this can happen (3-4 times per day). == Transport == Buses run direct between Banbasa and Delhi, Agra, Bareilly, Rudrapur, Nanital, Haldwani, Dehradun, Haridwar, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Shimla and many other places.
