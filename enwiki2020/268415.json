    "text": "Milk & Kisses is the eighth and final studio album by Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins, issued by Fontana Records in March 1996. It proved to be their last; a meeting two years later to record a new album ended with the breakup of the band. The song \"Rilkean Heart\" was an homage to Jeff Buckley, who was a lifelong lover of the work of poet Rainer Maria Rilke. The Japanese edition of Milk & Kisses contained two bonus tracks (\"Flock Of Soul\" and \"Primitive Heart\"). The Hong Kong edition contained a duet version of \"Serpentskirt\" sung by Elizabeth Fraser with C-pop artist Faye Wong. Wong later recorded an acoustic version of \"Rilkean Heart\" for her 1997 album Faye Wong, on which Guthrie and Raymonde also wrote a new song, \"Yu Le Chang\" (\"Amusement Park\"), for her. In 2013, Sarah Brightman covered their song \"Eperdu\" on her album Dreamchaser. ==Track listing== All songs written by Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde. #\"Violaine\" \u2013 3:45 #\"Serpentskirt\" \u2013 3:57 #\"Tishbite\" \u2013 3:50 #\"Half-Gifts\" \u2013 4:18 #\"Calfskin Smack\" \u2013 4:58 #\"Rilkean Heart\" \u2013 4:02 #\"Ups\" \u2013 3:34 #\"Eperdu\" \u2013 4:38 #\"Treasure Hiding\" \u2013 4:55 #\"Seekers Who Are Lovers\" \u2013 4:45 ==Personnel== * Production \u2013 Cocteau Twins * Engineering \u2013 Cocteau Twins, Des Ward, Lincoln Fong, and Mitsuo Tate * Photography \u2013 Spiros Politis ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1996) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA Charts) | 64 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) | 48 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canadian Album Charts (RPM) | 53 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums Chart (OCC) | 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Billboard 200 |99 |} == References == Category:Cocteau Twins albums Category:1996 albums Category:Faye Wong Category:Fontana Records albums ",
