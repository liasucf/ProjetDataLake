    "text": "Mahdah (, or Wil\u0101yat Ma\u1e25\u1e0dah (), is an Omani territory north of the town of Al- Buraimi which borders the emirates of Sharjah, Ajman and Dubai. It was previously necessary to pass through Mahdah to reach the Ajman exclave of Masfut, as well as the Dubai exclave of Hatta, a popular tourist spot for its hotel, government-run Heritage Village and the famous (although now a metalled road) Hatta track. However, a road linking Hatta to the Mleiha road now means Mahdah can be bypassed. It contains the township of Rawdah and is governed from Buraimi. It was traditionally home to the Bani Kaab tribe. Previously a 'soft' border, the road through Mahdah now has formal entry and exit points, open only to GCC nationals. Crossing the Omani border at Mahdah represents an exit from/entry to the UAE. The trip to the Omani border at Hatta is a popular one for expatriates from qualifying countries performing a 'visa run' in order to renew their visit visas to the UAE. A visit visa is valid for one month, renewable at a police station up to three months but then requires an exit from the country. As a number of, mainly Western, nationalities acquire a 'visa on entry', a trip to the Hatta border post and then back results in the renewal of an expired three-month visit visa. This trip has been rendered a great deal less popular since Dubai, and the UAE in general, has reformed its immigration practices and streamlined residence visa issuance and renewal. It is claimed the first Arab Ambassador to America, Ahmed Bin Na\u2019man Al Kaabi, came from Mahdah in 1840. == See also == * Al-Buraimi * Al Qabil * Hamasah * Sunaynah == References == Category:Oman\u2013United Arab Emirates border crossings Category:Populated places in Al Buraimi Governorate ",
