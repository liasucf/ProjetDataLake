    "text": "Wendla \u00c5berg (1791-1864), was a Swedish stage actress and ballet dancer. She was a star attraction of the Gothenburg theatre and one of the most celebrated stage actors outside of the provincial theatre in her time. Wendla \u00c5berg was the daughter of the opera singer Inga \u00c5berg and the nobleman Carl Gustaf von Stockenstr\u00f6m. She was engaged at the Comediehuset in Gothenburg in 1812-16, and then at its successor stage of Segerlindska teatern in 1816-23; first under Johan Anton Lindqvist and (from 1820) under Gustaf \u00c5bergsson. She was a star attraction of the theatre during the period in which Gothenburg had a permanent theatre, the only one outside of Stockholm. \u00c5berg was not only a stage actor, but also a trained dancer. As such she provided dance when ballet was offered by the theatre, and highly respected for this art. She was equally popular as an actor, and considered to be one of the three most distinguished women of the Swedeish provincial theatre of her time: In 1823, the Gothenburg Theatre was dissolved as a permanent stage and \u00c5berg was engaged at the theatre company of Carl Wildner. Wendla \u00c5berg discontinued her stage career in 1825, and settled in Gothenburg with her mother, where she became a dance instructor. She was very successful in this regard and became a famous local profile of her time: for forty years, she instructed the high society debutants of Gothenburg prior to their social debut ball. == References == Category:1791 births Category:1864 deaths Category:19th-century Swedish actresses Category:Swedish stage actresses Category:19th-century Swedish ballet dancers Category:19th-century Swedish educators Category:Dance teachers ",
