    "text": "Herceg Novi (; ) is a coastal town in Montenegro located at the entrance to the Bay of Kotor and at the foot of Mount Orjen. It is the administrative center of the Herceg Novi Municipality with around 33,000 inhabitants. Herceg Novi was known as Castelnuovo (\"New castle\" in Italian) between 1482 and 1797, when it was part of Ottoman Empire and the Albania Veneta of the Republic of Venice. It was a Catholic bishopric and remains a Latin titular see as Novi. Herceg Novi has had a turbulent past, despite being one of the youngest settlements on the Adriatic. A history of varied occupations has created a blend of diverse and picturesque architectural style in the city.Monuments == Names == In Montenegrin, the town is known as Herceg Novi or \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438; in Italian as Castelnuovo; and in Greek as Ne\u00f2kastron (\u039d\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd), all meaning 'new castle'. == History == Archeological findings from Lu\u0161tica peninsula and Vranjaj cavern imply that the area was populated in Neolithic and early Bronze Age. In 3rd century BC, after beating the Illyrians, the area was ruled by Roman Republic. After the split of the Roman Empire, the area fell under rule of Western Roman Empire. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the area was dominated by Byzantine Empire. Slavic tribes began inhabiting these lands in 7th century AD. During these times the small settlement was part of Byzantine-held Dra\u010devica district, which in turn later belonged to Principality of Travunija. In 10th century Dra\u010devica comes under the control of various Dioclean/Zetan dukes, who were in turn incorporated into Kingdom of Serbia ruled by the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. After the death of Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, Serbian Empire begins to fracture into smaller principalities and districts, Dra\u010devica being administered by great duke Vojislav Vojinovi\u0107. After the rulership of Vojinovi\u0107, the area, along with most of modern Montenegro, comes under the rule of Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family. The medieval town was founded on a small fishing village as a fortress in 1382 by the first King of Bosnia, Stefan Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107 and was originally named Sveti Stefan (Saint Stephen). left The Fortress of 'Stari Grad' (Old Town) After the death of Tvrtko, Duke Sandalj Hrani\u0107 of the Herzegovinian Kosa\u010das acquired Sveti Stefan. During his reign, the town picked up trading salt. When Hrani\u0107 died, his nephew, Herzog Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da inherited it. During the reign of Duchy of Saint Sava, the town grew in importance and became Stjepan's seat, getting a new name in the process: Herceg Novi. Herzog Stjepan also founded Savina monastery. The Turks conquered Herceg Novi in 1482, and ruled for 200 years, until 1687. They built Kanli Tower on the upper edge of the city. However, there was a short pause between 1538 and 1539 when it was held by the Spaniards before they were defeated in the Siege of Castelnuovo. In their brief overlordship, the Spanish built a Hispaniola fort above the city that is well-preserved today.

In Venice, the city was known as Castelnuovo. The Venetians refortified the old town walls and towers and reinforced the fortress with a Citadella tower (destroyed in an earthquake in 1979). On 24 August 1798, Herceg Novi was annexed by Habsburg Austria but was then ceded to Russia as per the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December 1805. The Russians officially occupied Herceg Novi between 28 February 1806 and 12 August 1807. On 7 July 1807, Herceg Novi was ceded to Napoleon I Bonaparte's French Empire as per the Treaty of Tilsit. Official French rule over Herceg Novi began on 12 August 1807, when the Russians left the city. The city was part of Dalmatia until 14 October 1809, when it was annexed to the newly created Illyrian Provinces. left Herceg Novi, as well as the rest of the Bay of Kotor, was overtaken by Montenegrin forces in 1813. It was under control of a temporary government based in Dobrota between 11 September 1813 and 10 June 1814, which was supported by Montenegro. The appearance of Austrian forces in 1814 caused the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro to turn over the territory to Austrian administration on 11 June. After Herceg Novi was retaken, as well as the rest of the bay, it became part of the Dalmatian crownland. The bay was under Austro-Hungarian control until 1918.

On 7 November 1918, the Serbian Army entered the bay and were greeted by the people as Slavic liberators. The bay later became a part of the self-proclaimed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Within a month, this region united with Serbia as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The bay was a municipality of Dalmatia until it was, like all historic entities, abolished in 1922. It was incorporated into the Zeta Oblast (province), from 1929 style Zeta Banate. Herceg Novi was annexed by Mussolini's fascist Italy during World War II in 1941. It became a part of the province of Cattaro. Herceg Novi was later retaken by Yugoslav Partisan forces on 10 September 1943. Within Tito's Communist reformed Yugoslavia, Herceg Novi became part of the People's Republic of Montenegro. It would follow its fate at the dismemberment of Yugoslavia into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and as that fell apart in 2006 into independent Montenegro. == Ecclesiastical history == Church Sv.

It is well known as a spa and health center; nearby Igalo has an abundance of healing sea mud called \"igaljsko blato\" (Igalo mud) and mineral water springs called \"igaljske slatine\" (Igalo water springs). The most famous tourist attractions in Herceg Novi are castle Forte Mare built by the Bosnian king Tvrtko I in 1382, a clock tower built by Austrians in the 19th century, the Kanli tower built by Turks.

Tourist companies organise one-day boat trips to Lu\u0161tica peninsula, which lies opposite to the town. Popular Lu\u0161tica peninsula beach sites include \u017danjic, Miri\u0161te and Rose. Herceg Novi accounted for one-third of overnight stays in Montenegro before the Yugoslav wars, but the situation has changed since in favour of Budva, Kotor and other resorts in the northern part of the coast. Zelenika which is also a small city in Herceg Novi is also a very popular place to visit along the shores of Montenegro. == Culture == A walkway in Herceg Novi \"JUK Herceg-Fest\" This cultural events center was established on 24 February 1992. Two years later the cultural center joined with the \"Orijen\" movie distribution and production company. Together they have played a crucial role in enhancing the city's cultural life.

The Herceg Novi City Archive was returned in 1956 the Archive to Herceg Novi after being temporarily relocated to Zadar, Croatia. The Archive was relocated to Zadar by Italians during the Second World War. The original archive building, built in 1885, suffered severe damage from the 1979 earthquake. Shortly afterward, the building was renovated. Today, the Archive is in size. The Archive features modern equipment and a library open to the public. The oldest document in the Archive originated in 1685. The library contains approximately 30,000 volumes and 1,000 periodicals. The Historical Museum was established in 1949 and officially opened in 1953.

Herceg Novi or Igalo is usually the final destination of buses that come from inland Montenegro and Serbia. The Adriatic Motorway, a two-lane motorway that extends for the length of the Montenegrin coast, goes through Herceg Novi before it merges with the Croatian road network at the Debeli Brijeg border crossing. The ferry operates on the Kamenari \u2013 Lepetane line at Verige Strait, eliminating the need to go all the way around Boka Kotorska bay in order to reach Tivat, Kotor, Budva and inland Montenegro. Tivat Airport is away (via the ferry). There are regular flights to Belgrade and Z\u00fcrich, and dozens of charter planes land daily on Tivat airport during the summer season. Dubrovnik Airport in Croatia is some away, and it maintains regular flights to many European destinations. == Climate == A pomegranate tree near the bus station in Herceg Novi. September 2018. The area of the Bay of Kotor has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with significantly more rain in the winter than in the summer. Herceg Novi has a specific microclimate, which is a result of southern exposition, proximity to the sea, limestone substratum and mountainous hinterland which prevents the breakthrough of cold air masses. Herceg Novi has approximately 200 sunny days a year. In July and August there are approximately 11 sunny hours per day. Average annual temperature is (similar to that of Naples and Lisbon). There are frequent slight temperature oscillations; the average daily temperature fluctuation is only 4 \u00b0C (7.2 \u00b0F).
