    "text": "__NOTOC__ The Conscience of a Hacker (also known as The Hacker Manifesto) is a small essay written January 8, 1986 by a computer security hacker who went by the handle (or pseudonym) of The Mentor (born Loyd Blankenship), who belonged to the 2nd generation of hacker group Legion of Doom. It was written after the author's arrest, and first published in the underground hacker ezine Phrack and can be found on many websites, as well as on T-shirts and in films. Considered a cornerstone of hacker culture, the Manifesto acts as a guideline to hackers across the globe, especially those new to the field. It serves as an ethical foundation for hacking, and asserts that there is a point to hacking that supersedes selfish desires to exploit or harm other people, and that technology should be used to expand our horizons and try to keep the world free. When asked about his motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, > I was going through hacking withdrawal, and Craig/Knight Lightning needed > something for an upcoming issue of Phrack. I was reading The Moon is a Harsh > Mistress and was very taken with the idea of revolution. At a more prominent public event, when asked about his arrest and motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, > I was just in a computer I shouldn\u2019t have been. And [had] a great deal of > empathy for my friends around the nation that were also in the same > situation. This was post-WarGames, the movie, so pretty much the only public > perception of hackers at that time was \u2018hey, we\u2019re going to start a nuclear > war, or play tic-tac-toe, one of the two,\u2019 and so I decided I would try to > write what I really felt was the essence of what we were doing and why we > were doing it. == In popular culture == The article is quoted several times in the 1995 movie Hackers, although in the movie it is being read from an issue of the hacker magazine 2600, not the historically accurate Phrack. The Mentor gave a reading of The Hacker Manifesto and offered additional insight at H2K2. It is also an item in the game Culpa Innata. A poster of the Hacker Manifesto appears in the 2010 film The Social Network in the Harvard room of Mark Zuckerberg. The Hacker Manifesto is mentioned in Edward Snowden's autobiography Permanent Record. == See also == * Hacker ethic * Timeline of computer security hacker history == References == == External links == * Hacker's Manifesto at Phrack Magazine Category:Hacking (computer security) Category:Texts about the Internet Category:Texts related to the history of the Internet Category:Manifestos Category:Hacker culture Category:1986 documents Category:Works about computer hacking ",
