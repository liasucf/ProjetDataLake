She is the author of 19 books including the three-million-copy selling, 1971 Diet for a Small Planet that the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History describes as \u201cone of the most influential political tracts of the times.\" She is the co-founder of three national organizations that explore the roots of hunger, poverty and environmental crises, as well as solutions now emerging worldwide through what she calls Living Democracy. Her most recent books include Daring Democracy: Igniting Power, Meaning, and Connection for the America We Want, coauthored with Adam Eichen, and World Hunger: 10 Myths. with Joseph Collins. In 1987, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"revealing the political and economic causes of world hunger and how citizens can help to remedy them.\" ==Biography== Lapp\u00e9 was born in 1944 in Pendleton, Oregon, to John and Ina Moore and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. After graduating from Earlham College in 1966, she married toxicologist and environmentalist Dr. Marc Lapp\u00e9 in 1967. They had two children, Anthony and Anna Lapp\u00e9. She briefly attended University of California at Berkeley for graduate studies in social work. Lapp\u00e9 has received 19 honorary doctorates from distinguished institutions, including the University of Michigan, Kenyon College, Allegheny College, Lewis and Clark College, Grinnell College and University of San Francisco. In 1987 in Sweden, Lapp\u00e9 became the fourth American to receive the Right Livelihood Award. In 2003, she received the Rachel Carson Award from the National Nutritional Foods Association. She was selected as one of twelve living \"women whose words have changed the world\" by the Women's National Book Association. Throughout her works Lapp\u00e9 has argued that world hunger is caused not by the lack of food but rather by the inability of hungry people to gain access to the abundance of food that exists in the world and/or food-producing resources because they are simply too poor. She has posited that our current \"thin democracy\" creates a mal-distribution of power and resources that inevitably creates waste and an artificial scarcity of the essentials for sustainable living. Lapp\u00e9 makes the argument that what she calls \"living democracy,\" i.e. democracy understood as a way of life, not merely a structure of government. The three conditions essential for democracy, she writes in Daring Democracy and elsewhere, are the wide dispersion of power, transparency, and a culture of mutual accountability, not blaming. These three conditions enable humans to experience a sense of agency, meaning, and connection, which she describes as the essence of human dignity. Democracy is not only what we do in the voting booth but involves our daily choices of what we buy and how we live. She believes that only by \"living democracy\" can we effectively solve today's social and environmental crisis. Lapp\u00e9 began her writing career early in life. She first gained prominence in the early 1970s with the publication of her book Diet for a Small Planet, which has sold several million copies. In 1975, with Joseph Collins, she launched the California-based Institute for Food and Development Policy (Food First) to educate Americans about the causes of world hunger. In 1990, Lapp\u00e9 co-founded the Center for Living Democracy, a 9-year initiative to accelerate the spread of democratic innovations in which regular citizens contribute to problem-solving. She served as founding editor of the Center's American News Service (1995\u20132000), which placed stories of citizen problem-solving in nearly half the nation's largest newspapers.
