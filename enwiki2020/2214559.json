    "text": "A mediated reference theorySiobhan Chapman (ed.), Key Ideas in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language, Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 202. (also indirect reference theory)Leszek Berezowski, Articles and Proper Names, University of Wroc\u0142aw, 2001, p. 67. is any semantic theory that posits that words refer to something in the external world, but insists that there is more to the meaning of a name than simply the object to which it refers. It thus stands opposed to the theory of direct reference. Gottlob Frege is a well- known advocate of mediated reference theories.G. W. Fitch, Naming and Believing, Springer, 2012, p. 1. Similar theories were widely held in the middle of the twentieth century by philosophers such as Peter Strawson and John Searle. Mediated reference theories are contrasted with theories of direct reference. Saul Kripke, a proponent of direct reference theory, in his Naming and Necessity dubbed mediated reference theory the Frege\u2013Russell view and criticized it.Saul Kripke, Naming and Necessity. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27. Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that Bertrand Russell's views on reference theory were the same as Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.Howard Wettstein, \"Frege-Russell Semantics?\", Dialectica 44(1/2), 1990, pp. 113\u2013135, esp. 115: \"Russell maintains that when one is acquainted with something, say, a present sense datum or oneself, one can refer to it without the mediation of anything like a Fregean sense. One can refer to it, as we might say, directly.\" ==See also== * Sense and reference * Descriptivist theory of names ==References== ==External links== * Theories of Meaning (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) Category:Theories of language Category:Meaning (philosophy of language) ",
