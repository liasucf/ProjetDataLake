He attended the seminary in Ribeira Brava in his native island. He later headed to Portugal and studied at the University of Lisbon.

He returned to Portugal again and educated in Leiria for a short time, during the difficulties of relationship with Portuguese politics that occurred that time, he returned to Cape Verde where he continued his education and advocacy. His last days were spent in Lisbon, where he was transferred for treatment of a cerebrovascular disease and died shortly afterwards on May 28, 1989. ==Career== Baltasar Lopes, with the collaboration of other writers, such as Manuel Lopes, Manuel Ferreira, Ant\u00f3nio Aur\u00e9lio Gon\u00e7alves, Francisco Jos\u00e9 Tenreiro, Jorge Barbosa, and Daniel Filipe, founded the Cape Verdean journal Claridade in 1936. Claridade published essays, poems, and short stories. Its contributors wrote about the problems of their society, such as drought, famine, and emigration, bringing clarity to the study of Cape Verdean reality, especially with regard to the most disadvantaged social groups. In 1947, Lopes published his first book, the novel Chiquinho. Chiquinho describes in detail the customs, people, landscapes, and social problems of Cape Verde in early twentieth century. It is a coming-of-age novel about the people of Cape Verde and the step that many Cape Verdeans had to take to achieve a better life: emigration. The novel is organized into three parts: * 1. \"Childhood\" (Inf\u00e2ncia), in which the protagonist Chiquinho lives with his family and community in the village of Caleij\u00e3o on the island of S\u00e3o Nicolau and learns his first letters. * 2. \"S\u00e3o Vicente,\" in which Chiquinho continues his education in high school on the island of S\u00e3o Vicente, where he meets new friends and his first love Nuninha. Chiquinho and his classmates found the Gr\u00e9mio, an association and a journal that is very similar to Claridade, in the sense that it attempts to change the social environment of the archipelago. * 3. \"The Waters\" (As \u00c1guas), the third and final part of the novel, in which Chiquinho returns to his island and becomes a teacher. This part is focused on the calamity of drought, a major problem in Cape Verde, which results in famine and many deaths.
