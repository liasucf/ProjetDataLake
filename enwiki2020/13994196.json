In the 2007 Armenian parliamentary elections the party ran independently and gained 2.74% of the popular vote but failed to win any seats in the National Assembly. Prior to the 2012 Armenian parliamentary election, party leader Karapetyan claimed that his party would win seats, however the party did not participate in the election. In 2014, party leaders announced their dissatisfaction with the government led by the Republican Party of Armenia. The party proposed a new alliance between Prosperous Armenia, the Armenian National Congress and Heritage parties to start a new national movement. A few supportive rallies were held in the capital, Yerevan, shortly after the announcement but no formal alliance was ever established. The party did not participate in the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election. ==Ideology== The party advocates for closer relations with the United States as well as with both European Union and CIS countries. ==See also== *Politics of Armenia *Programs of political parties in Armenia ==References== Category:Conservative parties in Armenia Category:Political parties with year of establishment missing Category:Political parties in Armenia Category:Pro-European political parties Category:Pro-European political parties in Armenia ",
