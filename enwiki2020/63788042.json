In 1948, the executive of the Public Services Federation voted in favour of remaining affiliated to the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). As a result, the minority, led by general secretary Raymond Bomal, left and formed a new union, affiliated to Workers' Force. It also affiliated to the Public Services International. By 1995, the union had 80,250 members, and by 2017, this had grown to a claimed 135,000. ==General Secretaries== :1948: Raymond Bomal :1958: Jacques Bonnore :1973: F\u00e9lix Fortin :1984: :1986: Ren\u00e9 Champeau :1991: Alain Brousseau and Camille Ordronneau :2002: Jean Marie Bellot :2008: Didier Bernus :2016: Yves Kottelat :2019: ==External links== * ==References== Category:Public sector trade unions Category:Trade unions established in 1948 Category:Trade unions in France ",
