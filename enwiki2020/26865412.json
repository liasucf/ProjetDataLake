He was the son of Sir Richard Grosvenor, 1st Baronet and Lettice Cholmondley, daughter of Sir Hugh Cholmondeley. He spent his childhood at Eaton Hall, Cheshire. In 1628 he married Sydney, daughter of Sir Roger Mostyn of Mostyn, Flintshire, thereby also gaining estates in north Wales. Sir Richard was involved in the Civil War on the Royalist side. In 1643 he was High Sheriff of Cheshire and in February of that year outlawed those who supported the Parliamentary cause in the Battle of Edgehill in the previous October. In July 1659, Sir Richard was a supporter of Sir George Booth in the abortive pro-Royalist Cheshire and Lancashire Rising. Sir Richard's son and heir, Roger, was killed in a duel by his cousin, Hugh Roberts, on 22 August 1661. When Sir Richard died in 1665, he was succeeded by his grandson Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet, who was aged only eight at the time. ==References== Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1600s births Category:1665 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Baronet Category:High Sheriffs of Cheshire ",
