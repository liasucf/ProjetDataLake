Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 (30 October 1786 \u2013 29 January 1871) was a French Canadian writer and seigneur. ==Biography== He was born in Quebec City in 1786, the son of seigneur Pierre-Ignace Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 and Catherine Tarieu de Lanaudi\u00e8re, the daughter of seigneur Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Tarieu de La Naudi\u00e8re. The Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 family was distinguished, ennobled by Louis XIV in 1693. Philippe-Joseph's grandfather, Ignace-Philippe Aubert de Gasp\u00e9, fought under Louis-Joseph de Montcalm at Carillon (Ticonderoga). Philippe- Joseph studied at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec. He studied law with Jonathan Sewell and then with Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Perrault and was called to the bar in 1811. Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 served in the local militia, becoming captain. After practising law until 1816, he was appointed sheriff for Quebec district. He became involved in debt, for which he was imprisoned four years, and when released he retired to his ancestral home at Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence. Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 spent thirty years in study there. At the age of seventy-five, he completed a novel, Les Anciens Canadiens (\"Old-Time Canadians\", Quebec, 1863). Almost entirely based on fact, the story illustrates Canadian national tradition, character, and manners. The author interwove events of his own chequered life with the tragic tale of the struggles and the fall of New France and the change of regime, the eyewitnesses of which he had known personally. At that time, it was perhaps the most popular book ever published in Quebec. In 1866, Aubert de Gasp\u00e9 published his M\u00e9moires, which continue and amplify the precious historical notes contained in his other works. Less brilliant and attractive than his novel, the M\u00e9moires are an excellent specimen of anecdotal history. The author's standing and experience, the latter embracing directly or indirectly the space of a century dating from the Conquest, constitute him an authentic chronicler of an obscure yet eventful period of history. He was the last seigneur of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and died at Quebec City in 1871. ==Family== He married Susanne Allison in 1811. Together they had 13 children. Of his daughters, several of them married notable men including, Suzanne who married William Power, a member of the legislative assembly; Ad\u00e9la\u00efde who married Georges-Ren\u00e9 Saveuse de Beaujeu; Charlotte-Elmire who married Andrew Stuart, a judge and seigneur; and Zo\u00e9 who married Charles Joseph Alleyn, who was also mayor of Quebec City. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * Category:1786 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Canadian male non-fiction writers Category:Canadian male novelists Category:Canadian memoirists Category:Canadian novelists in French Category:French Quebecers Category:People from Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:Pre-Confederation Quebec people Category:Writers from Quebec City Category:19th-century Canadian male writers Category:19th-century Canadian novelists Category:19th-century memoirists ",
