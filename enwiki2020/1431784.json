    "text": "The Mummers Parade is held each New Year's Day in Philadelphia. Local clubs (usually called \"New Years Associations\") compete in one of five categories (Comics, Wench Brigades, Fancies, String bands, and Fancy Brigades). They prepare elaborate costumes, performance routines, and movable scenery, which take months to complete. This is done in clubhousesmany of which are on or near 2nd Street (called \"Two Street\" by some local residents) in the Pennsport neighborhood of the city's South Philadelphia sectionwhich also serve as social gathering places for members. The parade has been broadcast since 1993 on WPHL-TV, which has live streamed the event on its website since 2011. After a national campaign to get the parade nationally televised, an edited two-hour broadcast of the parade was picked up by WGN America and WGN-TV; the broadcast debuted January 3, 2009. The parade has been critiqued by local residents, academics, and the media for its racist depiction of minority groups, which, despite an official ban on blackface effective in 1964, has continued to include blackface, brownface, or redface caricatures and other racial and ethnic impersonation, as of 2020's parade.DuComb, Christian.

Philadelphia Department of Recreation. The parade is related to the Mummers Play tradition from Britain and Ireland. Revivals of this tradition are still celebrated annually in South Gloucestershire, England on Boxing Day along with other locations in England and in parts of Ireland on St. Stephen's Day and also in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador around Christmas. Swedes and Finns, the first European colonists in the Philadelphia area, brought the custom of visiting neighbors on \"Second Day Christmas\" (December 26) with them to Tinicum. This was soon extended through New Year's Day with costumed celebrants loudly parading through the city.\"The Philadelphia Tradition\" . Philadelphia Mummers Association. Retrieved November 27, 2007. They appointed a \"speech director\", who performed a special dance with a traditional rhyme: The Mummers derive their name from the Mummers' plays performed in Philadelphia in the 18th century as part of a wide variety of working class street celebrations around Christmas. By the early 19th century, these coalesced with earlier Swedish customs, including the Christmas neighbor visits and possibly shooting firearms on New Year's Day (although this was common in other countries as well) as well as the Pennsylvania German custom of \"belsnickling,\" where adults in disguise questioned children about their behavior during the previous year. U.S. President George Washington carried on the official custom of New Year's Day calls during the seven years he occupied President's House in Philadelphia. The Mummers continued their traditions of comic verse in exchange for cakes and ale. Small groups of up to twenty mummers, their faces blackened, went door to door, shooting and shouting, and adapting the English Mummer's play by replacing the character of \"King George\" with that of \"General Washington.\" Through the 19th century, large groups of disguised (often in blackface) working class young men roamed the streets on New Year's Day, organizing \"riotous\" processions, firing weapons into the air, and demanding free drinks in taverns, and generally challenging middle and upper-class notions of order and decorum. An 1808 law decreed that \"masquerades\" and \"masquerade halls\" were \"common nuisances\" and that anyone participating would be subject to a fine and imprisonment. It was apparently never successfully enforced and was repealed in 1859.Marion, John Francis (January 1981). Smithsonian.\"On New Year's Day in Philadelphia, Mummer's the Word\". rivefrontmummers.com. Archived version retrieved January 4, 2008. Henry Muhlenberg, writing in 1839, reported, \"Men met on the roads in Tinicum and Kingsessing, who were disguised as clowns, shouting at the top of their voices and shooting guns. Unable to suppress the custom, by the 1880s the city government began to pursue a policy of co-option, requiring participants to join organized groups with designated leaders who had to apply for permits and were responsible for their groups actions. The earliest documented club, the Chain Gang, had formed in 1840 and Golden Crown first marched in 1876 with cross-town rivals Silver Crown forming soon after. By 1881, a local report said \"Parties of paraders\" made the street \"almost like a masked Ball.\" By 1900, these groups formed part of an organized, city-sanctioned parade with cash prizes for the best performances. Southern plantation life's contributions include the parade's theme song, James A. Bland's \"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\" (introduced in 1903), as well as the 19th-century cakewalk, dubbed the \"Mummers' Strut\" or the \"2 Street Strut\". The first official parade was held January 1, 1901. The first string band, Trilby, was organized in 1898, first paraded in 1902, and last paraded in 2014.Mummers\u2019 famous Trilby band is sidelined for Philadelphia parade - Reading Eagle Dec. 28, 2014 In the early years of the official parade, the makeshift costumes of most celebrants were gradually replaced by more elaborate outfits funded by associations' fund-raising efforts. The official parade has been cancelled only twice during its history. The first cancellation happened in 1919 as a result of the aftermath of World War I and the second cancellation occurred in 1934 due to the effects of the Great Depression and a lack of prize money. As they assimilated to Philadelphia, many immigrant groups have joined the tradition. Numerous Irish immigrants and Irish-Americans from South Philadelphia became involved in the Mummers Parade as both Mummers performers and parade goers. Other ethnic groups were soon integrated into the parade through the years. Italian-Americans and Italian immigrants to South Philadelphia began to participate in the Mummers Parade in large numbers after World War II. While South Philadelphia (especially Pennsport) remains one of the most important centers for Mummers traditions and Mummers members, more recent immigrants to the neighborhood from Asia and Latin America generally have fewer ties to the parade and tradition.Hepp, Chris (August 7, 2014). \"Mummers Parade going south? City mulls big change\". Philadelphia Inquirer. Retrieved February 2, 2015. While almost all parade participants are currently white, African American mummers existed in the past. The all African American Golden Eagle Club, formed in 1866, had 300 members in the 1906 parade, for example. Judges systematically discriminated against black clubs, however, and the last, the Octavius Catto Club, withdrew after receiving last place in the 1929 parade. The brass bands hired to accompany the Comic Brigades often include black musicians, but do not dress in costume and consider themselves session musicians rather than Mummers. By 1964, only one African American mummer, Willis Fluelling, remained. As of 2007, a few of the less traditional clubs, such as Spiral Q Puppet Theater's West Philadelphia Mummers Brigade, were integrated. The comic \"wenches\" and other female roles in most skits are typically performed by men in drag. Women were not officially allowed in the parade until the 1970s.DeLeon, Clark (Winter 1984/1985). \"Mummers on Parade\".

The 2008 budget crisis led the city to propose closing numerous libraries and firehouses and the scaling back of expenditures for the parade, offering $300,000 for the 2009 parade and nothing for 2010.\"Shortened 2009 Strut?\".

After the end of city funding for the parade, the Mummers created the \"Save the Mummers Fund\" to help cover the additional city fees to paying expenses for police and sanitation services during the event. Funding for the parade during the first decade of the 2000s was provided for several years by Southwest Airlines, which also took naming rights of the parade, which was called \"Southwest Airlines Mummers Parade.\" Funding for the 2012 parade was provided by SugarHouse Casino, which renamed the parade to \"Sugar House Mummers Parade.\" In September 2009, The Bacon Brothers musical duo (comprising Philadelphia natives Michael and Kevin Bacon) recorded a special version of their song \"New Year's Day\" with members of the All-Star String Band.Highsmith, Steve (June 17, 2009). \"The Mummers and Kevin BaconThe Bacon Brothers Band Were Joined in a Philadelphia Studio To Record a Version of Their Song, New Year's Day, with Actual Philly Mummers!\".

After construction was completed, the parade returned to Broad Street from 1996 to 1999. For various reasons, the parade was moved again to Market Street in 2000. In 2004, the parade was moved back to Broad Street. In 1997, the Fancy Brigades were moved to the Pennsylvania Convention Center, allowing for larger sets, but limiting audience size. In 2011, the Fancy Brigades returned to the parade. Each year, thousands of people participate in the parade, many wearing elaborate costumes costing tens of thousands of dollars to make and weighing well over 100 pounds. $395,000 in prizes is awarded to the various winners.\"If You Go: Mummers Parade 2008\". Philadelphia Metro. December 28, 2007. The costs for making the outfits plus fees to choreographers and prop designers often far exceed the prizes available. While club fund-raisers, hall rentals, and bank loans often cover much of the expense, individual members frequently spend hundreds or thousands of dollars of their own money. To raise funds, many string bands and their members seek paying gigs, particularly in area Fourth of July parades, the annual \"Show of Shows\" (held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, each winter), weddings, and other events. Many clubs hold \"beef and beers\" or 50/50 raffles. Most charge annual dues for membership. Strauss, Robert. (December 29, 2008). \"Mummers, Dollars and Change\". Philadelphia Daily News.

On January 1, 2015, the Mummers began their parade route at Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall and headed south along Broad Street to Washington Avenue. The Mummers used the Benjamin Franklin Parkway as a staging area prior to moving to City Hall to be judged. After the judging, the mummers joined the parade heading south on Broad St. The parade ended at Washington Ave, with some clubs still heading east to Second Street for the unofficial \u201cTwo Street Parade\u201d. If an all-day postponement is required for foul weather, the parade is usually held the following Saturday (or Sunday, if Saturday is inclement), as the expensive and fancy costumes are easily harmed by precipitation or high winds. Each year, there is a festival leading up to the parade called MummersFest. It allows fans to tour the Pennsylvania Convention Center to watch the Fancy Brigades build their props and practice for their New Year's Day reveal. ==2nd Street== Philadelphia Mummers Museum at 2nd St and Washington Ave Because of the large number of clubhouses there, South 2nd Street (Two Street) often serves as a party location after the parade, with the center of activity being South 2nd Street and Mifflin Street. Local residents and others in the area for the parade crowd the local bars, clubhouses and sidewalks, sometimes joining in the unofficial parade. With the parade they spent months preparing for finished, the Mummers let loose and celebrate. This multi-block party continues well into the night or early morning, with some Mummers not sleeping for twenty-four hours straight. In 2009, the city declined to pay for any post-parade celebrations on Two Street. However, Rep. Bob Brady helped secure funding for the event in the final hours. ==Controversy== The parade has often included hate speech, racist, sexist, anti-LGBTQ, and culturally insensitive costumes, makeup, and images.Brennan, Chris.

Retrieved January 9, 2008. Growing dissent from civil-rights groups and the offense of the black community led to most clubs phasing out blackface in the early 1960s. In 1963 one week before the parade, concerned about their image for a nationwide broadcast, the Mummers banned blackface for the parade. Angry Mummers picketed the parade magistrate's home, leading to a reversal of the decision. Concerned about a possible riot, the city called in extra police for the parade.Orso, Anna.

's parade, the use of blackface is uncommon, but the use of redface and brownface continues, along with other types of racial and ethnic mimicry. In 1985, South Philadelphia String Band petitioned to use blackface and was denied. In 1987, the mayor at the time, Wilson Goode had Mummers photos removed from City Hall because the Mummers appeared to be wearing blackface. Saying the Mummers were not in blackface, a petition resulted in the photos being restored, though not near the mayor's office. In 1996, half of the string bands reported having female members. The bands' captains, though, made it clear to reporters that they did not want to let women in the bands, but felt they had to, due to declining membership. In 2003, word spread that Slick Duck Comic Brigade was working on a skit involving priests chasing altar boys. Protests from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Diocese of Camden and the Catholic League and WPHL-TV announcing they would not air the skit led to the group cancelling of the skit and claiming it was just a prank. Goodtimers Comic Brigade's 2003 entry highlighted the Mummers' continued use of blackface, skirting of the rules with brown, red, purple and blue makeup and strong references to minstral shows. Mummers have declared the alternate color choices as a direct protest of the longstanding and frequently flouted ban. The Goodtimers' stand in for Al Jolson wore dark blue makeup with kinky hair, backed by \"a minstrel in blackface on a large poster with 'Gone Yes \u2014 Forgotten Never.'\" 2009's B.

In 2016 a group presented a Mexican-themed skit, with all of the performers wearing brownface. The same year, Finnegan New Years Brigade presented a Caitlyn Jenner skit showing her pre-transition on the cover of Wheaties box and after transitioning on the cover of a Froot Loops box. A male Mummer, dressed as Jenner, appeared, mocking her Vanity Fair cover announcing she was transgender. News reports showed a Mummer with the Wheaties/Froot Loops sign screaming \"fuck the gays!\" Social media posts led to two of the Mummers being fired from their day-to-day jobs and ousted from the club. Additional skits that year featured multiple \"Lives Matter\" references and appearances of blackface. In 2020, after members of Froggy Car Wench Brigade wore blackface for the parade, mayor Jim Kenney said the city would end the parade \"if Mummers leadership does not make immediate changes to better control the parade\". City Councilmember Cindy Bass introduced a bill that would hit Mummers who wore blackface with a $75 fine and a five year ban from the parade. ==See also== *Culture of Philadelphia *List of holiday parades ==References== ==Further reading== * (reviewed with excerpt in Chronicle of Higher Education.
