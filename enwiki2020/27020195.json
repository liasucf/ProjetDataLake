    "text": "J. Wayne Wilson (born November 8, 1961 is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of the NCAA Division I men's ice hockey team at Rochester Institute of Technology. == Playing career == Wilson grew up in Montreal but his family moved to Guelph, Ontario when he was sixteen. A defenceman, he played junior hockey for the Guelph Platers in the Ontario Hockey Association, then went on to college at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He played four years (1980\u20131984) for the NCAA Division I Bowling Green Falcons, serving as captain in his senior year and leading the team to the 1984 national championship. He graduated with a degree in health, physical education, and recreation, then went on to get his master's degree in education from Bowling Green in 1987. While a grad student, he helped out as a part-time coach for the hockey team. == Coaching career == After graduating with his masters, he spent one year as an assistant at the University of New Hampshire under coach Bob Kullen, but Kullen fell ill and that left his job in jeopardy. Seeking stability, he accepted a position as an assistant coach at his alma mater in 1988, a position he held through the 1998\u201399 school year. During that time, the Falcons made three NCAA tournament appearances. Several players (Rob Blake, Nelson Emerson and Brian Holzinger) went on to successful careers in the National Hockey League. === Rochester Institute of Technology === In 1999, after five years of seeking a head-coaching position, he was hired to be head coach at Division III Rochester Institute of Technology. He led the RIT Tigers to a nearly-undefeated season in 2000\u201301; their only loss was on home ice in the 2001 national championship game. That year, he won the Edward Jeremiah Award for the top coach in Division III men's hockey. In his first six years at RIT, he compiled a 116\u201331\u201312 record (.767 winning percentage), with four ECAC West regular-season championships, three ECAC West tournament titles, and three NCAA tournament appearances. However, those all came in his first years at RIT; in 2003, the Tigers missed the D-III national tournament for the first time since 1995, and they would never return. In late 2004, despite a couple of \"down\" years for the program (including \"only\" a 13\u20137\u20135 record in 2003\u201304), RIT President Albert J. Simone announced that RIT would move their hockey program up to the Division I level, retaining Wilson as head coach. RIT would join Atlantic Hockey starting in the 2006\u201307 season. The rest of the 2004\u201305 campaign was rough, and the Tigers finished with their worst record of Wilson's tenure to date, including a painful loss to arch- rival Elmira College in which the Tigers squandered a late two-goal lead by allowing a pair of short-handed goals in the last three minutes of regulation. They would eventually lose in overtime 7\u20136. The Tigers' first season as a Division I program, in which they played as an independent was even harder, although the highlight was a home win over the St. Lawrence Saints (ranked #18 in the nation at the time) thanks to a 66 save performance by goaltender Jocelyn Guimond. The Tigers won only nine games that season, mostly against future Atlantic Hockey conference opponents. Since joining Atlantic Hockey in 2006, though, success has been the Tigers' hallmark. They won three regular- season conference championships in four years, and in 2010 they won their first conference tournament. That granted them the conference's autobid into the national tournament, where they stunned Denver and New Hampshire to win the East Regional and advance to the Frozen Four. In 2010, in recognition of reaching the Frozen Four, Wilson won the Spencer Penrose Award, for the top coach in Division I men's ice hockey. He became the first coach to win both the Spencer Penrose Award and the Edward Jeremiah Award. He also signed a five-year contract that year, keeping him at RIT until at least the 2014\u201315 season. During the 2014\u201315 season, Wilson led the Tigers to their second NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level, where they knocked off the #1 overall seed Minnesota State Mavericks in the first round. Following the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Wilson signed a seven-year contract extension with RIT, through the 2022 season. During the 2015\u201316 season, Wilson led the Tigers to a third NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level where they faced the #1 overall seed Quinnipiac Bobcats. Unlike the previous season, there would be no upset as the Tigers were shutout 4\u20130. In ten seasons of Division I play, Wilson has led the Tigers to several victories over nationally ranked teams. Under Wilson's tutelage, the Tigers have defeated at least one nationally- ranked team in nine out of ten Division I seasons. As Head Coach, 35 players went on to sign professional contracts. Notables include Steve Pinizzotto in 2007 who became the first RIT Tiger to sign an NHL contract at the Division 1 level. Chris Tanev signed with the Vancouver Canucks in June 2010 and became the first RIT alumnus to play in the NHL making his debut on January 18, 2011. He has also made his playoff debut in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals suiting up in the Conference Finals for games 3, 4 and 5, and in the Stanley Cup Finals for games 5, 6 and 7. Tyler Brenner signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in March 2011 on a two year entry level contract. == Personal life == Wilson and his wife Lynn live in Pittsford, New York. Their daughter Stephanie Konczos attended Bowling Green State University, and their son Stu Wilson (who played ice hockey for Yale) is a professional ice hockey player. ==Head coaching record== ^RIT was ineligible for the postseason in their first year of conference play. ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:Canadian ice hockey coaches Category:RIT Tigers men's ice hockey coaches Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey players Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:NCAA men's ice hockey national champions ",
