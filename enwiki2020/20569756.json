May 1916 United Shoe Machinery Corporation (sometimes abbreviated USMC) was a U.S.-based manufacturer of various industrial machinery, particularly for the shoe manufacturing industry (so is the corporate name,) which at one time monopolized the American shoe machinery business,United Shoe Machinery Co., Information: A Monthly Digest of Current Events and World Progress Covering Jan. 1915 \u2013 May 1917, v. 3, p. 307. and an important federal government's defense contractor during the World War I, Interbellum years, World War II and the Cold war era, which developed and manufactured various land and aircraft armaments, as well as components for the military hardware made by other manufacturers. Founded in Beverly, Massachusetts, its corporate headquarters were eventually relocated to Boston, with key production facilities scattered around Massachusetts. It had subsidiaries in other countries including British United Shoe Machinery in England. ==History== The Smithsonian National Museum of American History provides the following account of the history of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation. > The United Shoe Machinery Company was formed in 1899 by the consolidation of > three shoe machinery firms in the industry: Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company; > Consolidated McKay Lasting Machine Company; and McKay Shoe Machinery > Company. The new company continued the practice previously followed by its > constituent firms of renting machinery that it manufactured instead of > selling it. After the 1899 merger, United grew quite rapidly. In 1903, it > began construction of a new factory in Beverly, Massachusetts about thirty- > five miles from Boston. At its peak, this company employed 9,000 workers and > produced eighty-five percent of all shoemaking machines in the United > States. By 1910, it had an eighty percent share of the shoe machinery market > with assets reaching forty million dollars, and it had acquired control of > branch companies in foreign countries. In 1917, the United Shoe Machinery > Corporation, incorporated in 1905, absorbed the United Shoe Machinery > Company. The United Shoe Machinery Corporation had its headquarters in > Boston and its main manufacturing plant in Beverly, Massachusetts. In 1968, > the United Shoe Machinery Corporation changed its name to USM Corporation. > In 1976, United Shoe Machinery Company merged with Emhart Industries and > produced the modern-day Emhart Corporation. In 1989, in order to resist a > two billion dollar takeover attempt by a New York investment group (which > included oil heir Gordon P. Getty), Emhart merged with Black & Decker > Corporation. The merged company operates from Black & Decker's headquarters > in Towson, Maryland. The company headquarters in Farmington, Connecticut, > were closed in June 1989.United Shoe Machinery Corporation Records, > 1898\u20131987 by Smithsonian National Museum of American History In December 1947 the US government brought proceedings against USM alleging a breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act in that the company had been a monopoly since 1912. A \"trial of prodigious length\" followed but although the verdict went against USM, the corporation wasn't broken up and the judgement and remedy was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1954. The government renewed its complaint in 1967 but although the District Court ruled nothing had changed, this time the Supreme Court ordered USM to be broken up. It was required to divest a substantial part of its business and change its leasing strategy over a 10-year period, with the sell-off raising $400 million. It continued to innovate within the shoe manufacturing industry, but it also developed such modern inventions as the hot glue gun, the soda can pop-top, the drive mechanism for the lunar module, and pop rivets for the Concorde. However, the attempts at diversification failed to generate enough money and in 1976 the company, heavily in debt, was bought by Emhart Corporation, now Emhart Teknologies, an organisation half its size. In 1987 a management buyout led by the management of British United Shoe Machinery (BUSM) bought the shoe machinery operations, including USM, from Emhart Industries and control of USM then passed to the U.K. as part of the newly created United Machinery Group (UMG). Subsequently, the USM headquarters moved into a new high-tech factory outside Boston. In 1995 UMG was acquired by Venture Capitalists Apax Partners Corporate Finance Limited, but after financial difficulties UMG went into administration in 2000. ==Research and development== The corporation pioneered the development and production of a synthetic leather materials.Ward, A. G. Substitutes for Leather, New Scientist, 5 September 1963, no. 355, p. 502. During the Interbellum era corporate Research Division designed and developed gun mounts, gun turrets, fire control equipment, automatic guns, automatic fuse setting, bomb release equipment, automatic conveying equipment, and automatic rocket projectors, as well as many other things of military interest.His Brogue Livens Field Test of Gun, The Exponent, January 1949, v. 61, no. 1, p. 29. During the postwar years, the corporate engineers experimented intensively with armoured fighting vehicles of modular design, kindred by common chassis, common armor elements, interchangeable armament, automatic loading for weapons, and low weight in order to attain high speeds, coupled with various comfort add-ons provided for the housed crew. ==Production items== ; Armoured fighting vehicles * T54E1 medium tank * Turtle-series, IVI prototype gun motor carriages (33 tons, tracked, turreted, 4-man crew situated below the upper hull line, 600-hp engine, armor thickness 3 to 6 inches, dimensions: 18'7\" long, 9'4\" wide, 7' tall, carrying various promptly interchangeable turrets, different main armament with automatic feed system; plus twin 30 mm driver's coaxial machine gun, one .30 caliber commander's machinegun, and one .50 caliber AA machinegun each; weapon stabilization in addition to driver stabilization, internal air cleaning and air conditioning systems) :* IVI Gun Motor Carriage, quadruple .50 caliber machine gun (main) :* IVI-C Gun Motor Carriage, twin 37 mm guns :* IVI-D Gun Motor Carriage, single-barrel 75 mm tank gun (gunner's compartment separated from the crew compartment, allowing the gunner to move with the weapon in elevation and in azimuth) * prototype heavy armored combat vehicles with oscillating turret * prototype armored combat vehicles with externally mounted main gun ; Gun turrets and armament * tank turrets :* T20E1 (Fisher Body Div. of General Motors) Medium Tank turret mounting the 76 mm M1 gun with an autoloader :* T22E1 (Chrysler's DTA) Medium Tank turret mounting the 75 mm M3 gun equipped with an autoloader :* T77 Gun Motor Carriage multibarrel .50 caliber machine gun mount T89 :* High Speed Harmonic Drive Speed Reducer for slow and stabilized rotation of shipboard or tank heavy gun turrets * tank gunsUnited Shoe Builds Guns For and Against Tanks, Iron Age, October 30, 1941, v. 148, no. 18, p. 95. :* 37 mm tank gun M5 {| align=\"center\" |- valign=\"top\" |T54E1 medium tank, designed and constructed by the United Shoe | | | |} ; Infantry weapons and artillery pieces * 37 mm antitank gun M3 * 37 mm towed antitank gun carriage * shell rammingContracts, Iron Age, October 9, 1941, v. 148, no. 15, p. 95. * fuze setting devices {| align=\"center\" |- valign=\"top\" |M3 antitank gun and carriage, both manufactured by the United Shoe |} ; Weapon systems * aircraft gun turrets :* B-17 Flying Fortress ball turret :* YA-14 Shrike and XP-71 pressurized turretHolley, Irving B.
