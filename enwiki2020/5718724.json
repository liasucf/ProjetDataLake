    "text": "==History== Dr. Mackay was given permission to found the Anglo-Peruvian School on July 13, 1917. In 1919 the primary school expanded into secondary education as well, changing its name to Colegio Anglo-Peruano. The school then consisted of 7 teachers and 271 pupils. In 1924, while the school was still located at its premises on the Plaza Francia, it merged with the American Institute and became a boysonly institution. Through the initiative of Dr. W. Stanley Rycroft and with the collaboration of Dr. Alberto Arca Parr\u00f3, a distinguished teacher at the school, the Leader magazine was founded in 1926. In the words of its first editorial, the Leader aspired to \"be the voice of educational development, and be able to unite the voice of teachers and students in the process of development and reinterpretation of the basic principles of teaching.\" The school moved to its present site in 1930. The thenPresident of Peru, Augusto B. Legu\u00eda, was an honoured guest at the occasion. In 1942, in compliance with the dictates of Government Resolution N\u00b03, announced by the Ministry of Education, the school changed its name again, becoming the Colegio San Andr\u00e9s. The school was opened to female students in 1994. The class of 2004 was the first coeducational class to graduate. ==Philosophy== Since the school was founded under charter from the Free Church of Scotland, the defining ideals of the school are principally derived from the church's philosophy and biblical teachings. The institution, being a religious institution, teaches all its subjects from a Biblical viewpoint, not only for religion and ethics, but also for all aspects of education. ==Notable alumni== Among its former students are: * tenor Luis Alva * sociologist Julio Cotler * Leslie Lee * actor Eduardo Moll * musician Alejandro Bisetti Vanderghem * former Minister of Economy C\u00e9sar V\u00e1squez Baz\u00e1n * former Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Efra\u00edn Goldenberg Schreiber * congressman Humberto Lay * concert pianist Alexandros Kapelis * scientist Dr F\u00e9lix Antonio Bacigalupo Palomino * renowned physician Dante Pe\u00f1aloza Ramella recipient of the 2008 SOUTHERN PERU, cofounder of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia * businessman and former Prime Minister Salom\u00f3n Lerner Ghitis *Alfredo Salazar Southwell, Peruvian Air Force hero *Nicol\u00e1s Lindley L\u00f3pez, 84th President of Peru *Gustavo R.
