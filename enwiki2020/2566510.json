    "text": "The Toyota Avanza is a mini MPV designed and produced by Daihatsu and marketed by Toyota. It is produced in Indonesia and also contract assembled in Malaysia (under Perodua) for the first generation model. Daihatsu designed and manufactures the vehicle, which is then sold by both Daihatsu and Toyota under Daihatsu Xenia and Avanza nameplate respectively under a consigned production and OEM manufacturing agreement. The \"Avanza\" name is taken from the Spanish word \"avanza\", which means \"get moving\" and Italian word \"avanzato\", which means \"advance\", while \"Xenia\" is taken from the Greek word \"Xenia\" (a Greek concept of hospitality), which means \"guest-friendship\". The Avanza is mainly developed as an entry-level MPV. Its spiritual predecessor was the Kijang, whose model program has since been split to two different models (the other being the larger, more expensive Kijang Innova) to expand Toyota's reach in the MPV sector. In addition to Indonesia and Malaysia, the Avanza is sold throughout Southeast Asia, South Africa, Mexico, Pakistan, Nepal, Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Middle East, Caribbean, Egypt and various other African countries. A rebadged version of the car was sold in China under the FAW badge until 2010. , there have been 1 million Avanza/Xenia units sold, including 113,000 exported units. , the Avanza has been sold 1.7 million units, and combined sales with Xenia up to 2.75 million units. , the Avanza has been sold 1.8 million units. The Avanza has been the best-selling car in Indonesia for 13 consecutive years, between 2006 and 2019 respectively. == Development == The Avanza and Xenia were both conceived by Toyota, Daihatsu and its Indonesian subsidiaries in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. At the time, the price of the best-selling Kijang had skyrocketed, while the economy in the country had just recovered from the crisis. Both companies collaborated to create a car that would slot below the Kijang. After the development finished, the Avanza and Xenia were launched in December 2003 for the Indonesian market. Toyota and Daihatsu invested a total of for the project. The project was also referred by Toyota as the U-IMV (Under-IMV) project, a reference to the Innova that sits in a segment above the Avanza which rides on the IMV platform. Unlike the Kijang and the succeeding Kijang Innova that utilises full ladder frame chassis, the Avanza uses a semi- monocoque \"unibody\" chassis construction. The front half of the chassis is ladder frame, while the rear half is monocoque. This hybrid-type chassis also made the car retains the rear-wheel drive layout from the previous generatons of Kijang and its ability to handle heavy loads. According to journalists, it also came with several downsides such as unstable ride during high speeds and unrefined NVH levels. The first-generation Avanza/Xenia was assembled at the first Indonesian Daihatsu plant in Sunter, Jakarta. Between 2008 and 2011, Toyota also manufactured the car in Karawang under contract to meet the high demand. The second-generation model is currently assembled at the same plant as the first generation model and also at the second Daihatsu plant in Karawang, West Java, from April 2013 onwards. == Engines == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" ! colspan=\"7\" |Petrol engines |- !
