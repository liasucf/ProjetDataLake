    "text": "Robin Mark Askwith (born 12 October 1950 http://watch.tvguide.co.uk/engage/45937/96827644-bless_this_house) is an English film actor, best known for his role as Timmy Lea in the Confessions sex comedies series. His debut film role was as the impudent schoolboy, Keating, in the film if.... (1968) which he later reprised in Britannia Hospital (1982). In 1975, at Drury Lane's New London Theatre, he was voted Most Promising Newcomer \u2013 Male at the \"Evening Standard British Film Awards\". Askwith's most recent television role was that of musician Ritchie de Vries in Coronation Street. ==Early life== Askwith was born in Southport, Lancashire, England, the eldest child of Nelson Askwiths and Hazel (n\u00e9e Cookson).England & Wales marriages 1837\u20132008 His father served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and his mother in the Women's Royal Naval Service (popularly and officially known as the Wrens). Askwith is a grand-nephew of the comic Robb Wilton.The Confessions of Robin Askwith by Robin Askwith (Ebury Press) 1999 () ==Education== Askwith was educated at Orley Farm in Harrow, Middlesex, where he made his first stage appearance as the Archangel Gabriel in a Nativity play and appeared in the seniors\u2019 production of The Gondoliers; followed by Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, Middlesex and the University of Bristol reading English and Drama.Robin Askwith The Confessions of Robin Askwith (Ebury Press) 1999 () ==Career== ===Confessions...=== Askwith appeared in many film and television roles before appearing in Antony Balch's Horror Hospital (1973). It is a hybrid of horror and the mild titillation of the later 'Confessions...' films. Around the same time, Askwith also appeared in a Carry On film, Carry On Girls and the spin-off film version of Bless This House television sitcom, both with Sid James. These appearances led film makers Norman Cohen, Greg Smith and Michael Klinger to offer him the starring role in Confessions of a Window Cleaner (1974), in the end directed by Val Guest. The part was turned down by several other candidates, Richard Beckinsale, Richard O'Sullivan, Nicky Henson and Dennis Waterman. The success of the film led to three sequels, Confessions of a Pop Performer, Confessions of a Driving Instructor and Confessions from a Holiday Camp. Although the Confessions series came to an end with Confessions from a Holiday Camp, a fifth and a sixth film, Confessions of a Plumber's Mate and Confessions of a Private Soldier had been planned in 1977. Askwith even expressed a desire to direct Private Soldier, but neither film materialised. Plans to shoot a further made-for-video Confessions film in the 1980s also came to nothing, although by this time he was appearing in the poorly-received ITV sitcom Bottle Boys (1984-1985). ===Stage work=== Askwith's extensive work on stage, includes numerous farces such as Run For Your Wife, Casanova's Last Stand, One For The Road plus the stage Confessions sequel The Further Confessions of a Window Cleaner and Terry Johnson's Dead Funny. From 11 December 2012 \u2013 27 January 2013, he appeared at the Mill at Sonning, Reading, Berkshire in Ray Cooney's farce Caught in the Net. In pantomimes, Askwith has appeared with the Chuckle Brothers in Dick Whittington, with Frank Bruno and Sooty in a Wolverhampton production of Goldilocks and the 3 Bears and in various productions of Aladdin as Abanazar. More unusual stage roles include the title role in a production of Brecht's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, and the Child Catcher in a 2006 touring production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. ===Television work=== Early television roles saw him make appearances in Public Eye, The Main Chance, Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), as well as comedies such as Father, Dear Father and starring in two series of Bottle Boys. He has also had roles in the soap operas EastEnders, Doctors, Hollyoaks and Coronation Street where he played a holiday tour guide named Aidan. The episodes of the soap that featured Askwith were filmed in Malta, close to the island of Gozo where he lived for many years. Askwith returned to Coronation Street on 11 December 2013 as Ritchie de Vries. ==Later career== Askwith's autobiography, The Confessions of Robin Askwith, was published by Ebury Press in 1999. The book documents his early life and acting career, the success of the Confessions films, and his relationship with the actress (and occasional Confessions co-star) Linda Hayden, his common-law wife during the 1970s. He was later married to actress Leonie Mellinger. Askwith made a cameo appearance in the film Run For Your Wife, released in the UK on 14 February 2013. He has been in Coronation Street as Ritchie de Vries, joining the cast in December 2013. His role in the TV comedy drama Benidorm was broadcast in January 2016. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable plainrwheaders\" |- ! Year ! Title !
