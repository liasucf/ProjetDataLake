    "text": "France was represented by Betty Mars, with the song '\"Com\u00e9-com\u00e9die\", at the 1972 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 25 March in Edinburgh. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster ORTF. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Mars performed second in the running order, following Germany and preceding Ireland. \"Com\u00e9-com\u00e9die\" was a song in a distinctively French chanson style which Mars performed in a manner very reminiscent of Edith Piaf. At the close of voting it had picked up 81 points, placing France 11th of the 18 entries. Oddly, for a song which had been regarded as having limited appeal outside Francophone territories, it received its highest mark (9 out of 10) from the two United Kingdom jurors.ESC History - France 1972 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1972 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1972 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1972 in France ",
