She is known for her role as Jane in the television show The Affair and Jenna in the stage musical Waitress, the latter of which marked her debut on Broadway. == Early life == Robinson was born on April 4, 1988 in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish mother and an African-American father. She has joked that her family \"looks like the U.N.\" She attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where Robinson majored in musical theater. While in school she performed in multiple stage productions, UCLA's Awaken A Cappella, and received the Gant Gaither Theater Award from the Princess Grace Foundation-USA. Robinson also received a scholarship from the Jackie Robinson Foundation. == Personal life == In 2012, Robinson married actor Leslie Odom Jr., whom she met in 2008 while auditioning for a role in the musical Once on This Island in Los Angeles. Odom, who is known for originating the role of Aaron Burr in the stage musical Hamilton, served as the musical's assistant director. As Robinson would be replacing an actor who had left the production, Odom was tasked with ensuring that she easily transitioned into the role and the two began a relationship after the show's run ended. On April 23, 2017, the two had their first child, a daughter named Lucille Ruby. ==Performances== ===Stage=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
