In 2007, the film was one of five nominated for \"Best Documentary\" in the Swiss Film Prize, though the prize was taken by Das kurze Leben des Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gutierrez. The film focuses on the aftermath of the hippie migration to Asia, specifically documenting the lives of six hippies who chose to remain in India: Cesare from Italy, Erica and Gillian from South Africa, Hanspeter from Switzerland, Meera from Belgium and Robert from the Netherlands. No longer in their 20s, they are leading the lives of a traditional yogi and a female meditator in retreat, a painter with a local wife and children, designers of beach clothing in Goa, and a farmer who hunts and cares for his cows in the Himalayas. ==Festivals== *International Film Festival of India 2008 *Miami International Film Festival 2007 *Woodstock Film Festival 2007 *Munich International Documentary Film Festival 2006 *DOCNZ International Documentary Film Festival 2006 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Swiss documentary films Category:Documentary films about India Category:2006 films Category:Hippie films Category:Expatriates in India Category:Films shot in India Category:Documentary films about spirituality Category:Documentary films about drugs Category:German-language films Category:English-language films Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:Kannada-language films Category:2006 documentary films Category:Swiss films ",
