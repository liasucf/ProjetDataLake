Filming for the season took place throughout fall 2018, and Randolph was later revealed by ABC as a contestant on December 6, 2018. In the episode which aired on March 4, 2019, Randolph quit the competition after realizing she did not feel ready to become engaged at the end of the season; Randolph breaking up with Underwood caused him to commit the \"fence jump\", which was heavily reported in the media. Randolph later rejoined the season in the following episode, after Underwood revealed to her that he would not propose and had broken up with other finalists Tayshia Adams and Hannah Godwin to be with her. At the live After the Final Rose special airing on March 12, Underwood and Randolph confirmed that they were in a relationship. ==Personal life== Prior to appearing on The Bachelor, Randolph dated professional basketball player Caelan Tiongson for five years. Randolph was in a relationship with Colton Underwood from November 2018 to May 2020. On September 11, 2020, Randolph filed a restraining order against Underwood, alleging that he stalked her outside her Los Angeles apartment and her parents' Huntington Beach house, that he sent harassing text messages using an anonymous number, and that he installed a tracking device underneath her car. At an October 6th hearing, the restraining order was extended by the judge until further court proceedings on November 6th. The same day, Randolph proceeded to file a police report concerning the tracking device installed on her car, alleging that Underwood had planted it. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Role ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 2016, 2019 | Young Once | Herself | Web series |- | 2019 | The Bachelor | Herself | Winner; season 23 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:American Christians Category:Bachelor Nation contestants Category:Biola University alumni Category:Living people Category:People from Huntington Beach, California Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire alumni ",
