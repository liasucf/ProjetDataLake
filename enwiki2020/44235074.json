    "text": "Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9a L\u00e9vy (26 September 1906 \u2013 31 August 1943) was a French school teacher of Jewish origins. During World War II (1939\u201345) she became a member of the French Resistance, was arrested and was later executed. She received several posthumous honors. ==Early years== Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9a L\u00e9vy was born in Auxerre on 25 September 1906. Her grandfather was Alfred L\u00e9vy, Chief Rabbi of France from 1907 to 1919. Her father, who died when she was four, was one of the founders of the first association of French secondary school teachers. Her mother, Bertha Levy, was involved in promoting the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (teachers' training college) at S\u00e8vres. In 1912 Bertha Levy was appointed professor of Humanities at the Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo, Paris. Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy attended the Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo, then went on to study at the Sorbonne, where she received her Agr\u00e9gation (higher teacher's licence) in Classical Literature in 1932. Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy was appointed a teacher at the girls' secondary school in Lille, and then was transferred to the Lyc\u00e9e Victor Duruy in Paris. She next moved to the Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo, where she had formerly been a student, and taught Greek and Latin. ==World War II== During World War II (1939\u201345) Paris was occupied by the Germans under the Nazi regime. On 4 October 1940 the first anti-Jewish decree was promulgated prohibiting Jews from public office, and Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy was forced to leave the school. Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy was offered refuge in a village in the Alps by some friends, but decided to remain in Paris and joined the resistance group called the Groupe du mus\u00e9e de l'Homme (\"Museum of Man Group\"). She distributed leaflets and journals, including the speech by Winston Churchill of 21 October 1940 in which he said \"Gather your strength for the dawn, for the dawn will come.\" She distributed the clandestine paper R\u00e9sistance. She tried to recruit Andr\u00e9 Becker, but he did not take the mus\u00e9e de l'Homme very seriously and did not respond. He was later active in the resistance. After her group was disbanded she joined the Hector network. Using a radio transmitter hidden in her home, Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy sent information about German equipment and troop movements to London. Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy was denounced, and was arrested by the Germans on 25 October 1941. She was held in La Sant\u00e9 Prison in Paris, then on 11 February 1942 was transferred to Germany under the Nacht und Nebel (\"Night and Fog\") decree, which removed prisoners without trace. She was imprisoned in Aachen and then in Essen. She was brought before a court in Koblenz on 30 April 1943 and sentenced to death. She was executed by decapitation at Cologne on 31 August 1943. Her mother and sister were also deported in 1943. Only her mother survived. ==Posthumous honors== Mont Val\u00e9rien M\u00e9morial de la France combattante (2009) After the war Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy's remains were returned to France and buried at Fort Mont-Val\u00e9rien in Suresnes during an impressive ceremony on 11 November 1945. Fifteen resistance fighters were reburied during the ceremony, including two women \u2013 Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy and Berty Albrecht. The fifteen bodies, which had been kept at the Arc de Triomphe beside the grave of the Unknown Soldier, had great symbolic importance, representing the dead of the different battles. Eleven had died \"facing the enemy\" and four represented the martyrs of France. The presence of Ren\u00e9e Levy symbolized the re-acceptance of the Jews as a part of the nation, after their exclusion during the Vichy period. Of at least equal importance, she and Raymond Bigosse represented the deported resisters. Ren\u00e9e L\u00e9vy was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and was awarded the Croix de guerre and the Resistance Medal. A 1.60 franc postage stamp in her honor was issued from November 1983 to October 1984. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:1906 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Recipients of the Resistance Medal Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France) ",
