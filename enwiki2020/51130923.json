With recommendations from the Ministry of Correctional Services, the Executive Council of Ontario presented the matter to the Chief Justice of Ontario. Chief Justice George Alexander Gale appointed Honorable Judge B. Barry Shapiro as the Commissioner in 1974 who presented its recommendations to the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario Pauline Mills McGibbon in 1978.Shapiro, B. Barry.
