HNL) is the 25th season of the Croatian Second Football League, the second level football competition for men's association football teams in Croatia, since its establishment in 1992. The season started on 14 August 2015 and will end on 21 May 2016. The league is contested by twelve teams and played in a triple round robin format, with each team playing every other team three times over 33 rounds. At the end of the previous season Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107 were promoted, returning to the top flight after two seasons, while Bistra were relegated in their d\u00e9but season. Pomorac were also relegated due to financial insolvency. Bistra and Pomorac were replaced by Dinamo II and \u0160ibenik, after winning their respective Croatian Third Football League divisions. ==Teams== On 20 April 2015, Croatian Football Federation announced that the first stage of licensing procedure for 2015\u201316 season was completed. For the 2015\u201316 Druga HNL, only nine clubs were issued a second level license: Dinamo II, Gorica, Hajduk Split II, Imotski, Istra 1961, Mosor, Rijeka II, Rude\u0161 and Sesvete. In the second stage of licensing procedure clubs that were not licensed in the first round appealed the decision. On 20 May 2015, all remaining Druga HNL were granted second division license. ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Club ! City / Town ! Stadium ! 2014-15 result !
