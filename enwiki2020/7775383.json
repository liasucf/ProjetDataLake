Retrieved March 22, 2007. ==\"Future Bassoon\" system== Weisberg introduced a new bassoon which he claimed was \"absolutely unable to crack. Perfect slurs on the most problematic notes. Never having to flick again. Ease of fingering. Better quality and pitch on six of the worst notes. This is what the Weisberg System promises and delivers, and it does all of this automatically, with no new fingerings to learn.\"Future Bassoon system website. Retrieved March 22, 2007.

Jordan has inherited the mantel of president for \"Future Bassoon\" and has changed the name to \"Weisberg Systems, LLC\". \"Weisberg Systems, LLC\" have been implementing the no-flick system on many bassoons and continue to be a viable option for bassoonists everywhere. ==Selected compositions== * Duo for Bassoon and Piano (1984) * Piece for Viola Solo (1984) * Piece for Piano (1984) * Duo for Cello and Piano (1985) * Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano (1985) * Quintet for Clarinet and String Quartet (1986) * Quintet for Horn and String Quartet (1986) * Sonatina for Flute (1986) * String Quartet No.1 * Music for Double Woodwind Quintet (1987) * Two Pieces for String Quartet (String Quartet No.2) (1987) * Duo for Violin and Piano (1988) * Birthday Piece for Viola and Bassoon (1991) * A Song and a Dance for Solo Bassoon (1992) * From the Deep for Two Contrabassoons and Piano * Concerto for Bassoon and Strings (1998) * 15 Etudes for Bassoon Written in the Style of 20th Century Music (2004) ==References== ==External links== *Indiana University biography *Weisberg's \"Future Bassoon\" system *Interview with Arthur Weisberg by Bruce Duffie, April 30, 1997 * Weisberg Systems, LLC Category:American classical bassoonists Category:1931 births Category:2009 deaths Category:The High School of Music & Art alumni Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:Juilliard School faculty Category:20th-century American musicians Category:20th-century classical musicians Category:Educators from New York City Category:Classical musicians from New York (state) ",
