He started making vlogs and parodies of other personalities on social media, including parodies of makeup tutorials. He also made videos of him scaring his partner William Murray, by way of sneaking up behind him and yelling his name, which gained the attention of Channel 4's Rude Tube. His videos made appearances on the show, further elevating his image in the media. In that year, Kavanagh started making regular appearances on the Irish radio station SPIN 1038, where he discussed recommendations of activities to do in Dublin at the weekend, and the TV3 fashion show Xpos\u00e9. ===2016: The beginning of Currabinny=== In February 2016, Kavanagh left PR management to pursue a career in food with his partner William Murray, a graduate from the Ballymaloe Cookery School. They created the food company Currabinny named after Murray's hometown in Co. Cork. Their first public appearance was at the Teeling Whiskey Food Market in March 2015, where they sold their own food, including a banana, pecan and white chocolate loaf and \"Glamnilla\" biscuits, which went viral on Twitter. They made a few more appearances at food festivals around Ireland, including hosting the Teeling Whiskey Harvest Supper in November 2016. Throughout November of that year, Kavanagh and Murray were contestants on the RT\u00c92 cooking competition show The Taste of Success. They entered their pecan and white chocolate banana loaf as their dish. They made it to the semi-finals of the show before losing to Michele Kilkenny. In April 2016, as part of Autism Awareness Month, James filmed an interview with his nephew Se\u00e1n on Snapchat about his personal experience and insight of having autism. The interview gained popularity appearing on the DailyEdge.ie and The Irish Examiner news websites,The Today Show in the United States and Channel 9 in Australia. Parents and schoolteachers called the interview inspirational and gave them an insight of their own children's difficulties with autism. === 2018: Television career and The Currabinny Cookbook === Kavanagh began his television career in 2018 for the first series of Ireland's Got Talent as the co-host of companion sister show Ireland's Got M\u00f3r Talent on TV3 (now Virgin Media Television) alongside Glenda Gilson, and is set to host the upcoming second series beginning in 2019. In December 2016, Penguin Books approached Currabinny to write a cookbook with their recipes. Kavanagh and Murray produced the pair's first book, The Currabinny Cookbook, and it was published by Penguin on 4 October 2018. On 29 November that year, the book was chosen as the winner of the EUROSPAR Cookbook of the Year at the An Post 2018 Irish Book Awards As of 2018, Kavanagh has been largely inactive on Snapchat, instead favouring the platform Instagram for the stream of content he is principally known for, which too has a story feature in the vain of the app. He also posts occasionally to a personal YouTube channel that consists of travel vlogs and comedic content, often with more cinematic editing and production values; the earliest video on his channel dates back to 2013, one of many older uploads that have since been removed. ==Personal life== Kavanagh is pro-choice and was very prolific and active in his support of the movement to repeal the Eighth Amendment of Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann ahead of the referendum held on it in May 2018. Kavanagh lives with his partner William Murray, a Ballymaloe trained chef and freelance artist. As an artist, William is known for his graphic depictions of male nudes and his cultural sensibilities stemming from his childhood home. The two met through the gay hookup app, Grindr. Reluctant to meet at first, as Murray's profile had been blank, Kavanagh has stated that it was Williams \u2018superb grammar and punctuation\u2019 that led him to eventually meet Murray. The two men met for a coffee in Powerscourt Centre on Dublin's Clarendon Street, and have since remained together as a couple. In May 2018, the two adopted a Welsh Sphynx cat whom they named after Diana, Princess of Wales. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Irish Internet celebrities Category:Video bloggers Category:People from Churchtown, Dublin Category:LGBT entertainers from Ireland Category:People educated at Wilson's Hospital School ",
