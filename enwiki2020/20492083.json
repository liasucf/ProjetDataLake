The team enjoyed nearly no success in cup competitions as they were knocked out in their first match of every cup apart from the Welsh Cup which they went on to win by beating local rivals Swansea Town in the final. John Toshack would go on to finish the season with a total of 31 goals in all competitions, equalling the record set by Hughie Ferguson in the 1926\u201327 season that would not be beaten until 2003 when Robert Earnshaw finished with a total of 35 goals. ==Players== ==League standings== ==European Cup Winners Cup== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Date!!Round!!Opponent!!Venue!!Result!!Attendance!!Scorers |- | 18 Sep || One (first leg) || FC Porto || H || D 2 \u2013 2 || 19,202 || Toshack, Bird |- | 2 Oct || One (second leg) || FC Porto || A || L 1 \u2013 2 || Approx. 60,000 || Toshack |} ==See also== *Cardiff City F.C. seasons ==References== * * *Welsh Football Data Archive Category:Cardiff City F.C. seasons Category:Association football clubs 1968\u201369 season Card ",
