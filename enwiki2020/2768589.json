    "text": "PageMill is a WYSIWYG HTML editor developed by Adobe Systems. ==History== Ceneca Communications Inc. developed the original PageMill and SiteMill products. During open beta testing, Adobe acquired the company and rebranded the product with their own logo. Adobe released PageMill 1.0 in late 1995. Adobe began shipping PageMill for the Macintosh priced at $99. It was considered revolutionary at the time, as it was the first HTML editor that was considered user-friendly, cited as the \"PageMaker of the WWW\". This first version, however, was also criticized for lacking items such as a spell- checker and support for creating HTML tables. Adobe acquired Ceneca in 1996. Adobe PageMill 2.0, which was introduced in early 1997, corrected these issues with a package that, according to one review, \"adds more features than I have fingers and toes\u2026 PageMill with its tables, frames, graphics, and support for form interfaces, makes it easy to lay out a page\". Adobe PageMill 3.0, released in early 1999, supported embedded font commands and a site-management feature. It was discontinued in February 2000, due to the acquisition and promotion of Adobe GoLive. A later patch, still available from Adobe, fixed a problem with FTP upload. PageMill was often bundled with other products such as scanners or promotional CD-ROMs, rather than sold as a stand-alone product. ==See also== *List of HTML editors *History of the Internet ==References== ==External links== * Adobe PageMill, About.com * Writing and Editing Your Web Pages, Fermilab National Laboratory LInC Online * Internet archive software library including Pagemill 2 & 3 for mac and windows Category:C++ software PageMill Category:HTML editors Category:1994 software ",
