In 1994, he made his debut in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense, moving to Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas for a further season. In 1997\u201398, both Mena and goalkeeper Carlos Roa were bought by Spain's RCD Mallorca. Eminently a defensive-minded player, the former scored seven La Liga goals during the campaign, helping the Balearic Islands team finish fifth straight from the second level as well as to a runner-up finish in the Copa del Rey. Subsequently, Mena signed with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he faced stiff competition for a starting job and also suffered from injuries. He resumed his career in Spain in its second, third and fourth tiers, with a quick return to Argentina with Olimpo de Bah\u00eda Blanca in between. ==Coaching career== Mena retired from the game in February 2005, making a return to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid later on, appearing for its indoor soccer side. Subsequently, he began his coaching career, first with the Colchoneros' youths then acting as assistant to the C-team. On 10 February 2014, following a division three loss at CD Sari\u00f1ena which left Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B in the relegation zone, Mena replaced Alfredo Santaelena, who had also played for the club in the 90s, as head coach.Mena releva a Alfredo en el banquillo del Atl\u00e9tico B (Mena relieves Alfredo in Atl\u00e9tico B bench); Marca, 10 February 2014 (in Spanish) ==References== ==External links== *Argentine League statistics * * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Defensores de Cambaceres footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas footballers Category:Olimpo footballers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:Racing de Santander players Category:CD Toledo players Category:UD Las Palmas players Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Argentine football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B managers Category:Argentine expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Spain ",
