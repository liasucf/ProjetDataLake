Some also involved sexual assault. He became known as \"The Railroad (or Railway) Killer\" as most of his crimes were committed near railroads where he had jumped off the trains he was using to travel about the country. On June 21, 1999, he briefly became the 457th fugitive listed by the FBI on its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list before surrendering to the Texas authorities on July 13, 1999. He was convicted of murder and was executed by lethal injection. Res\u00e9ndiz had many aliases but was chiefly known and sought after as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. One of his aliases, \u00c1ngel Reyes Res\u00e9ndiz, was very close to the name \u00c1ngel Leoncio Reyes Recendis listed on his birth certificate.

After each murder, he would linger in the homes for a while, mainly to eat; he took sentimental items and laid out the victims' driver's licenses to learn about their lives. He stole jewelry and other items and gave them to his wife and mother, who lived in Rodeo, Durango, Mexico. Much of the jewelry was sold or melted down. Some of the items that were removed from the homes were returned by his wife and mother after his surrender. Money was sometimes left at the scene. He raped some of his female victims; however, rape served as a secondary intent. Most of his victims were found covered with a blanket or otherwise obscured from immediate view. ==Victims== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Number ! Name ! Sex ! Age ! Date of Murder !
