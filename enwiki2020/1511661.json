    "text": "Castro station is a Muni Metro station at the intersection of Market Street, Castro Street, and 17th Street in The Castro district of San Francisco, California. Service at the station began on June 11, 1980. ==Station layout== F-Market streetcar on the surface at 17th and Castro in 1999 The station consists of two side platforms next to the tracks on the second level down with the concourse mezzanine level overlooking it. Uniquely among Muni Metro stations, the platforms are slightly curved due to the transition from the Market Street subway to the Twin Peaks Tunnel between this station and the now-disused Eureka Valley station, just southwest. At both Castro Street Station and Church Street Station, there is only one stairway on each side of Market Street leading into the station. (All other stations on the Market Street subway have entrances spread out along the length of the station.) One of these entrances is located in Harvey Milk Plaza on the south-west corner of Market and Castro, and the other is on the north-west corner of Market and 17th. Muni plans to construct accessibility improvements, including a second elevator, in Harvey Milk Plaza at the south entrance of the station. , the $14.5 million project is projected to be complete in 2022. A 2020 determination that the plaza is eligible for inclusion on the California Register of Historical Resources is not expected to impact elevator construction, but may stall the larger plaza project. ==References== ==External links== Category:Muni Metro stations Category:Castro District, San Francisco Category:Market Street (San Francisco) Category:Railway stations located underground in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1980 ",
