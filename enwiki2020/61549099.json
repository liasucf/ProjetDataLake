    "text": "Snake is an artwork by Australian artist Sir Sidney Nolan. The work, composed between 1970 and 1972, consists of 1,620 panels arranged so that the images on each panel form a larger image of a snake. The work is part of the collection of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart, Australia. Nolan is believed to have created the work after \"he saw a mural in a Beijing palace that moved him to create an Australian version, inspired by the desert in springtime\" David Walsh, the owner of MONA, purchased the painting in 2005 for AUD$2m. Walsh modified his initial design for MONA to make space for the work. Before being displayed at MONA, the work had only been exhibited twice before, in England and Ireland. ==References== Category:Paintings by Sidney Nolan Category:Snakes in art ",
