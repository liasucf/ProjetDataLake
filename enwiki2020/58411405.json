    "text": "Adult Attachment disorder (AAD) is the result of untreated Attachment Disorder, or Reactive Attachment Disorder, that develops in adults when it goes untreated in children. It begins with children who were disallowed proper parent-guardian relationships early in their youth, or were abused by an adult in their developmental stages in life. Belonging to the study of attachment theory, causes and symptoms are rooted in human relationships over the course of one's lifetime, and how these relationships developed and functioned. Symptoms typically focus around neglect, dysfunction, abuse, and trust issues in all forms of their relationships. These symptoms are similar to those of other attachment disorders, but focus more on relationships later in life rather than those in earlier years. To be considered to be suffering from AAD, you must demonstrate at least 2-3 of its symptoms. These symptoms include: impulsiveness, desire for control, lack of trust, lack of responsibility, and addiction. While the DSM-V does not recognize it as an official disorder, Adult Attachment disorder is currently being studied by several groups and treatment is being developed. Some of these studies suggest splitting AAD into two groups, avoidance and anxious/ambivalent. More >recent and advanced medical practice advocates for four categorisations; *Secure: Low on avoidance, low on anxiety. *Avoidant: High on avoidance, low on anxiety. *Anxious: Low on avoidance, high on anxiety. *Anxious and Avoidant: High on avoidance, high on anxiety. == Symptoms and specifics == Adult Attachment Disorder develops when an attachment disorder, such as Reactive Attachment Disorder, goes untreated in youth and continues on into adulthood. Although symptoms are no longer carbon copies of what they were in childhood, they are significantly similar to them. Some researchers have begun to suggest that this is because adult relationships are similar to the relationship between infants and caregivers in that they are a type of attachment. Similarities between the two types of relationships include, but are not limited to: a feeling of safety when in proximity to your partner, close contact, shared interest and preoccupation with each other, and engaging in \"baby talk\". While there are similarities to other attachment disorders, Adult Attachment Disorder is starting to be recognized as its own disease due to some of the symptoms that are not present like in other attachment disorders. Some of these symptoms include: greater likelihood of addiction, impulsiveness, behaviors that are socially negative or inappropriate, desire for control, trust issues, unwillingness to accept responsibility, helplessness, anxiety, superficial positivity and depression. Even though the DSM-V does not yet recognize Adult Attachment Disorder per se, many places are doing research on it and proposing therapies to help deal with the disorder. There are many different levels of severity dealing with the disorder. All of them could benefit from therapy. There are multiple types of therapies that have claimed to at least partially treat this disorder. Some meant for prevention of disorders, mostly families who have experienced these disorders prior. Other therapies include outpatient, residential and wilderness therapy. Most of the therapies researched emphasize effective communication, as well as problem solving strategies. They also focus on finding the roots to the attachment that most likely evolved sometime in early childhood. Included in these is a controversial treatment known as attachment holding or \"in arms\" treatment available for caregivers and adolescents. This therapy believes a child must release their frustration with caregivers before they are able to trust them. == Society and Culture == * Adolf Hitler: Aggressive, disapproving father who was abusive to him in his childhood * Saddam Hussein: Abused by stepfather; neglected by mother * Edgar Allan Poe: Father disappeared and mother died in early years; foster father both spoiled and aggressively disciplined him in his youthMeyers, Jeffrey (1992).
