    "text": "\"Pretty Girl\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Maggie Lindemann. It is her first major-label single, and was released on September 30, 2016, through 300 Entertainment. The song was written by Lindemann, Sasha Sloan, and Sean Myer, with the production being handled by Jayson DeZuzio. ==Background== Lindemann said in an interview with Billboards Braudie Blais-Billie: ==Critical reception== Jeff Nelson of People said \"in the defiant pop track, Lindemann, 18, blasts haters and affirms that she's more than her appearance\" and called it an \"infectious single\". Idolator's Mike Wass stated that \"Pretty Girl\" is \"something of a departure from her independent fare. The dark and gloomy sound of the 18-year-old's early material has given way to a more defiant and optimistic approach\" and later claimed \"I preferred the diva's dark-pop phase, but the song has an important message\". Hugh McIntyre of Forbes called it \"a catchy pop number\" but later remarked that the song is \"off to a fair start on streaming sites, but will she be able to break through and become a mainstream hitmaker? It wouldn't be out of the question for a social star to top the charts, so don't laugh off the possibility\". ==Music video== A music video for the song, directed by Roman White, was released on March 9, 2017. ===Background=== In an interview with People, Lindemann said: ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Europe (Euro Digital Song Sales) | 15 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Malaysia (RIM) | 18 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico (Mexico Ingles Airplay) | 9 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100) | 27 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- |+ Cheat Codes x CADE Remix version ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100) | 63 |} ===Year- end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 60 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) | 62 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 39 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Germany (Official German Charts) | 68 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Stream Top 40) | 69 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Top 100) | 57 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 22 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 28 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | September 30, 2016 | Digital download | Original | rowspan=\"5\"| 300 | |- | January 13, 2017 | Music download | YE Remix | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | January 17, 2017 | Top 40 radio | Original | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | February 10, 2017 | Music download | Taylor Wise Remix | |- | March 3, 2017 | Music download | Cheat Codes X Cade Remix) | |} ==References== Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:Body image in popular culture Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Songs written by Sasha Sloan ",
