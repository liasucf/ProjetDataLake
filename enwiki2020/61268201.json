Chola bronze, 12th century, Tanjore, India Shiva Rea was born in Hermosa Beach, California, in 1967; her father, liking the image of Nataraja, dancing Shiva, named her after that Hindu deity. She studied dance anthropology at UCLA, completing her master's thesis in 1997 on \"hatha yoga as a practice of embodiment\". She studied under yoga and tantra masters including Swami Sivananda Saraswati and Daniel Odier. She practised the vigorous Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga for ten years, adopting a more restorative style when she became pregnant. She teaches Vinyasa flow yoga, having created her own style called Prana Vinyasa, and yoga trance dance. She teaches in the USA and many countries around the world, touring each year. Teachers are similarly trained in the USA and around the world in 200, 300 and 500 hour courses in her Prana Vinyasa yoga, which claims to combine tantra, yoga, and ayurveda. She has contributed to publications including Yoga Journal and Yoga International. ==Honours and distinctions== The author and yoga therapist Janice Gates honoured Rea with a chapter of her 2006 book Yoginis.

She has been called one of America's leading yoga teachers.
