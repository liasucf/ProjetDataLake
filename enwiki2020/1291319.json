    "text": "A time-invariant (TIV) system has a time-dependent system function that is not a direct function of time. Such systems are regarded as a class of systems in the field of system analysis. The time-dependent system function is a function of the time-dependent input function. If this function depends only indirectly on the time-domain (via the input function, for example), then that is a system that would be considered time-invariant. Conversely, any direct dependence on the time-domain of the system function could be considered as a \"time-varying system\". Mathematically speaking, \"time-invariance\" of a system is the following property: :Given a system with a time-dependent output function y(t), and a time-dependent input function x(t); the system will be considered time-invariant if a time-delay on the input x(t + \\delta) directly equates to a time-delay of the output y(t + \\delta) function. For example, if time t is \"elapsed time\", then \"time-invariance\" implies that the relationship between the input function x(t) and the output function y(t) is constant with respect to time t: ::y(t) = f( x(t), t ) = f( x(t)). In the language of signal processing, this property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a direct function of time except as expressed by the input and output. In the context of a system schematic, this property can also be stated as follows: :If a system is time-invariant then the system block commutes with an arbitrary delay. If a time-invariant system is also linear, it is the subject of linear time-invariant theory (linear time-invariant) with direct applications in NMR spectroscopy, seismology, circuits, signal processing, control theory, and other technical areas. Nonlinear time-invariant systems lack a comprehensive, governing theory. Discrete time-invariant systems are known as shift-invariant systems. Systems which lack the time-invariant property are studied as time-variant systems. == Simple example == To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems: * System A: y(t) = t x(t) * System B: y(t) = 10 x(t) Since the System Function y(t) for system A explicitly depends on t outside of x(t), it is not time-invariant because the time-dependence is not explicitly a function of the input function. In contrast, system B's time-dependence is only a function of the time-varying input x(t). This makes system B time-invariant. The Formal Example below shows in more detail that while System B is a Shift-Invariant System as a function of time, t, System A is not. == Formal example == A more formal proof of why systems A and B above differ is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition will be used. : _System A:_ Start with a delay of the input x_d(t) = x(t + \\delta) ::y(t) = t x(t) ::y_1(t) = t x_d(t) = t x(t + \\delta) :Now delay the output by \\delta ::y(t) = t x(t) ::y_2(t) = y(t + \\delta) = (t + \\delta) x(t + \\delta) :Clearly y_1(t) e y_2(t), therefore the system is not time-invariant. : _System B:_ Start with a delay of the input x_d(t) = x(t + \\delta) ::y(t) = 10 x(t) ::y_1(t) = 10 x_d(t) = 10 x(t + \\delta) :Now delay the output by \\delta ::y(t) = 10 x(t) ::y_2(t) = y(t + \\delta) = 10 x(t + \\delta) :Clearly y_1(t) = y_2(t), therefore the system is time-invariant. More generally, the relationship between the input and output is : y(t) = f(x(t), t), and its variation with time is :\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{\\mathrm{d} t}. For time-invariant systems, the system properties remain constant with time, : \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} =0. Applied to Systems A and B above: : f_A = t x(t) \\qquad \\implies \\qquad \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial t} = x(t) eq 0 in general, so not time- invariant : f_B = 10 x(t) \\qquad \\implies \\qquad \\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial t} = 0 so time-invariant. == Abstract example == We can denote the shift operator by \\mathbb{T}_r where r is the amount by which a vector's index set should be shifted. For example, the \"advance-by-1\" system :x(t+1) = \\delta(t+1) * x(t) can be represented in this abstract notation by :\\tilde{x}_1 = \\mathbb{T}_1 \\tilde{x} where \\tilde{x} is a function given by :\\tilde{x} = x(t) \\forall t \\in \\R with the system yielding the shifted output :\\tilde{x}_1 = x(t + 1) \\forall t \\in \\R So \\mathbb{T}_1 is an operator that advances the input vector by 1. Suppose we represent a system by an operator \\mathbb{H}. This system is time-invariant if it commutes with the shift operator, i.e., :\\mathbb{T}_r \\mathbb{H} = \\mathbb{H} \\mathbb{T}_r \\forall r If our system equation is given by :\\tilde{y} = \\mathbb{H} \\tilde{x} then it is time-invariant if we can apply the system operator \\mathbb{H} on \\tilde{x} followed by the shift operator \\mathbb{T}_r, or we can apply the shift operator \\mathbb{T}_r followed by the system operator \\mathbb{H}, with the two computations yielding equivalent results. Applying the system operator first gives :\\mathbb{T}_r \\mathbb{H} \\tilde{x} = \\mathbb{T}_r \\tilde{y} = \\tilde{y}_r Applying the shift operator first gives :\\mathbb{H} \\mathbb{T}_r \\tilde{x} = \\mathbb{H} \\tilde{x}_r If the system is time-invariant, then :\\mathbb{H} \\tilde{x}_r = \\tilde{y}_r == See also == *Finite impulse response *Sheffer sequence *State space (controls) *Signal-flow graph *LTI system theory *Autonomous system (mathematics) ==References== Category:Control theory Category:Signal processing ",
