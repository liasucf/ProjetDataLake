    "text": "is a 45,000 seat retractable roof stadium in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It was built in 2001 and is often used as home to the J1 League club Nagoya Grampus. The stadium is football-specific, which gives matches an authentic football aura; however, its location outside Nagoya city makes it impractical for consolidating the club's fan base in its billed hometown. It is also used by Toyota Verblitz, a rugby union team in the Top League. Its roof is unique in that it folds much like an accordion; however, the roof has never been closed since 2015 due to extra costs for maintenance. Toyota Stadium is one of the venues of the FIFA Club World Cup (formerly the Toyota Cup). The stadium was also used as one of the venues for 2019 Rugby World Cup, the first Rugby World Cup to be held in Asia. ==Football international matches== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Team 1 !Score !Team 2 !Competition !Attendance |- | 24 May 2005 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20130 || || 2005 Kirin Cup || 6,536 |- | 24 May 2008 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20130 || || 2008 Kirin Cup || 40,701 |- | 03 Mar 2010 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20130 || || 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification || 38,042 |- | 19 June 2011 || || style=\"text- align:center;\"|2\u20130 || || 2012 Summer Olympics qualification || 17,873 |- | 29 Feb 2012 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131 || || 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification || 42,720 |- | 30 May 2013 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20132 || || 2013 Kirin Cup || 41,353 |- | 14 November 2014 || || style=\"text- align:center;\"|6\u20130 || || 2014 Kirin Cup || 42,126 |- | 3 June 2016 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|2(4)\u20132(3) || || 2016 Kirin Cup || 4,500 |- | 3 June 2016 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\u20132 || || 2016 Kirin Cup || 41,940 |- | 6 October 2017 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20131 || || 2017 Kirin Cup || 38,461 |- | 20 November 2018 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\u20130 || || 2018 Kirin Cup || 38,353 |- | 5 June 2019 || || style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20130 || || 2019 Kirin Cup || 38,507 |- |} ==2019 Rugby World Cup matches== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- !Date !Time (JST) !Team #1 !Res. !Team #2 !Round !Attendance |- |23 September 2019||19:15||||style=\"text- align:center;\"|43\u201314||||Pool D||35,546 |- |28 September 2019||18:45||||style=\"text-align:center;\"|57\u20133||||Pool B|| 36,449 |- |5 October 2019|||19:30||||style=\"text-align:center;\"|38\u201319||||Pool A ||39,695 |- |12 October 2019||13:45||||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0-0||||Pool B ||Match cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis |- |} ==See also== * List of sports venues with the name Toyota ==References== ==External links== * Official Website * FIFA Profile Category:Football venues in Japan Category:Rugby union stadiums in Japan Category:Retractable-roof stadiums in Japan Category:Nagoya Grampus Category:Sports venues in Aichi Prefecture ",
