Slowly, the pandemic spread to various states and union territories including the state of Telangana. The first case was recorded in this region on 2 March from a man who had travel history with the UAE. High Positivity Rate: Positivity Rate can be loosely defined as the number of patients turning positive for coronavirus upon testing per every 100 suspects. This rate can be calculated either on a daily basis or on a cumulative basis on the total number of tests conducted. In this parameter, Telangana state fares as one of the worst performing state in India with very high positivity rate. As per the health bulletin issued by Government of Telangana on June 30, Telangana state claims to have conducted a cumulative number of 88563 tests of which, 16339 tested positive. The overall positivity rate comes to 18.44% (applicable for up to June 30). It needs to be noted that for a long time, the Telangana state did not publicly disclose the daily number of tests it was conducting daily that drew the ire of the High Court. Hence, the cumulative number of tests cannot be corroborated. The daily positivity rate for number of tests conducted by Telangana state on June 30 comes to 27.33%.
