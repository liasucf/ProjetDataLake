It further provided that the fact of three or more years possession could be alleged in stay of restitution, on penalty of payment of costs if that fact was not proved.This is how the statute is summarised in the two marginal notes to it in \"The Statutes\" referred to above. ==See also== Forcible Entry Act == References == *Halsbury's Statutes, Third Edition, volume 18, page 411 *The Statutes, Third Revised Edition, HMSO, 1950 Category:Acts of the Parliament of England (1485\u20131603) Category:1588 in England Category:1588 in law ",
