    "text": "Smilin' Through is a 1941 Technicolor MGM musical film based on the 1919 play of the same name by Jane Cowl and Jane Murfin. The film was a remake of a previous 1932 version by MGM and was the third and final film version of the play. It starred Jeanette MacDonald, Brian Aherne, Gene Raymond and Ian Hunter. It was filmed in Technicolor and was remade as a musical for MacDonald with several older songs interpolated into the story. ==Plot summary== The plot remained essentially the same as in the play and previous film versions. Kathleen (Jeanette MacDonald) is a young Irish woman in love with an American, Kenneth Wayne (Gene Raymond). The romance, however, is opposed by her adopted father John Carteret (Brian Aherne), who recalls the painful memory of his tragically thwarted love for Kathleen's aunt, Moonyean Clare (the roles of Kathleen and Moonyean are both played by MacDonald). ==Cast== * Jeanette MacDonald as Kathleen / Moonyean Clare * Brian Aherne as Sir John Carteret * Gene Raymond as Kenneth 'Ken' Wayne / Jeremy 'Jerry' Wayne * Ian Hunter as Reverend Owen Harding * Frances Robinson as Ellen *Patrick O'Moore as Willie * Eric Lonsdale as Charles, Kenneth's Batman * Jackie Horner as Kathleen, as a Child * David Clyde as Sexton * Frances Carson as Dowager * Ruth Rickaby as Woman ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1941 films Category:1940s romantic musical films Category:American romantic musical films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Frank Borzage Category:American films based on plays Category:American film remakes Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films produced by Frank Borzage Category:Films with screenplays by Donald Ogden Stewart Category:Films produced by Victor Saville Category:Films based on works by Jane Cowl Category:Films based on works by Jane Murfin ",
