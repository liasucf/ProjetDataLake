    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Pascual Corbat\u00f3 Chillida (1862\u20131913), known also as Jos\u00e9 Domingo Corbat\u00f3, Padre Corbat\u00f3 or Francisco Mar\u00eda Cruz, was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest. Between 1891 and 1912 he animated 7 local and short-lived Valencian periodicals. In the mid-1890s he was briefly catapulted to celebrity status when he was trialed for asserting that the regent Maria Christina was leading the Spanish freemasonry. Politically Corbat\u00f3 initially sided with Carlism and was its vehement propagandist. In the 20th century he developed his own political doctrine: Traditionalism formulated in highly providentialist and millenarian terms. In historiography his political trajectory is considered typical for some disintegration patterns within Carlism; Corbat\u00f3 himself is viewed as representative of a heterodox breed of espa\u00f1olismo. ==Family and youth== Benlloc, present view Corbat\u00f3's ancestors were probably farmers; at some point one of their representatives managed to access lower professional strata.Javier Esteve Mart\u00ed, La pol\u00edtica antiliberal en Espa\u00f1a bajo el signo del nacionalismo: el padre Corbat\u00f3 y Polo y Peyrol\u00f3n [PhD thesis Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia], Valencia 2017, p. 20 His father, Jos\u00e9 Corbat\u00f3 Card\u00e1, was related to the Levantine town of Benlloc, where in the mid-19th century he worked as a teacher in local primary school.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 21 At unspecified time he married Vicenta Chillida Planell; none of the sources consulted provides any information either on her or her family, except that they were entitled to a petty rural rent.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 20\u201321 The couple had 5 children, Jos\u00e9 born third in succession and the first male descendant. The family was very pious; already at the age of 4 Jos\u00e9 knew how to pray a rosary, some of his cousins became priests, and 3 of the Corbat\u00f3 Chillida siblings became religious themselves.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 20\u201321. Corbat\u00f3\u2019s cousin Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Corbato was also member of the Dominican order; for a few years he taught natural sciences in Universidad de Manila, El Restaurador 09.03.10, available here; his sister became an abess of the Dominican convent in Alca\u00f1iz Following the 1868 revolution Corbat\u00f3 Card\u00e1 fervently opposed the new order; he declared himself supporter of the legitimist claimant Carlos VII and refused to take oath to the constitution of 1869.Mar\u00eda Bayarri Rosell\u00f3, Las biograf\u00edas de Girolamo Savonarola en Espa\u00f1a en el siglo XX, [in:] Donald Weinstein, J\u00falia Benavent i Benavent, J.

P. y su influencia en Espa\u00f1a y Europa, Firenze 2004, , p. 226 As a result, he was not only fired from his petty teaching job, but reportedly also jailed, detained in Valencia and threatened with execution; during his incarceration the family suffered great economic hardships. Upon Corbat\u00f3 Card\u00e1's release in 1871 he was reinstated to the official job but posted some 60 km away to Zorita, in the Castell\u00f3n Maestrazgo already bordering Arag\u00f3n; the entire family settled in the town as well. Upon outbreak of the Third Carlist War Jos\u00e9 4 times escaped from home to enlist to legitimist troops, always rejected due to his age. In 1874 and posing as a 15-year-old he was eventually admitted, assigned to the garrison of Cantavieja. Shortly afterwards he was transferred to units commanded by Pascual Cucala and become POW during the battle of Miravet. For a few months he was shuttled between various prisons.the adolescent Corbat\u00f3 passed through the prisons of Tarragona, Vic, Mora d\u2019Ebre, Falset, Montju\u00efc and another Barcelona prison, Manlleu, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 22 Thanks to exchange of prisoners the boy returned to Carlist ranks, initially commanded by Francisco Savalls and then again by Cucala. He served in various unitsfirst in the 6th company of Batall\u00f3n de Vizcarro. Narrowly escaping encirclement by Liberal troops he survived the rout at Igualada and was later incorporated into Batall\u00f3n de Miret. Most details on his military career are provided by Corbat\u00f3 himself and perhaps should be approached with caution, see e.g. Luz Cat\u00f3lica 09.10.02 until Carlist troops in Catalonia surrendered in 1875.data based on his own account in La Monarqu\u00eda Federal, 27,06.98, and booklet Carlismo, Espa\u00f1olismo.

Referred after Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 23 Exact role of the boy is not clear and it is not certain whether Jos\u00e9 took part in combat or performed some auxiliary roles.information on his wartime fate is based almost exclusively on his own account In 1876 Corbat\u00f3 entered the Tortosa seminary. Following a brief spell in Dominican seminary in Belchite he then moved to the one in Corias, where he commenced novitiate and assumed the name of Jos\u00e9 Domingo.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 113 In 1880 he took simple vows and formally entered the Dominican Order,Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 113\u2013114 assigned to the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Caldas monastery.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 114 His conventual years were marked by conflicts with superiors, including altercation with the future Dominican provincial superior, Cayetano Garc\u00eda Cienfuego. In 1887 Corbat\u00f3 was moved to San Pablo convent in Palencia,Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 114-115 where he was charged with fraud and temporarily suspended.Bayarri Rosello 2004, p. 227 Shuttled between Valdeprado del R\u00edo,in the convent of Real Santuario de Montesclaros Palencia and Corias, he was also accused of indecent correspondence.his superiors claimed to have found indecent letters exchanged with his distant female relative; Corbat\u00f3 claimed the papers were falsified, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 115 In 1889 Vatican was asked for his interminable suspension.due to \"permanent incapacity to adhere to conventual rules\" Eventually Corbat\u00f3 retained his ministerial licenses and was allowed to live extraconventual life.\"licencia para permanecer fuera del claustro durante la enfermedad alegada\", Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 116 In 1890 he moved to Villareal to settle with his parents.his father has already retired and bought a house in Villareal. Corbat\u00f3 got his ministerial licenses confirmed and was saying mass in the local convent, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 116 ==Carlist propagandist== Le\u00f3n XIII, los carlistas y la monarqu\u00eda liberal Having gained experience as periodista during his conventual years,in 1889\u20131890 El Siglo Futuro advertised his El Hijo de las L\u00e1grimas, \"ensayo po\u00e9tico sobre la conversi\u00f3n de san Agust\u00edn, compuesto en treinta y tres cantos y muy variadas combinaciones m\u00e9tricas\"; it is not clear whether the poem has ever been published. In 1889 he commenced co-operation with a Dominican review Sant\u00edsimo Rosario, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 114-115 in the early 1890s Corbat\u00f3 was the moving spirit \u2013 in some cases also formally a directorthis was the case of El Valenciano and El Criterio Valenciano; in case of La Voz de Maestrazgo the director was Nemesio Traver, Jos\u00e9 Navarro Cabanes, Apuntes bibliogr\u00e1ficos de la prensa carlista, Valencia 1917, p. 184 \u2013 of a few periodicals: a Castell\u00f3n weekly La Voz de Maestrazgo (1891\u20131893), a Valencian daily El Valenciano (1893\u20131894), its continuation1894 El Valenciano merged with its local Catholic rival El Criterio El Criterio Valenciano (1894\u20131895) and a Valencian weekly La Monarqu\u00eda Federal (1895\u20131896). All operated at the verge of profitability, sustained mostly by donations; their circulation was at best nearing 3,000.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 140 All assumed extremely combative Carlist stand,some authors claim that virulent aggressive language was by no means excveption in the Levantine and Catalan press of the era, Solange Hibbs-Lisourges, La prensa cat\u00f3lica catalana de 1868 a 1900 (II), [in:] Anales de Literatura Espa\u00f1ola 9 (1993), p. 100. Corbat\u00f3 published under his own name but he used a variety of pen-names, e.g. \"Fulano de Tal\" directed not only against Liberal and Conservative groupings, but also against other Levantine Catholic periodicals;his venom was directed especially against El Criterio of Valencia, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 137 Corbat\u00f3 claimed exclusive license for orthodox Catholicism.Corbat\u00f3 claimed that almost all other peridicals were not sufficiently Catholic, and denounced their reported fidelity to Roma as false, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 140\u2013142 None was officially authorized by local Carlist structures,La Voz was not an official provincial party mouthpiece; in 1893 this role was assumed by El Tradicionalista. Corbat\u00f3 tried to intervene with the natiowide party leader de Cerralbo, but to na avail. Following brief fratricidal competition La Voz ceased to publish, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 138 though some posed to represent Traditionalist organizations.La Monarquia Federal posed as organ of Juventud Tradicionalista While attracting second-rate contributors and in few cases Levantine Carlist pundits,La Monarqu\u00eda Federal ensured sporadic co-operation of local Carlist personalities like Manuel Polo y Peyrol\u00f3n and Joaqu\u00edn Llor\u00e9ns. Other contributors listed were Jos\u00e9 Navarro Cabanes, Vicente Calatayud y Bonmat\u00ed, Juan Luis Mart\u00edn Mengod, Bernardo Pellejero P\u00e9rez, Santiago Jorcano and Francisco L\u00f3pez Solano, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 143 all periodicals remained Corbat\u00f3's one-man show and for long periods he used to populate their pages almost single-handedly.among a spate of pen-names Corbat\u00f3 signed his contributions often as \"V\u00edctor\" or \"P. de Castag\u00e9lida\" Moreover, in the mid-1890s Corbat\u00f3 turned into a genuine icon of young Valencian Carlists;Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 227. In 1896 some popular Carlist propaganda items contained his portraits along these of key nationwide party leaders like Bartolom\u00e9 Feli\u00fa or Jos\u00e9 de Li\u00f1an, El Baluarte 28.02.96, available here at home he ran an informal circulo, built his own followingEsteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 229 and started to appear as an alternative leader, differing from old-style tycoons like Llorens, Polo and Simo Mar\u00edn.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 225\u2013250 Relatively unknown beyond the Traditionalist Levantine circles, in 1894\u201395 Corbat\u00f3 was elevated to nationwide celebrity.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 285\u2013288, compare also a selection of press notes at Hemeroteca.bne service, available here It was because of his 1894 booklet Le\u00f3n XIII, los carlistas y la monarqu\u00eda liberal.Corbat\u00f3 published the book under the pen-name of M\u00e1ximo Filibero, but his identity became almost immediately known Resembling an earlier pamphlet of F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e0 y Salvany, it was a most intransigent interpretation of papal teachings and contained onslaught on liberal and conservative politics; the booklet presented Carlism as the sole depositary of CatholicismCorbat\u00f3\u2019s exaltation of the Carlist king at times assumed millenarian and biblical tones, e.g. he claimed that \"no hay salvaci\u00f3n fuera de los principios cat\u00f3licos tan dignamente representados por el Se\u00f1or D. Carlos VII de Borb\u00f3n\", referred after Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 274 and lambasted various breeds of traitors.Corbat\u00f3 directed his pen not only against the Conservatives and the Carlist offhoots known as Pidalistas, but also against the Integrists of Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 270 Le\u00f3n triggered legal action as Corbat\u00f3 alleged that the regent, Maria Christina, was heading the Spanish freemasonry. The cause turned into a scandal and was attentively followed by national press; even the prime minister Sagasta admitted to having read the pamphlet.Sagasta noted that charging a commoner with leading freemasonry by no means could have been considered an insult, but in case of a regent it certainly was, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 279 Corbat\u00f3 was expulsed from the Dominican order, the first such case ever recorded in Spain.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 282\u2013283, see also La Uni\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica 05.01.95, available here In 1896 he was sentenced to 11 years in prison and huge financial penalty.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 286 Carlist standard Evading incarceration, in early 1896 Corbat\u00f3 fled Spain. He was briefly hosted by the claimant in Venice,El Correo Espanol 25.01.96, available here yet he settled permanently in Paris; he tried to make a livingperhaps was aided by French legitimists (maybe on recommendation of Carlos VII), considered migrating to America, especially Buenos Aires and Mexico, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 292 by teaching Latin, translations,in 1899 Corbat\u00f3 translated from French: El hombre tal como debe ser by Abate V. Marchal and El consuelo de los enfermos, \u00f3 el dia santificado por la enfermedad by Henri Perreyve, Mallorca 05.01.99, available here. His translation of La Religieuse by Diderot was peculiar, as Corbat\u00f3 \"corrected\" paragraphs he considered incorrect, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 292 editing antologiesLecturas cl\u00e1sicas en prosa y verso, Paris 1899 and providing religious service.he was rumored to provide religious service in the entourage of Francisco de As\u00eds de Borb\u00f3n, who might have also supported Corbat\u00f3 financially; as Francisco was related to the Alfonsine branch, it prompted some to suspect that Corbat\u00f3 deviated from the Carlist orthodoxy Unable to manage Monarqu\u00eda remotely he decided to close it. In 1896 he published Dios, patria y rey o el catecismo del carlista;again the booklet was signed with a pen-name of M\u00e1ximo Filibero the booklet presented Carlos VII as a model Christian king, determined to fight liberal tyranny, and was sold via Carlist channels in 1896\u20131898.La Tradici\u00f3n 10.04.97, available here During the Spanish-American war he zealously engaged in various patriotic initiatives and visited the Spanish embassy offering his own design of a torpedo.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 291. Already in 1891 Corbat\u00f3 tried his hand at mechanics and allegedly devised a \"bomba hidraulica\" of unknown usage, El Criterio 01.12.91, available here, and El Criterio 17.09.92, available here Intransigent as always, he denounced the Paris 1900 Universal Exposition as triumph of socialism, Judaism and freemasonry;Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 291 even the Spanish hierarchy was not spared his venom as timid and not sufficiently committed.Jos\u00e9 Domingo Corbat\u00f3, Memorias, impresiones y pron\u00f3sticos de un espa\u00f1ol proscripto, Val\u00e8ncia 1905, pp. 253\u2013255, referred after Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 289 In 1899 Corbat\u00f3 published Los Consejos del Cardenal Sancha;full title Los Consejos del Cardenal Sancha o Apolog\u00eda Cat\u00f3lica del carlismo; the pamphlet, though utterly respectful towards the Church as such, confronted the conciliatory stand that the primate adopted versus the liberal Madrid government the booklet was aimed against the primate and affirmed that only Carlism represented the genuine Catholic stand.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 304 ==In search of new identity== Luz Cat\u00f3lica Though royal amnesty was declared in 1897 and 1898 Corbat\u00f3 was not eligible; he had to wait until 1899, when the usual Fiesta de los Reyes pardon covered also his offences.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 394 He returned to Valencia, visited relatives, tried to arrange for a Catholic college, fearing incarceration briefly travelled to Paris and definitely returned in mid-1900;Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 394\u2013395 following some confusion his ministerial license was confirmed by the Valencia archbishop.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 395 At that time his relations with official Carlism were already strained. Since the mid-1890s he was viewed by local Levantine party leaders as uncontrollable and potentially rebellious.the first conflict was related to competition between La Voz de Maestrazgo and El Tradicionalista, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 367 Apart from his political intransigence there were also issues related to personal squabblesanother one emerged over the person of Segismundo Peix Ordeix, whom Corbat\u00f3 accused (rightly, as it turned out later) of false Traditionalism. Issues related to Corbat\u00f3\u2019s stand as leader of the young generation pitted against the old one followed, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 167 and generational divisions involved, and especially Manuel Polo y Peyrol\u00f3n turned into his vehement critic. Already in Paris Corbat\u00f3 engaged in fervent Carlist insurrectionist propaganda;Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 383\u2013387 as in October 1900 the conspiracy boiled down to few isolated attempts he was profoundly disappointed by ambiguous stand of Carlos VII, and his mistrust towards the Levantine party leaders was extended also to the claimant and the national executive. Back in Spain Corbat\u00f3 \u2013 by scholars considered possessed by \"obsesiva dedicaci\u00f3n al campo de la prensa\"Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 185 \u2013 resumed labors to launch a new periodical. He obtained some donations from friends and relatives, was prepared to mortgage his Villareal house and contributed his own meager savings to launch Luz Cat\u00f3lica, a weekly which was first published in late 1900.Corbat\u00f3 possibly ensured a subsidy from the religious convent headed by his older sister; some financial contribution came from his cousin. He also intended to mortgage his house in Villareal, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 175 This time the periodical did not assume a clear party identity, sub-titled \"Semanario critico de religi\u00f3n, ciencias y espa\u00f1olismo\".Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 167 Initially the weekly might have seemed flavored with Carlism, e.g. when it questioned Traditionalist credentials of Polo y Peyrol\u00f3n,Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 374 but soon it turned decisively against the party. Posing as a genuine Traditionalist voice, Luz Cat\u00f3lica started to castigate cesarism and hypocrisy of Carlos VII and his men, including the party leader Barrio y Mi\u00e9r; they allegedly opted for rapprochement with the Restoration system. In 1903 Luz Cat\u00f3lica was revamped as La Se\u00f1al de Victoria, but its editorial line remained the same. Carlos VII Corbat\u00f3's anti-Carlist campaign climaxed with the 1904 publication of Los carlo-traidores. Memoria p\u00f3stuma del general D. Salvador Soliva. The pamphlet, written jointly with Joan Bardina but published anonymously,the authors featured were \"C. M. Apsmav y Dr. Leal\", but the identity of Bardina and Corbat\u00f3 was almost immediately established. The booklet was formatted as defense of Salvador Soliva, one of the Octubrada leaders, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 392 was an open and virulent onslaught on the claimant. Dwelling mostly upon the failed 1900 insurrection which allegedly left ardent and dedicated partisans of the cause abandoned by their leaders, the authors presented Carlos VII as traitor to the cause and to the men who trusted him, a delator, fraudster sold out to liberalism and perhaps a man financed with the Alfonsist money.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 392 The book triggered a spate of furious attacks on part of the Carlist press; the affair sealed Corbat\u00f3's break with Carlism.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 402 He embraced Traditionalism deprived of the dynastic thread, which he now ridiculed as \"Carlos, Carlos y Carlos o C\u00e9sar, C\u00e9sar y C\u00e9sar\".Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 406 At that time Corbat\u00f3 was already promoting a general alliance of all anti-Liberal political groupings. He began to relativize his earlier vehemence, e.g. against the Integrists, and opted for a broad, patriotic and Catholic formula.watering down his earlier anti- nocedalismo, now he posed as supporter of a union of all anti-liberals, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 402 ==Espa\u00f1olista== Apolog\u00eda del gran monarca In the early 1900s Corbat\u00f3 developed his own political theory. Auto-identified as espa\u00f1olismo, it was laid out in some 20 bookletsthe key ones were Carlismo y espa\u00f1olismo (1901); El espa\u00f1olismo de Aparisi Guijarro (1901); Apolog\u00eda del Gran Monarca (1903); Exposici\u00f3n a Don Carlos de Borb\u00f3n y Austria-Este sobre carlismo y espa\u00f1olismo (1904); Meditaciones religioso-pol\u00edticas de un espa\u00f1ol proscripto (1904); Memorias, impresiones y pron\u00f3sticos de un espa\u00f1ol proscripto (1905); Integrismo y espa\u00f1olismo: s\u00edntesis de la pol\u00edtica tradicionalista fundamental (1905); for a longer list see e.g. Luz Catolica 01.11.00, available here published in Valencia between 1900 and 1905;booklets were published as so-called Biblioteca Espa\u00f1olista. The series was marketed first by Luz Cat\u00f3lica and then by La Se\u00f1al de Victoria, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 395 the best known work is Apolog\u00eda del Gran Monarca.exact publication date is not clear. Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 175 dates it in 1903, but the booklet was advertised already in 1900, Luz Catolica 01.11.00, available here Corbat\u00f3's espa\u00f1olismo was a highly providentialist, millenarian doctrine which combined exalted patriotism and religious zeal. Based on assumption that the global liberal order would undoubtedly collapsemarked by a revanchist spirit, Apolog\u00eda del Gran Monarca predicted the fall Britain, conversion of Russia to Roman Catholicism, disintegration of the USA and reunion of Latin American states with Spain. It advanced also clear Iberism and envisioned a union of Spain and Portugal, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 411 it envisioned ultimate advent of a universalist monarchy.a present-day scholar locates Corbato's writings in line with earlier works anticipating a universalist monarchy by Adri\u00e9n Pelad\u00e1n, San Francisco de Paula, Juan de Vatiguerro, Joaqu\u00edn de Fiore, Marie Lataste, San Vicente Ferrer, Bug de Milhas, San Alonso Rodr\u00edguez, Nicol\u00e1s Factor and Michel de N\u00f4tre-Dame In a regenerationist tone Corbat\u00f3 hinted that the impulse might come from Spain, which would regain imperial status as a Hispanic commonwealth.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 411 He remained ambiguous as to the future monarch.among candidates to the throne Corbato considered both Don Jaime and Alfonso XIII, though he might have thought also about himself. In his booklets the thread was not explicit, but a contemporary scholar suggests that it vaguely emerged in Corbat\u00f3\u2019s private correspondence. It is supposed that Corbat\u00f3 interpreted his almost permanent series of misfortunes and failures as providential; within this mental framework, he was to resign all private and serve some grand universal goals, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 414 Scholars reconstruct his espa\u00f1olismo as \"a form of anti-liberal Spanish nationalism,initially Corbat\u00f3 saw no incompatibility between espa\u00f1olismo and catalanismo, claiming that both support each other. Later he maintained that there was no such thing as \"Catalan nation\", but remained conciliatory towards Uni\u00f3 Catalanista and Lliga Regionalista. Still later he was already firmy opposed to \"semi-separatismo\" of Catalans and Basques. His longtime friendship with Bardina ended in 1903; the latter was accused of fomenting anti-patriotic Catalanism, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 487 founded on ultramontane Catholicism and Traditionalism, with the objective of building a moderate, regionalist monarchy and corporative society\".Corbat\u00f3 envisioned a highly interventionist and protective state; in truly Traditionalist fashion he opposed division of powers, though he acknowledged that a king might delegates his juridical powers to Tribunal Supremo and could be assisted by Real Consejo, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 460 One historian sees Corbat\u00f3's espa\u00f1olismo as an attempt to modernize Traditionalism;his biographer claims that \"through a combination of imperialism, protectionism and a measure of state interventionism in social affairs, [he] sought to adapt Traditionalism to the needs of a mass society\", Javier Esteve Mart\u00ed, El tradicionalisme en l\u2019ascens del nacionalisme de masses: el pare Corbat\u00f3, [in:] Recerques. Hist\u00f2ria, Economia, Cultura 65 (2012), p. 109 another presents it rather in terms of mysticism and esoterism.William A. Christian Jr., Moving Crucifixes in Modern Spain, Princeton 2014, , p. 110 Apart from his booklets, the principal platform of advancing Corbat\u00f3's ideas were La Luz Cat\u00f3lica and La Se\u00f1al de Victoria. However, he tried also to set up own political organisation. Since 1902 he headed a Valencia-based Junta Central Cat\u00f3lico-Espa\u00f1olista; it presided over few small local c\u00edrculos.e.g. in Girona; there were circles also beyond Levante, like in the Andalusian town of Velez-Rubio He tried to operate \"Academia Espa\u00f1olista\" in Barcelona, though with some 40 members it remained almost defunct. His most successful structure was Milicia de la Cruz, founded in 1901.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 420 It adhered to a hybrid formula in-between a secular religious order, paramilitary organisationthe group practiced some military drills in Desierto de la Palmas near Valencia; few leaflets embraced violence and even killings, but the group has never embarked on any violent action and traditional c\u00edrculo; its membership is unclear, though it should probably be estimated in tens rather than hundreds. As its leader Corbat\u00f3 assumed a new name, Francisco Mar\u00eda Cruz; the militia operated thanks to minor donations and sought support of the local religious hierarchy.formally the Militia was ruled by Regla Galeata de los hermanos de la Milicia de la Cruz o forma de vida religiosa y pol\u00edtica de la nueva Orden de Cruc\u00edferos, a booklet published by Corbat\u00f3 in 1903. The Valencia archbishop explictly stated that Militia does not enjoy support of the hierarchy, La Lectura Dominical 16.02.07, available here cardenal Guisasola In 1905 Corbat\u00f3 left Valencia for the Basque Mend\u00edvil. Invited by the local entrepreneur Alfredo Ortiz de Villaci\u00e1n he was supposed to serve the community of local miners. In fact, both were consumed by a theory of immaculate conception of Saint Joseph.Corbat\u00f3 advanced his Josephine theories already in La Se\u00f1al de Victoria When in 1907 he published El Inmaculado San Jos\u00e9Vatican intervened almost immediately and the book was listed on index. Still in 1907 Corbat\u00f3 published a follow-up booklet titled Vindicaci\u00f3n Josefina; moderated in tone and posing as in line with papal teachings, it nevertheless tried to upheld the theory, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 430\u2013434 and tried to launch the cult of Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de San Jos\u00e9, the V\u00edtoria bishop prohibited him from saying mass; he was also admonished by Rome. Locally he was increasingly frequently ridiculed as a madman.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 427\u2013430 Subscribers of La Se\u00f1al started to withdraw and the daily soon collapsed.the last issue was published in 1907 He dissolved Milicia de la Cruz in 1907Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 434 and did not try to rebuilt it when returned to Valencia in 1910. Instead, he focused on a new periodical;the editorial board was to be composed of \"tradicionalistas, pero independientes de todo partido\", Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 549 preparatory works lasted until 1912, when it materialized as a bi-weekly Tradici\u00f3n y Progreso.sub-titled \"Religi\u00f3n, Patria y Autoridad\". Its first issue pledged co-operation of many widely recognized authors, like Mar\u00eda de Echarri y Mart\u00ednez, Mar\u00eda Carbonell S\u00e1nchez, Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n, Maximiliano Arboleya Mart\u00ednez, Francisco Camps, Severino Aznar Embid, Jos\u00e9 Roca y Ponsa, Alejandro Pidal y Mon, Juan V\u00e1zquez de Mella and F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e1 y Salvany. It is not clear how many indeed promised their contributions, Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 551-556 The local hierarchy viewed him as a \"dangerous man\"; Victoriano Guisasola y Men\u00e9ndez suspended his ministerial licensesEsteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 553 and denounced his writings as deviating from the orthodox Catholic teaching.\"sacerdote exreligioso, no adscrito can\u00f3nicamente a la Di\u00f3cesis\". The official archbishopal note declared also \"la prohibici\u00f3n de publicar escrito alguna en ella, trat\u00e1ndose de quien por otras publicaciones ha merecido censura desfavorable del mismo Prelado y de la Sagrada Congregaci\u00f3n del Santo Oficio\", referred after Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, p. 558 Following few issues Tradici\u00f3n closed in late 1912; at the time Corbat\u00f3 was already gravely ill and in poverty. His passing away was barely noticed in the press.one of few exceptions was the Integrist daily El Siglo Futuro, see issue of 26.05.13, available here. Another one was the Carlist El Correo Espa\u00f1ol, see issue of 24.05.13, available here Some of his disciples awaited Corbat\u00f3's resurrection for a few years to come.Esteve Mart\u00ed 2017, pp. 435\u2013436.
