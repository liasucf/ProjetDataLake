    "text": "The voiceless alveolar, dental and postalveolar plosives (or stops) are types of consonantal sounds used in almost all spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiceless dental, alveolar, and postalveolar plosives is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `t`. The voiceless dental plosive can be distinguished with the underbridge diacritic, and the postalveolar with a retraction line, , and the Extensions to the IPA have a double underline diacritic which can be used to explicitly specify an alveolar pronunciation, . The sound is a very common sound cross- linguistically; the most common consonant phonemes of the world's languages are , and . Most languages have at least a plain , and some distinguish more than one variety. Some languages without a are Hawaiian (except for Ni\u02bbihau; Hawaiian uses a voiceless velar plosive for loanwords with ), colloquial Samoan (which also lacks an ), Abau, and N\u01c1ng of South Africa. ==Features== Here are features of the voiceless alveolar stop: * There are three specific variants of : ** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively apical and laminal. ** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth. ** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively apical and laminal. == Varieties == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
