Harding's campaign slogan for the election of 1920. Although detractors of the time tried to belittle the word \"normalcy\" as a neologism as well as a malapropism, saying that it was poorly coined by Harding (as opposed to the more accepted term normality), there was contemporaneous discussion and evidence that normalcy had been listed in dictionaries as far back as 1857.\"The Mavens' Word of the Day: normalcy\", June 25, 1999, randomhouse.com. Harding's promise was to restore the United States' pre-war mentality, without the thought of war tainting the minds of the American people. To sum up his points, he stated: > America's present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but > normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; > not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not > experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in internationality, but > sustainment in triumphant nationality. ==1920 election== Harding's position attracted support and was important during the 1920 United States presidential election, which he won with 60.3% of the popular vote. During the campaign, Harding addressed the issue of the word's origin, claiming that \"normalcy\" but not \"normality\" appeared in his dictionary: > I have noticed that word caused considerable news editors to change it to > \"normality\". I have looked for \"normality\" in my dictionary and I do not > find it there. \"Normalcy\", however, I did find, and it is a good word. == 2020 Presidential Campaign of Joe Biden == Return to normalcy has also become associated with the 2020 presidential campaign of Joe Biden, specifcally because of the effects of COVID-19 on American life and the presidency of Donald Trump. Many see Joe Biden in his vice presidency under Barack Obama as normal and his becoming president as a return to normalcy. ==See also== *Creeping normalcy ==References== ==External links== *\"Normalcy\", The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, 3rd ed., edited by E.
