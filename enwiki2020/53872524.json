    "text": "Chu Ming Silveira (Shanghai, April 4, 1941 - S\u00e3o Paulo, June 18, 1997) was a Chinese-Brazilian architect and designer, creator of the Orelh\u00e3o telephone booth. ==Biography== Chu Ming Silveira was born in Shanghai to Chu Chen, a civil engineer, and Shui Young Queen. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Chu Chen, a soldier in the Nationalist Army, fled with his family to Hong Kong, and eventually S\u00e3o Paulo. She graduated from the Faculty of Architecture of the Mackenzie University in 1964, and became famous for the design of the telephone booths, popularly known as Orelhinha and Orelh\u00e3o. Icons of Brazilian design and world street furniture, the telephone booths were named by the Brazilian Telephone Company at the time of its launch, Chu I and Chu II, respectively, in honor of its creator. The point of origin of her successful project was the shape of the egg which was, in her opinion, \"the best acoustic form\". Simplicity and respect for the forces of nature also characterized her residential projects on the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo, especially in the municipality of Ilhabela, where she developed a unique style called \"Post-cai\u00e7ara\", in which she used contemporary materials and techniques in harmony with Traditional cai\u00e7ara culture. Throughout her professional career, in addition to Architecture and Design, Chu Ming devoted herself to Visual Programming. ==Personal life== Chu Ming married in 1968 with the Brazilian engineer Cl\u00f3vis Silveira. The couple's first child, Djan, was born in April 1971. Their second son, Alan, was born in October 1976. ==Death== She died on June 18, 1997, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, at the age of 56. == References == Category:1941 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Shanghai Category:Brazilian people of Chinese descent Category:Brazilian architects Category:Brazilian women architects Category:Chinese expatriates in Brazil Category:Mackenzie Presbyterian University alumni Biography: Chu Ming Silveria was born in Shanghai, China on April 4, 1941, and died in Sao Paulo, Brazil on June 18, 1997. While Silveria resided in Shanghai with her mother, Shui Young Queen, her father, Chu Chen, served as a soldier in the National Amry. Following the Communist success in the Chinese Civil War which began in 1927 and lasted through 1949, Chen flew his family to Hong Kong and eventually ended up in Sao Paulo with them (Dk & Team, 2017). While traveling at sea for more than three months, Silveria's family crossed paths from Hong Kong to Rio in 1951, where they found a home and started their new lives. Once settled in Sao Paulo, Silveria attended Mackenzie University and graduated in 1964 with a degree focused around architecture to help her pursue her interests in the design and architecture fields of study (Fesson, 2019). She was determined to become a successful female entrepreneur and innovator, and she did just that after spending several years earning a degree at Mackenzie University. The Orelh\u00e3o: Following her graduation from Mackenzie University, Silveria went on to accomplish her goals and became a female innovator. Living in Brazil allowed Silveria to understand the struggles that the citizens faced when trying to hear each other talk on the phone in public phone booths located in urban areas. Additionally, she found that these phone booths would take up a significant amount of space on the sidewalks without delivering a solution that was pleasing to the consumers, and oftentimes they would be vandalized. With 52 million of the 100 million citizens of Brazil residing in urban areas at the time, Silveria put her mind to this issue and invented the Orelh\u00e3o (Fesson, 2019). Not only did she craft a phone booth that was accessible to a majority of the residents, but she designed it in such a way that would bring forth the best acoustic form. After testing many ideas and finding which solution was the best for this pain point she found, she came up with a phone booth whose ears were formed in the shape of eggs in order to bring forth the best acoustics for Brazilians all around the country. Today, the mobile company, Oi, is the largest telecommunication provider in South America. Not only does it have 17 million loyal clients, but it represents some of the leading icons of the telecommunication industry, such as Silveria and her invention of the Orelh\u00e3o. Oi took this innovation to the next level and named the booths Chu I and Chu II based on their legacy and functions. Chu I is positioned in compact spaces such as public shops or workspaces, whereas Chu II is meant to function in outdoor spaces to provide comfort and security with the fiberglass that is incorporated in the booth to resist bad weather in the extreme temperatures that Brazil faces (Fesson, 2019). Impact on Society Today: Although much change has been made regarding technology and cell phone use since Silveria's invention of the Orelh\u00e3o in 1971, she was one of the first to innovators to introduce this design and idea to the society at large. Today, the Orelh\u00e3o has made its way to Latin American countries ranging from Peru, Columbia, and Paraguay to countries in Africa such as Angola and Mozambique along with China and other countries around the world (Green, 2016). In order to combat the struggles that the world is facing and provide a safe space for residents to talk to their loved ones, Silveria instilled a space of comfort with the small, welcoming shapes that are exclusive to the person talking in the phone booth and provide a sense of privacy for all. Silveria's legacy continues to this day, and her life accomplishments were recognized by Google Doodles on her 76th birthday (Chu Ming Silveira\u2019s 76th Birthday - Google Search, 2017).
