    "text": "Capparis spinosa subsp. nummularia, the wild passionfruit, or (locally) caperbush, is an Australian native plant. It is a subspecies of the caper adapted to deserts. Its name in the Arrernte language of Central Australia is Merne arrutnenge. Wild passionfruit is a tasty bush tucker food. When it ripens, the skin turns orange and splits open and the little black seeds become visible. It is then ready to eat. The seeds are hot and spicy when crushed. It grows prolifically in riverbanks in the desert. ==References== * Hiddins, L., Bush Tucker Field Guide, Explore Australia Publishing 2003, page 48 * Low, T., Wild Food Plants of Australia, Angus & Robertson Publishers 1991, page 173 spinosa subsp. nummularia Category:Bushfood Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plant subspecies ",
