The current principal is Sheena Millar. ==History== Onslow College opened in 1956 to serve Wellington's rapidly growing northern suburbs. The school has not had a school uniform since the 1970's when it was abolished following student protest. In 2016 Onslow was one of the first schools in the region to have gender-neutral toilets for students. Several staff have received awards for teaching excellence. Terry Burrell, received the prestigious Prime Minister\u2019s Science Teacher Prize in 2014, and the same year Esme Danielsen (Maths) received a Woolf Fisher Fellowship. On 13 February 1997, 18-year-old former student Nicholas Hawker murdered 15-year-old St Mary's College student Vanessa Woodman on the school's grounds. Woodman was strangled, had her throat slit, and was stabbed 32 times. Hawker was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 10-year non-parole period. He was released on parole in 2015, but is not allowed in the North Island. == Notable alumni == === Academia === * James Belich \u2013 Professor of History and writer * Mary Morgan-Richards \u2013 Professor of Wildlife evolution === The Arts === * Nick Bollinger \u2013 musician (Rough Justice, Windy City Strugglers), music critic and author * Anna-Lisa Christiane \u2013 Miss Earth New Zealand 2015 * Jonathan Harlen \u2013 author * Phil Knight \u2013 Shihad lead guitarist * Peter Marshall \u2013 singer (The Holidaymakers) * John McDougall \u2013 guitarist-songwriter (The Holidaymakers) * Rosemary McLeod \u2013 writer * Emily Perkins \u2013 author * Catherine Robertson \u2013 author * Jackie van Beek \u2013 film and television director, writer and actor * Taika Waititi \u2013 film director and actor.
