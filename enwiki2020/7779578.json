It was founded in 1972 with the objective of providing a professional and permanent exhibition space for women artists during a time in which the works shown at commercial galleries in New York City were almost exclusively by male artists. A.I.R. is a not-for-profit, self-underwritten arts organization, with a board of directors made up of its New York based artists. The gallery was originally located in SoHo at 97 Wooster Street, and was located on 111 Front Street in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn until 2015. In May 2015, A.I.R. Gallery moved to its current location at 155 Plymouth St, Brooklyn, NY 11201. A.I.R. is a non-profit organization that aims to show the diversity and artistic talent of women, to teach, to challenge stereotypes of female artists, and to subvert the historically male-dominated commercial gallery scene, with the overall hope to serve as an example for other artists who wish to realize their own art cooperative endeavors. == History == Founded in 1972, A.I.R. is the first non-profit, artist-run gallery for women in the country. The announcement for the gallery's first exhibition elaborates its founding concept best, stating, \u201cA.I.R. does not sell art; it changes attitudes about art by women. A.I.R. offers women artists a space to show work as innovative, transitory and free of market trends as the artists\u2019 conceptions demands.\u201d Based on the feminist principles of economic cooperation and decision by consensus, A.I.R. continues to offer an alternative venue for women that protects the creative process and the individual voice of the artist. Barbara Zucker and Susan Williams, two artists and friends, confronted the challenges of finding a dealer and decided to look for other women artists to start a co-op. Feminism at that time had barely penetrated the New York Art scene and a 1970 Whitney Museum protest drew attention to the less than 5 percent female representation. Directed by activist art critic Lucy Lippard, the two, together with Dotty Attie and Mary Grigoriadis, visited 55 studios to select and invite women artists to form a co-op. At the first meeting on March 17, 1972, in William\u2019s loft, women artists met, among them were Maude Boltz, Linda Vi Vona, Nancy Spero, Louise Bourgeois, Howardena Pindell, Ree Morton, Harmony Hammond, Cynthia Carlson and Sari Dienes. For the artists themselves, their work and exhibition goals were all about quality. Still, having to deal with feminist politics was in the center, which meant fighting prejudices and fears that the showings would be considered second-rate. After the opening, one man said grudgingly, \u201cOkay you did it; you found 20 good women artists. But that\u2019s it.\u201dCarey Lovelace, a.i.r. ways. From the Catalogue: \u201cA.I.R. Gallery: The History Show, Sept. 16 \u2013 Dec. 12, 2008 at Tracy/Barry Gallery, Bobst Library, NYU and A.I.R. Gallery: The History Show, Oct. 2 \u2013 Nov. 29, 2008 and Nov. 6 to Nov. 29, 2008 at A.I.R. Gallery, Dumbo, NY\u201d The gallery was structured to be both an exhibition space for art by women and a radical, progressive, and even subversive, not-for-profit institution. Its cooperative nature and its democratic structure have meant that the members vote on all decisions and participate in monthly meetings to plan exhibitions, programs, and the overall direction of the gallery. Each artist pays membership dues and thus has ownership over the organization itself and their own career. In this way, the structure of A.I.R. differs from that of dealer-driven galleries. Incoming artists are chosen through a rigorous peer review process that includes reviewing the works of applicants, lengthy discussions and a studio visit by current members.Kat Griefen and Susan Bee, artists in residence: a short history. From the Catalogue: \u201cA.I.R. Gallery: The History Show\u201d Each artist has to curate her own show, which allows for experimentation and risks that are not always possible in commercial settings. The group soon acknowledged the importance of building a heritage; collaborations and international group shows, in parts curated by their members, were established. The fellowship program in its earliest years provided sponsorship on a case-by-case basis as funds were available.Dena Muller, A.I.R. Gallery: a space-time continuum. From the Catalogue: \u201cA.I.R.

Gallery and Government Funding' vol.Jan 27, 2011 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal pp.29-37 == Name == The name \u201cA.I.R\u201d arose when, in a first meeting, artist member Howardena Pindell suggested \u201cJane Eyre\u201d. From that came \u201cair\u201d \u2013 then, \u201cA.I.R.\u201d This was also a reference to the \u201cArtist in Residence\u201d Certification given by the city to allow artists to live in otherwise illegal Soho commercial spaces.Carey Lovelace, a.i.r. ways. From the Catalogue: \u201cA.I.R. Gallery: The History Show\u201d == Programs == Monday-Night Program Series 1972\u20131981; Current Issue Series 1982-1987 (both programs included general- audience panels on criticism, the market, public art as well as \u2018how-to\u2019s \u2013 for example \u2018tax night\u2019, and so on); Exhibition Programs: Solo Shows of Gallery Artists; Sponsored Solo Shows for Fellowship Artists; Group Shows of National Artists; Group Shows designed to include a broader community of women artists such as the \"Generations\" invitational series and juried Biennial Exhibitions; Lectures/Symposia/Panels; Fellowship Program; Internship Program The Fellowship Program, founded in 1993, is open to all self-identified women artists who have never had a solo show in NYC, or who have not had a solo show in NYC in the last ten years, outside of an educational or not-for-profit venue. The Fellowship Program is structured to give the Fellows the opportunity to develop their work in preparation for a solo show, to build relationships with other artists and arts professionals, and acquire skills necessary to maintain a not-for-profit gallery or arts organization. The Fellows leave the program with a series of naturally forged relationships, experiences, and essential skill sets that are necessary to continue their careers as visual artists. Fellowship artists include (1993-2021): Tenesh Webber, Diyan Achjadi , Angie Eng, Debra Hampton, Juri Kim, Sheila Manion- Artz, Fay Torres Yap, Elizabeth Zechel, Enid Crow, Christine Gedeon, Marni Horwitz, Fay Ku, Diane Meyer, Jinnine Pak, Hye-Kyung Kim, Jill Parisi, Sarah Blackwelder, Pattie Lee Becker, Soyeon Cho, Betsy Alwin, Megan Biddle, Margarida Correia, Stephanie Lempert, Brynna K.

Gallery has played a widely recognized role in the art world since the institution's founding. In 1978, notable feminist painter Sylvia Sleigh commemorated the 21 current members (including Sleigh herself) of A.I.R. through her painting A.I.R. Group Portrait.Morgan, Ann Lee. \u201cSleigh, Sylvia.\u201d The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists, Oxford University Press, 2018. www.oxfordreference.com, In the essay \u201cThe Enemies of Women\u2019s Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed,\u201d Art Historian Meredith Brown praises how A.I.R. \u201ccreated a wide-ranging network of individuals and organizations that collectively rallied to counter the patriarchy of the art establishment\u201d.Shapiro, Emily D. 2012 Essay Prize: Meredith A. Brown. 8 Jan. 2012, https://www.aaa.si.edu/publications/essay-prize/2012-essay-prize- meredith-brown.01/acref-9780191807671-e-1231. Art Historian Lenore Malen similarly acknowledges the influence of A.I.R. stating \u201cNew York City where I moved in 73 I saw how the women's collectives: A.I.R., Soho 20, and others were shaping the feminist art movement\u201d.Feminism Forum. http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/04/forum.html. Accessed 17 Oct. 2018. While many acknowledge the influence of A.I.R. on feminist art, the gallery has received some criticism in its use of government funding. In her article \u201cThe Balance Sheet: A.I.R. and Government Funding, Meredith Brown argues that \u201cA.I.R. began to rely on financial support from sources whose bureaucratic complexities necessitated the gallery shift its organizational structure, if not compromise its feminist principles\u201d.Feminism Forum. http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/04/forum.html. Accessed 17 Oct. 2018. == Gallery locations == The first, self-renovated location for the inaugural A.I.R. exhibition was 97 Wooster Street, which opened on September 16, 1972.
