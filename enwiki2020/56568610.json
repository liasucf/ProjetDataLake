The producers were Nabatov and Leo Feigin. All of the nine tracks were written by Nabatov. The pianist plays \"One-handed Bandit\" with his right hand only. ==Release and reception== Perpetuum Immobile was released by Leo Records in January 2002. The Penguin Guide to Jazz wrote that \"The influences on this solo recital come from the entire modern classical canon, and quite explicitly so.\" The AllMusic reviewer wrote: \"Nabatov's solo piano work is entirely different than his ensemble recordings: Alone, he displays a strong romantic side that can be alternately dark and brooding or vigorously upbeat. His use of the pedals adds an atmospheric element that never devolves to mawkishness, but instead embraces life.\" ==Track listing== #\"Which Way Up?\" \u2013 7:21 #\"In Motion\" \u2013 5:57 #\"Chordal\" \u2013 6:16 #\"Flow Chart\" \u2013 4:57 #\"Negative Transparency\" \u2013 6:43 #\"Polymorphous Perverse\" \u2013 6:19 #\"One-handed Bandit\" \u2013 4:58 #\"U-trillo\" \u2013 8:24 #\"Positive Transparency\" \u2013 6:34 ==Personnel== *Simon Nabatov \u2013 piano ==References== Category:2002 albums Category:Leo Records live albums Category:Solo piano jazz albums ",
