The permissions include certain geolocation and app-checking code to comply with advertising network requirements in China, where jailbroken devices can be used to defraud advertisers, and advertisers may demand that their messages be geofenced to appear only in certain regions.

In June 2020, the Government of India banned Meitu app with 58 other Chinese origin apps citing data and privacy issues. The border tensions in 2020 between India and China might have also played a role in the ban. ==References== Category:Software companies established in 2008 Category:Companies established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in China Category:Companies based in Xiamen Category:Electronics companies of China Category:Mobile phone companies of China Category:Mobile phone manufacturers Category:Chinese brands Category:Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Category:Digital marketing Category:2016 initial public offerings ",
