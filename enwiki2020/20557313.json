They were competing against Danmarks Digital TV A/S (owned by Telenor) and Danmarks TV A/S (owned by Modern Times Group, MTG). The procurement was organized by the government agency Mediesekretariatet and in March 2008 chose Swedish Boxer as the gatekeeper out of the three applicants. As Telenor and MTG both owned satellite platforms in Denmark, and Boxer did not have any operations in Denmark, Boxer won the contract.Radio- og tv-n\u00e6vnets evaluering af ans\u00f8gninger om jordbaserede digitale tv-sendemuligheder, March 27, 2008 Boxer stated in their application that they would use three of the networks to broadcast 29 pay television channels and the fourth network would be used to broadcast mobile television. The initial plan was that Boxer would start broadcasting on November 1, 2009, when the analogue signals were shut down. Boxer were however able to make a soft launch on Jutland and Western Funen on February 1, 2009. The launch package, which is called \"Boxer Vest\", consists of TV 2 Zulu, TV 2 News, TV 2 Film, TV 2 Charlie, Kanal 4, Kanal 5, 6'eren, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Starting on May 1, 2009, Boxer made a soft launch in Copenhagen. This was made possible by using the Copenhagen transmitter on UHF channel 35 which was used to broadcast local channels such as Kanal K\u00f8benhavn. Boxer broadcasts the same channels as in Jutland, but shares the frequency with Kanal K\u00f8benhavn and the gaming channel G-TV. In months leading up to the full launch, Boxer announced agreement with the channels that were added in November 2009, including Discovery Travel & Living, CNN and Cartoon Network in February, Disney Channel in April, Travel Channel in May, Disney XD, Discovery Science, MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon in June, Canal 9 and Canal+ channels in July and TV 2 Sport in August. On August 17, Boxer revealed the full lineup. Other than the previously announced channels, it would include The Voice, History, Star!, Body In Balance, TV4 Sweden, TV2 Norway and Das Erste. Notably absent from the lineup were the Viasat channels (including TV3, TV3+ and TV3 Puls), Eurosport, dk4, National Geographic Channel and SVT's channels. On March 15, 2011 there was a channel change, and Body In Balance and Canal+ Sport 1 was cut from the package and replaced by DK4 which had been in great demand. Also Canal+ Hits Sport Weekend was replaced by just Canal+ Hits. 11 January 2012 there an additional another channel change took place, since the Danish TV 2 became a pay channel. today the channel is offered in all Boxer channel packets such as Boxer Mini, Boxer Mix, Boxer Max, Boxer Flex8 and the Boxer TV 2 package. from April 2012, Boxer has offered HD channels.
