Wodehouse is an English surname and barony. The baronetcy was created in 1611, the barony in 1797. Since 1866 it has been held by the Earl of Kimberley, the current Baron Wodehouse being John Wodehouse, 5th Earl of Kimberley (b. 1951). ==History== The name \"de Wodehouse\" is attested as early as in the 11th century, of one Bertram, of Wodehouse-tower, Yorkshire, who lived at the time of the Norman conquest.Joseph Horsfall Turner, Yorkshire place names, as recorded in the Yorkshire Domenday book, 1086 (1901) An elaborate pedigree of the Wodehouse family of Norfolk is on record beginning with Sir David Wodehouse (b.1053) Father of Sir Constantine de Wodehouse (b.1080) -who was married to Lady Isobel Botetourt (b.1085). John Wodehouse (died 1431) Member of Parliament for Norfolk and Suffolk, is the first of the family to be ~historically attested~ in Norfolk and arrived there as an outside administrator for the Duchy of Lancaster.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/wodehouse- john-1431 The augmented coat of arms of Wodehouose from this time has been blazoned sable a chevron or, gutte de sang, between three cinquefoils ermine with the crest on a wreath, an arm erect, holding a club in the hand and on a scroll the motto frappe forte^, i. e. \"strike strong\", and at the bottom Agincourt, supported by two wild men.Francis Blomefield, 'Thetford, chapter 25: Of the Corporation', An Essay towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk: volume 2 (1805), pp. 132-147. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=78043 The native English term for \"wild man\", woodwose (from a putative Old English *wude-w\u0101sa \"wood-being\"), has been transformed to woodhouse by popular etymology due to their appearance as supporters in the Woodhouse coat of arms.
