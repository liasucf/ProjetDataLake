    "text": "The WoodPussy is a 13\u00bd\u2019 catboat designed by Philip Rhodes. The first boats were constructed in 1945 by Palmer Scott Boat Works. These boats were wood with wooden masts. The class switched to fiberglass hulls in the early 1960s. It is estimated that 800-850 hulls were constructed by Palmer Scott, MarScott and O'Day. Today there are four fleets of WoodPussys: Monmouth Boat Club and Shrewsbury Sailing and Yacht Club, both in New Jersey. Crystal Lake Yacht Club, Frankfort, MI and NorthEast WoodPussy Association, Long Island, NY. The WoodPussy is used for both daysailing and racing. The Weeks Yacht Yard in New York is now building new fiberglass WoodPussys. ==Specifications Under Current Rules== *Number of crew 1-2 *LOA *Beam *Hull weight *Mast Height *Sail Area ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Woodpussy boat builder * Woodpussy Class Association Category:Dinghies ",
