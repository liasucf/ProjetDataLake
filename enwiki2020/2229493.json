    "text": "Ted Lewis Wilson (born May 18, 1939) is an American politician who served as the 30th mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, US, from 1976 until July 1985. He won three elections. Wilson resigned during his third term to become the director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah where he held an adjunct assistant professorship of Political Science. His terms were noted by an election in May, 1979 to change the five member commission form of government to a mayor/council form. This initiative was created by a city scandal involving the take-over of the city personnel department by the chief of police. Other highlights of Wilson's administration included re- construction of the Salt Lake City International Airport, re-building the city's sewage treatment plant, re-tooling the water system, and expanding the green space of the city's parks department. Wilson also initiated and passed the first historical and foothill preservation ordinances in the city's history. Currently, Wilson is the Executive Director of the Utah Rivers Council, a Utah-based environmental organization. == Partial biography == Ted Wilson was born May 18, 1939, in Salt Lake City, Utah.
