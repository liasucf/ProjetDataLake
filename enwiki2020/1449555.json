was on holiday. ==Personal life== Judd met his wife, former Escala violinist Brittany \"Izzy\" Johnston, when she appeared as part of the string section on McFly's 2005 concert tour. They married in 2012 and have two children together. Their first child, Lola Rose Emma, was born after they struggled to conceive with IVF, and in 2017, Kit Harry Francis Judd was born after being conceived naturally. Judd and his McFly bandmates support the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) through the Eyes Alight Appeal founded by his wife Izzy. His brother-in-law Rupert had sustained a serious traumatic brain injury as a result of a car accident in 1997 and Rupert's long recovery inspired Izzy to set up the appeal to raise funds to support BIRT's rehabilitation programmes. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1985 births Category:English drummers Category:British male drummers Category:Living people Category:People from Chelmsford Category:McFly members Category:Musicians from Essex Category:People educated at Uppingham School Category:People educated at Old Buckenham Hall School Category:Strictly Come Dancing winners Category:21st-century drummers Category:McBusted members ",
