    "text": "George Skirrow Beecroft (16 November 1809 \u2013 18 March 1869) was a British Conservative Party politician and ironmaster. ==Family== Born in 1809, Beecroft was the son of George Beecroft and Mary Audus. He first married his cousin Septima Garland Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler and Anne Beecroft in 1835. Together, they had two children. The first died in infancy, and the second, Septima, died in 1868. His wife, Septima, died in 1837. In 1842, he married to Mary Isabella Beaumont, daughter of George Beaumont. Together, they had two children: George Audus Beaumont (1844\u20131873) and Mary Alice, who died in infancy. ==Early life== Beecroft was educated for a mercantile life at Horton House, in Bradford, until he was 17. He then moved into the iron trade, working with his father and uncle, Thomas Butler (senior), at Kirkstall Forge, eventually becoming a partner. In 1841, he entered into partnership with his cousins - John Octavius Butler, Thomas Butler (junior), and Ambrose Edward Butler - at Beecroft, Butler and Co, before retiring in 1855. ==Political career== Beecroft began his career as a member of the Leeds Town Council in 1849, holding office there until 1856. Outside of this, he was also President of the Leeds Conservative Association, a surveyor of highways, a churchwarden, and an active member of the Leeds Chamber of Commerce. He was elected a Liberal-Conservative - nominally a Conservative - MP for Leeds at a by- election in 1857 - with politics supporting the Church of England, encouraging popular education, and extending the franchise - and held the seat until he stood down at the 1868 general election, owing to ill health. ==Other activities== Beecroft was also a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Deputy Lieutenants of the West Riding of Yorkshire Category:UK MPs 1857\u20131859 Category:UK MPs 1859\u20131865 Category:UK MPs 1865\u20131868 Category:1809 births Category:1869 deaths ",
