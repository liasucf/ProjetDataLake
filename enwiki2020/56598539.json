The competition was organised by South American football's governing body, CONMEBOL; other beach soccer events under the \"Copa Am\u00e9rica\" title took place during 1994\u201399, 2003 and 2012\u201314, however this incarnation is the first to be officially organised and sanctioned by CONMEBOL. The tournament was hosted by Peru in the Asia District, around 100 km south of the capital, Lima, between 3 and 10 March. The event was held in cooperation with the local organisers, the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF). The matches were watched by over 3.5 million people through the FPF's use of Facebook Live to transmit the games worldwide, to the delight of CONMEBOL who claimed the figures demonstrated beach soccer's continued growth under its investment. Brazil were the defending champions and successfully reclaimed the title, beating Paraguay in the final in what was a repeat of the concluding match in the last edition. ==Teams== Teams representing all 10 members of CONMEBOL took part. * * * * * * * * * * ==Venue== One venue was used in the Asia District, Ca\u00f1ete Province. *A purpose built arena was erected at the Sports Centre of the tourist location, El Boulevard de Asia, hosting all matches, with a capacity of 1,000. ==Squads== Each team had to submit a squad of 12 players, including a minimum of two goalkeepers (Regulations Article 4.1). ==Draw== The draw to split the ten teams into two groups of five took place on February 15 in the Asia District of Peru at the Centro Deportivo del Boulevard Asia, (Sports Centre of Boulevard Asia).
