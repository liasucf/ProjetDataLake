When Mamie has a baby daughter, Daisy May, Danny thinks he's not her father and, desperate, starts drinking. Although he thinks she is someone else's daughter, he loves little Daisy May and, when the child grows up, she will travel with him in the wagons carrying beer. During one such trip, Danny, having drunk too much, loses control of the horses. In the ensuing chaos, the little girl ends up injured. Meanwhile, Bouvais - who has continued his relationship with Mamie all those years - manages to persuade the woman to leave Danny. But the accident in which the daughter and her husband were involved, awakens love for Danny in the woman. Mamie rejects the painter who finally leaves her alone and turns her attention to another one who then marries. Happiness returns to Danny and Mamie's house. Daisy May also heals and Danny resumes work starting a new career: that of driver of milk wagons. ==Cast== :{| ! style=\"width: 180px; text-align: left;\" | Actor ! style=\"width: 230px; text-align: left;\" | Role |- style=\"text-align: left;\" |Elsie Jane Wilson||Mamie |- |Mignon Anderson||Kate |- |Harry Carter||Gaston Bouvais |- |Emory Johnson||Tommie |- |Zoe Rae||Daisy Mae |- |Nanine Wright||uncredited |- |Pomeroy Cannon||Danny |- |Burwell Hamrick||uncredited |- |} ==Cast Gallery== File:Elsie Jane Wilson 1.JPG|Elsie Jane Wilson File:Mignon Anderson Stars of the Photoplay.jpg|Mignon Anderson File:Harry Carter - The Kentucky Derby (1922).jpg|Harry Carter File:Emory Johnson 32.jpg|Emory Johnson File:My Little Boy 01.png|Zoe Rae ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Silent films Category:American films ",
