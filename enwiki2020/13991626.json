With world headquarters in Cary, North Carolina, LORD has approximately 3,100 employees in 26 countries and operates 19 manufacturing facilities and 10 R&D; centers worldwide., Lord CorporationKholos, L. (2005) Courage and Innovation: The Story of the Lord Corporation, Albrecht & Associates, As of October 30, 2019, the company has been acquired by Parker Hannifin. == History == In 1919, Hugh C. Lord, a patent attorney in Erie, Pennsylvania, began exploring the potential of bonding rubber-to-metal to isolate and control shock, noise and vibration. This led to the founding of the LORD Corporation, in addition to inventions such as chemical formulations, bonding processes, elastomers, adhesives, coatings and bonded elastomer assemblies. During the 1920s, General Electric used LORD manufactured mounts for trolley cars. Lincoln and Nash Motors automobiles also began to use LORD engine mountings. LORD was trademarked, leading to the creation of the LORD Manufacturing Company. The company's instrument panel mounts were also used by airplane manufacturers in order to lengthen service life. In the 1940s, the LORD Manufacturing Company was incorporated. The company would supply engine mounts to many aircraft manufacturers. Mountings for railroad cars and buses were manufactured and LORD produced the first ever elastomeric transmission parts and engine isolators(also known as bushings) for helicopters. Elastomeric compounds are also developed by LORD as substitutes for natural rubber for the Korean War in the 1950s. To isolate aircraft cowlings, cowl mountings and motor-nose supports were manufactured. LORD developed the outboard motor mounting for the marine industry, Chemlok adhesives, and the snubbing skirt mounting for heavy equipment installations.Courage and Innovation: the story of LORD Corporation, 1924 to 2002. Kolos, Len. Following Hugh Lord's death in 1952, his son Thomas took over the company, and continued to run it until his own death in 1989. During the 1960s -- *LORD built a facility in Saegertown, Pennsylvania to manufacture Chemlok adhesives and Chemglaze coating. *LORD Manufacturing Company changed to LORD Corporation, the Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania Plant opened for production of bonded rubber assemblies, a manufacturing plant opened in Bowling Green, Kentucky and LORD Corporation Europe was established. *LORD established LORD Industrial LTDA in Jundia\u00ed-SP, Brazil. The company created a joint venture in Zama, Japan to manufacture Chemlok, which led to the development of LORD Far East, Inc. LORD built a new corporate headquarters in Erie, Pennsylvania. *LORD designed and produced its first elastomeric damper. The gimbal ring mount and the elastomeric bearing for helicopters was developed. In the 1970s -- *LORD and Bell Helicopter designed elastomeric elements for the nodal beam pylon isolation system. *LORD established LORD Industrial LTDA in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. *LORD opened manufacturing plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky. *Fusor epoxy adhesive and Versilok acrylic adhesive trademarks were adopted. *Ultra Violet/Electronic Beam (UV/EB) cure coatings and laminating adhesive trademarks were adopted.Courage and *Innovation: the story of LORD Corporation, 1924 to 2002. Kolos, Len. Pages 57\u201395. During the 1980s -- *LORD Mechanical Products Division acquired a machining center in Dayton, Ohio. *Environmentally friendly aqueous adhesives were developed. *LORD Europe began producing industrial and aerospace products. *LORD Korea was formed to produce Chemlok., Orion Industries *LORD Aerospace Products began to develop elastomeric bearings for a Navy aircraft. *LORD de Mexico was formed. *LORD Societe Anonyme was established in France and LORD Far East relocated to Kofu, Japan. *LORD Euromech and LORD U.K. merged to become LORD Corporation Europe in the 1990s. *Liofol Company, a venture between LORD and Henkel Germany was formed. *Shanghai LORD first marketed and produced Chemlok. *Rheonetic trademark for magneto-rheological devices was adopted. *LORD moved headquarters to Cary, North Carolina. *LORD purchased Burke Palmason Chemical Company, Mavidon Corporation and Castall, Inc. *Motion Master, LORD trademark for magneto-rheological seat damping systems was adopted.Courage and Innovation: the story of LORD Corporation, 1924 to 2002. Kolos, Len. Pages 68\u2013112. In 2000, LORD Mechanical Shanghai was constructed. LORD Materials Division introduced a steer-by-wire solution for forklift trucks. BalaDyne Corporation was acquired and Active Balancing solutions for airplane propellers/rotating machinery was added to the product offering. Metal Gomma S.p.A of Monzambano, Italy was purchased, which completed 100 percent ownership by LORD., LORD Corporation Adoption of Rheonetic MR Fluids expanded into auto primary suspension systems. Company was realigned to combine Mechanical, Chemical and Material Product Divisions. The company announced a new distribution partnership with Tubelite Company Incorporated, headquartered in Apopka, Florida., LORD Corporation The first MetalJacket corrosion control coating line was established. The company was globally unified under a single brand entity. LORD acquired Henkel's rubber-to-substrate bonding and rubber coating business assets., LORD Corporation LORD teamed up with Biedermann Motech, a German manufacturer of spinal implants and prosthetic components, to produce a prosthetic device., LORD Corporation On April 29, 2019 it was announced that LORD Corporation would be acquired by Parker Hannifin for $3.675 billion. The sale was approved by the boards of each respective company and closed on October 30, 2019. More than $1 billion in proceeds from the sale were distributed to four foundations created by Thomas Lord, to benefit the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, Duke University, and the Cleveland Clinic, respectively. Each organization expects to receive approximately $260 million in unrestricted funding from the sale. ==Products== The product line today includes: Adhesives , Adhesives Magazine, February 1, 2009 Coatings, Specialty Chemicals, Electronic Materials, Vibration & Motion Control, Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids., LORD Corporation ==Technologies== *Active Vibration Control (AVC) Systems: LORD AVC systems are used to minimize vibration and reduce weight in helicopters.
