    "text": "The Mercedes-Benz OM604 is a and inline-four cylinder (R4/I4) double overhead camshaft (DOHC) diesel engine with indirect injection manufactured by Mercedes-Benz between 1993 and 1998. It replaced the single overhead camshaft (SOHC) OM601 engine. Unlike other Mercedes Benz diesels at the time that used a Bosch inline injection pump the OM604 used the Lucas electronically controlled rotary distributor injection pump (EVE) which is less reliable. The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced. It is related to the straight-5 2.5 litre OM605 and the straight-6 3.0 litre OM606 engines. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 98%;\" |- !ID!!Displacement!!Bore x stroke!!Max. power (DIN-rated)!!Max. torque!!Years!!Applications |- |OM 604.910 EVE||rowspan=4|||rowspan=4||| @ 5000 rpm||rowspan=4| @ 3100 rpm||1993\u20131998||W202 C 220 D |- |OM 604.910 EVE|| @ 5000 rpm||1996\u20131998||W202 C 220 D taxis |- |OM 604.912 EVE|| @ 5000 rpm||1995\u20131998||W210 E 220 D |- |OM 604.912 EVE|| @ 5000 rpm||1996\u20131998||W210 E 220 D taxis |- |OM 604.915 EVE||rowspan=2|||rowspan=2|||rowspan=2| @ 5000 rpm||rowspan=2| @ 2000 rpm||rowspan=2|1996\u20131998||W202 C 200 D |- |OM 604.917 EVE||W210 E 200 D |} == See also == * List of Mercedes-Benz engines OM604 Category:Diesel engines by model Category:Inline-four engines ",
