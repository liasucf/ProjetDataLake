    "text": "Al-Qastal (\"Kastel\", ) was a Palestinian village located eight kilometers west of Jerusalem named for a Crusader castle located on the hilltop. Used as a military base by the Army of the Holy War, the village was captured by the Palmach in the lead up to the Arab-Israeli War and depopulated of its residents. ==History== ===Crusader period=== A Crusader castle called Belveer or Beauverium was built there around 1168 CE. It is listed among the castles destroyed by Sultan al-Adil I in 1191\u201392 CE. No trace remains today of the castle.Pringle, 1997, p. 118: Qastal (R15): \"No trace of any Frankish structures, despite contrary claims\" Belveer is mentioned in a letter from Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, dated September 1187, in which he describes the slaughter of Christians \"by the sword of Mafumetus the Unbeliever and his evil worshipper Saladin\" and the Arab conquest of the town, which was renamed Qastal.Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th-13th Centuries, Keith Bate, Malcolm Barber, A.K. Bate ===Ottoman period=== In 1838 el-Kustul was noted as a Muslim village, part of Beni Malik area, located west of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 123Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 328 In 1863, Victor Gu\u00e9rin found modern buildings on ancient ruins. He noted that the village belonged to the Abu Ghosh clan.Gu\u00e9rin, 1868, p. 264 An Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that Kastal had a population of 10, in 5 houses; the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 156Hartmann, 1883, p. 118, also noted 5 houses In 1883, in the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine, al-Qastal was described as \"a small stone village in a conspicuous position on a rocky hill- top\" with springs to the east.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, III:18. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.310 In 1896 the population of El-kastal was estimated to be about 39 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 125 ===British Mandate period=== In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qastal had a population 43, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jerusalem, p. 14 increasing in the 1931 census to 59; 55 Muslims and 4 Christians, in a total of 14 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 32 In the 1945 statistics, the village, with a population of 90 Muslims, had a total of 42 dunums of land allocated to cereals. 169 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, including 50 dunams of olive trees.Khalidi, 1992, p.311Village Statistics, Government of Palestine. 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, pp. 58 , 103 ===1948, aftermath=== In 1948, al-Qastal was a key position on the Jaffa-Jerusalem road and was used by Arab forces to attack Jewish relief convoys so as to prevent them from reaching the besieged Jewish parts of Jerusalem.War for the Jerusalem Road, Time, Apr. 19, 1948. For this purpose it was occupied by the Army of the Holy War led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the commander of the Jerusalem Hills sector.Morris, 2008, p. 123 The village was assaulted by the Palmach's Harel Brigade and two squads of the Haganah during Operation Nachshon, after a previous minor clash had already caused most civilian inhabitants to flee.Morris, 2004, pp. 234\u2013235. Palmach troops occupied the village on April 3, but its commander was refused permission to blow up the houses. Forces under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni attacked and besieged the Haganah-held village on 7 April 1948. During the following, foggy night Al-Husayni himself was killed by a Haganah sentinel in a bizarre incident. On April 8, armed Arabs from the entire area, motivated by the disappearance of their leader, attacked and recaptured al-Qastal. However, Al-Husayni's death is said to have led to a loss of morale among his forces.Morris, 2008, p. 125 Most fighters left their positions to attend al-Husayni's funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday, April 9. Palmach troops retook the almost fully deserted village on the night of April 8-9th; they blew up most of the houses and made the hill a command post, which they managed to hold on to.Benveni\u015bt\u00ee, 2002, p. 111 Parts of the Israeli town of Mevaseret Zion are located on the former lands of Al-Qastal. ===Gallery=== File:Qastal.jpg|View of Qastal before Operation Nachshon File:Qastal ii.jpg|View of the road from Qastal File:Kastal.jpg|Palestinian irregulars moving to counterattack Haganah positions in Al-Qastal, 7\u20138 April 1948 File:Qastal iii.jpg|Approach to Qastal from the air, 1948 File:Qastal x.jpg|Harel Brigade mortar in action during battle for Qastal File:Castel fortress jerusalem.JPG|Castel fortress, 2006 ==See also== * Castel National Park * List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus * List of villages depopulated during the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Welcome To al-Qastal * al-Qastal, Zochrot * Survey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons * Al-Qastal from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center * Al-Qastal, Palestine Family.net Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War Category:Castles and fortifications of the Kingdom of Jerusalem Category:Jerusalem District ",
