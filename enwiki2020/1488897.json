The institute came to prominence under the leadership of Larry P. Arnn, who was its president from 1985 until 2000, when he became the twelfth president of Hillsdale College. The current president is Ryan Williams, who previously served as the organization's Chief Operating Officer from 2013 until being named president in September 2017. Williams succeeded Michael Pack, who served from 2015 to September 2017. The Institute\u2019s stated mission \u201cis to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life.\u201d The conservative National Review said in 2020 that \"Claremont stands out for beclowning itself with this embrace of the smarmy underside of American politics,\" although it noted that \"many conservative institutions and individuals have adjusted their standards and long-proclaimed principles to accommodate Trump and Trumpism.\" Slate magazine in 2020 called the institute \"a racist fever swamp with deep connections to the conspiratorial alt-right,\" citing as examples a 2019 fellowship granted by Claremont to Pizzagate enthusiast Jack Posobiec. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/kamala- harris-birther-birthright-citizenship-claremont.html and the publication of a 2020 \"birther\" essay by senior fellow John Eastman. The organization was an early defender of then-candidate Donald Trump; the Daily Beast stated Claremont has \"arguably has done more than any other group to build a philosophical case for Trump\u2019s brand of conservatism.\" The Institute also publishes the Claremont Review of Books, as well as other books and publications, including reprints of Jaffa's works. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the institute received between $350,000 and $1 million in federally backed small business loans from Chain Bridge Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The group stated it would allow them to retain 29 jobs. ===Staff=== * Ryan Williams (President of the Institute) * William J.
