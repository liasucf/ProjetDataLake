McNaughton Company Building (predecessor of Ball Stores) at the corner of Charles and Walnut Street. The store operated as an independent department store specializing in high quality merchandise. In 1968, Ball Stores acquired Collegienne Shops, a retail outlet on University Avenue near Ball State University. In 1978, Ball Stores opened an outlet in Muncie Mall.
