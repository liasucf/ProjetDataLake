These are: * Can-ayan Proper * Candiisan * Incalbog * Kiito * Kilap-agan * Tagalolo * Tag-ilanao * Taguican * Tigbawan * Tintinaan ==Economy== Agriculture and forestry are the major economic activities of Can-ayan.

Can-ayan connects the Upper Pulangi District to the city proper through a secondary road traversing the barangay, offering an alternative route to the Aglayan-Zamboanguita Road. ==Education== There are several public elementary schools in the area and one high school, all of which are under the administration of the Department of Education Division of Malaybalay City, Schools Division II * Can-ayan Integrated School * Candiisan Elementary School * Incalbog Elementary School * Kilap-agan Elementary School * Tag-ilanao Elementary School * Tintinaan Elementary School ==History== Can-ayan was first settled by Higaonon people; under Spanish rule, the village was incorporated into the pueblo of Oroquita del Interior. Its first recorded teniente del barrio was Dat\u00f9 Ampelino Lito. The area served as a route to Silae, where Dominican and Jesuit missionaries established their communities there. Can- ayan maintained its organization even during the American and Japanese occupation of the country. After World War II, both the national and local governments gradually provided basic services to the village up to the present. With its growing population and the sprawl of urbanization from the city proper, Can-ayan is a prospective area for development. == References == Category:Barangays of Bukidnon Category:Barangays of Malaybalay ",
