    "text": "Child Passenger Safety Week is observed the third week of September as part of Baby Safety Month in the United States. The goal of Child Passenger Safety Week is to make sure every child is in the correct child safety seat, that it's properly installed and used, and that it's registered with its manufacturer to ensure parents and caregivers receive important safety updates. Child Passenger Safety Week begins with Child Passenger Safety Technician (CPST) Appreciation Day and concludes with National Seat Check Saturday. During the week, CPSTs, child safety seat manufacturers, and nonprofit and governmental organizations share safety advice, conduct seat checks, offer community educational opportunities, and generally collaborate to reduce preventable child injury or death. ==See also== *Child safety seat *Safe Kids Worldwide *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) *Transport Canada *National Safety Council == References == Category:September observances Category:Awareness weeks in the United States Category:Road safety campaigns ",
