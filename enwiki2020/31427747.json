He explained in a 1975 newspaper interview: \"In acting you just can't predict the jobs that will come along. If you could, you could budget.\" With such income uncertainty in mind as he grew older, Lynch bought a flower shop in North Hollywood a \"few years\" before the noted interview. He began studying floriculture, taking courses in the art of floral arranging and design, and then providing flowers for local weddings, receptions, and other events. According to Lynch, his many years of experience performing on decorated sets for movies and television series proved to be a benefit to him in his new business. \"Actually,\" he observed, \"servicing a wedding is like ordering flowers for a studio set\".\"Ken Lynch: A Tough Guy...\", The Bakersfield Californian, August 24, 1975.
