    "text": "Gustav Anton von Seckendorff (20 November 1775 \u2013 1823) was a German author, actor and declaimer. ==Life== Gustav Anton Freiherr von Seckendorff was an offspring of the Gudent branch of the House of Seckendorff, which had its residence at Meuselwitz, Thuringia. Gustav Anton was born at Meuselwitz as the seventh child of Friedrich Carl von Seckendorff (1727-1799), a colonel in the service of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. His brother Adolf Christian (1767-1833), who had a military career, also became known as a writer, and his works are sometimes confused with those of Gustav Anton. After studies at the mining academy of Freiberg and the universities of Leipzig and Wittenberg, he visited the United States in 1796. During his stay in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania he married Maria Elisabeth (Betty) Lechler (1782-1858), with whom he was to have fourteen children.T\u00fctken 2005, p. 908 From Pennsylvania he reported to the Neue Teutsche Merkur on the abuse of poor German immigrants (redemptioners). After his return to Germany in 1799 he entered state service in the Electorate of Saxony, occupying various positions before he was appointed Kammerdirektor in the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1807). A difference of opinion led to his resignation after seven months. He then decided to devote himself to an artistic and scholarly career. Using the stage name Patrik Peale, between 1808 and 1812 he toured the German speaking world performing as declaimer, mime artist, actor and lecturer, earning praise as well as strong criticism. His wife Betty assisted in some of his mimic or \u2018mimoplastic\u2019 productions.Muns 2016, p. 8 In 1812 Seckendorff switched to an academic career. He obtained a doctorate in G\u00f6ttingen, where he lectured as Privatdozent, and in 1814 was appointed Professor of Philosophy and Aesthetics at the University of Brunswick (Collegium Carolinum). He resigned this post in 1821, and went to the United States to establish himself as a book seller. He died in the summer of 1823 in Alexandria, Louisiana, reputedly \u201cin poverty and misery\u201d. ==Reputation== Seckendorff is mostly remembered for his Vorlesungen \u00fcber Deklamation und Mimik (1816). Like many other declaimers and declamation theorists of the time, he believed that speech prosody is a kind of music. He attempted to demonstrate this in his stage declamation, in which he accompanied himself on the piano. Critics of his declamation style include the composer and author Johann Friedrich Reichardt and the actor and theater director August Klingemann. ==Selected works== * Otto III.: ein Trauerspiel in f\u00fcnf Aufz\u00fcgen (Torgau 1805) * Kritik der Kunst (G\u00f6ttingen 1812) * Vorlesungen \u00fcber die bildende Kunst des Alterthums und der neuern Zeit: mit Beitr\u00e4gen zur K\u00fcnstlerentwickelung (Aarau 1814) * Orsina: Trauerspiel in f\u00fcnf Aufz\u00fcgen, als Folgest\u00fcck auf Lessings Emilia Galotti (Braunschweig 1815) * Vorlesungen \u00fcber Deklamation und Mimik (Braunschweig 1816) * Grundz\u00fcge der philosophischen Politik: ein Handbuch bei Vortr\u00e4gen (Leipzig 1817) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:German writers Category:Technical University of Braunschweig faculty Category:1775 births Category:1823 deaths ",
