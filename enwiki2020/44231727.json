The CD and DVD is a live recording of a concert at Bergstadens Ziir (\"Jewel of the mountain town\" in German), a church from the 17th Century in R\u00f8ros, Norway (a 17th-Century Germany mining town). It was inspired by Norway\u2019s winter, the Blue Hour, and the mystical Northern Lights. The music were arranged by Kjetil Bjerkestrand and the musicians sharing the stage with Sissel were the Trondheim Soloists, the Nidaros Cathedral Girls Choir, and Sissel\u2019s own band. The concert featured the tenor Jos\u00e9 Carreras, which performed the Julio Iglesias/Dolly Parton-duet \"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\" with Sissel. Northern Lights reached #10 in the Billboard Classical Crossover album list. ==Track listing== ===CD=== # Hallowed Mountains # Hymn To Winter # Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring # Kopp\u00e5ngen # Sarah's Song # Your Sky # When Will My Heart Arise # Icelandic Lullaby # Ready To Go Home # Quando Sento Che Mi Ami (duet with Jose Carreras) # God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen # Going Home ===DVD=== # Hallowed Mountains # Hymn To Winter # Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring # Sarah's Song # Mitt hjerte alltid vanker # Ave Maris Stella # Like an Angel Passing Through My Room # Der er ingenting i verden s\u00e5 stille som sne # Amore Perduto Jos\u00e9 Carreras # Quando Sento Che Mi Ami (duet with Jose Carreras) # In the Bleak Midwinter # God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen # Your Sky # Ready To Go Home # Going Home Bonus Tracks: # Om kvelden # Now the Day is Over (Jeg ved en l\u00e6rkerede) == References == *www.sissel.net *www.discogs.com *www.rockipedia.no Category:Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8 albums Category:2007 live albums ",
