    "text": "\"The Official Historian on Shirley Jean Berrell\" is a song recorded American country music group The Statler Brothers. The song was released in November 1978 as the third and final single from their album Entertainers... On and Off the Record. ==Content== Written by group members Don Reid and Harold Reid, the song is an uptempo recollection on various details in the life of the eponymous Shirley Jean Berrell, a woman whom the narrator knows. At the end of the song, the narrator then reveals the one detail that he does not know about her: \"where she is right now\". ==Critical reception== Cashbox published a positive review of the song, which stated that \"This song...is tailor made for the group. The foursome lightheartedly carry a listener down memory lane again and their vocal harmonizing never sounded better.\" ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1978-1979) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|7 |} ==References== Category:1978 songs Category:1978 singles Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Jerry Kennedy Category:Songs written by Don Reid (singer) Category:Songs written by Harold Reid Category:The Statler Brothers songs ",
