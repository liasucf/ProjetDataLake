    "text": "The Mojo 6 was a professional golf tournament contested by 16 amateur and professional golfers. It took place for the first time in April 2010 at the Cinnamon Hill Golf Course at Rose Hill in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The tournament was sanctioned by the LPGA but was an unofficial event. It was not part of the regular LPGA Tour, money earned by any players who are LPGA Tour members did not count on the official LPGA money list and no statistics were recorded for LPGA statistical purposes. Players included a selection of LPGA Tour members, an amateur sponsor's exemption and a 16th player selected by a public online vote. ==Format== The Mojo 6 was played using a new format called \"Raceway Golf.\" ===Day One=== Each golfer played three separate six-hole matches to accumulate points and establish a ranking from 1 to 6. The players select their opponents for the first match based on their world rankings. Each hole was worth one point and each match victory was worth one bonus point for a maximum of seven points per match. Players were then re-ranked and the highest ranked player chose her opponent first, followed by the next highest-ranked player, until eight matches were created. A third set of matches was played using the same format. At the end of the day, the top eight players with the most points moved on to play on Day Two. Players chose their opponents for the first match on Day One based on their 2009 Women's World Golf Rankings position. Ranking on Day Two were based on results from Day Two. ===Day Two=== Day Two was also known as Championship Day. The eight remaining players competed in a tournament bracket single elimination format. The player ranked number 1 played number 8. The player ranked number 2 played number 7. Number 3 played number 6 and number 4 played number 5. The field was cut to four players after the first round and to two remaining players after the third round. ==2010 Players== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" |- !Player !Country !Status !2009 Rolex Ranking1 |- | Suzann Pettersen || ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 3 |- | Cristie Kerr || ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 4 |- | Yani Tseng|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 5 |- | Anna Nordqvist|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 7 |- | Angela Stanford|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 9 |- | Na Yeon Choi|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 12 |- | Song-Hee Kim|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 14 |- | Sophie Gustafson|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 18 |- | Kristy McPherson|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 21 |- | Morgan Pressel|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 23 |- | Brittany Lang || ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 26 |- | Brittany Lincicome || ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 30 |- | Christina Kim|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 49 |- | Amanda Blumenherst|| ||LPGA Tour Member/Tournament Invitee|| 150 |- | Mariah Stackhouse || ||Amateur/Sponsor Exemption|| n/a2 |- | Beatriz Recari || ||LPGA Tour Member/Fan Voted|| 175 |- |} 1As of December 29, 2009 2Unranked amateur ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year||Dates||Champion||Runner-up||Tournament Location||Purse||Winner's Share |- |2010|| Apr 15-16 || Anna Nordqvist|| Amanda Blumenherst|| Cinnamon Hill Golf Course ||$1,000,000 || $350,000 |} ==References== ==External links== *Official site *LPGA official microsite Category:Former LPGA Tour events Category:Unofficial money golf tournaments Category:Golf tournaments in Jamaica ",
