(\"They shall not pass\") issued during the Battle for Madrid in November 1936. She joined the Spanish Communist Party () when it was founded in 1920. In the 1930s she became a writer for the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) publication Mundo Obrero and in February 1936 was elected to the Cortes Generales as a PCE deputy for Asturias. Going into exile from Spain towards the end of the Civil War in 1939, she became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, a position she held from 1942 to 1960. The Party then named her honorary president of the PCE, a post she held for the rest of her life. Upon her return to Spain in 1977 she was re-elected as a deputy to the Cortes for the same region she had represented from 1936 to 1939 under the Spanish Second Republic. ==Biography== Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri was born to a Basque miner and a Castillian mother. She grew up in Gallarta, but later moved to Somorrostro (Biscay). Gallarta was next to a large siderite mine which became the second-most important in Europe in the 1970s and which shut down permanently in 1993.Gallarta (Bodovalle) . Vintage and modern photograph of the town. 2004: Eusko Jaurlaritza \u2013 Gobierno Vasco. Ib\u00e1rruri left school at fifteen after spending two years preparing for teacher's college at the encouragement of the schoolmistress. Her parents could not afford further education, so she went to work as a seamstress and later as a housemaid. She became a waitress in the town of Arboleda, the most important urban nucleus in the region of Somorrostro.La Arboleda/Zugaztieta (Valle de Tr\u00e1paga/Trapagaran). Bizkaia.net. There she met Juli\u00e1n Ruiz Gabi\u00f1a, union activist and founder of Socialist Youth of Somorrostro. They married in late 1915, two years after the birth of their first child.Fallece Juli\u00e1n Ruiz, marido de \"La Pasionaria\". La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola. August 5, 1977, p. 10. The young couple participated in the general strike of 1917 and Ruiz returned to jail. During this time, Ib\u00e1rruri spent nights reading the works of Karl Marx and others found in the library of the Socialist Workers' Centre in Somorrostro.Irene Falc\u00f3n, personal secretary. .

The article came out during Holy Week and focused on religious hypocrisy, at odds with the Passion of Christ. Because of the article's theme and its timing, she signed it with the alias \"Pasionaria.\"Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri. . COPE Radio program Protagonistas.

In 1920 Ib\u00e1rruri and the Workers' Centre joined the budding Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and she was named a member of the Provincial Committee of the Basque Communist Party. After ten years of grassroots militancy, she was appointed to the Central Committee of the PCE in 1930.Lorenzo Pe\u00f1a: \"Nota Biogr\u00e1fica de La Pasionaria. Espa\u00f1a Roja.

Madrid, October 9, 2006. ===In Madrid (1931\u201336)=== With the advent of the Second Republic in 1931, Ib\u00e1rruri moved to Madrid. She became the editor of the PCE newspaper Mundo Obrero. She was arrested for the first time in September 1931. Jailed with common offenders, she persuaded them to begin a hunger strike to obtain freedom for political detainees. Following a second arrest in March 1932, she led other inmates in singing \"The Internationale\" in the visiting room. She encouraged them to turn down poorly paid menial labour in the prison yard.Enrico Galavotti: \"Storia della Spagna \u2013 La Pasionaria.\" HomoLaicus. September 3, 2005. She wrote two articles from jail, one published by PCE periodical Frente Rojo and the other by Mundo Obrero. On March 17, 1932, she was elected to the Central Committee of the PCE at the 4th Congress held in Seville.Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a. Spanish Wikipedia.

In November she travelled to Moscow as a delegate of the 13th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), which weighed the danger posed by Fascism and the threat of war.The Communist International (1919\u20131943). Early American Marxism: A repository of source material (1864\u20131946). The sight of the Russian capital thrilled Ib\u00e1rruri. \"To me, who saw it through the eyes of the soul\", she wrote in her autobiography, \"it was the most wonderful city on earth. The construction of socialism was being managed from it. In it were taking shape the earthly dreams of freedom of generations of slaves, outcasts, serfs, proletarians. From it one could take in and perceive the march of humanity toward communism.\"Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, Mar\u00eda Carmen Garc\u00eda-Nieto Par\u00eds, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Capell\u00edn Corrada. El \u00fanico camino. Madrid: Editorial Castalia, 1992. She did not return to Spain until the new year. In 1934 she attended the First Worldwide Meeting of Women against War and Fascism () in Paris. Although the meeting was chaired by Gabrielle Duch\u00eane, president of the French branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the separate Rassemblement was an organ of the short-lived French Popular Front;Laura Branciforte: \"La solidaridad internacional bajo el lema del antifascismo.\" both Rassemblement and the Front dissolved in 1939. Toward the end of 1934, Ib\u00e1rruri and two others spearheaded a risky rescue mission to the mining region of Asturias to bring more than a hundred starving children to Madrid. The parents of these children had been jailed following the failed October Revolution suppressed by General Franco at the behest of the Republican government. She succeeded, but she was detained briefly in the prisons of Sama de Langre and Oviedo.Peregrina Gonz\u00e1lez, former member of Mujeres Antifascistas. . Radio Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. 1995, minutes 05:45 to 06:43. To spare her children further anguish, she sent them to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1935. In 1935 she secretly crossed the Spanish border and went to the 7th World Congress of the Communist International held July 25\u2013August 21 in Moscow. At this Congress, Georgi Dimitrov delivered a keynote speech in which he proposed an alliance with \"progressive bourgeois\" governments against the fascists.entry: Popular Front. Encyclopedia of Marxism. Marxists Internet Archive. Under this doctrine, the Popular Front came to power in France in June 1936, suppressed the revolutionary fervour of the Communist masses and withheld aid from the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. The Non- Intervention Pact, which sealed the fate of the Republic, was introduced by L\u00e9on Blum, president of the French Popular Front, and signed on August 2, 1936, by France, Britain, Russia, Germany and Italy.Jacob Wedemeyer: \"A Desperate Democracy Disregarded .\" Flag.Blackened.net. Ib\u00e1rruri welcomed Dimitrov's speech as vindication of the PCE's long-standing position and returned home \"full of enthusiasm, determined to do the impossible to achieve a consensus among the various workers' and democratic organizations of our country.\". At the same venue she was elected deputy member of the ECCI and became the second Communist figure in Spain after Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, the secretary- general of the PCE.Cover of Mundo Obrero commemorating the 30th anniversary of the foundation of the PCE . Archivo Hist\u00f3rico del PCE. Biblioteca Hist\u00f3rica Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, Madrid. In 1936 she was jailed for the fourth time after enduring gross abuse from the arresting officers in Madrid. Upon her release, she hurried to Asturias to campaign for the PCE in the general elections of February 16. In these elections, 323,310 ballots were cast. However, \"one ballot, one vote\" did not rule. Each voter could choose up to 13 candidates simultaneously. The PCE received 170,497 votes, enough to seat one member of Parliament, Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri.Historic summary of Members of the Congress (1810\u20131977). Documentary Services. Madrid: Congreso de los Diputados.

In the months before the Spanish Civil War, she joined the strikers of Cadavio mine in Asturias and stood beside poor tenants evicted in a suburb of Madrid. Around this time, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, La Pasionaria and friends were chatting and sharing a coffee in a Madrid cafeteria when Lorca, who had been studying Ib\u00e1rruri's appearance, told her, \"Dolores, you are a woman of grief, of sorrows...I'm going to write you a poem.\"Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri. Me faltaba Espa\u00f1a, 1939\u20131977. Barcelona: Editorial Planeta, 1984. The poet returned to Granada and met his death at the hands of the Insurgents before completing the task. ===Civil War (1936\u201339)=== Ib\u00e1rruri offered a string of speeches, some of them radio broadcasts from Madrid: \"Danger! To arms!\" (July 19), \"Our fighters must lack for nothing!\" (July 24), \"Discipline, composure, vigilance!\" (July 29), \"Restrain the hand of the foreign meddlers!\" (July 30), \"Fascism shall not pass!\" (August 24), \"Better to die standing up than to live kneeling down!\" (September 3), \"A salute to our militiawomen on the front line\" (September 4), \"Our battle cry has been heard by the whole world\" (September 15).Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri. Documents. Marxists Internet Archive. It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied to the side of the Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Insurgents propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, \"You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock. And in this fighting some of our finest and bravest comrades have perished.\"Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri. Letter to her son. Marxists Internet Archive. She recounted that she had spent many days beside the troops at the front, and reveals her misgivings about the outcome of the war, \"It is my hope that in spite of all the difficulties, particularly the lack of weapons, we shall still win.\" The war became particularly brutal in 1937. Just as the Blitz later drove the Allies to bomb German cities mercilessly, so the Insurgents bombardment of open cities spurred Ib\u00e1rruri (speaking as the fourth, newly named vice president of Congress) to demand an equal response from the \"progressive bourgeois\" government. President Manuel Aza\u00f1a was an intellectual and a writer unwilling to flout constitutional or international laws. Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero was a socialist who was reluctant to cooperate with the PCE. The closing lines of that speech signalled her readiness to endorse radical violence, On February 24, Stalin forbade Soviet volunteers to be sent to fight in Spain,Efem\u00e9rides 1937 en la historia del mundo . Hispanopolis. but he did not recall Order of Lenin awardee Alexander Orlov of the NKVD (secret police). Orlov and the NKVD orchestrated May Days, the war that broke out between May 3\u20138 in Barcelona between the Popular Front and the Trotskyist Workers Party of Marxist Unification (POUM).How the NKVD framed the POUM. What Next? Marxist Discussion Journal. The battle left some 1,000 fighters dead and 1,500 injured, though estimates vary.Juli\u00e1n Gorkin, 2002: \"Las Jornadas de Mayo en Barcelona .\" Fundaci\u00f3n Andreu Nin.Informaci\u00f3n Obrera, 2007: \"Las Jornadas revolucionarias de mayo de 1937 . Marxismo en red. With the annihilation of the POUM, Stalin deprived the fugitive Leon Trotsky of a possible Spanish haven. Orlov used the same methods of terror, duplicity and deception that were employed in the Great Purge (1936\u201338). As a result of the May 3\u20138 events in Barcelona, the Trotskyists and the Anarchists became, in Ib\u00e1rruri's mind, the \"Fascist enemy within.\" > When we point out the need of opposing Trotskyism we discover a very strange > phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense in the ranks of certain > organizations and among certain circles in certain parties.

Marxists Internet Archive. Ib\u00e1rruri ascribed the events to an \"anarchotrotskyist\" attempt at shutting down the Republican government on orders from Franco, acting in tandem with Adolf Hitler. She said the violence was the culmination of an anarchist plot that included plans to stop the movement of trains and cut all telegraph and telephone lines. She cited an \"order [from the Catalan government] to its forces to control the telephone building and disarm all people whom they encounter in the streets without proper authorization\" as the aim of the anarchist plan. However, she provided no evidence to support these claims, which were widely held by fellow Party members at the time but have since been discredited. The Communist party alleged that the anarchist \"putsch\" was motivated by their resentment of the centralized military command sought by the Communists and their allies in Llu\u00eds Companys's Catalan government and their desire to seize political power. The anarchists and Trotskyists saw the events as an attempt by the Communist Party (in close contact with the Stalinist NKVD) to rule over all revolutionary activity and blamed the Communists for authoritarianism. They contrasted the Communists' police state to the egalitarian conditions that obtained prior to the May 1937 events. Ib\u00e1rruri, D\u00edaz and the rest of the PCE set out to destroy the Trotskyites. The remnants of the POUM leadership were put on trial in Barcelona on October 11, 1938.Wilebaldo Solano, 1999: \"El proceso al POUM: En Barcelona no fu\u00e9 como en Mosc\u00fa .\" Fundaci\u00f3n Andreu Nin.Submitted by David in Atlanta, 2007: \"International Volunteers in the POUM Militias.\" LibCom.org. Referring to the arraignments, Ib\u00e1rruri said: \"If there is an adage which says that in normal times it is preferable to acquit a hundred guilty ones than to punish a single innocent one, when the life of a people is in danger it is better to convict a hundred innocent ones than to acquit a single guilty one\"Biograf\u00eda: La Pasionaria.

Her arrival came as a surprise to the authorities, who hurriedly put her aboard a liner bound for Marseille.No es grata la presencia en Francia de Negr\u00edn, Alvarez del Vayo y \"Pasionaria\". ABC. March 11, 1939, p. 5. The ship's captain was an Insurgent sympathizer, but a clandestine Communist cell aboard ship made sure that he did not steer the ship toward Insurgent-held Barcelona. This was the third time that Ib\u00e1rruri had evaded capture by the Insurgents. She was helped in France by the Communists, who sheltered her in Paris under police surveillance (the Communist Party would be outlawed by the government of \u00c9douard Daladier on September 26). From Paris she travelled to Moscow and stayed there with D\u00edaz, generals Enrique L\u00edster and Juan Modesto and others. She was reunited with Amaya and Rub\u00e9n, who had escaped from a French internment camp at the end of the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union received the refugees warmly. Ib\u00e1rruri was given an apartment in D\u00edaz's building. She was assigned a chauffeur to drive her around Moscow and she was invited to dine at the Dimitrovs'. She liked to attend the Bolshoi Theatre and the Romen Theatre. She was an avid reader. She delighted in seeing the emancipation of Russian women.Elisabetta Rossi: \"The Emancipation of Women in Russia before and after the Russian Revolution\". In defence of Marxism. March 8, 2004. She helped other families adapt to their new country and overall she felt happy enough to sing on occasion. Ib\u00e1rruri worked in the Executive Committee of the Communist International Secretariat at the Communist International Headquarters near the Kremlin. The work involved the continual evaluation, analysis and discussion of the progress of Communism outside the Soviet Union. This task was complemented by internal discussions in the PCE central committee which focused on Spain. No serious disagreement existed between the Communist Party of Spain and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until 1968 over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The PCE supported/excused Stalin's domestic and foreign policies, including the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact on August 24, 1939. In January 1940, La Pasionaria wrote the following praise of Joseph Stalin. Ib\u00e1rruri was asked to manage a new short-wave radio station that broadcast news, analysis and opinion to the citizens of Francoist Spain. The Moscow station carried the official name of Radio Espa\u00f1a Independiente, but in Spain it was nicknamed \"La Pirenaica\" partly on the false belief that it was located in the Pyrenees and partly because the radio itself used the label occasionally.Una emisi\u00f3n de nuestras ondas volantes. Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Sonoro del PCE , 1959, seconds 1 to 16. Radio Espa\u00f1a Independiente started to broadcast on July 22, 1941, one month after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Initial broadcasts were made from candle-lit basements under sporadic aerial bombardment. Ib\u00e1rruri related that seniors, women and children kept watch on the terraces of Moscow every night for the burning sticks of incendiaries scattered by the Luftwaffe. Civilians would pick up the blazing sticks with a pair of tongs and dunk them in pails of water. Many Spanish refugees volunteered to fight alongside the Russians despite Stalin's initial disapproval. According to Ib\u00e1rruri, more than 200 died in battle. On July 18, 1941, she greeted the Spanish 4th Special Unit assigned to the defence of the Kremlin. Elsewhere, from Crimea to Finland, the Spanish Communist volunteers fought as guerrillas deployed behind enemy lines, in the Red Army or with the Soviet air force; some made it to Berlin and at least one scouted territory held by the Spanish Insurgent Blue Division. On October 13, 1941, martial law was declared in Moscow as the German 3rd Panzer Army came within of the capital. On October 16 the ECCI was evacuated by train from Moscow to Ufa the capital of Republic of Bashkortostan. D\u00edaz was gravely ill and went south to Tbilisi the capital of the Georgian Soviet socialist Republic. Radio Espa\u00f1a Independiente now broadcast from Ufa. She used various aliases such as Antonio de Guevara or Juan de Guernica presumably to make believe the station had an extensive network of commentators and newspapermen. On March 19, 1942, D\u00edaz committed suicide. La Pasionaria became secretary-general of the PCE after a brief period of consultations by Stalin. On September 3 Ib\u00e1rruri's son Rub\u00e9n Ruiz Ib\u00e1rruri lost his life fighting heroically at Stalingrad.Ibarruri Ruben Ruiz (Hero of the Soviet Union).

Asteroid 2423 Ibarruri is named after him. On March 1, 1943 Stalin created the Union of Polish Patriots and on May 15 the ECCI annulled the Third International and granted theoretical independence to every national Communist party.Efem\u00e9rides 1943 en la historia del mundo. Hispanopolis. Ib\u00e1rruri agreed with the decision. On February 23, 1945, La Pasionaria left Moscow on a trip to Tehran, Baghdad and Cairo. In Cairo she and her party booked passage on the first passenger ship to leave Alexandria, understanding it was going to Marseille. In fact the ship, part of a British convoy, headed to Boulogne-sur- Mer near the Belgian border; the voyage lasted three months and she arrived in Paris too late to meet with Juan Negr\u00edn, the last president of the Spanish Republic to work out a common political strategy against Franco. On December 5\u20138 the PCE held a plenum of the central committee in Toulouse where Santiago Carrillo, the former leader of Unified Socialist Youth in pre-war Spain, who had arrived in liberated France in November 1944, \"gained control of the PCE\", according to fellow Communist Enrique L\u00edster.Enrique L\u00edster. As\u00ed destruy\u00f3 Carrillo el PCE. Barcelona: Editorial Planeta, 1983. In his book As\u00ed destruy\u00f3 Carrillo el PCE L\u00edster criticized Ib\u00e1rruri's conduct between 1939 and 1945, writing: The persecution of dissidents inside the PCE increased with time, Interrogations were cruel, \"Carrillo and Anton inflicted true terror. Some comrades came to the brink of insanity during the rounds of interrogation and others were driven to suicide out of the despicable accusations made against them.\" The book names party members betrayed or murdered: Juanchu de Portugalete (1944), Gabriel Le\u00f3n Trilla (1945; \"the decision to eliminate Trilla belongs to Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri\"), Jesus Hernandez (1946), Lino (1950), Joan Comorera (1954), Monzon, Qui\u00f1ones, Luis Montero, Jose el Valenciano. Even generals Modesto and L\u00edster himself were at one point in the crosshairs of the PCE leadership, only to be saved inadvertently by Stalin who praised them before Ib\u00e1rruri, Carrillo and Anton.Colectivo de Analisis politico Potemkin: \"Apuntes sobre la Pasionaria y la destrucci\u00f3n del Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a.\" kaosenlared.net. August 27, 2008. The PCE persecuted Communists in northwestern Spain during those years. In 2008 Victor Garcia found the body of his father partially buried in a wooded area of O Deza (Pontevedra). He had been shot in the head. Garcia's father had not fled Spain after the defeat of 1939; he stayed behind and helped to organize a guerrilla force of 947 fighters in Galicia. Around the year 1944 the central committee of the PCE, then living in France and headed by Ib\u00e1rruri and Carrillo ordered his execution. After it was carried out in 1948, the regional PCE liaison wrote, \"At last we have hunted him down. This riffraff withstood us like a leech. We managed to catch him in Lalin from where he directed certain adventurous, uncontrolled groups. He is a provocateur who has given us many troubles; though belatedly we have eliminated him.\"R.

Arthur Dooley (1929\u201394). Works in Glasgow. Glasgow \u2013 City of Sculpture. who was commissioned in 1974 by the International Brigade Association of Scotland to create a monument commemorating the 2,100 British volunteers of the International Brigade, ordinary men and women who joined the republican forces in the Spanish Civil War in their fight against Franco's regime. The monument's inscription is dedicated to the 534 volunteers who died in the conflict, 65 of them from Glasgow, which is where the monument is situated. The statue was funded by money raised by Trade Unionists and Labour movement supporters. However, the \u00a33000 raised was insufficient to cover the artist's plans for the statue to be cast in bronze. Instead, an armature was welded together from scrap iron and covered in fibreglass. The final version of the monument is a stylised female figure, representing Dolores Ibarruri, in a long dress, standing with legs apart and arms raised. On the plinth, Dooley carved Dolores' famous slogan \u2013 'better to die on your feet than live forever on your knees'. The phrase was first used by the Mexican revolutionary leader, Emiliano Zapata, but Ibarruri gave it new meaning when she used it during the miners strike in Asturias, Spain, in 1934. Over time, the B listed statue fell into extremely poor condition and this generated criticism from the public, elected officials and trades unionists. A restoration project was carried out between April and August 2010 and the monument was re-dedicated on 23 August 2010 by Leader of the Council, Bailie Gordon Matheson, and General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Grahame Smith, in the presence of Thomas Watters, 97, a surviving International Brigade veteran. Watters was a veteran of the Scottish Ambulance Unit, which worked at the front line on the battlefields of Spain to aid wounded fighters and volunteers from across the world. In February 2017 the People's Party of the Basque Country called for a street named after her to be renamed because of her \u201cterrible role in the Spanish Civil War\u201d and her close association to Stalin. == In popular culture == Brazilian punk rock band Blind Pigs included an English language song about Ib\u00e1burri in their 2002 album \"Blind Pigs\". In Anthony Powell's novel Casanova's Chinese Restaurant, Norah and Eleanor have a picture of La Pasionaria on their mantelpiece. In Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, El Sordo's unit debate La Pasonaria's motive for sending her son to the Soviet Union away from the Spanish Civil War while under attack from pro- Franco forces.
