    "text": "The Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP), organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), is one of the most prestigious single-track academic conferences on operating systems.http://www.thegibson.org/blog/archives/27 SOSP is held every other year, alternating with the conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI). The first SOSP was held in 1967. It is sponsored by the ACM's Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (SIGOPS). == History == The inaugural conference was held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on 1\u20134 October, 1967. There were fifteen papers in total, of which three presentations were in the Computer Networks and Communications session. Larry Roberts presented his plan for the ARPANET, which at that point was based on Wesley Clark's proposal for a message switching network. Jack Dennis from MIT discussed the merits of a more general data communications network. Roger Scantlebury, a member of Donald Davies' team from the UK National Physical Laboratory, presented their research on packet switching for data communications and mentioned the work of Paul Baran. After the meeting, Scantlebury suggested packet switching for use in the ARPANET and persuaded Roberts that the economics were favourable to message switching. The ARPA team enthusiastically received the idea and Roberts incorporated it into the ARPANET design. The first conference held outside the USA was in Saint-Malo, France in 1997. In total, six conferences out of 27 have been held outside the USA. Other countries to have hosted the conference are Canada, the UK, Portugal and China. == List of conferences == The conferences are held every two years, beginning in 1967, when the first SOSP conference took place in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. {| class=\"wikitable\" |No |Year |Dates |Location |- |1 |1967 |Oct 1-4 |Gatlinburg, TN USA |- |2 |1969 |Oct 20-22 |Princeton, NJ USA |- |3 |1971 |Oct 18-20 |Palo Alto, CA USA |- |4 |1973 |Oct 15-17 |Yorktown Heights, NY USA |- |5 |1975 |Nov 19-21 |Austin, TX USA |- |6 |1977 |Nov 16-18 |West Lafayette, IN USA |- |7 |1979 |Dec 10-12 |Pacific Grove, CA USA |- |8 |1981 |Dec 14-16 |Pacific Grove, CA USA |- |9 |1983 |Oct 10-13 |Bretton Woods, NH USA |- |10 |1985 |Dec 1-4 |Orcas Island, WA USA |- |11 |1987 |Nov 8-11 |Austin, TX USA |- |12 |1989 |Dec 3-6 |Litchfield Park, AZ USA |- |13 |1991 |Oct 13-16 |Pacific Grove, CA USA |- |14 |1993 |Dec 5-8 |Asheville, NC USA |- |15 |1995 |Dec 3-6 |Copper Mountain Resort, CO USA |- |16 |1997 |Oct 5-8 |Saint-Malo, France |- |17 |1999 |Dec 12-15 |Kiawah Island Resort, SC USA |- |18 |2001 |Oct 21-24 |Chateau Lake Louise, Banff, Canada |- |19 |2003 |Oct 19-22 |Bolton Landing, NY USA |- |20 |2005 |Oct 23-26 |Brighton, UK |- |21 |2007 |Oct 14-17 |Stevenson, WA USA |- |22 |2009 |Oct 11-14 |Big Sky, MT USA |- |23 |2011 |Oct 23-26 |Cascais, Portugal |- |24 |2013 |Nov 3-6 |Farmington, PA USA |- |25 |2015 |Oct 4-7 |Monterey, CA USA |- |26 |2017 |Oct 28-31 |Shanghai, China |- |27 |2019 |Oct 27-30 |Huntsville, Ontario, Canada |} == See also == * List of computer science conferences == References == == External links == * http://sosp.org/ *https://dl.acm.org/conference/sosp Category:Computer science conferences Category:Association for Computing Machinery conferences ",
