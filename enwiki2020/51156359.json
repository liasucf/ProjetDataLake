    "text": "Cezar Papacostea Cezar Papacostea (1886-July 6, 1936) was a Romanian classicist and translator. He was born in Malovi\u0161ta (Molovi\u0219te), a village in the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet that today forms part of North Macedonia's Bitola Municipality. His Aromanian parents were Gu\u0219u (Papacostea- Goga) and Teofana (n\u00e9e Tonu), both schoolteachers. The family was deeply cultured, and his brothers pursued distinguished careers: Alexandru became a professor of political economy at Cern\u0103u\u021bi University, Petre was a jurist who held important administrative offices and Victor became a historian and professor of Balkan studies at the University of Bucharest. After emigrating to the Romanian Old Kingdom as a child, Papacostea attended primary and high school in Br\u0103ila from 1892 to 1906. From that point until 1910, he studied at the literature and philosophy faculty in Bucharest; Iuliu Valaori was one of his professors. After graduation, he became a professor of Latin and Greek at the central seminary in Bucharest. He obtained a doctorate in 1922, with a dissertation about tradition and thought in Greek literature; one of the thesis committee members was Nicolae Iorga. In 1923, Papacostea was hired as professor of Greek language and literature at the University of Ia\u0219i. His students included Petre P. Negulescu, Orest Tafrali, Dionisie M. Pippidi and N. I. Herescu. He introduced the Erasmic pronunciation of Greek into the Romanian education system. In 1926, together with Valaori and Dimitrie Evolceanu, he founded Orpheus, a magazine of classical studies. In 1929, this merged with Favonius, a magazine founded by Herescu, resulting in Revista clasic\u0103, with Papacostea numbering among the editors. During Alexandru Averescu's time as Prime Minister in the 1920s, he represented Dorohoi in the Assembly of Deputies. At the time, he belonged to Averescu's People's Party, as did his close friend, \u0218tefan Zeletin. Shortly after the latter's death, Papacostea authored the first book-length study of his life and works.C. D. Zeletin, \u0218tefan Zeletin: contribu\u021bii documentare, p. 193.
