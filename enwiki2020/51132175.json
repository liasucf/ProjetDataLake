He was murdered by Turks and therefore celebrated by Eastern Orthodox Church as Hieromartyr. His feast day is celebrated on December 13. ==Metropolitan== Gavrilo was born around 1605\u20131610 in the region of Stari Vlah into a noble Raji\u0107 family. He entered into the church service and became Metropolitan of Smederevo. In 1643, he was elected Metropolitan of Ra\u0161ka. Around 1644, He rebuilt the Monastery of the Holy Archangels in the Kovilje Mountains. After the death of Serbian Patriarch Pajsije on November 3/13 1647, Gavrilo was elected new patriarch in 1648. ==Patriarch== In 1653, he decided to travel to Russia to ask for material support for Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107. After meeting with Metropolitan Arsenije of Herzegovina on Christmas Eve, he went first to Wallachia and arrived in Trgovi\u0161te where he tried to reconcile the Wallachian Prince Matei Basarab with the Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky. From there, Patriarch Gavrilo traveled to Russia in 1654, taking with him two books for printing: Lives of Serbian Emperors and Patriarchs and Typikon against Latin Heresy of Saint Nil Kabasilas. He was welcomed by Russian Patriarch Nikon and Russian Tsar Michael Romanov. He also participated in the famous Moscow Synod in 1658 which approved Nikon's reforms. Since he decided to stay in Russia, he wrote to Serbian metropolitans to elect a new patriarch. Soon after, he changed his mind and left Russia arriving back to Ottoman Empire in 1659. Upon return, he was accused by the Turks of being responsible for the Russo-Turkish War. he was also accused of attempting to convert some Turks to Christianity. Brought before the tribunal, he was ordered to embrace Islam. After Gavrilo refused, he was sentenced to death. He was executed in Bursa on July 18, 1659. Presbyter Pavle took his remains and buried them. He was entered on the list of Serbian saints. ==See also== * List of Serbian saints ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Olga Zirojevi\u0107, Srbija pod turskom vla\u0161\u0107u 1459\u20131804, Belgrade 2007 ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Gavrilo I Category:1659 deaths Category:17th-century Serbian people Category:Serbian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church Category:Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire Category:Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians ",
