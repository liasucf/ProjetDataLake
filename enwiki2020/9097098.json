He also studied at the University of Padua.Paul F. Grendler, The Universities of the Italian Renaissance, JHU Press (2002), page 37. At the age of eighteen he spent some time in the household of the Englishman William Grey, later Lord High Treasurer, who was travelling in Italy and was a student of Guarino.Denys Hay, Renaissance Essays, Continuum International Publishing (1998), page 194. He transcribed texts for Grey and accompanied him to Rome when he moved there.Joseph Burney Trapp, \"The humanist book\", in Lotte Hellinga, Joseph Burney Trapp, The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Cambridge University Press (1999), page 297. He was a secretary of Cardinal Basilius Bessarion in 1447, and wrote a biography of him in 1472.Herbert Jaumann, Handbuch Gelehrtenkultur der fr\u00fchen Neuzeit, Walter de Gruyter (2004), page 501. From 1451 to 1453 he taught rhetoric and poetry at the University of Bologna.Paul F. Grendler, The Universities of the Italian Renaissance, JHU Press (2002), page 217. In 1452 he was made Poet Laureate in Bologna by the Emperor Frederick III, as acknowledgment of the speech of welcome he had composed. In 1455 he became secretary to Pope Callixtus III. In 1456 he was ordained, and from 1458 he was Archbishop of Siponto. Occasionally he officiated also as papal governor in Viterbo (1464\u201369), Spoleto (1471-2) and Perugia (1474\u201377).Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, (University of Toronto Press, 2003), page 68; Herbert Jaumann, Handbuch Gelehrtenkultur der fr\u00fchen Neuzeit, Walter de Gruyter (2004), page 501. He also travelled on diplomatic missions to Naples and Germany.Egmont Lee, Sixtus IV and men of letters (Ed. di Storia e Letteratura, 1970), page 88. On behalf of Pope Nicholas V he translated Polybius' Roman History for which the Pope paid him five hundred ducats. He wrote a Latin school grammar, Rudimenta Grammatices (printed by Pannartz and Sweynheim in 1473), one of the earliest and most popular Renaissance Latin grammars, which attempted to exclude many words and constructions of medieval, rather than classical, origin. Described by Erasmus as 'accurate, yet not pedantic',Kristian Jensen, The humanist reform of Latin and Latin teaching', in Jill Kraye, The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism, page 68. it became a bestseller of its day, going through 117 printings and selling 59,000 copies in Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the Low Countries by the end of the century; a further 12,000 copies of Bernardus Perger's adaptation of the work, Grammatica Nova, were also sold.Michael Milway, 'Forgotten Best-Sellers from the Dawn of the Reformation', in Robert James Bast, Heiko Augustinus Oberman, Andrew Colin Gow, Continuity and Change: The Harvest of Late Medieval and Reformation History, Brill Publishing (2000), page 135. With Pomponio Leto, he produced a version of the poet Martial's Epigrammaton in the 1470s. A book on Martial, Cornu Copiae - part commentary, part dictionary - which was completed by Perotti in 1478 and printed after his death, in 1489, was another bestseller.Robin Raybould, An Introduction to the Symbolic Literature of the Renaissance, Trafford Publishing (2005), page 157. One commentator calls it \"a massive encyclopedia of the classical world. Every verse, indeed every word of Martial's text was a hook on which Perotti hung a densely woven tissue of linguistic, historical and cultural knowledge\".Brian W. Ogilvie, The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe, University of Chicago Press (2006), page 118. It was dedicated to the condottiere Federico III da Montefeltro. He was also something of a controversialist and openly criticized Domizio Calderini for his work on Martial. He was involved in Lorenzo Valla's dispute with the writer Poggio Bracciolini, and in 1453 he sent an assassin to murder Poggio, then Chancellor of Florence. When the attempt failed and the Florentine government protested, he was forced by Bessarion, his employer, to write an apology to Poggio.John Monfasani, George of Trebizond: A Biography and a Study of His Rhetoric and Logic, Brill Publishing, 1976, page 122. Perotti was so incensed by the number of errors in Giovanni Andrea Bussi's printed edition of Pliny's Natural History that the wrote to the Pope asking him to set up a board of learned correctors (such as himself) who would scrutinise every text before it could be printed.Martin Davies, \"Humanism in script and print in the fifteenth century\", in Jill Kraye, The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism, page 57. This has been described as the first call for censorship of the press.John Monfasani, \"The First Call for Press Censorship: Niccol Perotti, Giovanni Andrea Bussi, Antonio Moreto and the Editing of Pliny's Natural History\", Renaissance Quarterly, 41 (1988):1-31. He himself was later accused by another scholar of introducing 275 serious errors in the text when he produced his own version of the work.Anthony Grafton, 'Conflict and Harmony in the Collegium Gellianum' in Holford-Strevens and Vardi, The Worlds of Aulus Gellius, Oxford University Press (2004), page 335; Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe, Cambridge University Press 2005, page 351. A collection of fables by Phaedrus, not known from any other source, was discovered by Perotti in a manuscript which is now lost. Perotti's version has been preserved in the Vatican Library and is known as \"Perotti's Appendix\".Laura Gibbs (ed), Aesop's Fables, Oxford University Press (2002), Introduction page xxi. Together with the Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, he collected books for the Papal library. He died in Sassoferrato in 1480.Ronnie H.
