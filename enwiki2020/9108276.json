The practice is one of The Five Kakaars, the outward symbols ordered by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 as a means to profess the Sikh faith. The hair is combed twice daily with a kanga, another of the five Ks, and tied into a simple knot known as a joora or rishi knot. This knot of hair is usually held in place with the kanga and covered by a turban. The 52 commands of Guru Gobind Singh written at Hazur Sahib at Nanded in the state of Maharashtra, mention that the kesh (hair) should be revered as the form of the Satguru (eternal guru) whom they consider as the same as god. For this reason by practitioners they are kept with the utmost respect. This includes regular maintenance of hair which includes but is not limited to combing at least twice daily, washing regularly and not allowing for public touching. ==Significance== Kesh is a symbol of devotion to God, reminding Sikhs that they should obey the will of God. Bhai Nand Lal, who was a well respected poet in the court of the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, wrote in Persian : > Nish\u0101n-e-Sikh\u012b ast \u012bn Panj harf-e k\u0101f, Hargiz na b\u0101shad az\u012bn panj mu\u0101f, > Kara, Karad, Kacha, Kanga bid\u0101n, Bina kesh h\u0113ch ast jumla nish\u0101n. [These five letters of K are emblems of Sikhism. These five are most incumbent; Steel bangle, big knife, shorts and a comb; Without unshorn hair the other four are of no significance.] By not cutting hair, Sikhs honour God's gift of hair. Kesh combined with the combing of hair using a kangha shows respect for God and all of his gifts. So important is Kesh that during the persecution of Sikhs under the Mughal Empire, followers were willing to face death rather than shave or cut their hair to disguise themselves. The people are devout; not cutting their hair is/has been an emblem of their goodwill. ==Modern trend== A Sikh boy wearing a patka In modern times the trend of short hair has encroached upon this tradition. It is estimated that half of India's Sikh men have abandoned the turban and cut their hair. Reasons include simple convenience (avoiding the daily combing and tying), because their parents cut their hair and they decided to get their hair cut as well, and social pressure from the mainstream culture to adjust their appearance to fit the norm.Young Men Get Haircuts, Annoying Their Elders.
