This small agricultural valley is mainly served by the route 209 which passes on the south shore and by the rang-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire Nord road which passes on a segment of the north shore. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The Noire River has its source at the confluence of Brandy Creek (coming from the west) and another stream (coming from the South).
