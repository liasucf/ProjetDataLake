Duine (born 1975) is a professor of theoretical physicsInstitute For Theoretical Physics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a part- time professor at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. He wrote his PhD thesis under the supervision of Henk Stoof, working on ultracold atoms. He has authored and co-authored more than 100arxiv.org papers on spintronics, ultracold atoms, and condensation in dissipative systems like photons, magnons, and excitons. In 2019, Duine received a prestigious NWO Vici grant of 1.5 Million Euros.Vici grant for Rembert Duine Besides other notable achievements, landmark publications by Duine and his collaborators have led to the opening of new sub-fields of physics, such as magnetic skyrmion spintronics,Spin Transfer Torques in MnSi at Ultralow Current Densities antiferromagnetic spintronics,Theory of spin torques and giant magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic metals and cold-atom spintronics.Spins in cold atoms\u2014what a drag! ==References== Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch physicists Category:Utrecht University faculty Category:Theoretical physicists Category:Utrecht University alumni Category:People from Graafstroom ",
