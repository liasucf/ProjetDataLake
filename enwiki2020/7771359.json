Built to resemble a French ch\u00e2teau, its 105 rooms on five floors occupy nearly . It shares the grounds at 1600 Rockland Road with the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, and both are owned by the Nemours Foundation. ==Origin== Nemours was created by Alfred I. du Pont in 1909\u201310 as a gift for his second wife, Alicia. It was named for the north- central French town of Nemours, which was affiliated with his great-great- grandfather, Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings designed the mansion, which is in the Louis XVI style of French architecture. ==Furnishings in the mansion== Bust located at the mansion The house contains rare 18th-century French furniture and an eclectic collection of notable antiques, works of art and tapestries. Artworks range from 16th-century religious works to paintings by the European masters to early works by Americans Frederic Remington and Sidney Lawrence. Of particular interest is a rare Louis XVI musical clock, circa 1785, by David Roentgen and Peter Kinzing, which plays four tunes on a dulcimer and pipe organ. Another clock at the mansion with a connection to French royalty is one made for Marie Antoinette, which she never received. The mansion also has a chair from the 1937 coronation of King George VI, an event which was attended by Alfred I. du Pont's third wife Jessie, and a chair from Independence Hall. Alfred I. du Pont's own portrait is also in the mansion. ==Landscape gardens== Boxwood Garden Sunken Garden The estate has the most developed and largest jardin \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise (French formal garden)-style landscape park and collection of individual gardens in North America. The design is patterned after the gardens of Versailles surrounding the Petit Trianon at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. Their central axis extends \u2153 of a mile from the mansion facade, paralleling the main avenue leading to the house. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with plantings, fountains, pools, a carillon tower, statuary, and a pavilion surrounded by naturalized woodlands. :The named features include: * The Boxwood Garden \u2013 French parterre garden with boxwood edging and a central faun fountain. * The Colonnade (1926) \u2013 memorial to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and his son Eleuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont, designed by Thomas Hastings. * The Maze Garden \u2013 a maze garden with main hedges of Western Arborvitae 'Spring Grove', inner hedges of Japanese Barberry 'Crimson Pygmy', and central statue of Achievement, by Henri Crenier, atop a base with images of Triton and Neptune's face. * The Reflecting Pool (1 acre) \u2013 in diameter, with 157 jets, backed by Japanese cryptomeria, pink flowering horse chestnut, and pin oaks. * The Sunken Gardens \u2013 designed by Alfred Victor du Pont and Gabriel Mass\u00e9na. Features large lake, grottoes, and 1930 statue by Charles-Marie Sarrabezolles (1888\u20131971). A. V. du Pont (1900\u20131970) was the only son of the owner and an architect trained at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. * The Temple of Love \u2013 in classical style, with life-sized statue of Diana (1780) by Jean-Antoine Houdon. ==Restoration and renovation== Temple of Love The Nemours mansion and gardens reopened its gates on May 1, 2008, after closing in 2005 for a 3-year, $39 million renovation. The work, commissioned by the Nemours Foundation, was performed by world-class conservators, artisans and craftspeople who refurbished furniture, fabrics, tapestries, interior finishes, paintings, and sculptures. The comprehensive reconstruction included replacing the entire electrical system, draining and repairing the 800,000-gallon reflecting pool, and landscape restoration of the extensive formal gardens plantings, constructed design elements, and statuary. ==Litigation== In June 2012, the state of Delaware filed suit against the duPont Trust and Nemours Foundation, claiming the trustees were not following duPont's intentions, Delaware was not receiving their proper yearly distribution, and the $72 million renovation should not have been included in Delaware\u2019s share of foundation distributions. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden also objected to the Nemours Mansion and Garden prohibiting access by children under 12 and limiting total visitors to 48 per tour on the 222-acre property. == See also == * Buildings inspired by Versailles * DuPont Hagley Museum and Library * DuPont Longwood Gardens * DuPont Winterthur Museum and Gardens * Landscape design history * List of botanical gardens in the United States * List of museums in Delaware ==References== ==External links== *Nemours Mansion and Gardens *Brandywine 10 * * Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:Historic house museums in Delaware Category:Buildings and structures in Wilmington, Delaware Category:Du Pont family residences Category:Brandywine Museums & Gardens Alliance Category:Museums in Wilmington, Delaware Category:Rococo architecture Category:Baroque gardens Category:Landscape design history of the United States Category:Houses in New Castle County, Delaware Category:Alfred I. du Pont Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Delaware Category:Gardens in Delaware Category:Carr\u00e8re and Hastings buildings ",
