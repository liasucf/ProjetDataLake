    "text": "The European Boxing Confederation (EUBC) is the European governing body in amateur boxing. It is a member of the world governing body AIBA. It came into existence on the adoption of its constitution on February 16, 2009, taking over the functions of the former European Amateur Boxing Association (EABA). The current president of the EUBC is Franco Falcinelli (former president of Italian Boxing Federation-Federazione Pugilistica Italiana). There are 2 vice- presidents and 16 executive committee members, all of whom are male, although the Confederation controls amateur boxing of both sexes. On 29 October 2007, the executive committee of EABA removed former president Eduard Khusainov (Russia), a sworn enemy of AIBA president Wu Ching-kuo from its association in an extraordinary EC meeting held in Chicago. The vote was 14 for, and one against for the removal of Khusainov after the Russia Boxing Federation had notified the EABA and AIBA early in October of its decision to withdraw its support for him. ==Events== * European Amateur Boxing Championships * European Union Amateur Boxing Championships ==External links== * * EUBC Constitution * Letter to the AIBA * Khusainov Category:Amateur boxing organizations Category:National members of the International Boxing Association (amateur) Category:Boxing in Europe ",
