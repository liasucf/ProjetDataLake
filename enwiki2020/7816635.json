(1970). Owners Manual (1 ed.). Mack== The Mack F series truck uses taper-leaf front springs, which helps to provide a smoother ride. Taper-lead springs practically eliminate the inter-leaf friction, which is common with multi-leaf spring systems. The taper concept uses springs of equal length and different contour, to assure the springs do not slide against one another while in normal operation. This arrangement, accompanied by forged aluminum rear brackets and shackles equate to a comfortable ride. *Front axles rated to .
