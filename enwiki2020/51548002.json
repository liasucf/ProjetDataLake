    "text": "The 1949 Oregon State Beavers football team represented Oregon State University in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) during the 1949 college football season. In their first season under head coach Kip Taylor, the Beavers compiled a 7\u20133 record (5\u20133 against PCC opponents), finished in fifth place in the PCC, and outscored their opponents, 232 to 188. The team played its home games at Bell Field in Corvallis, Oregon. In April 1949, Kip Taylor was hired as Oregon's State's head football coach, following the resignation earlier in the year of longtime coach Lon Stiner. Taylor was a native of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who played football for Michigan in the 1920s. At the time of his hiring, Taylor told the press: \"I'm a Michigan man and I like the Michigan system. We'll have the single wingback, in all probability, with my own variations.\" ==Schedule== ==Roster== *HB Ken Carpenter, Sr. ==References== Category:Oregon State Beavers football seasons Oregon State Beavers ",
