    "text": "Clayton Wood is the training ground and academy of Stoke City. ==Development== In January 2009, Stoke City unveiled plans to redevelop their training ground at an initial cost of \u00a35 million. Stoke City were given planning permission by the Stoke-on-Trent City Council to construct the facility in May 2009; Stoke had previously been renting the site from the Michelin Tyre company. The facility was designed by AFL architects who had previously designed Chelsea's Cobham Training Centre and Everton's Finch Farm. The centre was built in time for the start of the 2010\u201311 season. In April 2012, Stoke announced \u00a36 million expansions plans in order to meet the category one criteria in the Elite Player Performance Plan. In November 2015, further plans were announced to expand the facility. ==References== Category:Stoke City F.C. Category:Sport in Stoke-on-Trent Clayton Wood ",
