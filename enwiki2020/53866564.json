    "text": "Burleson Bells at the University of Texas at Austin The Burleson Bells at the University of Texas at Austin are located in a monument just outside the Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas. The Burleson bells were donated to the University of Texas at Austin as part of an anonymous gift by Albert Sidney Burleson. They are the original bells from the University Tower. The plaque outside the new bell site says the bells were retired from their original home to the new site in 1981. ==References== *Burleson Bells At The University of Texas at Austin.
