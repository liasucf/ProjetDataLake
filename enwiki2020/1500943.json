He reached the semifinals of the 2004 US Open, won 3 singles titles and achieved a career-high singles ranking of World No. 9 in February 2005. ==Background== Johansson was born in Lund and currently lives in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden. His father, Leif Johansson, was also a tennis player and represented Sweden in the Davis Cup in the 1970s. He goes by the nickname \"Pim Pim\", which he has been called since he was a newborn. His elder brother pronounced Joachim as \"Joapim\" which later became \"Pim Pim\". In 2005, Swedish hurdler Jenny Kallur became his girlfriend but in August 2008 they separated.ITF Profile Lleyton Hewitt's sister, Jaslyn Hewitt, was his girlfriend for five years from 2000 to 2005. He is married to Johanna Westerberg, a Swedish professional golfer on the Ladies European Tour, and they have one child. He is not related to fellow Swedish tennis player Thomas Johansson. ==Tennis career== ===2000\u20132003=== Johansson competed in his first professional tour match in the 2000 Wideyes Swedish Open, where he retired against Markus Hipfl. He then claimed his first win in a Challenger event in Sweden, defeating Alexander Peya. He then competed in the 2000 Scania Stockholm Open losing to Bohdan Ulihrach. In 2001 Johansson focused on Challengers and only competed in one ATP tour tournament: the 2001 Stockholm Open, losing to Andreas Vinciguerra. He however reached two Futures semifinals, in Great Britain and New Zealand, and two finals in Germany and Austria. He won his first Futures tournament in Australia, defeating Todd Perry. In 2002 Johansson won three Futures events: in Poland, in Austria, and Sweden, and reached a final in Poland. He also won his first ATP Tour level match in his home tournament in the 2002 Stockholm Open, defeating Albert Portas before losing to Fabrice Santoro. In 2003 Johansson made his Grand Slam Debut in the 2003 Australian Open losing to American Mardy Fish. He then represented Sweden against Australia in the Davis Cup, however he lost to Wayne Arthurs. He then competed in Newport losing to Zack Fleishman. In his US Open debut he once again lost to Mardy Fish. He competed once again for the fourth straight year in the 2003 Stockholm Open where he reached his first quarterfinals where he defeated his first top 30 opponent, world no. 25 Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez in the second round before losing to Davide Sanguinetti. He won two Challengers and reached two finals that year. ===2004=== 2004 was the breakthrough year for Johansson. In his first tournament in the 2004 Adidas International, he got his first win over a top 10 player in Rainer Sch\u00fcttler world no. 6 by that time before losing to Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment. He followed it up with his first Grand Slam win in the 2004 Australian Open defeating Alexander Popp and Alberto Mart\u00edn before losing to then world no. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero in four sets. He subsequently competed in 2004 Siebel Open where he lost to eventual champion Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals. Johansson continued his good form by winning his first ATP title in the 2004 Kroger St. Jude defeating en route James Blake, Mardy Fish and German Nicolas Kiefer in the finals. However his good run was disrupted winning only two matches in his next seven tournaments defeating Mark Philippoussis and compatriot Robin S\u00f6derling.

He then reached his first Masters series quarterfinal at the 2004 Canada Masters losing to compatriot Thomas Johansson. His biggest career win would come at the 2004 U.S. Open when he caused a huge upset by defeating defending champion Andy Roddick in five sets in the quarterfinals.

As a wildcard, he defeated Davide Sanguinetti in the first round, and stunned top seed and world number two Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the second round. In that match, Johansson fired 17 aces, and announced his return to the top of the game, calling it his \"greatest win ever.\" Johansson made it to the semifinals of the tournament before losing to fifth-seeded Jarkko Nieminen in three sets. In his next tournament, the Madrid Masters, Johansson pulled off another upset in the second round, defeating fifth-seeded Nikolay Davydenko in three sets.

He was given a wild card to compete in the 2008 Stockholm Open. He stamped his return by beating Nicolas Mahut in the first round before losing to David Nalbandian in the second round. In 2009, he competed in the Challengers events reaching the semifinals in Izmir, Turkey before withdrawing against Andrea Stoppini. He then got a wildcard entry at the Malaysian Open and made a surprise win over Lleyton Hewitt in the first round before losing to Richard Gasquet. Next, he competed in the 2009 If Stockholm Open after receiving a wildcard. He defeated Peter Luczak and Juan M\u00f3naco but then lost to Thomaz Bellucci. In 2010, Johansson played his first match of 2010 in singles during the 2010 Davis Cup tie against Argentina, which he lost in four sets to Argentine Leonardo Mayer. He received a wildcard at a Challenger Tour at the 2011 Internazionali di Tennis di Bergamo Trofeo Trismoka. He played in the Davis Cup against Russia.

He defeated Alejandro Falla in the first round of the main draw, before losing to Milos Raonic. ==Records== He held the record for most aces served in one match as he aced Andre Agassi 51 times in the 4th round of the 2005 Australian Open (though he still lost the match in four sets). In the post-match press conference, Johansson said he felt he could have served better.TENNIS: Agassi survives ordeal by aces as Johansson serves record 51Post-match interview Ivo Karlovi\u0107 equalled the record on 21 June 2005 at Wimbledon against Daniele Bracciali, and at the 2009 French Open, Karlovic broke the record with 55 aces against Lleyton Hewitt in the first round but lost in five sets.
