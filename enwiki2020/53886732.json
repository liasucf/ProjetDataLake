The LED turn signals that attach to the ends of bike handlebars with the aim to increase visibility on busy roads. The founders of CYCL realized that hand signals for turning are simply not sufficient; often going unnoticed. They are activated by one tap to turn them on and one tap to turn them off. The CYCL team has worked on the design, creating a product that is: * Completely made of aluminium * Waterproof * Shockproof * Qualitative and slick In December 2014, the company launch their WingLights on kickstarter. The campaign was successfully funded, collecting \u00a317,000 from over 600 backers. The startup has won a lot of awards since his birth: * the Best Business Idea (\u00a35,000 prize) and Best Pitch award (\u00a31,000 prize) at King's College's Lion's Den Challenge. * the Santander Entrepreneurship Award 2nd Place Postgraduate Category (\u00a310,000). Since October 2014, CYCL has been a part of the Sirius Programme from UK Trade and Investment, selected from over 2,200 applicants for only 50 spots.
