He has appeared on various television shows but most notably on Pinoy Big Brother. ==Early life== Dasovich was born in California, United States to a Croatian- Irish father, merchant mariner Steve Dasovich, and a Filipino mother, interior designer Charry Dasovich. Dasovich was raised in Novato, California just north of San Francisco. He has an older sister named Haley Lising Dasovich, who is also a vlogger. Dasovich is a nephew of ABS-CBN news presenter Karen Davila. He attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California with Dylan Efron, Zac Efron's little Brother. There he studied business and was accepted into an entrepreneurial internship program. In his third year of college, he started his own residential painting business, operating it for nearly two years. ==Career== ===Modeling=== After graduating from college in 2013, Dasovich travelled around Asia for three months. When he came to the Philippines, he decided to stay to learn its language and culture after his growing fondness for his Filipino roots. In an interview, he said: During the same year, while having lunch at Greenbelt in Makati, he was discovered and offered a job as a commercial model. For the next two years he appeared in several advertisements in both print and video. He would eventually make his way to local television. After being exposed to showbiz, and finding some success as a host and TV personality, he decided to remain in the Philippines and pursue his career in the entertainment industry. He eventually fully committed to YouTube focusing all his efforts on creating content. The first video he posted is called 10 Hours of Walking in Manila. ===YouTube=== Dasovich gained recognition when his videos with his father, Steve Dasovich, speaking Swardspeak or \"bekinese\" went viral. He often features different aspects of Filipino culture, which he discovers during his travels around the country. ====Work with Janina Vela==== In 2016, Dasovich and fellow YouTuber Janina Vela were the two fastest growing vloggers in the Philippines. He and Vela became brand endorsers for Jollibee. They performed together at the 2016 YouTube FanFest in Manila. The pair has produced several collaborative videos mostly of food reviews and interviews with one another. ====Vlogging group==== Dasovich started a vlogging group called the \"#VlogSquad\" (not to be confused with David Dobrik's The Vlog Squad) with fellow YouTubers Daniel Marsh and his sister Haley Dasovich. The three have appeared together in numerous travel vlogs on their respective YouTube channels. As a group they have been endorsers of many large companies including Coca-Cola, Converse, Jollibee, Forever 21 and many other notable brands. The Vlog Squad is managed by producer and YouTuber (PaperBugTV) Jako de Leon. Over time, Dasovich introduced vlogging to many other influencers and TV personalities including fellow Big Brother housemate Baninay Bautista, who became a later addition to the squad. Also part of the team is Elvin Mendoza who is the VlogSquad's IT person in charge of all the technical tasks and uploading behind-the-scene videos of the team. The squad, featuring Dasovich, Haley, and Daniel, appear in an international ad campaign for Coca-Cola. ===Big Brother=== Dasovich became a contestant on the thirteenth season of Pinoy Big Brother after a successful third audition. He had previously attempted to enter the show, but failed to make the cut twice. During his residence in the Big Brother house, he was nominated for every eviction night but survived by succeeding at save challenges or getting the highest number of text votes. He was evicted after being nominated for the fifth time after garnering the second-lowest text votes. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size: 95%;\" width=\"100%\" |- ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nomination Night November 20, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Eviction Night November 26, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nomination Night December 4, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Eviction Night December 8, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nomination Night December 17, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Eviction Night December 18, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nomination Night December 26, 2016 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Eviction Night \u2013 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nomination Night January 1, 2017 ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Eviction Night January 2, 2017 |- | style=\"background:#959FFD;\" | Nominated | style=\"background:#73FB76\" | Saved by winning save challenge | style=\"background:#959FFD;\" | Nominated | style=\"background:#73FB76\" | Saved by winning save challenge | style=\"background:#959FFD;\" | Nominated | style=\"background:#73FB76\" | Saved by text votes | style=\"background:#959FFD;\" | Nominated | style=\"background:#CCC;\" | No eviction | style=\"background:#959FFD;\" | Nominated | style=\"background:#FA8072\" | EVICTED by text votes |} ==Personal life== In August 2017, upon returning to San Francisco after three years abroad, Dasovich explained that he came for treatment for internal bleeding that was apparently contracted from a parasite. He later revealed that he was diagnosed with a stage III colon cancer. He finished his last cycle of chemotherapy in early January 2018. In early February 2018, he revealed that he is cancer-free. On February 14, 2018, Dasovich confirmed that he and Alodia Gosiengfiao had begun a relationship.
