    "text": "Heat shock 70kDa protein 1B, also known as HSPA1B, is a human gene. This intronless gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family. ==Function== In conjunction with other heat shock proteins, this protein stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and in organelles. It is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through interaction with the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1. The gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, in a cluster with two closely related genes which encode similar proteins. ==Disease linkage== Patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection who harbor a HSPA1B-1267 single nucleotide polymorphism have a higher risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. ==See also== *Heat shock proteins *Hsp70 ==References== == External links == * Category:Heat shock proteins ",
