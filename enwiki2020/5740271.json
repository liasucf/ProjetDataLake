Judd Elementary School, Livingston Park Elementary School, and Parsons Elementary School, were all redistricted the summer before the 2008-2009 scholastic year in order to adjust to the growing population of North Brunswick Township. On December 13, 2016, a referendum was held to build a new middle school (called North Brunswick Township Middle School) on vacant land at Route 130 and Renaissance Boulevard North, which was passed by voters (1,807 in favor and 1,648 against).

The school broke ground on September 8, 2017 and is expected to be completed in time for the 2020-21 school year. Loyer, Susan. North Brunswick breaks ground at site of new middle school MyCentralJersey.com. Accessed August 4, 2019. The new middle school will only house students in 7th and 8th grade, instead of 6th through 8th. As a result, Linwood Middle School, the current middle school for students in grades 6-8, will become a 5-6 school (as the district's elementary schools were also overcrowded) and a wing of the school will also become the Early Childhood Center and the Board of Education office. The current Early Childhood Center, which is not even located in North Brunswick and instead in nearby Milltown in a building that the district has leased, will no longer be used by North Brunswick Schools. The Board of Education office is located in the former Maple Meade School, which will be sold and likely demolished after the offices are moved out and into Linwood School. Russell, Suzanne.
