He was a member of an architect family. His father Lovro /Laurence/ was a master builder in Zadar by the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century. He had brothers Nikola /Nicholas/, An\u0111eo /Angel/ and Petar /Peter/, who all succeeded his father's business and expanded it. At the beginning of the fourteenth century he settled in Dubrovnik and started his own business. In documents he is mentioned to have possessed a stonemasonry workshop in Dubrovnik in 1314. There he had an apprentice named Osroje Bogdanovi\u0107 from the Konavle region. His brother Nikola joined him in December 1316 and both of them obliged to work for the Dubrovnik Dominican Monastery, one of the most important architectural structures in the City of Dubrovnik, established in 1225 and completed in the fourteenth century. The brothers Juraj and Nikola built it in a simple Gothic architectural style. While Juraj was active in Dubrovnik, his brothers An\u0111eo and Petar were later working as architects and builders in Dubrovnik and Kotor as well. == See also == *List of Croatian architects *List of people from Zadar ==References== Category:Croatian architects Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Zadar Category:14th-century Croatian people Category:History of Dalmatia ",
