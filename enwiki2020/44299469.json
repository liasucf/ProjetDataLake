She has been raised in a modern set- up with an open minded loving family who have encouraged her to follow her career. Riya is in love with Abhimanyu who comes from the traditional Maheshwari family where love marriage is frowned upon and women are not allowed to work after marriage. Abhimanyu's tireless efforts enable him and Riya to be married although after a number of hiccups. Abhimanyu's mother, Rukmini, is a controlling traditional woman who agrees to the marriage to keep her son in the family but openly refuses to accept the modern Riya as her daughter-in-law. Riya's start in her marital home is difficult but she resolves to win over her mother-in-law whilst maintaining her principles. The story changed shortly after with the introduction of Aanchal, Abhimanyu's obsessive fan who died but has now returned as an evil spirit to be with him. The story then focuses on how Aanchal puts Abhimanyu's family in danger in trying to be with him by embodying and controlling Riya's physical form for her own motives. ==Cast== * Kinshuk Mahajan as Abhimanyu Maheshwari * Shefali Sharma as Dr. Riya Agarwal / Dr. Riya Abhimanyu Maheshwari * Madhura Naik as AanchalTum Aise Hi Rehna What mystery is Aanchal hiding - The Times of IndiaTum Aise Hi Rehna Ria to investigate about Aanchal\u2019s past connection with Abhi The Times of India * Indira Krishnan as Rukmini Kailash Maheshwari, Abhimanyu's motherAanchal to kill Rukmani in Tum Aise Hi Rehna - The Times of India * Sanjay Gandhi as Kailash Maheshwari, Abhimanyu's father * Meenakshi Verma as Dadi, Abhimanyu's grandmother * Raj Singh as Jatin MaheshwariTum Aise Hi Rehna: Raj Singh to play Kinshuk Mahajan's brother * Ankur Ghai as Sarthak Maheshwari * Namrata Thapa as Sheetal Sarthak Maheshwari * Gaurav Bajpai as Abhi's Cousin * Siddharth Vasudev as Rajeev KapoorSiddharth Vasudev replaces Nikhil Arya in Tum Aise Hi Rehna - The Times of India * Rishika Mihani as Anushka Rajeev Kapoor * Vikas Bhalla as Vishesh Agarwal, Riya's father * Smita Bansal as Lata Verma / Lata Vishesh Agarwal, Riya's mother ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 Indian television series debuts Category:Sony Entertainment Television original programming ",
