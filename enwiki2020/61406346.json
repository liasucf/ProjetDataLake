A: Dorsal view, B: Ventral view, Ey: Eye, Fa: Frontal appendage, He:H-element, Bp: Bilobate posterior region, Lp: Posterolateral process, Oc: Oral cone, Pe: P-element, Pn: P-element neck Cambroraster is an extinct genus of hurdiid radiodont, dating to the middle Cambrian, and represented by the single formally described species Cambroraster falcatus. Hundreds of specimens were found in the Burgess Shale, and described in 2019. A large animal (for its era) at up to 30cm long, it characterized by a significantly enlarged horseshoe-shaped dorsal carapace (H-element), and presumably fed by sifting through the sediment with its well-developed tooth plates (oral cone) and short frontal appendages with hooked spines. It is named partially after the fictional Millennium Falcon, which its dorsal carapace resembles.

This species is known only from a juvenile dorsal carapace, so it was not given a specific name. ==References== Category:Cambrian arthropods Category:Burgess Shale fossils Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 Category:Cambrian genus extinctions ",
