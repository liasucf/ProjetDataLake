However, Isma'il paid the sixty year-old king no courtesy. He later joined Isma'il's campaign in Sennar. Isma'il even retired to Shendi after the campaign; but while there demanded from Mek Nimr tributes of slaves and money. Nimr refused which led to a physical confrontation in which Isma'il struck the king. A few hours later, Nimr executed an attack on Isma'il in which he set his camp ablaze with him inside. He also had all his forces killed and ambushed his cavalry that arrived two days later. == Life in Exile == Isma'il's successor, Muhammed Khusraw al-Daftadar led a revenge campaign on Ja'alin. Many of whom including Mek Nimr went into exile. == References == == Sources == * * * Category:Rulers of Shendi Category:1846 deaths ",
