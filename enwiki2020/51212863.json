    "text": "{| |} The Sikorsky S-1 was the first fixed wing aircraft design by Igor Sikorsky. In February 1910 work began on the pusher configured biplane powered by a Anzani three-cylinder, air-cooled engine. The machine was completed in April and Sikorsky began his first attempts at flight. In early May during a take-off attempt on a windy day the machine briefly became airborne due mostly to the fact it had a favorable headwind. Further attempts were less successful and Sikorsky disassembled it, saving the main wing section to construct the S-2. ==Specifications== ==See also== ==References== S-036 Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Russian civil aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1910 ",
