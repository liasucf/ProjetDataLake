    "text": "Ban Dan Lan Hoi (, ) is a district (amphoe) in the western part of Sukhothai Province, in the lower north of Thailand. == History == In the Sukhothai era, the district area was the western camp of patrolling soldiers. The village near the camp was called Ban Lan Khoi (\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e22). The pronunciation changed with time to the present-day Ban Lan Hoi. In the Rattanakosin era, the Interior Ministry created a new sub-district (tambon) named Ban Dan. It was upgraded to a minor district (king amphoe) under Mueang Sukhothai District in 1909. The district office was moved to Tambon Lan Hoi in 1916. When the Charot Withi Thong road, connecting Sukhothai with Tak was finished, they moved the office to Tambon Ban Dan again. In 1939 the district was renamed from Lan Hoi to Ban Dan Lan Hoi. In 1973 the government upgraded the minor district to a full district. == Geography == Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Thung Saliam, Si Samrong, Mueang Sukhothai, Khiri Mat of Sukhothai Province, Phran Kratai of Kamphaeng Phet Province, Mueang Tak, Ban Tak, of Tak Province and Thoen of Lampang Province. == Administration == The district is divided into seven sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 70 villages (mubans). The township (thesaban tambon) Lan Hoi covers parts of the tambon Lan Hoi. There are a further seven tambon administrative organizations (TAO). {| ! No. ! Name ! Thai name ! Villages !
