While most of his work consists of editorial work, literary research, and literary compilation of other Caribbean authors, Rodr\u00edguez has written around 6 six publications exploring the concepts mentioned. \"Rodr\u00edguez is not so much a literary critic as a literary historian,\" wrote J. Michael Dash of NYU in a book review of Rodr\u00edguez's Haiti and Trans-Caribbean Identity. Rodr\u00edguez's novels explore the relations between Caribbean islands but specifically home in on Haitian relations. In Haiti and Trans-Caribbean Identity, Rodr\u00edguez explores the relations between Haiti and Cuba through a series of essays based on famous Haitian authors including: Fernand Hibbert, Jacques Stephen Alexis, Alejo Carpentier, and Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n. \"The only writers who meet Rodr\u00edguez's approval are those in whom the 'revolutionary and the artist' merge,\" noted Dash. Rodr\u00edguez, when discussing this novel, believes that there needs to be a greater importance and recognition of the relations and interactions between Haiti and its neighboring countries post-Haitian revolution (1791\u20131804). Through his research of letters and essays exchanged between Haitian writers and people within Cuba, while also having met some of the authors, Rodr\u00edguez explores how a sort of \"creolization\" of the two countries is occurring through the noted culture sharing/blending between Haitians and Cubans. Creolization is the idea that the Caribbean islands and their various cultures are blending together in a way that is creating a super culture and mankind, a creole. Rodr\u00edguez's study on the creolization of different Caribbean islands and cultures is aided by his immense knowledge and understanding of the different languages and language zones of the region. Several of his books and the works that he critics/edits are multi-lingual. The languages in which Rodr\u00edguez specializes are: Spanish, English, French, and Kweyol (Creole \u2013 a French-patios). Although Rodr\u00edguez has won several esteemed awards for his work in this area of study, he has also been criticized for focusing heavily on the Haitian relations with its Hispanic counterparts. \"The geographical reach of the essays can hardly be called 'trans-Caribbean' when the real focus appears to be the literary contacts between Haiti and the Hispanic Caribbean,\" notes Dash. In addition to the criticism of his area-specific analysis, Dash notes a note of bias in Rodr\u00edguez's work. \"At times more commissar than critic, his ultimate approval or disapproval depends on whether the novelist does or does not 'understand class struggle' (pg. 146).\" == References == Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas.
