Hadot also ran a small grocery store, supplemented by his woman in one and the other function. Hadot embraced with warmth the party of the Revolution, became municipal officer and a member of the Revolutionary Committee. Although he showed some moderation in performing these jobs, the school found himself completely abandoned after the and the couple was forced to take refuge in Paris. She soon became a widow and had no other resources to live than to engage in literary works in which she gave herself without reserve, while holding a small boarding school that had little success. Barth\u00e9lemy-Hadot was one of the most prolific writers in her genre. She found time to compose, from 1804 until her death, many melodramas for boulevard theatres and at the same time, many novels little remarkable in style and still and even less by invention, but whose intentions were good, with enough moral background. Over all, she made more than a hundred volumes, not counting those she left in manuscript, dramas and novels, most of which were not intended for education. Some of her plays that were performed remained unpublished. Others were neither presented nor printed. A daughter born in Troyes in 1795, married a Mr. Letac, and followed the same literary path than her mother. She wrote several novels which sometimes were wrongly attributed to Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde. == Main publications == === Theater === *1804: Zadig, ou la Destin\u00e9e, m\u00e9lodrame h\u00e9ro\u00efque in 5 acts from the novella by Voltaire, Paris, Fages, 1804, in-8\u00b0. *1800: Jean Sobieski, ou la Lettre, melodrama, Maldan, in-8\u00b0. *1806: Jules, ou le Toit paternel, melodrama, Maldan. *1806: L\u2019Homme myst\u00e9rieux, five-act melodrama, Maldan, in-8\u00b0. *1809: Cosme de M\u00e9dicis, three-act melodrama (with Ren\u00e9 Perin), Fages. *1816: L\u2019Honneur et l\u2019\u00c9chafaud, Barba. *1816: Les Deux Valladomir, three-act melodrama (with Victor Ducange), Fages, in-8\u00b0. *1814: Charles Martel (with Philippe-Jacques de Laroche), melodrama given 11 February at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, but not printed. === Novels === *1815: Anne de Russie et Catherine d\u2019Autriche, Paris, Pigoreau *1810: Clotilde de Hapsbourg, ou le Tribunal de Neustadt, Pigoreau *1816: Les H\u00e9ritiers du duc de Bouillon, ou les Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 Alger, Pigoreau, 4 vol. in-12. *1814: Jacques Ier, roi d\u2019\u00c9cosse, ou les Prisonniers de la tour de Londres, Pigoreau, 4 vol. in-12. *1812: Les Mines de Mazara, ou les Trois s\u0153urs, Pigoreau, 4 vol. in-12. *1818: Ernest de Vend\u00f4me, ou le Prisonnier de Vincennes, Pigoreau, 4 vol. in-12. *1815: La Tour du Louvre, ou le H\u00e9ros de Bouvines, Pigoreau, 4 vol. in-12. *1817: Isabelle de Pologne, ou la Famille fugitive, Pigoreau * Pierre le Grandet les Str\u00e9litz, ou la Forteresse de la Moscowa, Paris, Lecointe et Durey, 5 vol. in-12. * Mademoiselle de Montdidier, ou la Cour de Louis XI, Paris, A.
