Eski\u015fehir Demirspor won their first and only national championship title by defeating Fenerbah\u00e7e in the final. For Eski\u015fehir Demirspor it was the club's first and sole appearance in the championship final. After four years of interruption the championship was resumed again and was held in a new format. In 1937 the Turkish National Division was introduced, which was the national league contested by the top clubs of the three major leagues of Istanbul, Ankara, and \u0130zmir. The remaining cities which were not included in the National Division played in regional qualification groups like in the previous years, with the group winners competing against each other in a play-off. The club winning the play-off in 1940, Eski\u015fehir Demirspor, played against 1940 Turkish National Division winners Fenerbah\u00e7e. Eski\u015fehir Demirspor defeated Fenerbah\u00e7e in the final and thus became the first Turkish champions from outside Istanbul and Ankara. ==Final== ==See also== * 1940 Turkish National Division ==References== ==External links== *RSSSF Category:Turkish Football Championship seasons Turkish Turkey ",
