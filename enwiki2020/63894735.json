    "text": "Synthetic paper is a material made out of synthetic resin which is made to have properties similar to regular paper. Synthetic paper is usually made out of either biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The applications include paper for labels (thus that can bond with ink) and non-label paper. The products can be highly water resistant and flexible and durable and tear resistant. To the polypropylene resin can be added calcium carbonate. The market for synthetic paper includes packaged food and beverage consumption and cosmetics industries. == Notable manufacturers == * PPG Industries * Yupo Corporation * DuPont * Seiko Epson Corporation * AGFA- Gevaert N.V.
