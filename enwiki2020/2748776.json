    "text": "Lita Grey (born Lillita Louise MacMurray, April 15, 1908 \u2013 December 29, 1995), who was known for most of her life as Lita Grey Chaplin, was an American actress and the second wife of Charlie Chaplin. ==Background== She was born in Hollywood, California, and christened Lillita Louise MacMurray. Her father was of Scottish descent and her mother's family was descended from an illustrious 9th-generation Californian Spanish family, whose luminaries included Antonio Maria Lugo. The Lugos were from Andalusia, Spain and were one of the first to bring horses to the country.Chaplin, Lita Grey and Jeffrey Vance. (1998). Wife of the Life of the Party. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, pg. 2-3; . ==Personal life== Grey married four times. By her own account, she first met Charlie Chaplin at the age of eight at a Hollywood caf\u00e9 and first worked with him at the age of 12 in the part of the \"flirting angel\" in The Kid.\"The Gold Rush\". http://www.charliechaplin.com/. Charlie Chaplin: The Official Website. Retrieved September 17, 2014. She appeared briefly as a maid in The Idle Class. Her one-year contract was not renewed. At the age of 15, she met Chaplin again when she heard he was testing brunettes for his The Gold Rush.Chaplin, Lita Grey and Jeffrey Vance. (1998) Wife of the Life of the Party. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 4-13. . They had an affair and she suspected she had become pregnant by the then-35-year-old Chaplin. As he could have been imprisoned for having sexual relations with a minor, they married that November in secret in Empalme, Sonora, Mexico to avoid a scandal. They had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. Lita Grey in The Kid (1921) The marriage was troubled from the start. The two had few interests in common, and Chaplin spent as much time as he could away from home, working on The Gold Rush (in which Grey was to have played the female lead prior to becoming pregnant) and later The Circus. They divorced on August 22, 1927 due to his alleged numerous affairs with other women, and he was ordered to pay over US$600,000 ($ million in dollars) and US$100,000 ($ million in dollars) in trust for each child, in the largest divorce settlement at the time. Copies of her lengthy divorce complaint which made scandalous sexual claims against Chaplin were published and publicly sold, and the divorce became a sensational media event. She later married Henry Aguirre and Arthur Day. According to the 1940 United States Census, Lita and Arthur lived at 38 East 50th Street in New York City, and that in 1935, she had lived in England. The census listed her occupation as \"singer,\" and Arthur's as \"manager personal.\" She married her fourth husband, Patsy Pizzolongo (aka Pat Longo), on September 22, 1956, in Los Angeles, California. They were divorced in June 1966. In the 1970s and 1980s, she worked as a clerk at Robinson's Department Store in Beverly Hills. She wrote two autobiographical volumes covering her life with Chaplin. My Life with Chaplin (1966) was, by her own admission, largely a work of exaggeration and fabrication. She claimed to tell the story as it really was in her second memoir Wife of the Life of the Party (1998). Grey was portrayed by Deborah Moore in the 1992 film Chaplin, but Grey was depicted on screen for less than a minute in the final film. ==Death== She died in Los Angeles, at age 87 of cancer, and was buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year !style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title !style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role !style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Note |- |1983 ||Unknown Chaplin ||Herself ||TV |- |1979 ||The Hollywood Greats || Herself || TV |- |1953 || This Is Your Life || Herself || TV |- |1949 ||The Devil's Sleep || Judge Rosalind Ballentine || |- |1938 ||Skyline Revue|| Party Guest ||Short |- |rowspan=2|1933 ||Seasoned Greetings || Store Owner ||Short |- |Mr. Broadway ||Lita Grey || |- |1925 || The Gold Rush ||Extra ||Uncredited |- |rowspan=2|1921 ||The Idle Class ||Maid ||Uncredited |- |The Kid ||Flirtatious Angel ||Uncredited |} == Bibliography == * * * ==References== ==External links== * video: , 15 min. - 2-parts * * Lita Grey at Virtual History Category:1908 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American film actresses Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from cancer of unknown primary origin Category:Actresses from Hollywood, Los Angeles Category:20th-century American actresses Category:Chaplin family Category:Burials at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery ",
