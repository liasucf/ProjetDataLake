The community was originally named Monterey in honor of the Battle of Monterrey, where the Mississippi Rifles served under Colonel Jefferson Davis. Later that year, the name was changed to Buena Vista in honor of the Battle of Buena Vista, where the Mississippi troops and Davis again served. A post office only operated under the name Monterey in 1847 and operated under the name Buena Vista from 1847 to 1972. Buena Vista was once home to multiple stores and two churches. The Buena Vista Normal College opened in Buena Vista in 1885 and was chartered by the state of Mississippi the following year. The first agricultural high school in Mississippi opened in Buena Vista in 1908.
