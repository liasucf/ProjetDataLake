He was relatively independent of royal authority. He made many donations to the Abbey of Farfa and had a close relationship with Abbot Fulcoald. On his death, the duchy was probably seized by Aistulf and then granted to one Unnolf for a brief spell. ==References== ==Sources== *Hodgkin, Thomas. Italy and her Invaders. Clarendon Press: 1895.
