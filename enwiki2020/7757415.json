    "text": "W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wiktoryn Sici\u0144ski (; \u20131672) was a member of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian nobility and dignitary of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lord Master-of- the-Table (since 1655) and Lord Vice-Justice (since 1666) of Upyt\u0117, he was among the deputies of the Trakai Voivodeship nobility to the Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth of 1652 which took place during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. He is credited with using the liberum veto for the first time in Polish history during the Sejm. Some historians have speculated that he might have acted on orders from Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142, though Wisner observed there is no evidence to support this theory. After the partitions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, writers searched for causes of the collapse of the state. They blamed Golden Liberty and liberum veto for creating anarchy and disorder that led to the downfall and Sici\u0144ski, a Protestant and a provincial man, became the villain of history who sacrificed the greater good for his narrow self interests. In 1850s, local residents of Upyt\u0117 claimed that a certain mummy was the body of Sici\u0144ski. It was placed in a special cabinet in the local church. After the Uprising of 1863, Governor General of Vilna Mikhail Muravyov- Vilensky ordered the mummy to be secretly buried to quell local superstitions. The order was carried out in August 1865. ==Legend in literature== Sici\u0144ski became legendary as an incredibly cruel landlord in Lithuanian folk legends and is a popular character in Lithuanian and Polish literature.
