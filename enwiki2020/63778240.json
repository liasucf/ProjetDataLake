    "text": "Among the Oak & Ash is an American rock and folk band founded in 2008 by songwriter, composer, and producer, Josh Joplin. The albums reflect a loose affiliation of musicians partnering with Joplin. Producer and bassist Brian Harrison and drummer Bryan Owings were the primary rhythm section. They recorded Among the Oak & Ash (2009) and Devil Ship (2013) before Harrison's sudden death in 2014. Other contributing musicians have included Garrison Starr, who was prominently featured on the self-titled debut, which Verve Records released in 2009. == Among the Oak & Ash == This was the most widely released album of the group. Their version of \"Shady Grove\" is featured in the Alan Wake video game series. The record was featured on Bob Harris's Sunday Country and Roots Music show on BBC Radio 2, as well as NPR's Mountain Stage, WNYC's SoundCheck, and Woodsongs. == Devil Ship == Produced by Joplin and Harrison, this record features musicians Paleface, Jessica Lea Mayfield, Lucy Wainwright Roche, Robby Turner, Front Country's bassist Jeremy Darrow, Cari Norris, Bailey Cooke, Wes Langlois, David Mayfield, and members of Ghostfinger, Richie Kirkpatrick (guitar) and Ben Martin (drums).
