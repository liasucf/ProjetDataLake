    "text": "Romani people in Tunisia speak the Domari language. They immigrated to the territory of the present day Tunisia from South Asia, particularly from India, in Byzantine times. Romani (Dom or Nawar) people self-segregated themselves for centuries from the dominant culture of Tunisia, who view Romani as dishonorable though clever. Historically, Gypsies in Tunisia have provided musical entertainment as weddings and other celebrations. The Romani people or Gypsies in Tunisia include subgroups like Nawar, Halebi and Ghagar. ==See also== *Romani people in Egypt *Romani people in Libya *Romani people in Syria *Romani people in Iraq *Nawar people ==References== ==External links== *The Gypsies of Tunisia , Dom Research Center Category:Ethnic groups in Tunisia Category:Dom in Africa Category:Dom people ",
