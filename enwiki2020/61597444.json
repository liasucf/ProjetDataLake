It has been fully restored. The ornamental bridge was constructed in the mid 19th century, and was listed on 29 November 2001. A hydroelectric scheme was installed at the site circa 1900; it was restored in 2000, and is used to provide power to the visitor centre and local area. == References == Category:Biddulph Category:Country parks in Staffordshire ",
