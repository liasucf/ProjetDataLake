    "text": "Anne Josephine Robinson (born 26 September 1944) is an English television presenter and journalist. She is known for her acerbic style of presenting and reality television shows. She presented the British programme Points of View (1987\u20131997) and was one of the presenters on the consumer affairs show Watchdog (1993\u20132001, 2009\u20132015). Robinson gained her highest profile as the host of the BBC game show The Weakest Link (2000\u20132012), a role she reprised on the American version of the show (2001 to 2002). Robinson also returned to the role for a special in honour of Children in Need in November 2017. ==Early life== Robinson was born in Crosby, Lancashire, on 26 September 1944 and is of Irish descent.\"Memoirs of an Unfit Mother by Anne Robinson\" \u2013 Post.ie \u2013 11 November 2001 Her father was a schoolteacher. Her mother, Anne Josephine (n\u00e9e Wilson), who was an alcoholic, was an agricultural businesswoman from Northern Ireland, where she was the manager of a market stall. When she came to England, she married into her husband's family of wholesale chicken dealers, and sold rationed rabbit after the Second World War. She inherited the family market stall in Liverpool and transformed it into one of the largest wholesale poultry dealing businesses in the north of England. Brought up initially at the family home in Crosby, Robinson attended a private Roman Catholic convent boarding school in Hampshire, Farnborough Hill Convent, now known as Farnborough Hill. She was hired as a chicken gutter and saleswoman during the holidays in the family business, before taking office jobs at a law firm. The family spent their summers on holiday in France, often at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. ==Career== ===Early career=== On leaving school, Robinson chose journalism over training for the theatre. After working in a news agency, she arrived in London in 1967 as the first young female trainee on the Daily Mail. Robinson's mother's going-away present to her daughter was an MG sports car and a fur coat. Robinson secured a permanent position as a result of scooping the details of the story of Brian Epstein's death from being a family friend of the Liverpool solicitor handling the legalities, offering him a ride to Euston railway station when he could not find an available taxi. Her work became more uncomfortable for her when she met and fell in love with the deputy news editor, Charlie Wilson; the couple married in 1968, but he subsequently had to sack her as a result of the marriage. Robinson joined The Sunday Times, and in 1970 the couple had a daughter, Emma Wilson, who is now a British radio disc jockey and has also hosted Scaredy Camp, a game show in the United States on the Nickelodeon network. In December 1978, she resigned from The Sunday Times and returned home to Crosby. She then began working for the Liverpool Echo. ===Press=== Robinson returned to Fleet Street in 1980, working as columnist and assistant editor of the Daily Mirror from the week that the Falklands War started. She also wrote a column under the pseudonym of the \"Wednesday Witch\", in which she developed her vitriolic style. During her career as a newspaper journalist, she developed a flair for writing tabloid headlines. On 14 November 1982, Robinson attended a formal dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II, at which she noted that Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived late. Robinson asked the Mirrors Royal editor James Whitaker to investigate and, after conversations with various sources including Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, confirmed that Diana was suffering from an eating disorder, named as anorexia in a scoop article on 19 November 1982. As a result, Buckingham Palace Press Secretary Michael Shea rang then Mirror editor Mike Molloy, asking him to remove Robinson. She was subsequently removed from the editorial rota, and was advised by Molloy to \"do more television, blossom, that's what you're good at\". Robinson has written weekly columns for a succession of other British newspapers, such as Today, The Sun, The Express, The Times, and The Daily Telegraph. ===Television and radio=== Robinson began appearing on BBC television in 1982, initially as an occasional panellist on Question Time and presenting her 'TV Choice' on Breakfast Time. From 1986, she began sitting in on television viewers' show Points of View for regular presenter Barry Took, taking over from Took permanently in 1988 and remaining for 11 years. In 1993, she took over the presentation and writing of the consumer affairs television programme Watchdog. Robinson presented a Saturday morning show on Radio 2 from 1988 to 1993. Robinson is best known in the UK for hosting the game show The Weakest Link, and in the United States its NBC primetime counterpart, Weakest Link. She originally started with an icy, mysterious appearance and persona, remaining indifferent to funny and friendly moments throughout; however, she toned down that approach over the years, with her often smiling and on occasion laughing, especially on the celebrity episodes. Her use of insults, caustic remarks and personal questions fiercely directed at contestants became famous. Her blunt utterance \"You are the weakest link \u2013 goodbye!\" became a catchphrase soon after the show started in 2000. Asked by the Duke of Edinburgh to present some Duke of Edinburgh's Awards, she agreed subject to his taking part in the Weakest Link. The Duke declined. In 2005, she made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, admitting she had been an unfit mother.Memoirs of an Unfit Mother Also in 2005, she appeared on an episode of the revived Doctor Who, entitled \"Bad Wolf\", voicing a futuristic android version of herself named the \"Anne Droid\" on a lethal version of The Weakest Link in the year 200,100. When contestants lose, the android blasts them with a disintegrator in its mouth, which really teleports them away to a Dalek fleet.Bad Wolf / The Parting of the Ways Robinson hosted the BBC's outtakes programme Outtake TV until 2009. She currently hosts a satirical news-based chat show on BBC One called What's the Problem? With Anne Robinson, and the BBC's interactive quiz Test the Nation. In 2009, Robinson returned to presenting BBC One's long-running consumer show Watchdog. She finished presenting The Weakest Link in 2012 after twelve years as the host of 1,693 shows. On 10 September 2015, it was announced that Robinson would step down from Watchdog once again, this time in order to film a new series of Britain's Spending Secrets for the channel. She had presented Watchdog for a total of 15 years. In 2016, Robinson presented Anne Robinson's Britain for BBC One. The series consisted of three episodes, each focusing on different aspects of British life. Episode one was centred on parenting, episode two on the nation's love of pets and particularly cats and dogs, and the final episode focused on the nation's fixation with how they look. ==Personal life== In 1973, Robinson lost a custody battle for her only child, Emma, then aged two. Charles Wilson was granted sole custody, care and control of Emma, who subsequently lived with her father until she left home at 16 for boarding school.\"Anne Robinson: The real Mrs Terrible\" 17 October 2001, The Independent An admitted alcoholic, Robinson stopped drinking on 12 December 1978 after picking her daughter up from school and driving to a petrol station to buy a bottle of vodka. Robinson married journalist John Penrose in 1980. On 30 September 2007, the couple announced that they were planning to divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". In 2001, she published her autobiography, Memoirs of an Unfit Mother, in which she describes her former drinking problem. In 2001, Robinson was diagnosed with skin cancer and had surgery to treat it. She has two grandchildren. ==Controversies== In 2001, she was accused of racism towards the Welsh, after describing them as \"irritating and annoying\" while appearing as a guest on Room 101. The BBC received 16 complaints after Robinson asked wine connoisseur Olly Smith, who was competing on the celebrity version of The Weakest Link, to feel her breasts, after he described her as a \"full-bodied, expensive red\". The programme was broadcast on Saturday 5 April 2008 on BBC One. Robinson caused controversy on The Weakest Link when she made former Blue Peter presenter John Noakes cry after asking \"What was the end for Shep?\" Shep had been Noakes's pet dog both on and off Blue Peter. Robinson is a vocal supporter of fox hunting and, before it was banned in 2004, was a key supporter of the pro-hunt cause. The Guardian claims she has ridden with the White Horse Hunt. In an interview with Radio Times in September 2000, Robinson was asked what her first act as world leader would be, replying: \"I'd lock up all the hunt saboteurs because they are destructive. They are campaigning about something of which they know nothing.\"\"What are the rights of cockroaches?\" Auberon Waugh, Fortune City In February 2002, she hosted a spin-off version of The Weakest Link in Cirencester to raise funds for the local White Horse Hunt. The event was picketed by around 100 protesters from the League Against Cruel Sports, around 70 animal rights activists returning from another demonstration joined the picket, culminating in a near riot. The event eventually went ahead after Robinson was escorted into the venue by local police.\"Anne told: You are the Weakest Link, Anti-Hunt Protesters Jeer TV Quiz Queen at Mock Game Show\" 18 February 2002, Daily Post (Liverpool, England) A report published in 2006, which concluded that the BBC is \"endemically homophobic\", highlighted as one example of anti-gay bigotry in the network Robinson's treatment of a male contestant at The Weakest Link - Celebrity Chefs, to whom she made questions such as \"What do you do in your restaurant - just mince around?\", and \"Before you go, and bear in mind that this is a family show, what's the strangest thing you've ever put in your mouth?\" The previous year she was also accused of bigotry when she told a female prison officer that she must be a lesbian. At the end of October 2017 on BBC Radio's Today programme, Robinson responded to the accusations of sexual abuse made against multiple men which had followed Harvey Weinstein allegations published earlier in the month. She accused women of not complaining until now. According to Robinson, \"40 years ago, there were very few of us women in power and, I have to say, we had a much more robust attitude to men behaving badly\". At the present time, she claimed, there \"is a sort of fragility amongst women who aren't able to cope with the treachery of the workplace\". Referring to an allegation made against the trade minister Mark Garnier about him asking a female assistant to buy sex toys: \"It shouldn't be happening but, on the other hand, why have women lost confidence\". She said this incident led her to be \"in despair\". Robinson outlined her method of dealing with the problem: \"In my day we gave them a slap, and told them to grow up!\" Robinson was accused of victim blaming on social media. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century British journalists Category:20th-century British non-fiction writers Category:20th-century English women writers Category:21st-century British journalists Category:21st- century British non-fiction writers Category:21st-century English women writers Category:Daily Mail journalists Category:Daily Mirror people Category:English autobiographers Category:English columnists Category:English game show hosts Category:English journalists Category:English non-fiction writers Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English radio DJs Category:English television presenters Category:English women journalists Category:English women non-fiction writers Category:English people of Northern Ireland descent Category:Journalists from Liverpool Category:People educated at Farnborough Hill Category:People from Crosby, Merseyside Category:The Sunday Times people Category:Television presenters from Liverpool Category:The Times people Category:Writers from Liverpool Category:BBC Radio 2 presenters Category:Women autobiographers Category:Women radio presenters Category:Women columnists ",
