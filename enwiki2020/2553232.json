    "text": "Jean Bernab\u00e9 (1942 in Le Lorrain, Martinique \u2013 12 April 2017 in Fort-De- France, Martinique) was a writer and linguist. Bernab\u00e9 was a professor of language and culture at the Universit\u00e9 Antilles-Guyane. He was an important figure in the cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement, having co-authored the seminal 1989 essay on the subject, Eloge de la cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 (In Praise of Creoleness), with Patrick Chamoiseau and Rapha\u00ebl Confiant. Although Bernab\u00e9's work lauds the Cr\u00e9ole language, on which he has written seminal works, his literary creation is exclusively in the French language. ==Bibliography== * Fondal-Natal, essay (1976) * Fondas-Kr\u00e9yol, essay (1982) * Eloge de la cr\u00e9olit\u00e9, essay (1989) (with Patrick Chamoiseau and Rapha\u00ebl Confiant) * Le bailleur d'\u00e9tincelle, novel (2002) * Le partage des anc\u00eatres, novel (2004) *Sur les chemins de l'histoire antillaise.
