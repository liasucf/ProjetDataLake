In 1880 he started to publish Russkaya Mysl (which is seen in retrospect as having provided an ideological background for the Russian Constitutional Democrat Party) and in 1882 became its editor-in-chief. Lavrov was considered Russia's best translator from Polish of his time. Among the translations he's made were the novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz, Zygmunt Mi\u0142kowski, Eliza Orzeszkowa, Maria Konopnicka and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont.Lavrova, Anna. \u00ab\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u044c\u00bb 125 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 // Russkaya Mysl 125 Years Ago\u0412\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043b \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0432 at the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. == References == Category:1852 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Burials at Vagankovo Cemetery Category:Imperial Russian editors Category:Imperial Russian journalists Category:Imperial Russian translators Category:People from Oryol Governorate Category:People from Yelets ",
