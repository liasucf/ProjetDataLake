She starred in various films throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and is considered to have been one of Hong Kong's biggest stars of the period. ==Biography== Born as Wang Jiuling, Ye's family moved to Taiwan in 1948. She was cast in a 1954 film in Taiwan that never reached production, after which the directors Li Han-hsiang and Li Zuyong recommended her and she was signed to Motion Pictures and General Investment (MP&GI;). Ye made her screen debut in 1957 in the musical Our Sister Hedy, which tells the story of four sisters and their sibling rivalries. She left MP&GI; in 1962, after which she signed with the Shaw Brothers Studio, one of the largest production companies in Hong Kong. She retired in 1969, but made a cameo in frequent co-star Lin Cui's 1975 comedy. Ye currently works as a businesswoman. ==Personal life== Ye married fellow-actor Chang Yang in 1961. The couple divorced in 1965. ==Filmography== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Title ! Role !
