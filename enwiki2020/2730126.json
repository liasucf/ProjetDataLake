On 1 July 2015, the Frogman Corps transferred from the Royal Danish Navy to the newly established Special Operations Command. ==History== The Frogman Corps was established on 17 June 1957 based on the model of the United Kingdom Royal Marines Special Boat Company, US Underwater Demolition Team, and Marinejegerkommandoen, in Norway. Initially it was under the Danish Navy's Diving School at Fl\u00e5destation Holmen (Naval Station Holmen, Copenhagen), but in 1972 it was made an independent unit, operationally under the submarine squadron. ==Role== The Frogman Corps' primary role is reconnaissance, but it is also tasked with assaulting enemy ships, sabotage of fixed installations, advanced force and maritime anti- terrorism tasks. It also performs special operations work on land, including anti-terrorism and anti-criminal work. The Corps supports the police with matters that demand highly specialised diving. Local authorities, etc. can also benefit from the frogmen's skills, for example when underwater installations must be inspected. ==Training== The Frogman Corps trains at the Torpedo Station at Kongs\u00f8re and works through a long series of courses, e.g.: *Combat swimmer course for three weeks *Advanced scuba diving course *Rescue swimmer course *Survival course The basic Frogman Course is nine months. Each year 500\u2013600 applicants start the course and less than a dozen complete all nine months. Since its creation in 1957, 311 have completed the training and become frogmen . Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark passed selection and completed continuation training to become a badged Frogman, in the course of which he earned the nickname \"Pingo\". In 2015, a DR-produced documentary detailing the life of Frogman cadets was released. ==Operations== The Frogman Corps was involved in operations in Afghanistan such as Task Force K-Bar and in Iraq. From 2008 until the end of 2014, the Frogman Corps was involved in counter-piracy operations as part of Operation Ocean Shield. On 5 February 2010, ten Frogman Corps members aboard HDMS Absalon (L16) conducted a counter- piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden approaching the Antigua and Barbuda-flagged merchant vessel Ariella by rigid hull inflatable boat which had been hijacked by six armed Somali pirates. They scaled the side of the ship and freed the 25 crew, who had locked themselves in a secure room, and continued to search the vessel for the pirates who had however fled. ==Equipment== * Glock 17 * Heckler & Koch MP5 * Gev\u00e6r M/10 (Colt Canada C8 IUR rifle) * Finskyttegev\u00e6r M/04 (Sako TRG-42) * GRK M/03 40 mm (Colt Canada M203A1) * Dysekanon M/85 (Carl Gustav M3) * Panserv\u00e6rnsv\u00e5ben M/97 (AT-4 CS) ==Gallery== File:US Navy 090219-N-1082Z-064 The visit, board, search and seizure team from the Danish flexible support ship HDMS Absalon (L 16) trains trains aboard USS Vella Gulf (CG 72).jpg File:US Navy 090219-N-6278K-006 The visit, board, search and seizure team from the Danish flexible support ship HDMS Absalon (L 16) conduct VBSS training aboard USS Vella Gulf (CG-72).jpg File:US Navy 090219-N-6278K-024 - VBSS assigned to the Danish flexible support ship HDMS Absalon (L 16) boards USS Vella Gulf (CG 72).jpg File:US Navy 090219-N-6278K-062 The visit, board, search and seizure team from the Danish flexible support ship HDMS Absalon (L 16) conduct VBSS training aboard USS Vella Gulf (CG-72).jpg ==See also== * List of military diving units (including special forces) * List of military special forces units ==References== ==External links== * Danish Defence Fr\u00f8mandskorpset (in Danish) * Official Facebook Fr\u00f8mandskorpset page (in Danish) Category:Armed forces diving Category:Counter-terrorist organizations Category:Military units and formations established in 1957 Category:Naval special forces units Category:Special forces of Denmark Category:Terrorism in Denmark ",
