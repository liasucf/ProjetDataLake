    "text": "The 2019\u201320 NBL season was the 42nd season for the Illawarra Hawks in the NBL. == Roster == === Depth Chart === == Pre-Season == The Hawks started their pre-season later than most teams, with their first game on 7 September. They played three regular pre-season games (two of which were against other NBL teams) before playing in the NBL Blitz against Melbourne United and the Perth Wildcats. The Hawks then continued their pre-season with a final regular game against the Sydney Kings, however opted against playing more games in the NBLxNBA series. === Ladder === === Game log === |-
