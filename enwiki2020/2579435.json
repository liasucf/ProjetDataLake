    "text": "The Battle of Atapuerca was fought on 1 September 1054 at the site of Piedrahita (\"standing stone\") in the valley of Atapuerca between two brothers, King Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre and King Ferdinand I of Castile. The Castilians won and King Garc\u00eda and his favourite Fort\u00fan S\u00e1nchez were killed in battle.Joseph F. O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, (Cornell University Press, 1975), 195. Ferdinand reannexed Navarrese territory he conceded to Garc\u00eda 17 years earlier after his brother's assistance at Pisuerga. ==Precedents== After the death of Sancho III of Navarre, his empire was divided. Garc\u00eda, the eldest son, received the Kingdom of Navarre, while younger son Ferdinand already controlled what was then the County of Castile, owing fealty to his brother-in-law, Bermudo III of Le\u00f3n. In 1037, with Garcia's help, Ferdinand defeated and killed the childless Bermudo at the battle of Tamar\u00f3n, and claimed the crown of Le\u00f3n in right of his wife, Bermudo's sister, being crowned in 1038. He rewarded Garc\u00eda by ceding to him Castilian territories from Oca to the gates of Burgos, from Briviesca to the valley of Urbel, from Castrobarto to Bricia, and from the Nervi\u00f3n River to Santander. ==Versions== ===Chronicon Silense=== The monk of Silos wrote several decades later that an envious Garc\u00eda attacked Ferdinand who was visiting him at N\u00e1jera during his illness. After recovering, Garc\u00eda paid a return visit to Ferdinand to make peace. King Ferdinand put him in chains and locked him in a tower in Cea. However, the Navarrese escaped and declared war, rejecting the Castilian embassies. Garc\u00eda was buried in the nearby village of Ag\u00e9s and his tomb was recently discovered in the church there. The hosts of Castile and Le\u00f3n were in Atapuerca, three leagues eastwards from Burgos, already in Navarre. Garc\u00eda had with him Moorish auxiliary troops and maybe his brother king Ramiro I of Aragon. ===Annals of Compostela=== The Annales compostellani attribute the death of Garc\u00eda to one knight of his, Sancho Fort\u00fan, \"whom he [the king], had offended with his wife\". Several in the Navarrese retinue preferred death in combat, and also the murderer, lord of Funes, Navarre, died in battle. ===Cr\u00f3nica Najerense=== The Cr\u00f3nica Najerense mentions relatives of Vermudo, who furiously engaged Garc\u00eda, disobeying Ferdinand's instructions to take him alive. The Navarrese kept however their places until night and took the corpse to bury him in N\u00e1jera. The proclaimed on the spot the new king, an adolescent Sancho de Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n. ===Other version=== Ferdinand is in this version the reckless brother and covets the \"Asturias of Santander\", Old Castile, Briviesca and Rioja. Ferdinand visited his ill brother, but suspecting him fled. Garc\u00eda visited an ill Ferdinand then, wishing to dispel his suspicions, but was locked in Cea. Upon escaping, he took his troops and some Moors into Castile. In Atapuerca the peace talks failed. Two traitor soldiers (one of them, Sancho Fort\u00fan), wounded him lethally. Ferdinand conceded the transport of the corpse to N\u00e1jera, took Briviesca, Montes de Oca and part of Rioja. The border of Navarre was set by the Ebro, and the new king Sancho IV of Navarre became Ferdinand's vassal. ===El Cid?=== Some sources mention El Cid as one of the battlers, but being born on 1043 or 1048 he would be too young. ==Later history== In 1940 a commemorative inscription was carved on a 6,000-year-old menhir at the site. Since 1996, the people of Atapuerca and neighbour towns reenact the battle on the last or previous Sunday of August. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * Atapuerca Category:11th century in Navarre Atapuerca Category:1054 in Europe Category:Battles of the Reconquista Category:Battles in Castile and Le\u00f3n Category:History of the province of Burgos ",
