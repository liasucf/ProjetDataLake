He had learning difficulties and from 1907 (his father's death), his brother Elias took up the role as head of the family and served as regent throughout his and his brother Joseph's titular reigns. However, Enrico continued to be considered by legitimists as Henry of Parma. Enrico died in 1939 at Pianore, near Lucca, Italy, unmarried and without issue. He was succeeded as titular pretender of Parma by his brother Joseph. ==Ancestry== ==See also== *Duchy of Parma *House of Bourbon-Parma Category:Pretenders to the throne of Parma Category:Princes of Bourbon-Parma Category:Princes of Parma and Piacenza Henry I Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Henry I of Parma Henry I of Parma ",
