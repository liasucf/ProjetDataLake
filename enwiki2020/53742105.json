The company primarily treats end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which requires patients to undergo dialysis 3 times per week for the rest of their lives. The company has a 37% market share in the U.S. dialysis market. It is organized in Delaware and based in Denver. In 2019, 69% of the company's revenues came from Medicare and other government-based health insurance programs. In 2019, 90% of the company's patients were covered by government- based health insurance programs. Commercial payers, which accounted for 31% of revenues in 2019, generate all of the company's profit as they reimburse at a much higher rate than government-based health insurance programs. The company is ranked 188th on the Fortune 500. The name \"DaVita\" is derived from the Italian language phrase \"Dare Vita\", which means \"giving life\". ==History== The company was founded in 1979 as Medical Ambulatory Care, Inc., a subsidiary of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. (now Tenet Healthcare). In August 1994, 70% of the company was acquired by DLJ Merchant Banking Partners in a leveraged buyout for $75.5 million, including a $10.5 million investment by DLJ. The company then changed its name to Total Renal Care Holdings, Inc. In October 1995, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $107 million. By December 1996, DLJ had made a 386% return on its $10.5 million investment. On February 27, 1998, the company acquired Renal Treatment Centers for $1.3 billion in stock. The integration went poorly and in July 1999, the CEO and CFO resigned. After tripling in value between 1995 and 1998, by July 1999, the stock price was down 71% year-to-date. In October 1999, Kent J. Thiry, then 43 years old, was named CEO. In 2000, the company sold its non-U.S. operations. In October 2000, the company was renamed DaVita Inc.

In June 2015, the company agreed to pay $450 million to settle allegations that it unnecessarily disposed of drugs and then billed the U.S. federal government for this waste. In June 2018, a jury awarded the families of 3 of the company's patients $383 million in wrongful death claims after the patients died from cardiac arrest after undergoing treatment at DaVita centers. ===Healthcare Partners=== In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners for $4.42 billion.
