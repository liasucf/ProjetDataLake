    "text": "Abigor is an Austrian black metal band formed in 1993. They are named after an upper demon of war in Christian demonology. ==History== The band was formed in 1993 by Peter Kubik and Thomas Tannenberger. After the release of several demos, original vocalist Tharen (Alexander Opitz) left the band and was replaced by Silenius (Michael Gregor), who recorded vocals for all Abigor releases until the recording of Channeling the Quintessence of Satan during which he opted to leave the band.Odle, Kevin \"[ Abigor Biography]\", AllMusic Thurisaz, who had been in the thrash metal band Lost Victim together with T.T. in the 1980s, joined the band and finished recordings on Channeling the Quintessence of Satan. In late 1999, T.T. left the band for various reasons (ranging from personal problems to being fed up with what once was the \"scene\"). After his departure, Abigor released two more albums before breaking up in 2003. In April 2006, P.K. and T.T. decided to join forces again. During the following year, Fractal Possession was released. The band was scheduled to release a split EP in 2008 with French black metal group Blacklodge. In connection with this release, Abigor was supposedly cooperating with Norwegian experimental artist Zweizz. Early works by Abigor were loosely inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The album cover on Orkblut - The Retaliation is a collage of 2 paintings originally made by Lord of the Rings fantasy artist Ian Miller. The album cover on Channeling the Quintessence of Satan was originally by the German printmaker/artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer. (The Knight, Death and the Devil, 1514) Most Abigor releases were released by Napalm Records. In a 2007 interview, P.K. explained the band's songwriting process: > \"T.T. and I are responsible for the music, A.R. will do the lyrics and > vocals, that\u2019s how it works. I create riffs and record it, T.T. too, we send > us files, create rough song-structures till we\u2019re satisfied with the result > of a song/album-\u201cconcept\u201d then we start the recordings at T.T.\u2019s Hell-Lab > Studio.\"Abigor Interview\", Heathenharvest.com, September 2007 ==Personnel== * P.K. - Guitars * T.T. \u2013 Drums, Guitars, Bass ===Former members=== *Tharen (formerly known as \"Rune\") \u2013 Vocals (1993\u20131994) *Silenius \u2013 Vocals (1994\u20131999) *Thurisaz \u2013 Vocals, bass (1999\u20132001) *Moritz N. - Drums *Lucia-M.
