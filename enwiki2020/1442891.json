    "text": "BCX is a BASIC to C computer language translator created by Kevin Diggins in 1999. BCX's new official website https://BcxBasicCoders.com went live in October 2019. BCX converts BASIC source code to C source code which can be compiled using a number of available C/C++ compilers on MS Windows. For many years, most implementations of BASIC shared a nagging drawback - BASIC programs performed slower than similar programs that were created using C/C++. BCX helped change that by giving BASIC programmers the joy of programming in a modern BASIC language while coupling its output with the high performance of a C/C++ compiler. BCX is written in the BCX BASIC language, making BCX a self- translating translator. BCX was made an open source project in 2004. Since then, several members of the BCX community have led the development and maintenance of the BCX project. Past project forks have resulted in variants of BCX that produces native-code applications for Linux, Apple, and Atari operating systems. BCX contains statements and functions that simplify the creation of Windows UI desktop applications. Unlike many BASIC implementations that rely on run-time engines, the combination of BCX and most C/C++ compilers produce efficient, high performing native code applications. BCX easily creates GUI, DLL, console mode, and web server applications. ==External links== *2019 BCX website (2019) https://bcxbasiccoders.com *BCX Online Help System *BCX on Sourceforge == References == ;Notes * CNET . * About . * RJP . * My-Tech-Site .
