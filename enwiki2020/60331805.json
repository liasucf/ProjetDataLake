    "text": "The rise of Genghis Khan involves the events from his birth as Tem\u00fcjin in 1162 until 1206, when he was bestowed the title of \"Genghis Khan\" (sometimes \"Chingis Khan\"), which means something along the lines of \"Universal Ruler\" or \"Oceanic Ruler\". ==The Mongols prior to Genghis Khan== The locations of the Mongol tribes during the Khitan Liao dynasty (907\u20131125) The Mongols first appeared in the dynastic history of the Tang dynasty and were described as a branch of the Shiwei, who were vassals of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks from 553 to 745. The Shiwei lived in the Lesser Khingan Range until the 10th century when the Mongol component moved to the Argun River and became vassals of the Khitans. The Mongols continued moving west until they reached the Onon River and Kherlen River in the 11th century. Alternatively according to Mongol mythology, they were descended from a blue-grey wolf birthed by Heaven, and a fallow doe. Together they crossed a lake to reach Burkhan Khaldun where they gave birth to a human male. This human male, named Bat Tsagan, was the ancestor of all Mongols. In the 11th generation of Bat Tsagan's lineage, Dobun Mergen married a young woman named Alan Gho'a of the Khorilar. After Dobun Mergen died, Alan Gho'a gave birth to Bodonchar Munkhag, who founded the Borjigin clan. Bodonchar's great-great-grandson Kaidu was born sometime during the 11th century and was the first khagan who \"ruled all the Mongols\". His grandson Khabul Khan was invited to the Jin court at one point and in a drunken outburst, tweaked the Jin emperor's beard. The emperor initially decided to let Khabul go unpunished but changed his mind and ordered his officials to have Khabul captured. The Jin pursuers were ambushed and killed, and Khabul died shortly after, depriving the Jin any chance of revenge. From 1135 to 1147, the Mongols continuously raided Jin borders. The Jin retaliated and allied with the Tatars, who captured the new Mongol khan, Ambaghai of the Taichiud, under the pretense of making peace and handed him over to the Jin court. Before he was captured, Ambaghai managed to send a messenger back to his kinsmen, urging them to fight the Tatars to the death. Ambaghai was nailed to a wooden donkey and left to die. Around the time of Ambaghai's capture in the 1150s or 1160s, Khabul's grandson Yesugei abducted a Khongirad woman as his bride from the Merkits. He participated in a series of raids launched by Hotula Khan against the Tatars. Upon his return from one of these attacks, his wife gave birth to Tem\u00fcjin, who would become Genghis Khan. ==Childhood (1162-1177)== Genghis Khan was born as Tem\u00fcjin in 1162 to Yesugei, the leader of the Borjigin clan, and Hoelun of the Olkhonud tribe. In 1171, Yesugei took Tem\u00fcjin east through Tatar territory to the Khongirad, who were closely related to the Olkhonud tribe of his wife, to arrange a future marriage between his son and B\u00f6rte. Tem\u00fcjin was left behind with the Khongirad to learn their ways, however Yesugei was poisoned by the Tatars during his return trip. Tem\u00fcjin left the Khongirad for his father, but arrived too late to see his father alive. His father's followers scattered and Hoelun was left to care for her children by herself. She took them to the Khentii Mountains where they lived for several years eking out an existence through fishing and grubbing roots. Little is known about the events of Tem\u00fcjin's life during these years except for three flashpoints. At one point Tem\u00fcjin killed his half-brother Begter for stealing a fish. He then became the captive of the Taichiud and lived in a cage for some time before escaping with the help of a tribesman named Suldus Shira. In 1173, he became the blood brother (anda) of Jamukha from the Jadaran (Jajirad) clan. The Jadaran clan considered itself descended from the Borjigids, but others say they were an illegitimate offshoot of uncertain birth. ==Becoming khan== Tem\u00fcjin and co. attack the Merkits in 1191 Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha's falling out, 1193-1194 ===Early leadership (1177-1191)=== In 1177, Tem\u00fcjin went back to the Khongirad and married B\u00f6rte, but she was kidnapped shortly thereafter in a Merkit raid. Tem\u00fcjin gathered 20,000 warriors and enlisted the help of his blood brother Jamukha and Toghrul, the khan of the Keraites. Together they helped Tem\u00fcjin get back B\u00f6rte. It's not clear how she was returned or whether a military action was involved in the process. One version of events claim the combined forces routed the Merkit and she was rescued along with much booty, but this could have been a composite narrative combining a later military action with an earlier event. B\u00f6rte gave birth soon afterwards and although the child may have been fathered by a Merkit, Tem\u00fcjin decided to raise him as his own anyway, naming him Jochi. The period of Tem\u00fcjin's life from 1177 to 1191 is largely unknown except that Tem\u00fcjin often fought the Taichiud, Salji'ut, Khadagin, and Tatars with mixed results. One of the clans following Tem\u00fcjin eventually left and was defeated by the Taichiud, after which they joined Jamukha. During the 1180s there was a drought in Mongolia which increased conflict between the tribes but Tem\u00fcjin only played a limited part in these affairs. ===Attack on the Merkit (1191)=== The previous attack on the Merkit that resulted in the rescue of B\u00f6rte may have been a separate campaign that occurred in 1191, and was confused in the sources. In 1191, Jamukha, Tem\u00fcjin, and Toghrul and his brother Jakha Gambhu decided to attack the Merkit. However Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul were late to the rendezvous area by three days, which greatly angered Jamukha. Together the 40,000 strong allied forces made a detour east to attack the enemy camp from the north-east. A fisherman spotted them and warned the Merkit of the impending attack, but the Merkit failed to make the necessary preparations, and dispersed. ===Battle of Dalan Baljut (1193)=== Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha stayed together for a while after the battle. At one point they sent an embassy to the Khadagin and Salji'ut to try to win them over against the Taichiud. In 1193, Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha split when retainers of the two camps clashed over horse thievery. Tem\u00fcjin took with him 41 tribal leaders and 10,000 men from Jamukha and was elected khan by his followers in the following days. The Taichiud became frightened by Tem\u00fcjin's power and joined Jamukha. In 1193, Jamukha assembled 30,000 men and moved in an arc from the north to flank Tem\u00fcjin's position. The two forces were evenly matched but Tem\u00fcjin's side suffered slightly worse than Jamukha, and was forced to retreat to a defensible pass called Jerene near the Onon River. Despite Jamukha's victory, his harsh treatment of captives disgusted his allies so much that they defected to Tem\u00fcjin, bringing with them 10,000 men. With less than 20,000 men at his side, Jamukha was no longer able to challenge Tem\u00fcjin on the upper Kherlen River, and retreated further east. ==Rise to power== Tem\u00fcjin allies with the Jurchen Jin dynasty against the Tatars while the Naimans take advantage of the situation to attack Tem\u00fcjin, 1196. Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul drive the Merkits further north and attack the Naimans to the west, 1199 Buyruq khan assembles a large coalition against Tem\u00fcjin but the attack fails, 1202-1203 ===Initial victory over the Tatars (1195-1196)=== In 1195, the Jurchen Jin dynasty allied with the Tatars to attack the Khongirad. The resulting military operation was a success but the Tatar leader, Zuxu, quarrelled over the distribution of loot. Breakdown of communication led to a Jin attack on the Tatars in the following year. The Jin general Wanyan Xiang sent a vanguard detachment under Wanyan Anguo toward the Kherlen River, where they held off Tatar forces for three days before the main body of the Jin army arrived and defeated them. The Khongirad had not forgotten their previous conflicts. On 4 February 1196, they struck deep into Jin territory and defeated a Jin detachment. Meanwhile, the Tatars fleeing Jin forces were intercepted by Toghrul and Tem\u00fcjin. The beleaguered Tatars chose to fight in a makeshift barricade instead of on the open field, probably because they were much weaker than the opposing force. The resulting melee resulted in the complete defeat of the Tatars. Toghrul and Tem\u00fcjin later met with Jin officials, who were extremely pleased with the destruction of the Tatars, and awarded them with titles. One of the Jin officials, a Khitan by the name of Yel\u00fc Ahai, was so impressed with Tem\u00fcjin, that he and his brother Tuhua later defected to him in 1203. Soon after the defeat of the Tatars, Toghrul was overthrown by his brother Erke Qara, who was backed by Inanch Bilge khan of the Naimans. A Naiman force entered Keraite territory and attacked Tem\u00fcjin's camp, causing some damage. Toghrul fled to the Qara Khitai. The defeated Tatar Zuxu submitted to the Jin and rebelled again in the same year. Zuxu submitted to the Jin again in 1198 and died soon afterward. Wanyan Xiang ordered the construction of extensive defensive works to protect sedentary population in the north. No further Jin campaigns against the steppe nomads were carried out with the same success as that of 1196. ===Consolidating power (1196-1199)=== Threatened by the Naimans' increasing influence, Tem\u00fcjin sought help from the Jurkins to conduct a joint expedition against the Naimans. The Jurkins responded by killing Tem\u00fcjin's envoys. Tem\u00fcjin attacked them in 1196 and subjugated the majority of the Jurkins, including Muqali, who would later become one of the Mongol Empire's foremost generals. Toghrul's brother Erke Qara also joined Tem\u00fcjin after he helped him drive off the Merkit. In 1197, Toghrul returned and re-established himself as leader of the Keraites with the help of Tem\u00fcjin. In the winter of 1197\u20138, Tem\u00fcjin eliminated the remaining Jurkins and executed their leaders. From 1198 to 1199, Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul preyed on the Merkit, driving them ever furthern north. Toghrul chose not to share the booty with Tem\u00fcjin, which upset him greatly. ===Confronting the Naimans (1199)=== Inanch Bilge khan died in 1198, splitting the Naimans between his two sons Tayang khan and Buyruq khan. In 1199, Tem\u00fcjin, Toghrul, and Jamukha attacked Buyruq west of the Altai Mountains. Alarmed by the eastern invaders, Tayang sent a force under K\u00f6kse Sabraq, which intercepted Toghrul and took half his people hostage. Tem\u00fcjin sent Muqali, Borokhula, Chilaun, and Bo'orchu to support the Keraites. They arrived in time to turn the tide of battle and routed the Naimans. Despite the victory in battle, the allied forces moved further east, possibly out of fear that the two Naiman factions might recoup and unite against them. ===Defeating the Tatars and Naimans (1200-1202)=== In 1200, Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul migrated eastwards along the Onon River into Taichiud territory and defeated the Taichiud in battle. Tem\u00fcjin chased the fleeing Taichiud to a river crossing where he was surprised by a sudden counterattack that wounded him. The battle continued the next day until the Taichiud had been defeated. Next, the Khadagin, Salji'ut, Dorben, Tatar, and Khongirad tribes formed a coalition against Tem\u00fcjin. The two sides engaged in a heavily contested battle that ended in retreat for Toghrul and Tem\u00fcjin. While Toghrul was incapacitated for two years, Tem\u00fcjin recovered his losses and returned to wage war on the Tatars and Dorben while his brother Qasar attacked the Khongirad. Tem\u00fcjin's enemies, especially, the Khongirad, then gathered around Jamukha and named him gur-khan in opposition to Tem\u00fcjin. Jamukha's forces suffered a defeat against Tem\u00fcjin in 1201, resulting in a brief defection by the Khongirad before they returned to fighting Tem\u00fcjin the next year. In 1202, Tem\u00fcjin introduced new rules for distributing plunder. Several of his relatives disagreed with the new way of distribution and left with 10,000 men. In the same year Tem\u00fcjin finished mopping up the Tatars. He intended to have all the Tatar captives executed, probably in revenge for his father, but his brother half-brother Belgutai leaked the information to the prisoners, who broke away and barricaded themselves on a hill. Tem\u00fcjin's brother Qasar, whose wife was Tatar, also hid 500 captives who were supposed to be killed. Buyruq khan assembled a large coalition army including even Jamukha and the Oirats numbering 70,000 strong. Together they advanced on Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul's position at Buir Lake. Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul moved their forces behind the Jin defensive fortifications. Both sides' forces were scattered and the weather took a turn for the worse with heavy snows and wind blasting the battlefield. Buryuq decided to retreat but got stuck in an open field at one point. The coalition army fell into confusion. Jamukha took the opportunity to plunder his allies' baggage. This came to be known as the Battle of K\u00f6yiten. ==Defeating rivals== Toghrul attacks Tem\u00fcjin with initial success, but his allies betray him, and the situation is reversed, 1203 Tem\u00fcjin defeats Tayang khan's Naimans, 1204-1205 Genghis Khan finishes off the Merkits and Naimans, 1206-1208 ===Toghrul's betrayal (1203)=== Toghrul's son Sengg\u00fcm convinced his father to turn on Tem\u00fcjin. They planned to ambush him while he was on his way to a wedding between the two families to cement their alliance, but a Keraite warned Tem\u00fcjin beforehand and spoiled their plan. A battle ensued with Toghrul and Jamukha taking the offensive by attacking Qasar and defeating his army. Qasar escaped but most of his family was captured. Next they advanced on Tem\u00fcjin, surprising him from the south, but Tem\u00fcjin managed to move to a smaller enclosure to nullify the enemy's superior numbers. Sengg\u00fcm was wounded in battle, throwing his forces into confusion, and allowing Tem\u00fcjin to retreat. Toghrul decided not to give chase and returned to camp. This came to be known as the Battle of Qalaqaljit Sands. Jamukha and a large portion of Toghrul's allies decided to split from him. When Toghrul caught wind of this, he attacked them, and some of them defected to Tem\u00fcjin. By autumn of 1203, the situation between the two sides had been reversed, Tem\u00fcjin's forces numbered more than 40,000 while Toghrul had barely half of that. Tem\u00fcjin scouted out Toghrul's camp under false pretenses of defection by Qasar. When Toghrul's location had been ascertained, Tem\u00fcjin's army rode through the night and surrounded the Keraite camp. The Keraites fought for three days before they surrendered. Toghrul fled the battle only to be killed by a Naiman called Qori S\u00fcbe\u010di who did not believe his identity. Sengg\u00fcm fled to Western Xia. ===Defeating Tayang khan (1204)=== Jamukha, the Merkits, and Keraites joined Tayang khan's Naimans in opposing Tem\u00fcjin. By this time, Tem\u00fcjin had 66,000 fighting men and moved most of them west in May 1204 to confront Tayang. Supposedly Naiman scouts were unimpressed with the quality of Tem\u00fcjin's troops, but Tayang wanted to retreat beyond the Altai Mountains to fight a war of attrition. Tayang's son Kuchlug as well as his senior officer argued against it and convinced Tayang to take the offensive against Tem\u00fcjin. The opposition coalition forces crossed the Orkhon River but fell back to the foot of a mountain upon encountering Tem\u00fcjin's forces. Tem\u00fcjin ordered his army to stand in \"lake\" battle formation and to fight a \"chisel\" battle. His army dispersed in a long line as if to outflank the Naimans, which the Naimans responded by dispersing their own forces as well. Having deceived the Naimans into believing that he was going for a flanking maneuver, Tem\u00fcjin led a frontal assault followed by the main army led by Qasar, driving the Naimans back to a mountain. Jamukha deserted the Naimans, who rejected Tem\u00fcjin's offer of surrender and fought for another day until they were all killed. Tayang fell in battle. Kuchlug had been left to defend a rear camp. When Tem\u00fcjin's army came upon him, Kuchlug fled with a few followers. Jamukha was caught soon afterward, delivered to Tem\u00fcjin, and executed. ===Defeating Toqtoa (1205)=== Toqtoa's Merkits fled southwest of Khovd and moved even further west when Tem\u00fcjin moved against him. Toqtoa and Kuchlug joined Buyruq khan west of the Altai. The Uvas Merkits tried to defect to Tem\u00fcjin, but Tem\u00fcjin considered them too weak to be of use and did not want to integrate them, so they rebelled and took some supplies with them. The other Merkits either surrendered or were killed by 1205. One of the captured was T\u00f6regene, who married \u00d6gedei. She became regent of the Mongol Empire when her husband died in 1241. ===Raiding Western Xia (1205)=== In April 1205, Tem\u00fcjin made his first major incursion on a non-Mongol power, the Western Xia. The Khitan, Yel\u00fc Ahai, who defected to Tem\u00fcjin some years ago led the way, ostensibly in search for Senggum, Toghrul's son. The Xia armies dared not fight the Mongols on the open field and made no move against them. The Mongols moved unopposed, plundering the open country, and destroying a few fortifications. After they left in June, the Xia rebuilt the places destroyed. In December a counter-raid was organized by the Xia but ultimately no attack was made. Soon after Senggum was killed in battle. ==Genghis Khan (1206)== In the summer of 1206, the shaman Kokochu proclaimed Tem\u00fcjin Genghis Khan (Chinggis Khan), the \"Universal Ruler\", at the Onon River. Genghis reorganized Mongol society into a military force based on units of a thousand known as mingghan. These were not only military units but also household units and used for taxation purposes. His family members, the altan urugh or Golden Kin, were given territory and assigned these mingghan. A 10,000 strong bodyguard unit known as the keshig was formed from the sons of commanders to ensure their loyalty to Genghis. In the winter, Genghis ambushed Buyruq while he was out hawking and killed him. Toqtoa and Kuchlug fled up along the Erdis River. In 1207, Genghis sent his son Jochi to subdue the Oirats and Kyrgyz people west of Lake Baikal. They submitted voluntarily, adding 20,000 warriors to the Mongol army. ==References== ==Bibliography== * . * * * * (alk. paper) * * * * * * (paperback). * * * * . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1162 establishments in Asia Category:1206 disestablishments in Asia Category:History of the Mongol Empire Category:Rises to prominence by individual Category:Genghis Khan Category:Military campaigns ",
