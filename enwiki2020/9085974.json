    "text": "The Fairbridge Festival is a music festival held annually since 1993 at Fairbridge village near Pinjarra in Western Australia. The festival is held over a weekend in April. Visitors staying for the whole weekend can camp in the surrounding fields in tents or vans. The festival offers options for those who don't have their own camping equipment in the form of \"Cosy Camping\" and \"Glamping\". Day tickets are also available. The event takes place over three days and three nights (Friday to Sunday), across 12 stages, which include marquees, a chapel, dance stage and workshop rooms. The program features a variety of musical genres such as blues, roots, Celtic, folk, dance, a cappella and world music as well as acts and activities specifically catering for children and young people. Fairbridge Festival has experienced steady audience growth with the 2016 tally of about 15,000 day attendees. The most common patrons are families, but Fairbridge Festival is enjoyed by all ages including teenagers, young adults and the young at heart. The 2017 Fairbridge Festival celebrated the festival's 25th anniversary, and part of these celebrations include an extended four-day event: 21\u201324 April 2017. The next festival is scheduled for 26\u201328 April 2019. ==History== The Festival was established by Max Klubal and Sally Grice, who at the time were committee members of the Western Australian Folk Federation (WAFF). WAFF already ran a folk festival at Toodyay and formed a partnership with the organisation Parents for Music to run the festival at Fairbridge Village, in Pinjarra, with the intention of making it a more family-orientated event than Toodyay. The two festivals continued concurrently for two years but eventually the Toodyay festival ceased. In 1996, Fairbridge Festival disassociated itself from WAFF to its present status as an incorporated not-for-profit association. In 2006, a board of management was incorporated into Fairbridge Festival headed up by a president. During this time, a general manager was also appointed to lead the growing Festival Operations Group. who were mainly volunteers. Up until this point the president, Wendy Corrick, had managed the event. Fairbridge Festival and the organisation, Fairbridge WA, were often confused, particularly in relation to invoicing and accounting matters. Fairbridge WA manages Fairbridge Village, the site of the Fairbridge Festival. To help distinguish the organisations, in November 2011, the incorporation changed its name from Fairbridge Festival Inc. to FolkWorld Inc. This change also better reflects the role of FolkWorld Inc. as the premier peak organisation supporting and promoting Folk Music in Western Australia. Until 2014, Steve Barnes was the artistic director, in charge of programming the festival. Rod Vervest took over as artistic director in 2015. Fairbridge Festival's program is guided by its constitution: \u201cFolkWorld Inc. is dedicated to promoting traditional, contemporary and multicultural folk music, dance and related performing arts, with particular emphasis on the involvement of families.\u201d Overall festival programming is contributed to by several festival programmers, including a Children's Program Director, Youth Program Director and a Dance Program Director. In 2012, the Fairbridge Festival Quest songwriting competition for high school-aged young people was launched and has been unearthing new talent from across Western Australia every year. The 2017 Ben Elton film Three Summers is set at a fictional folk festival in Fairbridge which is called 'Westival', but is inspired by and based on the Fairbridge Festival. Ben Elton is a Patron of FolkWorld Inc. Donations are invited to help support and contribute to the future of Fairbridge Festival and other FolkWorld Inc. initiatives. Donations of $2 or over are tax deductible. The next Fairbridge Festival is scheduled for 26\u201328 April 2019. ==Site== The festival site was originally Fairbridge School, a combination of orphanage, farm school and Imperial social engineering project set up as part of a colonial vision by Kingsley Fairbridge in 1912. The school was founded with the mission of taking deprived children from the orphanages (such as Dr. Barnardo's Homes) and streets of Britain and giving them a healthy life in the Colonies, (while ensuring that the Colonies continued to be populated with sound Anglo-Saxon stock, as was the prevailing ethos of the time), the school functioned until the early 1960s. ==2018== The 2019 festival will be held 26\u201328 April 2019. ==2017== The 2017 festival was held 21\u201324 April.
