    "text": "Gender inequality in Venezuela is still an issue in the country despite measures aimed at curbing discrimination. ==Statistics== ===Labor=== In labor participation, the involvement of women raised from 17.5% in 1950 to 43.0% in 1998. This included married Venezuelan women who were able to dedicate less time to the workforce due to the traditional standards of establishing a family. ==Law== Under the Luis Herrera Campins administration, the Venezuelan government focused on revamping the nation's \"family law\". On 16 July 1982, the Congress of Venezuela approved changes to the law which granted Venezuelan women and equal power to their husband for making family decisions as well as the power to divorce their partner if they committed adultery. Previously, Venezuelan law stated that a wife \"must follow her husband wherever he decides to live\" and that the \"husband shall make all decisions related to married life\". ==References== Venezuela Category:Discrimination in Venezuela ",
