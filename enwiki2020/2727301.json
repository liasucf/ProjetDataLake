    "text": "Andr\u00e9 Obey (; 8 May 1892 at Douai, France \u2013 11 April 1975 at Montsoreau, near the Loire River) was a prominent French playwright during the inter-war years, and into the 1950s. He began as a novelist and produced an autobiographical novel about his adolescence le Joueur de triangle (The Triangle Player). After his meeting with Jacques Copeau, he devoted himself completely to dramatic works. In 1945 Obey became provisional general administrator of the Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise. He was made full general administrator in 1946, and resigned in 1947 after just under a year's service. Obey's play Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce was drawn on by Ronald Duncan for the libretto of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. Obey served as general administrator of the Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise, in a provisional capacity from October 1945 until 6 April 1946, then with full powers until his resignation on 5 February 1947. ==BibliographyDictionnaire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise contemporaine, Andr\u00e9 BOURIN et Jean ROUSSELOT, Librairie Larousse, Paris, 1966.== ===Novels=== *Le joueur de triangle (The Triangle Player)/ 1928 ===Theatre=== * No\u00e9 (Noah)/ 1930: Broadway February 13, 1935 - March 1935 * Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce (The Rape of Lucretia)/ 1931: Broadway December 20, 1932 - January 1933 * La Bataille de la Marne (The Battle of the Marne)/ 1932 * La Souriante Madame Beudet (The Smiling Madame Beudet)/ 1921: Broadway November 28, 1921 - December 1921 * La Carcasse (The Carcass)/ 1926 * Lazare (Lazarus)/ 1950 * L'Orestie/ 1955 * Les trois coups de minuit/ 1957: English translation as Frost at Midnight by Warren Tute * Revenu de l'\u00e9toile (Returned from the star)/ 1965 ==Reviews== * == References == Category:1892 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Douai Category:20th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:Prix Renaudot winners Category:Administrators of the Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise Category:20th-century French novelists Category:French male novelists Category:20th-century French male writers ",
