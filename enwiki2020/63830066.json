Petras described the song as a \"return to color, the feeling of being in love, and the escapism pop that I love the most\". Petras also revealed that she \"had cried all [her] tears [in the last single, 'Reminds Me' and album, Clarity] and moved on, so this is a reflection of how [she's] been feeling\". The song was included in the expansion pack The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle with new vocals in Simlish, the fictional language spoken by Sims. ==Composition== Petras described the track as a \"pick-me-up pop song\" which displays a \"punchy mix of synth-bass squirts and tropical-funk guitar that lives up to its namesake\". ==Reception== Desiree Guerrero from Out wrote that the track \"might be the song of the summer\", describing the song as \"glittery, sugary, summery\" which is \"giving us all the fantasy pop escapism we need right now\". ==Music video== Petras released the song's music video on May 11, 2020 and was filmed in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It features Paris Hilton, Demi Lovato, Jonathan Van Ness, Madelaine Petsch, Todrick Hall, Pabllo Vittar, Jessie J, Charli XCX, Aly & AJ, Scott Hoying, Aquaria, Loren Gray, Nikita Dragun, Amanda Lepore, Dorian Electra, Bowen Yang, Slayyyter, and Teddy Quinlivan as cameo appearances. ==Live performances== Petras performed \"Malibu\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 10 July 2020. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Singles Breakers (OCC) | 15 |} == References == Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Kim Petras songs Category:Songs written by Dr. Luke Category:Songs written by Kim Petras ",
