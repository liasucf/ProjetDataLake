    "text": "Trapa-Trapa Formation () is a volcano-sedimentary formation of Miocene age in south-central Chile and nearby parts of Argentina. The largest outcrops lie in the Andes, while the Chilean Central Valley host some of the smaller outcrops. The volcanic rocks of the formation are of calc-alkaline character, and are less silicic than contemporary volcanic rocks found further north in the Farellones Formation. == References == Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Miocene Series of South America Category:Miocene volcanism Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Neogene Chile Category:Tuff formations Category:Geology of Araucan\u00eda Region Category:Geology of Biob\u00edo Region Category:Geology of Maule Region Category:Geology of Neuqu\u00e9n Province ",
