    "text": "Marga is a term in Batak societies referring to a clan name. The term is derived either from the Sanskrit varga, meaning company, party, or group, or, more likely,http://www.kitlv- journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874 from the Sanskrit marga, meaning 'road, way or path', referring to a people of 'one origin'. Batak marga are patrilineal. Marriage in the same marga is strictly forbidden by tribal law (adat) even between people only distantly related; but it is allowed and often even arranged between cousins of the maternal line (boru). After marriage, Batak women do not change their family (marga) name, but add \"boru\" to their birth name. Since Batak marga are patrilineal, the children will inherit the marga from their father. In Batak Toba mythology, marga are traced to the common ancestor \"Si Raja Batak\" (The King of the Batak). In Karo mythology, the five marga (Merga Silima) are defined in terms of matrimonial bonds, with no importance placed on a common ancestor myth. Simalungun have four basic marga, each seen as equal, and likewise with no common ancestor myth. ==Examples of marga== This is some examples of Batak surnames with articles in English Wikipedia: * Batubara: Adam Malik Batubara (3rd Vice President of Indonesia), Cosmas Batubara (former minister during Suharto era) * Datubara: Alfred Gonti Pius Datubara (archbishop) * Ginting: Lyodra Ginting (singer), Anthony Sinisuka Ginting (badminton player) * Girsang: Manampin Girsang (furniture entrepreneur) * Gultom: Ivan Doly Gultom (politician), Gloria Jessica Ulima Gultom (singer) * Harahap: Burhanuddin Harahap (politician), Amir Sjarifoeddin Harahap (communist activist) * Hasibuan: Anniesa Hasibuan (fashion designer and fraudster) * Hutagalung: Nadya Hutagalung (Indonesian-Australian model and actress), Jesse Hutagalung (Dutch tennis player) * Hutahaean: Ramlan Hutahaean (Protestant clergyman) * Hutapea: Hotman Paris Hutapea (lawyer) * Hutauruk: Berlian Hutauruk (singer) * Kaban: Malam Sambat Kaban (minister) * Lubis: Umar Lubis (actor), Todung Mulya Lubis (advocate and activist), Fatin Shidqia Lubis (singer) * (Lumban) Tobing: Ferdinand Lumbantobing (physician), Joy Tobing (Indonesian singer), Darwin Lumbantobing (Protestant clergyman) * Malau: Yoseph Malau (footballer) * Manik: El Manik (actor) * Marbun: Timothy Marbun (TV presenter) * Marpaung: Novita Dewi Marpaung (singer) * Nababan: Putra Nababan (politician) * Nainggolan: Radja Nainggolan (Belgian footballer), Alfoncius Dapot Parulian \"Cas Alfonso\" Nainggolan (singer) * Nasution: Abdul Haris Nasution (Indonesian Army general), Darmin Nasution (economist), Adnan Buyung Nasution (lawyer), Diana Nasution (singer), Prisia Nasution (model and actress), Bobby Nasution (Joko Widodo's son-in-law), Kaharuddin Nasution (governor and lieutenant- general), Anneth Delliecia Nasution (singer), Saifuddin Nasution (Malaysian minister), Sholeh Mahmoed Nasution (Muslim televangelist) * Pakpahan: Muchtar Pakpahan (labour activist) * Pane: Armijn Pane (writer) * Panggabean: Maraden Panggabean (general and politician), Mahyadi Panggabean (footballer) * Panjaitan: D.
