    "text": "In mathematics, the Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality is a result on the geometry of triangles in the Euclidean plane. It states that if a triangle in the plane has side lengths a, b and c and area T, then :a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} \\geq (a - b)^{2} + (b - c)^{2} + (c - a)^{2} + 4 \\sqrt{3} T \\quad \\mbox{(HF)}. ==Related inequalities== * Weitzenb\u00f6ck's inequality is a straightforward corollary of the Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality: if a triangle in the plane has side lengths a, b and c and area T, then :a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} \\geq 4 \\sqrt{3} T \\quad \\mbox{(W)}. Weitzenb\u00f6ck's inequality can also be proved using Heron's formula, by which route it can be seen that equality holds in (W) if and only if the triangle is an equilateral triangle, i.e. a = b = c. * A version for quadrilateral: Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with the lengths a, b, c, d and the area T then:Leonard Mihai Giugiuc, Dao Thanh Oai and Kadir Altintas, An inequality related to the lengths and area of a convex quadrilateral, International Journal of Geometry, Vol. 7 (2018), No. 1, pp. 81 - 86, : a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 \\ge 4T + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sum{(a-b)^2} with equality only for a square. Where \\sum{(a-b)^2}=(a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(a-d)^2+(b-c)^2+(b-d)^2+(c-d)^2 ==History== The Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality is named after , who also published in the same paper the Finsler\u2013Hadwiger theorem on a square derived from two other squares that share a vertex. ==See also== *List of triangle inequalities *Isoperimetric inequality ==References== * *Claudi Alsina, Roger B.
