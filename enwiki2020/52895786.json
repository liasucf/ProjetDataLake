In addition to being a Texas Senator, Buckingham is an oculoplastic and reconstructive surgeon. ==Background== Buckingham is a seventh generation Texan. Buckingham grew up in the Dallas suburb of Rockwall, Texas, before moving to Austin. She attended Westlake High School. She attended college at the University of Texas at Austin, and medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. Buckingham is married to Ed Buckingham; they are both practicing physicians. Buckingham was a school board member of the Lake Travis Independent School District from 2014 to 2015. She was also an appointee to the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission and the vice chair of the Texas State Board for Educator Certification. ==Political career== ===2016 Texas Senate election=== The district stretches from the Austin suburbs in Travis County, West to Texas Hill Country, and North to Abilene covering roughly 20,000 square miles of territory. Buckingham was one of six candidates in the Republican primary to replace retiring state senator Troy Fraser. Buckingham portrayed herself as a political outsider and was endorsed by former governor Rick Perry. In the March 1, 2016, primary she received 25% of the vote, with state representative Susan King of Abilene receiving 27% of the vote. Because neither candidate received a majority, they advanced to a runoff election in May. After a contentious campaign focusing on the records and geographic profiles of the two candidates, Buckingham won the runoff with over 60% of the vote. In the November general election, Buckingham faced Democratic nominee Virginia \u201cJennie Lou\u201d Leeder of Llano. Buckingham won with over 70% of the vote. ===Texas Senate career=== Buckingham filed her first bill to subject faithless presidential electors to a civil penalty of $5,000 and to bar them from being electors in the future. The American Conservative Union has given her a 96% lifetime rating. ==References== ==External links== *Official campaign website *Official legislative website Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Texas state senators Category:Texas Republicans Category:People from Lakeway, Texas Category:People from Rockwall, Texas Category:Women state legislators in Texas Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni Category:University of Texas Medical Branch alumni Category:American ophthalmologists Category:Physicians from Texas Category:School board members in Texas Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:Women ophthalmologists ",
