During the Soviet era, OKBs were closed institutions working on design and prototyping of advanced technology, usually for military applications. A bureau was officially identified by a number, and often semi-officially by the name of its lead designer \u2013 for example, OKB-51 was led by Pavel Sukhoi, and it eventually became known as the OKB of Sukhoi. Successful and famous bureaus often retained this name even after the death or replacement of their designers. These relatively small state-run organisations were not intended for the mass production of aircraft, rockets, or other vehicles or equipment which they designed. However, they usually had the facilities and resources to construct prototypes. Designs accepted by the state were then assigned to factories for mass production. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many OKBs became Scientific Production Organizations (\u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) abbreviated to NPO. There were some attempts to merge them in the 1990s, and there were widespread amalgamations in 2001\u20132006 to create \"national champions\", such as Almaz-Antey to consolidate SAM development. == OKBs in aerospace industry == * KB-1 \u2013 NPO Almaz, Vitaly Shabanov * OKB-1 \u2013 Korolev (today RSC Energia) * OKB-1 \u2013 Dr. Brunolf Baade disbanded by 1953 * OKB-2 \u2013 early name of MKB Raduga (OKB-155-2) * OKB-3 \u2013 Bratukhin * OKB-4 \u2013 Matus Bisnovat's Design Bureau (differ from NPO Molniya) * OKB-8 \u2013 Novator (long-range SAMs) * OKB-19 \u2013 Shvetsov, Soloviev.
