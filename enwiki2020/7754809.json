Later it was upgraded to a tambon and changed to be controlled by Mueang Ra- ngae. Tambon Manalo grew bigger, so the government moved the city hall from Tambon Tanyong Mat to Manalo. Then they upgraded Tambon Manalo to Mueang Bang Nara. King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) renamed the city Narathiwat in 1915, however in 1917 the district was renamed from Mueang to the old name, Bang Nara. In 1938 the district name was changed to Mueang Narathiwat District. ==Geography== Neighboring districts are (from the southeast clockwise): Tak Bai, Cho-airong, Ra-ngae, Yi-ngo, and Bacho of Narathiwat Province; Mai Kaen of Pattani Province and the Gulf of Thailand. The important water resource is the Bang Nara River. Ao Manao-Khao Tanyong National Park is in the district. ==Administration== The district is divided into seven sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 57 villages (mubans). The town (thesaban mueang) Narathiwat covers parts of tambon Bang Nak. The six remaining tambons are each led by a tambon administrative organization (TAO). {| ! No. ! Name ! Thai name ! Villages !
