    "text": "Yelena Grigoryeva (1977/1978 \u2013 July 21, 2019) was a human rights, and LGBTQ rights activist. She also opposed the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. She was murdered in St. Petersburg, Russia on 21 July 2019 after being stabbed and strangled to death by unknown assailants. Grigoryeva's identifying information had appeared in July on a website by a group calling themselves \u2018Saw\u2019 after the American horror film franchise. The group encouraged readers to hunt, kidnap and murder a list of LGBTQ+ people. Saw's website was blocked in Russia but a new list of LGBTQ+ activists, journalists and citizens are circulating on social media apps and messaging apps in the country, still encouraging others to murder LGBTQ+ people in Russia. ==References== == External links == * Polizei wertet Mord an LGBT-Aktivistin als \"pers\u00f6nlichen Konflikt\".
