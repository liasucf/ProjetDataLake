It also covers Virginia and South Carolina. ==History== The station began as WITN-FM, and by the late 1970s was a Top 40 station known as Rock 93, airing TM's automated \"Stereo Rock\" format. The station was owned by William Riley \"Bill\" Roberson Jr. and operated along with sister station WITN-AM as the Tar Heel Broadcasting System. Roberson also owned the local TV station, WITN- TV 7 and numerous other local properties such as the Dr. Pepper bottling plant, and Washington Square Mall. Around 1984, Roberson retired and began divesting these properties, selling some but leaving his son in law, Charles Zoph Potts and William Riley Roberson III in charge of WITN-AM and FM. Potts and Roberson took the FM station to a live format in 1985, and changed to the 93DLX moniker, also known as the Hot FM. In 1991 the station went to a soft AC format. On 2/19/96 the calls became WERO. and went to Classic Hits format as Arrow 93.3. Also in 1996, major changes took place as Potts and Roberson sold their interest in the station to Pinnacle Broadcasting, which in 1999 became NextMedia Group. In 1998 it dropped the Arrow and became known as WERO a 50-50 mix of the 80s and 90s, mixing in more of an AAA format, all during this time it had some association with WITN-TV. In 1999 it switched to Bob 93.3 and plays Top 40 music. In 2004, NextMedia consolidated its radio operations to one central location in New Bern, North Carolina, as this station left behind the building just south of Washington where it had broadcast from since the 1950s.
