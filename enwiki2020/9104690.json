    "text": "In descriptive set theory, a set S is said to be homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a homogeneous tree. S is said to be \\kappa-homogeneously Suslin if it is the projection of a \\kappa-homogeneous tree. If A\\subseteq{}^\\omega\\omega is a \\mathbf{\\Pi}_1^1 set and \\kappa is a measurable cardinal, then A is \\kappa-homogeneously Suslin. This result is important in the proof that the existence of a measurable cardinal implies that \\mathbf{\\Pi}_1^1 sets are determined. ==See also== * Projective determinacy ==References== * Category:Descriptive set theory Category:Determinacy ",
