He was the first Chagatai Khan to convert to Islam.Rene Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes, New Brunswick 1970, p. 332 Upon the death of his father in 1252, Mubarak Shah succeeded him as Chagatai Khan, with his mother acting as regent. In 1260, however, the Great Khan claimant Ariq B\u00f6ke appointed Chagatai Khan's grandson Alghu, and by the following year Alghu had control over much of the Khanate. When Alghu revolted against Ariq B\u00f6ke in 1262, Ergene supported him. After Alghu died in 1266, Ergene enthroned Mubarak Shah as head of the ulus, without the permission of Kublai Khan, who was also proclaimed the Great Khan and defeated Ariq B\u00f6ke 2 years after. Kublai Khan, however, supported Baraq, a great-grandson of Chagatai. Baraq gained the loyalty of Mubarak Shah's army soon moved against him, exiling him that year.
