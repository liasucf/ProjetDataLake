Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals were led by first-year head coach Kermit Davis and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho. The Vandals were overall in the regular season and in conference play, co-champions in the standings with Boise State; the teams split their late- season series. At the conference tournament in Boise, the Vandals again earned a bye into the semifinals, where they beat Montana by 21 points. In the final against Boise State, Idaho defeated the host team by seven to earn their first NCAA berth in seven years. Seeded thirteenth in the West region, Idaho met fourth-seed #15 UNLV back in Boise and lost by twelve. ==Postseason result== |- !colspan=6 style=| Big Sky Tournament |- !colspan=6 style=| NCAA Tournament ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Idaho Vandals: 1988\u201389 basketball season *Gem of the Mountains: 1989 University of Idaho yearbook \u2013 1988\u201389 basketball season *Idaho Argonaut \u2013 student newspaper \u2013 1989 editions Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball seasons Idaho Idaho Idaho ",
