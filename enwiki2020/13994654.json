    "text": "Cobalt (III) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula of Co2O3. Although only two oxides of cobalt are well characterized, CoO and Co3O4, procedures claiming to give Co2O3 have been described. Thus treatment of Co(II) salts such as cobalt(II) nitrate with an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (also known as bleach) gives a black solid.Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. p. 1675. Some formulations of the catalyst hopcalite contain \"Co2O3\". ==See also== *Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles ==References== Category:Cobalt(III) compounds Category:Sesquioxides Category:Transition metal oxides ",
