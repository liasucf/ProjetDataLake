Spain has an embassy in Hanoi and Vietnam has an embassy in Madrid. ==History== Embassy of Vietnam in Madrid While two countries had its first contacts at 16th century with the spread of Catholic Jesuits from Spain to Vietnam, their first formal connection between two was only established at 19th century when Isabella II of Spain joined with Napoleon III of France together intervened against Vietnam following anti-Catholic persecutions in the country in 1858.
