    "text": "Melbourne Talk Radio (callsign 3MP) was a radio station in Melbourne that commenced broadcasting on 19 April 2010 until its closure on 2 March 2012. It replaced, and was later succeeded by, 3MP, which used the 1377 kHz frequency. The station's transmitter is located in the suburb of Rowville and broadcasts at 5 kW. ==History== In December 2009, existing operator Pacific Star Network and Macquarie Radio Network, the owner of top rating Sydney talkback radio station 2GB, agreed to create the joint-venture \"Melbourne Radio Operations Pty Ltd\", to supply radio programming in the Melbourne market. In April 2010, the two signed an interim agreement to launch conservative talkback station MTR 1377\u2014replacing 3MP on AM radio\u2014to compete against incumbent 3AW. At the station's launch on 7 April 2010, breakfast presenter and Program Director Steve Price promised the station would be \"in your face, controversial, opinionated\". The station's office was in Swan Street, Richmond, in the same location as its sister station, sports-focused SEN. ==Closure== In November 2011, MTR was threatened with closure due to several issues, both ratings and legally related. The station's ratings were much lower than anticipated and litigation is under way relating to program syndication from Sydney's 2GB. Russell Tate, CEO of Macquarie Radio Network which half owns the station, wanted the station to have a cheaper management and staff structure. The station lost $6.2 million in the first twelve months of operation. In February 2012 Macquarie Radio Network began legal action against Pacific Star after the board failed to approve a budget for the station. In March 2012, part owner, Macquarie Radio Network issued a notice of default to MTR and Pacific Star Network demanding full payment of all monies owing. The station was closed and placed into administration on Friday 2 March at 5pm. The original station that moved to digital only as 3MP MyMP when MTR began broadcasting, reoccupied the 1377 frequency. ==Former Presenters== * Breakfast with Steve Price * Mornings with Steve Vizard * Afternoons with Chris Smith (\u221e) * Drive with Luke Grant * Money News with Ross Greenwood (\u221e) * Nights with Brian Wilshire (\u221e) * Australia Overnight with Michael McLaren (\u221e) * Wake Up Australia with Andrew Moore (Mon\u2013Wed) & Luke Bona (Thurs & Fri) (\u221e) (\u221e) Aired also on 2GB in Sydney. * Jim Ball * Martin King * Glenn Ridge ==News== MTR 1377 broadcast 2GB's Macquarie National News from Sydney. The former Melbourne based newsroom was sacked in early December 2011 as part of a \"cost-cutting\" measure. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Melbourne Category:Defunct radio stations in Australia Category:News and talk radio stations in Australia Category:Radio stations established in 2010 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2012 Category:Nine Radio Category:2010 establishments in Australia Category:2012 disestablishments in Australia ",
