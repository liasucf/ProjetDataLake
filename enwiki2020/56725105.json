    "text": "Each year, the Southeastern Conference (SEC), a college athletic conference whose member institutions are located primarily in the Southern part of the United States, chooses Community Service Teams of players of various sports from among its member universities. The honor goes to players in recognition of their off-the-court/off-the-field volunteering and community service activities. The Community Service Team is meant to highlight an athlete from each SEC school in a variety of sports. The SEC began this concept with a football Community Service Team in 1994, originally called the Good Works team. The recognition has expanded to other sports over the years. Like an all-conference team or an all-American team, the Community Service Team is a hypothetical team - the members won't actually get together and play a game. The community service and volunteering the players engage in includes volunteering in schools and for local nonprofits and communities of faith, as well as in youth-focused programs at their respective universities. ==2018 Winners== 2018 SEC Men's Basketball Community Service Team: * Braxton Key, Alabama * Trey Thompson, Arkansas * Jared Harper, Auburn * Kevarrius Hayes, Florida * Yante Maten, Georgia * Dillon Pulliam, Kentucky * Aaron Epps, LSU * Terence Davis, Ole Miss * Mitchell Storm, Mississippi State * Jeremiah Tilmon, Missouri * Khadim Gueye, South Carolina * Grant Williams, Tennessee * Tonny Trocha-Morelos, Texas A&M;
