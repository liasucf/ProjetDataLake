    "text": "Salvador Ballesta Vialcho (born 22 May 1975), commonly known as Salva, is a Spanish former footballer who played as a striker, and the current manager of Algeciras CF. A goalscorer noted for his flair and workrate, he played for seven different top division clubs, most notably Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Valencia \u2013 with whom he won his sole team trophy \u2013 and M\u00e1laga. He amassed totals of 235 games and 86 goals over 11 La Liga seasons, adding 126 matches and 52 goals in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Off the field, Salva was known for his nationalistic and militarist viewpoints. ==Club career== Salva was born in Zaragoza, Aragon. After making his professional debuts with Sevilla FC, he won the Pichichi Trophy in the 1999\u20132000 season, scoring 27 goals to lead La Liga's scoring charts for Racing de Santander. He then moved to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (freshly relegated) and proceeded to lead the side with 21 successful strikes, although the Colchoneros did not return to the top level. Salva joined Valencia CF in summer 2001, netting five goals to help the side become league champions after a 31-year drought. He was rarely used in the following season, and was subsequently briefly part of the Bolton Wanderers squad that avoided Premier League relegation in 2003; he had another two loan stints from 2003 to 2005, with M\u00e1laga CF for which he netted 21 official goals, including a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 league home crushing of FC Barcelona on 3 December 2003, and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, being subsequently released and signing with the former. In late January 2007, Salva joined top flight strugglers Levante UD on loan from M\u00e1laga, now in the second division. On 4 February, he played his first league match for the club in an away win against Real Madrid, scoring the game's only goal; after the season's end, with the Valencians managing to retain their status, he returned to M\u00e1laga, and netted seven times to help to top division promotion. As he spent most of 2008\u201309 hampered by recurrent injuries, Salva was still able to contribute, notably coming from the bench against neighbours UD Almer\u00eda and helping turn the score from 0\u20132 to a 3\u20132 home win with two goals, on 8 February 2009. On 15 March, he added another brace against another neighbouring club, in a 2\u20132 home draw against former side Sevilla; when the season ended, he was released after his contract expired. In the dying hours of the 2009 August transfer window, Salva signed a 1+1 contract with Albacete Balompi\u00e9, aged 34. However, at the end of his first season, where he appeared almost exclusively as a backup, he was one of 14 players who were not given a contract extension, being released and retiring shortly after; subsequently he re-joined former team M\u00e1laga as a youth coach, alongside former teammate Francesc Arnau. On 11 July 2013, Salva was appointed as the new manager of M\u00e1laga's reserves Atl\u00e9tico Malague\u00f1o, in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. He left two years later, as his contract was not renewed. Salva continued working in the lower leagues in the following seasons, with Real Ja\u00e9n and CD M\u00f3stoles URJC. ==International career== Salva played four matches with Spain, the first being a friendly against Poland on 26 January 2000, coming in for Ismael Urzaiz in the 70th minute of an eventual 3\u20130 win in Cartagena. ==Personal life== Off the pitch, Salva was notorious for his outspoken personality and his political beliefs, far to the right of most of his peers'. A nationalist who put his love for the \"fatherland\" over that for his own family, he displayed the nation's flag on his boots; when sent off for M\u00e1laga against CA Osasuna, whose fans include supporters of Basque independence, he shouted to them \"\u00a1Que viva Espa\u00f1a, hijos de puta!\" (Long live Spain, sons of bitches!). Fans of Basque team Real Sociedad displayed a banner reading \"Salva, mu\u00e9rete\" (Salva, die) when he visited their Anoeta Stadium, and he also had a dislike for Barcelona defender Oleguer Presas, an outspoken left-winger and proponent of Catalan independence, saying that he had more respect for \"dog crap\" than for him. Although his footballing idol was Real Madrid's Hugo S\u00e1nchez, Salva's other heroes included Francoist fighter pilot Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Morato, Luftwaffe aviator Hans-Ulrich Rudel and Antonio Tejero, leader of the failed \"23-F\" right-wing coup. A self-declared Christian, he considered himself apolitical. Born to a family with a military background, Salva stated that he would be the first to serve in the Iraq War if conscripted by prime minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. He was a patron of his hometown's military helicopter school. In February 2013, Salva learnt that he was being turned down for the assistant coach job at RC Celta de Vigo over his political views. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"8\"|Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=left|M\u00e1laga B | |align=left|12 July 2013 |align=left|1 June 2015 | |- |align=left|Ja\u00e9n | |align=left|26 September 2017 |align=left|22 February 2018 | |- |align=left|M\u00f3stoles | |align=left|19 June 2018 |align=left|26 June 2019 | |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total !\u2014 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Valencia *La Liga: 2001\u201302 ===International=== Spain U21 *UEFA European Under-21 Championship: 1998 ===Individual=== *Pichichi Trophy: 1999\u20132000 *Pichichi Trophy (Segunda Divisi\u00f3n): 2000\u201301 ==References== ==External links== * * CiberChe biography and stats * * * Spain stats at Eu-Football Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish Christians Category:Sportspeople from Zaragoza Category:Spanish footballers Category:Aragonese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:\u00c9cija Balompi\u00e9 players Category:Racing de Santander players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:Valencia CF players Category:M\u00e1laga CF players Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Albacete Balompi\u00e9 players Category:Premier League players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Pichichi Trophy winners Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spain under-23 international footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Real Ja\u00e9n managers ",
