The tournament was played at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California during May 1987. UCLA defeated rival USC in the final match, 3\u20130 (15\u201311, 15\u20132, 16\u201314), to win their 12th national title. The Bruins (38\u20133) were coached by Al Scates. UCLA's Ozzie Volstad was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Volstad, along with six other players, also comprised the All-tournament team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
