    "text": "\u00c6thelstan Half-King (fl. 932 \u2013 956) was an important and influential Ealdorman of East Anglia who interacted with five kings of England, including his adopted son King Edgar the Peaceful. Many of \u00c6thelstan's close relatives were also involved in important affairs, but soon after the death of King Eadred in 955, he left his position and became a monk at Glastonbury Abbey. ==Origins== \u00c6thelstan was the son of \u00c6thelfrith an Ealdorman, who held lands in Somerset, Berkshire, and Middlesex.Henson, pp. 125 & 127; , retrieved 2007-01-28; Stenton, p. 351. His mother was \u00c6thelgyth, daughter of \u00c6thelwulf., retrieved 2007-01-28 His brothers \u00c6lfstan, \u00c6thelwald, and \u00c6dric or Eadric, were Ealdormen of Mercia, of Kent, and of Wessex, respectively.Henson, pp. 125-127; Miller. The rise of \u00c6thelstan's family began in the reign of King Edward the Elder, when \u00c6thelfrith, whose family background is presumed to lie in Wessex, was appointed an Ealdorman in southern Mercia. Mercia was then ruled by Edward's sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and her husband \u00c6thelred. ==Career== \u00c6thelstan seems to have been appointed Ealdorman of East Anglia and other parts by King \u00c6thelstan in about 932. The lands King \u00c6thelstan gave him had mostly been part of the Danelaw which had only been forced out of the area after the Battle of Tempsford in Bedfordshire fifteen years earlier in 917. \u00c6thelstan's brother \u00c6lfstan became Ealdorman of some parts of Mercia at about the same time and both of them may have participated in King \u00c6thelstan's invasion of Scotland in 934. His other brothers, Eadric and \u00c6thelwald, were witnessing charters as Ealdormen by 940. \u00c6thelstan and his family were supporters of the monastic reforms of Saint Dunstan which introduced the Benedictine rule to Glastonbury. Both Glastonbury, and Abingdon Abbey, were endowed by \u00c6thelstan.Higham, p. 4; Williams. \u00c6thelstan's wife was named \u00c6lfwynn. Her family came from the East Midlands. She was foster-mother of King Edgar of England. \u00c6lfwynn's lands would later endow Ramsey Abbey, refounded by Bishop \u00c6thelwold of Winchester, Bishop Oswald of Worcester, and \u00c6thelstan's son \u00c6thelwine. Byrhtferth of Ramsey, author of a Life of Saint Oswald in the early 11th century, devoted considerable space to \u00c6thelstan's family, several of whom were buried at Ramsey. The epithet Half-King comes from Byrhtferth's writings. Several members of the family were buried, or reburied, at Ramsey. The position of \u00c6thelstan and his brothers in the middle of the 10th century has been compared with the similar dominance of the family of Godwin, Earl of Wessex in the 11th century.Higham, p. 4; Miller; Williams. It is possible that \u00c6thelstan's withdrawal to Glastonbury may not have been voluntary.Higham, p. 4. However, the death of \u00c6thelwald in 962 resulted in the family's offices in Wessex passing to their chief rivals, the family of Ealdorman \u00c6lfhere. The result of this was that the two families were roughly equal in influence. \u00c6lfhere's death in the early 970s did not result in a return of the old dominance of \u00c6thelstan's family.Higham, pp. 5 & 68-69. ==Family== People associated with \u00c6thelstan's family include Ealdorman Byrhtnoth, whose defeat at the Battle of Maldon is commemorated in verse.Higham, p. 22. \u00c6thelstan's children included: * \u00c6thelwald (died c. 962), Ealdorman of Essex, then of East Anglia after his father became a monk. Queen \u00c6lfthryth, daughter of Ealdorman Ordgar, who was later the third wife of King Edgar, was first married to \u00c6thelwald. * \u00c6lfwald, called dux in charters.Byrhtferth of Ramsey (The Life of Saint Oswald, iii, 14) writes of \u00c6lfwald: \"He was exalted with such great authority, that he even disdained to become an ealdorman; , retrieved 2007-01-28. \u00c6lfwald was a prominent supporter of the monasteries and ordered the death of one Leofsige who was attempting to claim lands belonging to the monastery of Peterborough. He married Elfhild, perhaps the daughter of Ealdorman Elfsige. Andrew Wareham, Lords and Communities in Early Medieval East Anglia, Institute of Historical Research * \u00c6thelwig, Ealdorman. * \u00c6thelsige, became King Edgar's chamberlain (died c.986). * \u00c6thelwine (died 992), Ealdorman of East Anglia after \u00c6thelwald, youngest son of \u00c6thelstan. Chief Ealdorman from 983.Byrhtferth of Ramsey (The Life of Saint Oswald, iii, 14) presents \u00c6thelwine as a key supporter of the monasteries in land disputes, along with \u00c6lfwald; Miller; Williams. He married three times, firstly to Ethelflaed who died in 977, secondly to Ethelgifu (d. 985) and thirdly to Wulfgifu (d. 994).
