    "text": "Industria Argentina de Veh\u00edculos de Avanzada (IAVA) was a company created by the Fiat dealers of Argentina in 1971. As Abarth did in Italy, the goal of IAVA was to provide the Argentine industry with a higher performance version of the Argentinian Fiat 128. The philosophy was to use the platform of the 128, but change the engine to a transversely mounted 1100 cubic centimeter four cylinder. With this new engine IAVA offered, in addition to the increase in power, more comfort, and even aerodynamic accessories for the 128. IAVA also made version of the Fiat 147 which was named Fiat 147 Sorpasso. They also made versions of the Fiat 133 called the Fiat 133 IAVA and Fiat 133 Top respectively. Later, IAVA created a buggy called the Kikito Buggy but produced less than 25 units, along with 2 berlinetta-type prototypes. It also made a motor for boats based on an SSB structure and a prototype for the firm Mara. IAVA filed for bankruptcy in 1985 and ceased operations shortly after.
