    "text": "The Montreal Public Libraries Network (, previously R\u00e9seau des biblioth\u00e8ques publiques de Montr\u00e9al) is the public library system on the Island of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. It is the largest French language public library system in North America, and also has items in English and other languages. Its central branch closed in March 2005 and its collections incorporated into the collections of the Grande Biblioth\u00e8que. The municipally-run Montreal Public Libraries Network (as distinct from the provincial Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives nationales du Qu\u00e9bec, which is also located in Montreal) includes 67 libraries, including 44 libraries in the city of Montreal and 12 branches in other municipalities on the Island of Montreal. There are several additional branches which are privately funded public libraries within the system and which require a nominal membership fee. ==History== Montreal Mechanics Institute (established 1828) Montreal Mechanics Institute was one of a series of Mechanic's Institutes that were set up around the world after becoming popular in Britain. It housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. The Mechanic's Institutes libraries eventually became public libraries when the establishment of free libraries occurred. ==Services== *Information and reference services *Access to full text databases *Community information *Internet access *Reader's advisory services *Programs for children, youth and adults *Delivery to homebound individuals *Interlibrary loan *Free downloadable audiobooks ==Branches== *Ahuntsic *Belleville *Benny *Bibliobus *Biblio-courrier *Biblioth\u00e8que de la Maison culturelle et communautaire *Biblioth\u00e8que interculturelle *Cartierville *Charleroi *C\u00f4te-des-Neiges *Du Bois\u00e9 *Frontenac *Georges-Vanier *Haut-Anjou *Henri-Bourassa *Hochelaga *\u00cele des S\u0153urs *Jean-Corbeil *Langelier *La Petite- Patrie *Le Pr\u00e9vost *L'\u00cele-Bizard *L\u2019Octogone (LaSalle) *Maisonneuve *Marc- Favreau *Marie-Uguay *Mercier *Mordecai-Richler *Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce *Parc- Extension *P\u00e8re-Ambroise *Pierrefonds *Plateau-Mont-Royal *Pointe-aux-Trembles *Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies *Robert-Bourassa *Rosemont *Roxboro *Saint-Charles *Saint-Henri *Saint-L\u00e9onard *Saint-Michel *Saint-Pierre *Salaberry *Saul- Bellow *Jacqueline-De Repentigny *Vieux-Saint-Laurent ===Gallery=== File:Bibliotheque Saint-Michel.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que Saint-Michel; rue Fran\u00e7ois- Perrault File:Bibliotheque Cote-des-Neiges interieur.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que C\u00f4te- des-Neiges; C\u00f4te-des-Neiges File:Edifice Albert-Dumouchel.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que d'Ahuntsic, 10 300, rue Lajeunesse File:Bibliotheque Saint- Henri.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que Saint-Henri, rue Notre-Dame File:Bibliotheque L-ile- Bizard.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que L'\u00cele-Bizard, L'\u00cele-Bizard File:Bibliotheque Marc- Favreau 003.jpg|Biblioth\u00e8que Marc-Favreau, 700 boulevard Rosemont ==See also== * Atwater Library of the Mechanics' Institute of Montreall ==References== ==External links== *Montr\u00e9al Libraries Network *Montr\u00e9al Libraries Network *2006 data from Canadian Urban Libraries Council * Collection de la ville de Montr\u00e9al (R9582) at Library and Archives Canada.
