He became a member of the senior team when he was 17. He spent ten years with Al Ahly, scoring over 100 goals for the club through all ranks. He was dubbed one of the most talented footballers in the history of Egyptian football, but had to retire at the age of 27 due to a serious injury. ===International career=== Zizo played about 32 matches with his national side Egypt. He is one of very few Egyptian footballers to make his Egypt debut at the age of 17. He scored on his debut against German Democratic Republic in a friendly match in 1969. ==Managing career== ===Egypt=== After he retired in 1982, Zizo was immediately appointed football director for Al Ahly, winning the CAF Champions League in 1982. He worked as an assistant manager to Mahmoud El-Gohary for the Egypt first team in the early 1990s. He won the 1992 Arab Nations Cup in Syria with the team. Zizo also coached the Egypt Olympic team in 1999. He managed several Egyptian clubs including Al-Ittihad Al-Sakndary, Al-Masry, Baladeyet Al- Mahalla, Al-Mokawloon Al-Arab and Asmant Suez. Zizo led Baladeyet Al-Mahalla to the final of Egyptian Cup in 2002 for the first and only time in the club's history. He had three different spells as Al Ahly interim coach, as he guided the club to the 2015 Egyptian Super Cup which was staged in the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In the 2016-2017 season, Zizo, who was the club's head of football sector, played a vital role in Al Ahly's Egyptian Premier League victory, as he left the team 7 points clear on top of the table during his spell as interim manager. ===Saudi Arabia=== In Saudi Arabia, Zizo worked with Al-Ahli Jeddah between 1986 and 1987. He won the KSA Youth Championship title & Regional title with the club in 1987. A few years later, he joined rivals Al Ittihad as he won the KSA Youth Championship title in 1993. ===Lebanon=== In Lebanon, Zizo won the Lebanese Premier League with Nejmeh in 2004 and 2005. He also won the Lebanese Super Cup and Lebanese Elite Cup. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record !rowspan=2| |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Egypt U23 |align=left|1 July 1999 |align=left|1 March 2000 |- |align=left|Al Ittihad Alexandria Club |align=left|3 April 2000 |align=left|30 June 2000 |- |align=left|Nejmeh SC |align=left|1 July 2000 |align=left|30 June 2001 |- |align=left|Al Masry SC |align=left|27 November 2001 |align=left|1 July 2002 |- |align=left|Al Mokawloon Al Arab SC |align=left|1 July 2002 |align=left|1 October 2002 |- |align=left|Suez Cement SC |align=left|1 July 2007 |align=left|7 November 2007 |- |align=left|Nejmeh SC |align=left|12 March 2010 |align=left|22 May 2010 |- |align=left|Al Ahly SC (Caretaker) |align=left|23 November 2010 |align=left|31 December 2010 |- |align=left|Al Ahed FC |align=left|21 January 2014 |align=left|29 May 2014 |- |align=left|Al Ahly SC (Caretaker) |align=left|18 January 2016 |align=left|3 March 2016 |- |align=left|Pyramids FC (Caretaker) |align=left|18 December 2019 |align=left|\"\"Present\"\" |- !colspan=3|Total !\u2014 |} ==Honors== Footballer With Al Ahly: 7 Egyptian Premier League in 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 2 Egyptian Cup in 1978 and 1981 As Football Director with Al Ahly: CAF Champions League 1982 3 Egyptian Cup titles in 1982, 1983, 1984 As Manager With Al Ahly: * Egyptian Super Cup 2015 With Nejmeh: * Lebanese Premier League 2004, 2005, 2008 * Lebanese Super Cup 2004 * Lebanese Elite Cup 2004, 2005 ==References== * http://www.ahlyegypt.com/club/stars/zizo * https://web.archive.org/web/20070308203128/http://www.nejmeh.com/teams/technicalstaff-2003-2004.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20100919161314/http://arabia.eurosport.com/football/egyptian- league/2009-2010/%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%81%D8%A6-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%88_sto2248458/ar- story.shtml Category:Egyptian footballers Category:Egypt international footballers Category:Al Ahly SC players Category:Expatriate football managers in Lebanon Category:Lebanese Premier League managers Category:Nejmeh SC managers Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Egyptian Premier League players Category:Association football forwards Category:Egyptian football managers Category:Al Ahly SC managers ",
