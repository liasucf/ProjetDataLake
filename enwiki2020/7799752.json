It has a distinctive passive \"stay apparatus\" formed from bones and tendons to help it conserve energy while standing for long periods. Dinohippus was the first horse to show a rudimentary form of this character, providing additional evidence of the close relationship between Dinohippus and Equus.Florida Museum of Natural History Dinohippus was originally thought to be a monodactyl horse, but a 1981 fossil find in Nebraska shows that some were tridactyl.Horse Ecology The species D. leidyanus had an estimated body mass of approximately .M.
