Retrieved February 9, 2007 The total floor space of the building includes 1.8 million square feet (167,000 square meters) of office and retail space. ==Original building (1977\u20132001)== The original 4 World Trade Center was a 9-story low-rise office building completed in 1977 that was 118 ft (36 m) tall, and located in the southeast corner of the World Trade Center site.

Retrieved September 11, 2015 The building's major tenants were Deutsche Bank (Floor 4, 5, and 6) and the New York Board of Trade (Floors 7, 8, and 9). The building's side facing Liberty Street housed the entrance to The Mall at the World Trade Center on the basement concourse level of the WTC. It was practically destroyed as a result of the collapse of the South Tower during the September 11 attacks and its remains were later demolished to make way for the construction of the new skyscrapers: 4 World Trade Center and 3 World Trade Center. 4 World Trade Center was home to five commodities exchanges on what was at the time one of the world's largest trading floors (featured in the Eddie Murphy movie Trading Places). Following the destruction of the building during 9/11, rescuers and surveyors exploring the building's basement discovered large amounts of gold and silver bullion in the vault; a sizeable amount of coins that had been stored there by the Bank of Nova Scotia were purchased in 2002 as cleanup efforts began by Lee S. Minshull of California, who then submitted the coins to PCGS for grading; these coins bear unique labels on their holders, and have since entered the hands of collectors. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Tenants |- !
