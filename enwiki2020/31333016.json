It is designed to counter the numerous and increasingly sophisticated People's Liberation Army Navy ships by utilizing hit-and-run tactics, and thus featured clean upper structure design with very few extrusions to reduce radar signature, pre-cooled engine exhaust to reduce infrared signature, and a reduced visual signature to reduce chance of detection.http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/12/12/taiwanese-navy-showcases- new-killer-stealth- corvette.htmlhttp://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/ships/2014/12/23/taiwan- launches-its-largest-ever-missile- ship/20826049/http://phys.org/news/2011-07-taiwan-stealth-technology- breakthrough.htmlhttp://www.popsci.com/article/technology/taiwan-navy- launches-new-stealth-boathttp://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-navy-stealth- missile-warship-corvette-2014-12https://news.usni.org/2014/12/24/taiwan-navy- takes-delivery-first-stealth-carrier-killer- corvettehttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1668158/taiwan-navy-testing- stealth-frigates == Development == The program was announced by the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of National Defense (MND) on 12 April 2010. It was developed by the Naval Shipbuilding Center in Kaohsiung, The Tuo Chiang class was developed to address common weakness of traditional small warships such as patrol craft and corvettes namely poor sea-keeping, a significant handicap for warships expected to sortie for extended periods of time in rough seas around Taiwan. In 2011, the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan approved a NT$24.98 billion (US$853.4 million) budget to fund the construction of up to 12 ships. On 18 April 2011 a top military officer and a lawmaker announced that the construction of a 500-ton prototype would begin in 2012. In the Taipei Aerospace and Defense Technology Exhibition in 2013, the Navy unveiled a model of the Hsun Hai project corvette. The prototype of the Hsun Hai program was named and christened on Friday, 14 March 2014 as ROCS Tuo Chiang (PGG-618) in honor of the gunboat that was a combatant in the 9-2 Sea Battle during Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. In early 2016, the ROC Navy began plans for procuring three air defense frigates. It has been speculated that these frigates would possibly be catamarans based on the Tuo River-class hull. Expected weapon systems include the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) equipped with a naval variant of the Sky Bow III and the Sky Sword II, as well as the Sea Oryx CIWS system.ROC Navy to Build Three Air Defense Catamaran Corvettes based on Tuo River-class \u2013 Navyrecognition.com, 15 March 2016 It will field a ballistic missile defense version of the Sky Bow III missile defense system to shoot down incoming enemy ballistic missiles.Taiwan's NCSIST Successfully Tested a Ship-based Variant of Tien Kung III BMD Interceptor \u2013 Navyrecognition.com, 2 January 2017 In 2019 work commenced on the first of twelve 600-ton coastal patrol vessels for the Coast Guard Administration, the Anping-class offshore patrol vessel, based on the Tuo Chiang-class corvette at the Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company's Kaohsiung shipyard. == Design == The ship is a catamaran design which is long, wide and carries a crew of 41 personnel. It is capable of a maximum speed of 40 knots and a range of . It is armed with eight subsonic Hsiung Feng II and eight supersonic Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles launchers, a Phalanx Close-In Weapons System, and a main gun. The ship can operate up to sea state 7 in waves up to high. Taiwan Security Analysis Center (TAISAC) stated that the ship features stealth technologies to help evade radar detection, a combat system that includes a distributed- architecture combat direction system known as \u201cTaiwan Aegis\" developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and an indigenous search/track and fire-control radar and electro-optical director. The ship increases its survivability in naval warfare by utilizing advanced stealth technology and low radar cross section (RCS), which makes it less detectable by radar and allows it to be obscured by back ground radar noise when operating closer to the coastline.Taiwan Navy Emphasizing Domestic Shipbuilding Program in Ongoing Maritime Restructure \u2013 News.USNI.org, 25 March 2016 ==Ships of class== {| class = \"toccolours\" border = \"1\" cellspacing = \"1\" cellpadding = \"2\" style = \"margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse;\" |- style=\"background:#079;\" | Pennant Number | Name | Builder | Launched | Commissioned | Status | Note |- | PGG-618 | Tuo Chiang (\u6cb1\u6c5f\u8266) | Lung Teh Shipyard, Su-ao | 14 March 2014 | 23 December 2014 | Active | Class prototype |} ==See also== * Type 037 corvette * Type 022 missile boat ==References== ==External links== * NCSIST videos: , , and * Hsun Hai (Swift Sea) Tuo Jiang \u2013 missile corvette \u2013 Globalsecurity * Taiwan Navy Emphasizing Domestic Shipbuilding Program in Ongoing Maritime Restructure \u2013 USNI News Category:Corvettes of the Republic of China Navy Category:Military history of Taiwan Category:Ships built in the Republic of China Category:Military catamarans ",
