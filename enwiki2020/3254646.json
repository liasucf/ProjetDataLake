These wharfs have been redeveloped in the 21st century for housing and marina facilities. The station retains its signal box and semaphore signalling. ==Facilities== Refurbished footbridge (April 2020) The station buildings have been demolished and replaced by small shelters but arriving passengers must still cross the line by the original footbridge, which was refurbished in 2012. No ticketing facilities are provided, so passenger must buy tickets on the train or prior to travel. Train running information is offered via timetable posters and telephone. Step-free access to both platforms is available, though this requires the use of the station level crossing for Llandudno-bound passengers.Deganwy station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 13 January 2017 ==Services== There are hourly through services on weekdays to Manchester Piccadilly via Colwyn Bay, Abergele, Rhyl, Prestatyn, Flint, Shotton, Chester and Warrington There are four trains per day running along the Conwy Valley Line calling at stations such as Llanrwst, Betws-y-coed as well as Blaenau Ffestiniog Transport for Wales also provide a regular shuttle between Llandudno, Deganwy and Llandudno Junction.
