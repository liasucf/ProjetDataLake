    "text": "Louise Brachmann (2 February 1777 \u2014 17 September 1822) was a German poet, short story writer, and novelist. ==Biography== Louise Brachmann was born in Rochlitz, Saxony, to a civil service father and a cultured mother. Responsible for her education, Louise's mother was close to the Hardengerg family, which included the celebrated poet Novalis. Louise's mother introduced her to Novalis, who, recognizing Brachmann's talent and potential, recommended her to Friedrich von Schiller. Brachmann contributed to Schiller's journals the Die Horen and Musenalmanach. In 1800, four years after her first suicide attempt, her parents, sister, and three close friends died. She met Sophie Mereau in Jena, where she published poems and short stories in modern journals. However, she failed to find a publisher to sponsor her work in her lifetime. Brachmann's second suicide attempt was thwarted and, a few days later, she drowned herself in the river Saale in Halle, Germany. ==Published Works== Louise Brachmann's published works as cited by An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers. *Lyrische Gedichte, 1800. *Gedichte, 1808. *\"Einige Z\u00fcge aus meinem Leben in Beziehung auf Novalis\" *Romantische Bl\u00fcten, 1817. *Das fottesurteil.
