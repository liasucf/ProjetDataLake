By combining the number of over-11s from Kidlington with those from the church schools in the surrounding villages of Begbroke, Cassington, Hampton Poyle, Islip, Noke, Oddington, Shipton-on-Cherwell, Thrupp and Yarnton a sufficient number was achieved to justify the cost of a new school. The first Headteacher, when the school opened on 7 September 1932, was Herbert Chapman who had been the head of the National SchoolTossell, T. Gosford Hill School 1932 - 2007 pp 13-14.
