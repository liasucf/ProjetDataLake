    "text": "John Calvin Batchelor (born April 29, 1948) is an American author and host of The John Batchelor Show. Based at AM 770 WABC radio in New York for five years from early 2001 to September 2006, the show was syndicated nationally on the ABC radio network. On October 7, 2007, Batchelor returned to radio on WABC, and later to other large market stations on a weekly basis. As of November 30, 2009, Batchelor was once again hosting a nightly show on WABC, from 9 p.m. to 1a.m. Eastern Time and heard in many major markets across the country, now on the Westwood One network. The program for a time was heard seven nights a week, using prerecorded material on weekends. More recently, it has aired Monday through Friday on WABC and many Westwood One network affiliates. Batchelor describes the show as a \"news magazine\" since he does not take phone calls from listeners but does a series of interviews with guests and reporters. ==Early years== Batchelor was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania to an Assyrian mother from Iran and a Midwestern American father. He was raised primarily in Lower Merion Township of Montgomery County, in Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district. His mother and father both served in the United States Army during World War II; his father also served in the Korean War. Batchelor is the eldest of five brothers. He is a 1970 graduate of Princeton University and a graduate of Union Theological Seminary in New York. ==Broadcasting== ===Batchelor and Alexander=== Batchelor in 2010 John Batchelor co-hosted Batchelor and Alexander with writer Paul Alexander on WABC in New York for over two years. They focused on international issues with special attention to Middle East-based terrorism. Batchelor described their approach: \"Our model is the BBC World Service, with music and live interviews, but without English accents.\" Alexander quipped: \"We're not NPR, where they do setups to things on tape. Well, we could be NPR on drugs.\" Three days before the September 11 attacks, they presented a four-hour WABC show on the USS Cole bombing, interviewing several guests. Alexander left the show in December 2003 to pursue work as a playwright and biographer. ===The John Batchelor Show=== The John Batchelor Show began its national syndication in April 2003. The program airs 20 hours a week on roughly 200 stations. Its focus is geopolitics, economics, war, history, hard sciences, literature, private space, whimsy, etc. Historically, it carried nightly (Mon-Fri) the \"Loftus Report\" featuring the intelligence commentator John Loftus on current, war- related, open-source intelligence. Aaron Klein, at the time Jerusalem bureau chief for WorldNetDaily, was also a regular and served as a co-host. Other regular contributors included Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; the New York attorney and taste-maker Ed Hayes; Larry Kudlow of CNBC's Kudlow & Company: Bill Whelan of the Hoover Institution: John Fund, Bret Stephens, Dan Henninger, Rob Pollock and Kim Strassel of the Wall Street Journal; Jim McTague of Barron's Magazine; Chuck Todd, then of The Hotline, now NBC Political Director; Fiona Harvey and Martin Wolf of the Financial Times; Jodi Schneider of the Congressional Quarterly; Matt Bai and A. O. Scott of the New York Times; Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F. Cohen of The Nation; Victor Davis Hanson, Henry Miller, and Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution; Adrian Wooldridge, Robert Guest, and John Parker of the Economist; Monica Crowley; David Grinspoon, resident expert on the planet Mars and outer space, and Robert Zimmerman, award-winning NASA observer. The program daily featured reports from journalists who filed with the world's most respected press outlets, and the show was reliably a few days ahead of the news cycle. When John Batchelor occasionally took a break for several evenings, the show was often hosted by Jed Babbin, editor of Human Events in Washington, D.C.; sometimes by the former BBC journalist John Terrett, who now works for al Jazeera; and by Larry Kudlow of CNBC's Kudlow & Company and WABC's Larry Kudlow Show. In 2012, Simon Constable of Dow Jones; Chris Riback, author and researcher, and Francis Rose of Federal News Radio in Washington, D.C., became primary fill-ins. Batchelor's show featured multiple guests, and shows were preceded by and interspersed with news clips and music. The show focussed on myriad topics, including politics, the war on terror, nuclear proliferation, the UN, African civil wars, American history, space exploration and even Hollywood scandals. The Jerusalem Post has an audio archive of Batchelor and Alexander segments from 2002 and 2003 that deal with Israel and the Middle East. To report on breaking news, Batchelor and his executive producer have travelled domestically to hotspots, and to Azerbaijan, Qatar, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, France, Poland and Taiwan. They landed in Taipei to broadcast for the week leading up to the 2004 elections when, on the last day of electioneering, both the president and the vice-president were shot and wounded by an unknown assailant. ===Show cancellation and subsequent return=== On Monday, August 25, 2006, Batchelor announced on air that his ABC show would be canceled, beginning with the show scheduled for the next Monday, September 1. Batchelor returned on WABC as the host of a weekly version of the previous show on October 7, 2007, from 7\u201310pm Eastern Time. He then hosted a second show as a guest host on KFI in Los Angeles, filling the vacancy caused by the departure of Matt Drudge, in the next three hours from 7\u201310pm Pacific time. His first program featured an interview with Nick Grace of ClandestineRadio.com that broke the name of al Qaeda's extranet, Obelisk, and the news that the extranet's security tightened following a press leak in September 2007. In 2009, Batchelor expanded his show to Saturday and Sunday nights, from 9pm to 1am, on most of his affiliates. The Saturday show focused more on authors of history books, while the Sunday show focused on breaking news and a wider range of topics. On November 24, 2009, WABC announced that the Batchelor show would be also airing weeknights from 9pm to 1am, effective November 30. Batchelor was a frequent guest on the Gene Countryman Show, KNSS, Wichita, Kansas, Sundays at 8pm Eastern. Batchelor on Tuesdays formerly featured an hour with Larry Kudlow on finance (until Kudlow became an advisor to President Trump), and then an hour with professor Stephen Cohen on Russia. Professor Cohen elected to take a break for a while and the Tuesday guest as of early 2020 is Gregory R Copley, publisher of Defense and Foreign Affairs. On Wednesdays: an hour-plus with Gordon Chang on China and East Asia, and one or two segments on private exploration of space with Dr. David Livingston; on Thursdays: an hour with Mary Kissel on domestic U.S. politics, foreign policy, and matters Australian (until Kissel became a senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), then an hour and a half with Malcolm Hoenlein on the Middle East. == Bibliography == Writing as John Calvin Batchelor *The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet (1980) (novel) *The Birth of the People's Republic of Antarctica, Dial Press (1983) (novel) *American Falls (1985) (novel) *Thunder in the Dust: Classic Images of Western Movies (1987) (with John R.

Robert Zimmerman of behindtheblack frequently comes on to talk about NASA and the space program, preceded by the music from the Star Trek end credits. The show's last segment (c.12:55 AM EST) invariably features Al Bowlly's \"Midnight, the Stars and You\", ending in a brief (<30sec) valediction/good- night, sometimes with a few moments with a guest (time for one question). The singer is sometimes mistaken for Al Jolson, as Batchelor introduces the singer simply with \"here's Al,\" and the song dates from the time of Bowlly's late career. From 2001-2006, Batchelor ended his show with Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America.\" John Avlon, Jeff Bliss, Gordon Chang, Simon Constable, Taegan Goddard, Malcolm Hoenlein, Mary Kissel, Larry Kudlow, Francis Rose, and Chris Riback have frequently guest-hosted or co-hosted. == References == == External links == * The John Batchelor Show home page * New York Sun op-eds archive * Human Events op-eds archive * Category:Radio personalities from New York City Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:American people of Iranian-Assyrian descent Category:People from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Union Theological Seminary (New York City) alumni Category:Westwood One Category:American science fiction writers Category:American male novelists ",
