    "text": "Robert Lee Gavin (May 22, 1916 \u2013 June 11, 1981) was an American attorney and politician. == Early life and education == Robert Gavin was born on May 22, 1916 in Roseboro, North Carolina, United States to Edward Lee Gavin and Mary Caudle Gavin. Soon thereafter his family moved to Sanford, where he attended public schools. He then attended the University of North Carolina, but left after the outbreak of World War II to serve in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. After the war Gavin finished his education at the University of North Carolina School of Law and was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1946. He married Grace McNiell Blue and had three children with her. == Career == In 1954 Gavin was appointed Assistant United States District Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina. In 1957 he was made United States District Attorney for the Middle District, temporarily filling in a vacancy created by the departure of his predecessor. In 1958 he left the post to engage in private legal practice. In 1960 Gavin, a Republican, ran to become Governor of North Carolina in 1960. He faced Democrat Terry Sanford in the general election. Gavin denounced Sanford as a tool of the liberal leadership of the national Democratic Party and organized labor. He identified himself as a conservative but denied being a reactionary. He called for a \"fusion\" of Democratic and Republican voters to support his candidacy, and promised to institute a civil service system to reduce the amount of patronage available to state politicians. Though he said he would not make race an issue of his campaign, he criticized the national Democratic Party's support for civil rights. He lost the gubernatorial race, 613,975 votes to Sanford's 735,258 votes, but performed well in the traditionally Republican mountain region. In 1962 he became Chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. Gavin initially announced that he would not seek the Republican nomination for the 1964 North Carolina gubernatorial election, but changed his mind at the state Republican convention and accepted the nomination that year after being urged to do so by his colleagues. He lost the general election to Democrat Dan K. Moore, earning 606,165 votes to Moore's 790,343 votes. == References == == Works cited == * * * * Category:1916 births Category:1981 deaths Category:American lawyers Category:North Carolina Republicans Category:University of North Carolina School of Law alumni Category:United States Attorneys for the Middle District of North Carolina Category:20th- century lawyers Category:State political party chairs of North Carolina ",
