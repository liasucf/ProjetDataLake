It was originally known as Mutton Run until 1920 when its name was changed to Intermont. Because of Mutton Run's location on the Winchester and Western Railroad, it may have been renamed after the Intermountain Construction Company that completed the railroad from Winchester to Wardensville. Their post office is closed. == Historic sites == *Hebron Church (1849), WV Route 259 ==References== ==External links== Category:Unincorporated communities in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia ",
