Casey was born in Bury, Lancashire, England, and became interested in dialectical materialism as presented by Joseph Dietzgen in his book The Positive Outcome of Philosophy, of which the English translation was published in 1906. Although he originally trained as a plumber, after losing his leg in accident, he retrained as a watchmaker, and he supported himself by working as watchmaker for over fifty years. However he was also active as a tutor with the Manchester Labour College. ==Works== * Thinking; an introduction to its history and science (1922) London: The Labour Publishing Company Ltd. ==References== Category:British Marxists Category:1876 births Category:1956 deaths ",
