There were 2 ploughs, 5 serfs, 3 villeins, 6 smallholders, 12 acres of woodland, 100 acres of pasture, 3 cattle, 40 sheep and 20 goats. The value of the manor was 15 shillings though it had formerly been worth 25 shillings.Thorn, C., et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,24,21 Tregony used to be considered a town, and the rotten borough of Tregony elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons, until the Reform Act 1832 abolished its representation as a rotten borough.

Captain William Hennah RN, who took part in the Battle of Trafalgar retired to Tregony and died there. ==Churches and schools== The Church of St James at Tregony was founded in the 11th century but in the early 16th century it was abandoned as it had been submerged by the tidal river. (This was caused by the building of Tregony Bridge ca. 1300 which led to the accumulation of alluvial deposits on the riverbed.) The church valuables were removed to Cuby Church sometime between 1530 and 1553: for many years thereafter the building was quarried for stone and no remains were to be seen by the early 20th century. The church had been founded by the Norman family of Pomeroy whose castle stood here: nearby there were also in mediaeval times a priory and a chapel of St Anne. There are no remains of any of these buildings either.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 206-207 Since the parish lost its church, the parishioners have used Cuby Church instead. The other active church in Tregony is one of the few remaining independent Congregational churches\u2014those that did not become part of the United Reformed Church. The former Methodist Church still has a small wooden sign on it but is now a private home. It has a primary school in Back Lane. The area's secondary school, The Roseland Academy (built in 1962), is just over the Parish of Tregony boundary and has recently had a brand new sports hall. It has also achieved specialist school status in Music with English and IT. The almshouses were built in 1696 and rebuilt in 1895. ===Cornelly church=== Cornelly church The parish of Cornelly near Tregony has a church but no village: it is now grouped with Tregony and Cuby. Cornelly church is dedicated to St Cornelius and was built in the 13th century: the upper part of the tower, the south porch and the windows of the south wall are 15th century additions. The font is probably 16th century but of very crudely carved granite; the pulpit is painted with coats of arms; a monument to Jane Reeves, 1783, has an excellent portrait bust of her.Pevsner, N.
