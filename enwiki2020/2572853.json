    "text": "Sloppy Seconds is an American, Ramones-influenced punk band, from Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, that started in 1984. They gained notoriety in the underground punk scene with gritty and controversial songs like \"Come Back, Traci,\" \"I Don't Want to be a Homosexual\", \"Jani is a Nazi\", \"I Want 'em Dead\" and \"So Fucked Up.\" The band's unusual and controversial lyrics encompass pornography, classic horror movies, classic television shows, comic books, alcohol, being fat, and getting drunk. ==Band history== ===Establishment=== Sloppy Seconds was formed in 1984 by a group of friends from Indianapolis, Indiana.\"Sloppy Seconds,\" Flipside, whole no. 65 (Spring 1990), pp. 62-63. The band spent its first three years writing songs and honing its craft, releasing its first record, a four-song EP called The First Seven Inches, in 1987. Following the release of the first EP, the band went into the studio on its own, assisted by producer Paul Mahern, without a record label deal. Knowing from an early date that they were not a prolific recording band, the band sought to make an impact with its first full-length release, tabbing the record Destroyed as a play on Destroyer, a 1976 platinum album by stadium rockers KISS. In search of a home, the band sent out a demo tape including rough mixes of the first four songs completed for the project, with Toxic Shock Records ultimately picking up the project. This debut album was finally released in 1989, featuring parody artwork by Mike Kreffel, a fan of the band. A series of three singles followed for fans of the 7-inch vinyl format, featuring popular album tracks such as the anthemic \"I Don't Wanna Be a Homosexual\" and their controversial paean to underaged porn queen Traci Lords, \"Come Back Traci.\" Sloppy Seconds hosted a yearly festival called Sloppypalooza in Indianapolis, Indiana. ===Band name=== Their name derives from the slang term \"sloppy seconds\", describing the act in which a man has intercourse with another person who already has received another man's semen in the relevant orifice. ===Reunion=== In 2008, the group returned after a long hiatus, releasing Endless Bummer, their first full-length in ten years.Sloppy Seconds release first album in 10 years.
