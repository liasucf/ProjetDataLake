    "text": "Scatology is the debut studio album by English experimental music group Coil. It was recorded at various studios in London during 1984 and produced by the band along with JG Thirlwell; the album features a prominent appearance of Stephen Thrower, who subsequently became Coil's official member since their next studio album, Horse Rotorvator. Despite its title, the album focuses on alchemy, mainly an idea of turning base matter into gold. The record contains a wide array of cultural references, including personnel such as Marquis de Sade, Alfred Jarry, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Charles Manson, and others. Scatology was first released in 1985 (with a 1984 copyright date) on LP, by Force & Form and K.422 (Some Bizzare Records sublabel). It was reissued by Force & Form in 1988 on CD and later by Threshold House in 2001. Scatology\u2019s sole single featured the extended remix of \"Panic\" with a cover version of \"Tainted Love\" on its B-side. Mainly positively received by critics, Scatology is considered to be one of Coil's essential releases, and moreover of 1980's industrial scene. ==Background and recording== Work on Scatology began in May 1984, soon after the release of Coil's debut EP How to Destroy Angels. Early on, a track entitled \"The Sewage Worker's Birthday Party\" was recorded during sessions of the abovementioned EP, and was featured on 10\" free single applied to an issue of an Italian magazine Free, prior to being included on Scatology. Recording sessions were held at Wave Studios, Aosis Studios and Bar Maldoror (all situated in London). Several tracks during these sessions were recorded, but were not released or metamorphosed into other tracks. The core duo of the band, including Peter Christopherson and John Balance, was extended with an appearance of J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus and Stephen Thrower, the latter of whom met Coil for the first time in August 1984. ==Packaging== Different editions of the album featured a variety of packaging designs. For the original LP release, the initial black sun design covered by a postcard with a swirling staircase known as the \"Anal Staircase.\" The second edition had the \"Sexual Architecture\" postcard pasted on random covers with uncovered ones revealing the original black sun design. The 1988 CD edition featured artwork depicting a naked buttocks enclosed by an upside-down cross, finishing off with the original black sun below everything, seemingly inspired by Man Ray\u2019s Monument to Sade photography;; . the 2001 reissue features a revised artwork from the 1988 edition, with a slogan \u201cStevo, Pay Us What You Owe Us!\u201d referencing the band's dispute with Stevo Pearce.; . ==Track listing== ===Original LP release (1984)=== ===CD releases=== ==Personnel== All information adapted from 1984 release sleeve except where noted. ===Coil=== * John Balance \u2013 lead vocals and lyrics , guitars , synthesizer , bass * Peter Christopherson \u2013 programming and sampling, piano, backing vocals ===Additional musicians=== * JG Thirlwell \u2013 programming and sampling * Stephen Thrower \u2013 clarinet , percussion * Gavin Friday \u2013 lead vocals and lyrics * Alex Fergusson \u2013 acoustic guitar * Marc Almond \u2013 guitar ===Technical personnel=== * Coil \u2013 co-production, mixing * JG Thirlwell \u2013 co-production, mixing * Warne Livesey \u2013 engineer * Christian Fouquet and Lawrence Watson \u2013 photography * Thighpaulsandra \u2013 remastering ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== ===Bibliography=== ;Scatology's liner notes * * * ;Books * * * * * * * ;Articles (including reviews) * * * * ==External links== * * * Scatology at Brainwashed Category:1984 debut albums Category:Coil (band) albums Category:Threshold House albums Category:Albums produced by JG Thirlwell ",
