    "text": "Claudia Rusca (1593 \u2013 6 October 1676) was an Italian composer, singer, and organist. She was a nun at the Umiliate monastery of St. Caterina in Brera. She learned music at home, before she professed her final vows at the convent. She probably wrote her Sacri concerti \u00e0 1\u20135 con salmi e canzoni francesi (Milan, 1630) for use in the monastery and similar female institutions. The only known copy was thought to be destroyed in a fire at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in 1943.Kendrick However, International Music Score Library Project has a facsimile available as well as modern editions of \u201cSacri concerti\u201d. ==References== *Robert L.
