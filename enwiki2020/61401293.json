His magnum opus was his biographical-genealogical history on etymology and orthography of Islamic names, Al-Ikm\u0101l. ==Life== Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r ibn M\u0101k\u016bl\u0101 was a native of the village Ukbara on the Tigris north of Baghd\u0101d and the son of Hibat-Al\u0101h\u0101 ibn Makula, vizier to the Buyid ruler of Ba\u1e63rah, Jal\u0101l-al-dawla. He gained the title \u2018al- Am\u012br\u2019 (), or \u2018prince\u2019, maybe in his own right, or in reference to his famous ancestor Ab\u016b Dulaf al-Ijl\u012b. His family had originally come from Jarb\u0101zak\u0101n, between Hamad\u0101n and Isfahan in Ir\u0101n, but his paternal uncle, was a mu\u1e25addith (traditionist), and q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b (chief justice) in Baghd\u0101d where Ibn M\u0101k\u016bl\u0101 began his studies. He continued his education by travelling to the regional centres of learning across Ir\u0101q, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, Syria, Egypt, and Fars. In the last years of his life he held various official posts in the imperial administration of the Seljuk Empire, and once led an embassy to Bukhara to obtain the recognition of the new Abb\u0101sid caliph Al-Muqtadi (1075-1094). One anecdote tells of a personal application made by Ibn M\u0101k\u016bl\u0101 on behalf of the grammarian Al-Akhfash the Younger, requesting a pension from the vizier Ab\u016b al-\u1e24asan Al\u012b ibn \u2018\u012as\u0101. This was angrily rejected it seems and the scholar was left in abject poverty. In the account of his eventual assassination the sources differ on details of location and date. It seems that sometime, either in 475 h. [1082/1083] or 487 h. [1094/95], or 479 h. [1086/87], he was on a trip for Khur\u0101s\u0101n when he was murdered and robbed by his Mamluk guards, either in Jurjan in Golestan Province, or al-Ahvaz in Khuzestan; or in Kirm\u0101n, Iran. ==Works== *Al-Ikm\u0101l () (\u2018Completion\u2019); full title al-Ikm\u0101l f\u012b raf\u2019 al-irtiy\u0101b \u2018an al-mu\u2019talif wa al- mukhtalif min al-asm\u0101\u2019 wa al-kun\u0101 wa al-ans\u0101b (); 4 vols., (written 10711075) standard treatise on orthography and pronunciation of proper names.Note: Originally published as a supplement to Al-Kh\u0101tib Ab\u016b Bakr's Al-Mutanif Takmila al-Mukhtalif (\u2018The recommenced, being the completion of the Mukhtalif\u2019), or Al-Takmila, itself the combined works of: i) Al-M\u016btalif wa Mukhtalif () by Al-Daraqutni and ii) Al-Mushtabih Al-Nisba from the Al-Kam\u0101l f\u012b ma\u2019rifat asm\u0101\u2019 al-Rij\u0101l () by \u1e25\u0101fi\u1e93 Abd al-Gh\u0101n\u012b. \u2014 In 1232, muhaddith Ibn Nukta (), published Takmila al-Ikm\u0101l (), as an addendum to Al-Ikm\u0101l. *Kit\u0101b Tahdhib mustamar al-Awham \u2018al\u0101 dhu\u012b al-ma\u2019rifat wa awwal\u012b al-Afh\u0101m () *Muf\u0101kharat al-qalam wa\u2019l-sayf wa\u2019l-d\u012bn\u0101r (); *Ta\u02ber\u012bkh al-Wuzar\u0101 ('History of the Viziers'). ==See also== *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online *List of Arab scientists and scholars ==Notes== ==References== == References == * * * * * * * * Vadet, J.-C . \"Ibn M\u0101k\u016bl\u0101.\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, second edition.
