    "text": "Take a Vacation! is the only studio album by American rock band The Young Veins, and the first musical project by Ryan Ross and Jon Walker after their departure from Panic! at the Disco. Critics have compared the album's sound to the music of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, The Hollies, The Searchers, and The Zombies, and have noted its similarities to the earlier Panic! album Pretty. Odd. ==Background and production== While on tour with Panic! at the Disco in 2008, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker began writing songs intended for the band's third album, but after showing the other members the songs they were working on it became apparent that a split was occurring over the direction that the band wanted to go in.
