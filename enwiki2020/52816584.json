He is a professor of history at the University of Florida, where he is the Norman and Irma Braman Professor of Holocaust Studies.Profile, the University of Florida web site Goda is the author of several books on the international policy of Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the Cold War. He also serves as a historical consultant for the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group of the United States National Security Archive, tasked with reviewing the previously-classified intelligence documents of the World War II and its aftermath.Interagency Working Group (IWG) ==Historian== Goda is the co-author of the book U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis, which was published in 2005 by the Cambridge University Press and based on the materials that were declassified under the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. Reviewing the book in the journal History, the historian Steven Casey called the book \"remarkable\" and noteed that book \"sheds new light on three controversial aspects of the war and post-war period:\" how much US intelligence organisations knew about the Holocaust, the crimes of individual Nazi perpetrators, and the \"extent to which US intelligence knowingly collaborated with war criminals during the cold war.\" Casey noted: > Breitman et al. have used these [declassified documents] to write a series > of measured case studies, which, unsurprisingly, confirm that many post-war > exculpatory accounts by leading Nazis were highly misleading. Indeed, > whereas figures such as SD Intelligence Chief Walter Schellenberg sought to > depict themselves as reluctant Nazis who had tried their best to save the > lives of concentration camp victims or to bring the war to a swift > conclusion, the new documents confirm that they were actually ruthless > individuals who not only had plenty of blood on their hands but also > remained wedded if not to the Nazi cause then at least to their Nazi > comrades long after May 1945. ==Bibliography== * Tomorrow the World: Hitler, Northwest Africa, and the Path Toward America, Texas A&M; University Press, 1998, . *U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis, Cambridge University Press. 2005.
