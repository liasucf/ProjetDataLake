    "text": "The Black Sea Fleet (, Chernomorsky Flot) is the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean Sea. The fleet traces its history to its founding by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783. The Russian SFSR inherited the fleet in 1918; with the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922 it became part of the Soviet Navy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Russian Federation inherited the Black Sea Fleet and most of its vessels. The Black Sea Fleet has its official primary headquarters and facilities in the city of Sevastopol (Sevastopol Naval Base). The remainder of the fleet's facilities are based in various locations on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast and Crimea. The commander, Vice-Admiral Igor Vladimirovich Osipov, has held his position since May 2019. ==History== Russian Black Sea Fleet after the battle of Sinope, 1853 The Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol. Formerly commanded by such legendary admirals as Dmitriy Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of enormous historical and political importance for Russia. In 1790, Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait.Black Sea Fleet (BSF) Morskoyo Flota (Naval Force) . Globalsecurity.org. From 1841 onward, the fleet was confined to the Black Sea by the London Straits Convention. As a result of the Crimean War, one provision of the Treaty of Paris was that the Black Sea was to be a demilitarized zone like the Island of \u00c5land in the Baltic Sea, although Russia subsequently renounced the treaty and reconstituted its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea. The crew of the battleship revolted in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo- Japanese War. Lenin wrote that the Potemkin uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army. During World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea. The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to having under their command the German battlecruiser , but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts and had been built in Mykolaiv, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917. German submarines of the Constantinople Flotilla and Turkish light forces would continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war's end. ===Soviet Navy=== During the Russian Civil War, the vast majority of the Black Sea Fleet was scuttled by Bolsheviks in Novorossiysk; some were managed to be interned by the Central Powers (later passed to Ukraine, see Navy of the Ukrainian People's Republic) or Western Allies (later passed to the White movement, see Wrangel's fleet). In 1919 out of the remnants of the Russian Imperial Fleet was established the Red Fleet of Ukraine which existed few months before a major advance of the Armed Forces of South Russia which occupied all the South and East Ukraine. Most of the ships became part of the \"Russian Squadron\" of Wrangl's armed forces and after the evacuation sailed to Tunisia. Out of those ships, some were passed to the French Navy and some were salvaged. Upon the defeat of the Armed Forces of South Russia, the Ukrainian National Army and the Polish Armed Forces in Ukraine the Soviet government signed a military union with the Russian SFSR transferring all the command to the Commander-in-chief of Russia. Few ships that did stay in Black Sea were salvaged in the 1920s, while a large scale new construction programme began in the 1930s. Over 500 new ships were built during that period as well as massive expansion of coastal infrastructure took place. The Fleet was commanded by Vice Admiral F.S. Oktyabrskiy on the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941. The Fleet gave a credible account of itself as it fought alongside the Red Army during the Siege of Odessa and the Battle of Sevastopol.John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, Cassel Military Paperbacks, 2003, p.205 (See Black Sea Campaigns (1941\u201344) for more details.) In 1952, Turkey decided to join NATO, placing the Bosporus Strait in the Western sphere of influence. Together with the advent of long-range nuclear weapons, this dramatically decreased the strategic value of any naval activity in the Black Sea. In the later post-war period, along with the Northern Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet provided ships for the 5th Operational Squadron in the Mediterranean, which confronted the United States Navy during the Arab-Israeli wars, notably during the Yom Kippur War in 1973.On Airpower.org, Military Thought article on Soviet Mediterranean squadron air defence .

Also that year, the 119th Fighter Aviation Division, with the 86th Guards, 161st, and 841st Guards Fighter Aviation Regiments, joined the Fleet from the 5th Air Army. The 86th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment became part of the Moldovan Air Force upon the breakup of the Soviet Union. The 841st at Meria airport (between Poti and Batumi in the Adjar ASSR) (Georgian SSR) became the 841st independent Guards Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment in May 1991 and was disbanded in October 1992.The 841st Guards IAP was the former 66th Guards IAP.

The military importance of the fleet has degraded since the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to significant funding cuts and, to a degree, the loss of its major missions. However, in the early 21st century, local conflicts in the Caucasus region (particularly the 2008 South Ossetia war) saw Moscow employ elements of the Black Sea Fleet off the coast of Georgia, and the development of oil transit in the region has strengthened Russia's support of the fleet. In 1992, the major part of the personnel, armaments and coastal facilities of the Fleet fell under formal jurisdiction of the newly independent Ukraine as they were situated on Ukrainian territory. Later, the Ukrainian government ordered the establishment of its own Ukrainian Navy based on the Black Sea Fleet; several ships and ground formations declared themselves Ukrainian. However, this immediately led to conflicts with the majority of officers who appeared to be loyal to Russia. According to pro- Ukrainian sailors they were declared \"drunkards and villains\" and they and their families were harassed. The have also claimed that their names were branded \"traitors to Russia\" on local graffiti. Simultaneously, pro-Russian separatist groups became active in the local politics of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the Sevastopol municipality where the major naval bases were situated, and started coordinating their efforts with pro-Moscow seamen. ====Joint Fleet and its partition==== To ease the tensions, the two governments signed an interim treaty, establishing a joint Russo-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet under bilateral command (and Soviet Navy flag) until a full- scale partition agreement could be reached. Formally, the Fleet's Commander was to be appointed by a joint order of the two countries' Presidents. However, Russia still dominated the Fleet unofficially, and a Russian admiral was appointed as Commander; the majority of the fleet personnel adopted Russian citizenship. Minor tensions between the Fleet and the new Ukrainian Navy (such as electricity cut-offs and sailors' street-fighting) continued. Some major ships (including the flagship) of the Soviet and Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, August 2007 On 28 May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed several agreements regarding the fleet including the Partition Treaty, establishing two independent national fleets and dividing armaments and bases between them. Ukraine also agreed to lease major parts of its facilities to the Russian Black Sea Fleet until 2017. However, the treaty appeared to be far from perfect: permanent tensions on the lease details (including often reported issue of lighthouse control) continued. The Fleet's main base is still situated in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol. In 2009 the Yushchenko Ukrainian government declared that the lease would not be extended and that the fleet would have to leave Sevastopol by 2017.No Russian fleet in Ukraine beyond 2017 -Ukrainian PM : Ukraine News by UNIAN . Unian.net (September 24, 2008). In 2010 the Russian leasehold was renegotiated with an extension until 2042 and an option for an additional five years until 2047 plus consideration of further renewals. ====Georgia in the Fleet partition==== The newly independent nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet when it was the Georgian SSR, also claimed a share of the Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti. Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992. Additionally, some low- importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control. In 1996, Georgia resumed its demands, and the Russian refusal to allot Georgia a portion of the ex-Soviet navy became another bone of contention in the progressively deteriorating Georgian-Russian relations. This time, Ukraine endorsed Tbilisi's claims, turning over several patrol boats to the Georgian Navy and starting to train Georgian crews, but was unable to include in the final fleet deal a transfer of the formerly Poti- based vessels to Georgia.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's (opt, mozilla, unix,english,,new) Newsline . Vol. 1, No. 42, Part I, May 30, 1997 Later, the rest of the Georgian share was decided to be ceded to Russia in return for diminution of debt. Since the 2008 South Ossetia war the Russian Black Sea Fleet has not taken part in any joint naval exercises involving Georgian warships.Russia's Black Sea Fleet rules out joint drills with Georgia, UNIAN (June 17, 2009) However, such a statement has little meaning since the Georgian Navy has ceased to exist (early 2009 it was merged with the Georgian coast guard).Navy to Merge with Coast Guard , FINANCIAL (December 3, 2008) Russia is a member of the Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group usually referred to as BLACKSEAFOR. ====Combat operations==== Russia employed part of the fleet during the 2008 Georgian conflict. Russian units operating off Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region resulted in a reported skirmish and sinking of a ship of the Georgian Navy. As a result, Ukraine's then President Viktor Yushchenko decreed that the Black Sea Fleet would henceforth need permission to cross the Ukrainian border to enter and leave to Sevastopol, to which a Russian admiral retorted that the President of the Russian Federation and not Ukraine commands the Black Sea Fleet. Yushchenko's decrees were without force and deployed units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet returned to their home moorings without incident. The texts of the 1997 Ukraine-Russia agreements regarding the presence of Russian Black Sea Fleet ships in Crimea contained no requirement for Ukraine's permission to cross the Ukrainian border to enter or exit Sevastopol. *Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War ====Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine==== In a letter to then Russian President Medvedev, former Ukrainian President Yushchenko complained about alleged \"infringements of bilateral agreements and Ukrainian legislation\"The Crimea: Europe's Next Flashpoint? , By Taras Kuzio, November 2010 Vladimir Putin with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on board the Black Sea Fleet's flagship, July 2001 In 2009, Ukraine government announced that the lease of Russian naval bases on the Crimea would not be extended beyond 2017,Russia denies naval bases report , BBC News (January 16, 2009)Yulia Tymoshenko: Russian Black Sea Fleet would not remain in Crimea, Personal web site of Yulia Tymoshenko (June 25, 2009) in response the Russian Black Fleet initiated the expansion of its base in Novorossiysk.

Those agreements stipulate that the Russian Black Sea Fleet can maintain the same numbers and types of ships that it had based in Sevastopol as a result of the 1997 fleet division without approval by Ukraine. This stipulation permits Russia to increase the current size of the fleet which has fallen below those numbers.Russia-Ukraine Agreement on the Division of the Black Sea Fleet, May 1977 As a result of the stance of the Ukrainian authorities, it was reported on 20 May 2013 that Russia would be concentrating on its new base in Novorossiysk and putting Sevastopol on hold as it upgrades the Black Sea Fleet. The Project-11356 frigate Admiral Grigorovich and the Project-636 submarines (Kilo class submarine) Novorossiysk and Rostov-na-Donu were expected to join the Fleet in 2014 and new moorings were being made ready for them at the base. Repeated and sometimes contradictory announcements were made concerning new ships that would join the fleet. On December 3, 2009, First Vice Mayor of Sevastopol Vladimir Kazarin stated that Russia's Black Sea Fleet could lose its combat capability, given a small number of ships and the absence of new ones.Sevastopol official: Black Sea Fleet risks to lose combat capability by 2017 , Kyiv Post (December 3, 2009) Similar doubts had been stated by the Russian media.

Also in 2010, Russian Navy Headquarters sources said that, by 2020, six frigates of Project 22350 Gorshkov-class, six submarines of Project 677 Lada-class, two large landing ships of Project 11711 Ivan Gren-class and four class-unspecified ships would be delivered. Due to the obsolescence of the Beriev Be-12 by 2015, they would be replaced with Il-38s.

Rusnavy.com (October 27, 2010). ===Strengthening of the Fleet=== The Russian seizure of Crimea changed the situation and role of the Black Sea Fleet significantly. Analysis undertaken by Micheal Peterson of the US Navy War College suggests that since the Russian seizure of Crimea, the modernization of Russian shore- based assets and of the Black Sea Fleet itself has assisted in re-establishing Russian military dominance in the region. Specifically Peterson argues: \"Russian maritime dominance in the Black Sea is back. The shift was made possible by Moscow\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea and subsequent buildup of combat and maritime law enforcement capabilities in the region\".https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/the-naval-power-shift-in-the-black- sea/ After the 2014 Crimean crisis, in which Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Navy were evicted from their bases and subsequently withdrawn from Crimea, Russia planned to integrate several vessels from the Ukrainian Navy into the Black Sea Fleet. According to sources from Black Sea Fleet Headquarters, inspections of all ships were to be done by the end of 2014. Speaking ahead of the nationwide Navy Day festivities in 2015, Black Sea Fleet commander Adm. Vitko said that, \"For the first time in quite a long period, more than ten brand-new boats and support vessels have been accepted into service within one calendar year.\" Overall, in 2015 the fleet received 15 new ships, including two submarines, two missile corvettes, seven counter-sabotage boats, support, rescue and auxiliary vessels. The composition of the Black Sea Fleet shifted to focus on the Improved Kilo-class submarines instead of the Lada, the Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates and at least three new classes of missile corvettes (the Steregushchiy, Karakurt and Buyan-M classes). The deployment of the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate with the Black Sea Fleet was still anticipated, though in reduced numbers.https://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence- news/2020/june/8599-three-latest-frigates-admiral-gorshkov-class-of- project-22350-will-join-the-russian-navy-pacific-fleet.html The projection of power into the Mediterranean has also returned as a significant role for the Black Sea Fleet. Both the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla have supported Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War with units from the former now routinely deployed into the Mediterranean.https://news.usni.org/2020/07/08/russian-black-sea-sub- deployments-to-mediterranean-could-violate-treaty The Black Sea Fleet's amphibious capabilities are planned to be expanded in the 2020s through the acquisition of one of the new Priboy-class helicopter assault ships.https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/08/russias-project-23900-lhd- to-be-able-to-operate-in-the-arctic/ Also significant is the build-up of Russian surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missile assets in the region. Dmitry Gorenburg of the Centre for Naval Analysis (CNA) has noted that: \"Russia\u2019s expanded military footprint in Crimea allows it to carry out a range of operations that it was not capable of prior to 2014. The deployment of S-400, Bastion, and Bal missiles allows the Russian military to establish an anti-access/area-denial zone (A2/AD) covering almost all of the Black Sea. By using a combination of ground-based and ship-based missiles, backed with strong electronic warfare capabilities, the Russian military can inhibit military movement into the Black Sea and deny freedom of action to an opponent if it does make it into the theater. The long-range sea-, air-, and ground- launched missiles deny access, while shorter-range coastal and air defense systems focus on the area denial mission. The result is several interlocking air defense zones\".https://warontherocks.com/2018/07/is-a-new-russian-black- sea-fleet-coming-or-is-it-here/Ongoing technological upgrades of this already robust SAM network are planned for the 2020s.https://eurasiantimes.com/russia- to-modify-its-s-400-missiles-making-it-much-more-lethal-economical-to- operate/Others, such as Michael Kofman of CNA, argue that while there is no A2/AD doctrine or term in Russian military strategy, Russian forces nevertheless are organized at at an operational and strategic level to deploy a wide range of overlapping defensive and offensive capabilities that extend beyond just one theatre of operations like the Black Sea.https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/its-time-to-talk-about-a2-ad-rethinking- the-russian-military-challenge/ The evident American response to the dense shore-based anti-ship and air defence capabilities that Russia has developed in the Black Sea region, and elsewhere, has been to place greater emphasis on striking at potential Black Sea and other targets utilizing stand-off air- launched cruise missiles deployed on American long-range bombers.https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33787/air-force-reveals-b-1bs- were-practicing-decapitating-russias-black-sea-fleet-last-week ==Controversies== The Russian Black Sea Fleet's (BSF) use of leased facilities in Sevastopol and the Crimea was sometimes controversial. A number of incidents took place: * For security reasons, the BSF refused to allow Ukrainians to inspect its aircraft cargo, after allegations by Ukrainians that they could be carrying nuclear weapons, which would have infringed upon Ukraine's status under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) * The BSF transported rockets repeatedly through the port of Sevastopol without seeking permission from Ukrainian authorities. * A lighthouse is located on the headland which, starting in 2005, was the subject of a controversy between Ukraine and Russia. From August 3, 2005, the lighthouse was occupied by the Russian military. Despite a controversial ruling by a Court in Sevastopol on the subject, Russian military officials referred to the fact that they only took orders from the chief of the Russian Navy headquarters and no one else. Ukrainian activists complained that Sarych was illegally occupied by the Russian Navy. As a military facility, the territory around the Sarych headland is closed to trespassers with barbed wire, and the Russian flag flew over Sarych. * In 2006, Ukrainian officials blocked Russian workers from entering the BSF lighthouse in Yalta. * During the 2008 South Ossetia War, the Ukrainian Navy was ordered to block the entrance to Sevastopol from Russian vessels taking part in the hostilities. However, Russian Navy ships returned to base unimpeded by the sympathetic Ukrainian sailors. * June 20, 2009 \u2013 In Sevastopol, a Russian fleet servicemen allegedly used physical force against 30 civilians. The city also alleges contract violations by the Construction Management Corporation of the Black Sea Fleet for not following through on promises to construct requested commercial housing after taking advance payment. The city began talks with the President and the Prime-Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, and also to the Russian Minister of Defense Anatoliy Serdyukov with respect to the contract violations, but those did not yield results. * On August 27, 2009, Russian marines successfully prevented Ukrainian bailiffs from enforcing a Ukrainian court ruling on seizing lighthouses belonging to the BSF. Russia stated that Ukrainians may not step onto its bases without permission. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry described the Russian obstruction as a \"disregard for Ukrainian legislation and international agreements\". * On April 16, 2013, a \"high-ranking Russian Defense Ministry official\" complained to Interfax that \"Ukraine\u2019s stubborn position\" was slowing the cancellation of customs payments (for the fleet) and that Ukraine still upheld (former) Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko's 2008 decrees that banned the \"relaxed procedure\" of BSF formations crossing the Ukrainian border.Kyiv obstructs Black Sea Fleet\u2019s modernization, says Russian

from the Ukrainian Navy=== In the 2014 Crimean crisis Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Navy were evicted from their bases and Ukraine subsequently withdrew its forces from Crimea. Fifty- four out of sixty-seven ships of the Ukrainian Navy have been transferred to the Black Sea Fleet, with St. Andrew flags raised on them. On 8 April 2014 an agreement was reached between Russia and Ukraine to return Ukrainian Navy materials to Ukraine proper.Russia begins returning Ukraine naval vessels and aircraft , Jane's Defence Weekly (12 April 2014) The greater portion of the Ukrainian naval ships and vessels were then returned to Ukraine but Russia suspended this process after Ukraine did not renew its unilaterally declared ceasefire on 1 July 2014 in the conflict in the Donbass. According to the fleet commander Aleksandr Vitko, this happened because the vessels were old \"and, if used [by Ukraine], could hurt its own people\". Holiday without brother: Sevastopol celebrated Navy Day , BBC Ukrainian (28 July 2014) The Black Sea Fleet, and other Russian ground and air forces in Crimea, are subordinate to the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces. The Black Sea Fleet is one component of Russian forces in the Southern Military District and is supported by other Russian military formations in the District, including the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army.https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/bp_1812_black_sea_russia_0.pdf The Russian Coast Guard provides additional armed patrol capabilities, which have also been expanded since the Russian seizure of Crimea to support the enforcement of Russian territorial claims.https://warsawinstitute.org/mare- nostrum-strategy-russian-military-activity-black- sea/https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/meet-russias-new-weapon-against- ukraine-coast-guard-37512 ===30th Surface Ship Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !# !Type !Name !Class !Year !Status |- |121 |Guided Missile Cruiser |Moskva |Slava |1983 |Active, Fleet Flagship |- |801 |Guided Missile Frigate |Ladnyy |Krivak |1980 |Active |- |808 |Guided Missile Frigate |Pytlivyy |Krivak |1981 |Active |- |745 |Guided Missile Frigate | |Admiral Grigorovich |2016 |Active |- |751 |Guided Missile Frigate | |Admiral Grigorovich |2016 |Active |- |799 |Guided Missile Frigate | |Admiral Grigorovich |2017 |Active |} ===4th Independent Submarine Brigade=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !# !Type !Name !Class !Year !Base !Status |- |554 |Diesel Attack Submarine |Alrosa (B-871)Noted as in service with pump-jet propulsion by one source but not confirmed.
