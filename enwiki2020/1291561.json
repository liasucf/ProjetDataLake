    "text": "Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian (born Boles\u0142aw Lesman; January 22, 1877The exact date of his birth is disputed: the act of birth mentions 1877, Le\u015bmian himself used 1878, while the date mentioned on his tombstone is 1879. - November 5, 1937) was a Polish poet, artist and member of the Polish Academy of Literature, one of the first poets to introduce Symbolism and Expressionism to Polish verse. Though largely a marginal figure during his lifetime, Le\u015bmian is now considered one of Poland's greatest poets. He is, however, little known outside of his home country, mostly on account of his neologisms-rich idiosyncratic style, dubbed \"almost untranslatable\" by Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and \"the ultimate and overwhelming proof for the untranslatability of poetry\" by noted Polish Shakespearean translator, Stanis\u0142aw Bara\u0144czak. ==Biography== Photograph of Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian was born January 22, 1877 in Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire to a family of Polonized Jewish intelligentsia. He spent his childhood and youth in Kiev, where he graduated from the law faculty of Saint Vladimir University. In 1901, he returned to Warsaw. From there, he set off on a journey to various European cities, including Munich and Paris, where he married a painter, Zofia Chyli\u0144ska. Heavily influenced by French modernists, Le\u015bmian returned to Warsaw, where he became one of the founders of an experimental Artistic Theatre. There he also met one of his closest friends, Zenon Przesmycki, with whom he became involved in the publication of Chimera, an art newspaper. Although he made his debut in 1895 (a series of poems published in W\u0119drowiec magazine), his works initially went unnoticed. To sound \"more Polish\", Le\u015bmian adopted a slightly modified version of his surname which included typically Polish sounds (previously it had been Lesman). According to various conflicting sources, the author of the pen-name which eventually became his official surname was either the known poet and poet's uncle Antoni Lange, or a renowned bon-vivant of Warsaw, Franc Fiszer. The first booklet issued in Warsaw in 1912 (Sad Rozstajny) did not bring him much publicity either, and in 1912 Le\u015bmian moved back to France. He returned in 1914. From 1918 until 1934, he worked as a notary of large landed estates in Hrubiesz\u00f3w and then as a lawyer in Zamo\u015b\u0107. At the same time he published the best known of his books: \u0141\u0105ka (The Meadow, 1920) and Nap\u00f3j cienisty (Shadowy Drink, 1936). In 1933, he was accepted as a permanent member of the Polish Academy of Literature. In 1935, he moved back to Warsaw, where he died two years later. He is buried in Pow\u0105zki Cemetery, in the Alley of the Meritorious, among other notable Polish writers, politicians and military men. Le\u015bmian and Chyli\u0144ska had two daughters, one of who, Wanda \"Dunia\" Le\u015bmian\u00f3wna, would later marry British adventurer and traveller Denis Hills. Actress and singer Gillian Hills - famous for her brief appearances in Antonioni's Blowup and Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange in two similar scenes - was born of this marriage in 1944. Le\u015bmian was also nephew of the famous poet and writer of the Young Poland movement, Antoni Lange, and the cousin of another notable poet of the epoch, Jan Brzechwa. ==Work== To Polish readers, Le\u015bmian's style is unique and easily recognizable, intuitively accessible despite its idiosyncrasy. In his poems, in a fantastical, mythical and fabulous environment - often inhabited with creatures taken from the Polish folklore and traditions - Le\u015bmian expounds his life philosophy, revolving around his equally deep and personal fascinations with God and death. The protagonists of his works are usually \"handicapped humans\", struggling between Culture and Nature, unable to accept their in-between positions. For Le\u015bmian, the only ones who can do this - the only ones able to live with both Culture and Nature simultaneously - are poets, the last examples of \"the primitive mankind.\" Relying heavily on \"the vertiginous word-formation potential of Polish,\" Le\u015bmian's style is especially notable for its numerous neologisms, many of which are still in use in everyday Polish language (as opposed to, say, Cyprian Norwid's similar experiments). Referred to as \"le\u015bmianisms\" by subsequent scholars, these neologisms are usually the product of the versatile \"prefix+verb/noun(+suffix)\" formula natural to most Slavic languages, but peculiar to many other languages, rendering Le\u015bmian's poetry \"almost untranslatable\" into English. Some of Le\u015bmian's favourite prefixes include those who imply a lack of certain qualities (like bez- or nie-, loosely, \"without,\" or \"non-\"), leading certain scholars to dub him \"the Dante of non- being.\" Considered one of the greatest Polish poets in history - if not \"the greatest Polish poet\" ever \\- Le\u015bmian is certainly one of the most interesting artists of the interwar period, creator of a uniquely stylised Polish folk ballad and profoundly personal - and, nevertheless, popular - metaphysical lyrics. In addition, he is frequently mentioned as the most notable poet of erotic verses in the history of the Polish language. ==Bibliography== * \"Sad rozstajny\", (Bifurcated Orchard, Warsaw, 1912) * \"Klechdy sezamowe\" (Sesame Tales, Warsaw, 1913) * \"Przygody Sindbada \u017beglarza\" (Adventures of Sindbad the Sailor, Warsaw, 1913) * \"\u0141\u0105ka\" (Meadow, Warsaw, 1920) * \"Nap\u00f3j cienisty\", (Shadowy Drink, Warsaw, 1936) * \"Dziejba le\u015bna\" (Forest Happenings, Warsaw, 1938) * \"Klechdy polskie\" (Polish Tales, London 1956) * \"Skrzypek op\u0119tany\" (Possessed Violin Player, Warsaw, 1985) * \"Pochmiel ksi\u0119\u017cycowy\" (Russian, Lunar the-day-after, Warsaw, 1987; Polish translation by Jerzy Ficowski) * \"Zdziczenie obyczaj\u00f3w po\u015bmiertnych\" (Savagery of Posthumous Habits, Cracow, 1998) ==Footnotes== ==See also== * Polish literature * List of Poles ==References== * * * ==Further reading== * Mortkowicz-Olczakowa, Hanna (1961).
