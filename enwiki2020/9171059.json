Perfecto is a secondary brand of \"lancer fronted\" leather motorcycle jackets designed by Irving Schott and manufactured by American clothing company Schott NYC. The first jacket was introduced in 1928,Fashion in Popular Culture: Literature, Media and Contempora by Joseph Hancock, Toni Johnson-Woods, Vicki Karaminas, Intellect Books, 2013 , making it the first such styled leather motorcycle jacket. They were worn by such icons as Marlon Brando in the 1953 seminal movie The Wild One,International Directory of Company Histories, Volume 67 by Jay P. Pederson University of California, 2005 p.338 by punk rock pioneers The Ramones in the 1970s and styled by fashion designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier in the 1980s.Nothing in itself: complexions of fashion, Volume 24 of Theories of Contemporary Culture Series, Herbert Blau, Indiana University Press, 1999 Established as a manufacturer of motorcycle clothing since 1913,WALNECK'S CLASSIC CYCLE TRADER, DECEMBER 2005, Causey Enterprises, LLC Schott, a Russian immigrant, named the brand after his favorite cigar as he did not think his Jewish family name would sell the garments. It is said to be the first such jacket designed to feature a zipper and came to define the look of motorcycle jackets since Out Sep 2005, Vol. 14, No. 3, ISSN 1062-7928, Here Publishing Schott Bros later manufactured a very similar jacket for the Beck label, of which he was previously a representative, called the Beck 333 Northeaster and in the late 1940s, Schott Bros introduced a new jacket based on the original Perfecto design called the 613. It was soon nicknamed the \"One Star\" because it had a star on each shoulder epaulette. These jackets have a snug, almost tailored fit, which is suited for motorcycle riding but are short by today's standards. ==Perfecto timeline== The 613 and 618 Perfectos have been produced for more than 50 years, so finding out when a vintage jacket was made can be difficult.

In The Wild One, the stars on the epaulettes and the snaps on the collar of Marlon Brando's jacket were not original, but added to the jacket. Its popularity and connection to The Wild One movie led to it being banned from sale in many districts of the England and USA and becoming a symbol of rebellious youth.The Fashion Reader: Second Edition, Linda Welters, Abby Lillethun, Linda Welters, Berg, 2011 , ===Early 1960s=== Jackets are made out of steerhide.
