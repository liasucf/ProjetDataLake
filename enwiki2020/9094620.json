    "text": "The Rio Grande Valley Vipers are an American professional basketball team based in Edinburg, Texas. The Vipers compete in the NBA G League, and play their home games at the Bert Ogden Arena. The Vipers have won three league titles in 2010, 2013, and 2019, most for any club in league history. The Vipers entered a single-partnership affiliation agreement with the Houston Rockets during the 2009\u201310 season. Previously, they were also affiliated with the Cleveland Cavaliers for 2007\u201308 and the New Orleans Hornets from 2007 to 2009. ==History== After the finish of the 2006\u201307 season, the D-League announced an expansion to Hidalgo, Texas, with the team name \"Rio Grande Valley Vipers\". In their debut season, 2007\u201308, they finished with a 21\u201329 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs. In 2008\u201309, they finished with the same record, failing to advance to the playoffs for the second year in a row. In 2009, the Vipers and the Houston Rockets entered into a single affiliation partnership in which the Rockets controlled the Vipers' basketball operations while the franchise remains under local ownership by Alonzo Cantu. The result paid immediate dividends in the 2009\u201310 season, as the Vipers enjoyed their most successful season. Led by league MVP Mike Harris, and coach of the year Chris Finch, the Vipers went 34\u201316, tops in the Western Conference, and earned the franchise's first playoff berth. In the playoffs, the Vipers beat both Reno and Austin in 3 games, and swept Tulsa in the Finals to earn the franchise's first championship. In 2013, the Vipers won their second title over the Santa Cruz Warriors. Andrew Goudelock won the NBA Development League Most Valuable Player Award and got called up by the Los Angeles Lakers. In November 2013, the Vipers announced Gianluca Pascucci as the general manager and Nevada Smith as the head coach. On February 26, 2015, the Vipers broke ground on a new arena in Edinburg called Bert Ogden Arena and was originally scheduled for completion in October 2016. The arena was reportedly initially designed to house 8,500 seats, along with being a venue used for entertainment. The Vipers are the main tenant and operator (while the City of Edinburg will own the arena), and there will be a 40-by-20 foot jumbotron, the largest in the league. The arena was funded by sales taxes and cost an estimated $68 million, with nearly half being funded privately. After a few delays, the new arena was announced to have a grand opening in June 2018, with the Vipers beginning play in the arena for the 2018\u201319 season, and an estimated end cost of $88 million. On August 18, 2015, the Vipers named Matt Brase their new head coach. On April 12, 2019, the Vipers won their third championship in a 129\u2013112 game three win against the Long Island Nets. ==Season-by-season== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text- align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Season !rowspan=2|Division !colspan=4|Regular season !rowspan=2|Playoffs |- !Finish !!Wins !!Losses !!Pct. |- | colspan=7 style=\";\"|Rio Grande Valley Vipers |- |2007\u201308 || Southwestern || 5th || 21 || 29 || .420 || |- |2008\u201309 || Southwestern || 4th || 21 || 29 || .420 || |- |2009\u201310 || Western || 1st || 34 || 16 || .680 ||align=left| Won First Round (Reno) 2\u20131 Won Semifinals (Austin) 2\u20131 Won D-League Finals (Tulsa) 2\u20130 |- |2010\u201311 || Western || 2nd || 33 || 17 || .660 ||align=left| Won First Round (Bakersfield) 2\u20131 Won Semifinals (Reno) 2\u20130 Lost D-League Finals (Iowa) 1\u20132 |- |2011\u201312 || Western || 5th || 24 || 26 || .480 || |- |2012\u201313 || Central || 1st || 35 || 15 || .700 ||align=left| Won First Round (Maine) 2\u20130 Won Semifinals (Tulsa) 2\u20130 Won D-League Finals (Santa Cruz) 2\u20130 |- |2013\u201314 || Central || 3rd || 30 || 20 || .600 ||align=left| Won First Round (Iowa) 2\u20131 Lost Semifinals (Santa Cruz) 1\u20132 |- |2014\u201315|| Southwest || 3rd || 27 || 23 || .540 || |- |2015\u201316|| Southwest || 2nd || 29 || 21 || .580 ||align=left| Lost First Round (Austin) 1\u20132 |- |2016\u201317|| Southwest || 2nd || 32 || 18 || .640 ||align=left| Won First Round (Los Angeles) 2\u20131 Won Conf.
