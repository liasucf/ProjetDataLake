In 2019, former Xseed localization producer Brittany Avery discovered that she was not credited for her work on the enhanced PlayStation 4 port of The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel after leaving the company the previous year. As a result, Xseed revealed their policy of not crediting staff members in games if they are no longer employed at the company at the time it releases. The practice, also done by some other companies in the industry, was widely criticized. ==Games== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- ! Title !
