Approximately 90% of government sourced data has a location component. Location information (known by the many names mentioned here) is stored in a geographic information system (GIS). There are also many different types of geodata, including vector files, raster files, geographic databases, web files, and multi-temporal data. ==Fields of study== Geographic data and information are the subject of a number of overlapping fields of study, mainly: * Geocomputation * Geographic information science * Geoinformatics * Geomatics * Geovisualization This is in addition to other more specific branches, such as: * Cartography * Geodesy * Geography * Geostatistics * Photogrammetry * Remote sensing * Spatial data analysis * Surveying * Topography ==See also== * Earth observation data * Geographic feature * Georeferencing * Geospatial intelligence ==References== ==Further reading== * Roger A.
