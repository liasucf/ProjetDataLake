    "text": "The Minyungbal, also written Minjungbal, are an indigenous Australian people of New South Wales who speak the Minyungbal language. ==Name== Their ethnonym derives from their word for 'what'(minjung), meaning literally 'people who say 'minjung' for the idea of 'what'. ==Country== According to Norman Tindale, the Minyungbal held some of territory running northwards from Cape Byron as far as Southport. Their inland extension ran to Murwillumbah and Nerang Creek. ==Mythology== The origin story of the Minyungal concerns the legend of three brothers, each of whom established one of the tribes of the area. It tells of the arrival to this part of the eastern Australian coastline by 3 men/mythical culture heroes (Berru\u0121, Momm\u00f3m and Yabur\u00f3ng)and their wives and children in a canoe. > Long ago, Berru\u0121 together with Momm\u00f3m (and) Yab\u00farong came to this land. They > came with their wives and children in a great canoe, from an island across > the sea. As they came near the shore, a woman on the land made a song that > raised a storm which broke the canoe in pieces, but all the occupants, after > battling with the waves, managed to swim ashore. This is how 'the men' the > pai\u0121\u00e5l black race, came to this land.The pieces of the canoe are to be seen > to this day. If any one will throw a stone and strike a piece of the canoe, > a storm will arise, and the voices of Berr\u00fa\u0121 and his boys will be heard > calling to one another, amidst the roaring elements. The pieces of the canoe > are certain rocks in the sea. > At Ballina, Berr\u00fag looked around and said, nyu\u0121? and all the pai\u0121\u00e5l about > there say nyu\u0121 to the present day. On the Tweed he said, \u0121ando? (ngahndu)and > the Tweed paig\u00e5l say \u0121ando to the present day. This is how the blacks came > to have different dialects. Berr\u00fa\u0121 and his brothers came back to the > Brunswick River, where he made a fire, and showed the pai\u0121\u00e5l how to make > fire. He taught them their laws about the kipp\u00e5ra, and about marriage and > food. After a time, a quarrel arose, and the brothers fought and separated, > Momm\u00f3m going south, Yabur\u00f3ng west, and Berr\u00fa\u0121 keeping along the coast. This > is how the pai\u0121\u00e5l were separated into tribes. ==Alternative names== * Minjangbal (heard at Woodenbong in 1938). * Minyung * Minyowa * Gendo.
