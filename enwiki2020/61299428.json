    "text": "\"Send Her to Heaven\" is a song by American rock band The All-American Rejects, released as the stand-alone single from their Send Her to Heaven EP on July 16, 2019. \"Send Her to Heaven\" was released alongside two another songs, \"Gen Why? (DGAF)\" and \"Demons\", in addition to an accompanying music video for the single. == Background and composition == \"Send Her to Heaven\" was written by Tyson Ritter and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer during a writing session between the two frontmen. This marks the second collaboration between the two, after they wrote \"Put Me Back Together\" for Weezer's Raditude alongside the band's founder and guitarist Nick Wheeler. All three songs featured on the EP were intended to be released years prior, but due to scheduling conflicts and the bands departure from Interscope Records, they were shelved indefinitely. The original plan was to release them after Sweat. Ritter stated their former label was skeptical to release \"DGAF\", the intended lead single of their permanently shelved fifth album. Ritter also stated fans can \"absolutely\" expect another Rejects album in the future.https://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/the-all-american-rejects- comeback-interview-send-her-to-heaven Wheeler also stated in an interview with Alternative Press that fans can expect another album in the future.https://www.altpress.com/features/the-all-american-rejects-send-her-to- heaven-video-interview/ == Music video == The music video for \"Send Her to Heaven\" was released simultaneously with the EP on July 16.
