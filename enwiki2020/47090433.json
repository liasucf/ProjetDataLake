    "text": "\"Was There Anything I Could Do?\" is a song by the Australian alternative rock band The Go-Betweens that was issued as the second single from their sixth album 16 Lovers Lane. The song was released 3 October 1988 by Beggars Banquet Records in the UK and Mushroom Records in Australia but failed to chart in either region. It was released as a promotional single in the US by Capitol Records and charted on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks charts in the United States, peaking at No. 16. \"Was There Anything I Could Do?\" was not necessarily the unanimous choice by all members of the band, with claims by some that they wanted Forster's \"Clouds\" whilst McLennan pushed for the song as it was more driving and anthemic. == Cover versions == The song was covered by Max\u00efmo Park and included on a limited edition compilation album, released in July 2008 to celebrate the launch of Independents Day. In 2010 a cover of the song by The Buzzards, was included on a Go-Betweens tribute album, Right Here. Franz Ferdinand in November 2013 covered the song on Triple J's Like a Version programme. In 2014 a cover of the song by Missy Higgins was included on her album, Oz. == Track listing == === Original 7\" Vinyl release=== # \"Was There Anything I Could Do?\" - 3:06 # \"Rock and Roll Friend\" - 3:30 ===Original 12\" Vinyl release=== # \"Was There Anything I Can Do?\" - 3:06 # \"Rock and Roll Friend\" - 3:30 # \"Mexican Postcard\" - 2:13 ===Original CD single release=== # \"Was There Anything I Can Do?\" - 3:06 # \"Rock and Roll Friend\" - 3:30 # \"Mexican Postcard\" - 2:13 # \"Bye Bye Pride\" - 4:06 == Release history == {|class=\"wikitable\" !
