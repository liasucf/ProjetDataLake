    "text": "Sangham () is a 1954 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced by M. Murugan, M. Saravanan and M. Kumaran under the AVM Productions banner and directed by M. V. Raman. It stars Vyjayanthimala and Anjali Devi in lead role alongside N. T. Rama Rao and Sundaram Balachander in supporting roles and music composed by R. Sudarsanam. ==Plot== The story is a tale of two friends, Rani (Vyjayanthimala) and Kamini (Anjali Devi). Rani is a feminist to the core. Kamini's father Ramanatham (Chittoor V. Nagaiah), a man of progressive views, had married a woman from another caste and so finds it difficult to get a groom for his daughter. One day, Rani and Kamini have an altercation with medicos Raja (N. T. Rama Rao) and Chandram (S. Balachander). Raja is attracted by Kamini's simplicity and beauty, while Chandram falls for Rani. Raja's father Seetharamanjaneya Das (S. V. Ranga Rao) wants his son to marry the girl of his choice, but the mother Abbayamma (Rushyendramani) counters her husband's views. Raja marries Kamini without informing his parents. Due to a plot hatched by Yeka Kannaiah (Ramana Reddy), who has an eye on Kamini, Raja misunderstands her and, in a fit of anger, agrees to marry the girl of his father's choice. And this girl is none other than Rani, who, not knowing that Kamini had married Raja, agrees to marry him. Just then Chandram steps in and the story ends on a happy note with Raja realizing his folly, a changed Seetharamanjaneya Das accepting Kamini as his daughter-in-law and Rani marrying Chandram. ==Cast== *Vyjayanthimala as Rani *Anjali Devi as Kamini *N.
