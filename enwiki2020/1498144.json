    "text": "Martin McLean Buchan (born 6 March 1949 in Aberdeen) is a Scottish former international footballer. He played as a centre back for Aberdeen, Manchester United and Oldham Athletic. He also played in 34 international matches for Scotland between 1971 and 1978 including at two World Cups. Buchan later managed Burnley. ==Personal life== Buchan's father, Martin senior, and brother George both played for Aberdeen. Martin Buchan's son, Jamie, played with Aberdeen, Dundee United and Partick Thistle. ==Playing career== ===Aberdeen=== Buchan started his career with his home town club, Aberdeen. He captained the team when they won the 1970 Scottish Cup Final 3-1 against Jock Stein's Celtic. ===Manchester United=== Buchan was signed by Manchester United manager Frank O'Farrell on 29 February 1972 for \u00a3120,000, and at the time was the club's record signing. His first game for United came on 4 March 1972 against Tottenham in the First Division. He was unable to prevent United from suffering relegation to the Second Division in 1973\u201374, his first season as club captain following the retirement of Bobby Charlton. However, United bounced back at the first attempt as Second Division champions. Buchan helped United win the 1977 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, which they won 2\u20131.
