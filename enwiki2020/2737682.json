These facilities are located within the provincial territory of Diyarbak\u0131r, at a distance of 50 kilometres to Diyarbak\u0131r city centre. More specifically, the dam and the hydroelectric power plant are located in E\u011fil district, at a distance of 800 metres from the point of junction of the streams of Maden Stream and Dibni to form the Tigris, and 22 kilometres downstream of the Kralk\u0131z\u0131 Dam. Construction works were started in 1986 and the dam was completed in 1997. The dam has an installed hydroelectric capacity of 110 MW and is designed to ultimately irrigate 128,080 hectares. In 2001 a water transmission line and a water treatment plant were commissioned that provided about 85% of the drinking water for the city of Diyarbakir in 2010. In 2018 a gate of the dam broke the water lever decreased and a part of a village re-emerged in the E\u011fil district. ==References== * * GAP Regional Development Administration - Impounding started at Kralk\u0131z\u0131 and Dicle Dams * www.un.org.tr/undp/Gap.htm - United Nations Southeast Anatolia Sustainable Human Development Program (GAP) * www.ecgd.gov.uk Data sheet ==External links== * www.gap.gov.tr - Official GAP web site Category:Dams in Diyarbak\u0131r Province Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Turkey Category:Southeastern Anatolia Project Category:Dams completed in 1997 Category:Rock-filled dams Category:Dams on the Tigris River ",
