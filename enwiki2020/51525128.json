    "text": "Biological globalization has been defined as \"the spread of plants domesticated in one area to favorable environments around the world\". Columbian Exchange is a classic example of biological globalization. A growing and changing human population plays an important part on what plants are moved to new locations and which are left untouched. Early signs of biological globalization can be traced back to the mid-1860s. Wheat is an example of biological globalization that appeared early in the developmental timeline. Global trade was the beginning of biological globalization that integrated plants into new environments.
