    "text": "English 31 is a not-for-profit association, based in Toulouse area, providing high-quality English education to 6- to 18-year-old bi-lingual students schooled in the French system. It is a voluntary association in France (Association loi 1901) working in partnership with the \u00c9ducation Nationale and supported by its principal industrial partner, Airbus. It offers the teaching of English within the French school system to pupils who are fluent English speakers. Four to six hours of lessons a week are given by native English- speaking teachers with British teaching qualifications. The main aims are to develop reading and writing skills and an understanding of English-speaking culture. Primary level education is offered at the \u00c9cole Primaire Lucie Aubrac in Colomiers. Pupils aged six to ten (CP to CM2) have four hours weekly, working on reading and writing skills. Secondary education is organised in partnership with the Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo. Pupils at the coll\u00e8ge have six hours a week of English literature and history in English. Pupils at the Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo prepare for the International Baccalaur\u00e9at. ==About== The Section Internationale organises and delivers English lessons to children whose mother tongue is English, or who have proven spoken and written fluency in the language, and who are integrated into the French school system. The broad aim is to maintain a child's proficiency in English while she or he progresses through the French educational system. The bilingual system also enables a pupil to re-integrate into an English-speaking educational system whenever necessary and at whatever level, or to continue within the French educational system up to university level. ===Organisation=== The Section Internationale operates in the following schools, all in Colomiers: * Primary (\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire) Ecole primaire Lucie Aubrac (ages 6 \u2013 11) * Secondary (coll\u00e8ge) Coll\u00e8ge Victor Hugo (ages 11 \u2013 15) * Secondary (lyc\u00e9e) Lyc\u00e9e International (ages 15 \u2013 18) A programme of English integrated into the weekly programme at Lucie Aubrac exists at Primary level only. At secondary level, pupils must be registered full-time in the appropriate school in which English lessons are organised. ===The lessons=== At primary level, in the integrated programme, four hours of lessons are provided per week, incorporated into the standard French Primary timetable (24 hours per week). In the weekly programme 2 \u00bd hours of English are provided per week on Wednesday afternoon. At coll\u00e8ge level, six hours of lessons are provided per week, incorporated into the standard French coll\u00e8ge timetable, taking place when French pupils learn English as a foreign language. At lyc\u00e9e level four hours of English are provided per week in Seconde and Premi\u00e8re, incorporated into the standard French lyc\u00e9e timetable. This rises to six hours in Terminale if students decide to take the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at (OIB) in English. ==Schools== ===Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo=== The lyc\u00e8e Victor Hugo, a state Lyc\u00e9e Polyvalent International opened in September 1984 and serves the community of Colomiers, a town of 40,207 inhabitants on the western edge of Toulouse. The school has a total of 1,500 pupils from the ages of fifteen to eighteen. Among the pupils are English, American and German children whose parents work in the area. Many English-speaking parents are employed by Airbus; others work for local companies. The German pupils attend their own school within the lyc\u00e9e, having all lessons in their mother tongue and eventually taking the Abitur, the German university entrance examination. The English-speaking pupils are completely integrated into the French educational system and take the French Baccalaur\u00e9at (see OIB Section). In order that they develop complete fluency in the language, English-speaking pupils have special lessons given by teachers of the Section Internationale of the lyc\u00e9e while their French colleagues have lessons in English as a foreign language. ===Coll\u00e9ge Victor Hugo=== Housed within the Lyc\u00e9e building, this \"Coll\u00e8ge d'Enseignement Secondaire\" teaches pupils for the first four years of their secondary education. It is a small coll\u00e8ge, having only 200 pupils in all. It specialises in English and German teaching. Section Internationale pupils receive six hours of English tuition per week. For the rest of their programme they are taught by French teachers in classes with their French colleagues. The French, German and British teaching staff work in close co-operation, and trilingual programmes of study for all pupils also form part of the international education offered in this establishment. The programme is especially appropriate for pupils with an international bilingual background in education. At the end of the four-year cycle pupils transfer into the lyc\u00e9e. ===The Programmes=== The programme of work is similar to that of schools in England and based upon the English National Curriculum until the end of Key Stage Four. All English-speaking pupils may join the scheme however, regardless of nationality. At the age of fifteen/sixteen, pupils are entered for English GCSE. These qualifications provide proof of the successful candidate's proficiency in English. In the final two years of the lyc\u00e9e, Section Internationale students follow the English and history/Geography programmes of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at (OIB), which are jointly run by the Section Internationale's sponsors and Education Nationale, the French national education authority. ==Option Internationale Baccalaur\u00e9at== Not to be confused with the Baccalaur\u00e9at International (based in Switzerland), the OIB (Option Internationale au Baccalaur\u00e9at) is organised by the French Education Nationale and offers formal recognition at Baccalaur\u00e9at level of the bilingual competence of the pupils. The OIB examination is administered via a 1901 Association whose members are the various Sections Internationales that offer the OIB as part of their curriculum. This Association is called ASIBA (Association de Sections Internationales Britanniques et Anglophones). == Conditions of Entry == Entry into the \"Section Internationale \u2013 Britannique\" at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e Victor Hugo rests with the school authorities. However, pupils who are selected by the school to follow the International (British) programme must belong to English 31. English 31's participation in the selection process is limited to an assessment of a pupil's ability to follow the programme. The test takes place in the Lyc\u00e9e/Coll\u00e8ge Victor Hugo during May. The test is a two-hour test comprising a piece of extended writing (i.e. an essay) and a comprehension test. Candidates do not have to be British or native English speakers but they have to have a level of spoken and written English which will allow them to benefit from the English programme delivered by the Section. Pupils whose mother tongue is not English are tested following application to the section. If they are considered to have the level required they will be admitted to the section subject to the availability of places within the appropriate English class and to the availability of places within the appropriate French class for those candidates applying for a full-time place at Lucie Aubrac or Victor Hugo. Pupils are expected to make progress in English during the year. Assessment of progress is based upon results of standardised tests taken in March/April and upon the reports of the class teachers. If a pupil has not made satisfactory progress, parents will be requested to withdraw their child from the programme at the end of the school year. Weekly homework is set for the pupils and this is a compulsory part of the programme. Pupils who frequently fail to produce homework will be considered as not making satisfactory progress. ==Committee 2020-2021 ==english31.org President: Garrett Smith Treasurer: Adrian Kitcher Secretary: Penny Dickinson HR: Catherine Bortolotti Communication: Jay Russell Social Events: Cecile Poncon, Celia Green & Frank Delarue Learning and Education: Jenni Reid ==References== http://www.english31.org/ Category:Education in Toulouse ",
