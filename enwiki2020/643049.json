In the early Middle Ages, a fortified settlement of the Old Prussians existed at the site, conquered by the Teutonic Knights in 1236. The castle was captured by the Poles after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj\u00f3w s\u0142owia\u0144skich, Tom XII, Warsaw, 1892, p. 52 Town rights were granted to the settlement in 1416 and confirmed by King Sigismund II Augustus in 1553.S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj\u00f3w s\u0142owia\u0144skich, Tom XII, Warsaw, 1892, p. 53 In 1441 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule,Karol G\u00f3rski, Zwi\u0105zek Pruski i poddanie si\u0119 Prus Polsce: zbi\u00f3r tekst\u00f3w \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142owych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna\u0144, 1949, p.

In 1466 by the Second Peace of Toru\u0144 the town was finally renounced by the Teutonic KnightsG\u00f3rski, p. 106 and integrated with the Kingdom of Poland. As part of Poland, the town functioned as a seat of the Sztum County in Malbork Voivodeship (1466-1772) and a place to hold the voivodeship's sejmiks (regional court sessions). The Sztum Castle was the seat of the local starosts.
