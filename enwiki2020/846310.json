    "text": "Hans Moser (6 August 1880 \u2013 19 June 1964) was an Austrian actor who, during his long career, from the 1920s up to his death, mainly played in comedy films. He was particularly associated with the genre of the Wiener Film. Moser appeared in over 150 films. ==Biography== Born Johann Julier in Vienna, Moser very often portrayed the man in the street, typically someone else's subordinate - servant, waiter, porter, shopkeeper, coachman, petty bureaucrat, etc. Also always he played honest, moral and well-intentioned people who, unable to keep cool and think clearly in crucial situations, get themselves and everyone around them into all kinds of trouble. As the father of a beautiful daughter - often widowed - he was the stubborn one who realizes only at the end of the movie, when all cases of mistaken identity have been cleared up and all secrets are revealed, that he has been terribly wrong all the time. Moser was particularly known for mumbling indistinctly for comic effect rather than pronouncing words and sentences clearly, and also for failing to finish his sentences - which, combined with his moderate Viennese dialect, made it hard for non-native speakers of Austrian German to understand what he was saying. In Moser's comedy films, Paul H\u00f6rbiger, Theo Lingen, Oskar Sima, and Annie Rosar were some of his congenial partners. However Moser was also a serious actor, especially on the stage and, towards the end of his life, on television. In many musical films, Moser can also be heard interpreting a Wienerlied, more likely than not at a Heuriger. Moser performing in 1942 During the Nazi regime, Moser refused to divorce his Jewish wife Blanca Hirschler. Hans Moser died in Vienna in 1964, aged 83. His continuing popularity is attested to by the fact that his style of speaking is still being parodied, often by very young entertainers. ==Select filmography== A bust of Moser in Hans Moser Park in Hietzing * The Tales of Hoffman (1923) * The City Without Jews (1924, based on the novel by Hugo Bettauer) * Red Heels (1925) * Grandstand for General Staff (1926) * Madame Dares an Escapade (1927) * The Family without Morals (1927) * Darling of the Gods (1930) * Money on the Street (1930) * Marriage with Limited Liability (1931) * No Money Needed (1932) * Madame Wants No Children (1933) * Gently My Songs Entreat (1933) * The Young Baron Neuhaus (1934) * Spring Parade (1934) * Polish Blood (1934) * The Secret of Cavelli (1934) * Frasquita (1934) * Suburban Cabaret (1935) * Winter Night's Dream (1935) * The World's in Love (1935) * Heaven on Earth (1935) * Circus Saran (1935) * Last Stop (1935) * A Hoax (1936) * ' (1936) * Hannerl and Her Lovers (1936) * Ungek\u00fcsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn (1936, alongside Liane Haid) * Fr\u00e4ulein Veronika (1936) * Court Theatre (1936) * ' (1937) * Mother Song (1937) * My Son the Minister (1937) * The Scoundrel (1939) * Anton the Last (1939) * Opera Ball (1939) * The Unfaithful Eckehart (1940) * My Daughter Lives in Vienna (1940) * Vienna Tales (1940) * Roses in Tyrol (1940, alongside Johannes Heesters) * Love is Duty Free (1941) * Vienna Blood (1942) * Black on White (1943) * Abenteuer im Grand Hotel (1943) * Mask in Blue (1943) * Schrammeln (1944) * Viennese Girls (1945, released 1949) * Renee XIV (1946, uncompleted) * Der Hofrat Geiger (1947) * The Singing House (1948) * ' (1950) * Kissing Is No Sin (1950) * Theodore the Goalkeeper (1950) * Hallo Dienstmann (1952) (a typical Antel movie) * ' (1952) * Rose of the Mountain (1952) * Dutch Girl (1953) * To Be Without Worries (1953) * The Uncle from America (1953) * The Three from the Filling Station (1955) * The Congress Dances (1955) * Yes, Yes, Love in Tyrol (1955) * As Long as the Roses Bloom (1956} * Opera Ball (1956) * My Aunt, Your Aunt (1956) * Emperor's Ball (1956) * Hello Taxi (1958) * Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald (TV play, 1961, based on the play Tales from the Vienna Woods by \u00d6d\u00f6n von Horvath) * Mariandl (1961) * Die Fledermaus (1962, playing the non-singing role of Frosch, the drunken jailer) * ' (1963, TV film) ==Notes== ==External links== * *Photographs of Hans Moser Category:1880 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Austrian male film actors Category:Austrian male silent film actors Category:Wienerlied Category:People from Margareten Category:Burials at the Vienna Central Cemetery Category:20th-century Austrian male actors ",
