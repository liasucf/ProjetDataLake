    "text": "LISA is the USENIX special interest group for system administrators. LISA was known officially as the System Administrators Guild until November 2003; from 2003 to 2010, it was known as SAGE. In March 2016 it was announced that LISA was being retired. ==Major activities== * Co-sponsors the annual system administration conference, also known as LISA. * Hosts several technical and professional mailing lists. * Provides a job listing service. * Compiles an annual salary survey of system administrators' salaries keyed to many variables. * Publishes a series of short topics booklets in the field of system administration. * Establishes and promotes a code of ethics for system administrators. * Supports local user groups. * Offers an IRC channel. * Presents an annual award for outstanding contributions to the field of system administration. ==Proposed spinoff== In June 2004, SAGE was dissolved as a Special Technical Group to prepare for a spin-off from its parent organization, USENIX. On October 27, 2005, the USENIX Board, by a 4-4 vote, failed to approve a motion to progress the separation of SAGE from USENIX, declaring instead that SAGE is better as a suborganization. This contributed to the formation of LOPSA by individuals involved in the aborted spinoff. ==See also== *League of Professional System Administrators *SAGE-AU (Australia) *System Administrators Guild of Ireland ==References== ==External links== * Official website * SAGE@GUUG (Germany) * cSAGE Certification * USENIX * LOPSA - League of Professional Systems Administrators Category:Information technology organizations Category:Professional associations based in the United States Category:System administration ",
