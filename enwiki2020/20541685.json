Born in Middlesbrough, in north-east England, Collinson was spotted playing for Urmston Boys Club towards the end of the Second World War and joined Manchester United as an amateur in May 1946. He turned professional in September 1946, before making his debut for the club in a scoreless draw away to Aston Villa on 2 November 1946. He went on a run of seven consecutive games, culminating with a 2\u20131 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 14 December 1946. However, he was not able to claim the \"number one\" jersey from Jack Crompton on a regular basis and never played for the club again, fading into obscurity. ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com Category:1920 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Footballers from Middlesbrough Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
