The album followed significant lineup changes in the band of whom the only original member is keyboardist, songwriter and founder Steve Williams. In May 2010, it was announced that the new vocalist and guitarist were Chitral \"Chity\" Somapala and Gavin Owen. The album was the first album to include the new lineup with Chitral \"Chity\" Somapala, Gavin Owen, Andy Midgley, Paul Finnie and Rich Smith.
