    "text": "Guy David (born 1957) is a French mathematician, specializing in analysis. ==Biography== David studied from 1976 to 1981 at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, graduating with Agr\u00e9gation and Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies (DEA). At the University of Paris-Sud (Paris XI) he received in 1981 his doctoral degree (Th\u00e8se du 3\u00e8me cycle) and in 1986 his higher doctorate (Th\u00e8se d'\u00c9tat) with thesis Noyau de Cauchy et op\u00e9rateurs de Cald\u00e9ron-Zygmund supervised by Yves Meyer. David was from 1982 to 1989 an attach\u00e9 de recherches (research associate) at the Centre de math\u00e9matiques Laurent Schwartz of the CNRS. At the University of Paris-Sud he was from 1989 to 1991 a professor and from 1991 to 2001 a professor first class, and is since 1991 a professor of the Classe exceptionelle. (with CV) David is known for his research on Hardy spaces and on singular integral equations using the methods of Alberto Calder\u00f3n. In 1998 David solved a special case of a problem of Vitushkin. Among other topics, David has done research on Painlev\u00e9's problem of geometrically characterizing removable singularities for bounded functions; Xavier Tolsa's solution of Painlev\u00e9's problem is based upon David's methods. With Jean-Lin Journ\u00e9 he proved in 1984 the T(1) Theorem, for which they jointly received the Salem Prize. The T(1) Theorem is of fundamental importance for the theory of singular integral operators of Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund type. David also did research on the conjecture of David Mumford and Jayant Shah in image processing and made contributions to the theory of Hardy spaces; the contributions were important for Jones' traveling salesman theorem in \\mathbb{R}^2. David has written several books in collaboration with Stephen Semmes. ==Awards and honors== * 1986 \u2014 Invited Speaker, International Congress of Mathematicians, Berkeley, CaliforniaDavid, Guy. \"Op\u00e9rateurs de Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund.\" In Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Berkeley, pp. 890-899. 1986. * 1987 \u2014 Salem Prize * 1990 \u2014 Prix IBM France * 1999 \u2014 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences * 2001 \u2014 Silver medal of the CNRS * 2004 \u2014 Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer Prize for the article Singular sets of minimizers for the Mumford-Shah functional. * 2004 \u2014 Prix Servant ==Articles== *Courbes corde-arc et espaces de Hardy g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s, Ann.
