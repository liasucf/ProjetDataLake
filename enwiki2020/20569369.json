In August 2009, VH1 canceled any showings of season three due to castmember Ryan Jenkins's involvement in the murder of Jasmine Fiore, as well as Jenkins's suicide. It had been revealed that Jenkins had been convicted for assault in 2007, but this had not been disclosed to VH1 or 51 Minds. The girls on the show consisted of Flavor of Love's Deelishis and Buckeey, Rock of Love's Lacey Conner and Marcia \"Brazil' Alves, Real Chance of Love's Bubbles, and For the Love of Ray J's Lil Hood, Cashmere, and Cocktail.
