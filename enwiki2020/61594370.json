    "text": "Constance Ella Glynn (born 16 March 1994) is an Internet celebrity, author, and cosplayer. ==Personal life== Glynn is from Hatfield, Hertfordshire. She and her brother attended St. Christopher School in Letchworth on a bursary. She took classes at Guildhall School of Music & Drama as a teenager. After graduating from the University of Sussex with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies in 2016, Glynn moved to London. Glynn is aromantic and bisexual. ==Career== Glynn started the Noodlerella blog on Tumblr, where she would post about Disney, anime, and video games. This translated into her YouTube channel, where she uploaded her first video doing Disney impressions in January 2013. She became known on the Internet for her pink-loving \"Noodlerella\" persona and fashion sense, impressions, and love of cartoons and Disney, and cosplay. In 2016, Glynn started a second channel, originally named NoodleVlogs and later Connie. Glynn voiced the role of Moxie Dewdrop in the UK edition of the 2016 DreamWorks film Trolls. In 2017, Glynn signed a three-book deal with the aim of five books with Penguin Random House for a young adult fairytale series The Rosewood Chronicles largely based on Glynn's own experiences at boarding school. The first installment in the series, Undercover Princess made her the top debut author in the young adult genre in the UK in 2017. Undercover Princess was followed by Princess-in-Practice and The Lost Princess in 2018 and 2019 respectively. With these came book tours. In 2018, Glynn moved away from her Noodlerella persona, and in August 2019, she rebranded away from \"the colour pink\" as part of her identity and aesthetic as she decided to focus more on writing. Glynn revealed the cover for Princess at Heart in October 2020, the fourth book in The Rosewood Chronicles series. It is set for a 2021 release. ==Bibliography== ===The Rosewood Chronicles=== *Undercover Princess (2017) *Princess in Practice (2018) *The Lost Princess (2019) *Princess at Heart (2021) ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
