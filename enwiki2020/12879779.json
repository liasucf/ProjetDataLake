    "text": "Nachume Miller (1949\u20131998) was an Israeli artist who immigrated to New York City in 1973, where he made a name for himself in the American Modern Art scene. Miller's parents were both Holocaust survivors. His father was a captain in the front lines of the Russian Army during World War II and his mother was a Lithuanian who had once been held captive in a concentration camp. Both escaped the Nazis, re-united and fled to Israel. Nachume was born during their voyage, in Frankfurt, Germany, on January 28, 1949. He grew up in the town of Holon, Israel, where he was inspired by his father who spent most of his post-war days carving elaborate wood sculptures of Cubist human forms. Nachume, on the contrary, excelled in painting. By the age of 16, Miller was painting elaborate surreal dream lands referencing religion, politics and the history of Modern Art. His earlier works show similarities to Hieronymus Bosch, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Francisco Goya. Miller was enlisted in the Israeli Army where he worked as one of Ariel Sharon's personal assistants and also fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He went to New York in 1966 to study at the School of Visual Arts, and joined the faculty in 1977 to teach painting and drawing. == Exhibitions == ;Selected One-Person Exhibitions * 1976: \"Drawing Show\", Bertha Urdang Gallery, New York * 1981: \"Figures\", A&M; Artwork, New York * 1988: Exit Art, New York; \"Projects: Nachume Miller\", Museum of Modern Art, New York * 1989: E.M.
