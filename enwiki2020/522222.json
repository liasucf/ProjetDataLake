    "text": "Universities in Greece form one part of constitutionally-recognized institutions with degree awarding powers. According to Greece's Constitution, higher education institutions (HEIs) include universities, polytechnics, some specialist HEIs, and formerly technological educational institutes (TEIs). In Greece, all universities are publicly owned and funded having state-accredited university title and authorization of university degree awarding powers at level 6 (first cycle qualification, bachelor's level) under the Bologna Process and the National Qualification Framework of Greece which is officially named Hellenic Qualification Framework (HQF; ). The power to award Greek university degrees is regulated by law and it is an offence for an institution to award a Greece university degree if it is not public and state-owned. The State University System of Greece operates on the term system of two semesters per academic year, shares a common national academic curriculum set forth by the Ministry of Education (\u03a5.\u03a0\u0391\u0399.\u0398.). ==Higher education institutions== Higher education institutions' (HEIs; ) undergraduate programmes in Greece are government funded and have free education without any payment of tuition fee. About one-fourth of postgraduate programmes are offered without tuition and 30% of students can be entitled to attend tuition-free postgraduate programmes after they are assessed on individual criteria. Framework and regulations for postgraduate studies The Hellenic Qualification Framework (HQF) sets out the different levels of education qualifications and the requirements for each of these and is linked to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), and thus to other qualifications frameworks across the European Union. The regulated framework for Greece higher education qualifications, which is tied to the HQF, covers degree-levels qualifications of Greece degree-awarding bodies and is linked to the Qualifications Framework in the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA) established by the Bologna process where Greece is a full member since 1999. Joining to the Bologna process Greece began education reforms in order to get higher education meeting the common European Union standards. Now the process is implemented in all higher education institutions. The programmes of EHEA are set at three levels of study which are usually referred to as the three cycle system. First (entry level), a four-year cycle of study at EQF level 6 to attain a bachelor's degree or its equivalent (; transliterated to Ptychio in dhimotiki from 1976\u2013present; or defunt ; Ptychion in polytonic, katharevousa up until 1976). The digital Historical Collection of Greece School Textbooks, Government Gazettes, and other papers, more than 6.000 books. A second cycle of study follows at EQF level 7 lasting one or two years to attain a master's degree () or equivalent, which is distinguished from a postgraduate diploma, typically having 120 ECTS, as opposed to a full master's degree which usually has 180. The third cycle of study at EQF level 8, lasting three years, awards a doctorate's degree () or equivalent. ==Universities and technical universities== Universities () can grant one or more of bachelor's, master's, integrated master's and doctorate's degrees. The undergraduate programme of study for most disciplines is four years with awarded qualification in line with the Bologna process legal equivalent to a bachelor's degree, 240 ECTS, at level 6 of Greece's National Qualification Framework (NQF), Page 27 to 49 European Qualifications Framework (EQF), or International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). The University Center of International Programmes of Studies (UCIPS) of the public International Hellenic University (IHU) offers postgraduate programmes fully taught in English. Technical universities, also known as polytechnics (), grant degrees at the integrated master's, master's, and doctorate level. In specific disciplines, only the undergraduate programme is five years with awarded qualification (Greek: \u0394\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1, Latinised version: Diploma) that is legally equivalent to an integrated master's degree, which is often the standard route to chartered status for a regulated profession in Greece. The integrated master's degree is a specialized degree corresponding to a master-level degree which has integrated part of an undergraduate degree. It is also called an undergraduate master's degree, where instead of studying for two separate degrees, a student will study for a single, longer programme. The most common integrated master's is in engineering, for example a Dipl.-Eng or Dip.Arch.Eng/M.Arch, and also others along with some programmes in the fine arts. In medical schools, six years of studying are required to earn a bachelor's degree. In addition to earning an academic degree in specific disciplines only, state license is required to practice independently within the country of Greece, and some disciplines have further licensing requirements to bestow a recognized appellation (chartered accountant, attorney at law, doctor of medicine, etc.). Diploma is a prerequisite for registration as a chartered professional, so it is also known as professional degree. The use of specific professional titles for some professions is legally regulated. For a regulated profession, access to professional practice requires holding a particular specific degree (e.g. professional degree), taken special exams that are required to earn state practice credential such as it must pass the National Council Licensure Examination, a period of practical training under supervision similar to internship, and/or registration with a professional body. ; University * Agricultural University of Athens \"The EEC was impressed by the high quality of undergraduate and postgraduate programs and faculty research. AUA is committed to competitive research and extension activities in both scientifically and economically important areas, notably in agriculture, food science and natural resource management.\" * Aristotle University of Thessaloniki \"AUTH from its inception to present time has a reputation of providing excellent education to its students in their respective fields of study. The research operations of the university are sizeable and impressive, both in the physical sciences and the humanities. They also include a few excellent examples of world-class research and recognition. The University has initiated the strategic planning process, which should be continued and completed.\" * Athens School of Fine Arts * Athens University of Economics and Business \"AUEB is a leading Greek institution in its field and stands well in comparison to international institutions attaining excellence in the areas of entrepreneurship and internationalisation and in its social involvement and contribution.\" * Democritus University of Thrace \"The report was honest and clear in pointing out strengths as well as weaknesses. One dissenting member who finds the final rating as \"Worthy of Merit\" views it as a rating of \u201cthe totality of the internal evaluation process\u201d with emphasis on the overall efficacy.\" * Harokopio University of Athens \"Consistently with its vision, Harokopio University addresses scientific areas that serve society, health education, technology and the environment. In considering further growth and academic development, the university should engage in more in-depth planning.\" * Hellenic Mediterranean University (formerly TEI of Crete) \"TEI Crete is blessed with a number of highly qualified academic faculty with internationally recognized research outputs.In general terms, there is a healthy underdog mentality to strive for improvement in research output and the institution appears to have a competitive status vis-\u00e0-vis other institutions. By design, the TEI of Crete overall deviates grossly from \"model 1 campus/HEI\". The Institution needs to resolve the inconsistencies in operations created by the dispersal of academic departments in different geographical areas. The mission of the Institution should be stated concisely.\" * Hellenic Open University \"HOU is a unique institution of HEI in Greece, offering distance learning degrees. The EEC has reached the conclusion that HOU meets our expectations in pursuing its academic and social mission. There is much that has been accomplished thus far and is now at a turning point that provides opportunities for strategic initiatives that will further raise its profile in Greece and abroad. HOU should consider raising the standard of its educational material and making it available in the open market.\" * International Hellenic University \"IHU should intensify efforts for the recruitment of international students. Some study programmes are rather overspecialized. A crucial step for the IHU\u2019s future development would be to improve and expand the university campus. For this reason it is important that IHU acquires the ownership of the campus and buildings.\" * Ionian University \"The Ionian University after 27 years of operation is one of the newest institutions of Higher Education in Greece, offering unique study programs for the new generation of Greek scientists ensuring high-level research in sectors with high social, scientific and economic added value and performance. The University needs important improvements in the strategic plan for high-level quality of research and a clear vision and policy of a coordinated process. The EEC finds that the Internationalization Strategy of the Institution needs further development.\" * National and Kapodistrian University of Athens \"The EEC\u2019s assessment is that UOA is worthy of merit. We conclude by pointing out that the recommendations indicated in our report are intended as ways to improve an already excellent Institution. The culture of excellence in research and teaching that the Institution has established for itself was appreciated by every member of the EEC.\" * National Technical University of Athens \"For the most part, NTUA appears to be well organized. It enjoys outstanding reputation thanks to a subset of its top-notch students and faculty that pursue a broad range of high-caliber research. Over the years, such a top-notch human capital has made major contributions to the Nation, and serves as shining ambassadors of Greek Science and Technology worldwide.\" * Panteion University \"Panteion University is a very strong academic institution in teaching and research. The structure of the institution provides a perfect environment for the evolution of intrainsitutional interdisciplinary research and education structures. However, there are still dormant possibilities that have to be exploited, in order to secure the future and the prosperity of the Institution in a rapidly changing world.\" * Technical University of Crete \"Two members of the EEC give a lower evaluation (positive) due to the fact that QA of the Institution is actually not in place and also that the absence of a feasible strategic plan hampers the Institution\u2019s operation and its readiness to change.\" * University of the Aegean \"Very limited infrastructure. Insufficient welfare and social services for students. Insufficient personnel (academic, administrative, and technical support) and low ratios of faculty members to students and administration members to faculty members. Limited financial resources from the state, affecting the general development of the institution. There is a general lack of certified procedural approaches, although it is clear that procedures at the UoA are increasingly systematized and formalised. The University should insist on the implementation of its strategic plan despite external adversities and further emphasize internationalization, intensify and systematise quest for external funding, both from the EU and from the private sector. Capitalize on their assets and good name of the University, its alumni, as well as on its unique geographical location-rebranding.\" * University of Crete \"Overall, the external evaluation committee was impressed by the commitment to excellence permeating all levels of the institution. For a relatively new university, UoC has made remarkable achievements in the Greek academic world and beyond. While there is a general acceptance of both internal and external evaluation, the institution needs to develop \"tighter\" formal processes for monitoring and recording the progress and implementation of changes. The institution needs to consider introducing mechanisms to further support faculty development and move expeditiously to further communicate and develop the strategic goals associated with the \u201c2020-2025\u201d vision statement.\" * University of Ioannina \"Overall, the University provides a positive and supportive environment for students and faculty. Further development of a mid-term strategic plan including feasibility studies, timelines, implementation plans, responsibilities and metrics (inclusive bottom up approach and stakeholders). Accelerate the pace of implementation of digital technologies for teaching and learning. Improve financial accounting and reporting.\" * University of Macedonia \"The UoM endeavours to play a central role as an academic institution in the Balkans. The general operation has been very positively evaluated and the EEC feels that the Institution has the potential to evolve into a major educational and cultural pole for northern Greece and the Balkans.\" * University of Patras \"The EEC evaluated and scored according to our estimate of where UPatras stands in relation to our understanding of an international norm of excellence. Although we are conscious of the severe constraints imposed by the Greek State, we have not used them as an excuse for not identifying areas of improvement. Please note that an EEC member gave a worthy of merit vote by taking into account with a heavier weight the negative influence of the external environment on the ability to plan, strategise and operate.\" * University of Peloponnese \"The UoP has high quality teaching staff. Also, the Institution has established good relationships with the community and its stakeholders. The Institution will benefit by developing more systematic approaches in the collection of data for the improvement of its programmes and internationalization strategy.\" * University of Piraeus \"University of Piraeus offers some unique programs in the undergraduate and Masters level that specifically address the needs of the economy, specific needs of important industries and those of the public sector. Specific strategies should be incorporated in the mission statement associated with specific measurable goals and objectives.\" * University of Thessaly \"UTH provides a positive and collegial work environment. The EEC believes that with hard work and dedication, the University of Thessaly will be able to reach its full potential in the near future.\" * University of West Attica (formerly TEI of Athens and TEI of Piraeus) \"The EEC has reached the conclusion that TEI-A is operating at a level of excellence that transcends expectations, with great enthusiasm and commitment. However, there are specific points of criticism that have been specifically addressed in this report. The EEC believes that by considering our suggestions TEI-A has an opportunity to set a national or even European standard in the field of higher technological education.\"\"PUAS is a modern, forwarding looking institution with a clear vision, committed to a process of continuous improvement. Recent successes in developing a research culture and running a wide range of MSc programs have paved the way for the potential introduction of third-cycle degree programs.\" * University of Western Macedonia \"The EEC has decided to give to UoWM a positive evaluation. UoWM has self-motivated, dynamic and recognized faculty. Several research units at UoWM are productive, visible, and deliver good quality research. The size, dispersion, and diversity of the Institution need to be thoroughly addressed, since they may produce serious obstacles to the viability of the Institution.\" * School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) \"Several research units at ASPETE are productive, visible, and deliver good- quality research. However, strategic planning designed with clear goals and timetables, though considered as crucial in all aspects, does not exist at the moment.

Founded in 1998, the Hellenic Colleges Association (HCA; ) is the representative official body for the Greece located private colleges. \"\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\" All the private colleges located in Greece are for-profit. Generally, any individual who wants to found a college in Greece must obtain a Higher Education Accreditation by the National Authority for Higher Education (NAHE) and a license by the Ministry of Education, but has no obligation to become a participatory member of HCA. The vast majority of colleges are offering programmes of study under franchise or validation agreements with universities established in other European Union countries, primarily in the UK, leading to degrees which are awarded directly by those universities. The monitoring of those agreements as well as of additional provisions for the operation of colleges is carried out by the Ministry of Education and confirmed by Parliament by a 2008 law. \"Foundation and operation of private colleges and other provisions.\" Amendments were passed in 2010, 2012 \"According to the laws 4093/12-11-2012 (Government Gazette 222 A\u2019) and 4111/25-1-2013 (Government Gazette 18 A\u2019), private colleges in Greece are non- formal post-secondary (post Lyceum) education service and training providers (non-tertiary) offer at least three years first cycle qualification programmes of study at Level 6 of ISCED (first higher education degree, bachelor\u2019s degree level) and/or postgraduate studies (graduate qualifications) exclusively with the legal form of Validation and Franchising agreements with Higher Education Institution (HEIs) from foreign countries, that are officially fully recognised and accredited from their country competence authorities. Pursuant to the Greek current constitutional prohibition of Article 16\u03a3 of Greek Parliament (Constitution of Greece - The Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes Resolves. PART II Individual and social rights. Article 16, education, art, science. As revised by the parliamentary resolution of May 27th 2008 of the VIII Revisionary Parliament), do not academically recognize in Greece all university qualification titles have been awarded by private colleges in Greece after completion studies have been taken place in Greece either by cooperating universities from foreign countries. The university study titles have been awarded from universities of foreign countries after completion studies have been taken place by cooperating private colleges in Greece, even they recognized in regards professional rights in Greece, do not accept from Greek universities to continue studies for the obtainment postgraduate (level 7 ISCED) or doctoral qualification (level 8 ISCED). The prohibition is in force in the Greece only, as Greece located private colleges graduates are normally accepted for continuous studies (master\u2019s degree level, doctor's degree level) from universities in foreign countries.\", 2013,, and 2014. They are also monitored by the respective educational authorities of the countries of the partnered universities, for example QAA and NARIC for a British university. One example of a college which neither operating as a franchise nor was validated through arrangements in the UK was the University of Indianapolis \u2013 Athens Campus, which ceased operations in July 2014. By contrast, this college was wholly owned and operated by its home campus, and is therefore accredited by the same agency which accredits the home campus. Consequently, students of the University of Indianapolis could switch between campuses at any time. Degrees, diplomas, certificates, and any other type of attestation awarded by universities in European Union and European Free Trade Association countries to students that have completed their studies in an accredited private college located in Greece, can be recognized as professionally equivalent \"in terms of the professional (practice) rights only\" () to higher education titles awarded in the formal Greek education system. Recognition of professional equivalence permits access to a specific economic activity that the title-holder can exercise on the same rules, rights, terms as holders of comparable titles of Greece HEIs education system. Recognition of legally-recognized professional degree rights in Greece can only be granted by the Independent Department of Implementation of European Legislation (ATEEN; \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bc\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2; \u0391.\u03a4.\u0395.\u0395.\u039d.) of the Ministry of Education (\u03a5.\u03a0\u0391\u0399.\u0398.), \"Invest in Greece and other provisions.\" \"The Greek Council for the Recognition of Professional Qualifications () was reformed and replaced by Independent Department of Implementation of European Legislation (ATEEN; \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bc\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2; \u0391.\u03a4.\u0395.\u0395.\u039d.)\" Professional equivalency recognition of the formal Higher Education (tertiary) qualifications as of the 2005 Directive of the European Parliament and Council, implemented domestically by a presidential decree in 2010.
