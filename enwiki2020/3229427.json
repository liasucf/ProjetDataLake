    "text": "A Fresh Aire Christmas is the second Christmas album and tenth studio album released by American musical group Mannheim Steamroller. The album was released in 1988 and was the last album to feature Eric Hansen as a member of the band. The album is the highest selling album in the Chip Davis/Mannheim Steamroller music catalog. When selecting the tracks, Chip Davis had requested of fans to submit three of their favorite Christmas songs. He then tabulated the results and sent a note of thanks and a copy of the album to those fans who had a song selected. Album sales were massive upon release in 1988. The album was a huge success and continues to be a huge seller 25 years since its original release. On June 21, 2004, A Fresh Aire Christmas was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of six million copies in the United States, making it one of the best-selling holiday albums in the U.S. Four of the album's tracks were included in the group's 2004 compilation Christmas Celebration. As of November 2014, A Fresh Aire Christmas is the sixth best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the U.S. for the Nielsen SoundScan era of music sales tracking (March 1991 \u2013 present), having sold 3,660,000 copies during this period according to SoundScan. The album has become the band's biggest success, even surpassing their mammoth first Christmas release four years earlier, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas. ==Track listing== #\"Hark!
