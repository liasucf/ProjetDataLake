It is one of South Australia's earliest established Primary Schools and currently has an enrolment of approximately 580 studentsDepartment of Education & Children Services (2007).

Sir John Rose, who was the chairman of the South Australia Company at the time it subdivided the district. The land was purchased for \u00a3800 in 1892, and the original building was planned to accommodate 500 children. The original school building comprised seven classrooms with verandahs and two shelter sheds at the back.Davies, Kerrie et al. (1993). Rose Park Primary School 1893 \u2013 1993. Lutheran Publishing House, Adelaide SA. . OCLC: 38327855 The school was opened on 30 January 1893 with C A Wittber Headmaster, 4 assistants and 294 pupils. By the end of the year, 591 children had enrolled. The eastern wing was built in 1899, to provide a total of 9 classrooms. The verandahs at the back were removed and a large classroom was added on each of the eastern and western corners. The Grant Avenue building was completed in 1923, and extensive alterations were carried out during 1977 to make it suitable for contemporary teaching methods.Rose Park Primary School (2006). History. Retrieved online 2 November 2007. The old St. Theodore's Church was purchased in 1924 for \u00a3925 and was opened as a woodwork centre in 1925. The building has served a number of roles such as a drama area, creative dance area and even as a lunch-time recreational area supervised by a roster of parents. After the opening of Linden Park Primary School, student numbers gradually declined, levelling off at around 400. Developments in the buildings since the 1950s have related to curriculum changes, rather than to pressures of numbers. Thus, the Grant Avenue building was remodelled as an Open Unit, in 1977 and subsequently re-divided in 1981. A strong library/resource centre developed, with particular space requirements. Activity rooms were set aside from ordinary classrooms for multi-purpose usage, assemblies, music, dance and drama and wet-weather activities. Since 1970 the school grounds have been expanded by the purchase of two properties adjoining the school on the east, three properties on Grant Avenue and the take-away shop on the corner of Alexandra Avenue and Victoria Terrace, previously known as Gurney Road. The closure of Victoria Terrace to through traffic in 1976 and the development of the park helped to reduce crowding. The 1989 re-routing of the service lane enabled the final linking up of the original school with the church building and the shop block. Adjoining houses east of the school on Grant Avenue were demolished and the two sites developed to form the \"block\" currently used for after-school sport. 1993 was the Centenary Year of the school and celebrations were held throughout the year. ==Headmaster / principal== {| class=wikitable style=\"background: #fffaef; border: 1px dotted gray;\" |- !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Name !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Years !style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |Notes |- | C.A.
