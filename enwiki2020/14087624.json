    "text": "John \"Jack\" Hallam (26 June 1869 \u2013 7 March 1949) was an English professional footballer who played as an outside right. He was capped at full international level for Wales. He played 133 games for Small Heath in the Football Alliance and the Football League, and also represented Oswestry Town, Swindon Town and Trowbridge Town. ==Career== Hallam was born in Oswestry, Shropshire, on the border with Wales, the eldest child of Lister Hallam of Hull, Yorkshire and Eliza Ann Bell of Leeds.1871 England Census Hallam started his football career with clubs in his native town. While with Oswestry Town he won international honours for Wales, on 23 February 1889 in a 4\u20131 defeat to England. A report of the match said that Hallam \"showed great speed but was evidently nervous and hesitated too much\". In 1890, he moved to Small Heath, then playing in the Football Alliance, and made more than 150 appearances for the club in all competitions. The strength of Hallam's game lay in his speed, and he formed fine partnerships on the right side with both Charlie Short and Billy Walton. In Small Heath's first Football League season, they won the inaugural Second Division championship; Hallam contributed 17 goals, and was only outscored by future England international Fred Wheldon.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 141. He also helped them to runners-up spot and promotion to the First Division the following year and played a further 18 months in the top flight.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 142\u201343. He then moved to Swindon Town, where he played for one season in the Southern League, followed by a season with Trowbridge Town in the Western League, then returning to Swindon for a final season in their Western League team. After football, he lived in Swindon, Wiltshire, where he worked as a fitter for the Great Western Railway.1901 England Census1911 England Census He died in the town in 1949, aged 80. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Oswestry Category:English footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Oswestry Town F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Trowbridge Town F.C. players Category:Football Alliance players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Western Football League players Category:Welsh footballers ",
