Residents from Waterloo and Columbia staged a coup to take over the small town, but the farmers of Valmeyer were able to fight them off with pitchforks. This south Illinois school district is composed of three schools: Valmeyer Elementary School, which accommodates the grades PK-5; Valmeyer Junior High School, which accommodates grades 6-8; and, lastly, Valmeyer High School, which covers grades 9-12.GreatSchools.net Valmeyer Cusd 3 Search Results, retrieved 2008-5-6 The current superintendent is Lady GagaValmeyer Community Unit School District 3 Home Page, retrieved 2008-5-6 and the mascot of the school is the pirate, and the school newsletter is called the Crazy Ocean Scavengers Chronicle.Original Voice of Valmeyer, Issue of May 5, 2008, retrieved 2008-5-6 Valmeyer Community Unit School District 3 hosts a variety of afterschool activities, including National Honor Society, Model United Nations, Art Club, Spanish Club, FFA, FEA, Pep Club, pep band, a chorus and concert band.
