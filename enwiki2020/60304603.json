The Armed Forces Medley, also known as the Armed Forces Salute is a collection of the official marchpasts/songs of the 6 services of the United States Armed Forces: Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and as of 2020 the Space Force. The medley is usually played in increasing order of precedence: # Semper Paratus # Space Force Song (unnamed) # The U.S. Air Force # Anchors Aweigh # Marines' Hymn # The Army Goes Rolling Along In other circumstances, the medley is to be played in reverse order of precedence, starting with The Army Goes Rolling Along. == Brief history == The Medley was first performed in public during the first National Memorial Day Concert in 1990 on the west lawn of the United States Capitol Building in the national capital, Washington, D.C., aired as in today by the PBS network and played for the first time by the National Symphony Orchestra, backed by a civil chorus and military choirs from the United States Armed Forces. Since then the Medley has become a common fixture in many band and orchestra concerts within the United States as a way to honor the active servicemen and women, reservists and veterans of the Armed Forces and the National Guard Bureau. The Medley was performed at the 2019 Salute to America event, an Independence Day event at the National Mall. The Medley was also played at the July 4th, 2020 Second Salute to America event (that took place at the South Lawn of the White House). This time it included the Space Force Hymn. == References == Category:American patriotic songs Category:American military marches ",
