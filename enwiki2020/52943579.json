Soon after the British Army was called in to restore order but events quickly shaped the conflict into a three-way urban guerrilla war with Loyalist paramilitaries like the Ulster Volunteer Force on one side, Irish Republican paramilitaries like the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on one side and the British state security services making up the other belligerent. The killings in Newry on 23 October 1971 was one in a series of controversial incidents between 1970\u20131973 that involved the British Army shooting and killing Catholic Irish Nationalist civilians. During the Falls Curfew of July 1970 the British Army killed four Catholic civilians, the next year in August 1971 (when internment was being introduced) during the Ballymurphy Massacre they shot dead eleven civilians including a Catholic priest and a 50-year-old mother of eight. The most famous of these incidents was Bloody Sunday in January 1972 in which British paratroopers shot dead 14 civil rights protesters, later on that same year British army snipers shot dead five civilians and injured two more Catholic civilians in an event known as the Springhill massacre. ==The shooting== The shooting happened when the undercover British soldiers who were in an observation post on the roof of a Woolworths store believed they saw a robbery taking place at a bank across the street and assumed the robbers were members of the IRA. Sean Ruddy (19), Robert Anderson (25) and Thomas McLoughlin (27) were all shot dead. The British Army said that it had received information that the Provisional IRA was going to launch an operation in the area. None of those killed were members of any paramilitary group and local eyewitnesses claim that the men were just having an argument with someone inside the bank, not robbing it, and that the army simply shot the three men without the men posing any serious risk to the soldiers or anybody else in the area. The shootings were carried out by the British Army\u2019s Royal Green Jackets. In 2011 the Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team (HET) released its four-year investigation into the shooting. The HET report concluded that the killings were \"a tragedy that should not have happened\". The report found there to be a \"question mark\" over the British Army's conduct. Arthur Ruddy, brother of Sean Ruddy and a former nationalist councillor, said the four-year-long investigation by the Historical Enquiries Team had vindicated the family, who always maintained the 19-year-old's killing was unlawful. There was intense rioting by the nationalist community in Newry for several days after the killing of the three men, with people directing their anger towards soldiers by throwing stones and, in some cases, petrol bombs at them. During the funerals of the men killed, most shops in the town closed out of respect to the dead men - except for the bank where the men had been shot, and the local post office. Both of these had their windows broken by youths throwing stones through them. After this there were further clashes with locals and the army, with the army firing CS gas and baton rounds at the mourners.The Troubles 7, by Joe Baker - issuuEamon Collins (1997) - Killing Rage pp, 44-45 == See also == *Bloody Sunday, 1972 *Falls Curfew *List of massacres in Ireland *Operation Demetrius *Springhill massacre ==References== Category:1971 murders in the United Kingdom Category:Conflicts in 1971 Category:1971 in Northern Ireland Category:Newry Category:Massacres in Northern Ireland Category:Massacres committed by the United Kingdom Category:British Army in Operation Banner Category:Military scandals Category:Mass murder in 1971 Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:Military actions and engagements during the Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1971 Category:The Troubles in Belfast Category:Terrorism deaths in Northern Ireland Category:October 1971 events in the United Kingdom Category:Terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland Category:Terrorism committed by the United Kingdom Category:People killed by security forces during The Troubles (Northern Ireland) ",
