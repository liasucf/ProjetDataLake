Its territory is now divided between Hungary and Slovakia. ==Geography== Around 1910, Aba\u00faj-Torna county shared borders with the counties G\u00f6m\u00f6r-Kishont, Szepes, S\u00e1ros, Zempl\u00e9n, and Borsod. The rivers Hern\u00e1d and B\u00f3dva flowed through the county. Its area was 3317 km\u00b2 around 1910. ==History== The county Aba\u00faj-Torna was a combination of the counties Aba\u00faj and Torna, officially joined in 1881. In the aftermath of World War I, the northern part of Aba\u00faj-Torna county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia (as Abovskoturnianska \u017eupa), as recognized by the concerned states in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. It continued to exist as an administrative unit until 1922. The southern half stayed in Hungary as the county Aba\u00faj-Torna, with capital Sziksz\u00f3. Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, most of the Czechoslovak part was returned to Hungary in November 1938. It was added to the county of Aba\u00faj-Torna, with capital Kassa (present-day Ko\u0161ice). After World War II, the Trianon border was restored, the county was renamed to Aba\u00faj County again. In 1950, it merged with the county of Borsod-G\u00f6m\u00f6r and the Hungarian part of Zempl\u00e9n to form the present Borsod- Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n county. Since 1993, when Czechoslovakia was split, the northern part of the county's former territory is part of Slovakia's Ko\u0161ice Region. ==Demographics== Aerial Photo: F\u00fcz\u00e9r \u2013 Castle In 1900, the county had a population of 196,462 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities: Total: * Hungarian: 140,050 (71.3%) * Slovak: 45,072 (22.9%) * German: 8,734 (4.5%) * Ruthenian: 519 (0.3%) * Croatian: 74 (0.0%) * Romanian: 60 (0.0%) * Serbian: 13 (0.0%) * Other or unknown: 1,940 (1.0%) According to the census of 1900, the county was composed of the following religious communities: Total: * Roman Catholic: 113,447 (57.7%) * Calvinist: 41,562 (21.2%) * Greek Catholic: 20,142 (10.3%) * Jewish: 14,069 (7.2%) * Lutheran: 7,101 (3.6%) * Greek Orthodox: 106 (0.0%) * Unitarian: 18 (0.0%) * Other or unknown: 17 (0.0%) Ethnic map of the county with data of the 1910 census (see the key in the description).In 1910, the county had a population of 202,288 people and was composed of the following linguistic communities: Total: * Hungarian: 156,668 (77.5%) * Slovak: 36,067 (17.8%) * German: 6,520 (3.2%) * Ruthenian: 378 (0.2%) * Romanian: 127 (0.0%) * Croatian: 63 (0.0%) * Serbian: 21 (0.0%) * Other or unknown: 2,444 (1.2%) According to the census of 1910, the county was composed of the following religious communities: Total: * Roman Catholic: 118,179 (58.4%) * Calvinist: 42,728 (21.1%) * Greek Catholic: 20,089 (9.9%) * Jewish: 14,251 (7.1%) * Lutheran: 6,832 (3.4%) * Greek Orthodox: 161 (0.0%) * Unitarian: 24 (0.0%) * Other or unknown: 24 (0.0%) In 1941: 203,438 Hungarians, 18,879 Slovaks, 2581 Bunjevacs, 904 Germans, 623 Roma, 256 Ruthenians, 72 Romanians, 3 Croatians, 105 other; 140,377 Roman Catholics, 45,384 Protestants, 22,476 Greek Catholics, 14,764 Jewish, 4773 Evangelicals, 339 Greek Orthodox, 116 Baptists and 55 Unitarians. ==Subdivisions== 300px In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Aba\u00faj-Torna were: {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2|Districts (j\u00e1r\u00e1s) |- !
