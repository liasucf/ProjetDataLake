If tied on points, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: #Number of points obtained in games between the teams concerned; #Goal difference in games between the teams concerned; #Goals scored in games between the teams concerned; #If, after applying criteria 1 to 3 to several teams, two teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the two teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 7 apply; #Goal difference in all games; #Goals scored in all games; #Drawing of lots. All times are local, WAT (UTC+1). ===Group A=== \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== \\---- \\---- ==Knockout stage== In the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time is played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner, except for the third place match where no extra time is played. ===Bracket=== ===Semi-finals=== \\---- ===Third place play-off=== ===Final=== ==Goalscorers== ;6 goals * Asisat Oshoala ;3 goals * Elizabeth Addo * Desire Oparanozie ;2 goals * Henriette Akaba * Linda Eshun * Samira Suleman * Bassira Tour\u00e9 ;1 goal * Raissa Feudjio * Christine Manie * Genevieve Ngo * Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 * Salma Tarik * Portia Boakye * Esse Akida * Cheris Salano * Sebe Coulibaly * Binta Diarra * Faith Ikidi * Ngozi Okobi * Francisca Ordega * Uchechi Sunday * Refiloe Jane * Andisiwe Mgcoyi * Linda Motlhalo * Jermaine Seoposenwe * Nothando Vilakazi ==Awards== The following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Award !Winner |- |Best player | Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 |- |Top scorer | Asisat Oshoala |- |Fair Play award | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Best XI |- !Position !Players |- |Goalkeeper | Annette Ngo Ndom |- |Defenders | |- |Midfielders | |- |Forwards | |- |Substitutes | |} ==Gallery== File:PrestationCoupe2.jpg File:PrestationCoupe1.jpg File:PrestationCoupe.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine20.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine5.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine7.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine17.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine27.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine13.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine38.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine25.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine40.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine26.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine34.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine4.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine6.jpg File:InstrumentsMusique1.jpg|Musical instruments File:InstrumentsMusique.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine18.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine29.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine39.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine19.jpg File:GroupeDanseCanFeminine37.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique21.jpg|Opening Ceremony in Yaounde, Cameroon File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique9.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique1.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique19.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique3.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique16.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique8.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique12.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique13.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique6.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique11.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique20.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique7.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique4.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique5.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique14.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique15.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique18.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique17.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique22.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique10.jpg File:OuvertureCoupeAfrique2.jpg ==References== ==External links== * *Women\u2019s Africa Cup Of Nations, Cameroon 2016, CAFonline.com 2016 Women Cup of Nations Category:2016 in women's association football Category:2016 in Cameroonian football Category:International association football competitions hosted by Cameroon Category:November 2016 sports events in Africa Category:December 2016 sports events in Africa ",
