Souques studied medicine in Paris, where in 1886 he became an interne and in 1891 earned his medical doctorate. Afterwards he worked as m\u00e9decin des h\u00f4pitaux (Hospice de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re), and in 1918 became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie de M\u00e9decine. With Joseph Babinski (1857-1932) and others, he was a founding member of the Societ\u00e9 de Neurologie de Paris. He is remembered for his extensive research of Parkinsonism, and in a 1921 treatise titled Rapport sur les syndromes parkinsoniens, he documented the importance of encephalitis lethargica as a cause of Parkinsonism. With his mentor Jean- Martin Charcot (1825-1893), he described the eponymous \"Souques-Charcot geroderma\", a condition that is a variant of Hutchinson\u2013Gilford disease. Souques is also credited with introducing the term \"camptocormia\" to describe an abnormal forward-flexed posture. == Associated eponym == * Souques' sign: Involuntary extension and spreading of the fingers when the paretic arm of patient is raised and extended. == Publications == * Infantilism hypophysaire, with St\u00e9phen Chauvet (1885-1950).
