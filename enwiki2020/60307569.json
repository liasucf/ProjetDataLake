He gained his medical qualifications in 1832 and sailed for South Australia aboard Rapid, one of the \"First Fleet of South Australia\", as surgeon to the survey party brought out by Colonel Light, arriving in August, 1836. He continued to practice after the survey party dissolved, with his surgery on Hindley Street \"opposite the old Blenheim Hotel\". He succeeded to the post of City Coroner with the death of George Stevenson JP (c. 1799 \u2013 19 October 1856). He remained Light's personal physician, and with Dr. Edward Wright attended him in his final illness, and was one of his pallbearers. He was in 1844 one of the founding members of the Medical Board of South Australia, and from 1849 to 1852 a medical officer at the Adelaide Hospital, resigning to concentrate on his private practice. A vast repository of information. In 1847 he was one of the 65 proprietors of what became St Peter's College. At least two of his sons, however, were students at J. L.
