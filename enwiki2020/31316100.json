    "text": "{| |} The Blackburn H.S.T.10 (sometimes known as the Blackburn B-9) was a 1930s British twin-engined commercial monoplane, designed and built by Blackburn Aircraft at Brough, East Yorkshire. ==Design and development== The H.S.T.10 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by two Napier Rapier VI engines. It had a retractable conventional landing gear with an enclosed cabin for two pilots and twelve passengers. It was fitted with a single-spar all- metal wing, known as the Duncanson wing, that had previously been tested on a Blackburn Segrave. The prototype used test serial B-9. In 1937, the project was abandoned, and B-9 was given to Loughborough College as an instructional airframe. ==Specifications== ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * H.S.T.10 Category:1930s British airliners Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Twin piston-engined tractor aircraft ",
