A shipbuilder by profession, he joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) in 1921 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) shortly afterwards. He moved to Hamburg in 1928 and was active in the Red Sport International. In 1934 he was arrested and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. After his release, Bohne organized a group of communist athletes from 1939 and joined the B\u00e4stlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group, an anti-Nazi resistance group, in 1941. He was arrested and imprisoned again in 1942, but managed to escape after the bombing of Hamburg in July 1943. On 5 January 1944, three Gestapo officers tried to arrest Bohne in Hamburg; when trying to defend himself, he was shot to death. ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Burg bei Magdeburg Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Deaths by firearm in Germany Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany ",
