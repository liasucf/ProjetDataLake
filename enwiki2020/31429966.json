The winners of the Group C tournament in Tarnby, Denmark will move on to the Group B tournament. The top seven women's teams at the 2011 European Curling Championships, Scotland, Russia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, will join defending champions Sweden in representing their respective nations at the 2012 Ford World Women's Curling Championship in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. The Czech Republic won the World Challenge Games over Group B winners Hungary to claim the last berth to the worlds. In the Group A competitions, Sweden emerged from the round robin undefeated, with Denmark and Scotland trailing with one and two losses, respectively. Russia defeated Germany in the tiebreaker to qualify for the playoffs. The page playoffs saw defending champions Sweden trounce Denmark in eight ends and Scotland edge past Russia in an extra end. Scotland crushed Denmark in the semifinal in eight ends with a score of 10\u20132, and Denmark dropped to the bronze medal game. Home team Russia, skipped by Anna Sidorova, wrapped up a respectable performance with a 13\u20137 win over Denmark's Lene Nielsen. The final saw Sweden's Margaretha Sigfridsson, a lead at last year's championships, faced Scotland's Eve Muirhead in a rematch of the 2010 European Curling Championships gold medal game. An error-prone Sweden allowed Scotland to steal points in four of the first five ends before scoring a single point in the sixth. After two ends where both teams traded singles, bringing the game up to 6\u20132, Sweden conceded and gave Scotland their second championship title, their first since Betty Law led Scotland to win the inaugural championships in 1975. The Group C competitions in T\u00e5rnby, Denmark saw Poland and Slovakia advance to the Group B competitions, after Slovakia defeated France in the semifinal. They joined eight other teams in Group B and played a round robin. In the page playoffs, Hungary advanced straight to the final after defeating Finland in the 1 vs. 2 game, while Poland advanced to the semifinal against Finland after defeating Slovakia. Finland won the semifinal over Poland, sending Poland to the bronze medal game to face Slovakia again. In their third meeting in the week, Slovakia finally triumphed over Poland by stealing the last two ends, winning with a score of 7\u20136. Hungary defeated Finland in a low-points affair to win the Group B competitions. As a result, Hungary and Finland advanced to the 2012 Women's Group A competitions, replacing Latvia and Norway, and Ireland and Wales were relegated to the 2012 Women's Group C competitions. ==Group A== ===Teams=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=center !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| |- |Skip: Linda Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 Third: Kamila Mo\u0161ov\u00e1 Second: Lenka \u010cernovsk\u00e1 Lead: Katerina Urbanov\u00e1 Alternate: Pavla Prok\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1 |Skip: Lene Nielsen Third: Helle Simonsen Second: Jeanne Ellegaard Lead: Maria Poulsen Alternate: Mette de Neergaard |Skip: Andrea Sch\u00f6pp Third: Imogen Oona Lehmann Second: Corinna Scholz Lead: Stella Hei\u00df Alternate: Monika Wagner |Skip: Diana Gaspari Third: Giorgia Apollonio Second: Chiara Olivieri Lead: Claudia Alvera Alternate: Veronica Gerbi |Skip: Ineta Ma\u010da Third: El\u0113na K\u0101posti\u0146a Second: Rasa Lubarte Lead: Ieva Rudz\u012bte |- align=center !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"200\"| |- |Skip: Linn Githmark Third: Ingrid Michalsen Second: Kristin Skaslien Lead: Henriette L\u00f8var Alternate: Marte Bakk |Skip: Anna Sidorova Third: Liudmila Privivkova Second: Margarita Fomina Lead: Ekaterina Galkina Alternate: Nkeiruka Ezekh |Skip: Eve Muirhead Third: Anna Sloan Second: Vicki Adams Lead: Claire Hamilton Alternate: Kay Adams |Fourth: Maria Prytz Third: Christina Bertrup Second: Maria Wennerstr\u00f6m Skip: Margaretha Sigfridsson Alternate: Sabina Kraupp |Skip: Binia Feltscher Third: Marlene Albrecht Second: Franziska Kaufmann Lead: Christine Urech Alternate: Manuela Siegrist |} ===Round Robin Standings=== Final Round Robin Standings {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=2|Key |- | style=\"background:#ffffcc;
