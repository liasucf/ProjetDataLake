    "text": "Johannes Gaitanides (1909 in Dresden \u2013 1988 in Schondorf) was a German author and journalist. == Biography == Gaitanides was born as a son of a Greek father and a German mother. He studied in Munich German literature, history and literature. He finished his studies in 1936 with a dissertation (Dr. phil.). His activities during the Second World War are unclear and have differing accounts. He himself stated that he continued his work reporting and publishing for news stations and the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences,Johannes Gaitanides: Griechenland ohne S\u00e4ulen, neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, M\u00fcnchen 1978, S. 315. even that he had emigrated to Greece temporarily for political reasons. However, other accounts claim that he had cooperated during the war as a war correspondent for the government, and as a special Waffen-SS contact.Andrea Reiter: Die Exterritorialit\u00e4t des Denkens: Hans Sahl im Exil, 2007, S. 258, Fn. 151 (online). In his 1940 published work Neues Griechenland (\"New Greece\") Gaitanides wrote: \"[\u2026] in Greece there is no Jewish question, just as in Turkish times Jews held a significant position; their danger is further characterized by their low international status as second-class.\"Hans Gaitanides: Neues Griechenland. Stollberg, Berlin 1940. In the Soviet Occupation Zone, the book was put on the list of proscribed literature in 1946.Deutsche Verwaltung f\u00fcr Volksbildung in der sowjetischen Besatzungszone, Liste der auszusondernden Literatur. Zentralverlag, Berlin 1946. After World War II, Gaitanides henceforth called Johannes (instead of the common shorthand form Hans, that the author had used until then), began writing as a freelance journalist for several newspapers and as a political commentator for the Bavarian Radio and television. In the 1970s, he was a senior editor at Donaukurier in Ingolstadt, a newspaper of central Bavaria. His numerous publication on Greece, which he toured regularly through his life, were some of his most significant works. As the works of Jacques Lacarri\u00e8re for French- speaking audiences shaped the image of Greece, Gaitanides' works did the same for the German-speaking public and led to major tourism and interest. His book Greece without columns: representing the history of Greece in modern times, is regarded as a prominent work. His works have been translated into many languages (English, Dutch, etc.). 1964 Gaitanides was awarded the Theodor Wolff Prize, named after the Jewish journalist Theodor Wolff (1868\u20131943) who had to flee National Socialist Germany in 1933. Gaitanides died in 1988 in his hometown Schondorf am Ammersee. ==Quotes== \"Die griechische Mahlzeit ist nicht Selbstzweck, sie ist vielmehr Vorwand und Anlass und Initialz\u00fcndung der Geselligkeit, und sie gl\u00fcckt um so mehr, je gelungener der Anlass\". (\"The Greek meal is not an end in itself, rather it is a pretext and occasion and initial spark of sociability, which succeed more so, depending on the meal's success\").http://www.studentenkochbuch.net/zitate.html ==Works== ===Broadcasts on BR=== *\"Art and Criticism: Why not rent pictures?
