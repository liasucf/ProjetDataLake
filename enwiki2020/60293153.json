    "text": "In model checking, a field of computer science, Timed Propositional Temporal Logic (TPTL) is an extension of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in which variables are introduced to measure times between two events. For example, while LTL allows to state that each event p is eventually followed by an event q, TPTL furthermore allows to give a time limit for q to occur. == Syntax == The future fragment of TPTL is defined similarly to linear temporal logic, in which furthermore, clock variables can be introduced and compared to constants. Formally, given a set X of clocks, MTL is built up from: * a finite set of propositional variables AP, * the logical operators \u00ac and \u2228, and * the temporal modal operator U, * a clock comparison x\\sim c, with x\\in X, c a number and \\sim being a comparison operator such as <, \u2264, =, \u2265 or >. * a freeze quantification operator x.\\phi, for \\phi a TPTL formula with set of clocks X\\cup\\\\{x\\\\}. Furthermore, for I=(a,b) an interval, x\\in I is considered as an abbreviation for x>a\\land x; and similarly for every other kind of intervals. The logic TPTL+Past is built as the future fragment of TLS and also contains * the temporal modal operator S. Note that the next operator N is not considered to be a part of MTL syntax. It will instead be defined from other operators. A closed formula is a formula over an empty set of clocks. == Model == Let T\\subseteq\\mathbb R_+ it intuitively represents a set of time. Let \\gamma: T\\to \\mathcal P(AP) a function which associate to each moment t\\in T a set of propositions from AP. A model of a TPTL formula is such a function \\gamma. Usually, \\gamma is either a timed word or a signal. In those cases, T is either a discrete subset or an interval containing 0. == Semantic == Let T and \\gamma as above. Let X a set of clocks. Let u:X\\to\\mathbb R_{\\ge0} a clock valuation over X. We are now going to explain what it means that a TPTL formula \\phi holds at time t for a valuation u. This is denoted by \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi. Let \\phi and \\psi be two formulas over the set of clocks X, \\xi a formula over the set of clocks X\\cup\\\\{y\\\\}, x\\in X, l\\in\\mathtt{AP}, c a number and \\sim being a comparison operator such as <, \u2264, =, \u2265 or >: We first consider formulas whose main operator also belongs to LTL: * \\gamma,t, u\\models l holds if l\\in\\gamma(t), * \\gamma,t, u\\models eg\\phi holds if either \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi or \\gamma,t, u\\models\\psi * \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi\\lor\\psi holds if either \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi or \\gamma,t, u\\models\\psi * \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi\\mathcal U\\psi holds if there exists t such that \\gamma,t, u\\models\\psi and such that for each t< t'< t, \\gamma,t', u\\models\\phi, * \\gamma,t, u\\models\\phi\\mathcal S\\psi holds if there exists t< t such that \\gamma,t, u\\models\\psi and such that for each t, \\gamma,t', u\\models\\phi, * \\gamma,t, u\\models y.\\xi holds if \\gamma,t, u[y\\to t]\\models\\phi holds, * \\gamma,t, u\\models x\\sim c holds if t- u(y)\\sim c. == Metric temporal logic == Metric temporal logic is another extension of LTL which allow to measure time. Instead of adding variables, it adds an infinity of operators \\mathcal U_I and \\mathcal S_I for I an interval of non-negative number. The semantic of the formula \\phi\\mathcal U_I\\psi at some time t is essentially the same than the semantic of the formula \\phi\\mathcal U\\psi, with the constraints that the time t at which \\psi must hold occurs in the interval t+I. TPTL is as least as expressive as MTL. Indeed, the MTL formula \\phi\\mathcal U_I\\psi is equivalent to the TPTL formula x.\\phi\\mathcal(x\\in I\\land\\psi) where x is a new variable. It follows that any other operator introduced in the page MTL, such as \\Box and \\Diamond can also be defined as TPTL formulas. TPTL is strictly more expressive than MTL both over timed words and over signals. Over timed words, no MTL formula is equivalent to \\Box(a\\implies x.\\Diamond(b\\land\\Diamond(c\\land x\\le 5))). Over signal, there are no MTL formula equivalent to x.\\Diamond(a\\land x\\le 1\\land\\Box(x\\le 1\\implies eg b)), which states that the last atomic proposition before time point 1 is an a. == Comparison with LTL == A standard (untimed) infinite word w=a_0,a_1,\\dots, is a function from \\mathbb N to A. We can consider such a word using the set of time T=\\mathbb N, and the function \\gamma(i)=a_i. In this case, for \\phi an arbitrary LTL formula, w,i\\models\\phi if and only if \\gamma,i, u\\models\\phi, where \\phi is considered as a TPTL formula with non-strict operator, and u is the only function defined on the empty set. ==References== Category:Temporal logic Category:Model checking ",
