A ruckman, Hein did not always play in his preferred position due to the presence of Mark Mickan in 1987 and spent a lot of time up forward during his eight appearances that season. He played seven further games in 1988, some of them as first ruckman. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:Brisbane Bears players Category:Norwood Football Club players Category:Living people ",
