    "text": "The republican movement refers to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and other political, social and paramilitary organisations and movements associated with it. It can refer to: *Republican Movement, which consisted of the Irish Republican Army and Sinn F\u00e9in prior to 1969. *Provisional Republican Movement or simply Republican Movement, which consisted of the Provisional IRA, Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in and other associated organisations.'No Irish model for Palestinians', Henry McDonald, The Guardian, 26 January 2006 *Official Republican Movement, which consisted of the Official IRA, Official Sinn F\u00e9in and other associated organisations. *Irish Republican Socialist Movement, which consists of the Irish National Liberation Army and the Irish Republican Socialist Party. *Dissident Republican Movement, which includes the Continuity IRA, Republican Sinn F\u00e9in, the Real IRA and 32 County Sovereignty Movement. The Dissident Republican Movement itself consists of multiple movements: *Continuity Republican Movement, which consists of the Continuity IRA and Republican Sinn F\u00e9in. *Real Republican Movement, which consisted of the Real IRA and 32 County Sovereignty Movement. == Usage == The term was in use at least as early as 1957 when the IRA issued a statement denying responsibility for the theft of explosives: :\"[t]he Republican Movement regards activities of this nature as definite acts of sabotage against the campaign now in progress in the 6 Counties against British occupation.\" J. Bowyer Bell, in The Secret Army, uses the term throughout to refer to the several organizations associated with the IRA in the 1960s and beyond. For instance, in chapter XVII he says: \"But beneath the smooth patina applied by MacGiolla, The Republican movement seethed with bitter faction and the advanced rot of despair.\" Specifically mentioned in relation to this are Sinn F\u00e9in, the Clan (Clan na Gael) in America, the United Irishman and the National Graves Association. Martin Dillon writes the term includes the IRA, Sinn F\u00e9in, Na Fianna \u00c9ireann, and Cumann na mBan. Dillon and Peter Taylor state the term is used by members of the IRA to avoid making an incriminating statement, since membership of the IRA is illegal. A Sinn F\u00e9in 'members course' of around 1979 states: \"Sinn F\u00e9in is the political section of the Republican Movement\". Robert White states in the early 1980s Sinn Fein was the junior partner in the relationship with the IRA, and they were separate organisations despite there being some overlapping membership. == See also == * Irish republicanism * Irish Republican Army (disambiguation) == References == Category:Irish republicanism ",
