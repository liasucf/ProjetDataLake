    "text": "Aristotle the Dialectician (or Aristoteles of Argos, ; fl. 3rd century BC), was an ancient Greek dialectic philosopher from Argos. In 252 BC, together with the historian Deinias of Argos, he contrived a plot to overthrow the tyranny in Sicyon. They successfully killed the tyrant Abantidas, but their further plans were thwarted by the tyrant's father Paseas who took control of the city. Deinias managed to escape to Argos, but Aristotle's fate is uncertain.Plutarch, Aratus, 3 In 224 a friend of Aratus of Sicyon named Aristotle belonged to the party at Argos which revolted against Cleomenes III of Sparta, leading the city back into the Achaean League. Although it cannot be excluded that this was the same person, it appears more probable that this Aristotle was a son or a relative of the dialectician.Polybius, II 53; Plutarch, Aratus, 44, Cleomenes, 20. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:3rd- century BC Greek people Category:Ancient Argives Category:Hellenistic-era philosophers Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
