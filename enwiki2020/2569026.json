The village is still generally rural and agrarian. Nods is first mentioned in 1255 as Nos. The municipality was formerly known by its German name Nos, however, that name is no longer used. The noble de Nods family first appears in the historical record in the 13th century and vanishes again in the 15th century. The village was located along the border between several competing powers. During the 13th century it was owned by the Counts of Neuch\u00e2tel, then by the city of Bern and then by the Bishop of Basel. It then remained under the authority of the Prince-Bishop for centuries. During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, preachers of the new faith came to convert Nods. However, they encountered serious resistance from the villagers. The village was finally converted after Bern forced the villagers to adopt the new faith. Those families that wished to remain Catholic were forced to move to Le Landeron and Cressier in Neuch\u00e2tel. Both before and after the Reformation, Nods was part of the parish of Diesse, until 1708 when it became an independent parish. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, nods became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, it was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Initially part of the District of Erlach, in 1846 it transferred to the La Neuveville District. The village church was built in 1639. The current building was built on the same site in 1835. The village economy was traditionally based on agriculture, animal husbandry and cheese production. Beginning in 1963 a chair lift to the Chasseral peak provided a small tourism industry until it closed in 1993. In the 1970s a small machine shop provided about ten industrial jobs in the village. The new development of Bois-Ch\u00e2tel was built in the 1980s. ==Geography== Nods village with the Chasseral peak in the background Nods has an area of . , a total of or 45.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 51.6% is forested.
