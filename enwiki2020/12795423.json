    "text": "A depiction of wave shoaling This article lists notable tsunamis, which are sorted by the date and location that the tsunami occurred. Because of seismic and volcanic activity associated with tectonic plate boundaries along the Pacific Ring of Fire, tsunamis occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a worldwide natural phenomenon. They are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides and glacier calving. Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events. Around 1600 BC, a tsunami caused by the eruption of Thira devastated the Minoan civilization on Crete and related cultures in the Cyclades, as well as in areas on the Greek mainland facing the eruption, such as the Argolid. The oldest recorded tsunami occurred in 479 BC. It destroyed a Persian army that was attacking the town of Potidaea in Greece.Smid, T. C.: \"'Tsunamis' in Greek Literature\", Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., Vol. 17, No. 1 (April 1970), pp. 100\u201304 (102f.) As early as 426 BC, the Greek historian Thucydides inquired in his book History of the Peloponnesian War (3.89.1\u20136) about the causes of tsunamis. He argued that such events could only be explained as a consequence of ocean earthquakes, and could see no other possible causes.Thucydides: \"A History of the Peloponnesian War\", 3.89.1\u20135 ==Prehistoric== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5em;\"| Date !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Location !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Main Article !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Primary Cause !!

Many fled to the waterfront, an area safe from fires and debris during aftershocks. These people observed the sea receding, revealing a sea floor littered with lost cargo and shipwrecks. The tsunami then struck with a maximum height of , traveling far inland. The earthquake, tsunami, and fires killed 40,000 to 50,000 people. Historical records of early navigators such as Vasco da Gama were lost, and among the buildings destroyed were most examples of Portugal's Manueline architecture. Europeans of the 18th century struggled to understand the disaster within religious and rational belief systems, and philosophers of the Enlightenment, notably Voltaire, wrote about the event. The philosophical concept of the sublime, as described by Immanuel Kant took inspiration from attempts to comprehend the enormity of the Lisbon quake and tsunami. The tsunami took just over 4 hours to travel over to Cornwall in the United Kingdom.

Toward the end of 1791 a series of earthquakes on the west flank of Mount Unzen moved towards Fugen-dake, one of Mount Unzen's peaks. In February 1792, Fugen-dake erupted, initiating two-months of lava flows. Earthquakes continued, shifting nearer to the city of Shimabara. On the night of 21 May, two large earthquakes preceded a collapse of the east flank of Mount Unzen's Mayuyama dome. An avalanche swept through Shimabara and into Ariake Bay, triggering a tsunami. The tsunami struck Higo Province (Kumamoto Prefecture) across Ariake Bay before bouncing back. Out of an estimated 15,000 fatalities, ~5,000 are thought to have been killed by the landslide, ~5,000 by the tsunami in Higo Province, and ~5,000 by the tsunami returning to Shimabara. The waves reached a height of , making this a small megatsunami. |- | 1797 || Sumatra, Indonesia || 1797 Sumatra earthquake || Earthquake || On 10 February 1797, a massive earthquake estimated to have been approximately 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, struck Sumatra in Indonesia.

In Atami, waves reaching 12 meters were recorded. Examples of tsunami damage include about 100 people killed along Yuigahama beach in Kamakura and an estimated 50 people on the Enoshima causeway. However, tsunamis only accounted for a small proportion of the final death toll of over 100,000, most of whom were killed in fire. |- | 1929 || Newfoundland || 1929 Grand Banks earthquake || Earthquake || On 18 November 1929, an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 occurred beneath the Laurentian Slope on the Grand Banks. The quake was felt throughout the Atlantic Provinces of Canada and as far away as Ottawa and Claymont, Delaware. The resulting tsunami measured over 7 meters in height and took about 2 hours to reach the Burin Peninsula on the south coast of Newfoundland, where 28 people lost their lives in various communities. It also snapped telegraph cables laid under the Atlantic. |- | 1932 || Mexico || 1932 Jalisco earthquakes || Earthquake || Three very large-to-great shocks off the coast of Jalisco in June 1932 each generated tsunamis. The last and smallest event in the series occurred updip relative to the mainshock and generated the largest tsunami. |- | 1933 || Sanriku, Japan || 1933 Sanriku earthquake || Earthquake || On 3 March 1933, the Sanriku coast of northeastern Honshu, Japan, which suffered a devastating tsunami in 1896 (see above), was again struck by tsunami waves resulting from an offshore magnitude 8.1 earthquake. The quake destroyed ~5,000 homes and killed 3,068 people, the vast majority as a result of tsunami waves. Especially hard hit was the coastal village of Tar\u014d (now part of Miyako city) in Iwate Prefecture, which lost 42% of its total population and 98% of its buildings. Tar\u014d is now protected by a tsunami wall, currently 10 meters in height and over 2 kilometers long. |- | 1934 || Tafjorden, Norway || Tafjorden || Rockslide || On 7 April 1934, a rockslide of about of rock fell off the mountain Langhamaren from a height of about . The rock landed in the Tafjorden which created a local tsunami which killed 40 peopleFurseth, Astor (1985): Dommedagsfjellet. Tafjord 1934. Oslo: Gyldendal. living on the shore of the fjord. The waves reached a height of near the landslide, about at Sylte, and about at Tafjord. It was one of the worst natural disasters in Norway in the 20th century. |- | 1936 || Loenvatnet, Norway || || Rockfall || On 13 September, approximately one million cubic metres of mountainside dislodged from the Mt. Ramnefjell at a height of 800 metres and landed in lake Loenvatnet in Sogn og Fjordane, creating a flood wave that destroyed several farms, killing 74 people. The second such incident in 31 years, the disaster caused the permanent depopulation of the area. |- | 1936 || Lituya Bay, Alaska || || Unknown || On 27 October, a megatsunami occurred in Lituya Bay in Alaska with a maximum run-up height of in Crillon Inlet at the head of the bay. The four eyewitnesses to the wave in Lituya Bay itself all survived and described it as between high as it traveled down the bay. The maximum inundation distance was inland along the north shore of the bay. The cause of the megatsunami remains unclear, but may have been a submarine landslide.Lander, pp. 61\u201364. |- | 1944 || T\u014dnankai, Japan || 1944 T\u014dnankai earthquake || Earthquake || A magnitude 8.0 earthquake on 7 December 1944, about 20 km off the Shima Peninsula in Japan, which struck the Pacific coast of central Japan, mainly Mie, Aichi, and Shizuoka Prefectures. News of the event was downplayed by the authorities in order to protect wartime morale, and as a result the full extent of the damage is not known, but the quake is estimated to have killed 1223 people, the tsunami being the leading cause of the fatalities. |- | 1945 || Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean || 1945 Balochistan earthquake || Earthquake || The earthquake with moment magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, occurred in British India at 5:26 PST on 28 November 1945. It resulted from a fault rupture near the Makran Trench. The resulting tsunami caused damage along the Makran coastal region affecting Pakistan, Iran, Oman and India. |- | 1946 || Nankai, Japan || 1946 Nankai earthquake || Earthquake || The Nankai earthquake on 21 December 1946 had a magnitude of 8.4 and occurred at 04:19 (local time) to the southwest of Japan in the Nankai Trough. This event was one of the Nankai megathrust earthquakes, periodic earthquakes observed off the southern coast of Kii Peninsula and Shikoku, Japan every 100 to 150 years. The subsequent tsunami washed away 1451 houses and caused 1500 deaths in Japan, and was observed on tide gauges in California, Hawaii, and Peru. Particularly hard hit were the coastal towns of Kushimoto and Kainan on the Kii Peninsula. The quake led to more than 1400 deaths, tsunami being the leading cause. |- | 1946 || Aleutian Islands || 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake || Earthquake || Residents running from an approaching tsunami in Hilo, Hawaii On 1 April 1946, the Aleutian Islands tsunami killed 159 people on Hawaii and five in Alaska (the lighthouse keepers at the Scotch Cap Light in the Aleutians). The wave reached Kauai, Hawaii 4.5 hours after the quake, and Hilo, Hawaii 4.9 hours later. The residents of these islands were caught completely off-guard by the onset of the tsunami due to the inability to transmit any warnings from the destroyed posts at Scotch Cap Light on Unimak Island in Alaska. The tsunami is known as the April Fools Day Tsunami in Hawaii because it happened on 1 April and many people thought it to be an April Fool's Day prank. It resulted in the creation of a tsunami warning system known as the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), established in 1949 for Oceania countries. |} ==1950\u20132000== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5em;\"| Date !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Location !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Main Article !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Primary Cause !!

The impact in the waters of Gilbert Inlet generated a local tsunami that crashed against the southwest shoreline and swept over the spur separating Gilbert Inlet from the main Lituya Bay. The wave continued down Lituya Bay, over La Chaussee Spit and into the Gulf of Alaska. The force of the wave removed all trees and vegetation from as high as 1720 feet (524 meters) above sea level. This is the highest wave ever recorded. The scale of this wave was so much greater than ordinary tsunamis, it eventually led to the new category of megatsunamis. |- | 1960 || Valdivia, Chile, and Pacific Ocean || 1960 Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean earthquake || Earthquake || The magnitude-9.5 earthquake of 22 May 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded, generated one of the most destructive tsunamis of the 20th century. The tsunami spread across the Pacific Ocean, with waves measuring up to 25 meters (82 feet) high in places. The first tsunami wave struck at Hilo, Hawaii, approximately 14.8 hrs after it originated. The highest wave at Hilo Bay was measured at ~10.7 m (35 ft). 61 lives were lost, allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. Almost 22 hours after the quake, waves up to 3 m above high tide hit the Sanriku coast of Japan, killing 142 people. Up to 6,000 people died in total worldwide due to the earthquake and tsunami. |- | 1963 || Vajont Dam, Monte Toc, Italy || Vajont Dam || Landslide || The Vajont Dam as seen from Longarone on 25 September 2012, showing the top 60\u201370 metres. The 200\u2013250-metre (656\u2013820-foot) megatsunami would have obscured virtually all of the sky in this picture. The Vajont Dam was completed in 1961 under Monte Toc, 100 km north of Venice, Italy. At 262 metres (860 feet), it was one of the highest dams in the world. On 9 October 1963 a landslide of about 260 million cubic meters of forest, earth, and rock, fell into the reservoir at up to 110 km per hour (68 mph). The resulting displacement of water caused 50 million cubic metres of water to overtop the dam in a 250-metre (820-foot) high megatsunami wave. The flooding destroyed the villages of Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova and Fa\u00e8, killing 1,450 people. Nearly 2,000 people perished in total. |- | 1964 || Niigata, Japan || 1964 Niigata earthquake || Earthquake || 28 people died, and entire apartment buildings were destroyed by liquefaction of the ground.

The resultant tsunami devastated more than 700 km of coastline bordering Moro Gulf in the North Celebes Sea. Estimated casualties included 5,000 dead, 2,200 missing, 9,500 injured, and 93,500 people left homeless. Affected cities include Cotabato, Pagadian, and Zamboanga, and the provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, Sulu, and Zamboanga del Sur. |- | 1979 || Tumaco, Colombia || 1979 Tumaco earthquake || Earthquake || A magnitude 8.1 earthquake occurred on 12 December 1979 at 7:59:4.3 UTC along the Pacific coast of Colombia and Ecuador. The earthquake and resulting tsunami destroyed at least six fishing villages and killed hundreds of people in the Colombian Department of Nari\u00f1o. The earthquake was felt in Bogot\u00e1, Cali, Popay\u00e1n, Buenaventura, Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, and Quito. The tsunami caused huge destruction in the city of Tumaco, as well as in the towns of El Charco, San Juan, Mosquera, and Salahonda on the Pacific coast of Colombia. Casualties included 259 dead, 798 wounded and 95 missing or presumed dead. |- | 1980 || Spirit Lake, Washington, U.S. || Spirit Lake (Washington), 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Mount St. Helens || Volcanic eruption || On 18 May 1980, in the course of a major eruption of Mount St. Helens, the upper 460 m (1400 ft) of the mountain failed, causing a major landslide. One lobe of the landslide surged onto the nearby Spirit Lake, creating a megatsunami 260 meters (853 feet) high. |- | 1983 || Sea of Japan || 1983 Sea of Japan earthquake || Earthquake || On 26 May 1983 at 11:59:57 local time, a magnitude-7.7 earthquake occurred in the Sea of Japan, about 100 km west of the coast of Noshiro in Akita Prefecture. Out of 107 fatalities, all but four were killed by the resulting tsunami, which struck communities along the coast, especially Aomori and Akita Prefectures and the Noto Peninsula. Footage of the tsunami hitting the fishing harbor of Wajima on Noto Peninsula was broadcast on TV. Waves exceeded 10 meters in some areas. Three of the fatalities were along the east coast of South Korea (whether North Korea was affected is not known). The tsunami also hit Okushiri Island. |- | 1992 || Nicaragua || 1992 Nicaragua earthquake || Earthquake || A 7.2+ quake hit offshore in Nicaragua, sending a devastating tsunami into the Rivas department coast, killing some 116 people.

Within minutes, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning that was broadcast on NHK in English and Japanese (archived at NHK library). However, at Okushiri, a small island near the epicenter, some waves reaching 30 meters struck within two to five minutes of the quake. Despite being surrounded by tsunami barriers, Aonae, a village on a low-lying peninsula, was struck over the following hour by 13 waves over two meters high arriving from multiple directions, including waves that bounced back off Hokkaido. Of 250 people killed as a result of the quake, 197 were victims of the tsunami that hit Okushiri; the waves also caused deaths on Hokkaido. While many residents, remembering the 1983 tsunami (see above), survived by evacuating on foot, many others underestimated how soon the waves would arrive (the 1983 tsunami took 17 minutes to hit Okushiri) and were killed as they attempted to evacuate by car. The highest wave of the tsunami was 31 meters (102 ft) high. |- | 1994 || Java earthquake || 1994 Java earthquake || Earthquake || Two hundred and fifty killed as a M7.8 earthquake and tsunami affected east Java and Bali on 3 June 1994. |- | 1998 || Papua New Guinea || 1998 Papua New Guinea earthquake || Earthquake || On 17 July 1998, a Papua New Guinea tsunami killed approximately 2,200 people. A 7.1-magnitude earthquake 24 km offshore was followed within 11 minutes by a tsunami about 15 metres tall. The tsunami was generated by an undersea landslide, which was triggered by the earthquake. The villages of Arop and Warapu were destroyed. |- | 1999 || Sea of Marmara || 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake || Earthquake || The earthquake triggered a tsunami in the Sea of Marmara, with a maximum water height of 2.52 m. 150 people were killed when the town of Degirmendere was flooded and a further five were swept into the sea at Ula\u015fl\u0131. |} ==2000s/2010s== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5em;\"| Date !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Location !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Main Article !! style=\"width:10em;\"| Primary Cause !!

The earthquake was the third largest earthquake in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of approximately , making it the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in recorded history. The tsunami killed people from the immediate vicinity of the quake in Indonesia, Thailand, and the north-west coast of Malaysia, to thousands of kilometres away in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and as far away as Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. This trans-Indian Ocean tsunami is an example of a teletsunami, which travels vast distances across the open ocean, and an ocean-wide tsunami. It became known as the \"Boxing Day Tsunami\" because it struck on Boxing Day (26 December). Unlike in the Pacific Ocean, there was no organized alert service covering the Indian Ocean. This was in part due to the absence of major tsunami events since 1883 (the Krakatoa eruption, see above). In light of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, UNESCO and other world bodies have called for an international tsunami monitoring system. |- | 2006 || South of Java Island || 2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami || Earthquake || A 7.7 magnitude earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean seabed on 17 July 2006, 200 km south of Pangandaran, a beach famous to surfers for its perfect waves. This earthquake triggered tsunamis with heights that varied from 2 meters at Cilacap to 6 meters at Cimerak beach, where it swept away and flattened buildings as far as 400 metres away from the coastline. More than 800 people were reported missing or dead. |- | 2006 || Kuril Islands || 2006 Kuril Islands earthquake || Earthquake || On 15 November 2006, a magnitude 8.3 earthquake occurred off the coast near the Kuril Islands. In spite of the quake's large 8.3 magnitude, a relatively small tsunami was generated. This tsunami was recorded or observed in Japan and at distant locations throughout the Pacific. |- | 2007 || Solomon Islands || 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake || Earthquake || On 2 April 2007, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck about south of Ghizo Island in the western Solomon Islands at 7:39 a.m., resulting in a tsunami that was up to 12 m (36 feet) high. The wave, which struck the coast of Solomon Islands (mainly Choiseul, Ghizo Island, Ranongga, and Simbo), triggered tsunami warnings and watches extending from Japan to New Zealand to Hawaii and eastern Australia. The tsunami killed 52 people and dozens were injured when waves inundated towns. A state of national emergency was declared for the Solomon Islands. On the island of Choiseul, a wall of water reported to be 9.1 m (30 feet) high swept almost 400 meters inland. The largest waves hit the northern tip of Simbo Island, where two villages, Tapurai and Riquru, were completely destroyed by a 12 m wave, killing 10 people. Officials estimate that the tsunami displaced more than 5000 residents throughout the archipelago. |- | 2007 || Chile || 2007 Ays\u00e9n Fjord earthquake || Earthquake and landslide || On 21 April 2007, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake occurred in the Ays\u00e9n Fjord. On the mountains around the fjord, the earthquake caused landslides that in turn created waves as high as six meters, which severely damaged some salmon aquaculture installations. The potable water systems of the cities of Puerto Chacabuco and Puerto Ais\u00e9n were broken, forcing firefighters and the army to supply water. The electricity network of Puerto Chacabuco was also cut off. Ten people were reported dead or missing. |- | 2007 || British Columbia || || Landslide || On 4 December 2007, a landslide entered Chehalis Lake in British Columbia, generating a large lake tsunami that destroyed campgrounds and vegetation many meters above the shoreline. |- | 2009 || Samoa || 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami || Earthquake || A submarine earthquake took place in the Samoan Islands region at 06:48:11 local time on 29 September 2009. This magnitude 8.1 quake on the outer rise of the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone was the largest earthquake of 2009. The subsequent tsunami caused substantial damage and loss of life in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center recorded a rise in sea levels near the epicenter, and New Zealand scientists noted waves as high as on the Samoan coast. More than 189 people were killed, especially children, mostly in Samoa. Large waves with no major damage were reported on Fiji, the northern coast of New Zealand and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. People on low-lying atolls of Tokelau moved to higher ground as a precaution. |- | 2010 || Chile || 2010 Chile earthquake || Earthquake || Destruction provoked by the 2010 Chile earthquake and tsunami, in Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region, Chile On 27 February 2010, an 8.8 earthquake offshore of Chile caused a tsunami which caused serious damage and loss of life, it also caused minor effects in other Pacific nations. |- | 2010 || Sumatra || 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami || Earthquake || On 25 October 2010, a 7.7 earthquake struck near South Pagai Island in Indonesia triggering a localized tsunami that killed at least 408 people. |- | 2011 || New Zealand || 2011 Christchurch earthquake || Earthquake-triggered ice fall || On 22 February 2011, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit the Canterbury region of the South Island, New Zealand.

Beginning at 350m over water height, it caused a tsunami 20\u201330 meters high across the caldera, and potentially larger at localized points of impact. Thanks to the late hour, no tourists were present; however, search and rescue observed a steam cloud rising from the volcano, apparently geothermal steam released by the landslide. Whether geothermal activity played a role in the landslide is uncertain. A total of 30\u201350 million cubic meters was involved in the landslide, raising the caldera's water level by 1\u20132 meters. |- | 2015 || Chile ||2015 Chile earthquake || Earthquake || On Wednesday, 16 September 2015, a major earthquake measuring 8.3 on the Moment Magnitude scale struck the west coast of Chile, causing a tsunami up to 16 feet (4.88 meters) high along the Chilean coast. |- | 2015 || Taan Fiord, Alaska, U.S. || Icy Bay (Alaska) || Landslide || On Saturday, 17 October 2015, a major landslide occurred at the head of Taan Fiord, a finger of Icy Bay.
