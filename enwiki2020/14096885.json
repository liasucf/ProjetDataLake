In 1910, he was elected into the National Academy of Design, an elite organization. He kept a studio in New York. In 1906 Groll made the first of several trips to the American Southwest at the suggestion of Professor Stewart Culin of the Brooklyn Museum. He mostly focused on oil paintings of the Native American lands, which were mostly realistic, however, encompassed some abstract shapes as well. He won several awards for his work in both Arizona and New York.Oxford Gallery ==References== ==External links== *Fully digitized 1911 exhibition catalog featuring Groll from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries. *Biographical Notes, a catalog of American artists containing additional information on Groll (page 22).
