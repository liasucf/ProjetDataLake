He left in April 1994 to join Wrexham having failed to make the first team at Carrow Road. He spent six years with Wrexham, playing in over 100 league games, and also playing in the European Cup Winners Cup and in an FA Cup quarter final. He won ten Under 21 caps for Wales and only missed a full cap through illness, having contracted pneumonia. He was released by Wrexham in May 2000 and early in the following season joined Llanelli. Later that season he moved to Carmarthen Town and during the 2001-02 season left to join Haverfordwest County. In June 2002 he was appointed player-manager of Haverfordwest, at the age of just 27 years, guiding them to a UEFA Cup spot in his second season in charge.
