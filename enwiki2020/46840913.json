    "text": "The Writer's Block is an independent bookseller, publisher, and literacy educator in downtown Las Vegas. The Writer's Block was established in 2014 by 826NYC co-founder Scott Seeley and Drew Cohen. It was opened with former BSSco. store manager and Archway Editions publisher Chris Molnar. It is the first independent bookstore in Las Vegas, and second in the state of Nevada. Behind the bookstore front at the original Fremont St. location was the literacy education component of the Writer's Block, known as Codex. Similar in layout to the educational area behind 826NYC's Superhero Supply Store, Codex also featured movable walls, tables and desks. It was used for free writing workshops for children ages 5-18, in addition to readings, signings, and ongoing series such as Neon Lit, the monthly reading by MFA and PHD writing students at UNLV. In 2019, the Writer's Block relocated to the Lucy, a new art center in downtown Las Vegas. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Independent bookstores of the United States Category:Downtown Las Vegas Category:Buildings and structures in Las Vegas Category:Retail buildings in Nevada Category:Creative writing programs Category:Education in Las Vegas Category:Bookstores established in the 21st century Category:American companies established in 2014 Category:Publishing companies established in 2014 Category:Retail companies established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Nevada Category:Tourist attractions in the Las Vegas Valley ",
