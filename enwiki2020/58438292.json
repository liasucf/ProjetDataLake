The municipality included the coastal and island areas around the entrance to the Folda fjord, plus the northern coast of the Mistfjorden to the south of the Folda fjord.

The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Kjerring\u00f8y where Kjerring\u00f8y Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Kjerring\u00f8y was established on 1 January 1906 when the old municipality of Nordfold-Kjerring\u00f8y was split into Kjerring\u00f8y (population: 857) and Nordfold (population: 1,485). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Kjerring\u00f8y ceased to exist. Most of Kjerring\u00f8y (population: 524) was incorporated into the municipality of Bodin, its neighbor to the south. The Brennsund district north of the Folda fjord (population: 30), was incorporated into Steigen Municipality. Prior to the merger Kjerring\u00f8y had a population of 574. Later, on 1 January 1968, Bodin (including most of Kjerring\u00f8y) was incorporated into the Bod\u00f8 Municipality. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Kjerring\u00f8y, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.
