In 1989, the district of Bayburt became a Province in its own right. ===Governor=== \u00c7akmako\u011flu spent three years serving as the Deputy Governor of Ankara before being appointed as the 28th Governor of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane from 1972 to 1975, as the 28th Governor of Isparta from 1975 to 1978, as the 27th Governor of Edirne from February to August 1978, as the 27th Governor of Gaziantep from 1979 to 1980 and finally as the 31st Governor of Mersin from 1984 to 1988. ===Undersecretary=== Between the years 1988 and 1992, \u00c7akmako\u011flu served in the General Directorate of Security, as the Undersecretary to the Prime Minister of Turkey and as the Undersecretary to the Minister of the Interior. In 1991, he was elected as a member of the Council of Higher Education (Y\u00d6K) from the Cabinet office contingency. In 1992, after retirement, he served as the chief advisor to the President of Turkey, at the time Turgut \u00d6zal. ===Minister of the Interior=== With the Constitution requiring that the serving partisan Ministers of the Interior, of Transport and of Justice should vacate their position to their respective Undersecretaries at least three months before a general election, \u00c7akmako\u011flu took over from Mustafa Kalemli as Minister of the Interior on 30 August 1991, three months before the 1991 general election. He remained as Minister until a new government was formed, being succeeded by \u0130smet Sezgin when the coalition government between the True Path Party and the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) on 21 November 1991. ==Political career== \u00c7akmako\u011flu first entered politics in 1992 by joining the Motherland Party (ANAP), but left the party to join the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in 1995. He served as an advisor to MHP leader Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f until his death in 1997. On 23 November 1997, \u00c7akmako\u011flu was elected to the MHP party council and later became a Deputy Leader of the MHP. He was elected to Parliament as an MHP MP from Kayseri in the 1999 general election. ===Minister of National Defense=== Following the 1999 general election, the Democratic Left Party (DSP), the Nationalist Movement Party and the Motherland Party formed a triple coalition government. \u00c7akmako\u011flu was subsequently appointed as the Minister of National Defense. He served in the position until 18 November 2002. He lost his seat in the 2002 general election due to the MHP falling below the 10% election threshold necessary to win parliamentary representation. ===Presidential candidacy=== The MHP managed to win parliamentary representation once again in the 2007 general election, with \u00c7akmako\u011flu again returning as an MP for Kayseri. He became a Deputy Leader of the MHP for a second time shortly after. The general election had been called early due to the parliamentary deadlock caused during the presidential election earlier that year. With the parliamentary process to elect a successor to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer resuming after the general election, the MHP put forward \u00c7akmako\u011flu as their presidential candidate. He won 70 votes in the first round, 71 in the second and 70 in the final round, losing to the Justice and Development Party candidate Abdullah G\u00fcl. \u00c7akmako\u011flu stepped down as an MP at the 2011 general election. ==Personal life== \u00c7akmako\u011flu is married with two children.
