Spain was just one of the many countries which resisted the expansion of the French Empire under Napoleon I. It is notable for the bravery of its general population who fought as Guerrillas, preventing the occupying French forces from obtaining supplies or safe passage. Further information == Line Infantry == The Spanish Line Infantry uniform changed several times during the Napoleonic wars. Both officially with the introduction of new model uniforms, the supply of British made uniforms, locally produced clothing and those captured as the spoils of war. The M1797 uniform was officially listed as being white with collars, cuffs and facings according in the regimental facing colours and distinguished by their pattern combination. Three regiments were recorded as still wearing this uniform as late as May 1808. The M1802 uniform was dark blue, with black facings piped red and red turn backs on the jacket. It was recorded as being issued with white trousers, and bicorns with red feathers or plumes. The main difference to separate regiments using this uniform was the buttons stamped with regimental symbols or numbers. Twelve regiments are recorded as still wearing this uniform in May 1808. The issue of the M1805 uniform restored the official uniform's jacket colour to white and brought back the coloured facing colours. These were used to distinguish between regiments, by a combination of cuffs, collars and facings in either facing colour piped white or white piped with the facing colour. Buttons were also used, either silver or brass. Turnbacks on the jackets were always the facing colour. === Uniforms Issued === ==== 1st Regiment, Rey ==== Issued with 1802 uniforms, which were still in use in May 1808, use possibly continued beyond this date.
