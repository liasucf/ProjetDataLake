It is responsible for sending Uganda's representative to the Miss Earth pageant which is an annual international beauty pageant promoting environmental awareness. Pearl Asasira was crowned as Miss Earth Uganda 2015. ==Overview== As published in their website, Miss Earth Uganda is a beauty pageant in search of the most beautiful young Ugandan lady who is very knowledgeable about her environment and who will strongly stand as an ambassador for the protection and preservation of the environment. During the Miss Earth Uganda launch, the pageant national director's Victoria Nabagereka said, \u201cCurrently, the environment is rapidly undergoing thorough degradation, encroaching on wetlands [and] forest reserves; through the pageant, we want to set standards for beauties who understand the environment.\u201d She added, \u201cWe are looking for a girl to be an ambassador for the nature and culture of Uganda. This is a good platform for the girls to get exposure and experience.\u201d The pageant is making efforts to create awareness about environmental sustainability and decided focus on activities that highly promote the protection and preservation of the environment such as greening, recycling, tree planting, energy efficiency, ecotourism and carbon conscious life style choices among others. Miss Earth Uganda works to combat the ill effects of global warming. ==History== ===2007-2008: Uganda's debut=== Uganda debuted in 2002 through the Miss Uganda pageant. While Uganda came back in 2007, the pageant's first runner up, Hellen Karungi, competed in Miss Earth 2007. Victoria Nabagereka participated the following year. Both went unplaced as the pageant concluded. After 2008, Uganda did not send a delegate to Miss Earth until 2015. ===2014-present: Uganda's comeback=== The Miss Earth Uganda franchise was obtained by First Face Pageantry and Modeling Consultancy Ltd. and a national contest will be held annually. Victoria Nabagereka, Miss Earth Uganda 2008, acts now as the national director for Uganda. Miss Earth Uganda is being partnered by National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and National Forestry Authority (NFA). ==Selection process== The organizers say they will start with 25 districts and since the pageant is district-based, they will closely work with local officials and council chairpersons, together with pageant delegates and MEU district delegates. \u201cAt district level, competitions will be carried out to ensure that each of the participating candidates are not only beautiful but also environmentally- informed,\u201d Nabagereka said. The evaluators will come from National Forestry Authority and National Environmental Management Authority (Nema). According to Gilbert Kadilo, the communications and PR manager at NFA, the authority will provide technical advice and guidance. \u201cThis is a springboard and we expect this to translate into skills and hearts that will love and protect the environment,\u201d he said. == Titleholders == This list includes all the representatives of Uganda, including the representatives sent by the previous license holders. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Miss Earth Uganda ! colspan=\"3\" width=\"60\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"| |- !width=\"200\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Air !width=\"200\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Water !width=\"200\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"| Fire |- | 2002 | Martha Semegura Nambajjwe | | | |- | colspan=\"5\" |- | 2007 | Hellen Karungi | | | |- | 2008 | Victoria Nabagereka | | | |- | colspan=\"5\" |- | 2015 | Sandra Akello | | | |- | 2016 | Priscilla Achieng | | | |- | 2017 | Josephine Mutesi | | | |} === Representative for Miss Earth === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font- size: 95%; text-align:center\" !width=\"60\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Year !width=\"200\" style=\"background- color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Miss Earth Uganda !width=\"200\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Hometown !width=\"200\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Placement !width=\"300\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Special Award(s) |-bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" | 2002 | Martha Semegura Nambajjwe | | Unplaced | None |- | colspan=\"5\" |-bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" | 2007 | Hellen Karungi | | Unplaced | None |-bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" | 2008 | Victoria Nabagereka | | Unplaced | None |- | colspan=\"5\" |-bgcolor=\"pink\" | 2015 | Sandra Akello | | Unplaced | National Costume (Africa) |-bgcolor=\"pink\" | 2016 | Priscilla Achieng | | Unplaced | National Costume (Africa) |-bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" | 2017 | Josephine Mutesi | | Unplaced | None |} ==References== ==Further reading== * NFA, NEMA organize Miss Earth Uganda 2015.
