    "text": "Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day) () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually according to the Jewish calendar on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan to commemorate the Jewish people entering the Land of Israel as written in the Hebrew Bible, which happened on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan (). The holiday was also established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim, Jewish immigrants, to Israeli society. Yom HaAliyah is also observed in Israeli schools on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan. The opening clause of the Yom HaAliyah Law states in Hebrew: English translation: ==History== Joshua Leading the Israelites Across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan, Benjamin West Yom HaAliyah, as a modern holiday celebration, began in 2009 as a grassroots community initiative and young Olim self-initiated movement in Tel Aviv, spearheaded by the TLV Internationals organization of the Am Yisrael Foundation. On June 21, 2016 the Twentieth Knesset voted in favor of codifying the grassroots initiative into law by officially adding Yom HaAliyah to the Israeli national calendar. The Yom HaAliyah bill was co-sponsored by Knesset members from different parties in a rare instance of cooperation across the political spectrum of the opposition and coalition. The key Knesset parliamentarians who initially worked on the final successful version of the Yom HaAliyah bill were Miki Zohar of Likud, Hilik Bar of Israeli Labor Party, and Michael Oren of Kulanu. There were previous failed attempts in other Knesset sessions to create similar legislation, none of which were related to the ultimate successful creation of the holiday, namely Knesset members Avraham Neguise, Yoel Razvozov, Robert Ilatov, and Yaakov Katz. https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Its-official-Aliya-Day-to-be-a- national-holiday-457390 http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Bill- seeks-to-establish-national-Aliya-Day-345758 ==Significance== The original calendar date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, the tenth of Nisan, is laden with symbolism. Although a modern holiday created by the Knesset of Israel, the tenth of Nisan is a date of religious significance for the Jewish People as recounted in the Hebrew Bible and in traditional Jewish thought.http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Bill-seeks-to-establish- national-Aliya-Day-345758 ===Biblical=== 5th Century mosaic depicting the Ark of the Covenant carried by the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan led by Joshua The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan by Italian Renaissance painter Raphael On the tenth of Nisan, according to the biblical narrative in the Book of Joshua, Joshua leading the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into the Promised Land while carrying the Ark of the Covenant. It was thus the first documented \"mass Aliyah.\" On that day, God commanded the Israelites to commemorate and celebrate the occasion by erecting twelve stones with the text of the Torah engraved upon them. The stones represented the entirety of the Jewish nation's twelve tribes and their gratitude for God's gift of the Land of Israel () to them. The 10th of Nisan is also significant as it was the first Shabbat HaGadol that took place five days before the Israelites left Egypt beginning The Exodus. This is also the date that Moses's sister Miriam died and according to the Biblical narrative her well that miraculously traveled with the Israelites through the desert dried up (Numbers 20:1\u20132). The tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan, which is the first month according to the ordering of the Hebrew calendar, is referenced in association with Aliyah multiple times within the Biblical text.

Besides the individual religious implication of those Torah laws that can only be followed in Israel as opposed to when Jews are living around the world, there are traditional precepts that uniquely effect the Jewish People as an entire nation after having made Aliyah.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/24504 When the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the Land of Israel for the first time on the 10th of Nisan, according to traditional Jewish teachings they took upon themselves a special dimension to the concept of \"arevut\" or \"mutual responsibility\". https://www.etzion.org.il/en/shiur-20arevutandtokhacha Arevut is known also by the Talmudic Hebrew/Aramaic maxim mentioned in Shevuot 39a, \"Kol Yisrael Areivim Zeh baZeh\", \"\u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d6\u05d4\", meaning \"All Jews are Responsible for One Another\". https://www.etzion.org.il/en/mutual- responsibility-jewish-state The Maharal of Prague, Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, comments on the Talmudic statement that the Israelites were not truly responsible for one another until after they had crossed the Jordan. http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2012/No.%203/The%20Torah%20of%20Israel.pdf Arevut implies an obligation on all Jews to ensure that other Jews have their spiritual and basic needs taken care of. Simply by virtue of being a Jew living in the Land of Israel, one has an elevated responsibility for the well- being of other Jews.https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/all-of-israel- are-responsible-for-one-another/ Jews are expected to be a \u201clight unto the nations\u201d, presenting a model of morality and brotherly responsibility. Specifically in terms of \"Kol Yisrael\", the hope is that other nations around the globe will also see how Jews help each other when living in Israel and will try to do the same for their own people. http://www.jewishvaluesonline.org/200 ===State of Israel=== Marc Chagall - Les Isra\u00e9lites Passent le Jourdain The Israelites crossing the Jordan River with the Ark, Old Sacristy, Milan Italy, 15th c. Aliyah (, ; , \"ascent\") is the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Land of Israel. Also defined as \"the act of going up\", \"making Aliyah\" by moving to the Land of Israel is one of the most basic tenets of Judaism and therefore Zionism. The State of Israel's Law of Return gives Jews and their descendants automatic rights regarding residency and Israeli citizenship. From the modern founding of the State of Israel, honoring Aliyah as a core value of the nation is evident even in the text of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, most profoundly in the opening few lines. Aliyah as a core value of the State of Israel can be seen in its national anthem, Hatikvah, \"The Hope\", which was adapted from a poem by the 19th century Jewish poet, Naftali Herz Imber. Honoring Aliyah has also been at the core of the State of Israel's religious sector. The Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel is a prayer said in many Jewish synagogues on Shabbat and on Jewish holidays, both in Israel and around the globe. The prayer requests divine providence for the State of Israel, its leaders, and that God helps with Aliyah, namely that still exiled Jewish People be gathered back into the Land of Israel. The prayer was instituted in 1948 by the Sephardic and Ashkenazic Chief Rabbis of the newly formed State of Israel, respectively Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog with assistance by Nobel laureate Shmuel Yosef Agnon. https://opensiddur.org/prayers/collective-welfare/government/medinat- yisrael/prayer-for-the-welfare-of-the-state-of-israel-by-yitshak-halevi- hertzog-1948/ ===Jewish thought=== James Jacques Joseph Tissot - The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan Aliyah is an important Jewish religious concept and a fundamental component of Zionism. For much of Jewish history, the majority of the Jewish People have lived in the diaspora where Aliyah was developed as a national aspiration for the Jewish People. It is enshrined in Israel's Law of Return, which accords any Jew (deemed as such by halakha and Israeli secular law) the legal right to assisted immigration and settlement in Israel, as well as Israeli citizenship. Someone who \"makes Aliyah\" is called an \"Oleh\" (m.; pl. \"Olim\") or \"Olah\" (f.; pl. \"Olot\"). Many religious Jews espouse Aliyah as a return to the Promised Land, and regard it as the fulfillment of God's biblical promise to the descendants of the Hebrew patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman, also known as Nachmanides or the Ramban, includes making Aliyah in his enumeration of the 613 commandments. The Hebrew Bible is laden with references to a future when the Jewish People would have a mass return to the Land of Israel. The Bible recounts that when God sent the Jews to exile from the Holy Land approximately 2,500 years ago, He made a promise about the future of Aliyah: God promised that one day, He would gather His children from the four corners of the earth, and bring them back home, to the Land of Israel: Robert Hecquet, Israelites Crossing the Jordan River In the Talmud, at the end of tractate Ketubot, the Mishnah says: The discussion on this passage in the Mishnah emphasizes the importance of living in Israel: Sifre says that the mitzvah (commandment) of living in Eretz Yisrael is as important as all the other mitzvot combined. There are many mitzvot such as shmita, the sabbatical year for farming, which can only be fulfilled in the Land of Israel. According to the traditional Jewish ordering of books of the Tanakh (Old Testament), the very last word of the last book in the original Hebrew (2 Chronicles 36:23) is veya\u2018al, a jussive verb form derived from the same root as \"Aliyah\", meaning \"and let him go up\" (to Jerusalem in the Land of Israel). As the tenth of Nisan occurs a few days before the Passover holiday, when Israeli schools are not in session, the school system will also honor Aliyah on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan. That date is also symbolic as the Torah portion read in synagogues that week, Lekh Lekha, relates the story of how the biblical patriarch Abraham is ordered by God to leave his home, his birthplace, and his family and go up to the Land of Israel. This is also the date that the additional prayer for rain is added into the Amidah, and recited three times a day by Jews in Israel. ===Modern=== Am Yisrael Foundation logo representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel having made Aliyah to the Land of Israel en masse from the now emptied out four corners of the world, signified as the twelve stalks of wheat dreamt by Joseph Jay M.

Although it was not a reoccurring holiday, the first instance of a modern public celebration honoring the idea of Aliyah Day and Jewish immigrants settling the Land of Israel was hosted by Keren HaYesod in Tel Aviv on the second of November 1950.
