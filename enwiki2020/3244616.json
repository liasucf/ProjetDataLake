He had 2,025 delegates and was certain to reach the 2,118 delegates required to win the Democratic nomination. By the time of the convention, Obama had 1766.5 elected pledged delegates and the votes of 463 superdelegates. Obama received the official Democratic presidential nomination from the Party's delegates at its 2008 National Convention in Denver, Colorado, held in August.

Biden first hinted that he might run in 2008 in a December 8, 2004, radio interview with host Don Imus, saying: \"I'm going to proceed as if I'm going to run.\" Biden had repeatedly stated his intention to run, and did so as early as March 21, 2006. Biden's Federal Leadership PAC is \"Unite Our States\", which tracks Biden's public appearances and policy positions. On January 7, 2007, when asked by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, \"Are you running for president?\" he responded, \"I am running for president.\" He also said he planned to create an exploratory committee by the end of the month. On January 31, 2007, he officially signed the papers with the FEC to run for president. He dropped out of the race on January 3, 2008 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucus. On June 22, Biden endorsed Barack Obama, and he was chosen on August 23, 2008 as Obama's running mate.

Clinton announced on January 20, 2007 that she would run in 2008 (the same day she announced the formation of an exploratory committee). The clear front-runner, she was widely expected to clinch the nomination early, but as of June 3, 2008, she had 1,923 delegates, 231 behind Barack Obama and 195 short of the 2,118 required to win the Democratic nomination.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_delegate_count.html She withdrew from the race and endorsed Barack Obama, as the presumptive nominee, on June 7.

In early April 2005, Feingold announced that he would be divorcing his second wife, a move which some analysts believed could diminish his chances of winning the presidential nomination. On August 17, 2005, Feingold became the first U.S. Senator to publicly support a firm date for withdrawal from the Iraq War, suggesting December 31, 2006, as a reasonable date. Feingold's stance was generally criticized by other Democratic senators, including Biden and Clinton. In December 2005, he led the Senate campaign against the renewal of the Patriot Act; following his anti-war and bi-partisan rule of law positions in the 2006 Congressional Elections, Feingold commented that the legislative victory \"pushes me in both directions,\" and he \"could make a decision on a presidential run before the end of the year\". However, on November 12, 2006, Feingold ruled out a 2008 presidential candidacy, noting that he was willing to consider an offer from the eventual nominee for the vice presidency.

February 2, 2007 The meaning of these remarks became clearer when on award night, while in attendance and acting as a presenter for an award, Gore began a speech that seemed to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president.

Through Keeping America's Promise, Kerry claimed to have raised or given away over $14 million to nearly 300 progressive candidates, committees or causes. Kerry told CNN, with respect to a run in 2008, \"it's crazy to be thinking about it now\" but went on to say that \"I'll make my judgment when the time comes and I don't care what history says.\" However, there was a controversy on October 30, 2006, over a comment Kerry made on the war in Iraq during a speech at Pasadena City College. Kerry claimed the incident would have little bearing on 2008 and that he would make a decision in early 2007. On January 24, 2007, Kerry announced that he would not seek the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2008.
