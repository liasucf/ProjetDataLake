Strni\u0161\u010de ==Sterntal Concentration Camp== The Sterntal Concentration Camp (, ) was located in Kidri\u010devo. It was a central collection point for the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Slovenia (Ostsiedlung) after the Second World War. The roots of the camp go back to a prisoner of war camp from the First World War, later used as a refugee camp for people displaced by the Battles of the Isonzo. In 1941, the German occupation authorities () established a prisoner of war camp at the site to provide labor to build an aluminum smelter (the plant was not completed until 1947\u20131954, using forced labor by political prisoners from postwar camps). At the beginning of 1942, the camp contained 1,076 workers, 185 criminal internees, and 89 prisoners of war. In 1944, family members of deserters were also forced to work at the camp. In May 1945, under the direction of Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107, the Yugoslav secret police (OZNA) established a concentration camp at the site to collect ethnic Germans from across Slovenia, especially from Lower Styria and Gottschee. Ethnic Hungarians from Prekmurje were also sent to the camp.Mikola, Milko. 2008. \"Concentration and Labour Camps in Slovenia.\" In: Peter Jambrek (ed.), Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes, pp. 145\u2013154. Ljubljana: Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, p. 147. Overcrowding and poor hygiene at the camp caused many of the inmates to die from amoebiasis and typhoid fever.Conze, Werner, & Hartmut Boockmann. 2002. Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas, vol. 7. Munich: Siedler, p. 419. The inmates were also physically and mentally tortured, and many were shot. Tortures included forcing the prisoners to lie on the ground while their captors rode motorcycles over them.\u0160am\u0161erl, Janez. 2012. \"O sveti kri\u017e, \u017eivljenja lu\u010d, o sveti kri\u017e, nebe\u0161ki klju\u010d!\" Dru\u017eina (4 March).
