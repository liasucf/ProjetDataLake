The officer blocked the student's car as the student attempted to leave the school parking lot, first threatening him with suspension and then telling the student, \"You\u2019re going to get shot, you come another fucking foot closer to me\". Additionally, Cindy Bond, a white discipline assistant, claimed the student used a racial slur to address her during the incident, although a body camera recording of the encounter showed that the student did not curse or use racial slurs. Following the shooting threat, the school expelled the student. The sheriff's office opened an internal investigation, however no discipline action was taken against the officer, who continues to work at the school following the incident. ==Principals of River Ridge== * Robert Dorn, 1991 - 1995 * Tina Tiede, 1995 - 2000 * Tammy Rabon, 2000 - 2004 * Jim Michaels, 2004 - 2009 * Maria Swanson, 2009 - 2015 * Toni Zetzsche, 2015 - present ==Notable alumni== * Ryan Benjamin, former NFL long snapper, Tampa Bay Buccaneers * Landon Anthony \"Lando\" Vannata, UFC Fighter * AJ Agazarm, Bellator Fighter * Caveman Miller, Executive Producer - The Bubba the Love Sponge Show ==References== Category:High schools in Pasco County, Florida Category:Public high schools in Florida Category:Public middle schools in Florida Category:1991 establishments in Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 1991 Category:New Port Richey, Florida ",
