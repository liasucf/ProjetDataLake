The island is named for a local legend of a sea captain taking his beloved there to propose to her.Ralph Friedman, In Search of Western Oregon (1990), p. 40. The proposal was from Charley Gage to Della Page sometime around 1900. Della's mother, Sarah, then dubbed it Proposal Rock to mark the occasion. Proposal Rock was originally called \u201cSchlock\u201d by the Native Americans who first lived there. ==See also== *Neskowin Ghost Forest ==References== ==External links== * Category:Pacific islands of Oregon Category:Landforms of Tillamook County, Oregon ",
