In: Journal of Human Evolution Vol. 147: 102866; October 2020; doi: 10.1016/j.jhevol.2020.102866 Mesopithecus resembled a modern macaque, with a body length of about . It was adapted to both walking and climbing, possessing a slender body with long, muscular limbs and flexible fingers. Its teeth suggest that it primarily ate soft leaves and fruit. Nonetheless, it was once thought that these extinct monkeys might be an ancestor of the grey langur, but a more recent study suggests that they are more closely related to the snub-nosed monkeys and doucs. ==Gallery== Mesopithecus pentelici.JPG|Mesopithecus pentelici skulls Les anc\u00eatres de nos animaux dans les temps g\u00e9ologiques (Page 115, Fig. 31) white background.jpg|Skeletal restoration ==References== ==External links== * Rare Mesopithecus skull unearthed in Chalkidiki Category:Prehistoric monkeys Category:Miocene primates of Europe Category:Pliocene primates Category:Miocene primates of Asia Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Prehistoric mammals of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 1839 ",
