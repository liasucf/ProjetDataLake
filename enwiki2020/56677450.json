They started interviewing local Chicago blues musicians, and, with others, founded Living Blues the same year. Graydon Megan, \"Amy van Singel, blues aficionado, radio host, dies at 66\", Chicago Tribune, October 19, 2016 O'Neal said: \"We embarked on a mission to bring recognition to the blues originators and the living African American blues tradition, first with some interviews we sent to Blues Unlimited.... I didn\u2019t have to hide my record-buying habit from my wife. We shared in that pursuit and just about everything else, loving the blues and our life together. We decided not to have children, but poured our energy into birthing and parenting Living Blues.\" \"Amy van Singel\", Living Blues She and O'Neal published the magazine from their home in Chicago until 1983, when production moved to Oxford, Mississippi.
