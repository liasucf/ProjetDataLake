    "text": "Sven Ulreich (born 3 August 1988) is a German professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for 2. Bundesliga side Hamburger SV. ==Club career== ===VfB Stuttgart=== He was Stuttgart II's first-choice goalkeeper during their first four matches of the 2007\u201308 Regionalliga season, keeping two clean sheets in that period. He played 10 matches during the previous season, receiving two yellow cards. In January 2008, he was promoted to the first team of VfB Stuttgart. But he also played again for the reserve team. He made his first team debut on 9 February 2008, in the 3\u20131 loss to Hertha BSC and earned his first victory as the starting goalkeeper on 16 February 2008, against MSV Duisburg. On 6 April 2010, Ulreich extended his contract at VfB Stuttgart until the summer of 2013. On 20 January 2012 he extended his contract until June 2017. For the 2015\u201316 season, Ulreich moved to Bayern Munich. He had been at Stuttgart since 1998. ===Bayern Munich=== Ulreich transferred to Bayern prior to the 2015\u201316 season and signed a contract until 2018. He was on the substitutes' bench for the 2015 DFL-Supercup. He finished the 2015\u201316 season with three appearances. He finished the 2016\u201317 season with seven appearances. He was able to feature regularly for Bayern Munich during the 2017\u201318 season, due to a long-term injury to first-choice goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Ulreich started the 2017\u201318 season by playing in the German Super Cup. Ulreich played a key role in guiding Bayern Munich to a record sixth successive German Bundesliga title, which was confirmed in a 1\u20134 win away at FC Augsburg on 7 April 2018. However, Bayern Munich were eliminated from 2017\u201318 Champions League partly due to a goalkeeping error by Ulreich against Real Madrid in semi-finals. Bayern lost 4\u20133 on aggregate. In total, he made 47 appearances in the 2017\u201318 season. ==International career== Ulreich with Germany Under-21s Ulreich was also a member of the Germany U16, Germany U19, Germany U21 teams and received a call-up for the senior team. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club!!rowspan=\"2\"|Season!!colspan=\"3\"|League!!colspan=\"2\"|Cup!!colspan=\"2\"|Continental!!colspan=\"2\"|Other!!colspan=\"2\"|Total!!rowspan=\"2\"| |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Stuttgart II||2006\u201307||Regionalliga S\u00fcd||10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||0|| |- |2007\u201308||Regionalliga S\u00fcd||19||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||0|| |- |2008\u201309||3.
