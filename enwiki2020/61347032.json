The Spanish broadcaster Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (TVE) organised an internal selection to select the Spanish entry. ==Background== Prior to the 2019 Contest, Spain had participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in four consecutive years since its debut in the inaugural Contest, having won the contest on their second appearance with the song \"Antes muerta que sencilla\", performed by Mar\u00eda Isabel. Spain came second twice, in both 2003 and , and the remaining Spanish entrant finished in fourth position in . The Spanish broadcaster TVE did not return to the contest in , saying that \"the Junior Eurovision promotes stereotypes we do not share\". On 25 June 2019, TVE announced that they would return to the contest in 2019, after a 13-year absence. ==Artist and song information== Melani Garc\u00eda during her performance. Melani Garc\u00eda was announced as the Spanish entrant on 24 July 2019 during the talk show A partir de hoy, hosted by M\u00e1ximo Huerta and aired on La 1. Her entry's title, \"Marte\", and a preview of the song were released to the public on 20 September 2019. The song was written and produced by Pablo Mora alongside Manu Chalud, with the collaboration of Melani Garc\u00eda and it was released in full on 4 October 2019. ==At Junior Eurovision== During the opening ceremony and the running order draw which both took place on 18 November 2019, Spain was drawn to perform fifth on 24 November 2019, following North Macedonia and preceding Georgia. Melani was accompanied on stage by Edurne Rodriguez, Yara D\u00edez, Violeta Leal and Mar\u00eda Mihali. ===Voting=== The results of the contest were determined by national juries and an online audience vote. Each country had a national jury that consisted of three music industry professionals and two children aged between 10 and 15 who were citizens of the country they represent. This jury judged each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they could not vote impartially and independently. The first phase of the online voting started on 22 November 2019 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances was shown on junioreurovision.tv before the viewers could vote. After this, voters also had the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant\u2019s rehearsal. This first round of voting ended on Sunday 24 November, at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting took place during the live show and started immediately after the last performance and was open for 15 minutes. International viewers could vote for a minimum of three countries and a maximum of five. They could also vote for their own country\u2019s song. These votes were be turned into points which were determined by the percentage of votes received. For example, if a song received 20% of the votes, it would receive 20% of the available points. The public vote counted for 50% of the final result, while the other 50% came from the professional juries. ===Points awarded to Spain=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"5\"| Jury |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * |} * Spain received 104 points from Online voting. ===Points awarded by Spain=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ====Split voting results==== The following five members comprised the Spanish jury: *Mar\u00eda Isabel \u2013 Winner of the contest representing *Pablo Pinilla \u2013 Chairperson \u2013 composer, songwriter, producer *Natalia Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 singer, composer, television host *Ginebra \u2013 Kid from Community of Madrid Orchestra *Jorge \u2013 Kid from Community of Madrid Orchestra {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !colspan=10| Split voting results from Spain |- !
