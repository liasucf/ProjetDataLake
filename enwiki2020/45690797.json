This was planned to be completed in time for the 2015 European Cultural Capital events, but at present, although the previous station has been demolished, only parts of the planned bridges have been built, with a temporary station and set of temporary bridges providing substitute service for now. The budget for the new station has grown by more than 4 times (from 37 million Euros to 155 million Euros), and the earliest likely completion date was 2018. ==See also== * List of railway stations in Belgium ==References== ==External links== * * Mons railway station at Belgian Railways website Category:Railway stations in Belgium Category:Railway stations opened in 1841 Category:Railway stations in Hainaut (province) Category:Mons ",
