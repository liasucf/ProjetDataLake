    "text": "Baillonella toxisperma (also called African pearwood, djave nut, or moabi) is a species of tree in the family Sapotaceae, and the only species in the genus Baillonella. It is found in Angola, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Nigeria. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. The moabi tree's nut oil is a key component of Baka and other indigenous people's subsistence. ==Conservation== Baillonella toxisperma is declining over large parts of its range due to overexploitation, as it is both a highly desired hardwood for international export, and can provide a locally prized edible oil. Although minimum diameter logging restrictions are in place, the species appears to be in decline and has been classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. The building products retailer The Home Depot has included B. toxisperma on their list of endangered hardwoods that will not be sourced by the company, and thus will no longer sell products made of it. ==References== Category:Sapotoideae Category:Monotypic Ericales genera Category:Trees of Africa Category:Flora of West-Central Tropical Africa Category:Flora of Nigeria Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Sapotaceae genera ",
