    "text": "Painting Life is a 2018 Indian English film written and directed by Bijukumar Damodaran commonly known as Dr. Biju. The film jointly produced by Silicon Media and BlueOcean Pictures depicts the experience of a film crew which gets stranded in a remote Himalayan village. ==Plot== The crew led by a hit Bollywood filmmaker arrives there to shoot a song and dance sequence for their upcoming blockbuster. Soon they find themselves cut off from the outside world after torrential downpours and landslides. They are trapped with no basic amenities or means of communication and are totally at the mercy of the forces of nature. The team, having been accustomed only to the breakneck pace and luxury of urban life, struggles to cope with the total isolation and the rough conditions. They are forced to interface closely with nature and the local folk and experience life at a much gentler pace. They also get exposed to the challenges faced by the local people. For the director, who has been highly successful commercially, cinema is mainly an entertainment business with no connect to the real world or social issues. He saw the valley as merely a picturesque locale for his shoot. Through a series of intense and unforgettable experiences, he begins to see the reality beyond. His eyes open to the travails of the breathtakingly beautiful land and its beleaguered residents. How those eventful days under siege, affect the thoughts and priorities of the filmmaker, both on the personal and filmmaking fronts, forms the central theme of the film. ==Cast== * Prakash Bare as Filmmaker * Geetanjali Thapa as Lady in the guest house * Shankar Ramakrishnan as Nassar * Ritabhari Chakraborty as Actress * Meera Vasudev as Wife (Guest appearance) * Ravi Singh as Cinematographer * Purav Goswami as Associate Director * Krishnan Balakrishnan as Asst Director * Melwyn Williams as Production Controller * Noksha Saham as Hunter * Phuntsok Ladakhi as Monk * Tensing Lepcha as Hotel boy * Kinsong Bhutia as Guesthouse manager * Govardhan BK as Hotel boy * Yangcho Bhutia as Girl from the village * Arjun Subba as Boy from the village ==Crew== Painting Life is the first English feature film directed by Dr. Biju, whose earlier eight films have won five national film awards, four Indian panorama selections, thirteen kerala state film awards and many other national and international accolades including selections to reputed film festivals like Cannes, Montreal, Cairo, Iran, Shanghai, Eurasia, Telluride, Jeonju, Tallinn, IFFK, IFFI and NYIFF.
