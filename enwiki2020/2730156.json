    "text": "The Genitorturers are an industrial metal band from the United States, with influences extending into the 1990s hardcore punk and electronic music. They proclaim themselves to be \"The World's Sexiest Rock Band\". ==History== Originating in Orlando, Florida, the band was founded by lead singer Gen while attending college. Originally called The Festering Genitorturers, the band consisted of Marisa (vocals), Yvonne (guitar), Gen (bass), Larry (guitar) and Mike (drums). Their first performance was at the Ocean Club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in late 1986. Also on the bill was Declared Ungovernable, Belching Penguins, and The Rhythm Pigs. Shortening their name to The Genitorturers, the band underwent various personnel changes and progressed in the 1990s Florida \"hardcore\" music scene, with contemporary bands such as Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids, who would also become a success in later years. According to the band's official biography, \"What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that 'Mickey' built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide\". In 1993, IRS Records owner Miles Copeland III sent his assistant Nick Turner (former drummer for The Lords of the New Church) to see the band perform. The quality of the performance, as well as their musical style containing fused elements of hardcore punk, metal and industrial electronics, led them to a record contract. Soon after that, they would record 120 Days of Genitorture. After recording this album, Morbid Angel bassist/vocalist David Vincent (Gen's husband) joined the Genitorturers on bass. He left Morbid Angel in 1995, after the album Domination, to join his wife's band. The band has extensively toured the United States, Japan, and Europe, and is internationally renowned for its exploits and erotic show content. By the time of their second album Sin City in 1998, Genitorturers had gained a notable reputation with their flamboyant BDSM-themed shows resulting in the band appearing in various television features in the USA; including VH1, Fox News, Hard Copy, HBO's Real Sex and Playboy TV's Sexcetera. The Flesh is the Law EP includes the track \"Lecher Bitch\", which was also included in the November 2004 video game Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines. Earlier releases included Machine Love, which contains a cover of Divinyls' hit \"I Touch Myself\", which was produced by Dave Ogilvie and Rob Zombie producer Scott Humphrey. In 2004, Genitorturers featured in a 12-page spread in the monthly pornographic publication Hustler, the magazine's only multi-page spread with a rock band. Hustler described Genitorturers as \"the world's sexiest band\". In 2006, they toured Australia with Dead Inside the Chrysalis. In the autumn of 2007, they released their live DVD Live in Sin, also selling autographed copies on eBay. The band's last album, Blackheart Revolution, was released in 2009. In 2014, Genitorturers celebrated over 20 years since the release of their debut album by going on tour, '20 Years of Depravity'. ==Members== *Gen - lead vocals (1986\u2013present) *Eric Griffin - guitars, backing vocals (2009\u2013present) *Kriz D.K. - drums (2011\u2013present) *Abbey Nex - bass, backing vocals (2004-2009, 2019\u2013present) ==Former members== ;Guitars *Yvonne Lievano - guitars (1986-1989) *Scott Beckey - guitars (1989\u20131991) *Jerry \u00d4utlaw - guitars (1991\u20131994) *Chuck \"Chains\" Lenihan - guitars (1995\u20132002) *Bizz - guitars (2003\u20132009) ;Bass *Pawe\u0142 M\u0105ciwoda - bass (1990) *David \"Evil D\" Vincent - bass, backing vocals (1990-1992, 1994-2004) *Sean Colpoys - bass (1992\u20131994) *Ryan Seelbach - bass (2009-2019) ;Drums *AW Reckart - drums (1991\u20131993) *H-Bomb - drums (1993\u20131997) *Racci Shay - drums (1997\u20132001) *Angel Bartolotta - drums (2001-2005, 2006\u20132009) *Joe Letz - drums (2005\u20132006) *Sean Davidson - drums (2009\u20132011) ;Keyboards *James Creer - keyboards (1994\u20131995) *Vinnie Saletto - keyboards (1995\u20131999) == Discography == ;Studio albums * 120 Days of Genitorture (1993) * Sin City (1998) * Blackheart Revolution (2009) ;Remix albums * Machine Love (2000) ;Extended plays * Flesh Is the Law (2002) * Touch Myself EP (2009) ;Videos * Society of Genitorture (VHS) (1997) * The Society of Genitorture (DVD) (2001) * Live in Sin (DVD) (2007) ;Movie soundtrack appearances *The Society of Genitorture (1997) *Raging Hormones (1999) *Bike Week Exposed (2003) *Vampire Clan (2002) ;Video game soundtrack appearances *True Crime: Streets of LA (2004) *Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines (2004) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1991 establishments in Florida Category:American industrial metal musical groups Category:American industrial music groups Category:BDSM people Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Florida Category:Musical groups from Orlando, Florida Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Musical quartets ",
