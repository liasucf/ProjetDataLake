    "text": "Fortunato Arriola (1827\u20131872), born in Cosal\u00e1, Sinaloa, Mexico, was a painter of portraits and luminous tropical landscapes that were very popular in San Francisco, California, where he came to live in 1857. The son of a wealthy landowner, Arriola was a handsome, distinguished and cultivated man. He was self-taught as an artist and began his career painting portraits. He had a studio near the corner of Kearney and Clay Streets that was a gathering place for Mexican exiles, a place of intellectual ferment and the occasional brawl. Among his students were Toby Rosenthal and Ransom Holdredge.Birgitta Hjalmarson (1999). Artful Players: Artistic Life in Early San Francisco. Balcony Press, Los Angeles Most of his works, imagined views of Central America, disappeared after he died.
