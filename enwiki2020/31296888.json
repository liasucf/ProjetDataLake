He entered the Society of Jesus on 22 March 1583, and taught Theology for twenty-two years at W\u00fcrzburg, Mainz, and Vienna. He died in Vienna, where he was the confessor to the Emperor Ferdinand II. ==Works== A first class controversialist and prolific writer Becanus is the author of some 37 books, most of them works of polemics. *He developed the art of controversy and taught it in his book : Manuale controversiarumn huius temporis published in Wurzburg (1623), that went into more than 50 editions (in the shortened version until the late 18th century).Werner Raupp: Art. Becanus, Martinus, in: VL 17 (cf. References), vol. 1, 2019, col. 491, 497. *In De fide haereticis servanda (1607) he defended the view that Protestants and Catholics should observe contracts concluded between one another.Wim Decock, Trust Beyond Faith. Re-Thinking Contracts with Heretics and Excommunicates in Times of Religious War, Rivista internazionale di diritto comune, 27 (2016), 301-328 *Another book had much success: Analogia veteris et novi Testamenti. *He supported Cardinal Bellarmine in the major allegiance oath controversy with James I of England, publishing six books in the period 1610 to 1613, one against William Tooker and another being directed at Lancelot Andrewes. At the time he was based in Mainz; he was brought into the front line of the discussion of Bellarmine's Apologia by Attileo Amalteo, the nuncio at Cologne.W. B.
