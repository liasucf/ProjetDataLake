    "text": "Thomas Francis O'Higgins (23 July 1916 \u2013 25 February 2003) was an Irish Fine Gael politician, barrister and judge who served as Chief Justice of Ireland from 1974 to 1985, a Judge of the Supreme Court from 1974 to 1985, a Judge of the European Court of Justice from 1985 to 1991, a Judge of the High Court from 1973 to 1974, Deputy Leader of Fine Gael from 1972 to 1977 and Minister for Health from 1954 to 1957. O'Higgins was born in Cork in 1916, and came from the influential political family of O'Higgins. He was the son of Thomas F. O'Higgins and the nephew of Kevin O'Higgins. He was educated at St Mary's College, Dublin, Clongowes Wood College and University College Dublin, where he became auditor of the Literary and Historical Society. He later attended King's Inns. In 1938, he qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar. In 1954, he was called to the Inner Bar. O'Higgins was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Leix\u2013Offaly constituency at the 1948 general election. On the same day his brother, Michael O'Higgins, was also elected a TD. In the Second Inter-Party Government (1954\u201357) O'Higgins was appointed Minister for Health. During his period as Minister for Health he introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI). During the 1960s, O'Higgins worked closely with Garret FitzGerald and Declan Costello in re-shaping Fine Gael. O'Higgins was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate in the 1966 presidential election. He faced the incumbent president and Fianna F\u00e1il candidate \u00c9amon de Valera. O'Higgins came within 1% of beating de Valera, which was much better than he had hoped. In 1973, O'Higgins was again chosen once again as the Fine Gael candidate in the presidential election. This time he faced former Fianna F\u00e1il T\u00e1naiste and Minister, Erskine H. Childers. Childers was elected by 52% to 48%. Shortly afterwards O'Higgins was appointed a Judge of the High Court. In 1974, after the sudden death of Chief Justice William FitzGerald, O'Higgins, although the most junior High Court judge, was chosen to replace him as Chief Justice of Ireland in the Supreme Court and a Judge of the Supreme Court. After the sudden death of Erskine H. Childers, O'Higgins, in his role as Chief Justice swore in Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh as President of Ireland. He was Chief Justice until 1985, when he was appointed a Judge of the European Court of Justice. He remained there until 1991. O'Higgins died on 25 February 2003, at the age of 86. ==See also== *List of members of the European Court of Justice *Families in the Oireachtas *Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA ==References== Category:1916 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Fine Gael TDs Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il Category:Politicians from County Cork Category:European Court of Justice judges Category:Chief Justices of Ireland Category:Candidates for President of Ireland Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Ministers for Health (Ireland) Category:High Court judges (Ireland) Category:People educated at Clongowes Wood College Category:Irish judges of international courts and tribunals Category:Alumni of King's Inns Category:People educated at St Mary's College, Dublin ",
