    "text": "The Sony \u03b19 (the \u03b1 is sometimes spelled out as Alpha), Model ILCE-9, is a full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera. It was Sony's flagship camera as of 2017. The camera is not the successor to the \u03b17 line of digital cameras but supplements it. Announced on 19 April 2017, the \u03b19 is characterized by Sony as a true professional mirrorless camera system. The \u03b19 is being compared with the Nikon D5 and the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II. Sony initially priced the \u03b19 at $4,499 with an availability date in May 2017. The headline feature of the \u03b19 is the 20 frames per second with a buffer of 240 raw or 362 JPEG images. This is accomplished without temporarily blacking out the finder for each exposure, unlike a DSLR. == Features == * Stacked Exmor RS CMOS Sensor full-frame sensor * 693-point focal-plane phase detection AF * 5-axis image stabilization * LCD touchscreen (3 inch/7.5 cm) with tilt functionality * 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) electronic viewfinder * 1200-zone evaluative light metering * Built-in Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth * LAN input for transferring files via FTP * LED-auto focus illuminator * Multi Interface Shoe * My Menu system with up to 72 assignable functions * Joystick for positioning of the 693 focus points * Dual memory card slots, one for UHS-I and one for UHS-II. == Reception == Initial hands-on of the \u03b19 have been positive with multiple reviewers praising the company for listening to its users.
