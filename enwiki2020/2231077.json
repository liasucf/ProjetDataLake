He was the artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet from 2011 to 2014.

He became involved with classical dance through his older sister, who was taking a class. Before that, both he and his sister took gymnastics classes. His first ballet teacher, Jo Jean Retrum, was interested in getting Ethan to take class because boys in ballet are a rarity. He studied for two years at the Milwaukee Ballet School under Ted Kivitt and Paul Sutherland, and at the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet before moving to New York City to attend the School of American Ballet on scholarship. While there, Stanley Williams enrolled him in the company's men's special class where he trained alongside Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Fernando Bujones. He studied with Baryshnikov himself at the short-lived Mikhail Baryshnikov's School of Classical Ballet. ==Career== ===Dancing=== He started his dancing career in 1989, when he joined the corps de ballet of New York City Ballet at age 16. In 1992, he took a leave of absence to perform with the Z\u00fcrich Ballet, under directorship of Bernd R. Bienert, but returned to NYCB a year later as a soloist. By 1995, he was a principal dancer with the company. He ended his tenure with NYCB in April 1997 when he joined ABT as a principal dancer, from which he retired in 2012.

He also starred in the sequels Center Stage: Turn It Up and Center Stage: On Pointe.

He was someone I've looked up to all throughout my life.\" *\"I enjoy what I do, so why not just go about it in a good way, a positive way? I don't concern myself with becoming a star. I just go out there and try to give an honest performance and if, when I get offstage, I'm a complete schmuck, then that's me.\" *\"When I'm done with ballet, I'd just like to work on motorcycles. I have two.\" *\"I actually quit ballet when I was 14. I had just gotten a scholarship to the School of American Ballet, but it was so far away and there was no other school I liked nearby.\" *\"But then my father was transferred to New York, and ... I knew this was it. I saw the bright lights, big city, the professional companies and great dancers. I was in a great school and knew that this was serious business and I had to do it.\" *\"Dancing exacts a toll. I don't dance for applause. But there have definitely been moments, when I've been injured, when I say to myself, 'To come back to this, is it really worth it. It's just tough. It takes so much out of you physically and there's a lot of stress involved. Emotionally, it can drain you. I travel around a lot and it's great, it's exciting, but I don't see any of it. I do my shows and I'm off to the next place.\" *\"I always worry about my line. At the same time, I\u2019m lucky: I have the feet that I\u2019ve been given. Hopefully they\u2019ll keep pointing for two more shows.\" *\"Julie and I first started working together in the late '90s at ABT. I danced some of my first roles and debuts with her. I think my favorite ballet with Julie was 'Romeo and Juliet'. You never forget your first Juliet.\" ==References== ==External links== *Official Bio at ABT Website *Abt Announces 2013 Spring Season At Metropolitan Opera House May 13-July 6, 2013 * * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tyrone, Pennsylvania Category:American male ballet dancers Category:Prix de Lausanne winners Category:American male film actors Category:New York City Ballet principal dancers Category:American Ballet Theatre principal dancers Category:Princess Grace Awards winners Category:University of North Carolina School of the Arts faculty Category:Artistic directors Category:School of American Ballet alumni Category:Dance in North Carolina ",
