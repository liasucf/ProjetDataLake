The Siberian Route (; Sibirsky trakt), also known as the Moscow Highway (, \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442) and Great Highway (, \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442), was a historic route that connected European Russia to Siberia and China. ==History== Monument marking the dividing line between Asia and Europe on the Siberian Route coordinate:56\u00b049\u203255.7\u2033N 60\u00b021\u203202.60\u2033E The construction of the road was decreed by the Tsar and was not finished until the mid-19th century. Previously, Siberian transport had been mostly by river via Siberian River Routes. The first Russian settlers arrived in Siberia by the Cherdyn river route which was superseded by the Babinov overland route in the late 1590s. The town of Verkhoturye in the Urals was the most eastern point of the Babinov Road. The much longer Siberian route started in Moscow as the Vladimir Highway and passed through Murom, Kozmodemyansk, Kazan, Perm, Kungur, Yekaterinburg, Tyumen, Tobolsk, Tara, Kainsk, Tomsk, Yeniseysk and Irkutsk. After crossing Lake Baikal the road split near Verkhneudinsk. One branch continued east to Nerchinsk while the other went south to the border post of Kyakhta where it linked to camel caravans that crossed Mongolia to a Great Wall gate at Kalgan. In the early 19th century, the route was moved to the south. From Tyumen the road proceeded through Yalutorovsk, Ishim, Omsk, Tomsk, Achinsk and Krasnoyarsk before rejoining the older route at Irkutsk. It remained a vital artery connecting Siberia with Moscow and Europe until the last decades of the 19th century, when it was superseded by the Trans-Siberian Railway and Amur Cart Road. The automobile equivalent is the Trans-Siberian Highway.

Charles Wenyon, who passed by the \"Great Post Road\" in 1893, subscribed to the popular belief that \"the best tea produced in China goes to Russia\".Wenyon, Charles. Across Siberia on the Great Post-road. Charles H. Kelly, London, 1896, Page 76 (reprinted by Ayer Publishing, 1971). In 1915, China exported to Siberia 70,297 tons of tea, which accounted for 65% of the country's overall tea exports.M. I. Sladkovskii. History of Economic Relations Between Russia & China. Transaction Publishers, 2007. . Page 129. The route is the namesake of the Russian Caravan blend of tea. It was imported primarily in the form of hefty hard-packed tea bricks which allowed each camel to carry large quantities in a more compact mannerMary Lou Heiss, Robert J. Heiss. The Story of Tea: A Cultural, History and Drinking Guide. Ten Speed Press, 2007. . Page 211. and could also pass for units of currency. From Kyakhta, tea was transported to the Irbit fair for further commercial transactions. Another popular Chinese import item was dried rhubarb root, which was sold west of St. Petersburg \"for fifteen times what it cost in Kyakhta\".W. Bruce Lincoln.
