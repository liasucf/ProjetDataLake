Kriukow, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0457\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0443\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430) was a Ukrainian painter. == Life and work == Olga Gurski traces her descent from an old Ukrainian, formerly Polish, and before that Czech nobility of the 13th century, of the Sternberg coat of arms.Lidia Kriukow: \"Shlyakhetstvo Ol'hy z rodu Gurs'kykh herbu 'Sternberg' \". Skarbnytsya ukrayins'koyi kultury. Zb. naukovykh prats'. Vyp. 11. Chernihiv, 2009. p. 75\u201389.Lidia Kriukow: \"Das Wappen Sternberg in der Ukraine\". FEMINA-\u03b1 , # 12, 2013, Book I, p. 23\u201335. It should be mentioned that, fearing the Soviet Russian repressions, she buried the documents she was entrusted with by her dying father, \u2014 some of them dating from the 18th century, when the old lineage settled in Chernihiv (Ukraine) \u2014 and only disintered them in 1943, during World War II. She graduated from the Kyiv Art School in 1929. In 1943, she moved to the West: at first to Lviv, later to Austria. There, having settled in Gmunden, on the Lake Traun, she took part in various art exhibitions (Linz, Salzburg), where her paintings were highly praised by the critics. In 1948, she emigrated to Argentina, took up her residence in Buenos Aires, and became a citizen of that country. Exhibitions of her paintings were held almost every year in Buenos Aires' renowned art galleries, such as M\u00fcller, Van Riel, Whitcomb, etc., and in the United States and Canada as well. From the Buenos Aires Provincial Government, she received a special invitation to exhibit her works in Mar del Plata, the famous sea side resort. Colored plates of some of her canvases illustrated the women's magazine \"Para t\u00ed\". After numerous experiments concerning a painting technique to adopt, she definitely turned to a manner which can best be described as a late Post-impressionism, where, as quoted be the art critic Pedro H. Bidart, \"the colors flow like a piece of music by Ravel, or Debussy\". == Exhibitions == === Some exhibition (incomplete) === *1943 \u2014 Ukrainian Central Committee.
