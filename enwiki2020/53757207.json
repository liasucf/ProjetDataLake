    "text": "Sully railway station served the coastal town of Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan until the 1960s. ==History and description== The station was opened by the Taff Vale Railway. In comparison with the lightly-built stations elsewhere on the Cadoxton Branch, Sully was a substantial station, with two long platforms, linked by a metal footbridge, a building on each platform, a signal box and a large goods facility. The station was successful in its early years, used by large amounts of tourist traffic.Hutton, J. The Taff Vale Railway Volume III. Silver Link. 2006, p. 44 The Cadoxton branch fell on leaner times in the mid-20th Century. Sully closed to goods in 1963. Its signal box was taken out of use in 1965 Passenger closure followed in 1968 when the line was truncated at Penarth . No trace of the station survives. The site is now occupied by a telephone exchange.Hutton, J. Taff Vale Railway Miscellany.
