    "text": "Ferdinand Gasse (1780) was a French violinist and composer. ==Life== Born in Naples, Gasse, who was probably related to the architect Louis-Silvestre Gasse, born eight years later in Naples, attended the violin class of Pierre Rode at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1798. He also had lessons with Rodolphe Kreutzer, the dedicatee of Beethoven's famous Kreutzer-Sonata. He also studied harmony with Charles-Simon Catel and musical composition with Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Gossec. From 1801 Gasse was violinist at the Paris Opera. In 1805 he received the deuxi\u00e8me Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata Cupidon pleurant Psych\u00e9 (after a text by Antoine-Vincent Arnault). During his stay in Rome he composed, among others, a double choir Te Deum and a Christe eleison, works which were applauded by \u00c9tienne-Nicolas M\u00e9hul. From 1810 to 1812 Gasse stayed in Naples before coming to Paris, where he resumed his activity as violinist at the Grand Op\u00e9ra after the interruption of his stay in Italy. In the year of his arrival, his op\u00e9ra bouffe La finta Zingara was premiered here. In 1834 Gasse retired with a pension; his exact date of death is not known. In addition to several other operas, Gasse composed mainly works for the violin. It is assumed that Gasse was the father of Edme-Hippolyte Gasse. The pupil of Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis and Henri-Montan Berton taught solf\u00e8ge at the Conservatoire de Paris and died early on 11 January 1831. ==Selected works== ===Operas=== * La Finta Zingara, 1812 * Le Voyage incognito, 1819 * L'Idiote, 1820 * Une Nuit de Gustav Wasa, 1825 * L'Ange gardien ou Soeur Marie, 1831 ===Publications=== * M\u00e9thode de violon, 1803 * Cours de musique, 1830 ==References== ==External links== * Palmar\u00e8s de tous les laur\u00e9ats du Prix de Rome en composition musicale * Ferdinand Gasse on BNF Category:1780 deaths Category:1840s deaths Category:19th-century French composers Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French classical composers Category:French classical violinists Category:French male classical composers Category:French opera composers Category:French Romantic composers Category:18th-century Neapolitan people Category:Male classical violinists Category:19th-century Neapolitan people ",
