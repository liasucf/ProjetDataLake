    "text": "Rush, Endacott and Rush was an American architectural firm known for its designs in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from 1912 to 1929. Principals A. William Rush, a civil engineer, and his son, Edwin Arthur Rush, were partners in the predecessor firm A.W. Rush and Son in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and later in Chicago, Illinois, between 1891 and 1912. The firm moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and formed Rush, Endacott and Rush with Asbury Endacott. A.W. Rush retired in 1913 and died in 1923, but his name remained on the firm until 1929. Noted architect Bruce Goff was apprenticed at the age of 12 to Rush, Endacott and Rush, and briefly became a partner in the successor firm Rush, Endacott and Goff in Tulsa from 1929 to 1930. ==A.W.
