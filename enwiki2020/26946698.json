Neither team would score on their remaining drives in the first quarter. The Red Raiders first drive of the 2nd quarter ended in a Barron Batch fumble in the Lobos' end zone.

The next drive ended with a Red Raider field goal by Matt Williams for a score of 24\u20133. The Lobos first touchdown of the game came on the next drive with a B.R. Holbrook touchdown pass to Lucas Reed. James Aho kicked the extra point for the Lobos and brought the score to 24\u201310.

The Lobos scored the final score of the half after Chris Hernandez recovered his own team's fumble for a touchdown.

Phillips returned the ball 27 yards to the New Mexico 13 yard line setting the Red Raiders up for a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Steven Sheffield two plays later. Matt Williams extra point was the last score of the game, bringing the final score to 52\u201317.

New Mexico had a total of 3 turnovers, 2 interceptions and a fumble, and 2 blocked punts, in contrast to Texas Tech's 2 fumbles. ===Texas=== The Chancellor's Spurs is the traveling trophy between the Red Raiders and Texas Longhorns For the first time since the Texas Tech upset over Texas in the 2008 season the Longhorns returned to Jones AT&T; Stadium for an evening game. This game marked the 60th meeting of the two teams, and the Longhorns led the overall series with a record of 44\u201315 going into the game. At their last meeting in 2009, the Longhorns defeated the Red Raiders with a final score of 34-24. This game also marked the first sell out at the Jones AT&T; Stadium since the recent expansion was completed, and a new attendance record of 60,454 was set. Tech got off to a rocky start, with the first snap of the game going over the head of quarterback Taylor Potts. The ball was recovered by the Longhorns' Jackson Jeffcoat at Tech's 7-yard- line, and the Horns quickly scored for an early 7-0 lead. The Texas lead grew to 14-0 and the Longhorns were threatening again when Tech's Jarvis Phillips intercepted a Garrett Gilbert pass and returning it 87 yards for a touchdown. Tech tied up the game at 14-14 before halftime as Potts connected with his former high school teammate, Lyle Leong, on a fade route in the corner of the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown. The score was 17-14 in the third quarter when the Longhorns began a 22-play, 9-minute drive for a touchdown. The touchdown drive was aided by a controversial 15-yard taunting penalty against Tech's Will Ford after an incomplete Longhorn pass on 3rd down and 13 at Tech's 27-yard line. Tech's offense was held to 144 total yards in the loss. Potts threw for only 158 yards, and the Longhorns held Tech to minus-14 yards rushing.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2010-2011/tt03.html ===Iowa State=== The Texas Tech Red Raiders faced the Iowa State Cyclones at the Jack Trice Stadium in Ames, Iowa for their second road game of the season. This game marked only the ninth time the two teams have met and the start of an annual conference series. The Red Raiders dominated the overall series heading into this matchup with a record of 7-1\\. However, the Red Raiders fell 52-38 to Iowa State marking their first loss to the Cyclones since 2002. Turnovers played a big role in this meeting as Texas Tech had three (two fumbles, one interception) while the Cyclones had none. A poor first half also contributed to the Red Raider loss. ===Baylor=== The Red Raiders and Bears faced off in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, with the Red Raiders hoping to bounce back from their road loss at Iowa State. Tech was considered the \"home\" team in the second neutral-site game between the two teams; the 2009 Tech-Baylor game had been played at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. The Bears got on the board first, taking the opening kickoff and marching 82 yards before scoring on Robert Griffin's 1-yard run. Tech responded with a 9-play, 80-yard drive, knotting the score at 7-7 on a 10-yard run by Eric Stephens. Then came a special teams disaster for Tech as the Red Raiders attempted an on-side kick. However, the ball failed to travel 10 yards, and Baylor's Terrance Ganaway scooped up the ball and ran past the Tech kickoff team for an easy 38-yard touchdown and a 14-7 lead. Tech came back again, however, with a touchdown pass from Taylor Potts to Alexander Torres to tie the score again. Baylor took the lead again early in the second quarter on a Griffin TD pass to Josh Gordon, who had been arrested for marijuana possession earlier in the week after being found asleep in the drive-through lane at a Taco Bell in Waco. Trailing 21-14, the Red Raiders responded with three straight touchdowns to take a 35-21 lead. Tech scored on a 37-yard run by Baron Batch, another short touchdown pass from Potts to Torres, and a 10-yard pass from Potts to Detron Lewis with 1:38 remaining in the half. Griffin and Baylor then burned Tech's defense, with Griffin hooking up with Kendall Wright on a 62-yard touchdown pass to narrow Tech's lead to 35-28 going into halftime. In the third quarter, Tech scored on a Williams field goal to go up 38-28, and the Red Raiders extended their lead to 45-28 with a touchdown pass from Potts to Batch midway through the third quarter. The Bears added 10 points and kept Tech from scoring again, but the Red Raiders held on for the win. The Red Raiders had one of their best offensive showings of the year, with Potts throwing for 462 yards and the Red Raiders adding 169 rushing yards as they avoided their first-ever 0-3 start in Big 12 play.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/100910aaa.html ===Oklahoma State=== ===Colorado=== Down 17-7 in the third quarter, Texas Tech outscored Colorado 20-7 in the final 23:43 to win in Boulder, capped by a Matt Williams 36-yard field goal with 2:08 left. This was Texas Tech's first ever victory in Boulder, Colorado, and it occurred in the final season of Big 12 Conference play for the Buffaloes, as they will compete in the Pac-12 Conference in the 2011 football season. ===Texas A&M;=== ===Missouri=== Tech picked up its most impressive regular season win of 2010 with its win over the Tigers, ranked #14 in the AP poll and #12 in the BCS rankings. Tech fell behind early, trailing 14-0 after the Tigers scored on two of their first three possessions. Senior quarterback Steven Sheffield started the game in place of Taylor Potts, and Sheffield led Tech to a first-quarter field goal to make the score 14-3. Late in the second quarter, Potts came in at quarterback and quickly led Tech to a touchdown, an 8-yard pass to Detron Lewis.http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=303102641 Potts played the entire second half at QB for Tech, adding a pair of touchdown passes to Lyle Leong as the Tech offense got untracked. Tech moved into scoring position with a chance to extend the lead, but a Taylor Potts interception gave the Tigers a chance to tie the game. The Tech defense shut out Missouri's offense in the second half, holding Blaine Gabbert to just 12 of 30 passing and 95 passing yards for the entire game. Tech's defensive backs knocked down two potential game-tying touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to preserve the win, which improved Tech's season record to 5-4.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2010-2011/tto9.html#GAME.DEF ===Oklahoma=== ===Weber State=== Freshman Ben McRoy scores a second-half touchdown for Texas Tech during the Red Raiders' win over Weber State. Tech clinched their 11th straight bowl berth with an easy non-conference win over FCS opponent Weber State. The Red Raiders opened the game with touchdowns on their first three possessions. Taylor Potts scored on a 2-yard run and threw scoring passes to Baron Batch and Lyle Leong as Tech quickly went up 21-0. Tech's defense forced a safety late in the first quarter to give Tech a 23-0 lead. Potts threw for 272 yards before ending his day late in the 2nd quarter. Steven Sheffield came in to throw a TD pass to Aaron Crawford as Tech's second-team offense came in a few minutes before halftime. Tech's reserves played the entire second half, with Ben McRoy scoring on two touchdown runs and Matt Williams and Donnie Carona adding a field goal each as the rout continued. Sheffield completed 8 of 12 passes for 109 yards in one quarter of play, and Seth Doege completed 3 of 4 passes for 58 yards on two touchdown drives.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2010-2011/tt11.html#GAME.IND ===Houston=== The Red Raiders came into their final regular season, on Thanksgiving weekend at Jones AT&T; Stadium, seeking revenge for their 2009 road loss to the Houston Cougars. Tech's victory improved the Red Raiders' record to 7-5 and denied the Cougars bowl eligibility, as the Cougars finished with a 5-7 record. Tech took the lead early on a Taylor Potts touchdown pass to Detron Lewis, but the Cougars came back to take a 10-7 lead. Tech went up 14-10 on a 26-yard run by Eric Stephens, and the Red Raiders added to their lead with another Potts-to-Lewis touchdown throw. Potts threw second-half touchdown passes to Lyle Leong and Baron Batch as Tech pulled away for the win. The Cougars actually outgained Tech in total yardage and first downs, but Tech's defense forced three interceptions on the Cougar's freshman quarterback, David Piland, playing for the injured Case Keenum. Houston ended up with 585 total yards to Tech's 488.http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112810aaa.html ===Northwestern\u2013TicketCity Bowl=== ==Awards and honors== *Taylor Potts \u2013 AT&T; ESPN All-America Player of the Week *Eric Stevens \u2013 Big 12 Conference Player of the Weekhttp://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/091310aaa.html ==Notes== ==References== Texas Tech Category:Texas Tech Red Raiders football seasons Category:First Responder Bowl champion seasons Texas Tech Red Raiders football ",
