    "text": "Christopher Hyatt (12 July 1943 \u2013 9 February 2008), born Alan Ronald Miller, was an American occultist, author, and founder of the Extreme Individual Institute (EII). He is best known as president of New Falcon Publications. ==Early life== A native of Chicago, Alan Miller, the son of police lieutenant Leonard Miller and his wife, Bertha Freidman, was born during what he described as the \"roaring war years\". Writing and speaking as Christopher Hyatt, he gave two different accounts of the end of his high school career. In the first account, he claimed that he dropped out of high school at the age of sixteen, working instead as a dishwasher and cook, roaming around the United States. ==Occultism== Hyatt's interest in the occult began in his early twenties. His desire to further pursue his studies in magick resulted in meeting Israel Regardie in Studio City in the 1970s. Regardie introduced Hyatt to Reichian therapy, which he insisted Hyatt learn prior to any magical pursuits. Regardie further instructed Hyatt in the magical system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Hyatt was a Ninth Degree member of the occult Order Ordo Templi Orientis, and he co-founded with David Cherubim the Thelemic Order of the Golden Dawn in Los Angeles on the Vernal Equinox of 1990. ==Academic career== Hyatt was trained in experimental and clinical psychology and practiced as a psychotherapist for many years. As Alan Miller, he used the 18 units earned from his military GED towards his first academic career at Los Angeles City College, where he studied accounting for two years. He later changed his graduate to General Psychology, earning Masters Degrees in experimental psychology and medical education and Counseling. He was a member of a Freudian clinic in Southern California. He spent almost a year studying hypnosis at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute in Los Angeles and also studied hypnosis at the University of California, Irvine. Miller possessed Ph.D.s in both clinical psychology and human behavior and was a Postdoctoral researcher in Criminal Justice. Some of his techniques blended Reichian physiotherapy and tantric yoga. He also incorporated hypnosis alongside his bodywork with patients and students. According to his website: \"He left academia and state sponsored psychology to become an explorer of the human mind.\" ==Death== Hyatt died of cancer in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 64. ==Works== * Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation and Other Devices.
