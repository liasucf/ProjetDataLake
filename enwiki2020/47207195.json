    "text": "Vasile Pop (June 14, 1875 - 1931) was a Romanian prose writer. Born in Domne\u0219ti, Vrancea County, his parents were the farmers Ion Pop and Ecaterina (n\u00e9e Rare\u0219). After attending primary school, he worked as a mechanical laborer. An autodidact, he then became an English and gym teacher at the Constan\u021ba Naval Institute. He made his published debut in Munca newspaper in 1890, and headed Evenimentul from 1904 to 1905. His first book was the 1899 Fleacuri. His work appeared in S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul, F\u0103t-Frumos and Luceaf\u0103rul, and he sometimes signed as Acadin, Gh. Bradul, V. Fr., Gh. Scytul or Const. Fulger. He wrote one book of poor-quality poems, Versuri (1900). He authored the prose volumes Din ocna vie\u021bii (1902), R\u00e2s \u0219i pl\u00e2ns (1906), Pove\u0219ti hazlii (1908) and Din via\u021ba speluncelor (1923), while his novels included Domni\u021ba Viorica (1905), Americana \u00eendr\u0103gostit\u0103 (1920), Cuceritorul de inimi (1921) and V\u00e2ndut\u0103 de propria-i mam\u0103 (1922). Sensationalist in character, these were marked by melodramatic endings and a strikingly poor aesthetic taste.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. II, p. 388.
