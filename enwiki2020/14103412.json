    "text": "The gens Afrania was a plebeian family at Rome, which is first mentioned in the second century BC. The first member of this gens to achieve prominence was Gaius Afranius Stellio, who became praetor in 185 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 55 (\"Afrania Gens\"). ==Origin== The nomen Afranius belongs to a class of gentilicia derived from surnames ending in -anus, typically derived from place names.Chase, p. 118. The Afranii may have been of Picentine origin. Lucius Afranius, who held the consulship in 60 BC, was from Picenum, and a Titus Afranius or Afrenius was one of the leaders of the allies during the Social War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 55 (\"Titus Afranius or Titus Afrenius\", No. 8). ==Praenomina== The main praenomina used by the Afranii were Lucius, Publius, Gaius, Gnaeus and Sextus. There are also several occurrences of Marcus and Quintus, while other praenomina occur infrequently, with individual instances of Aulus, Spurius, and Titus. ==Branches and cognomina== The only cognomen of the Afranii in the time of the Republic is Stellio, referring to a spotted newt or lizard, perhaps with the implication that the bearer was crafty. Other surnames are found under the Empire.Chase, pp. 112, 113.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. stellio. ==Members== * Gaius Afranius Stellio, praetor in 185 BC, and triumvir for founding a colony in 183.Livy, xxxix. 23, 25.Broughton, vol.
