The project was launched after survey results had shown that years of frightening propaganda only had a short-term effect on the improvement of student's sexual health and that the numbers of sexually transmitted diseases among students was reaching extreme levels. The project P6 turned out to be successful; on three occasions during the 1990s, large studies were conducted which all showed a consistent positive effect. The project received a lot of attention internationally and several projects with P6 as a role model have been launched around the world until today, for example in India, China and Uganda. Around 2003, several similar projects were launched in Sweden and today there are more than 10 Swedish student organizations working with sexual health among students. In the fall of 2009, these organizations, with support from the already established organization P6, formed the national umbrella organization Students for Sexual Health (SfSH). Nowadays, P6 in Lund has around 700 members, of which 40-50 are active members, and keeps growing. == External links == *Projekt Sex - Official site == References == Category:Lund University Category:Sex education Category:Sexuality in Sweden ",
