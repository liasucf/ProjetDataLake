She was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize 2017 of the German Research Foundation. == Biography == Beatrice Gr\u00fcndler studied Arabic language and literature, Semitic Studies, and Assyriology at University of Strasbourg, France, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, und Harvard University, U.S.A, where she completed her doctorate in 1995 in Near Eastern Languages and Civilisations. After a visiting professorship at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, she taught from 1996 at Yale University, first as assistant professor and, since 2002, as full professor for Arabic literature. In the academic year 2010-2011 Gr\u00fcndler was Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study with the project The Islamic Age of Communication In 2014 she returned to Germany permanently, where she teaches and conducts research at Free University of Berlin. Gr\u00fcndler is Principal Investigator of the Friedrich Schlegel Graduate School of Literary Studies and the Berlin Graduate School Muslim Cultures and Societies. There she leads together with Dimitri Gutas, Professor of Graeco-Arabic Studies at Yale University and Einstein Visiting Fellow, the project Aristotle's Poetics in the West (of India) from Antiquity to the Renaissance. A Multilingual Edition with Studies of the Cultural Contexts of the Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin Translations funded by the Einstein Foundation. Gr\u00fcndler is member of the Board of Directors of the Dahlem Humanities Center at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. Since 2016 she is President of the American Oriental Society. == Research == Gr\u00fcndler\u2019s areas of research include classical Arabic literature and its social context, the integration of literary theory into the study of Near Eastern literatures, the history of the Arabic languages, Arabic paleography, the history of the Arabic book, and the connection between Arabic and other premodern literatures. Gr\u00fcndler understands Arabic as a cosmopolitan language: > In premodern times (i.e. from the seventh to the nineteenth century) Arabic > was a learned language, and it served as a medium for many writers of other > mother tongues, such as Iranians, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Visigoths, and > others. Arabic assembled the voices of individuals of various ethnic and > religious backgrounds. All of these formed part of the Arabic-Islamic > commonwealth. The German Research Foundation motivated the awarding of the Leibniz-Prize 2017 (the most important prize supporting research in Germany) to Gr\u00fcndler as follows: > Beatrice Gr\u00fcndler receives the Leibniz-Prize for her studies of the > polyphonic nature of Arabic poetry and culture. Early in her career she > devoted herself to the medium of script, recognizing its fundamental > importance for the Arabic tradition, notably with her book The Development > of the Arabic Script (1993). Based on her research, she finally developed a > complex history of the media of the Arab world, beginning with the > introduction of paper and extending to book printing and beyond. Gr\u00fcndler > speaks in this context of an \"Arabic book revolution.\" With her pilot > project of a critical digital and commented edition of Kalila wa-Dimna, > begun in 2015, Gr\u00fcndler is making accessible the genesis, textual history, > and reception of one of the earliest Arabic prose texts and a central work > of Arabic wisdom literature. In her work, Gr\u00fcndler practices herself in a > model way the encounter of the Arabic and European traditions of knowledge > which she investigates, and this makes her research all the more > significant. == Publications == === As Author === The Life and Times of Ab\u016b Tamm\u0101m by Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b preceded by al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b\u2019s Epistle to Ab\u016b l-Layth Muz\u0101\u1e25im ibn F\u0101tik, edition and translation, Library of Arabic Literature.
