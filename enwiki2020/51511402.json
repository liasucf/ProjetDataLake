Weinles studied at Wojciech Gerson's art class, and at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw in the 1890s. He completed art workshops with Szymon Hollosy in Munich. In 1898, he returned to Warsaw where he painted with other Jewish painters. His wife was \u0141ucja from the House of Kaufman, with whom he had two daughters: Franciszka Themerson, also a painter and Maria Chajnik. He is buried at the Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw; however, his headstone has not survived.
