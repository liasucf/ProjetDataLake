    "text": "Square is a studio album by Canadian hip hop musician Buck 65. It was released on WEA in 2002. Although it consists of four tracks, each track consists of multiple songs. The album was nominated for the 2003 Juno Awards for Alternative Album of the Year and Album Design of the Year. ==Critical reception== Rollie Pemberton of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.0 out of 10, describing it as \"a melodic mix of folk rock sensibility, smooth early 90s style production, clever lyrical observations and a relatively enjoyable train ride into the mental station of Halifax's best-known emcee.\" Meanwhile, Clay Jarvis of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of B+, saying, \"Square is built solely out of his strengths: hazy introspection, sparse snare-and-kick beats and simple, dismal instrumental refrains.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Buck 65 \u2013 words, beats, scratches * Greymatter \u2013 helping hands * Charles Austin \u2013 helping hands * DJ Signify \u2013 helping hands * Jorun \u2013 helping hands * Yan \u2013 helping hands * James Paterson \u2013 cover art, design * Robbie Cameron \u2013 cover art, design ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2002 albums Category:Buck 65 albums Category:Warner Music Group albums ",
