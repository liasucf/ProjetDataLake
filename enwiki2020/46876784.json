He was born at Highbury, Middlesex, England and he was educated at Giggleswick School, Settle, North Yorkshireref: 1891 England Census, Yorkshire, Giggleswick District, Giggleswick Royal Grammar School. == Change of Name == In November 1914, Teschemacher announcedBuckinghamshire Examiner - Friday 13 November 1914 \"Mr Edward Teschemacher Takes Name of Lockton\" that from 13 November, he wished to be known and addressed as Edward Frederick Lockton\"Mr Edward Teschmacher begs to announce that he has changed his surname to Lockton. Mr Lockton, as his friends and aquaintances know, is an Englishman. He was born in London as were his father and grandfather, the last named in 1791. He therefore thinks it undesirable, and perhaps misleading, to continue to bear a foreign name and desires all communication to be addressed to him in the future under the name of Lockton. It may be mentioned that the name Mr. Teeschmacher has now taken is that of his mother. His father, who as is stated was born in London, went to school with the late Mr. Joseph Chamerlain at Highbury. Mr. Lockton has no relatives in Germany; nor had his father any German relatives\". == Other Work == Beside his work as a song lyricist, he also worked as a translator, arranger, librettist responsible for writing or co-writing a number of well-known pieces, including \"Because\" (music composed by Guy d'Hardelot) (1902) and \"I'll Walk Beside You\" (music composed by Alan Murray) (1939). Teschemacher wrote much of his lyrics for popular music between 1900 and the late 1920s. His work as a translator includes translating \"Mattinata\" (music by Leoncavallo) from Italian to English (new title \"Tis the Day\") in 1904, translating a series of folksongs from Norwegian and Danish to English in 1906, and translating the \"Mariae Wiegenlied\" (The Virgin's Slumber Song) from German to English in 1917. == Lyrical works published as Edward Teschemacher == *\"Farewell to Summer\" \u2013 1900 *\"Because\" \u2013 1902 *\"The Little Irish Girl\" \u2013 1903 *\"I Know a Lovely Garden\" \u2013 1903 *\"Mattinata\" \u2013 1904 (translated from Italian) *\"Songs of the Norseland\" \u2013 1906(a collection of Danish and Norwegian folk songs translated by Teschemacher, with music by Hermann L\u00f6hr) *\"Tommy Lad!\" \u2013 1907 *\"Romany Songs\" \u2013 1909 (a collection of songs with music by Hermann L\u00f6hr and lyrics by Teschemacher and Arthur Cleveland) *\"Until\" \u2013 1910 *\"Where My Caravan Has Rested\" \u2013 1910 *\"Your Heart Will Call Me Home\" \u2013 1912 *\"Sweetest Rose That Ever Bloomed\" \u2013 1912 *\"What Would the Roses Say?\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Bells of Burmali\" (from Songs of the Orient) \u2013 1912 *\"Eyes That Used to Gaze in Mine\" \u2013 1912 *\"Those Sad Blue Eyes\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Voyagers\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Call of the Homeland\" \u2013 1912 *\"Life and Love\" \u2013 1912 *\"Lily of My Heart\" \u2013 1912 *\"Rose of Mine\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Clasp of a Hand\" \u2013 1912 *\"I Looked Into Your Heart\" \u2013 1912 *\"Absence\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Dawn\" \u2013 1912 *\"The Little Shawl of Blue\" \u2013 1913 *\"Trusting Eyes\" \u2013 1913 *\"Shipmates O' Mine\" \u2013 1913 *\"Serenade Espagnole\" \u2013 1914 *\"Night and Dawn\" \u2013 1914 *\"I Wonder If Love Is a Dream\" \u2013 1914 *\"Stars That Light My Garden\" \u2013 1915 *\"Go For A Soldier\" \u2013 1915 *\"Golden Bird\" \u2013 1915 *\"Out of the Silence\" \u2013 1915 *\"Come and See the Roses\" \u2013 1915 *\"Those Eyes of Blue\" \u2013 1915 *\"The Blackbird Sings to You\" \u2013 1915 *\"Fairies from the Moon\" \u2013 1915 *\"O Flower Divine\" \u2013 1915 *\"Love's Silent Song\" \u2013 1915 *\"Oh May My Dreams Come True\" \u2013 1915 *\"Your Voice\" \u2013 1915 *\"Come to Me, Morna\" \u2013 1915 *\"God's Beautiful Valley\" \u2013 1915 *\"This Rose of Mine\" \u2013 1915 *\"Dear Little Girl Named You\" \u2013 1915 *\"Fairlie/Mable Browning\" \u2013 1915 (words by Teschemacher and E.W.
