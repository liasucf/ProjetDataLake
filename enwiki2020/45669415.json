    "text": "Vishuddhananda Paramahansa (14 March 1853 \u2013 14 July 1937) popularly known as Gandha Baba (\"Perfume Saint\") was a Hindu yogi and saint. By the early 1900s, he had developed yogic powers such as the materalization of objects and scents, and became socially popular for his feats. His encounter with Paramhansa Yogananda, during the latter's youth, is detailed in Yogananda's autobiography. He was born as Bholanath Chattopadhaya to Akhil Chandra Chattopadhaya and Raj Rajeshswari Chattopadhaya in a village named Bondul in the current Bardhaman district in West Bengal, India. Vishuddhanand Paramhamsa was a Saint who had a scientific & rational mindset along with devotional qualities. He was dedicated to his Guru & never disobeyed Guru's instruction. His spiritual training school was Gyanganj in Tibet. He attained the sadhana of Navmundi asana (Varanasi) which is the highest realisation on the Sakti path. He is the only saint who made ever unbelievable spiritual output. Vishuddhanand Paramhamsa had almost infinite siddhis but never focused them in public. He disliked too much of public life.His solitude was his dedication to the Divine. Many people would get cured of diseases with just a blessing from Vishuddhanand Paramhamsa. He wished to offer the world a meditation centre based on celestial Solar Science and propagated with endeavor but later on he had to stop because of the unwillingness of His elder Guru Brothers. Dr. Gopinath Kaviraj and Akshay Kumar Dutta Gupta were most known disciples of Him. 'Karmebhyoh Namah' is the major message by Him. (doing Yogic Kriya with mantra as initiated by Guru will lead to divine knowledge further yielding in divine bhakti & would finally result in divine love). == References == Category:1853 births Category:1937 deaths Category:19th- century Hindu religious leaders Category:Bengali people Category:Bengali Hindus Category:Hindu philosophers Category:Indian Hindu spiritual teachers Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders Category:Indian yogis Category:Indian Hindu monks Category:Tantra Category:Spiritual practice Category:Hindu saints ",
