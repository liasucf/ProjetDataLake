    "text": "The Inbetweeners, also referred to as The Inbetweeners USA and The American Inbetweeners, is an American television sitcom developed by Brad Copeland for MTV. The show stars Joey Pollari, Bubba Lewis, Mark L. Young, Zack Pearlman, Alex Frnka and Brett Gelman. The show is a remake of the original UK series of the same name written and created by Damon Beesley and Iain Morris, who served as executive producers alongside Copeland, Aaron Kaplan and Lauren Corra. It ran on MTV from August 20, to November 5, 2012. On November 28, 2012, the series was canceled after one season, due to poor ratings and reviews. ==Main cast== * Joey Pollari as Will McKenzie * Bubba Lewis as Simon Cooper * Alex Frnka as Carli D'Amato * Zack Pearlman as Jay Cartwright * Mark L. Young as Neil Sutherland ==Production== After an unsuccessful attempt by ABC to create an American version of The Inbetweeners in 2008, MTV announced in late September 2010 that it had hired noted comedy writer Brad Copeland (known for writing on American comedies such as Arrested Development and My Name Is Earl) to write the script for an American Inbetweeners series. Taika Waititi was chosen to direct the pilot. On March 31, 2011, MTV officially announced that it had picked up The Inbetweeners for an additional eleven episodes, creating a twelve-episode first season. Copeland served as executive producer and showrunner. Late November 2012 brought the news that MTV had decided not to go forward with a second season of the series. MTV said to The Wrap, \"While we won't be moving forward with another season of The Inbetweeners, we enjoyed working with the show's creators and such a talented, funny cast.\" The American version is extremely unpopular with viewers from the UK, with many newspapers reporting that it had 'flopped'. It was listed by Metro as one of the 'Top 10 English comedies whose US remakes have flopped'. == Episodes == ==Critical reception== The series was panned by critics. However, on Metacritic the series has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \u2018generally favourable reviews\u2019. ==Film adaptation== On July 3, 2012, it was announced that a U.S. adaptation of The Inbetweeners Movie is to be made. Morris and Beesley were approached by Paramount Pictures to lead the project. It is unknown if the film will still be made after the cancellation of the series itself. On August 22, 2013, Jim Field Smith has been revealed to be directing the American adaptation of the British film, now titled Virgins America. Whether Morris and Beesley have involvement with the project is unknown. == References == == External links == * * * Kiwi Taika Waititi directing The Inbetweeners US pilot Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:2010s American high school television series Category:2010s American sex comedy television series Category:2010s American single-camera sitcoms Category:2010s American teen sitcoms Category:American television series based on British television series Category:English-language television shows Category:MTV original programming Category:Television series about suburbia Category:Television series about teenagers Category:Television shows set in Florida Category:The Inbetweeners ",
