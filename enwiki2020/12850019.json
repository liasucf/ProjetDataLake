From 1979\u20131980 he was Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Vienna and from 1983\u201384 consultant to UNIDO. He was a visiting lecturer (1986\u201389) at the University of Klagenfurt and then Visiting Fellow of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex. He spent 1990\u201393 as Honorary Research Fellow, Department of Commerce, University of Birmingham and in 1998 participated in the UNDP's research project \"International Development Cooperation and Global Public Goods\". Since 2002 he has been Senior Associate of the New Economics Foundation (London), with a winter term (002-03) as visiting Professor at the Centre for the Study of International Institutions (CSI), SOWI Faculty, University of Innsbruck. His articles on Chapter 11 of US Title 11 (Bankruptcy) in the context of the problem of sovereignty created a veritable flood of international reactions. In 1987 Raffer proposed to internationalise the basic features of the US Chapter 9, maintaining that its essential points can be applied to sovereign borrowers immediately and without problems. There were numerous academic responses.Eichengreen, Barry (1999) Toward a New International Financial Architecture: A Practical Post-Asia Agenda, Institute for International Economics: Washington DCRogoff, Kenneth (1999) \"Global Financial Instability: Framework, Events, Issues\", The Journal of Economic Perspectives 13(4), pp.21ffDabrowski, Martin , Rolf Eschenburg & Karl Gabriel (Hg) (2000) L\u00f6sungsstrategien zur \u00dcberwindung der Internationalen Schuldenkrise (Volkswirtschaftliche Schriften, Heft 509), Duncker & Humblot: BerlinRogoff, Kenneth & Jeromin Zettelmeyer (2002) \"Bankruptcy Procedures for Sovereigns: A History of Ideas, 1976\u20132001\", IMF Staff Papers 49(3), pp.470ffMartin Dabrowski, Andreas Fisch, Karl Gabriel & Christoph Lienkamp (Hg) (2003) Die Diskussion um ein Insolvenzrecht f\u00fcr Staaten, Bewertungen eines L\u00f6sungsvorschlages zur \u00dcberwindung der Internationalen Schuldenkrise, Duncker & Humblot, BerlinP.K.

In the US, Raffer's proposal was incorporated into the \"Global Development Resolution\", initiated by Rep. Bernie Sanders (for the 106th Congress, 1st Session). Other legislative assemblies, reciting to Raffer's proposals, were the Argentine Parliament in Buenos Aires, the Uruguayan Parliament (Palacio Legislativo), and the Indonesian Parliament in Jakarta. On 18 March 1999, Raffer was invited to present his ideas at a consultative meeting between the international Jubilee 2000 campaign, representatives of the G-7 governments and the Bretton Woods institutions on developing countries' debts in London. ==Major publications== * The economic north\u2013south divide six decades of unequal development.
