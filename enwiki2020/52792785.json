In the Mud Whale, society is divided into two kinds of people: the Marked, who can move objects with their minds using a strange power called \"thymia\", at the expense of shortened lifespans, and the Unmarked, people who lack thymia but enjoy longer lifespans. Chakuro and his friends have never seen anyone from the outside world, and they spend their days yearning to explore and learn about it. In year 93 of the vessel's exile, the Mud Whale encounters a lonely island and Chakuro finds a girl inside, starting an adventure that changes the lives of everyone. ==Characters== ; : :The protagonist of the story.

She is at first reluctant to speak to anyone, but with Chakuro's help she learns to express herself more openly. ; : :Another Marked one who is said to possess the greatest potential for thymia in the Mud Whale. He is the leader of the Moles, a group of young people who gained their name because they often break the rules of the Mud Whale and thus spent a lot of time imprisoned in the belly of the ship.

He is Chakuro's friend and Sami's elder brother, he often gives them advice for how they can help the Mud Whale's people.
