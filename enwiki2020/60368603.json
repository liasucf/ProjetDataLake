    "text": "The Mountain Environment is a 1983 role-playing game supplement for Traveller published by Gamelords. ==Contents== The Mountain Environment is a book that details using mountainous terrain as a setting for adventure scenarios. ==Reception== Stephen Nutt reviewed The Mountain Environment for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"How many times will your Travellers have to scale a mountain face? The only times I have been able to use this are in crash situations or when small climbs are needed, usually skulking around doing a dirty deed. Apart from that one scenario where the players climb a mountain for fun, I don't think I shall ever use the full mountaineering rules.\" Tony Watson reviewed The Mountain Environment and The Undersea Environment together in The Space Gamer No. 72. Watson commented that \"The tight focus and elaborate detail of these supplements is both their strength and weakness. Just about all aspects of mountain and undersea environments are covered, but I wonder just how much of this material is really going to make its way into the average adventure.\" ==Reviews== * Different Worlds #40 (July/Aug., 1985) *Dragon #133 ==References== Category:Traveller (role-playing game) supplements ",
