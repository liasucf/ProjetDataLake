It holds an average score of 8.51/10 based on 23 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads \"Silicon Valley re-ups its comedy quotient with an episode that smooths out the rough edges left behind by the loss of a beloved cast member.\" Similarly, on Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, holds a score of 86 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly, who gave the season an A rating, described it as \"smart and snide\", saying that \"the show's actors imbue their geeky cut-outs with winsomely flawed humanity that allows us to care about them even as they undercut each other and themselves in their pursuit of success and significance. Pied Piper may never reach greatness, but Silicon Valley seems ready to.\" For The Hollywood Reporter, Tim Goodman praised the season as \"impressively upgraded after a stellar first season.\" One focus for critics was the show's replacement for Christopher Evan Welch, who died during the production of season 1. In Vulture, Matt Zoller Seitz praised Welch's replacement, Suzanne Cryer, saying \"both the character and the actress are excellent \u2013 at once reassuringly familiar and off-putting in ways that don't register right away.\" Less enthusiastic, Brian Tallerico on RogerEbert.com described Cryer's character Laurie Bream as a \"fill-in character\". === Accolades === For the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, the series was nominated for Best Series (Musical or Comedy).
