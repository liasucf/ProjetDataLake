They retained their predominantly black home jerseys from 2010, but instead only was near fully black (Faint claw marks on either sides) with only teal on the collar and sleeves. The teal jersey of last year was to be used as the away jersey again, but was dumped in Round 4, for a white jersey with teal and black stripes and the same claw marks from the home jersey. The heritage jersey used was from their 1991 jersey. The \"Pink Panthers\" jersey used was based on the new away jersey, except absolutely everything on the jersey was made of different shades of pink. Sanyo were again the major sponsor of the Panthers in 2011. Titan Warehousing Solutions were dropped as the sleeve sponsor with the club opting to go with no sponsor at all, until 17 April, when the club announced that Onsite Cleaning would be the 2011 sleeve sponsor. == Fixtures == The Panthers again used Centrebet Stadium as their home ground in 2011, their home ground since they entered the competition in 1967. ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:75%;\" width=\"100%\" !Date!!
