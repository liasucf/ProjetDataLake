A member of the The Republicans, he has been Mayor of the 15th arrondissement of Paris since 2008. ==Career== Goujon first replaced \u00c9douard Balladur in the National Assembly in 1993 upon his appointment as Prime Minister of France. A member of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) until 2002, he was elected to the Senate in the 2004 election for the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), before returning to the National Assembly for two full terms after Balladur's retirement from politics in 2007. Goujon was defeated in the 2017 legislative election by Olivia Gr\u00e9goire, running for La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM). Elected Mayor of the 15th arrondissement of Paris in the 2008 municipal election and reelected in 2014, he lost his party's renomination in 2020 to Agn\u00e8s Evren. Although she beat him in the first round of the election after he chose to run nevertheless as an Independent with the support of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) and Agir, they both advanced to the second round before a policy agreement was reached which would let Goujon remain in office for a third term while Evren would withdraw her candidacy and continue as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV alumni Category:Sciences Po alumni Category:Politicians from Paris Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 14th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Senators of Paris Category:Mayors of an arrondissement of Paris ",
