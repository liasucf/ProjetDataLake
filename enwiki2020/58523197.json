The Hasura GraphQL Engine provides GraphQL APIs over new or existing Postgres databases. The Hasura Kubernetes Platform is a managed platform for building, deploying, and managing applications on Kubernetes. The company was founded on 2017, and has its headquarters in San Francisco and Bangalore. ==History== Prior to founding Hasura, founders Tanmai Gopal and Rajoshi Ghosh started an online food delivery platform. While building the platform, they realised that there were questions of what stack and which programmes to use. They found that they were solving some core issues like getting a C library to communicate with a Python library and integrate the best that is available, while checking app performance. This is how their startup gradually transitioned from a food delivery platform, to building tools for developers. The technology created for the platform was a database platform that combined the use of a NoSQL API with transaction management, called \"Procrust.es.\" as a toolkit to be used by developers. The toolkit evolved into the Hasura platform, which was introduced in February 2017. In 2017, the company started a free online course (MOOC) called Introduction to Modern Application Development (IMAD), in partnership with IIT Madras. In April 2018, the company announced that it has raised $1.6 million seed capital from Nexus Venture Partners and GREE Ventures. Hasura became a certified vendor of the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program, which was created by The Cloud Native Computing Foundation 2018. In July 2018, the company announced the open source release of the Hasura GraphQL Engine to enable developers to set up GraphQL endpoints on their existing postgres applications. In September 2018, the company introduced an open source event trigger system on Postgres for building serverless apps. ==Products== ===Hasura GraphQL Engine=== The Hasura GraphQL Engine provides developers with GraphQL APIs for Postgres applications.
