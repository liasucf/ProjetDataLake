    "text": "is a Japanese manga which spawned a popular live-action TV drama, starring Yumiko Shaku, and 2003 theatrical release starring the same actress in a big budget prequel to the TV series. The manga was written by Japanese manga author Tsutomu Takahashi. Published in December 2001, the 240 page graphic novel follows the story of Izuko, a beautiful and mysterious \"Guardian of the Gate\" to the Afterlife. Izuku guides troubled souls who pass through, presenting them with three choices: to ascend to Heaven to await reincarnation; to deny their death and wander the earth as a ghost, or to seek vengeance upon the person who caused their death or suffering\u2014but the consequences of that, no matter how justified, is to be condemned to Hell. Sequels include and . Both sequels were published while the series was in production and at the height of its popularity. ==Plot== Izuko (Yumiko Shaku) is a beautiful and mysterious gatekeeper to the afterlife. Known as the Guardian of the Gate, Izuko guides spirits of the recently departed on their journey...sometimes to Heaven, other times to Hell. The decision is theirs and it is not always an easy one. Often the spirit is the victim of a murder or other untimely death. In such case, a soul is offered three options: 1) accept their death as it is and proceed into Heaven to await reincarnation. 2) Wander the Earth as a ghost. 3) Take justice into their own hands and face the gates of Hell. Most episodes (see Episode List below) involve the guest starring character seeking to discover what happened to them and why\u2014with Izuko attempting to guide them on the correct path. To her sadness and despite her compassion, Izuko does not always succeed and the moral dilemma is often very grey and unfair. ==References== == External links == * Category:2001 manga Category:2003 Japanese television series debuts Category:2003 films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese drama television series Category:Manga adapted into films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Shueisha franchises Category:Shueisha manga Category:Seinen manga Category:TV Asahi original programming Category:Films with screenplays by Takeharu Sakurai ",
