Durand. ==Distribution== Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. ==Description== Its long-stalked medium-green leaves are spear-shaped and may grow to about 40 cm in length. It grows in muddy areas near, or in streams, sometimes even completely submerged. ==Cultivation== This plant grows best when only partially submersed and when not crowded by other plants. It requires a lot of nutrients, a loose, iron-rich substrate, and moderate-to- strong light. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 degrees C (72-79 degrees F). It can be propagated by dividing the rhizome or by its seed. ==References== gilletii Category:Aquatic plants Category:Flora of Nigeria Category:Flora of West-Central Tropical Africa Category:Plants described in 1901 ",
