    "text": "Imperial Korean Army The Imperial Armed Forces (\ub300\ud55c\uc81c\uad6d\uad70) was the military of the Korean Empire. ==Composition== It was composed of the Imperial Korean Army, the Imperial Korean Navy, and the Imperial Guards. ==Organization== Succeeding the old royal Army of Joseon, the Gwangmu Reform reorganized the military to a modern Western-style military. Unlike in the Joseon Dynasty, service was voluntary. ==Dissolution== The Army was disbanded on August 1, 1907, as a consequence of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1907. Colonel Park Seung-hwan protested by committing suicide. This sparked a revolt led by former imperial soldiers leading to the battle at Namdaemun Gate. The remaining soldiers were later incorporated as Emperor Sunjong's Royal Guards, which continued even after the annexation in 1910. ==References== Category:Korean Empire Category:History of Korea Category:Military history of Korea ",
