    "text": "\"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\" is a song by Elton Motello about a 15-year-old boy's sexual relationship with an older man, who then rejects him for a girl. ==Composition== \"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\" has the same backing track as Plastic Bertrand/Lou Deprijck's \"\u00c7a plane pour moi\". A few months before the vocals for \"\u00c7a plane pour moi\" were recorded, the record firm used the same backing track with the same musicians to release \"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\". Alan Ward recorded his song in English. ==Lyrics and controversy== In 1989, the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC), acting on a complaint from activist Jack Thompson fined radio station WIOD $10,000 for allowing talk host Neil Rogers to play the song. Thompson considered the song obscene and the FCC agreed with him. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1978) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|33 |} ==Personnel== ;Elton Motello * Alan Ward/Alan Timms \u2013 vocals * Jet Staxx/Mike Butcher \u2013 guitar * John Valke \u2013 bass * Bob Dartch \u2013 drums ==Cover versions== The song has been covered by numerous bands, including The Damned, FIDLAR, Captain Sensible & the Softies, Chron Gen, the Bamboo Kids, the pUKEs, and Crocodiles.
