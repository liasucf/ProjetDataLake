    "text": "The 2017 European Tour was the ninth edition of the Race to Dubai and the 46th season of golf tournaments since the European Tour officially began in 1972. England's Tommy Fleetwood won the Race to Dubai. Spanish golfers collected the annual awards; Golfer of the Year was Sergio Garc\u00eda, who won his first major, and Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year was Jon Rahm ==Changes for 2017== For the 2017 season, the European Tour created the \"Rolex Series\", a group of selected tournaments with a minimum purse of US$7 million. Seven tournaments were initially announced: the BMW PGA Championship, the Irish Open, the Scottish Open, the Italian Open and the three Final Series events \u2013 the Turkish Airlines Open, the Nedbank Golf Challenge and the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai. The Open de France was later announced as the eighth Rolex Series event. There were changes to membership criteria with the creation of a new \"Access List\", a season-long money list excluding the Masters Tournament, PGA Championship, the four World Golf Championships and the Rolex Series events. The top three players in the Access List standings would be invited to play in Rolex Series events, and the top 10 players in the Access List final standings not otherwise exempt would gain full European Tour membership for the following season. There was a corresponding reduction in numbers from the Race to Dubai final standings gaining cards, down from the top 110 to the top 100. === Tournament changes === *New tournaments: GolfSixes. *Returning tournaments (not part of the 2016 season): Hong Kong Open, Sicilian Open, Andaluc\u00eda Masters, Open de Portugal. *No longer part of the schedule: True Thailand Classic, King's Cup, AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open (due to date change from May to December; returned for the 2018 season). *Format change: the Perth International became the World Super 6 Perth, with the top-24 players after 54-hole stroke play competing in a 6-hole knockout match play tournament on the final day. ==Schedule== The table below shows the 2017 European Tour schedule which begins with two events in late 2016. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" !Date !Tournament !Host country !Winner !OWGR points !Notes |- |4 Dec |Australian PGA Championship |Australia | Harold Varner III (1) |align=center|22 |Co-sanctioned with the PGA Tour of Australasia |- |4 Dec |Alfred Dunhill Championship |South Africa | Brandon Stone (2) |align=center|32 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |11 Dec |UBS Hong Kong Open |Hong Kong | Sam Brazel (1) |align=center|32 |Co- sanctioned with the Asian Tour |- |15 Jan |BMW SA Open |South Africa | Graeme Storm (2) |align=center|26 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |22 Jan |Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship |United Arab Emirates | Tommy Fleetwood (2) |align=center|50 | |- |29 Jan |Commercial Bank Qatar Masters |Qatar | Wang Jeung-hun (3) |align=center|32 | |- |5 Feb |Omega Dubai Desert Classic |United Arab Emirates | Sergio Garc\u00eda (12) |align=center|46 | |- |12 Feb |Maybank Championship |Malaysia | Fabrizio Zanotti (2) |align=center|36 |Co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour |- |19 Feb |ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth |Australia | Brett Rumford (6) |align=center|23 |Co-sanctioned with the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Asian Tour |- |26 Feb |Joburg Open |South Africa | Darren Fichardt (5) |align=center|19 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |-style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\" |5 Mar |WGC-Mexico Championship |Mexico | Dustin Johnson (n/a) |align=center|76 |World Golf Championships |- |5 Mar |Tshwane Open |South Africa | Dean Burmester (1) |align=center|19 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |12 Mar |Hero Indian Open |India | Shiv Chawrasia (4) |align=center|21 |Co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour |-style=\"background:#dfe2e9;\" |26 Mar |WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play |United States | Dustin Johnson (n/a) |align=center|74 |World Golf Championships |- style=\"background:#e5d1cb;\" |9 Apr |Masters Tournament |United States | Sergio Garc\u00eda (13) |align=center|100 |Major championship |- |16 Apr |Troph\u00e9e Hassan II |Morocco | Edoardo Molinari (3) |align=center|24 | |- |23 Apr |Shenzhen International |China | Bernd Wiesberger (4) |align=center|26 | |- |30 Apr |Volvo China Open |China | Alexander L\u00e9vy (4) |align=center|24 |Co-sanctioned with OneAsia |- |7 May |GolfSixes |England | |align=center|n/a |New tournament;
