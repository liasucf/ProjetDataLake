The Golden Knights entered the season following their second Frozen Four appearance the previous season. After a slow start, the Golden Knights rebounded to win their third ECAC Regular Season title in four years. They followed this with their first ever ECAC tournament championship, defeating Cornell by a score of 1\u20130. In the NCAA Tournament, the Golden Knights advanced to their second title game, which they won 3\u20130 over top-ranked Wisconsin for the program's second national title. In addition to the postseason championships, the Golden Knights also won an in-season tournament for the first time, winning the Windjammer Classic at Vermont on Thanksgiving weekend. ==Offseason== ===Coaching changes=== The offseason saw the departure of two- year assistant coach Meghan Duggan, who left to concentrate on preparing for the Winter Olympics in two years time. Her role was filled by Tony Maci, who had previously served as an assistant coach at Adrian College and Princeton. ===Recruiting=== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"\" | Player || Position ||Nationality || Notes |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \" | Jenna Brenneman || Goaltender || || Played for Breck School |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \" | Katherine Beaumier || Forward || || Played for Anaheim Lady Ducks |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \" | Michaela Pejzlova || Forward || || Played for Stanstead College Member of Czech Republic team at the 2016 IIHF Women's World Championship |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \" | Ella Shelton || Defense || || Played for London Jr. Devilettes Member of 2016 U18 Team Ontario |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \" | Taylor Turnquist || Defense || || Played for Spring Lake Park High School |} ==Roster== ==Schedule== |- !colspan=12 style=\"\"| Regular Season |- !colspan=12 style=\"\"| ECAC Hockey Tournament |- !colspan=12 style=\"\"| NCAA Tournament ==Awards and honors== * Genevieve Bannon \u2013 NCAA All-Tournament Team, Second Team All-USCHO.com, ECAC Hockey Second Team All-Star, ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/1, 11/22, 1/24, 2/6) * Loren Gabel \u2013 ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team, ECAC Hockey Player of the Week (3/5), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/7, 2/14) * Savannah Harmon \u2013 NCAA All-Tournament Team, Second Team AHCA All- American, Second Team All-USCHO.com, Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award nominee, ECAC Hockey First Team All-Star, ECAC Hockey Player of the Year finalist, ECAC Hockey Best Defenseman, ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (10/25) * Corie Jacobson \u2013 ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (10/11) * McKenzie Johnson \u2013 ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Week (12/13), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/15, 1/17) * Ryhen McGill \u2013 ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team, ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/15) * Cayley Mercer \u2013 Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award finalist, USCHO.com Player of the Year, NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, NCAA All- Tournament Team, First Team AHCA All-American, First Team All-USCHO.com, ECAC Hockey Player of the Year, ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team, ECAC Hockey First Team All-Star, ECAC Hockey Best Forward, ECAC Hockey Player of the Month (February, March), ECAC Hockey Player of the Week (12/5, 1/31, 2/21), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (12/13, 1/24) * Michaela Pejzlova \u2013 ECAC Hockey All- Rookie Team, ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week (11/7, 11/15), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (10/25, 11/1, 11/22, 1/17, 2/21), Windjammer Classic All-Tournament Team * Ella Shelton \u2013 USCHO.com All-Rookie Team, ECAC Hockey All-Tournament Team, ECAC Hockey Third Team All-Star, ECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team, ECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team, ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Month (December, March), ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week (3/5), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (12/6, 12/13, 1/31, 2/6, 2/14) * Shea Tiley \u2013 Second Team All-USCHO.com, ECAC Hockey Tournament Most Outstanding Player, ECAC Hockey Third Team All-Star, ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Year finalist, ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Month (February, March), ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Week (2/14, 3/5), ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (10/25, 11/1, 11/22, 11/29, 12/6, 1/31, 2/6, 2/21) * Taylor Turnquist \u2013 ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/29) * Cassidy Vinkle \u2013 ECAC Hockey weekly Honor Roll (11/29, 1/17), Windjammer Classic Most Valuable Player, Windjammer Classic All-Tournament Team ==References== Clarkson Category:Clarkson Golden Knights women's ice hockey seasons Category:NCAA women's ice hockey Frozen Four seasons Category:NCAA women's ice hockey championship seasons ",
