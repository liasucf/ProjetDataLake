    "text": "\"Turn It into Love\" is a single released by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was taken from her debut album Kylie. The single was released in December 1988 in Japan only. The B-side was a new song \"Made in Heaven\", which also served as the B-side to both \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" and \"It's No Secret\" in other international territories. \"Turn It into Love\" was the sixth single to be released from the album Kylie and was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. Considered something of a hidden gem, Kylie performed the song (as part of medleys) during her On a Night Like This Tour and Showgirl Homecoming shows in the 2000s, as well the Mushroom Records 25th birthday concert in Melbourne, Australia in 1998. Also a favourite track among Stock Aitken Waterman enthusiasts, the song also featured on the 2005 UK compilation album Stock Aitken Waterman Gold, one of just two tracks included that were not released as a single in the UK. ==Format and track listing== This is the format and track listing of major single release of \"Turn It into Love\".

As explained in notes contained on her 2012 greatest hits compilation, Evergreen, Hazell was at PWL studios recording \"Maybe\" when she was played a selection of songs being recorded for Kylie's debut album. \"Turn it into Love\" stood out, and she liked the song so much, she asked Pete Waterman to let her record her own version of the song. Waterman obliged and it was eventually released as the lead into the release of Dean's second Stock Aitken Waterman-produced album Always in October 1988. Dean's version of \"Turn It into Love\" went on to peak at number 21 in the UK singles chart the same month. Hazell believed it should have been released as the follow-up to \"Who's Leaving Who\" and felt it would have been a bigger hit. She also stated recently in an interview published on her website that it is her least favourite song to perform live. ==Same Difference version== Brother- sister duo Same Difference recorded \"Turn It into Love\" and included it on their debut album which was released on 1 December 2008. It was intended to have been the second single from the duo (and from the album), and was due for release in 2009 but was cancelled. In 1990, Hong Kong band Echo covered this song in Cantonese. ==\"Ai ga Tomaranai (Turn It into Love)\"== \"\u611b\u304c\u6b62\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044 (Turn It into Love)\" (\"Ai ga Tomaranai (Turn It into Love)\") was Wink's third single and is taken from the album \"At Heel Diamonds\". The song is a Japanese- language cover version of Kylie Minogue's \"Turn It into Love\", which had been released as a single only in Japan. Songwriter Neko Oikawa wrote the lyrics. The cover was issued on 16 November 1988 on CD (catalog number H10R-30011) and cassette tape (catalog number X10R-1021). It reached number one on the Oricon pop charts, and served as the theme song for the Japanese TV drama Oikaketai no! \"Ai ga Tomaranai\" itself has been covered by numerous artists. ===Track listing=== # \"\u611b\u304c\u6b62\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044 (Turn It into Love)\" / \"Ai ga Tomaranai (Turn It into Love)\" # \"Ding Ding: \u604b\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u307e\u308b\u3075\u305f\u308a\u306e\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\" / \"Ding Ding: Koikara Hajimaru Futarino Train\" ==Cover versions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
