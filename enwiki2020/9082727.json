The game was revived by the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations beginning in 2015 as one of a series of nine regionally themed bowl games held as part of an annual Ontario football bowl game festival since 2015. Rather than a strictly Toronto-area championship, the Metro Bowl is now held between one of either the Toronto District College Athletic Association (TDCAA) representing Catholic schools or the Toronto District Secondary School Athletic Association (TDSSAA) representing public schools, alternating each year, against another Ontario association's champion determined by draw. The Toronto association not playing in the Metro Bowl in a particular year will instead play in one of the other bowl games. The game has been held annually during the later part of November or early December at a venue in or in close proximity to the City of Toronto. Schools with multiple titles are: St. Michael's College School, Toronto (7); Richview Collegiate Institute, Toronto (3); Central Technical School, Toronto 2; Nelson High School, Burlington (2); Northern Secondary School (Toronto) (2); St. Patrick's Catholic High School, Sarnia (2) Woburn Collegiate Institute, Toronto (2) == Results == === 2016 === CHAMPION: St. Matthew High School Michael Power/St. Joseph High School (7) \u2013 St. Matthew High School (28) Championship (TDCAA vs NCSSAA) (TDSSAA champion to play in Northern Bowl) === 2015 === Championship (TDSSAA vs CWOSSA): Resurrection Catholic Secondary School Phoenix (CWOSSA) 31, Etobicoke Collegiate Institute Rams (TDSSAA) 8, played December 2nd.
