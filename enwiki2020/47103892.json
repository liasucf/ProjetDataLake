Blade is ready to go to any extent for the sake of Naaga. However, Naaga views Blade just as a henchman and uses him to run his local mafia. Vithya (Nayanthara) is the daughter of a local factory owner (Joe Malloori) who is also a friend of Naaga. She falls for Ganesh after he saves her from a few goons. Vithya's father arranges her wedding with another man, but everyone learns about the love affair between Vithya and Blade, which creates animosity between Naaga and Vithya's father. Naaga does not want Blade to marry anyone as he fears that Blade might leave him post marriage which could weaken his mafia business. Blade overhears Naaga's conversation and understands his true intentions and feels bad for blindly trusting Naaga all these days leading to his transformation into a good human being. Vithya's father decides to move out of town with family and asks Naaga to return the money which he owes, but Naaga denies and betrays Vithya's father. Blade comes for rescue and with his help, Vithya's father complains in a police station following which Naaga returns the money. Naaga decides to kill Blade for moving away from him. Vithya's father understands Blade's transformation and agrees to get Vithya married to him. On the day before Blade's wedding, Naaga's henchmen hit Blade but is saved. Blade decides to revenge and kills Naaga following which he surrenders in court.
