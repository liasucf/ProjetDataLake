One of the greatest female middle-distance runners of the 1980s, she also twice won the World Cross Country Championship (1982, 1984) and broke the world record for the mile in 1982. ==Career== Puic\u01ce was born in Ia\u0219i, Romania and competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where she finished seventh in the 1500 m. In 1978, she placed fourth in the 3000 m at the European Championships. In March 1982, she won the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. In August, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m at the European Championships behind Svetlana Ulmasova. She also finished fourth in the 1500 m final. A month later in September, she broke Mary Decker's world mile record of 4:18.08 with 4:17.44 in Rieti. Puic\u01ce missed the 1983 World Championships due to injury, but returned in early 1984 to win her second World Cross Country Championship title. Then in the Summer, she won the inaugural 3000 m title at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, a race remembered more for the collision of Mary Decker and Zola Budd. At those Games, she also won a bronze medal in the 1500 m behind Italy's Gabriella Dorio and Romanian teammate Doina Melinte.Maricica Puic\u0103. Sports Reference In July 1986, at the London Grand Prix, she broke Tatyana Kazankina's world 2000 m record of 5:28.72, with a time of 5:28.69. At the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m, behind Olga Bondarenko. She was also fifth in the 1500 m final. 1987 began with her winning a bronze medal in the 3000 m at the World Indoor Championships in Indianapolis, finishing behind the Soviet pair of Tatyana Samolenko and Bondarenko. Later that year, aged 37, she won a silver medal in the 3000 m at the World Championships in Rome, again behind Samolenko. Puica competed at her fourth and final Olympic Games in Seoul 1988, where she dropped out of her 3000 m heat with just 200 metres to go. In 1989, she spoke on Romanian television in support of the revolutionaries fighting against the regime of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu. (However Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu ignored the Soviet Union boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, in contrast to the other East European countries.) ==International competitions== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |1976 |Olympic Games |Montreal, Canada |heats |1500 m |4:12.62 |- |rowspan=2|1978 |World Cross Country Championships |Glasgow, Scotland |bgcolor=\"cc9966\"| 3rd | | |- |European Championships |Prague, Czech Republic |4th |3000 m |8:40.9 |- |1980 |Olympic Games |Moscow, Russia |7th |1500 m |4:01.26 |- |1981 |World Cup |Rome, Italy |bgcolor=\"silver\"| 2nd |3000 m |8:55.80 |- |rowspan=4|1982 |European Indoor Championships |Milan, Italy |bgcolor=silver | 2nd |3000 m |8:54.26 |- |World Cross Country Championships |Rome, Italy |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st | | |- |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Athens, Greece |4th |1500 m |3:59.31 |- |bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd |3000 m |8:33.33 |- |rowspan=3|1984 |World Cross Country Championships |New York, United States |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st | | |- |rowspan=2|Olympic Games |rowspan=2|Los Angeles, United States |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |1500 m |4:04.15 |- |bgcolor=\"gold\" | 1st |3000 m |8:35.96 |- |rowspan=2|1986 |rowspan=2|European Championships |rowspan=2|Stuttgart, Germany |5th |1500 m |4:03.90 |- |bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd |3000 m |8:35.92 |- |rowspan=2|1987 |World Indoor Championships |Indianapolis, United States |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |3000 m |8:47.92 |- |World Championships |Rome, Italy |bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd |3000 m |8:39.45 |- |1988 |Olympic Games |Seoul, South Korea |heats |3000 m |DNF |- |1989 |European Indoor Championships |The Hague, Netherlands |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |3000 m |9:15.49 |} ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Ia\u0219i Category:Romanian female middle-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Romania Category:Olympic gold medalists for Romania Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Romania Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Romania Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Cross Country Championships winners Category:World record holders in masters athletics Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Romanian female cross country runners Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Romania Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1977 Summer Universiade ",
