    "text": "Greenbelt Park is a park in Greenbelt, Maryland, that is managed by the United States National Park Service. The forested park lies approximately 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Washington, D.C., and is situated just within the Capital Beltway (which bounds the park to the northeast). The park land was originally intended to form part of the green belt surrounding the city of Greenbelt. The southern portion was assigned to the National Park Service, thus forming the park, while another section became part of the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC). View from the perimeter trail Recreational facilities include a 5.3 mile (8.5 km) mile hiking and equestrian trail, several shorter nature trails, numerous campsites, and three picnic areas. The park received its National Park designation in 1950, and was acquired along with the land that would form the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, which divides the park in a roughly north-south direction. Nearly all of the park's facilities are located within the larger western portion (the eastern portion has one fire road). == References == == External links == * * Birds of Greenbelt Park and the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center * * Greenbelt Park at the National Parks Conservation Association * Greenbelt Park at the National Park Foundation * NPSpecies for Greenbelt Park \u2014 Park Species List from the National Park Service * Greenbelt Park at Recreation.gov Category:Protected areas of Prince George's County, Maryland Category:National Park Service areas in Maryland Category:National Capital Parks-East Category:Greenbelt, Maryland Category:Parks in Prince George's County, Maryland Category:Protected areas established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in Maryland ",
