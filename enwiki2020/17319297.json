It is one of two famous temples of the same name in Ki\u00ean Giang, the other being in Ha Tien. == History == The site of the temple was the location where a local lady by the name of D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb C\u00e1n, also known Lady Ho\u1eb7ng, undertook her religious practices in the late 18th century. At the time Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac \u00c1nh, the nephew of the last of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, was the only surviving member of the family to escape from Saigon after his family had been killed in the uprising of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty. He went into hiding in the Mekong Delta in the late 1770s and 1780s, and Lady Ho\u1eb7ng was one of his benefactors. Later, he reunified Vietnam in 1802 for the first time in its modern state and proclaimed himself as Emperor Gia Long of the newly created Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. Gia Long had the temple built in honour of Lady Ho\u1eb7ng. The temple is located at 6 Th\u00edch Thi\u1ec7n \u00c2n Street in the town of R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1. The name sign of the temple is visible from Nguy\u1ec5n Trung Tr\u1ef1c Street. The main hall of the temple is built in the th\u01b0\u1ee3ng l\u1ea7u h\u1ea1 hi\u00ean architecture style. There is also a three-storey stupa to the side of the temple. The main hall of the temple is 14.50 m wide and 22 m long. The statues of Amitabha Buddha, Gautama Buddha and various bodhisattvas adorn altars with gold paint. The eastern sanctuary of the temple serves as a guest room and the office of the abbot. The western sanctuary is used as a dharma hall and also dispenses free medical treatment to local townsfolk. The history of the temple is closely associated with the achievements of Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Thi\u1ec1n (1882-1943), who was responsible for the renovations in 1917 that brought the temple into its current state. He was also the founder of the Southern Association of Buddhist Research, which came into being in 1931. The office of the association is at Linh Son Temple in what is now Ho Chi Minh City. He then returned to R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1 to form another Buddhist association for propagating dharma as well as social service. After the 1916 Cochinchina uprising against French rule, the temple was taken over by local revolutionaries who used it as a cover to manufacture munitions for attacking the French army. When the operations were discovered by French police, Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Thi\u1ec1n took the blame to spare the revolutionaries and was sent to C\u00f4n S\u01a1n island's prison for anti- colonials, where he died in 1943. Today, the temple is the headquarters of the board of the Provincial Buddhist Association of Ki\u00ean Giang. The temple was decreed to be a site of historical and cultural interest by the government of Vietnam on March 3, 1988. ==References== Category:Buddhist temples in Vietnam Category:Buildings and structures in Ki\u00ean Giang Province ",
