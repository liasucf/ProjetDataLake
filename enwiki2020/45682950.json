    "text": "The Bite Me Cancer Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c) organization, founded in Fairfax, Virginia in September 2010 by Nikki Ferraro and her parents, Sharon Ferraro and C. Michael Ferraro. Bite Me Cancer was founded with the goal to support teens with cancer, in addition to providing funding to research and improve awareness and advocacy for thyroid cancer. Bite Me Cancer partners with the American Thyroid Association to raise awareness and fund grants across the United States of America. Bite Me Cancer seek to both support teenagers with cancer, and raise fund for thyroid cancer research. == History == Nikki Ferraro was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, a rare form of thyroid carcinoma, in April 2010. Immediately following her diagnosis, she organized a Relay for Life team in support of her diagnosis, and two weeks later finished as the #1 individual fundraiser in South Atlantic Region of the American Cancer Society after raising over $20,000. Two months after the formation of Bite Me Cancer, Nicole Ferraro received the 2010 Leadership Fairfax Non-Profit Educational Leadership Award. The following year, she received the first-ever Perlita Liwanag Scholarship from the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults at Chantilly High School. Bite Me Cancer focuses on supporting teens undergoing cancer treatment, in addition to supporting the progression of thyroid cancer research and treatment development. On July 31, 2014, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared the third week of January, starting in 2015, Teen Cancer Awareness Week in the Commonwealth of Virginia, thanks to the hard work and determination of Ferraro and the Bite Me Cancer Foundation. McAuliffe stated in his declaration that \u201cthe health and safety of all Virginians is essential to the happiness and well-being of the Commonwealth\u2019s families and communities, whereas cancer is the leading cause of death in the adolescent population, and whereas the survival rates for adolescent cancer have not improved in the last thirty years.\u201d The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors provided a proclamation for Teen Cancer Awareness Week in January 2015, and Bite Me Cancer officially announced on January 4, 2015, that the awareness week would begin the same year. In his declaration, Governor McAuliffe also highlighted the fact that many teens battling cancer are \u201cisolated from their friends and family,\u201d and noted the importance of \u201cvigorously\u201d supporting them as they return to everyday social and academic settings. Bite Me Cancer and the Commonwealth of Virginia continue to raise awareness in schools and homes with this annual event. == Thyroid cancer== Ferraro explains that many people refer to thyroid cancer as the \u201cgood cancer\u201d due to the perception that there is not a high rate of mortality, its history of being diagnosed in a smaller group of people and that losing the thyroid isn't a difficult situation. However, thyroid cancer is dangerous and can be aggressive. Medullary thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for 3-4% of all thyroid cancer diagnoses. There is one current clinical trial that is studying thyroid gland medullary carcinoma. Currently, medullary thyroid cancer is noncurative, meaning that those diagnosed with this form of thyroid carcinoma will likely battle it for the rest of their lives. Two drugs have been approved for medulllary thyroid cancer treatment. == Research == Bite Me Cancer has funded six research grants for thyroid cancer in the past, and is working toward funding another during 2019. The first grant, totaling $57,500, was awarded in 2014 to Ramona Dadu, MD at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The two-year research project, titled \u201cImmune Markers in Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) and Their Clinical Significance\u201d, and began in July 2014. Dr. Dadu is an assistant professor at Anderson Cancer Center in the Department of Endocrine Neoplasia & Hormonal Disorders. Dadu also received the Women in Endocrinology Young Investigator Award and the American Thyroid Association Grant for her research in 2014. Dadu's research \u201cwill work with experts in the field of immunotherapy to uncover new information of prognosis and how medications interact with the cancer,\u201d. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to see that many patients will benefit from this approach.\u201d == Fundraising == Bite Me Cancer organizes annual events, including an annual wine dinner (2014\u2013present) every April to honor and celebrate with cancer survivors including Nikki, who was diagnosed in April 2010. The focus on onsite donations during the dinner is to support our Teen Support Bag program. There are currently few programs in place to support teenagers with cancer, but there are thousands of programs to support young children and adults. Teenagers with cancers often require specific treatment and support, and there is very little awareness of the struggles that teenagers with cancer face. By developing and shipping the Teen Support Bags to hospitals around the country for their teenagers battling cancer and holding events to raise awareness, Bite Me Cancer is participating in a movement to increase support and make more resources available to these special teenagers. In 2014, the George Mason University chapter of Kappa Phi Gamma, a national sorority, announced that all 2014 philanthropy-related C.A.R.E. Week donations would be to the Bite Me Cancer Foundation in support of raising awareness of thyroid cancer. In 2015, the national office of Kappa Phi Gamma selected Bite Me Cancer to be the recipient of all the sorority's C.A.R.E week fundraising across each of its chapters. == Teen Support Bags == Bite Me Cancer coordinates the distribution of multiple Teen Support Bag events every year. Each bag includes items to eliminate stress and support teenagers currently undergoing cancer treatment. Nikki Ferraro tries to travel to various hospitals and hand-deliver the bags to teens, offering advice and encouragement during their treatments. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Organizations established in 2010 Category:Cancer organizations based in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in Virginia ",
