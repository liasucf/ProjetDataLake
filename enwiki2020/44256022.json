Yet the crudity with which it is expressed with no pretension of niceties or subtleties is what sets it apart from a well-done product\". Chennai Online wrote \"This may not be as good as the actor-director's earlier films, but the message does come through, and some of the lines and situations are quite humorous.\" ==References== Category:2001 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian comedy-drama films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Films directed by Visu ",
