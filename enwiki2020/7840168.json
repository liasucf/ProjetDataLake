He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, first under Leon Bo\u00ebllmann, then under the centenarian Henri B\u00fcsser. Also, he was taught counterpoint and fugue by Georges Caussade and composition by Charles-Marie Widor. A Prix de Rome winner in 1911 and again in 1913 (on the latter occasion he shared the award with Lili Boulanger), he was appointed Director of Conservatoire at Versailles in 1932 and Director of the Paris Conservatoire in 1940, following the resignation of Henri Rabaud.Demuth, Norman (June 1954). \"Claude Delvincourt\". Musical Times 95 (1336): 330 During the German occupation of France, Delvincourt was forced to apply the racial laws of the Vichy government to the Paris Conservatoire, excluding Jewish professors and students.Schnapper-Flender, Laure (July 1999). \"La vie musicale sous l'Occupation\". Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle. Revue d'histoire 63: 142 But he managed, with the help of his former teacher's niece Marie-Louise Bo\u00ebllmann, to prevent numerous students from being compelled to join the STO (law of 16 February 1943). He gathered the young musicians in the Orchestre des Cadets du Conservatoire and convinced the German authorities that they were doing their duties by this method. Meanwhile, Delvincourt joined the Front National des Musiciens. Furthermore, he \"did all he could to protect his flock, never asking for papers and always trying to hide illegal students.\",Rampal, Jean- Pierre (1989). \"Music, My Love\". Chapter 4: Music by Default : page 43 succeeded in saving many students and was threatened by the Gestapo. He was forced to disappear until the end of the Military occupation. He died, still Conservatoire director, on April 5, 1954, from injuries he incurred in a car accident on a road in Orbetello, Italy. The great organist Marcel Dupr\u00e9 succeeded him in the directorship. ==Principal works== ===Orchestral works=== *Serenade or Radio-Serenade, suite for orchestra (1914) *Typhaon, symphonic poem (1914) *L'offrande \u00e0 Siva, choreographic poem for Large orchestra (1921) *Boccacerie, portraits for the \"Decameron\", version for orchestra (1924) *Croquembouches, Two pieces for piano and orchestra (1926) *Bal v\u00e9nitien, suite for orchestra (1927) *Choreographic Prelude for orchestra (1931) *Ce Monde de ros\u00e9e, version for orchestra (1934) *Film d'Asie, suite for orchestra (1937) after the documentary \"La Croisi\u00e8re Jaune\" (1934) *Pamir, suite for Large orchestra (1938) *Piano Concerto, unfinished (1954) ===Chamber music=== *Quintet for piano and string quartet (1907) *Trio for piano, violin and cello (1909) *Sonata for violin and piano (1922) *Croquembouches for saxophone and piano (1929) *Danceries, Five pieces for violin and piano (1930) *Contemplation for violin and piano (1935) *String Quartet (posthume) for Two violins, viola and cello (1954) ===Works for solo instruments=== *Five Pieces for piano (1923) *Boccacerie, Five portraits for the \"Decameron\", for piano (also version for orchestra) (1926) *Croquembouches, Twelve pieces for piano (1926) *Bal v\u00e9nitien, suite for orchestra, reduction for two pianos (1927) *Heures juv\u00e9niles, Twelve pieces for piano (1928) *Images pour les contes du temps pass\u00e9, for Four-hand piano (1935) *Three Pieces for organ (Marche d'\u00e9glise - M\u00e9ditation - Sortie de f\u00eate) (1937) ===Vocal and choral works=== *Thestylis, for soprano and orchestra, after Leconte de Lisle poem (1908) *Hodie Christus natus, for choir, oboe, bassoon and organ (1909) *Aurore, choir for female voices and orchestra (or piano), after Victor Hugo poem (1910) *Acis et Galath\u00e9e, cantata ; poem by Eug\u00e8ne Adenis (1910) *Nuit tombante, for mixed choir and orchestra (or piano), after Victor Hugo poem (1911) *Yanitza, cantata (1911) *La Source, choir for female voices and orchestra (or piano) (1912) *Fulvia, cantata (1912) *Berceuse, melody for voice and piano, after Maurice d'Assier poem (1912) *Faust and Helena, cantata ; poem by Eug\u00e8ne Adenis (1913) *Five Melodies for voice and piano, after Maurice d'Assier poems (1914) *Ave Verum Tota Pulchra Es, Motet for mixed choir, solo, organ and Strings (1920) *Ce Monde de ros\u00e9e, Fourteen Utas translated from Japanese (1925) *Onchets, Five melodies on poems by Ren\u00e9 Chalupt (1929) *Chansons de la ville et des champs, Six melodies in the popular style (1933) *Four Songs by Cl\u00e9ment Marot, melodies for soprano and piano (or orchestra) (1935) *Pater Noster, for Mezzo (or Soprano) and organ (1937) *Melody for voice and piano, after the poem \"Un \u00e9ventail, un sourire\" by Pierre Bedat de Monlaur (1942) *Salut solennel en sol, for choir, soli, organ and orchestra (1948) ===Incidental music=== *La femme \u00e0 barde, Farce in Two Acts ; Book by Andr\u00e9 de la Tourasse (1936) *Automne, Incidental Music with choirs (1937) *\u0152dipus-rex, Incidental Music with choirs (1939) *Lucifer ou Le Myst\u00e8re de Ca\u00efn, Mystere in One prologue and Three episodes ; Book by Ren\u00e9 Dumesnil (1940) ===Film and documentary music=== *La Croisi\u00e8re jaune, L\u00e9on Poirier and Andr\u00e9 Sauvage documentary (1934) * The Call of Silence, L\u00e9on Poirier film (1936) *S\u0153urs d'armes, L\u00e9on Poirier film (1937) *Brazza ou l'\u00e9pop\u00e9e du Congo, L\u00e9on Poirier film (1940) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1888 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Musicians from Paris Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Directors of the Conservatoire de Paris Category:20th-century classical composers Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Road incident deaths in Italy Category:20th-century French composers Category:20th-century French male musicians ",
