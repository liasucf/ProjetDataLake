The song, appearing in television advertisements for the Air Force, was set to imagery of airborne North American F-86 Sabres and a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress taking off in cloud of smoke. The copyright to the words and music for the song were subsequently purchased by the Air Force and released into the public domain; Mitch Miller rearranged \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" at a march tempo, the sheet music to which was distributed to both Air Force bands, and civilian bands and orchestras in the United States On February 3, 1957, Miller recorded \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" during this CBS Radio show during which Lt. Gen. Emmett \"Rosie\" O'Donnell, Jr. \u2013 commander of the Pacific Air Forces \u2013 appeared as guest. \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" performed by the U.S. Air Force Band in 2014 The song's popularity was such that, soon after introduction, an unsuccessful effort was made to replace \"The U.S. Air Force\" with \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" as the Air Force's official service song. Nonetheless, as of 2018, \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" remains an authorized piece of music in U.S. Air Force ceremonies and, according to the Air Force, \"the popularity of the song remains and it is performed regularly\". \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" played on television in 1957. ==Interpretation and significance== Writing in 1974, Richard Grid Powers quoted the lyrics of \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" in his description of the organizational imagery and theory of the Air Force, which he described as counter-military, hyper- rationalist, aspiring to a \"pure model of bureaucracy\", and intentionally obliviating historical references in favor of a vision of the future in which air power was glorified to the exclusion of all else and in which \"everything is where it ought to be ... [and] mankind has prevailed\". ==Lyrics (original)== The original lyrics to \"The U.S. Air Force Blue\" have been modified in later performances to introduce gender neutral language. > They took the blue from the skies And a pretty girl's eyes And a touch of > Old Glory's hue, And gave it to the men who proudly wear The U. S. Air Force > Blue, The U. S. Air Force Blue. Oh they are men with a dream On America's > team They're a rugged and ready crew, And you can bet your boots The world > looks up To U. S. Air Force Blue, To U. S. Air Force Blue. They know where > they're going, They set their course, The sky's no limit in the Air Force. ==See also== * Be All You Can Be * Music of the NOAA Corps * \"The U.S. Air Force,\" official song of the US Air Force ==References== Category:Jingles Category:1957 songs Category:United States Air Force music ",
