It was Turner who replaced his previous collaborator, Jan Howard, on his syndicated television and road show. The album consisted of ten tracks. Four of the album's tracks were written by Anderson, including the title track. Some of the other tracks were cover versions of songs recorded by other artists. Among these covers was \"Gone at Last\", a song first recorded as a duet by Paul Simon and Phoebe Snow. ==Release and chart performance== Sometimes was released in January 1976 on MCA Records.
