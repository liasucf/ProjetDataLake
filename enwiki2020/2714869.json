    "text": "Walter Flex (6 July 1887 \u2013 16 October 1917) was a German author responsible for The Wanderer between the Two Worlds: An Experience of War (Der Wanderer zwischen beiden Welten) of 1916, a war novel dealing with themes of humanity, friendship, and suffering during World War I. Due to his idealism about the Great War and the posthumous popularity of his writing, Walter Flex is sometimes compared to Allied war poets Rupert Brooke and Alan Seeger. ==Biography== Walter Flex was born at Eisenach, in the Kingdom of Prussia, on July 6, 1887. The second of four sons, Walter's father, a secondary school teacher, was a fervent admirer of Otto von Bismarck, and all four of his sons were brought up to revere the former German Chancellor. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Flex had a happy childhood and showed no interest in the world until the Second Anglo-Boer War began in 1898. Due to his sympathy for \"the underdog\", Flex, like many other Germans of his time, sympathised with the Boer Republics in their battle against the British Empire. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Flex went to the University of Erlangen where he studied German, thanks to the award of a bursary. According to Tim Cross, \"Walter Flex's first attempt at drama was the tragedy Demetrius, about the Tsarist Pretender. In his following works for the stage, social problems form the core, as in Lothar, Die Bauernf\u00fchrer, Das heilige Blut, and Der Kanzler Klaus von Bismarck. These revolve around the premise that society is necessary. Each individual is like a thread, insignificant, disposable, and only makes sense if he is a thread woven into the fabric of the carpet. Interesting as these plays are in the context in which they were written, it cannot be claimed that Flex was am original writers a dramatist, he laboured much under the influence of Hebbel. His poetry is the least distinguished of his output, and appears more as an exercise towards the prose works such as Wallenstein and Der Wanderer.\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, pp. 185\u2013186. Flex was successful academically and became a teacher like his father. His first appointment was as a private tutor to the family of Chancellor von Bismarck. A later appointment was to the family of Baron von Leesen, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the Great War in August 1914. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. Despite weak ligaments in his right hand, Flex volunteered for the Imperial German Army in his mother's birthplace of Rawitsch and was assigned to the 50th Infantry. By September 1914, Flex saw combat in the Argonne. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. According to Tim Cross, \"His poetic outpourings on the war were prolific. Two collections, Sonne und Schild and Im Felde Zwischen Tag und Nacht were produced in the first months of the war. His body, soul, and literary talent were placed wholly at the disposal of the war-effort. The Christmas Fable for the 50th Regiment earned him the Order of the Red Eagle with Crown.\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. While going through officer training at Posen in early 1915, Flex met Ernst Wurche, a fellow member of the Wandervogel youth movement. Wurche lived by the motto, \"To stay pure is to mature.\" Wurche also always carried three books in his backpack: the New Testament, the poems of Goethe, and Friedrich Nietzsche's Also Sprach Zarathustra. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 186. Flex viewed Wurche as the epitome of the new German and made his friend the subject of the novella Der Wanderer zwischen Beiden Weltem (\"A Wanderer between Two Worlds\"), which has never been out of print since its first publication. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, pp. 185\u2013186. Taking part in Operation Albion, Flex was wounded in action. He died of his wounds at Oti Manor, in Saaremaa on October 16, 1917. Walter Flex was buried in the cemetery of Peude Church in the village of the same name, on Saaremaa island, in modern Estonia. His epitaph was a quote from one of his works Preu\u00dfischer Fahneneid (\"The Prussian Military Oath\" written in 1915): :\"Wer je auf Preu\u00dfens Fahne schw\u00f6rt, :Hat nichts mehr, was ihm selbst geh\u00f6rt.\" (Translation: :\"He who on Prussia's banner swears :has nothing left that belongs to himself.\")Walter Flex.

H. Beck, and was well received. By 1917, over 700,000 copies had been printed in Germany\u2014a testament to his extreme popularity with the wartime public. Tim Cross compares Flex's posthumous popularity and the idealization of his wartime death with the similar cultus surrounding English war poet Rupert Brooke. Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, p. 185. Under the Weimar Republic, Flex's reputation grew further. Between 1933 and 1945, Flex's romanticism and idealism were exploited for propaganda by the Nazi Party, which found his poetry and prose especially appealing and considered Flex the epitome of Aryan ideals. According to Flex, however, \"It is not national patriotism I represent, but demands for the moral good. When I wrote about the perpetuity of the German race and about the deliverence of the world by the Germanic, it had nothing to do with national egotism; rather it is a moral conviction which can be realized as much in the defeat or in the heroic sacrifice of a nation.\" Tim Cross (1989) The Lost Voices of World War I: An International Anthology of Writers, Poets, and Playwrights, page 185. In 1940, Flex's body was moved from Estonia to a new military cemetery before of the Sackenheimer Tor at K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Walter Flex's grave, along with the rest the city, was destroyed in Allied air raids and during the three-month siege previous to the city's surrender to the Red Army on April 9, 1945.Fritz Gause. K\u00f6nigsberg in Preu\u00dfen. (Gr\u00e4fe und Unzer, 1968), p. 226. As a song, Flex's poem Wildg\u00e4nse rauschen durch die Nacht gained popularity with the Wandervogel youth and was well known and sung in Germany until the 1970s. During the time of (and partly due to his influence on) the German student movement, his reputation faded almost entirely . ==Memorial markers== * The house (built in 1723) where Flex lived during his student days (1906-1908) is at Friedrichstra\u00dfe 16.
