Like the other Chocolate phones, the phone has an MP3 player that runs on Dolby Mobile. Since its release in November 2009, roughly 1.2 million devices have been sold. The LG Chocolate Touch has a 3.2-megapixel camera. The device was also released on Alltel as the AX8575 or the LG Touch, as well as on U.S. Cellular as the UX8575 or LG Touch. The phone was discontinued in the fall of 2010 and was replaced by the Pantech Crux, which was another music-oriented phone. However, the Chocolate Touch on Verizon Wireless is still available as a Certified Pre-Owned device, free. ==External links== *LG Chocolate Touch Official Page Chocolate ",
