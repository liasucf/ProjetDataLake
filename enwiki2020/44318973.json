The film is an adaptation of the 1943 novel of the same title by Ignasi Agust\u00ed. The film is set amongst the high society of late nineteenth century Barcelona. Mariona Rebull is unhappily married, and begins an affair. She is eventually killed on 7 November 1893 when an anarchist Santiago Salvador throws a bomb into the stalls of the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona's opera house.
