After 8 years in the lowers divisions of Bulgarian football, in 1993 Pirin returned to B PFG. In their first season back in second division Pirin finished in eight place in the league. In the following 1994\u201395 season was a poor one for the club, ending with the team in second lowest place and relegated back to the third division. In 2005 they won the third promotion to the B PFG in its history. In December 2005, Yordan Bozdanski was appointed as manager. Pirin finished the 2006\u201307 season in third place in the West B PFG, their highest finish in the league since their \u0435stablishment.

Pirin were promoted to Bulgarian football's top division for the first time in their history. Their first season in the top level of Bulgarian football was successful. The team managed to win 10 games and draw 4, earning them 34 points. These results placed them in 11th position, three points above the relegation zone. At home, Pirin managed to win 6 games, as well as draw 3, including a 1-1 draw against Levski Sofia, the eventual runners-up of the 2012-13 season. Away results were also good, considering that this was the debut season for Pirin in the elite. They managed to win 4 games and draw once. Manager for the season was Tencho Tenev, who was appointed at the beginning of the season. For the upcoming season, the format of the Bulgarian league was changed, with the bottom seven teams qualifying for the relegation group. Pirin did not manage to repeat the same results from last season, as the team spent the majority of the season in the relegation group. They started the season with a draw against Lokomotiv Sofia. This was followed by eight defeats in a row, which placed them at the bottom of the table. They eventually finished 13th in the regular season, thus being placed in the relegation zone. The team did not improve its results there, losing four out of their six home games, as well as losing five out of six away games. At the end of the season, Pirin were 32 points below the relegation line, thus being relegated. This ended Pirin's two year stay in the A PFG. Although they were supposed to play in the B PFG next season (2014-15), Pirin Gotse Delchev did not obtain a license, and were demoted to the third tier. At the end of the 2017-18 season, Pirin were relegated to the fourth amateur league. After two seasons in the fourth tier, Pirin returned to the Third League in 2020. On June 6th, Pirin signed an agreement with Pirin Blagoevgrad, at the time playing in the second tier. The agreement will allow Pirin Blagoevgrad players to be loaned out to Pirin GD, thus making Pirin Gotse Delchev a satellite team of the other Pirin. ==Honours== ===League=== West B PFG *Champions: 2011\u201312 ===League positions=== ImageSize = width:800 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2021 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2003 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:16 color:white align:center from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:15 from:01/07/2003 till:01/07/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:7 from:01/07/2004 till:01/07/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2005 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"V Group\" from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/07/2006 till:01/07/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:3 from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011 shift:(0,-4) text:8 from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2012 color:white shift:(0,14) text: \"B Group\" from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2014 shift:(0,-4) text:13 from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2014 color:green shift:(0,14) text: \"A Group\" from:01/07/2014 till:01/07/2015 shift:(0,-4) text:3 from:01/07/2015 till:01/07/2016 shift:(0,-4) text:15 from:01/07/2014 till:01/07/2016 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"V Group\" from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2017 shift:(0,-4) text:10 from:01/07/2017 till:01/07/2018 shift:(0,-4) text:17 from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2018 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"3rd League\" from:01/07/2018 till:01/07/2019 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/2019 till:01/07/2020 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2018 till:01/07/2020 color:yellow shift:(0,14) text: \"Regional\" from:01/07/2020 till:01/07/2021 shift:(0,-4) text: from:01/07/2020 till:01/07/2021 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"3rd\" ==Current squad== '''' == Managers == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Managers in the 21st century |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Year ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Trainers |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2004\u201305 | Ventsislav Davidkov |- | 2005 | Valentin Lazarov |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2005\u201307 | Yordan Bozdanski |- | 2007 | Petar Zehtinski |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2008\u201310 | Yordan Bozdanski |- | 2010 | Krasimir Traykov |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2010\u201311 | Dimitar Sokolov |- | 2011 | Ivan Atanasov |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" | 2011\u201312 | Yakov Paparkov |- | Aug 1, 2012\u2013Aug 27, 2013 | Tencho Tenev |- | Aug 27, 2013\u2013Jan 1, 2014 | Kostadin Angelov |- | Jan 16, 2014\u2013Sep 11, 2017 | Yordan Bozdanski |- | Sep 11, 2017\u2013 | Rumil Zhotev |} == References == == External links == * Official site * Pirin Gotse Delchev at Bulgarian Club Directory. * Pirin Gotse Delchev at Soccerway.
