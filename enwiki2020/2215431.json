    "text": "\"WOW\" is a series of annual compilation albums featuring contemporary Christian music dating from 1995. Comprising songs submitted by each partner label, the annual WOW Hits releases are usually double CD sets. The series was officially cancelled in 2019. == Background == The birth of the WOW record project can be traced to Grant Cunningham, A&R; Director at Sparrow Records. In November 1994, Grant made a business trip to EMI Limited in London, which at the time was the parent company of Sparrow Records. There he noticed that several British record labels were issuing an annual CD of top-rated songs, known as the NOW series, containing collections of pop songs. Grant brought the idea back to Sparrow. Sparrow executives suggested a similar project be developed for Christian pop music and Grant was assigned the task of getting the project off the ground. The WOW franchise represents the most successful collections of Christian music ever issued. Released in late 1995, WOW 1996 was the first in the WOW Series and the first recording put together by the three major Christian record companies of the time: Word Records (now Word Entertainment), Sparrow Records (formerly part of EMI Christian Music Group), and Reunion Records (now part of Sony's Provident Label Group). Still today, after each submitting label agrees to a reduced master royalty, the final decision on the tracks to be included is made by committee. Production, marketing, and distribution for the \"WOW Hits\" series was handled by EMI Christian Music Group, and from 2013, by Capitol Christian Music Group, which is now a Universal Music Group company. In 1999, the annual WOW Worship series was launched. Rather than using the year, each release is identified by the color of the cover. The worship series and hits series are today among the best-selling members of the product brand. Beginning in 2008, WOW began releasing separate single-disc collections spread throughout each year, rather than a two-disc collection toward the end of each year. In addition to WOW Hits, which focuses on the most popular pop and pop-rock music, plans call for either single-disc WOW Rock Hits and WOW Pop Hits collections released twice a year. ==Released annually== ===WOW Series=== WOW Series was the first and most successful series of WOW collections, and contains the following albums: {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Certifications |- style=font-size:smaller; ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Christ |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW 1996 | * Release date: November 7, 1995 * Label: Sparrow, EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 144 | 7 | * US: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW 1997 | * Release date: October 29, 1996 * Label: Sparrow, EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 71 | 1 | * US: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW 1998 | * Release date: November 4, 1997 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 52 | 2 | * US: Platinum * CAN: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW 1999 | * Release date: October 20, 1998 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 51 | 2 | * US: 2\u00d7 Platinum * CAN: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW 2000 | * Release date: October 26, 1999 * Label: Sparrow, EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 29 | 1 | * US: 2\u00d7 Platinum * CAN: Gold |} === Wow Hits === In the year 2000, the WOW Series was rebranded to WOW Hits, forming the second and also the most successful series of WOW collections. In 2008, the WOW Series contemplated releasing three single discs per year instead of the annual double discs fans of the series were used to. Only one disc was ever released in the spring of 2008 before reverting to the annual format. That disc was WOW Hits 1. It is not known why the publishers decided to return to the annual format instead of the three-disc format, which was inspired by the Now That's What I Call Music! series, which releases 3 discs annually. It contains the following albums: {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Certifications ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- style=font-size:smaller; ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Christ |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2001 | * Release date: October 24, 2000 * Label: Sparrow, EMI * Formats: CD, Cassette tape, Music download | 36 | 1 | * US: 2\u00d7 Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2002 | * Release date: October 23, 2001 * Label: Sparrow * Formats: CD, digital download | 52 | 2 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2003 | * Release date: October 1, 2002 * Label: Chordant * Formats: CD, digital download | 34 | 1 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2004 | * Release date: October 7, 2003 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, digital download | 51 | 1 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2005 | * Release date: October 5, 2004 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, digital download | 39 | 1 | * US: Platinum * CAN: Gold | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2006 | * Release date: October 4, 2005 * Label: Chordant * Formats: CD, digital download | 42 | 1 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2007 | * Release date: October 3, 2006 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, digital download | 38 | 1 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2008 | * Release date: October 2, 2007 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, digital download | 56 | 2 | * US: Gold | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 1 | * Release date: April 8, 2008 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, Digital Downloadhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1TOmUiqNnCTO9Tlv2wvNUK | 99 | 4 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2009 | * Release date: October 7, 2008 * Label: Word * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 31 | 1 | * US: Platinum | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2010 | * Release date: October 6th, 2009 * Label: Word * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 33 | 1 | * US: Platinum | * US: 338,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2011 | * Release date: October 5, 2010 * Label: Word * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 26 | 1 | *US: Gold | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2012 | * Release date: September 27, 2011 * Label: Provident * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 35 | 1 | *US: Gold | * US: 284,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2013 | * Release date: September 25, 2012 * Label: EMI * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 39 | 1 | *US: Gold | * US: 282,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2014 | * Release date: September 24, 2013 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 29 | 1 | * US: Gold | * US: 162,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2015 | * Release date: September 30, 2014 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: CD, Digital Download | 23 | 1 | | * US: 155,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2016 | * Release date: September 25, 2015 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: Digital download, CD | 55 | 1 | | * US: 140,000 |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2017 | * Release date: September 23, 2016 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: Digital download, CD | 64 | 1 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2018 | * Release date: October 6, 2017 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: Digital download, CD | 113 | 3 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| WOW Hits 2019 | * Release Date: October 5, 2018 * Label: Capitol CMG * Formats: Digital download, CD | \u2014 | 5 | | |} ===WOW Gospel=== WOW Gospel are released annually, beginning with WOW Gospel 1998. The focus of this series is gospel, and the compilation has been issued every year since 1998. Since the release of WOW Gospel 2003, a major metropolitan city that has been influential in the field of gospel music has been honored on the album cover.
