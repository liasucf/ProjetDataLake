    "text": "Amen Corner is a 2007 novel by American author Rick Shefchik, published March 9 by Poisoned Pen Press. A mystery/thriller set at the Masters Tournament of golf, it centers on Minneapolis police detective and amateur golfer Sam Skarda, as he competes in his first Masters and tries to stop a crazed killer determined to put an end to the tournament. It is the first in a series about Skarda and his adventures investigating crime in the sports world. The second, Green Monster, was published August 1, 2008. ==Reviews== Bill Ott of Booklist said of the novel \u201cShefchik\u2026takes his share of shots at the green-jacketed elite who run the Masters, but he makes a game attempt at realism, both in his portrayal of the tournament itself and in his premise: a Minneapolis cop, on medical leave, wins the U.S. Publinx Championship and qualifies for the Masters\u2026 Shefchik combines a surprisingly grisly plot and a convincing villain with plenty of more or less realistic golf action \u2026 this one makes the cut. Entertaining \u2026\u201d Susan Pettrone of Reader Views said \u201cI found myself thoroughly enjoying every moment of this book. The sharp character of Sam, the smarts of Caroline and the cool determination of the killer, all make for an extremely entertaining read \u2026 I would highly recommend \u2018Amen Corner\u2019 for anyone with a love of golf as it is not only a mystery but a look behind the scenes of the Masters \u2026 from start to finish \u2026 a winner in every sense of the word\u2026a great read and an engaging story all wrapped up in one.\u201d Marx Swanholm of the Minneapolis Star Tribune called Amen Corner \"an entertaining novel, full of inside details on America's closely guarded cathedral of golf.\" == External links == * Rick Shefchik Official Website * Poisoned Pen Press Category:2007 American novels Category:American crime novels Category:Novels about golf Category:Masters Tournament Category:Novels set in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
