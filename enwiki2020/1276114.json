He is well known as the rosh yeshiva of many great rabbis including Rabbi Solomon Luria, who married his daughter Lipka. Haberkasten was rosh yeshiva in Lviv, and was later the first rabbi of the city of Ostroh, Volhynia. He left Ostroh to assume the position of rosh yeshiva in Brest and Luria succeeded him in Ostroh. Haberkasten then went to Eretz Yisroel, in about 1560. Haberkasten was also a Kabbalist and was known to have made the acquaintance of the great Kabbalists in the Holy Land, including Rabbi Chaim Vital. == References == * Category:Early Acharonim Category:16th-century rabbis Category:16th-century Polish people Category:Polish rabbis Category:Rabbis in Ottoman Palestine Category:Polish emigrants to Israel Category:Rosh yeshivas Category:Kabbalists Category:Talmudists Category:Year of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown ",
