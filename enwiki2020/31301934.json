The data is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is also protected by a further layer of on-disk encryption.Kenneth Geisshirt: Backing up for portables with Box Backup , March 2008. Retrieved 28 Mar. 2011. Box Backup supports Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Mac OS X backup clients and servers (although Windows servers are not recommended by the authors). Box Backup is licensed under the GNU GPL and BSD licenses. ==Introduction== Box Backup is a client-server application in which a client sends data to the server for storage. The server provides management of client via certificates, storage quotas, and data retention. Together, a unique and robust solution is created that scales allowing clients with low-bandwidth connections to effectively perform reliable backups. Box Backup is ideal for backing up laptops and computers with intermittent or low-bandwidth connections, because it is capable of continuous data protection in the background, starting automatically when an internet connection is present, and recovering gracefully and efficiently from connection failures.Cory Buford: Automatic backup for sporadically connected clients with Box Backup, August 2008. Retrieved 12 Apr. 2011 Box Backup uses a modified version of the Rsync algorithm, that works with encrypted blocks. This allows it to store data on the server in a form that the server operator cannot read, while still uploading only changed portions of data files.Vrable, Savage, Voelker: Cumulus: Filesystem Backup to the Cloud, 2009.
