    "text": "Antigone is the third full-length album of the German metal band Heaven Shall Burn. It was released on April 26, 2004 through Century Media Records. == Background == The title was inspired by the female character of the play Antigone by Sophocles. The play is about a passionate young woman, that does what she knows is right, even though it is against the law. She makes sure that all of the town's people know what she did and she is punished by the king. The intro and the two outros were composed and recorded by Icelandic composer \u00d3lafur Arnalds. A video was made for \"The Weapon They Fear\", a song that commemorates V\u00edctor Jara. \"Tree of Freedom\" deals with the life of Nelson Mandela. \"Voice of the Voiceless\" refers to the band's strong pro-vegan stance. \"Bleeding to Death\" deals with the economic and social problems in the former East Germany, from where the band originates. The song \"The Dream is Dead\" was featured in an episode of Viva la Bam, entitled \"Viva La Europe Pt. 2\". == Reception == In 2005, Antigone was ranked number 474 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. == Track listing == == Credits == Production and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes. ;Heaven Shall Burn * Marcus Bischoff \u2013 vocals * Patrick Schleitzer \u2013 guitar * Maik Weichert \u2013 guitar * Eric Bischoff \u2013 bass * Matthias Voigt \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians * Alexander Dietz \u2013 clean vocals on \"To Harvest the Storm\", \"The Dream Is Dead\" * \u00d3lafur Arnalds \u2013 piano, samples, keyboard on \"Echoes\", \"R\u00edsandi Von\", \"Deyjandi Von\" * Greta Salome Stefansdottir \u2013 violin on \"Echoes\", \"R\u00edsandi Von\", \"Deyjandi Von\" * Thordur Gudmundur Herrmannson \u2013 cello on \"Echoes\", \"R\u00edsandi Von\", \"Deyjandi Von\" ;Production * Patrick W.
