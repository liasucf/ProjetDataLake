    "text": "Swinhoe's prinia (Prinia striata) is a species of bird in the family Cisticolidae. It was formerly lumped with the Himalayan prinia (P. crinigera) as the striated prinia, but was split from it following a study published in 2019. It is distributed throughout mainland China and Taiwan. It is sympatric with P. crinigera in the Yunnan Province of China. There are three known subspecies: P. s. catharia, which ranges from northeast India through Myanmar to south-central China, P. s. parumstriata, which is distributed throughout southeast and central China, and P. s. striata, which is restricted to Taiwan. == References == Category:Prinia Category:Birds of China Category:Birds of Taiwan Category:Birds described in 1859 ",
