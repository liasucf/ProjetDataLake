    "text": "Juan Bautista Sacasa (21 December 1874 in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua \u2013 17 April 1946 in Los Angeles, California) was the President of Nicaragua from 1 January 1933 to 9 June 1936. He was the eldest son of Roberto Sacasa and \u00c1ngela Sacasa Cuadra, the former's cousin twice removed. He was a relative of Benjam\u00edn Sacasa. Born in the town of Le\u00f3n, Sacasa studied in the United States from 1889 to 1901, earning an M.D. from Columbia University.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515180/Juan-Bautista- Sacasa He served as a professor and dean of faculty at the National University in Le\u00f3n, and was a supporter of the Liberal regime of Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya. In 1924, Sacasa became a member of a political coalition headed by moderate Conservative Carlos Sol\u00f3rzano. Shortly afterwards, the detachment of U.S. Marines which had remained in Nicaragua for thirteen years withdrew, believing that the political situation was stable. In October 1925, Sol\u00f3rzano's government was overthrown by former President General Emiliano Chamorro, who failed to gain U.S. recognition and subsequently resigned in favor of Adolfo D\u00edaz. In the meantime, Sacasa fled to Mexico. Following an uprising by Liberal soldiers in Puerto Cabezas, Sacasa returned to Nicaragua in 1926. Asserting his claim as constitutional president, he established a government in Puerto Cabezas. Supplied by Mexico with arms and munitions, the Liberal rebels, under the command of General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada, nearly succeeded in capturing Managua. However, the U.S. forced the two warring parties to enter into negotiations, resulting in the Pact of Espino Negro, which required that both sides would disarm and D\u00edaz would be allowed to finish his term.http://countrystudies.us/nicaragua/10.htm Sacasa reluctantly agreed to accept the agreement and withdraw his claim to the presidency, but refused to sign the pact and left the country; leaving Moncada to sign the pact on Sacasa's behalf.http://www.sandinorebellion.com/Top100pgs/Top100-p2a.html Over the next six years, a formerly obscure Liberal general named Augusto Sandino would lead a guerilla war against the Marines, who had remained in the country to enforce the agreement. In 1932, Sacasa was elected President. He took office on January 1, 1933, the day before the scheduled departure of the Marines. At the insistence of the U.S. Ambassador, he named Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, who was married to one of his nieces, as director of the Guardia Nacional (National Guard). The following month, Sacasa met with Sandino, during which Sandino pledged his loyalty to the new government in exchange for amnesty and land for his followers. Sandino continued to call for the disbanding of the National Guard and, in February 1934, he was assassinated under orders from Somoza. Despite Sacasa's disapproval, he proved unable to contain the growing power of Somoza and the National Guard. His popularity continued to diminish as Nicaragua's fragile economy suffered the collapse of coffee prices due to the Great Depression and allegations of widespread fraud surfaced in the 1934 congressional elections. Meanwhile, Somoza's power continued to grow, and he cultivated ties with former presidents Moncada and Chamorro. Early in 1936, Somoza used the National Guard to purge local officials loyal to the president and replace them with his associates. On June 9, he forced Sacasa to resign, appointing a series of puppet presidents before assuming the presidency himself the following year. Afterwards, Sacasa fled into exile in the U.S., living in Los Angeles until his death ten years later. He married Mar\u00eda Arg\u00fcello Manning, a cousin of Leonardo Arg\u00fcello, 66th President of Nicaragua; together, they had the following children: *Maruca Sacasa Arg\u00fcello *Carlos Sacasa Arguello *Roberto Sacasa Arguello *Gloria Sacasa Arguello Juan Bautista Sacaza was the first cousin of Bertha Lacayo Sacaza. Bertha Lacayo Sacasa was married to Lisimaco Lacayo Solorzano and they had only one child Will Lacayo Lacayo. Will Lacayo Lacayo had four children Danilo Lacayo, Bertha Lacayo, Ligia Lacayo and Tania Lacayo. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua Category:Nicaraguan people of Spanish descent Category:Liberal Party (Nicaragua) politicians Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Vice Presidents of Nicaragua Category:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni Category:People of the Banana Wars ",
