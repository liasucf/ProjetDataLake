    "text": "John Rylett Salew (b.1902, (some sources state 1 January 1897)14 September 1961) was an English stage film and TV actor. Salew made the transition from stage to films in 1939, and according to Allmovie, \"the manpower shortage during WWII enabled the stout, balding Salew to play larger and more important roles than would have been his lot in other circumstances. He usually played suspicious-looking characters, often Germanic in origin.\" His screen roles included William Shakespeare in the comic fantasy Time Flies (1944), Grimstone in the Gothic melodrama Uncle Silas (1947), and the librarian in the supernatural thriller Night of the Demon (1957). John Salew was active into the TV era, playing the sort of character parts that John McGiver played in the US ==Selected filmography== * It's in the Air (1938) \u2013 RAF Radio Operator (uncredited) * Dead Men are Dangerous (1939) \u2013 Tramp (uncredited) * The Silent Battle (1939) \u2013 Ernest * The Chinese Bungalow (1940) \u2013 Mr. Lum * Pastor Hall (1940) * A Window in London (1940) \u2013 Reporter * The Thief of Bagdad (1940) \u2013 Fish Peddler (uncredited) * Neutral Port (1940) \u2013 Wilson * Sailors Don't Care (1940) \u2013 Henri * The Farmer's Wife (1941) \u2013 Mr. Rundle * Inspector Hornleigh Goes To It (1941) \u2013 Mr. Tomboy * Turned Out Nice Again (1941) \u2013 Largos * Once a Crook (1941) \u2013 Solicitor * Atlantic Ferry (1941) \u2013 Henry * Back-Room Boy (1942) \u2013 Steve Mason * One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942) \u2013 German Sentry * Suspected Person (1942) \u2013 Jones * The Day Will Dawn (1942) \u2013 \"Man-in-the- Street\" in Fleet Street Pub * The Young Mr. Pitt (1942) \u2013 Smith * Secret Mission (1942) \u2013 Hauptmann Gruening * Squadron Leader X (1943) \u2013 Sentry at Madame Berthelot's (uncredited) * Tomorrow We Live (1943) \u2013 Marcel LaBlanc * We Dive at Dawn (1943) \u2013 Drake (uncredited) * The Bells Go Down (1943) \u2013 Landlord (uncredited) * Warn That Man (1943) \u2013 Wilson * The Saint Meets the Tiger (1943) \u2013 Merridon (curator of the Baycome Museum) * Millions Like Us (1943) \u2013 The Doctor * The Adventures of Tartu (1943) \u2013 Heinrich M\u00fcller (uncredited) * The Night Invader (1943) \u2013 Witsen * The Hundred Pound Window (1944) \u2013 Walker * Tawny Pipit (1944) \u2013 Pickering * Time Flies (1944) \u2013 William Shakespeare * The Way Ahead (1944) \u2013 Sam \u2013 Friend of Pvt Lloyd in Pub Scene (uncredited) * Give Us the Moon (1944) \u2013 (uncredited) * Don't Take It to Heart (1944) \u2013 Dr. Rose, witness * Candles at Nine (1944) \u2013 Griggs \u2013 Everard's Butler * Murder in Reverse (1945) \u2013 Blake King's Counsel * The Rake's Progress (1945) \u2013 Burgess * Caravan (1946) \u2013 Diego * Beware of Pity (1946) \u2013 Col.
