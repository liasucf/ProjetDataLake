    "text": "Dakota (Dakh\u00f3tiyapi, Dak\u021f\u00f3tiyapi), also referred to as Dakhota, is a Siouan language spoken by the Dakota people of the Sioux tribes. Dakota is closely related to and mutually intelligible with the Lakota language. It is critically endangered, with only around 290 fluent speakers left out of an ethnic population of almost 20,000. ==Morphology== ===Nouns=== Dakota, similar to many Native American languages, is a mainly polysynthetic language, meaning that different morphemes in the form of affixes can be combined to form a single word. Nouns in Dakota can be broken down into two classes, primitive and derivative. Primitive nouns are nouns whose origin cannot be deduced from any other word (for example make or earth, peta or fire, and ate or father), while derivative nouns are nouns that are formed in various ways from words of other grammatical categories. Primitive nouns stand on their own and are separate from other words. Derivative nouns, on the other hand, are formed by the addition of affixes to words in other grammatical categories, such as verbs, adjectives, and other nouns. ===Verbs=== Verbs in Dakota can appropriate, through agglutination and synthesis, many of the pronominal, prepositional, and adverbial or modal affixes of the language. There are many verbal roots, all of which are only used once certain causative prefixes are added, forming participles. Like in English, Dakota verbs also have three persons, the first, the second, and the third. Person is indicated through the addition (first and second person) or subtraction (third person, the verb is used in its simplest form) of personal pronoun affixes. There are two forms of tense in the language, the aorist (sometimes called the indefinite) and the future. In order to express the future tense, the words kta or kte are placed after the verb, much in contrast to expressing the aorist tense, which requires no marking, but is instead derived from the context of what is being said. ===Possessive pronouns and pronominal affixes=== In order to show possession in Dakota, a possessive pronoun must be prefixed onto whichever noun is being possessed. Two forms of possessive nouns occur, the natural class and the artificial or alienable class. Natural class pronouns express possession that cannot be alienated, and when prefixed to a noun, signifies the different parts of one's self. For example, the possessive natural article pronoun mi-, which means \"my,\" can be added to nouns such as \"eye,\" in miista, or \"words,\" in mioie. Meanwhile, artificial possessive pronouns are used to signify property and possessions that can be transferred or traded. For example, the artificial pronoun ta- or ti-, which is equivalent to the singular her or him, can be prefixed onto nouns such as \"bow,\" in tinazipe, and \"friend,\" in takodaku. ==Syntax== ===Nouns and verbs=== Dakota is mainly a subject-object-verb (SOV) language, where nouns, whether they are the subject or object, always come before the verb. And when two nouns are used in the same clause, where one is the subject and the other is the object, the subject is most usually placed first. Verbs are also usually placed after adjectives that are used to qualify either the subject or the object and adverbs that qualify the verb. When additional words are used within a clause that are not either nouns or verbs, the nouns, both subject and object, are always placed at the beginning of the clause. ==Dialects== Dakota has two major dialects with two sub-dialects each (and minor variants, too): # Eastern Dakota ( Santee-Sisseton or Dakh\u00f3ta) #* Santee (Is\u00e1\u014by\u00e1thi: Bdew\u00e1kha\u014bthu\u014bwa\u014b,Formerly Mdew\u00e1kha\u014bthu\u014bwa\u014b Wa\u021fp\u00e9khute) #* Sisseton (Sis\u00edthu\u014bwa\u014b, Wa\u021fp\u00e9thu\u014bwa\u014b) # Western Dakota (a.k.a. Yankton-Yanktonai or Dak\u021f\u00f3ta/Dakh\u00f3ta, and erroneously classified, for a very long time, as \"Nakota\"for a report on the long- established blunder of misnaming \"Nakota\" the Yankton and the Yanktonai, see the article Nakota) #* Yankton (Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014b) #* Yanktonai (Ih\u00e1\u014bkt\u021fu\u014bwa\u014bna) #** Upper Yanktonai (Wi\u010dh\u00edyena) The two dialects differ phonologically, grammatically, and to a large extent, also lexically. They are mutually intelligible to a high extent, although Western Dakota is lexically closer to the Lakota language with which it has higher mutual intelligibility. ==Writing systems== For a comparative table of the various writing systems conceived over time for the Sioux languages, cf. the specific section of the article Sioux language. ==Phonology== ===Vowels=== Dakota has five oral vowels, , and three nasal vowels, . {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" | !

Yankton-Yanktonai is in fact lexically closer to the Lakota language than it is to Santee-Sisseton.

This significantly impacts word forms, especially in fast speech and it is another reason why Yankton-Yanktonai has better mutual intelligibility with Lakota than with Santee-Sisseton.

The Association on American Indian Affairs website offers an extensive selection of Dakotah learning resources, including CDs, DVDs, flashcards, and software. ===Curriculum, textbooks, and other materials for teaching and learning Dakh\u00f3ta=== A Level 1 Speak Dakota! textbook is available from the Dakh\u00f3ta I\u00e1pi Okh\u00f3daki\u010dhiye. Developed by Dakota language speakers, teachers, and linguists, the textbook is the first fully illustrated Dakota language textbook that is linguistically and pedagogically consistent. Dakota language learning materials are also available on their website. ==References== ==Bibliography== * DeMallie, Raymond J. (2001). Sioux until 1850. In R. J.
