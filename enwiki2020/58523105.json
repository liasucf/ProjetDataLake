It is the flagship SUV of the Spanish car maker above the SEAT Arona and the SEAT Ateca, optionally available with seven seats. It is based on the Volkswagen Group's MQB-A2 platform, while closely related to the Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace and the \u0160koda Kodiaq. It is named after the Mediterranean city of Tarragona, and it is manufactured in the historic plant of Volkswagen Wolfsburg in Germany. The production model was presented on 18 September 2018, and debuted at the 2018 Paris Motor Show in October 2018. == Name == The name of the vehicle is intended to commemorate Tarraco, the former capital of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. This corresponds to the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). The name of the SUV was determined by a public vote and everyone was invited to suggest a name related to a Spanish geography with a maximum of three syllables. The initiative began in 2017, and in total, 10,130 suggestions from more than 130,000 people were received. After a preliminary examination based on linguistic and legal criteria, SEAT chose nine options, Abrera, Albor\u00e1n, Ar\u00e1n, Aranda, \u00c1vila, Donosti, Tarifa, Tarraco and Teide \u2013 among which Albor\u00e1n, Aranda, \u00c1vila and Tarraco were qualified for a final vote. With the Tarraco, SEAT for the first time in its history, let the name of one of its models be chosen among the people. Originally, the name of the new SUV should have been announced in October 2017, however due to the independence referendum held in Catalonia at the time, SEAT finally announced the name on 19 February 2018. Of more than 150,000 participants, more than 35 percent voted in favour of Tarraco. == Overview == Rear view The vehicle was launched in Tarragona, which is a town the car was named after.
