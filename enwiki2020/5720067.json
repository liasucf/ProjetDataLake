    "text": "Celebrate Brooklyn! is one of New York City\u2019s longest-running, free, outdoor performing arts festivals. Launched in 1979 by the then Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn, as a catalyst for Brooklyn's performing arts scene and to bring people back into Prospect Park after years of neglect, Celebrate Brooklyn was an anchor in the park's revitalization and has become one of the city's foremost summer cultural attractions. Over the course of its history, the festival has presented over 2,000 artists and ensembles reflective of the borough's diversity, ranging from internationally acclaimed performers to emerging, cutting-edge artists. The festival attracts upwards of 250,000 attendees from across New York City to the Prospect Park Bandshell each summer. The festival is produced by BRIC, an organization that presents contemporary art, performing arts, and media programs throughout Brooklyn. Celebrate Brooklyn's music programming features established and emerging artists in a large and adventurous array of styles and genres ranging from regional American roots music, extremely varied world-music, classical and new music, jazz, pop and alt-rock, and hip-hop.
