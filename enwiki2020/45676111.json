    "text": "Comical Corner or Comical Corners is an unincorporated community located within Pemberton Township in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States.Locality Search, State of New Jersey. Accessed March 14, 2015. The site of the actual corners is at the intersection of Pemberton Road (County Route 630) and Arneys Mount Road (CR 668). The original name may have been \"Conical Corner\" based on the cone-like shape of the skewed intersection but had turned to \"Comical Corner\" based on a mishearing. The area, located just to the north of Pemberton Borough, is mostly rural and is surrounded by farmland on the two obtuse sides of the intersection. ==References== Category:Pemberton Township, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in Burlington County, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey ",
