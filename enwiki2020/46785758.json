    "text": "Rangiriri is a rural community in the Waikato District and Waikato region of New Zealand's North Island. It is located on the Waikato River near Lake Waikare in the Waikato District. State Highway 1 now bypasses Rangiriri. Rangiriri was the site of a major M\u0101ori defence structure during the time of the Invasion of the Waikato, the major campaign of the New Zealand Wars. The Battle of Rangiriri, which took place on 20\u201321 November 1863, cost both sides more than any other engagement of the land wars and also resulted in the capture of 183 M\u0101ori prisoners, which impacted on their subsequent ability to oppose the far bigger British force. A section of the 2017 symbolic reinterpretation of Rangiriri p\u0101. As part of work on the Waikato Expressway, the NZ Transport Agency has restored a p\u0101 site that straddled State Highway 1; the work was completed for the 150th anniversary of the battle. Rangiriri has two marae belonging to the Waikato Tainui hap\u016b of Ng\u0101ti Hine, Ng\u0101ti Naho, Ng\u0101ti Pou and Ng\u0101ti Taratikitiki: Horahora Marae and Te Whare i Whakaarohia meeting house, and Maurea Marae and Ng\u0101 Tumutumu o Rauwhitu meeting house.
