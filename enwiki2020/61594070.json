So export items vary depending on more or less occasional business opportunities. Normally, export figures have more than doubled from 20 million euros in 2010. In 2013, large quantities of oil would cease to be imported, which is reflected in the fall in imports over the year 2012. On the other hand, in 2013 and 2014, imports were mainly due to the purchase of copper, which in 2014 accounted for 93% of total imports. In 2015, imports increased considerably as a result of oil purchases, reaching 210 million eurosFicha de la Rep\u00fablica del Congo Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Economic relations. In general, there is a growing interest of Spanish companies in the Congolese market, due to their strong growth (6.8% of GDP in 2014) and although exports increased in 2015, they are expected to decrease in 2016 as a result of the oil price crisis and the little progress in improving the business climate. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce of Spain there has been no direct Spanish investment in R. Congo or R. Congo in Spain CESCE opened its coverage to the RC in the second half of 2015. ==See also== * Foreign relations of the Republic of the Congo * Foreign relations of Spain == References == Spain Republic of the Congo ",
