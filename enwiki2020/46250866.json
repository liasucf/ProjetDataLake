Jacob rides to Red Bluff hoping to reconcile with his son, unaware that King Fisher holds a grudge and intends to shoot down Jacob, first chance. Riley accompanies his father on the trail, setting their family ranch ablaze first, never letting him out of his sight. Jacob's sight, meantime, is fading; he is slowly going blind, a fact he hides from his son. Riley refuses to forgive his father until old friend Ben Ryerson explains to him that Jacob didn't desert his mother at all. King comes to town with his men. Riley, aware for the first time of his father's failing vision, acts as his eyes in directing Jacob where to shoot. King's men die and he tries to sneak away, but he and Jacob end up in a showdown anyway and kill one another. Jacob dies in his son's arms. == Cast == *Jack Palance as Jacob Wade *Anthony Perkins as Riley Wade *Neville Brand as King Fisher *Elaine Aiken as Ada Marshall *Robert Middleton as Ben Ryerson *Elisha Cook, Jr. as Willie *Claude Akins as Blackburn *Lee Van Cleef as Faro *Harry Shannon as Dr. Fisher *James Bell as Judge Hart *Adam Williams as Lon *Denver Pyle as Brad *John Doucette as Sundown Whipple *Paul Newlan as Fence Green *Tennessee Ernie Ford as Singer == References == == External links == * Category:1957 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1957 Western (genre) films Category:Films directed by Henry Levin ",
