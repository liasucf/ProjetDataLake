Slovakia\u2019s forests contain a wide biodiversity and animals include brown bears, wolves, foxes, wild boars, muskrats, chamois and lynxes. Slovakia features a high percentage of wildlife included in protected areas. There are hardly any mountain ranges and areas not under some form of protection. High Tatras are Slovakia's highest mountains One of Slovakia's main tourist attractions are the Tatra Mountains, (particularly the High Tatras), the highest part of the Carpathians. They feature many rare plant and animal species and offer numerous skiing, hiking and mountaineering opportunities. Rivers and streams in the mountains of Slovakia are often used for rafting and other white-water based activities and sports. The use of rafts has a very long tradition and especially rafts on the spectacular Dunajec river are very popular among tourists. Slovakia contains numerous mineral springs and spas. There were 94 destination spas in 2007, which contained more than 11,900 beds. In 2007, there were 276,200 visitors in Slovak spas, which is a 9% increase from 2006. 35.2% of the visitors were foreign. The Dem\u00e4nov\u00e1 Ice Cave has attracted visitors since its discovery in the 13th century The spas include: *Balneological spas: Bojnice, Brusno, Dudince, L\u00fa\u010dky, Pie\u0161\u0165any, Sklen\u00e9 Teplice, Slia\u010d, Smrd\u00e1ky, Tren\u010dianske Teplice, Tur\u010dianske Teplice *Climatic spas: Nov\u00fd Smokovec, \u0160t\u00f3s, \u0160trbsk\u00e9 Pleso, Tatransk\u00e9 Matliare, High Tatras *Mixed spas: Bardejovsk\u00e9 K\u00fapele, \u010c\u00ed\u017e, Nimnica, Rajeck\u00e9 Teplice and Vy\u0161n\u00e9 Ru\u017ebachy New water parks are being built throughout the country. Recently built parks include Tatralandia in Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Aquacity in Poprad and Aquathermal in Senec. Slovakia's karst areas offer an extremely high number of caves and their list is being expanded every year owing to new discoveries. The number of caves per capita may be the highest in Europe . Thirteen caves are open to the public, the longest of which is 9 km long. Some of them have been proclaimed as UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. Among them, Ochtinsk\u00e1 Aragonite Cave is one of three aragonite caves in the world. ==Architecture and landmarks== ===Castles=== Bratislava, Hrad, Slovensko.jpg|Bratislava Castle Trenciansky hrad (2007).jpg|Tren\u010d\u00edn Castle Spissky Hrad-LV-2.jpg|Spi\u0161 Castle Slovakia Oravsky Podzamok.jpg|Orava Castle Slovakia contains many castles, most of which are in ruins. The best known castles include Bojnice Castle (often used as a filming location), Spi\u0161 Castle (the largest fortified castle in Europe , on the UNESCO list), Orava Castle, Bratislava Castle, and the ruins of Dev\u00edn Castle. \u010cachtice Castle was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', Elizabeth B\u00e1thory. ===Historical architecture=== Slovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the multicultural Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg monarchy and Czechoslovakia) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the Czech Republic (such as Prague), Austria (such as Salzburg) or Hungary (such as Budapest). A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in Bratislava, Tren\u010d\u00edn, Ko\u0161ice, Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Levo\u010da, and Trnava. Historical centers have been going through restoration in recent years. ===Churches=== Bratislava14Slovakia52.JPG|St. Martin's Cathedral in Bratislava Modr\u00fd kostol sv\u00e4tej Al\u017ebety.

Most of them are built in the Baroque style, but there are also many examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, for example Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Bardejov and Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Kapitula. The St. James Church in Levo\u010da with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in \u017dehra with medieval frescos are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The St. Martin's Concathedral in Bratislava served as the coronation church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the Great Moravian period in the 9th century. Very precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by Catholics, Lutherans and members of eastern-rite churches. ===Folklore=== Folk architecture is well preserved \u2013 for example, in \u010ci\u010dmany Slovakia also has rich folk traditions: songs, dances, folk art, folk costumes and folk and vernacular architecture. Complete historical villages were preserved only in some cases, such as in \u010ci\u010dmany, Vlkol\u00ednec (UNESCO site), Brhlovce, \u0160pania Dolina, Ostur\u0148a, Podbiel, Star\u00e1 Hora in Sebechleby, Plaveck\u00fd Peter, Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Lev\u00e1re, and \u017ddiar. ===Souvenirs and shopping=== Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, \u010drp\u00e1ks (wooden pitcher), fujaras (a folk instrument on the UNESCO list) and vala\u0161kas (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from corn husks and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organization \u00da\u013dUV (\u00dastredie \u013eudovej umeleckej v\u00fdroby - Center of Folk Art Production). Dielo shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities. Prices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighboring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower . ===Museums and galleries=== ===Sport=== ==Food and beverage== Food remains relatively cheap compared to Western Europe. Slovakia offers regional wines and beer brands. The most popular wines are from the Tokaj, Little Carpathians, Nitra, Topo\u013e\u010dany and Z\u00e1horie regions. Hubert is a Slovak sparkling wine brand and Karpatsk\u00e9 Brandy \u0160peci\u00e1l is a popular brandy. Dem\u00e4novka and Horec are traditional herbal liqueurs. Other popular Slovak distilled beverages include slivovica (plum brandy) and borovi\u010dka, made of juniper berries. Popular beer brands are Topvar, Zlat\u00fd Ba\u017eant, \u0160ari\u0161, and Corgo\u0148. Cheese and cheese products (especially bryndza, korb\u00e1\u010dik, o\u0161tiepok, parenica, and tvaroh cheeses), \u017ein\u010dica are traditional Slovak specialties. It is voluntary, that if you are satisfied with services in restaurant or in a pub, you can give staff tips, as these are not included in the final bill. It could be up to 10 percent of the total bill. ==Objects on the UNESCO World Heritage List== Church of All Saints of Tvrdo\u0161\u00edn Objects currently on the list: *Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (a former major mining town) and tajchy (ancient water reservoirs around the town) *Bardejov (a historic town) *Levo\u010da, Spi\u0161 Castle and associated cultural monuments **Levo\u010da **Spi\u0161 Castle **a medieval ecclesiastical town Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Kapitula **frescos in a medieval church in \u017dehra **Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Podhradie *Vlkol\u00ednec (folk architecture) *Caves in the Slovak Karst: **Dob\u0161in\u00e1 Ice Cave **Domica Cave **Gombasek Cave **Jasovsk\u00e1 Cave **Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1 Cave **Ochtinsk\u00e1 Aragonite Cave *Primeval beech forests in Poloniny National Park and Vihorlat Mountains (localities: Have\u0161ov\u00e1, Stu\u017eica, Ro\u017eok and Kyjovsk\u00fd prales) *Wooden churches in central and eastern Slovakia (in Hervartov, Tvrdo\u0161\u00edn, Ke\u017emarok, Le\u0161tiny, Hronsek, Bodru\u017eal, Ladom\u00edrov\u00e1, Rusk\u00e1 Bystr\u00e1) == History == Tourism in what is today Slovakia began to develop in the mid-19th century when travellers started to visit the High Tatra and Low Tatra mountains. The first accommodation and catering facilities were built in the late 19th century and this development accelerated after 1918 with the creation of Czechoslovakia. The number of tourists grew steadily from 270,000 domestic and 45,000 foreign tourists in 1926 to 546,000 domestic and 82,000 foreign tourists in 1936. The development of the tourist industry slowed down during World War II. After the introduction of the Communist regime in 1948, Westerners were no longer welcomed in Czechoslovakia, which naturally caused material losses to the tourism industry. Tourism was controlled by the communist regime ideologically, politically and economically, and the regime failed to invest sufficiently in tourism facilities and infrastructures (with the exception of the High Tatra region). On the other hand, however, since most Czechoslovakian citizens were virtually prohibited from travelling abroad (especially to the West), the regime had to provide more recreational facilities for the population in its own country: In 1989 (at the end of the Communist regime), there were 988 accommodation facilities (389 hotels, 17 motels, 200 hostels, 82 camping sites, 130 cottage camps and other) with 145,822 beds in Slovakia. These were used by some 3.9 m tourists (956,702 from abroad). The biggest tourist centers included Bratislava, High Tatras, Ko\u0161ice, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and Pie\u0161\u0165any. The number of travel agencies (\u010cEDOK, Tatratour, Slovakotourist, Javorina etc.) was limited by the government. After the fall of Communism in 1989, Slovakia's tourism began to adapt to the condition of market economy. The facilities were gradually privatised and new facilities have been built, also with the help of foreign capital. Dozens of new travel agencies have been established, and the number of tourist from abroad and income from tourism increased considerably. Passive tourism (Slovaks travelling abroad) increased as well \u2013 in the 1990s Slovaks travelled predominantly to the neighbouring countries and Croatia, and since the late 1990s the foreign destinations of Slovaks have shifted to major world tourist destinations (Egypt, France, Indonesia etc.). ==Trivia== In 2006, the government of Slovakia formally protested against the film Hostel, stating that the film portrayed Slovakia as a dangerous country with police corruption, where tourists could easily be kidnapped and murdered. The film, the government stated, damaged the image of Slovakia and could be harmful to the tourism industry. ==See also== *List of castles in Slovakia *List of caves in Slovakia *List of national parks of Slovakia ==References== ==External links== * List of the business in Slovakia * List of the lawyers in Slovakia * Slovak national tourism portal * Official website of the Slovak Tourist Board * Guided tours in Slovakia * Resort in Slovakia Slovakia ",
