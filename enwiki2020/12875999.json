    "text": "You're Only Young Once is a 1937 comedy film directed by George B. Seitz. Following A Family Affair, it is the second film of the Andy Hardy series. Lewis Stone replaces Lionel Barrymore as Judge Hardy while Fay Holden replaced Spring Byington as his wife since both Barrymore and Byington were too expensive for the sequel's modest budget. Mickey Rooney would repeat his role as Andy while Cecilia Parker, as his sister, and Sara Haden, as Aunt Milly, would also reprise their roles from the original film. They were the only original actors transferred to the series.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/518/You-re-Only-Young-Once/articles.html ==Synopsis== The Hardy family goes to Catalina for a two-week vacation, where Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) tries to catch a swordfish, Marian (Cecilia Parker) falls in love with a married lawyer/lifeguard, and Andy goes around with a \"sophisticated\" girl. They return home to Carvel to find that by having endorsed a note for Frank Redmond (Frank Craven), Judge Hardy might lose all their property to Hoyt Wells (Selmer Jackson). Luckily, through an old law that Judge Hardy learned about while fishing with Capt. Swenson (Charles Judels), their home is saved and Hoyt Wells is run out of town. ==Cast== * Lewis Stone as Judge James K.
