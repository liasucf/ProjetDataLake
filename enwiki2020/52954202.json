She had her breakout role as Sandy in the 2016 film Manchester by the Sea as well as being a series regular in the CBS sitcom Superior Donuts in its first season. == Early life == Baryshnikov is the daughter of Russian American ballet dancer and actor Mikhail Baryshnikov and former ballet dancer Lisa Rinehart. As a young girl, Baryshnikov tried taking beginner's ballet classes but decided she was unsuited for discipline, as she was too hyperactive and talkative when she was supposed to be focused at the barre. Her elder half-sister, from her father's relationship with actress Jessica Lange, is dancer Shura Baryshnikov. Anna grew up in Palisades, New York, and attended school in New York City. == Career == Baryshnikov began acting at age 6 in a children's theater production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, portraying Peaseblossom, a handmaiden to fairy queen Titania. After graduating from Northwestern University in 2014, she began acting professionally on various television series, including Doll & Em on HBO. Her parents were initially hesitant about her career choice before becoming supportive. Baryshnikov's most prominent role to date was in the 2016 critically acclaimed drama Manchester by the Sea, alongside Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. Her character, Sandy, is a girlfriend of Patrick Chandler, portrayed by Lucas Hedges. She practiced her character's Boston accent by working with a dialect coach and going to Boston-area malls to hear how local teenage girls really spoke. She starred as grad student Maya in the CBS series Superior Donuts, based on the play of the same name by Tracy Letts. The series, which debuted in February 2017, was renewed for a second season by CBS, but Baryshnikov's character does not appear in the second season, with Maya having completed her thesis towards the end of Season 1. In 2017, she appeared in the Broadway production of the play Time and the Conways. In 2018, she appeared in drama film The Kindergarten Teacher. On September 26, 2018, Baryshnikov was cast in the lead role of Lavinia Norcross Dickinson in Apple TV+ series Dickinson, alongside Hailee Steinfeld. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ Film |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" | Director ! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 2016 ! scope=\"row\" | Wiener-Dog | Tara | Todd Solondz | |- | 2016 ! scope=\"row\" | Manchester by the Sea | Sandy | Kenneth Lonergan | Nominated\u2014Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Ensemble Nominated\u2014Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Nominated\u2014Washington D.C.
