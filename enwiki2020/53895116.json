The 2017 season will be sponsored by Ajinomoto (S) Pte Ltd, making it the 1st season which is to be sponsored by a Japanese Company. ==Controversy== On December 11, 2017, a mass brawl broke out during their match against SAFSA. The incident happened in time added on in the second half when Zulfadhli Suzliman (signed from GYL) was sent off with Safsa leading 3-2. Coach Yakob Hashim said to Straits Time that Zulfadhli told him that Nazirul (from SAFSA) verbally abused his mother and he retaliated with a kick, which led to his red card. Due to the fighting case between the team and SAFSA in the 2017 NFL match, the following players were given ban. 1) Haziq Sudhir & Zulfadhli Suzliman \u2013 4 months suspension 2) Azlan Razak, Fawwaz Anuar & Muhaimin Mansor \u2013 6 months suspension 3) Zul Feshal \u2013 12 months suspension 4) Hidayat Rohaizad and Sharil Jupri \u2013 15 months suspension ==Squad== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:80%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| No. ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| Name ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| Nationality ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| Position (s) ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| Date of Birth (Age) ! style=\"background:#0000CD; color:yellow; text-align:center;\"| Previous Club |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Goalkeepers |- | 1 | Kamarul Rosielin | | GK | | Home United |- | 13 | Fawwaz Anuar SUS | | GK | | Hougang United |- | 18 | Asyraf Asyfar | | GK | | GFA Sporting Westlake |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center;\"| Defenders |- | 2 | Salihin Shafiee | | DF | | Eunos Crescent |- | 3 | Syazni Ramlee | | MF | | Eunos Crescent |- | 4 | Faliq Sudhir | | DF | | Eunos Crescent |- | 6 | Shahir Hamzah | | DF | | Hougang United |- | 14 | Marnix Lafeber | | DF | | |- | 16 | Haziq Sudhir SUS | | DF | | Eunos Crescent |- | 23 | Azlan Razak SUS | | DF | | GFA Sporting Westlake |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Midfielders |- | 5 | Muhaimin Mansor SUS | | MF | | |- | 9 | Satish Varmaan | | MF |26 February 1998 (age 20) |Home United |- | 10 | Nur Ridho Jafri | | MF | | Hougang United |- | 11 | Rafiq Jamal | | MF | | Warwick Knights |- | 15 | Hidayat Rohaizad SUS | | MF | | |- | 21 | Nur Na'im Ishak | | MF | | Hougang United |- | 25 | Zulfadhli Suzliman SUS | | MF | | Young Lions FC |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Forwards |- | 7 | Shamsurin Rahman | | FW | | Singapore Recreation Club |- | 12 | Zulkiffli Hassim | | FW | | Balestier Khalsa |- | 17 | Zul Feshal SUS | | FW | | GFA Sporting Westlake |- | 19 | Amirul Walid | | FW | | Bishan Barx |- | 20 |Asnol As'at | | FW | | Starlight Soccerites |- | 22 | Sharil Jupri SUS | | FW | | Bishan Barx |- | 24 | Zulkifli Suzliman | | MF | | Young Lions FC |- |} ==Transfers== ===Pre- Season=== ====In==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:75%; text- align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- !Position !Player !Transferred From !Ref |- | | | Hougang United | |- | | |GFA Sporting Westlake | |- | | |Home United | |- | | | Eunos Crescent | |- | | |Eunos Crescent | |- | | |Eunos Crescent | |- | | |Eunos Crescent | |- | | |Eunos Crescent | |- | | |Hougang United | |- | | |Hougang United | |- | | |GFA Sporting Westlake | |- | | |Warwick Knights | |- | | |Tampines Rovers | |- | | | Bishan Barx | |- | | |Bishan Barx | |- | | |Hougang United | |- | | |Balestier Khalsa | |- | | |GFA Sporting Westlake | |- |} ====Out==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:75%; text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- !Position !Player !Transferred To !Ref |- | | |Jungfrau Punggol FC | |- | | |Re-signed with team in midseason | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | |Jungfrau Punggol FC | |- | | | | |- | | |Warwick Knights FC | |- | | | | |- | | |SAFSA | |- | | |Re-signed with team in midseason | |- | | | Siglap FC | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | | |Eunos Crescent | |- | | | Warriors FC | |- | | | Warriors FC | |- | | | | |- |} ===Mid Season=== ====In==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:75%; text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- !Position !Player !Transferred To !Ref |- | | |Starlight Soccerites | |- | | |Free Agent | |- |} ====Out==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:75%; text-align:center; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- !Position !Player !Transferred To !Ref |- | | |Jungfrau Punggol FC | |- | | |Warwick Knights FC | |- | | | | |- |} ==Competitions== ===NFL=== ===FA Cup=== ==References== Category:Singaporean football clubs 2017 season ",
