Pa as found in standard Brahmi, Pa was a simple geometric shape, with variations toward more flowing forms by the Gupta Pa. The Tocharian Pa Pa had an alterante Fremdzeichen form, Pa. The third form of pa, in Kharoshthi (Pa) was probably derived from Aramaic separately from the Brahmi letter. ===Brahmi Pa=== The Brahmi letter Pa, Pa, is probably derived from the Aramaic Pe 13px, and is thus related to the modern Latin P and Greek Pi. Several identifiable styles of writing the Brahmi Pa can be found, most associated with a specific set of inscriptions from an artifact or diverse records from an historic period.Evolutionary chart, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Vol 7, 1838 As the earliest and most geometric style of Brahmi, the letters found on the Edicts of Ashoka and other records from around that time are normally the reference form for Brahmi letters, with vowel marks not attested until later forms of Brahmi back-formed to match the geometric writing style. {|class=\"wikitable\" |+Brahmi Pa historic forms |- !Ashoka (3rd-1st c.

It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter ka, after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. Letters that derive from it are the Gujarati letter \u0aaa, and the Modi letter \ud805\ude22. ===Devanagari-using Languages=== In all languages, \u092a is pronounced as or when appropriate. Like all Indic scripts, Devanagari uses vowel marks attached to the base consonant to override the inherent /\u0259/ vowel: {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Devanagari \u092a with vowel marks |- ! Pa !!

Devanagari exhibits conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts. In modern Devanagari texts, most conjuncts are formed by reducing the letter shape to fit tightly to the following letter, usually by dropping a character's vertical stem, sometimes referred to as a \"half form\". Some conjunct clusters are always represented by a true ligature, instead of a shape that can be broken into constituent independent letters. Vertically stacked conjuncts are ubiquitous in older texts, while only a few are still used routinely in modern Devanagari texts. The use of ligatures and vertical conjuncts may vary across languages using the Devanagari script, with Marathi in particular preferring the use of half forms where texts in other languages would show ligatures and vertical stacks. ====Ligature conjuncts of \u092a==== True ligatures are quite rare in Indic scripts. The most common ligated conjuncts in Devanagari are in the form of a slight mutation to fit in context or as a consistent variant form appended to the adjacent characters. Those variants include Na and the Repha and Rakar forms of Ra. Nepali and Marathi texts use the \"eyelash\" Ra half form Ra for an initial \"R\" instead of repha. * \u0930\u09cd (r) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature rpa: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0928 (na) gives us the ligature pna: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0930 (ra) gives us the ligature pra: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature p\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0924 (ta) gives us the ligature pta: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0924\u09cd (t) + \u0930 (ra) gives us the ligature ptra: 100px ====Stacked conjuncts of \u092a==== Vertically stacked ligatures are the most common conjunct forms found in Devanagari text. Although the constituent characters may need to be stretched and moved slightly in order to stack neatly, stacked conjuncts can be broken down into recognizable base letters, or a letter and an otherwise standard ligature. * \u091b\u09cd (c\u02b0) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature c\u02b0pa: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1pa: 100px * \u0921\u09cd (\u1e0d) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e0dpa: 100px * \u0926\u09cd (d) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature dpa: 100px * \u0919\u09cd (\u014b) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u014bpa: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u091a (ca) gives us the ligature pca: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0921 (\u1e0da) gives us the ligature p\u1e0da: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u091c (ja) gives us the ligature pja: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u091c\u09cd (j) + \u091e (\u00f1a) gives us the ligature pj\u00f1a: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0932 (la) gives us the ligature pla: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0919 (\u014ba) gives us the ligature p\u014ba: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature p\u1e47a: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u091e (\u00f1a) gives us the ligature p\u00f1a: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u091f (\u1e6da) gives us the ligature p\u1e6da: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0920 (\u1e6d\u02b0a) gives us the ligature p\u1e6d\u02b0a: 100px * \u0920\u09cd (\u1e6d\u02b0) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e6d\u02b0pa: 100px * \u091f\u09cd (\u1e6d) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e6dpa: 100px ==Bengali Pa== The Bengali script \u09aa is derived from the Siddha\u1e43 13px, but lacks the horizontal head line, and has a less geometric shape than its Devanagari counterpart, \u092a. The inherent vowel of Bengali consonant letters is /\u0254/, so the bare letter \u09aa will sometimes be transliterated as \"po\" instead of \"pa\". Adding okar, the \"o\" vowel mark, gives a reading of /po/. Like all Indic consonants, \u09aa can be modified by marks to indicate another (or no) vowel than its inherent \"a\". {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Bengali \u09aa with vowel marks |- ! pa !! p\u0101 !! pi !! p\u012b !! pu !! p\u016b !! pr !! pr\u0304 !! pe !! pai !! po !! pau !! p |-style=\"font-size: 150%;\" |\u09aa |\u09aa\u09be |\u09aa\u09bf |\u09aa\u09c0 |\u09aa\u09c1 |\u09aa\u09c2 |\u09aa\u09c3 |\u09aa\u09c4 |\u09aa\u09c7 |\u09aa\u09c8 |\u09aa\u09cb |\u09aa\u09cc |\u09aa\u09cd |} ===\u09aa in Bengali-using languages=== \u09aa is used as a basic consonant character in all of the major Bengali script orthographies, including Bengali and Assamese. ===Conjuncts with \u09aa=== Bengali \u09aa exhibits conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts, with a tendency towards stacked ligatures as an initial head consonant, and linear (horizontal) ligatures as a trailing consonant. * \u09b2\u09cd (l) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature lpa: 100px * \u09ae\u09cd (m) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature mpa: 100px * \u09ae\u09cd (m) + \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b0 (ra) gives us the ligature mpra, with the ra phala suffix: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b2 (la) gives us the ligature pla: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09a8 (na) gives us the ligature pna: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature ppa: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b0 (ra) gives us the ligature pra, with the ra phala suffix: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b0\u09cd (r) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature prya, with the ra phala and ya phala suffixes 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b8 (sa) gives us the ligature psa: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09a4 (ta) gives us the ligature pta: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u099f (\u1e6da) gives us the ligature p\u1e6da: 100px * \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature pya, with the ya phala suffix: 100px * \u09b0\u09cd (r) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature rpa, with the repha prefix: 100px * \u09b8\u09cd (s) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature spa: 100px * \u09b8\u09cd (s) + \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b2 (la) gives us the ligature spla: 100px * \u09b7\u09cd (\u1e63) + \u09aa (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e63pa: 100px * \u09b7\u09cd (\u1e63) + \u09aa\u09cd (p) + \u09b0 (ra) gives us the ligature \u1e63pra, with the ra phala suffix: 100px ==Javanese Pa== ==References== Category:Indic letters ",
