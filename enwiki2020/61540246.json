The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers at intermediate sprints (three seconds to first, two seconds to second, and one second to third) and at the finish of all stages to the first three finishers: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. The leader of the classification received a yellow jersey; it was considered the most important of the 2019 Tour de Wallonie, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race. {| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 10 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Points for | 6 || 4 || 2 ||colspan=2| 0 |} There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a white jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either first, or second-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Points for the points classification |- ! scope=\"col\" | Position ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4 ! scope=\"col\" | 5 ! scope=\"col\" | 6 ! scope=\"col\" | 7 ! scope=\"col\" | 8 ! scope=\"col\" | 9 ! scope=\"col\" | 10 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Stage finishes | 25 || 20 || 15 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 |} Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. For winning a stage, a rider earned 25 points, with 20 for second, 15 for third, 10 for fourth and so on, down to 1 point for 10th place. There was also a separate classification for the intermediate sprints, rewarding a purple jersey. Points towards the classification were awarded on a 5\u20133\u20131 scale at intermediate sprint points during each stage; these intermediate sprints also offered bonus seconds towards the general classification as noted above. Finally, the leader in the classification for young riders, wore a red bib number. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 28 July 1995 were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. A combativity award was also given each day to the most aggressive rider on that stage. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width:2%;\"|Stage ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Winner ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|General classification 25px ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Points classification 25px ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Mountains classification 25px ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Young rider classification alt=A white jersey with a red number bib. ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Sprints classification 25px ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Teams classification ! style=\"width:12.25%;\"|Combativity award |- ! 1 | Timothy Dupont |style=\"background:#FFEA66;\"| Timothy Dupont |style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| Timothy Dupont |style=\"background:offwhite;\"| Nicolai Br\u00f8chner |style=\"background:salmon;\"| Abram Stockman |style=\"background:pink;\"| Kevyn Ista |style=\"background:navajowhite;\"| | Edward Planckaert |- ! 2 | Lo\u00efc Vliegen |style=\"background:#FFEA66;\" rowspan=\"4\"| Lo\u00efc Vliegen |style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| Lo\u00efc Vliegen |style=\"background:offwhite;\" rowspan=\"4\"| Toon Aerts |style=\"background:salmon;\" rowspan=\"4\"| Chris Lawless |style=\"background:pink;\"| Emiel Vermeulen |style=\"background:navajowhite;\" rowspan=\"2\"| | Tom Wirtgen |- ! 3 | Davide Cimolai |style=\"background:lightgreen;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Timothy Dupont |style=\"background:pink;\"| Dries De Bondt | Thijs Aerts |- ! 4 | Arnaud D\u00e9mare |style=\"background:pink;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Emiel Vermeulen |style=\"background:navajowhite;\" rowspan=\"2\"| | Arnaud D\u00e9mare |- ! 5 | Tosh Van der Sande |style=\"background:lightgreen;\"| Bryan Coquard | Lionel Taminiaux |- !colspan=2| Final !style=\"background:gold\"| Lo\u00efc Vliegen !style=\"background:limegreen\"| Bryan Coquard !style=\"background:white;\"| Toon Aerts !style=\"background:red\"| Chris Lawless !style=\"background:#cc5490\"| Emiel Vermeulen !style=\"background:#FF8C00;\"| !
