Breakfast Point is located 16 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. It is in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay.Australian Suburb Guide: Sydney Inner West Retrieved 7 August 2013. ==History== According to historical records, the suburb name is derived from the first contact between Europeans and the traditional owners of the land, the Wangal Clan. The encounter took place on 5 February 1788 during Captain John Hunter's exploration of the Parramatta River, while Hunter was having breakfast.Russell, Eric. Drummoyne: a western suburbs' history from 1794. Drummoyne, N.S.W.: Council of the Municipality of Drummoyne, Second Edition, 1982. . William Bradley, First Lieutenant on board , recorded the following entry in the log: > We landed to cook breakfast on the opposite shore to them (Breakfast Pt.). > We made signs to them to come over and waved green boughs.

We tied beads etc. about them and left > them our fire to dress their muscles which they went about as soon as our > boats put off. Hunter, who was later to become Governor of New South Wales, is also remembered in the name of the nearby suburb of Hunters Hill.Cobley, John (Compiler). Sydney Cove 1788 - in the Words of Australia's First Settlers : The True Story of a Nation's Birth. . Much of the area at Breakfast Point was occupied by the Mortlake Gas Works of the Australian Gaslight Company (AGL). AGL began developing the site from 1883. The Mortlake Gasworks site offered river access for colliers\u2014known as 'sixty milers'\u2014to bring coal and virtually unlimited space for expansion. The gas works remained in operation until the 1990s when in 1998 AGL, after a selected tender process, selected Rosecorp Pty. Ltd. to progressively acquire and develop the Mortlake site. Redevelopment has proceeded since then.Broomham, R. 1986, Mortlake 1886-1986, AGL Pty.

The New South Wales State Government took control of the approval process for the development from Canada Bay Council in August 2005, citing lengthy delays. Issues that arose between the council and the developer, Rosecorp, included the provision of public transport, public access to the area and its landscaping. There are several streets with architecturally designed modern houses and many modern apartment blocks in the suburb, such as Hunter's Wharf on the Parramatta River. ==Gallery== Image:Breakfast Point Community Hall.JPG| Breakfast Point Community Hall Image:Breakfastpointpano.jpg| Panorama of Breakfast Point ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Canada Bay ",
