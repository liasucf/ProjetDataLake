    "text": "Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is a highly sensitive assay for prion detection. The \"quaking\" in the name of the technique refers to the fact that samples in the RT-QuIC assay are literally subjected to shaking. This action breaks apart aggregates of prion protein (PrP) that are then further incubated, amplifying the amount of misfolded PrP to detectable levels. It is \"an early, rapid and specific assay for prion diseases\". It samples cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and so it is applicable to scrapie, chronic wasting disease (CWD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and sporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, amongst others. The RT-QuIC assay uses as reagents normally folded prions, fluorescently labelled so that they indicate when they are misfolded; samples suspected of containing misfolded prions are added and misfolded reagents can be detected by thioflavin T visible spectrum fluorescence detection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes a positive RT-QuIC result in its diagnostic criteria for the probable diagnosis of sCJD. ==See also== * Protein misfolding cyclic amplification * Western blot ==References== Category:Prions ",
