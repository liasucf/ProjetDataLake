In 1999, Ike Turner released his own autobiography, Takin' Back My Name, which in part is a rebuttal of the image presented of him in Tina's book and the film. The book was reissued by Dey Street Books in 2010. ==References== Category:African-American autobiographies Category:Music autobiographies Category:1986 non-fiction books Category:Tina Turner Category:Books adapted into films Category:Books about singers Category:Literature by African- American women ",
