    "text": "Rock Fork Lakes Conservation Area is a nature preserve and former strip mine in Boone County, Missouri. Located north of Columbia, Missouri adjacent to Finger Lakes State Park it is over 2000 acres of lakes, wetlands, forest, and prairie. Much of the land is severely degraded from strip mining by the Peabody Coal Company from 1963-1972. The land was acquired by the Missouri Department of Conservation in 1979. An unstaffed shooting range is open to the public and was renovated in 2014. The 50-acre Rocky Fork Lake has a boat ramp and is used for fishing. It is named after Rocky Fork Creek. ==See also== *Three Creeks Conservation Area *Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area *Rock Bridge Memorial State Park ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Area map Category:Conservation Areas of Missouri Category:Protected areas of Boone County, Missouri Category:Landforms of Boone County, Missouri ",
