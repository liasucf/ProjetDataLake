He came to New Spain in 1749, and accompanied explorers Francisco Pal\u00f3u and Jun\u00edpero Serra. In 1767 he went to the Baja California Peninsula and was placed in charge of the Misi\u00f3n La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n de Cadegom\u00f3. In 1769, Cresp\u00ed joined the expedition led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 and Jun\u00edpero Serra (see Timeline of the Portol\u00e1 expedition). He traveled in the vanguard of the land expedition to San Diego, led by Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada, where a presidio and mission were established. Cresp\u00ed then continued north with Portol\u00e1 and Rivera to identify the port of Monterey. Because he was the only one of the Franciscans to make the entire journey by land, Cresp\u00ed became the first official diarist for the missions. He was one of three diarists to document the first exploration by Europeans of interior areas of Alta California. After reaching Monterey in October 1769, Cresp\u00ed continued with the expedition that explored as far north as present-day San Francisco, and became one of the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay. All told, the expedition traveled in the future state of California through the present-day coastal counties of San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Mateo, and San Francisco. In 1772, Cresp\u00ed accompanied Captain Pedro Fages on an exploration of areas to the east of San Francisco Bay. The Fages expedition members were the first Europeans to see the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin Valley. In 1774, Cresp\u00ed was chaplain of the expedition to the North Pacific conducted by Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez. His diaries, first published in H. E. Bolton's Fray Juan Crespi (1927, repr. 1971), and published in the original Spanish with facing page translations as A Description of Distant Roads: Original Journals of the First Expedition into California, 1769-1770 (2001)Cresp\u00ed, Juan: A Description of Distant Roads: Original Journals of the First Expedition into California, 1769-1770, edited and translated by Alan K. Brown, San Diego State University Press, 2001, provided valuable records of these expeditions. One chapel he built, at the Misi\u00f3n San Francisco del Valle de Tilaco in Landa, is reported as still standing.*Gross, Ernie. This Day in Religion.
