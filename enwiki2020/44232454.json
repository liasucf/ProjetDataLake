    "text": "Ruins is the tenth studio album by American musician Liz Harris under the stage name Grouper. It was released in the United States on October 31, 2014 on Kranky. ==Recording== In a statement accompanying the announcement of the album's release, Liz Harris described its recording process: While in Portugal, where she stayed in a house owned by the aunt of music director S\u00e9rgio Hydalgo, Harris listened to records by Carlos Paredes, Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. Regarding \"Call Across Rooms\", Harris stated that \"the song is on one level very plain and literal, about a letter I wrote for someone I loved and could not get along with. On a more subconscious, poetic level, it is a letter to myself, as aspiration to love better.\" The \"microwave beep\" occurs at the end of \"Labyrinth\". ==Release== On August 14, 2014, Harris announced the album's title. Prior to the album's October 31 release, the tracks \"Call Across Rooms\" and \"Holding\" were released, both of which were awarded Pitchforks \"Best New Track\" status. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, Ruins received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album holds an average score of 80, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 19 reviews. Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork awarded Ruins the site's \"Best New Music\" title and dubbed it \"achingly beautiful and, given the intensely private nature of most of Grouper's work... almost unnervingly direct.\" Ruins was later named the fifth best album of 2014 on Pitchfork. The album also placed 13th in The Wires annual critics' poll. In 2018, Pitchfork ranked Ruins at number 18 on its list of the 30 best dream pop albums. ==Track listing== == References == Category:2014 albums Category:Grouper (musician) albums Category:Kranky albums ",
