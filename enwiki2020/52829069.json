    "text": "Strike is a British television crime drama series based on the Cormoran Strike detective novels written by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The series was first broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2017, after receiving an advance premiere at the British Film Institute on 10 August 2017. The series stars Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private detective operating out of a tiny office in London's Denmark Street, who uses his unique insight and his background as a Special Investigation Branch investigator to solve complex cases that have eluded the police. Burke's casting was confirmed in late 2016, while Holliday Grainger was confirmed to play the role of Robin Ellacott. In early 2017, Kerr Logan was cast in the role of Robin's fianc\u00e9, Matthew. Four adaptations have been broadcast to date, adapting the first four Strike novels: The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015) and Lethal White (2018). The series premiered on 1 June 2018 in the United States on Cinemax and in Canada on HBO Canada under the title C.B. Strike. ==Production== ===Development=== On 10 December 2014, it was announced that the Cormoran Strike novel series, written by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, would be adapted for television by the BBC, for broadcast on BBC One, beginning with The Cuckoo's Calling. Rowling collaborated on the project, and it is believed she contributed to the scripts. Two years later, it was confirmed that the series would total seven episodes of sixty minutes, with shooting to begin in London in the autumn of 2016. Additional scenes were filmed at Barrow in Furness in Cumbria and a petrol station in Leyburn, North Yorkshire. The production filmed at a private house in Sevenoaks in Kent, which featured as the Bristow residence in the episodes \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" and \"The Silkworm\". The Baron's Hall and gardens at Penshurst Place were used for the illustration of scenes in the scandalous Bombyx Mori book, and the Porcupine Cafe features as the cafe on the way to Devon where Cormoran and Robin make a stop. Filming locations also included West London Film Studios. Ben Richards adapted The Cuckoo's Calling, and Tom Edge adapted The Silkworm, Career of Evil and Lethal White. Richards stated that the series is \"very different tonally and visually from other crime dramas\". He compared Strike to the British detective television show Morse. Similarly, Edge commented that \"people use old- fashioned as a pejorative word, but to me that's part of why these books, and, I hope, the TV series, works so well.\" ==Cast and characters== ===Main cast=== * Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike * Holliday Grainger as Robin Ellacott ===Recurring cast=== * Kerr Logan as Matthew Cunliffe * Ben Crompton as \"Shanker\" * Natasha O'Keeffe as Charlotte Campbell * Killian Scott as D.I.
