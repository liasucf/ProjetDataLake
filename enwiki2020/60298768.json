    "text": "Richard Bright Canney (1852 \u2013 17 June 1887) was an English-born cricketer and doctor who practised in New Zealand and Australia. Born in Thanet in Kent, Canney arrived in New Zealand in January 1878. While working as a general practitioner in Wakefield, Canney was selected to captain the Nelson cricket team in its annual first-class match against Wellington in April 1878. He won the toss and, batting in the middle order, scored 7 and 15 \u2013 above-average scores in a match in which 40 wickets fell for 297 runs \u2013 and Nelson won by 85 runs. It was his only first-class cricket match. He moved to Australia in the early 1880s and practised in Scone and then in Gunnedah, where he was highly regarded for his work among the poorer citizens. In March 1887, after he had unsuccessfully operated on a 15-year-old girl at Breeza and she died, he was accused of malpractice. However, the jury not only cleared Canney of malpractice, but in fact commended him for his actions, \"when he knew there was no likelihood of ever being recompensed for his trouble\". On Thursday 16 June 1887 Canney was thrown from his horse in Conadilly Street, Gunnedah, and suffered a fractured skull. He died of his injuries early the next morning. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1852 births Category:1887 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Nelson cricketers Category:People from Thanet (district) Category:English emigrants to New Zealand Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:Australian general practitioners Category:Deaths by horse-riding accident ",
