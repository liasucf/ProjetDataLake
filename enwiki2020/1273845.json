    "text": "This list of the Catholic dioceses and archdioceses of the United States which includes both the dioceses of the Latin Church, which employ the Latin liturgical rites, and various other dioceses, primarily the eparchies of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which employ various Eastern Christian rites, and which are in full communion with the Pope in Rome. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA is not a metropolitan diocese. The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter was established on January 1, 2012 for former Anglicans who join the Catholic Church. Provinces and dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. Each color represents one of the 32 Latin Rite provinces. The Catholic Church in the United States has a total of 196 particular churches -- consisting of 32 territorial archdioceses, 144 territorial dioceses, the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA (serving members of the US Armed Forces and Diplomatic Corps, and those in facilities of the Veterans Administration and their dependents), and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter (serving Catholics who were formerly Anglicans) within the Roman Rite; and two archeparchies and 16 eparchies in the Eastern Catholic Churches -- in the 50 United States and the US Virgin Islands. There are several other dioceses whose territories cover the Nation's unincorporated territories. Puerto Rico has one ecclesiastical province comprising an archdiocese and five dioceses, which together form the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference, which is separate from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.Conferencia Episcopal Puertorrique\u00f1a (C.E.P.). GCatholic.org website. Retrieved 2011-02-13. The dioceses that encompass American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam are part of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific. == Terminology == The pastor of any particular church other than an ordinariate must be episcopally ordained, but his title conforms to that of his jurisdiction: the pastor of an archdiocese is an archbishop, the pastor of a diocese is a bishop, the pastor of an archeparchy is an archeparch, the pastor of an eparchy is an eparch, and the pastor of an exarchate is an exarch. The pastor of an ordinariate, titled the \"ordinary\" (which is a term also used generically for the pastor of any particular church), may be either a bishop if celibate, or a presbyter (priest) if married, but he holds the same power of governance of his ordinariate that a bishop has of his diocese in either case; Pope Benedict XVI deliberately instituted this provision to permit married, former Anglican bishops who come into full communion with the Catholic Church along with many of their congregants to accede to office while respecting sensitivities in ecumenical relations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, which also maintain a celibate episcopacy. The pastor of each particular church is, ex officio, a full member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Auxiliary and retired bishops are also members of the Conference but have no vote. In the United States, each archbishop is also the metropolitan bishop of an ecclesiastical province that encompasses several adjacent dioceses. Likewise, each archeparch is also the metropolitan of an ecclesiastical province that encompasses all of the eparchies of the same sui iuris particular church in the United States. Most provincial and diocesan boundaries conform to state, county, borough (in Alaska), or parish (in Louisiana) political boundaries.For exceptions, see Provincial Boundary Lines. The sui iuris Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the US has an ecclesiastical province consisting of an archeparchy and three eparchies, and the sui iuris Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church has an ecclesiastical province consisting of an archeparchy and three eparchies; the boundaries of these jurisdictions also generally conform to those of states. Most of the remaining eparchies are national in territory, but two particular churches, namely the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Our Lady of Nareg and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, are international, encompassing all of the United States and Canada; their pastors also are ex officio members of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB). In the Roman Rite, (arch)dioceses customarily take the name of the city of the (arch)bishop's cathedra, denominated the \"see\". A few dioceses bear the names of two cities, variously reflecting a shift in the major center of population, e.g., the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston; future plan to divide a diocese, e.g., the former Diocese of Reno-Las Vegas; union of two former dioceses, e.g., the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph; political expedience, e.g., the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis; or a perceived need for some episcopal functions to be accessible to residents of another part of the diocesan territory, e.g., the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown. Some of the sui iuris particular churches also follow this custom, while others denominated their jurisdictions after saints or other religious titles. In the Catholic Church, there are many bishops who do not govern dioceses: * A \"coadjutor\" is appointed to assist the bishop of a diocese or eparchy with its daily governance and has the right of automatic succession upon the death or resignation of the bishop. A coadjutor always holds the title \"Coadjutor of [name of see]\". The coadjutor of an archdiocese or archeparchy also has the status of an archbishop or archeparch. * A retired diocesan bishop holds the title of \"Bishop Emeritus of [name of see]\" or, in the case of an archdiocese, \"Archbishop Emeritus of [name of see]\". * Auxiliary bishops, bishops who govern jurisdictions that are not canonically erected as dioceses, bishops and archbishops of the Roman Curia, and bishops and archbishops of the diplomatic corps of the Holy See have titles of former dioceses and archdioceses. * The Pope also may confer the personal title of \"archbishop\" on a diocesan bishop who does not govern an archdiocese; such a prelate is classified as an archbishop ad personam: although still merely a diocesan bishop, he is titled with the name of a former archdiocese in addition to possessing the title of his own diocese. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, Bishop of Rochester and Titular Archbishop of Neoportus was one of the more famous examples of this custom. When a diocese is suppressed or when the diocesan see is transferred to another location, the title of the former see becomes available for assignment to a titular bishop or, in the case of an archdiocese, a titular archbishop or an archbishop ad personam. The Vatican resurrected the names of many former sees of the United States in the 1990s, as indicated by the table of former dioceses toward the end of this article. == Territorial provinces and dioceses == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !

An archbishop leads it who is presently assisted by four auxiliary bishops. Its status as an \"archdiocese\" is merely honorary. In 1986, Pope John Paul II amended the juridical organization of military chaplaincies from \"military vicariates\" to \"military ordinariates\", the head of which was likened to a diocesan bishop. The Ordinary of the Archdiocese of the Military Services is usually granted the personal title of \"Archbishop\", although this is not a requisite of the office. == Eastern Catholic eparchies == Province of Philadelphia (Ukrainian) The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the United States is organized into a metropolia (province) comprising a metropolitan archeparchy and three suffragan eparchies. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! class=unsortable| Metropolia!! class=unsortable| Map!!

The ordinariate was formed for former Anglicans, including members from the Episcopal Church, Continuing Anglican churches, and Anglican Use parishes. The world's first such ordinariate is the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham of England and Wales. The personal ordinariate for the United States, the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, was instituted on January 1, 2012 in accordance with Anglicanorum Coetibus. It was later expanded to include Canada, and so its ordinary is admitted to the bishops' conference in both countries. * Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter == Former US dioceses == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
