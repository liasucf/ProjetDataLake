The meadow at the Dreibannmarke served as a stopping place for traveling merchants, wagons and craftsmen. With care it is possible to identify traces of the border. After the inauguration of the firing ranges, a meadow in Me\u00dfstetten was allocated as a camping site at the edge of the restricted area. Until 1835 merchandise was smuggled over the customs borders guarded by local hunters. Coffee smuggler Haux had been killed on 21 July 1831 in Pfaffental. On March 1, 1945, Air Force pilot second lieutenant Lothar Sieber died about 7 kilometers south of the Heuberg Military Training Area with the Heuberg barracks, the location of the first manned rocket flight in history. Sieber was piloting a one-man rocket of the type \"Bachem Ba 349 Natter\". ==Mayors== * 1945\u20131957: Dominikus Gallus * 1957\u20131966: Wilhelm Klek * 1966\u20131991 Horst Lupfer * 1991\u20132015: Gregor Hipp (CDU) * since 2015: Maik Lehn (independent) ==Economics== Stetten is a large German Federal Armed Forces location; approximately 2,200 soldiers are stationed in the area, attached to the Heuberg troop exercise area.
