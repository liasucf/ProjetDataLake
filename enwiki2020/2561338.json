    "text": "\"Harmony in My Head\" is a song by Buzzcocks. It was released as a single in 1979, reaching number 32 in the UK Singles Chart. It was written and sung by Steve Diggle. In a 2006 interview with Pitchfork Media, Diggle revealed he had smoked 20 cigarettes to achieve the gruff sound of the vocals. The song title was also used as the name of a radio show hosted by singer Henry Rollins on Indie 103.1. Rollins stated in Fanatic, his book about the radio show's first run that \"Harmony in My Head\" is his favorite Buzzcocks song; appropriately, the Buzzcocks' recording kicked off the first episode of the show. When Rollins relaunched the show after a short hiatus on 27 December 2005, he used a live recording of the same song. ==Track listing== # \"Harmony in My Head\" (Diggle) \u2013 3:06 # \"Something's Gone Wrong Again\" (Shelley) \u2013 4:29 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1979 singles Category:Buzzcocks songs Category:Songs about consumerism ",
