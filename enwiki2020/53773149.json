    "text": "The Blank Palace (Polish: Pa\u0142ac Blanka) is a historic building on ulica Senatorska in Warsaw, Poland. The palace was built by architect Szymon Bogumi\u0142 Zug between 1762 and 1764 for Filip Nereusz Szaniawski. In 1777, ownership was transferred to a Warsaw banker of French descent, Piotr Blank. In the interwar period, the palace served as the residence of the Mayor of Warsaw, Stefan Starzy\u0144ski. It was heavily damaged during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising and was rebuilt between 1947 and 1949. The Blank Palace now houses the Ministry of Sport and Tourism.
