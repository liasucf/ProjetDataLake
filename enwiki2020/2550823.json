This station is licensed to Denver, Colorado and broadcasts at 105.1 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW and is under ownership of Stan Kroenke's KSE Radio Ventures. Its studios are located on Colorado Boulevard in Glendale, and the transmitter is located on Mt. Morrison. ==History== The station began broadcasting in 1956 with the call letters KTGM with a MOR/Beautiful Music format, under the ownership of Good Music Associates. The station was acquired by Sound Corporation of Colorado in 1968, and changed call letters to KADX that same year. As KADX, the station had a MOR format that continued until it was sold to Columbine Broadcasting in 1973, who then flipped it to Jazz that same year. By 1978, it was sold again to Welcome Radio, but kept the Jazz format intact. By 1981, Great Empire Broadcasting added KADX to its portfolio, but would flip the station to Country in 1982 and take the call letters KBRQ, simulcasting its AM sister at 1280. During its tenure and through its numerous ownerships, the station, formats, signal, and its ratings, went unnoticed. On July 3, 1987, KBRQ would switch formats to Oldies and changed call letters to KXKL under the ownership of Shamrock Communications.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-07-10.pdf The format was also simulcast for the next 9 years on 1280 AM. After several ownership changes during the 1990s and 2000s, including Chancellor Media, AM/FM, and Infinity/CBS Radio, Wilks Broadcasting acquired the station in 2008, along with sister stations KIMN and KWOF.CBS to sell three Denver radio stations to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 Mln cash - Update - RTTNews (released December 22, 2008) KXKL continues the Classic Hits format today, playing music from the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s.
