    "text": "Sector is an unincorporated community in Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is located along the west bank of the South Branch Potomac River on Fleming-Sector Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 8/3) across the river from the community of Glebe. Sector grew as a result of its operation of a post office and station on the South Branch Valley Railroad in the early 20th century. On the railroad, it was known as Glebe Station because of its proximity to Glebe. A suspension bridge once connected the two communities via Fleming-Sector Road, but this was repeatedly demolished by a succession of serious floods, most recently in the late 1930s or early 1940s after which it was not rebuilt. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Populated places on the South Branch Potomac River Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:South Branch Valley Railroad ",
