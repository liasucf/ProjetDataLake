Women season was the club's 31st season of competitive football and its 10th season in the FA Women's Super League, the highest level of the football pyramid, having been one of the league's foundation clubs. Along with competing in the WSL, the club also contested two domestic cup competitions: the FA Cup and the League Cup. On 13 March 2020, in line with the FA's response to the coronavirus pandemic, it was announced the season was temporarily suspended until at least 3 April 2020. After further postponements, the season was ultimately ended prematurely on 25 May 2020 with immediate effect. Liverpool sat bottom of the table at the time and were relegated on sporting merit after The FA Board's decision to award places on a points-per-game basis. == Squad == == Pre-season == Liverpool spent part of their preseason on tour in the United States in conjunction with the men's team. == FA Women's Super League == === Results summary === === Results by matchday === === Results === === League table === == Women's FA Cup == As a member of the top two tiers, Liverpool entered the FA Cup in the fourth round, beating Championship side Blackburn Rovers in their opening fixture.
