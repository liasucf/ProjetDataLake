    "text": "thumbnail Auguste-Marseille Barth\u00e9lemy (179623 August 1867), born at Marseilles, was a French satirical poet. His name can hardly be separated from that of his friend and compatriot, Joseph M\u00e9ry (1798\u20131866), with whom he carried on so intimate a collaboration that it is not possible to distinguish their personalities in their joint works. ==Life== After having established some local reputation as a poet, Barth\u00e9lemy went to Paris, where by one of his first efforts, Le Sacre de Charles X (1825) he gained the favor of the court. His energies, however, were soon enlisted in the service of the opposition party. In 1825 appeared a clever political satire, Les Sidiennes, followed by La Vill\u00e9liade ou la prise du ch\u00e2teau de Rivoli (1827), La Corbi\u00e9r\u00e9ide (1827), La Peyronn\u00e9ide, the joint productions of Barth\u00e9lemy and M\u00e9ry. The success was immediate and pronounced; fifteen editions of the Vill\u00e9liade were called for during the year. A rapid succession of political squibs and satires was now poured forth by the authors, among the most remarkable being Biographie des quarante de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (1826) and Napol\u00e9on en \u00c9gypte (1828), which passed through nearly a dozen editions in a year. In 1829 Barth\u00e9lemy was imprisoned and fined 1000 francs for the publication of their Fils de l\u2019homme, a poem on the Duke of Reichstadt, Napoleon's son. The July Revolution of 1830 liberated him; and in company with M\u00e9ry, he celebrated the triumph of the people in one of their most brilliant efforts, L\u2019Insurrection. From March 1831 to April 1832 they produced a series of verse satires issued weekly, the N\u00e9m\u00e9sis, attacking the government and ministers of Louis Philippe. The small pension of which Barth\u00e9lemy was the recipient was stopped. When the publication ceased there was a strong suspicion that Barth\u00e9lemy had been paid for his silence, although a collection of the satires went through several editions in the 1830s. In 1832 he published an anonymous poem, supporting some acts of the government which were peculiarly obnoxious to the liberal faction of the Orl\u00e9anist party. This change of front destroyed his influence and his later writings passed unnoticed. For the next few years he enjoyed a handsome pension from the government and refrained from all satirical writing. He again resumed his old style in 1844. and a collection of 24 satires entitled \"Nouvelle N\u00e9m\u00e9sis\" was published in 1845, but, apparently, without the former success. From that date he contented himself with occasional poems. Barth\u00e9lemy died on 23 August 1867 in Marseilles. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1796 births Category:1867 deaths Category:19th-century French poets Category:People from Marseille Category:French male poets Category:19th- century French male writers ",
