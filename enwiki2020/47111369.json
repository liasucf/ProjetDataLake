    "text": "My Field Trip to Planet 9 is the debut studio album by Justin Warfield. It was released on Qwest Records on July 13, 1993. ==Critical reception== Jason Ankeny of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, \"The hip-hop debut of Justin Warfield is built around old-school rhythms fleshed out with some intriguing samples, drawn largely from the canon of '60s psychedelic rock.\" Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post said, \"[Warfield's] raps, with their tired mix of criminal boasting, gratuitous weirdness and hip-hop cliches, leave almost no impression at all.\" In 2015, Fact placed it at number 43 on the \"50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time\" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Justin Warfield \u2013 vocals, production, mixing * QDIII \u2013 production, mixing * Prince Paul \u2013 production, mixing * Ellis Dee \u2013 vocals * Scott Harding \u2013 guitar, recording, mixing * Goffrey Moore \u2013 bass guitar * Michael Blake \u2013 saxophone * Steven Bernstein \u2013 trumpet * Bob Morse \u2013 recording, mixing * Jason Roberts \u2013 recording * Brian Gardner \u2013 mastering * Kevin Kosmann \u2013 art direction * Anne Elliott Cutting \u2013 photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 debut albums Category:Qwest Records albums Category:Albums produced by Prince Paul (producer) Category:Albums produced by Quincy Jones III Category:Justin Warfield albums ",
