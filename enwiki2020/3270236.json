    "text": "The National Debutante Cotillion and Thanksgiving Ball is an annual dance and formal debutante presentation of young women in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1949 (1) by Miss Mary-Stuart Montague Price, (2) one of the grande dames of Washington society. \u201cStudie,\u201d as she is affectionately known, continues to serve as Chairman Emerita. Hundreds of young ladies, their families, friends, and escorts have \"had a ball\" at Washington\u2019s oldest and most prestigious debutante presentation. (3) Recently, changing customs and raised social consciousness have altered the debutante tradition. In the past, \u201ccoming out parties\u201d were a rite of passage, where young woman were presented to polite society. Today\u2019s Debutante Cotillion is more often a recognition of an already accomplished and assured young woman. Organizers describe today's debutante as a mature, active and involved young woman, striving for success in college and a chosen career. The Washington Post described the Cotillion as \u201cnetworking in a ball gown.\u201d (4) Growing national prominence has broadened the Cotillion\u2019s geographic base. Originally, only area families participated. Today young women from many states travel to Washington to be presented. Regional Chairmen from many states including California, South Carolina, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas recommend young women and their families for participation. Inclusion is by invitation. Since its inception, the Cotillion has always made fundraising for worthy charities a part of its mission. Initially, the Cotillion donated the proceeds of the Ball to the Damon Runyon- Walter Winchell Cancer Fund and then to the Preventative Medicine Institute\u2019s Strang Clinic for the Prevention of Cancer. Since 1979, the Cotillion has benefited the Children\u2019s National Medical Center. The Thanksgiving Ball is famously fun. Guests call themselves members of the \u201cCotillion Family\u201d and often come back for many years, befriending the debutantes and their families, and creating lasting relationships. Debutantes can formally participate in the ball for up to three years, with different colors representing their increasing confidence and sophistication: debutantes wear white, post- debutantes wear black and the post-post debutantes wear red.
