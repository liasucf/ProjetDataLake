Roat\u0103 was representative in the Moldavian ad hoc Divan for the peasant electoral college of Putna County. With Partida Na\u0163ional\u0103, he supported the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Prince of Moldavia, as well as endorsing his elections in Wallachia (leading to the union of the two Danubian Principalities, which eventually occurred on 24 January 1859). At the same time, he campaigned in favor of land reform in Moldavia and Romania at large. Roat\u0103 was known for his personal friendship with Domnitor Cuza and his main supporter, Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu; events involving the three of them are present in a series of anecdotes by Ion Creang\u0103. ==External links== * \"Un vr\u00e2ncean lupt\u0103tor pentru unire - Mo\u015f Ion Roat\u0103\", Ialomi\u0163a, 23 January 2007 Category:People from Vrancea County Category:Members of the Ad hoc Divans Category:1806 births Category:1882 deaths ",
