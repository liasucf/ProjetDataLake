At that time, it was settled by an Aquitanian tribe known to the Romans as the Ausci. Their name for the town was Climberrum\" or Elimberris. This has been tentatively etymologized from the Iberian iltir (\"town, oppidum\") and a cognate of the Basque berri (\"new\"), although another Iberian settlement in Granada recorded by the Romans as \"Iliberi\" probably had no contact with proto-Basque speaking peoples. Following their conquest, the Romans renamed the town Augusta Auscorum or Ausciorum (\"Augusta of the Ausci\"). Augusta Auscorum was one of the twelve civitates of the province of Novempopulana (Gascony) and became the provincial capital after the 409 destruction of Eauze by the Vandals. The common term Augusta was eventually dropped and the name evolved into the modern Gascon Aush and French Auch. The town became the seat of a Catholic archdiocese which lasted until the French Revolution. Its archbishops claimed the title of Primate of Aquitaine, Novempopulana, and Navarre. ==Sites of interest== Auch is known for its Renaissance Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie with its magnificent organ, carved stalls and rose stained-glass windows, La Tour d'Armagnac \u2013 a 14th-century prison, as well as a statue of d'Artagnan who was based on the real life person, Charles de Batz, Comte d'Artagnan born nearby in the ch\u00e2teau de Castelmore, and written about by Alexandre Dumas. == Notable people == Auch was the birthplace of: * Jacques Fouroux (1947\u20132005), rugby union player * Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse (1750\u20131812), admiral * Dominic Serres (1719\u20131793), painter * Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1877\u20131964), Dominican and prominent Neo-Thomist theologian * Nicolas Portal (1979-2020), Professional cyclist for AG2R Pr\u00e9voyance and Director Sportif of World Tour cycling team Ineos (ne Sky) ==Literature== Auch is a location briefly mentioned in the M.
