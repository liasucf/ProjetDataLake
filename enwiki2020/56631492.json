    "text": "Inscription of Quintus Ranius Terentius Honoratianus Festus, . The gens Rania was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens occur in history, but others are known from inscriptions. Lucius Ranius Optatus was consul in the early third century AD.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 641 (\"Ranius\").PIR, vol. III, p. 125. ==Origin== The nomen Ranius resembles other gentilicia formed using the suffix -anius, typically derived from place names and cognomina ending in -anus.Chase, p. 118. No corresponding location or surname is known, but the root of the nomen resembles rana, a frog, and as a cognomen could have belonged to a common class of surnames derived from the names of familiar animals and objects.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. rana.Chase, pp. 112, 113. The Ranii may have been of Sabine extraction, as one of the Ranii bore the surname Sabinus, typically indicating Sabine ancestry, while another family of the name lived at Alba Fucens, in Sabinum.Chase, p. 114. Chase lists Ronius among various gentilicia of Oscan derivation, but this may be a typo for Ranius, as only a single Ronius is known from inscriptions.Chase, p. 128.. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Ranii were Lucius, Gaius, and Quintus, three of the most common names throughout Roman history. Examples of Aulus and Titus are also known. ==Branches and cognomina== The Ranii used a number of surnames, including Felix, fortunate or happy, Fronto, originally applied to someone with a prominent forehead, Pullo, blackish, Sabinus, a Sabine, and Optatus, desired or welcome, the only surname known to have been passed down through a distinct family of the Ranii.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. felix, fronto, pullus, Sabinus, optatus. ==Members== * Ranius, said to have been mentioned by Cicero, perhaps as a slave or freedman of Marcus Junius Brutus; but the text cannot be located, and may perhaps be an error or variant in some manuscript.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xii. 21. * Lucius Ranius Felix, flamen of Augustus at Zama Regia in Africa Proconsularis during the reign of Hadrian.. * Ranius, named in an inscription from Rome.. * Gaius Ranius, a soldier in the century of Gaius Valerius Primus, stationed at Mainz#Roman Mogontiacum in Germania Superior.. * Titus Ranius Fronto, a soldier in the praetorian guard, stationed at Ravenna, was buried at Eleusis in Achaia, aged twenty-six, having served for eight years.
