    "text": "Richard Arnold \"Groove\" Holmes (May 2, 1931 - June 29, 1991) was an American jazz organist who performed in the hard bop and soul jazz genre. He is best known for his 1965 recording of \"Misty\". ==Career== Holmes's first album, on Pacific Jazz with guest Ben Webster, was recorded in March 1961. He recorded many albums for Pacific Jazz, Prestige, Groove Merchant, and Muse, many of them with Houston Person. He died of a heart attack after battling prostate cancer, having performed his last concerts in a wheelchair. One of his last gigs was at the 1991 Chicago Blues Festival with his longtime friend, singer Jimmy Witherspoon. ==Discography== ===As leader=== * \"Groove\" (Les McCann Presents the Dynamic Jazz Organ of Richard \"Groove\" Holmes) [also released as That Healin' Feelin' ] (Pacific Jazz, 1961) \u2013 with Ben Webster * Groovin' with Jug (Pacific Jazz, 1961) \u2013 with Gene Ammons * Somethin' Special (Pacific Jazz, 1962) \u2013 with Les McCann * After Hours (Pacific Jazz, 1961\u20131962) * Tell It Like It Tis (Pacific Jazz, 1961\u20131962 [rel. 1966]) * Book of the Blues Vol. 1 (Warner Bros., 1964) \u2013 with Onzy Matthews' orchestra [note: reissued on Groove Hut (#66707) in 2009] * A Bowl of Soul (Loma/WB, 1966 [rel. 1967]) \u2013 with Onzy Matthews' orchestra [note: reissued on Groove Hut (#66707) in 2009] * Blues For Spoon And Groove (Surrey, 1965) \u2013 with Jimmy Witherspoon [reissued as Groovin' and Spoonin' on Olympic/Everest in 1973] * Soul Message (Prestige, 1965; CD reissue: OJC, 1988) [note: includes the original \"full\u2013length\" version (6:00) of \"Misty\"] * Living Soul (Recorded Live! at Count Basie's) (Prestige, 1966) * On Basie's Bandstand [live] (Prestige, 1966 [rel. 2003]) * Soul Mist!
