    "text": "Wattstown Platform railway station was a short-lived railway station on the now-disused Maerdy Branch in South Wales. ==History and description== The Wattstown goods depot opened in 1885, but a passenger facility did not follow until 1905. The station was not successful, and closed after just fifteen years. Goods activities continued until 7 October 1963. No trace of the station remains, with the trackbed having been reclaimed by nature. Only a road bridge marks the site where the platform once stood.Hutton, J. Taff Vale Miscellany. Oxford Publishing Company. 1988 The site of the goods depot (ST019937) is now occupied by a builder's merchant.Hutton, J. The Taff Vale Railway Volume II.
