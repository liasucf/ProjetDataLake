    "text": "The iHeartRadio MMVAs were an annual awards show broadcast on Much to honour the year's best music videos that was last held in 2018. Originally debuting in 1990 as the Canadian Music Video Awards, the awards were renamed in 1995 to the MuchMusic Video Awards. In 2016, the show was rebranded under the iHeartRadio banner after Much's parent company, Bell Media, reached a licensing agreement with iHeartMedia. In 2018, the show's full name was officially dropped. In 2019, the ceremony was not held; it had been announced that the event was postponed due to scheduling conflicts with other events occurring in Toronto, but no rescheduled date was announced. Bell Media did not announce any plan for a 2020 edition (Much itself had, by then, completely eliminated music programming from its schedule). ==History== ===1990\u20131995: As the Canadian Music Video Awards=== The first Canadian Music Video Awards took place in 1990 on a three-week trip aboard a Canadian National Railway train across Canada. It was sponsored by Diet Pepsi and the train was dubbed \"The Pepsi Train\". Awards were handed out during its journey, which included 10 Canadian cities. ===1996\u20132015: MMVAs=== Logo for the 1999 MuchMusic Video Awards. In their modern form, the MMVAs are held as a large street party around 299 Queen Street West\u2014the main downtown Toronto studios of Much and other properties owned by its parent company Bell Media. Much VJs introduce and interview presenters and winners throughout the show. Winners of a Much Music Video Award receive a statue made by New York firm, Society Awards. Viewers can vote for the Fan Fave category which includes Video, Artist or Group, and International Artist or Group. In 2001, a show was not held due to the September 11 attacks occurring two weeks prior. However, awards were still handed out. All MMVA shows were subsequently held in June until 2017. ===2016\u2013present: iHeartRadio MMVAs=== In 2016, Bell Media signed an exclusive pact with iHeartMedia and began co-branding the awards with iHeartRadio to \"further elevate the MMVAs internationally.\" In 2018, the show moved to August and its full name \"Much Music Video Awards\" was dropped. According to CTV Toronto, Bell Media \"hopes the shift will help establish a new back-to-school event.\" The iHeartRadio MMVAs were not held in 2019 & 2020\\. Bell Media president Randy Lennox told The Canadian Press that the awards were \"delayed\" due to \"a massive concert in August and also the MTV awards were one day after our date, so we didn't think it was smart.\" ==List of Ceremonies== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:100%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year ! style=\"width:5%;\"| Date ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Co- host ! style=\"width:27%;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Video of the Year Winner ! style=\"width:4%;\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- | align=\"center\"| 1990 | | rowspan=\"19\" | \"Sun Comes Up (It\u2019s Tuesday Morning)\" by Cowboy Junkies | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1991 | | \"Superman's Song\" by Crash Test Dummies | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1992 | | \"She La\" by 54-40 | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1993 | | \"Locked in the Trunk of a Car\" by The Tragically Hip | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1994 | | \"Hasn't Hit Me Yet\" by Blue Rodeo | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1995 | | \"Insensitive\" by Jann Arden | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1996 | | \"Ahead by a Century\" by The Tragically Hip | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1997 | | \"Tangerine\" by Moist | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1998 | | \"Broken Bones\" by Love Inc. | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 1999 | | \"Steal My Sunshine\" by Len | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2000 | | \"Load Me Up\" by Matthew Good Band | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2001 | | \"In Repair\" by Our Lady Peace | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2002 | | \"Too Bad\" by Nickelback | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2003 | | \"Innocent\" by Our Lady Peace | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2004 | | \"One Thing\" by Finger Eleven | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2005 | | \"River Below\" by Billy Talent | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2006 | | \"Everyday (Rudebwoy)\" by Kardinal Offishall featuring Ray Robinson | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2007 | | \"Fallen Leaves\" by Billy Talent | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2008 | | \"For the Nights I Can't Remember\" by Hedley | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2009 | | Jonas Brothers | \"Gotta Be Somebody\" by Nickelback | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2010 | | Miley Cyrus | \"Perfect\" by Hedley | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2011 | | Selena Gomez | \"Electric/Night Like This\" by Shawn Desman | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2012 | | LMFAO | \"Call Me Maybe\" by Carly Rae Jepsen | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2013 | | Psy | \"Inner Ninja by Classified featuring David Myles | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2014 | | Kendall Jenner & Kylie Jenner | \"Anything\" by Hedley | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2015 | | Ed Sheeran | \"Often\" by The Weeknd | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2016 | | Gigi Hadid | \"Hotline Bling\" by Drake | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2017 | | Alessia Cara & Joe Jonas | \"R.E.D.\" by A Tribe Called Red featuring Yasiin Bey, Narcy & Black Bear | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| 2018 | | Awkwafina | \"1-800-273-8255\" by Logic featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid | align=\"center\"| |- |} ==Appearances== === Performances === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:100%;\" |- ! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year !
