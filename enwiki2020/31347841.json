    "text": "The National Pantheon was built from 1714-1746 by the Spaniard Geronimo Quezada y Gar\u00e7on and was originally a Jesuit church. The structure was constructed in the neoclassic-renaissance style. Today, the structure stands as a national symbol of the Dominican Republic and serves as the final resting place of the Republic's most honored citizens. ==History== Jesuits held mass here until 1767. After 1767, it was used as a tobacco warehouse and then as the first Dominican theater for purely artistic purposes by the society Amantes de las Letras in 1860 until 1878 when it became theater La Republicana which operated until 1917. It housed governmental offices until 1956. In 1956, Spanish architect Javier Borroso renovated the structure to serve its new purpose as a national mausoleum, by order of then dictator Rafael Trujillo. Originally, Trujillo envisioned being interred at the National Pantheon, yet today it is the place where the country's most famous persons are honored, among others Trujillo's assassins. Other notables that are buried at the National Pantheon include Francisco Gregorio Billini, Gregorio Luper\u00f3n, Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos and Jose Gabriel Garc\u00eda. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in the Dominican Republic Category:Buildings and structures in Santo Domingo Category:Tourist attractions in Santo Domingo Category:Churches completed in 1746 Category:Tobacco buildings Category:Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo) ",
