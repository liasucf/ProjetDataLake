    "text": "Florida () is a municipality of Puerto Rico located north of Ciales, south of Barceloneta, east of Arecibo, and west of Manat\u00ed. Florida is not like other municipalities of Puerto Rico with multiple subdivisions called barrios. It has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two other subdivisions: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal . It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Florida was founded first as a barrio of Barceloneta in 1881 when a priest, Father Carri\u00f3n, the mayor of Barceloneta, and other dignitaries arrived at a terrain of almost 4 acres. They decided to establish a new barrio and the owner of the place, Don Manuel Cintr\u00f3n granted the land while he retained a piece of it. The barrio was first called Florida Adentro. During the 20th century, several efforts were made to declare Florida as a municipality. First, on 14 April 1949, House Representative Francisco D\u00edaz Marchand presented a project to create a legislative commission that would study the economic and social conditions of the barrio, to determine the suitability of it as an independent municipality. The project was unsuccessful. In 1960, Manuel Fr\u00edas Morales presented a law that would permit the study to establish the municipality but it didn't succeed either. Finally, on 14 June 1971, the Senate of Puerto Rico and Governor Don Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 approved the law that officially created the municipality of Florida. It is thus the youngest municipality established in the island. ==Geography== Florida is the second smallest municipality of Puerto Rico, with an area of 10 square miles. The municipality belongs to the coastal plains of the north of Puerto Rico and it's surrounded by small hills. Several caves are formed in the town like Rom\u00e1n Cave, Mir\u00f3 Cave, and Juana G\u00f3mez Cave. Balcon Cave () is located in Florida. ===Barrios=== Florida. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Florida is subdivided into administrative units called barrios (which means barrios or boroughs or neighborhoods in English). A newer municipality of Puerto Rico, Florida has one barrio called Florida Adentro and two subbarrios: Florida Zona Urbana and Pajonal and it does not have a barrio- pueblo like most of the other municipalities of Puerto Rico. The following areas are neighborhoods in Florida: *Parcelas Arroyo *Parcelas Selgas *Pueblo Viejo *San Agust\u00edn *Perol *Tosas ===Sectors=== Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) are subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from sector to urbanizaci\u00f3n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. ===Special Communities === Of the 742 places on the list of (Special Communities of Puerto Rico), the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Florida: Sector El Hoyo in Comunidad San Agust\u00edn, Comunidad Arroyo, Sector Polvor\u00edn in Comunidad La Ceiba, Comunidad La Fuente, Estancias de Arroyo in La Joya, Sector El Cerro in Pajonal, and Sectors La Charca and Los Quemaos (both) in Parcelas Selgas. ==Culture== ===Festival and events=== Florida celebrates its patron saint festival in September.

After its establishment in 1974, the population has steadily increased over the years, with 7,232 people in the 1980 census.

In 1949 and 1960 there were some attempts to separate the barrio from Barceloneta, but these were unsuccessful. However, in 1974, Governor Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 and the Puerto Rican Senate officially declared Florida an independent municipality. Its first mayor was Jorge L. P\u00e9rez Pi\u00f1eiro.
