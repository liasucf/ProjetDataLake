    "text": "Salim Ahmed Ghoush (22 April 1951 \u2013 2 February 2010), better known by his stage name Cochin Haneefa, was an Indian film actor, director, and screenwriter. He started his career in the 1970s mainly portraying villainous roles, before going on to become one of the most popular comedians of Malayalam cinema. He has acted in more than 300 films in Malayalam and Tamil. As a director he is best known for the films Aankiliyude Tharattu (1987) and Vatsalyam (1993). ==Personal life and education== Haneefa was born in Cochin (present-day Kochi) to Kochi Velthedathu Tharavattil A.B. Muhammed and Hajira, as the second among their eight children. He studied at Kochi St. Augustine's School and St. Albert's College and graduated with a degree in commerce. He was married to Fasila. The couple have twins, Safa and Marva. ==Career== He was a member of the famed comedy troupe Cochin Kalabhavan, whose members included Jayaram, Siddique, Lal, Kalabhavan Mani, Harisree Ashokan and Zainudheen. He made his film debut in 1972 in Azhimukham directed by Vijayan and went on to act in over 300 films in Malayalam. He also acted in over 80 Tamil films, including popular movies like Mahanadi with Kamal Haasan, Sivaji and Enthiran with Rajinikanth. Haneefa played memorable roles in many Malayalam films, including Mannar Mathai Speaking, Devaasuram, Kireedam, Chenkol , Punjabi House and Swapnakoodu, Pulivaal Kalyanam etc. He also directed around 20 films, including Valtsalyam and Moonu Masangalkku Munbu. The last Tamil films in which he appeared were Madrasapattinam and Enthiran. His final Malayalam film was the 2010 film Bodyguard. Even though he started off in villain roles, he slowly transitioned to the comedic characters. His comedic roles smartly captured his physique in a self-deprecating nature. He had also played dramatic supporting character roles to a great effect. ==Awards== Kerala State Film Awards: * 2001 \u2013 Second Best Actor \u2013 Soothradharan ==Death== Haneefa died on February 2, 2010, aged 59, at Sri Ramachandra Hospital in Chennai, from multiple organ failure.
