    "text": "Korshamn or Korshavn is a fishing village in the southern part of Lyngdal municipality in Agder county, Norway. The village is located on the island of Rev\u00f8y, located at the mouth of the Gr\u00f8nsfjorden. Korshamn lies about south of the village of Austad. Korshamn Chapel is located in the village, serving the southern part of the municipality. Traditionally, this was just a fishing village, but it now caters to tourists, primarily through the \"Korshamn Rorbuer\" rental cottages. According to Snorre, in the year 1028, King Olaf II (Saint Olaf) made landfall on the island of S\u00e6l\u00f8r, just south of Korshamn with thirteen ships and a thousand men. This event was commemorated by the erection of a sculpture of the king in central Lyngdal, revealed by King Olav V in 1983. In the Rockstar Produced game \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2\u201d, Korshamn is referenced on a newspaper scrap found on one of the settlers of Manzanita Post. ==References== ==External links== *Korshamn Rorbuer *Korshamn.no Weather info, webcam, local pictures Category:Villages in Agder Category:Ports and harbours of Norway Category:Ports and harbours of the North Sea Category:Lyngdal ",
