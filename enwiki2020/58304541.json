However, faced with the success of the college, the building proved too small. A new building was built gradually between 1755 and 1779 to accommodate 100 students. This was the central building of the lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Monod. An important library was also constructed, and parts of it still form the current library at Pau. After the revolution, the religious order were forbidden to enter the college, and it closed in 1793. Over the following years, the building occupied numerous roles: house of detention, war hospital during the war with Spain, and even cotton mill.

In 1978, the building became an annex of the lyc\u00e9e Saint-Cricq in Pau. Finally, the independent lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Monod opened its doors in 1992 after expansion work.
