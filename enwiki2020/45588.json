This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 10th-century Emperor Horikawa and go- (\u5f8c), translates literally as \"later\"; and thus, he is sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Horikawa\". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the \"second one;\" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as \"Horikawa, the second,\" or as \"Horikawa II.\" ==Genealogy== Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina)Brown, pp. 264; n.b., up until the time of Emperor Jomei, the personal names of the emperors (their iminia) were very long and people did not generally use them.

After the Genpei War, he, as the grandson of the late Emperor Takakura, who was also a nephew of the then-exiled Retired Emperor Go-Toba, and Ch\u016bky\u014d's first cousin, was enthroned as Go-Horikawa. He ruled from July 29, 1221 CE to October 26 (?), 1232 CE. * 1221 CE (J\u014dky\u016b 3, 9th day of the 7th month): In the 1st year of what is now considered to have been Ch\u016bky\u014d-tenn\u014d 's reign (\u4ef2\u606d\u5929\u7687\u4e00\u5e74), he abruptly abdicated without designating an heir; and contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (\u2018\u2018senso\u2019\u2019)Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. was received by a grandson of former Emperor Go-Toba.Brown, p. 344; Titsingh, p. 238. * 1221 CE (J\u014dky\u016b 3, 1st day of the 12th month): Emperor Go-Horikawa acceded to the throne (\u2018\u2018sokui\u2019\u2019).Titsingh, p. 95; Brown, p. 344; Varley, p. 44. As Go-Horikawa was only ten-years-old at this time, his father Imperial Prince Morisada acted as cloistered emperor under the name Go-Takakura-in.Titsingh, p. 238; Brown, pp. 344\u2013345; Varley, p. 226. In 1232 CE, he began his own cloistered rule, abdicating to his 1-year- old son, Emperor Shij\u014d. However, he had a weak constitution, and his cloistered rule lasted just under two years before he died.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
