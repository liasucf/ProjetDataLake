    "text": "Henry Colville Montgomery Campbell (11 October 1887 \u2013 26 December 1970) was a Church of England bishop. He was ordained in 1910 and served as vicar or rector in a number of London parishes before being consecrated as a bishop in 1940, holding, successively, the suffragan bishoprics of Willesden and Kensington and the diocesan bishoprics of Guildford and London until his retirement in 1961. ==Early life and ordained ministry== Montgomery Campbell was the son of Sydney Montgomery Campbell, who was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1885 and became vicar of St John's, Hammersmith, and later of Midhurst and Banstead.\"Bishop Montgomery Campbell\", The Times, 28 December 1970, p. 8\"Ordinations\", The Times, 22 December 1885, p. 10; \"Marriages\", The Times, 15 June 1888, p. 1; and \"Ecclesiastical Intelligence\", The Times, 8 June 1905, p. 8 The son was educated at Malvern College and Brasenose College, Oxford. After studying at Wells Theological College he was made deacon in December 1910\"Ordinations\", The Times, 19 December 1910, p. 14 and ordained priest by Edward Talbot, Bishop of Winchester, at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford, on St Thomas's Day 1911 (21 December). His first appointment was a curacy at Alverstoke. In 1916 he married Joyce Mary, daughter of Norman Thicknesse, rector of St George's Hanover Square.\"Marriages, The Times, 13 April 1916, p. 11 After distinguished wartime service in which he received the Military Cross for bravery at Gallipoli, he served as vicar of West Hackney (1919\u201326) and Hornsey (1926\u201333). In the latter post he ran a centre for the unemployed in a building made available to him by the government.\"Ecclesiastical News\", The Times, 6 July 1940, p. 7 From 1929 to 1933 he also held the post of Rural Dean of Hornsey. In 1933, on Thicknesse's retirement, Montgomery Campbell was appointed to succeed him at St George's.\"Ecclesiastical News\", The Times, 5 August 1933, p. 14 ==Episcopal ministry== Montgomery Campbell was appointed to the episcopate as the suffragan Bishop of Willesden in 1940; consecrated a bishop by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 25 July 1940 at St Paul's Cathedral, and translated to be the Bishop of Kensington in 1942\"Ecclesiastical News\", The Times, 5 March 1942, p. 7 (his appointment was announced on 13 March and he must have been translated by the time of his successor's consecration on 25 March). He became a diocesan bishop as Bishop of Guildford in 1949 \u2014 his election was confirmed on 23 November. His diocese was of quite recent creation, having been formed in 1927.\"New Bishop of Guildford\", The Times, 1 December 1949, p. 7 The new cathedral by Edward Maufe was under construction, and the pro-cathedral, Holy Trinity Church, in which Montgomery Campbell was enthroned, was the building in which he had been ordained a priest, 38 years earlier. At first, he was doubtful about the need for a new cathedral, but once he had recognised it as a good thing he backed it enthusiastically. On the retirement of William Wand, Montgomery Campbell became the Bishop of London in 1956, in which position he also became a Privy Councillor. His election to the See was confirmed on 24 January 1956. He became known for his wit, which was sometimes cutting. In the 1990s, his bons mots were recalled in the columns of The Times. On Mervyn Stockwood's appointment to the bishopric of Southwark, he commented, \"I'm taking steps to have the Thames widened\"; and later, when encountering Stockwood who was dressed not in the customary black frock coat and gaiters but in purple cassock and cloak, he greeted him, \"Hello, Mervyn, incognito I see.\"Johnson, Malcolm. \" Bishop's talent for the lofty put-down\", The Times, 28 October 1996. He described Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, as \"a hard man \u2014 he boils his eggs in widows' tears\".Saward, Michael. Letter, The Times, 2 November 1966, p. 23. About to interview an ordinand he said, \"Come in, Brown. Take a chair.\" The young man corrected him: \"Fiennes-Brown, my Lord.\" \"Take two chairs\" was the reply.McRory, Peter. Letter, The Times, 2 November 1966, p. 23. Commenting on his predecessors and successors at Guildford he said, \"The first Bishop of Guildford went out of his mind, the second had no mind to go out of, then they had me, then a saint, and now they have started all over again.\" At his enthronement as Bishop of London he banged ceremonially with his crosier on the great West door of St Paul's, which there was some delay in opening. He turned to his chaplain and said, \"We've come to the wrong place\". When the door was finally opened revealing the aged canons of the cathedral, he commented, \"The See gives up its dead\". A modest man, he called himself \"one who is no figure in public life and no scholar, but simply and solely a Father in God who goes round the parishes visiting the chaps \u2013 the only thing I am any good at\". His obituarist in The Times commented that this was an underestimate of Montgomery Campbell's abilities, and that he was \"a wise and discerning administrator, who could quickly grasp the essentials of a situation and impart to it his own sure touch. He was at heart a man of prayer and great dedication.\" Montgomery Campbell retired effective 31 July 1961. He died at the age of 83 in Westminster Hospital on 26 December 1970 having contracted bronchial pneumonia after falling during a power cut and fracturing his thigh.\"Bishop's death after power cut\", The Times, 7 January 1971, p. 1 The funeral was a quiet service at St Stephen's, Westminster on 31 December, and he was buried at Wivelsfield, Sussex. A memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral the following month. He was predeceased by his wife, who died in 1928; he was survived by their four daughters and one son. ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ===External links=== * Newsreel footage of Montgomery-Campbell's enthronement at St Paul's * Newsreel footage of the re-consecration of St Clement Danes Category:1887 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Wells Theological College Category:Bishops of Guildford Category:People from Fulham Category:Bishops of Kensington Category:Bishops of London Category:Deans of the Chapel Royal Category:Bishops of Willesden Category:Doctors of Divinity Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Recipients of the Military Cross ",
