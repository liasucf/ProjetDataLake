    "text": "Inverna Lockpez (born November 21, 1941) is a Cuban American feminist, painter, sculptor, and activist, that actively participated in the second wave of America's feminist movement. She is known for her graphic novel Cuba: My Revolution (illustrated by Dean Haspiel), a fictionalized memoir of her life prior to coming to the United States. == Biography == Inverna Lockpez was born in Havana, Cuba Growing up, Lockpez yearned to be an artist although her mother wanted her to follow behind her father\u2019s footsteps as a doctor. However, in 1959, after Fidel Castro overthrows previous Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, Lockpez decided to set aside art and pursue a career in medical studies in order to help Castro\u2019s militia as a doctor. During the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, Lockpez volunteers as a medic to go to the front-lines to help the Cubans fight the Americans. There, Lockpez helped an injured CIA prisoner and is arrested for conspiracy. While in prison, Lockpez is tortured repeatedly by her own comrades. After three months, Lockpez is released from prison and begins to focus on art once again. On September 1965, Lockpez\u2019s art exhibition was opened to the public, however, riots started to form because her art did not fall under the category approved by Fidel Castro. Lockpez\u2019s artwork was confiscated and she was forced to hide. After receiving her travel visa, Lockpez left Cuba in September, 1966 and arrived in the United States. After settling in New York, Lockpez attended the School of Social Work at Columbia University. In 1969, she attended her first exhibition in the United States: the Woodstock Music Festival. This influenced her to exhibit her own art in the 1970 all-female art exhibition \u201cX12.\u201d Shortly after, Lockpez joined the NYC Women Artists in Revolution, an organization that protests against museums and galleries that do not portray female artists in their exhibitions and shows. During the 1970s, Lockpez primarily focused on sculptures, and in 1972, her 25-foot sculpture \u201cWalking Pineapples\u201d won the outdoor competition of The Municipal Art Society. However, her artwork was met with much controversy because New York at the time was mainly influenced by minimalist and conceptual art. In 1978, she became the director of INTAR Gallery, NYC, which focused on exhibiting the work of artists with multiracial heritages. She attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and studied film, video, and computer graphics. Her art reflected themes of ecology and the welfare of the environment. In 1985, Lockpez began her series \u201cMarkings of the Land\u201d after she moved to a farmhouse in Delaware County. Her art was mainly black and white and its artistic features were of mountains and animal iconography. From 1982 to 1993, Lockpez curated or produced a series of feminist art exhibits in New York City; her most prominent being the 1993 portfolio for Heresies, issue #27. In 1988, Lockpez assumed role of President for the National Association of Artists\u2019 Organizations (NAAO). Years later, in 2001, she became the director of the Catskill Center\u2019s Erpf Gallery in Arkville and in 2008, Lockpez wrote a novel of her experiences from her time in Cuba. In 2010, Cuba: My Revolution was published by DC Comics/Vertigo, documenting her struggles from her time during the Cuban Revolution until her eventual coming to America. Currently, Lockpez lives in Florida and is working on her new series of works, entitled Avian Impressions and The Boat Run. == Education == Lockpez attended medical school at the University of Havana, then she studied painting and sculpture at the National Academy of San Alejandro. Afterwards, she studied printmaking at Taller de Grabado. Lockpez attended the School of Social Work at Columbia University once she came to the United States and later in the 1980s, she attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. == Artworks == Ms. Lockpez exhibited a 15-foot sculpture, titled Ms. in New York City in 1973. This was the first time the word \"Ms.\" was used as a title for a woman in a public exhibition. Lockpez displayed this artwork at the political show titled Women Choose Women in order to demonstrate the artwork woman artists are able to create. Walking Pineapples For the 1974 CESP project, Lockpez created a foam board sculpture titled \"Walking Pineapples.\" Lockpez's project was a three-curved shaped structure of graduated height. Each was segmented into black-outlined parts of tropical oranges, yellows, pinks, and greens, with addition three-dimensional shapes. The curve of the sculpture and counter-curve gave the ensemble the look of a pineapple. Lockpez used urethane foam blocks, laminated polyester, and fiberglass sheeting to create her 25-foot sculpture. To complete the entire sculpture, Lockpez spent $6,800 on materials. Untitled Lockpez's 1975, Untitled, features a three-dimensional paper and foam sculpture of what seems to be a volcano. It is a black-and- white visual art that portrays the volcano separating into three different parts, representing the different types of rocks that are found during an volcanic explosion. The Green Barn Lockpez completed her oil on canvas painting in 2000. It features a dark green barn with a dark green tree to its left, in a snowy setting. The dark color of the barn and tree contrasts with the white snow, which gives the artwork a blurry, but grandiose accomplishment. This painting was featured in Lockpez's 2008 gallery titled The Noble Barn. == Exhibitions == In 1976, she exhibited several 12-foot, three-dimensional works in the first feminist exhibition titled X12. The exhibition group later merged with the NYC Women Artists in Revolution, a group which organized demonstrations against museums and galleries that did not exhibit the work of female artists. Lockpez also participated in multiple political shows. The first one she was involved in was The Flag Show, an anti- Vietnam show at the Judson Memorial Church. She was also a part of Women Choose Women, in which she displayed her art, \"Ms.\" The MOD ART at the Public Theater in New York City was in part with one of the first feminist music plays, and in 1981, Lockpez also took part in directing the controversial play: My Sister in This House. The last political show she was involved in was the Erotic Garden at the Women's interart Center in New York in which artists reclaimed their sexuality in visual terms.Torruella, Leval S, Ricardo Pau- Llosa, and Inverna Lockpez.
