    "text": "The Blessed Hellride is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Black Label Society. It contains a mix of heavy (\"Stoned and Drunk\", Stillborn) and lighter (\"The Blessed Hellride\", \"Dead Meadow\") tracks. The second track \"Doomsday Jesus\" was featured on the soundtrack to the video game MTX Mototrax, but with altered lyrics. The third track, \"Stillborn\", is featured on the soundtrack of the game Guitar Hero: World Tour. Frontman Zakk Wylde was also a playable celebrity rockstar in that same game. Ozzy Osbourne appears on the first single, \"Stillborn\", though his name was not used to promote the track. He is credited inside the booklet, however, due to Osbourne being on Sony Records at the time, Spitfire Records were not allowed to promote this song with Osbourne's name - a sticker on the cover of the album said \"featuring special guest star\". The Japanese bonus track \"F.U.N.\" is a joke song, presumably recorded while Wylde and Craig Nunenmacher were horsing around in the studio. The song's lyrics poke fun at the cheesiest of the 1980s hairband's \"party\" lyrics; Wylde himself noted that \"parody\" would be a charitable term, saying \"That song is so ridiculous, I don't think you could mock anybody... No one sucks that much.\" A song called \"No Other\" was recorded, mixed, and mastered for this album, however, it remained unreleased until the next album, \"Hangover Music Vol. VI.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Zakk Wylde. #\"Stoned and Drunk\" \u2013 5:02 #\"Doomsday Jesus\" \u2013 3:30 #\"Stillborn\" (feat.
