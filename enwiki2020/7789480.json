    "text": "\"Block Rockin' Beats\" is a song by British big beat duo The Chemical Brothers. It was released as the second single from their second album, Dig Your Own Hole, in March 1997. The single topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 40 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. There are two different edits of \"Block Rockin' Beats\" available; one is the version found on Dig Your Own Hole, which has an intro, and the other version begins with the bassline. The B-side \"Morning Lemon\" is also available on the second disc of the limited edition Singles 93\u201303. Blender listed the song on number 346 on its ranking of \"Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\" in 2005. LA Weekly put it at number 14 in their list of \"The 20 Best Dance Music Tracks in History\" in 2015. ==Samples== The drums are sampled from \"Changes\" by Bernard Purdie. The vocals, \"Back with another one of those block rockin' beats\" is a sample from American rapper Schoolly D's 1989 song \"Gucci Again\". Another reviewer opines that the track uses (without compensation) the bassline from the track \"Coup\" by 23 Skidoo. The opening bass riff resembles the intro from the Pink Floyd song \"Let There Be More Light\", while the bass sound has been sampled from The Crusaders' song \"The Well's Gone Dry\".Look for equal entries in WhoSampled's page for Block Rockin\u2019 Beats and the one for B-Boy Bouillabaisse, for the latter song is using apparently the same sample. \"Morning Lemon\" opens with a vocal sample of a man singing \"Morning lemon\", and ends with a sample of Ice Cube saying \"Take that, motherfuckers!\" (from his song \"What They Hittin' Foe?\"). ==Critical reception== BBC noted, \"Not only was the song an undeniable earworm, but it took the art of sampling to a new level - borrowing its drums from Bernard Purdie and its vocals from US rapper Schoolly D. There have even been suggestions that the track covertly samples Pink Floyd too.\" Larry Flick from Billboard described the track as \"a genre-spanning revelation\" and commented further that \"After one spin, you'll be chanting the hook for hours, and the blend of scratchy funk beats and acidic keyboards are sure to get the body moving.\" Complex said that \"there was something about the combined fury of that Schoolly D vocal sample, that hypnotic bassline and those big drums that turned this one into an anthem for the breakbeat set.\" Terri Sutton from Salon called it \"incorrigible\" with its \"frantic faux guitar interplay, funky bass and underwater detonations.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1997) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |12 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |2 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Singles Sales (Billboard) |11 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1997) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |52 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) |77 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |88 |} ==Certifications== ==In popular culture== *The track was featured in the 1998 comedy The Waterboy, during the scene when Bobby Boucher (played by Adam Sandler) plays football for the first time. *\"Block Rockin' Beats\" was used in the 2003 Ongoing History of New Music episode \"Alt-Rock's Greatest Instrumentals\". *The song was featured in the soundtrack to Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. *In 2018, it appeared in a television advertisement for the PlayStation Classic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 singles Category:Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance Category:UK Singles Chart number- one singles Category:The Chemical Brothers songs Category:1997 songs Category:Astralwerks singles Category:Songs written by Tom Rowlands Category:Songs written by Ed Simons ",
