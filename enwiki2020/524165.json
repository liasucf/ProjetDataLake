    "text": "A suicide note or death note is a message left behind when a person dies by suicide, or intends to die by suicide. A study examining Japanese suicide notes estimated that 25\u201330% of suicides are accompanied by a note. However, incidence rates may depend on ethnicity and cultural differences, and may reach rates as high as 50% in certain demographics. A suicide message can be in any form or medium, but the most common methods are by a written note, an audio message, or a video. ==Reasons== Some fields of study, such as sociology, psychiatry and graphology, have investigated the reasons why people who complete or attempt suicide leave a note. According to Lenora Olsen, a professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine, the most common reasons that people contemplating suicide choose to write a suicide note include one or more of the following: * To ease the pain of those known to the victim by attempting to dissipate guilt. * To increase the pain of survivors by attempting to create guilt. * To set out the reason(s) for suicide. * To express thoughts and feelings that the person felt unable to express in life. * To give instructions for disposal of the remains. * Occasionally, to confess acts of murder or some other offence. Sometimes there is also a message in the case of murder\u2013suicide, explaining the reason(s) for the murder(s), see for example, Marc L\u00e9pine's suicide statement and videotaped statements of the 7 July 2005 London bombers. ==Notable people who left suicide notes== * Leelah Alcorn\u2014American transgender teenage girl who was forced to undergo conversion therapy by her Christian parents. * Desmond Amofah\u2014American Internet personality who was known by his online alias \"Etika\".
