The convent presently functions as a warehouse.

Priests of the Servite order arrived to Pistoia by 1241, and moved here to a house with a small oratory titled Santa Maria Novelleta and located just outside the gates of the Porta San Piero.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): page 238. By 1270-1271 construction of a convent and church had begun. Initially, the Servites were affiliated with San Pietro Maggiore in town, but by 1296, a new larger church at the site was underway, not completed until 1393.Tigri, page 238. The original consecration to Santa Maria de\u2019 Servi was altered in 1537 to the Santissima Annunziata. In the 17th century, the church was refurbished and decorated with Baroque frescoes and stucco. In 1786, the convent was suppressed by the Bishop Ricci, but recruited again as a monastery by 1794. In 1810, the Napoleonic forces again suppressed the convent. The church was made into a parish until 1856, when the Servites briefly returned, only to be again suppressed in Pistoia this time by the Italian kingdom, turning the convent into barracks. The cloister retains 17th-century frescoes depicting the history of the Servite order.Diocese of Pistoia, entry on parish history.Comune of Pistoia, entry on church. ==Description== The organ present in 1853 was made by Filippo Tronci.
