    "text": "In metric geometry, an injective metric space, or equivalently a hyperconvex metric space, is a metric space with certain properties generalizing those of the real line and of L\u221e distances in higher-dimensional vector spaces. These properties can be defined in two seemingly different ways: hyperconvexity involves the intersection properties of closed balls in the space, while injectivity involves the isometric embeddings of the space into larger spaces. However it is a theorem of Aronszajn and Panitchpakdi (1956; see e.g. ) that these two different types of definitions are equivalent. == Hyperconvexity == A metric space X is said to be hyperconvex if it is convex and its closed balls have the binary Helly property. That is, #any two points x and y can be connected by the isometric image of a line segment of length equal to the distance between the points (i.e. X is a path space), and #if F is any family of closed balls ::{\\bar B}_r(p) = \\\\{q \\mid d(p,q) \\le r\\\\} :such that each pair of balls in F meet, then there exists a point x common to all the balls in F. Equivalently, if a set of points pi and radii ri > 0 satisfies ri + rj \u2265 d(pi,pj) for each i and j, then there is a point q of the metric space that is within distance ri of each pi. == Injectivity == A retraction of a metric space X is a function \u0192 mapping X to a subspace of itself, such that # for all x, \u0192(\u0192(x)) = \u0192(x); that is, \u0192 is the identity function on its image (i. e. it is idempotent), and # for all x and y, d(\u0192(x), \u0192(y)) \u2264 d(x, y); that is, \u0192 is nonexpansive. A retract of a space X is a subspace of X that is an image of a retraction. A metric space X is said to be injective if, whenever X is isometric to a subspace Z of a space Y, that subspace Z is a retract of Y. == Examples == Examples of hyperconvex metric spaces include * The real line * Any vector space Rd with the L\u221e distance * Manhattan distance (L1) in the plane (which is equivalent up to rotation and scaling to the L\u221e), but not in higher dimensions * The tight span of a metric space * Any real tree * Aim(X) - see Metric space aimed at its subspace Due to the equivalence between hyperconvexity and injectivity, these spaces are all also injective. == Properties == In an injective space, the radius of the minimum ball that contains any set S is equal to half the diameter of S. This follows since the balls of radius half the diameter, centered at the points of S, intersect pairwise and therefore by hyperconvexity have a common intersection; a ball of radius half the diameter centered at a point of this common intersection contains all of S. Thus, injective spaces satisfy a particularly strong form of Jung's theorem. Every injective space is a complete space , and every metric map (or, equivalently, nonexpansive mapping, or short map) on a bounded injective space has a fixed point (; ). A metric space is injective if and only if it is an injective object in the category of metric spaces and metric maps. For additional properties of injective spaces see . == References == * Correction (1957), Pacific J. Math. 7: 1729, . * * * * * Category:Metric geometry ",
