    "text": "The Daydreamer (originally known by its working title: The Enchanted World of Hans Christian Andersen) is a 1966 stop motion animated\u2013live action musical fantasy film produced by Videocraft International. Directed by Jules Bass, it was written by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Romeo Muller, based on the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. It features seven original songs by Jules Bass and Maury Laws. The film's opening features the cast in puppet and live form plus caricatures of the cast by Al Hirschfeld. Among the cast were American actors Paul O'Keefe, Jack Gilford, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton (both from Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz), and Australian actor Cyril Ritchard as the voice of the Sandman. Some of the character voices were recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto, Ontario, under Bernard Cowan's supervision. The \"Animagic\" puppet sequences were staged by Don Duga at Videocraft in New York, and supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at MOM Production in Tokyo, Japan. The film was Videocraft's first theatrical feature production to be distributed by Embassy Pictures, located in Los Angeles, California and headed by executive producer Joseph E. Levine. Embassy Pictures later theatrically releases the company's two other films in 1967, Mad Monster Party? and The Wacky World of Mother Goose. As an association with Rankin and Bass, Ritchard also made his voice appearance in three of their studio's other animated productions: The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye: The Emperor's New Clothes in 1972, The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow in 1975, and The Hobbit in 1977 (his final film role shortly before his death). ==Plot== A teenaged Hans Christian Andersen the son of a poor shoemaker,daydreams instead of studying for school. He runs away from home. Whenever he falls asleep, he dreams that he is in strange adventures with tailors, a tiny girl no bigger than a thumb, a mermaid, a devil boy in Eden, and others. In reality, as well as in his dreams, Hans is searching for the Garden of Paradise, which he does not find. The dream sequences are puppet animation, complete with a puppet version of himself. These dreams become the basis for his fairy tale fictions, which he writes as an adult: \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Thumbelina\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", \"Little Claus and Big Claus\", and \"The Garden of Paradise\". ==Musical numbers== #\"Daydreamer\" \u2013 Robert Goulet #\"Overture\" \u2013 Maury Laws #\"Wishes and Teardrops\" \u2013 The Little Mermaid #\"Simply Wonderful\" \u2013 The Emperor and His Three Minstrels #\"Who Can Tell\" \u2013 The Pieman of Odense #\"Luck to Sell\" \u2013 Chris #\"Happy Guy\" \u2013 Thumbelina, Chris and Chorus #\"Isn't It Cozy?\" \u2013 Three Bats and the Mole #\"Finale (The Daydreamer)\" \u2013 Chorus ==Cast== *Paul O'Keefe as \"Chris\" (Hans Christian Andersen) *Jack Gilford as Papa Andersen *Margaret Hamilton as Mrs. Klopplebobbler *Sessue Hayakawa as The Mole *Patty Duke as Thumbelina *Boris Karloff as The Rat *Hayley Mills as The Little Mermaid *Burl Ives as Father Neptune *Tallulah Bankhead as The Sea Witch *Victor Borge as The Second Tailor *Ed Wynn as The Emperor *Ray Bolger as The Pieman *Cyril Ritchard as The Sandman *Terry-Thomas as The First Tailor *Robert Harter as Big Claus the game warden ===Additional voices=== *Billie Mae Richards *Larry D.
