    "text": "Joseph Talbot (born 23 August 1984) is a Welsh musician from Exeter, England. He has been the vocalist for rock band Idles since their inception in 2009. ==Early years== Talbot was born in Newport, Wales and raised in Exeter, England. He met Idles bassist Adam Devonshire at sixth form college in Exeter, before moving to Bristol alongside Devonshire, where they studied at the St Matthias Campus of the University of the West of England and decided to start a band.Hamilton, Joe (2017) \"Brute Force: The Contrary World Of IDLES\", Clash, 15 March 2017. Retrieved 8 July 2017 Following university, they went on to open the now-defunct Bat-Cave Night Club in Bristol. When he was 16, Talbot's mother had a stroke and was paralyzed, and after the death of his step-father, he became her primary caretaker, until her death in 2015. Her passing was followed two years later by the stillbirth of his daughter Agatha Talbot. Talbot's mother and first daughter are primary subjects of Brutalism and Joy as an Act of Resistance respectively. ==Music career== Talbot has released three studio albums and many EPs and singles with Idles. His music has been described as punk rock, and post-punk, especially due to its passionate nature and political lyrics, which have criticized right-wing news networks such as Fox News and The Sun, and outlined social issues such as depression, white privilege, and toxic masculinity. However, Talbot has rejected all of these genre labels. In 2017, he was quoted saying: \"We're not a post-punk band. I guess we have that motorik, engine-like drive in the rhythm section that some post-punk bands have but we have plenty of songs that aren't like that at all.\"Murray, Eoin (2017) \"Stendhal Syndrome: Idles Interviewed\", The Quietus, 29 June 2017. Retrieved 8 July 2017 At a 2018 concert in Manchester, he said: \"for the last time, we're not a fucking punk band\".McCann, Freya (2018) \"LIVE: IDLES @ O2 RITZ | 19.10.18\", Mcr.live, 19 October 2018.
