    "text": "A three-ingredient cocktail is a cocktail that can be made with as few as three ingredients. The technical, 19th-century definition of a cocktail stated that it should consist solely of three ingredients: spirit, sweetener, and bitters. Sours consisting of spirit, sweetener, and citrus are another kind of three-ingredient cocktail. An advantage of many such cocktails is the relative ease of making them, particularly at home, compared to cocktails with longer lists of ingredients. ==Examples== *Batanga (tequila, lime juice, and Coca- Cola) *Bee's Knees (gin, lemon juice, honey syrup) *Blinker (rye whiskey, grapefruit juice, grenadine) *Cosmonaut (gin, lemon juice and raspberry preserves) *Dry martini (London dry gin, dry vermouth, orange bitters) *Harvey Wallbanger (vodka, Galliano, and orange juice) *Irish mule (Irish whiskey, ginger ale, lime juice) *Manhattan (rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, Angostura bitters) *Margarita (tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice) *Moscow mule (vodka, ginger beer, lime juice) *Negroni (London dry gin, sweet vermouth, Campari) *Paloma (tequila, lime juice, grapefruit soda) *Pi\u00f1a colada (rum, pineapple juice, cream of coconut)https://skillet.lifehacker.com/unwind-with-a-pina- colada-1834511008? *Sea Breeze (vodka, cranberry juice, grapefruit juice) *The Japanese (cognac, orgeat, bitters) ==See also== *Two-ingredient cocktail ==References== Category:Three-ingredient cocktails ",
