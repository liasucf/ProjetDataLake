The chief executive's powers and functions include leading the government, implementing the law, signing bills and budgets passed by the Legislative Council, deciding on government policies, advising appointment and dismissal of principal officials of the Government of Hong Kong to the Central People's Government (State Council), appointing judges and holders of certain public offices and to pardon or commute sentences. The position is also responsible for the policy address made to the public. The chief exeutive's powers and functions are established by article 48 of the Basic Law. The Executive Council of Hong Kong is an organ for assisting the chief executive in policy-making. The council is consulted before making important policy decisions, introducing bills to the Legislative Council, making subordinate legislation or dissolving the Legislative Council. ===Resignation=== Article 52 stipulates circumstances under which the chief executive must resign. Examples include the loss of ability to discharge his or her duties or refusal to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council. ===Acting and succession=== The acting and succession line is spelled out in article 53. If the chief executive is not able to discharge his or her duties for short periods (such as during overseas visits), the duties would be assumed by the chief secretary for administration, the financial secretary or the secretary for justice, by rotation, in that order, as acting chief executive. In case the position becomes vacant, a new chief executive would have to be selected. ===Residence and office=== Government House, official residence of the chief executive Prior to the handover in 1997, the office of the chief executive-designate was at the 7th floor of the Asia Pacific Finance Tower.Legco.gov.hk. \"HEAD 21 \u2013 CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE.\" Retrieved on 28 March 2010.

Retrieved on 28 March 2010. In the past the governor had his office at Government House. Tung did not use Government House as the primary residence because he lived at his own residence at Grenville House. Donald Tsang decided to return to the renovated Government House during his first term, and moved in on 12 January 2006, for both his office and residence. In 2011, the office of the chief executive moved to the low block of the new Central Government Complex in Tamar. Government House continues to serve as the official residence of the chief executive. ==Former chief executives== Upon retirement, former chief executives have access to office space at the Office of Former Chief Executives, 28 Kennedy Road. The office provides administrative support to former chief executives to perform promotional, protocol-related, or any other activities in relation to their former official role.

Former chief executives also enjoy medical and dental care. Former chief executives hold the title \"The Honourable\", and ranks third in the Hong Kong order of precedence. ==Remuneration== Remuneration for the chief executive of Hong Kong is among the highest in the world for a political leader, and only second to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The pay level took a cue from the handsome amounts paid to the city's colonial governors \u2013 worth $273,000 per annum plus perks in 1992. In 2005, Tung Chee Hwa received some HK$3 million ($378,500) in pay as chief executive. From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22 million. In January 2015, CY Leung reversed a pay freeze imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61 million ($591,000). In July 2017, Directors of Bureau (DoBs) were approved to have a 12.4% pay rise and the 3.5% pay differential between Secretaries of Departments (SoDs) and DoBs remained, indicating a new annual pay of approximately HK$5 million for the city's leading role because the chief executive received a salary of 112% of the chief secretary, which means that the new salary of the chief executive of Hong Kong is about thirty-nine times more than the current annual salary of the president of China. == Criticism of the office == Since the chief executive is directly appointed by the Central People's Government after an election by a committee of 1,200 people selected by the Central People's Government, rather than the general population, many people, in particular the pro-democrats, have criticised the office as undemocratic, and have criticised the entire election process as a \"small-circle election.\" Former Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa has even stated that the election's result is a non- binding one.\"Beijing won\u2019t appoint winner of chief executive race if it finds candidate \u2018unacceptable\u2019, elder statesman Tung Chee-hwa warns\" Tung Chee-hwa in South China Morning Post 20 Jul, 2018 Many events, including 2010 events such as the Five Constituencies Referendum have attempted to push for greater democracy and universal suffrage. In January 2015, when CY Leung reversed a pay freeze imposed on the chief executive and senior civil servants in 2012, he was accused of granting himself a pay rise by stealth and going against the trend of top politicians taking pay cuts instead of pay increases. ==List of chief executives of Hong Kong== Political party: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !
