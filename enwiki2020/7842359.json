    "text": "Du glucose pour No\u00e9mie, written and drawn by Fournier, is the twentyfirst album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the author's second, following the Spirou retirement of Andr\u00e9 Franquin. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine before it was published, along with the short story Un faux d\u00e9part, as a hardcover album in 1971. ==Story== In Glucose for No\u00e9mie, the story continues where Le champignon nippon of the previous album left off. Ito Kata, a well-known Japanese conjuror, has entrusted Spirou and Fantasio with a special mushroom which he wants them to take back to their friend the Count of Champignac, a leading mycologist. The mushroom is also coveted by the Triangle, a SPECTRE-like, world-spanning criminal organization. Having escaped the Triangle's agents, Spirou and Fantasio stand stunned at Tokyo airport when they find the parcel they were transporting empty... In A False Departure, Spip is determined to run away from home. ==Background== This album offers no explanation of Marsupilami's sudden absence (see Le faiseur d'or). Ito Kata would become a regular secondary character during Fournier's run on the series. ==References== * Fournier publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es ==External links== * Spirou official site album index Glucose pour Noemie, Du Category:Works originally published in Spirou (magazine) Category:Literature first published in serial form Category:1971 books Category:1971 in comics Category:Comics set in Japan Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ",
