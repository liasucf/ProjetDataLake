Exarch Maximos was elevated to the honour of Archimandrite in 1953 for his successful church administration. During Anti-Greek riots in 1955 (Istanbul pogrom), the Melkite Church building in Istanbul was destroyed. Because Archimandrite Maximos was not a Turkish citizen, he had to leave Istanbul and went to the United States.Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Turkey ==References== ==External links== * Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Turkey * Melkite Greek Catholic Church: Patriarchal Exarchate of Istanbul Istanbul Category:Eastern Catholic dioceses in Europe Category:Eastern Catholicism in Turkey Category:Catholic Church in Turkey Category:Christianity in Istanbul Category:Organizations based in Istanbul ",
