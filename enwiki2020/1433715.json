The New Zealand Infantry Corps war granted royal status in July 1947. In August 1947 the New Zealand Regiment was reorganised with the two Infantry Battalions in Jayforce joining the New Zealand Regiment: *1st Battalion \u2013 re-designation of original regiment *2nd Battalion \u2013 re-designation of 22nd Battalion, NZEF *3rd Battalion \u2013 re-designation of 27th Battalion, NZEF The 2nd and 3rd Battalions were disbanded in 1948 following their return to New Zealand. During 1948 amalgamations further reduced the TF Infantry Regiments to nine; * The North Auckland Regiment, * The Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own)Regiment, * The Hauraki Regiment, * The Wellington and West Coast and Taranaki Regiment, * The Hawke's Bay Regiment, * The Wellington (City of Wellingtons Own) Regiment, * The Nelson, Marlborough and West Coast Regiment, * The Canterbury Regiment, * The Otago Regiment and Southland Regiment., ===Malaya=== On 2 August 1957, official authority was granted to raise and train the first \"Regular\" Infantry Battalion in New Zealand history. Under the command of Lt-Col W. R. K. Morrison DSO, the 1st New Zealand Regiment would be New Zealand's land force commitment to the British Commonwealth Far East Reserve, The 1st Battalion, The New Zealand Regiment was deployed to Malaya from October 1957 as part the 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group. Between 1958 and 1964 the NZ Regiment would rotate 3 Battalions through Malaya; * 1st Battalion NZ Regiment, (1957 to 1959) * 2nd Battalion NZ Regiment, (1959 to 1961) * 1st Battalion NZ Regiment, (1961 to 1963) * 2nd Battalion NZ Regiment, (1963 to 1965) - 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment was formed on 1May64 This deployment would be unique in New Zealand military history, as it would be the first time that families would accompany a New Zealand overseas military deployment to an overseas location. In 1963 the 2nd Battalion now based in New Zealand was reorganised as a Depot for the 1st Battalion (??-DB). === Infantry reorganization === On 1 April 1964 all units of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Corps were reorganised into the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment and re-designated as; *1 RNZIR - 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (Regular) *2 RNZIR - 2nd Battalion, (Canterbury, and Nelson- Marlborough and West Coast), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *3 RNZIR - 3rd Battalion, (Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and Northland), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *4 RNZIR - 4th Battalion, (Otago and Southland), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *5 RNZIR - 5th Battalion, (Wellington West Coast and Taranaki), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *6 RNZIR - 6th Battalion, (Hauraki), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *7 RNZIR - 7th Battalion, (Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay), Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment === Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation === During the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation which began on 20 January 1963, 1 RNZIR would be committed to the conflict from September 1964, seeing service in Mainland Malaysia and Borneo. 1 RNZIR would initially see action in September 1964 when Indonesian paratroopers landed in Johore, 1 RNZIR was one of the few Commonwealth units in the region and with the New Zealand government's permission hunted down the infiltrators. The following month, 52 Indonesian soldiers landed in Pontian on the Johore-Malacca border and were also captured by New Zealand soldiers. 1 RNZIR would later deploy to Borneo where they would combat Indonesian cross border infiltration. The Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation officially ended in May 1966. ===Vietnam War=== During the Vietnam War, 1 RNZIR which remained at Terendak Camp in Malaysia, would contribute a series of Rifle companies to serve with the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in South Vietnam. ====Creation of the 1st Australian Task Force==== In May 1965 the United States government committed its 173rd Airborne Brigade to South Vietnam in a combat role. Being part of the ANZUS pact Australia and New Zealand were asked to contribute military forces too. Up until this time the Australians had committed an Army training team and New Zealand had committed some non-combatant engineers. In response to the United States' request, the Australian government committed an infantry battalion, its 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR), and a squadron of armoured personnel carriers in June. The 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1ALSG) was established at Vung Tau in support. A headquarters for the force, Commander Australian Army Force Vietnam (COMAAFV), was established in Saigon. New Zealand committed a battery from the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery in July and established its own headquarters (HQ V Force) at Saigon.'Headquarters Vietnam Force (HQ V Force)' | URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/unit-notes#hqvforce | (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Mar-2019)'New Zealand HQ V Force Vietnam' | URL: http://premierstrategics.com/nzvietnam/nzhqvforce.html (New Zealand Vietnam Veterans) The Australian infantry regiment and the New Zealand artillery battery served under operational control of the 173rd Airborne in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Province. initially, 1 RAR defended the Bien Hoa Air Base near Saigon while the paratroopers from the 173rd fought in the highlands. After two months the Australian infantry were deployed on operations in the field. In September the Australian government committed an Artillery battery, an engineer troop from the Royal Australian Engineers, a light aircraft unit equipped with Sioux light helicopters (161st Independent Reconnaissance Flight), 104 Signals Squadron from the Royal Australian Corps of Signals and further logistics support personnel. Disparities in operational methods between the U.S and Australian forces were soon evident and in March 1966 the U.S and Australian governments decided to create an Australian task force with its own Tactical area of responsibility (TAOR). In May 1966 a second Australian battalion arrived, 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR) to help establish the new permanent base at Nui Dat in Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy Province. Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy was to be designated the TAOR for the new task force. In June 1966 the Australian and New Zealand elements were detached from the 173rd Airborne to commence as the 1st Australian Task Force. 1 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR.)Vietnam 1965-1966 URL: https://www.1rar.org.au/vietnam-1965-66/ (1RAR The First Battalion Association)'Australian and New Zealand Forces: The Australian Veteran and the Vietnam Experience Part II' | Author: Bob Teusner | URL: http://grunt-redux.atspace.eu/Order%20of%20Battle/ANZACs/anzac6b1.htm Over the next several months the new task force at Nui Dat was brought up to strength, adding a second artillery battery, an SAS Squadron, engineers from 17th Construction Squadron, intelligence elements, and Light Aid Detachments (LAD) for cavalry and artillery. 1 ATF Headquarters were established with its own Defence and Employment (D&E;) Platoon.'D&E; PLATOON ROLL OF HONOUR' URL: http://www.hq1atf.org/honour3.htm (Headquarters Company, 1st Australian Task Force Web Site) Two American artillery units were also located at Nui Dat: A Battery 2/35 U.S Artillery, and 1/83 Company U.S Artillery.

The South Vietnamese Government's authority over Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy was limited almost entirely to the provincial capital city of B\u00e0 R\u1ecba. The principal communist units in Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy were main forces from the 274th and 275th Regiments of the VC 5th Division headquartered in the M\u00e2y T\u00e0o Mountains at the very north east of the province. Operating in Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and Long Kh\u00e1nh Provinces it comprised both South Vietnamese guerrillas and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) Regular forces. The 274th Regiment was the stronger and better trained of the two, based in north-west Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy in an area known as the Hat Dich secret zone, with three battalions numbering 2,000 men. The 275th Regiment was based in the M\u00e2y T\u00e0o Mountains in an area known as the May Tao Secret Zone, and mainly operated in the east of the province. It consisted of three battalions with a total of 1,850 men. The Viet Cong D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion also operated throughout the province with an estimated strength of 350 men. Its headquarters were located in the Minh Dam Secret Zone in the Long H\u1ea3i Hills near the south coast. Additionally, there were three district-based Viet Cong Local Force units: C23, the Xuy\u00ean M\u1ed9c District Company; C25, the Long \u0110\u1ea5t (Dat Do) District Company; and C41, the Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ee9c District Company. The VC had built up an extensive cadre and political organisation that reached into every town and village. Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy's villages and hamlets in the south were grouped around Routes 15 (the main route between Saigon and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u), Route 2, (running from B\u00e0 R\u1ecba north to Long Kh\u00e1nh Province), Route 44 (running from Long Dien south to the coast), and Route 23 (running from B\u00e0 R\u1ecba north-east to Binh Tuy Province.) The province's roads were dangerous, subject to ambush and passable only with heavy escort. Military estimates placed the number of communist troops in the province at about 5,000. These troops relied on the support of many of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy's villages, each of which had its own VC Guerrilla Squad. Not many villagers were supporters of the South Vietnamese government which they saw as too remote, often corrupt, and not concerned with the concerns of every peasant farmer, such as the reform of land ownership laws. The village of Dat Do, along Route 23, was home to 54% of the provincial population, most of whom were Viet Cong and North Vietnamese supporters, and was concentrated around the best rice fields in the province.https://anzacportal.dva.gov.au/history/conflicts/australia-and- vietnam-war/events/phuoc-tuy-province The Minefield What would ultimately prove to be a tactical blunder by 1 ATF Command and account for the majority of Australian and New Zealand casualties throughout the war, was the laying of a minefield over a 10 km area from Dat Do to the coast. During the laying of the minefield in May 1967, 13 Australian sappers were killed by faulty ordnance, accidents, stress, and distractions by enemy actions. By June 1967, close to 23,000 \"jumping jack\" mines had been laid by the Australian engineers within a 100-meter-wide strip of cleared ground between a double row of fences.'Minefield of Misery' URL: Security of the minefield proved to be ineffective and the VC thereafter simply uplifted the mines and re-used them against the Australians and New Zealanders (if they had not blown themselves up in the process.)'A Minefield' URL: https://anzacportal.dva.gov.au/history/conflicts/australia-and-vietnam- war/events/phuoc-tuy-province/nui-dat/minefield (Australia and the Vietnam War)'The Minefield: An Australian Tragedy in America's Vietnam War' Author: Greg Lockhart, URL: https://apjjf.org/-Greg-Lockhart/2447/article.html (The Asia-Pacific Journal | 4 June 2007 | Volume 5 | Issue 6 | Article ID 2447) ====Victor Company==== The first New Zealand infantry contribution to Vietnam was a 182-man rifle company which arrived from Terendak Military Camp in Malaya on 13 May 1967.

V Company's first shakedown mission, Operation Wellington, was a three-day Search and destroy mission around Nui Dat resulting in 1 VC killed and 1 wounded and 5 suspects captured for questioning.'Kiwi contact with Viet Cong DPR/TV/624' URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su0A9pmnBfw (Australian War Memorial Collection) On 27 May V Company relieved A Company 6 RAR at \"The Horseshoe\", a permanent Fire support base north of the village of Dat Do, some 8 km from the task force base. V Company came under direct command of 1 ATF headquarters, remaining at The Horseshoe until 3 July, and throughout this time effectively built the position from a rudimentary defended position to a fully dug-in and bunkered, fortified base. While the New Zealanders were at The Horseshoe, 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) arrived from Australia to replace 6 RAR. On 3 July, V Company was relieved by A Company, 2 RAR and returned to Nui Dat, thereafter coming under operational control of 2 RAR.'The Horseshoe' URL: https://vcoy67.org.nz/horseshoe2.htm (Victor Company, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, Vietnam 1967) Despite being under 2 RAR operationally, V Company did maintain some command autonomy for all non-operational administrative matters which were reported to the New Zealand HQ V Force Headquarters in Saigon.'Deployment to Vietnam' URL: https://vcoy67.org.nz/deploy.htm (Victor Company, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, Vietnam 1967) V Company's first operation with 2 RAR was Operation Paddington (8-16 July 1967) which was a combined Search-and-destroy operation with 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (7 RAR), Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and U.S forces. This operation also established a fire support base at Xuy\u00ean M\u1ed9c. 1 ATF also provided security for engineer land clearing operations over 136 square kilometers adjacent to and north east of Xuy\u00ean M\u1ed9c. This operation proved very successful with 171 bunkers, 200 meters of trench, three fighting positions, 32 tunnels and 34 other military structures destroyed. A further 138 bunkers, 14 tunnel entrances, 180 meters of trench, and 34 other military structures were damaged and later destroyed by airstrike. 31 VC were killed with no New Zealand casualties. V Company's next operation with 2 RAR was in Operation Cairns (25 July - 1 August 1967.) This was a Search-and-destroy operation south east of Dat Do and east of the freshly completed barrier minefield. It was known that the VC used the wooded areas east of Dat Do as a base and obtained supplies from nearby villages. Although newly laid, the VC were already uplifting the mines from the minefield and re-laying them or booby trapping them elsewhere. 2 RAR's casualties in this operation were all from mine detonations, none from gunfire. There were no New Zealand casualties. V Company then spent the next ten days conducting ambushes and search and destroy patrols in the area of the Long Phuoc hills. The company returned to Nui Dat having discovered and destroyed five VC camps and captured quantities of weapons, with 10 VC dead and two wounded taken prisoner, with no New Zealand casualties.'Fragging is Murder' Author: Brian Wilson, URL: http://truewarstories.com/stories/fragging- is-murder/ (True War Stories) V Company's next operation with 2 RAR was Operation Atherton which began on 16 August. Four teams of Combat engineers from 1 Field Squadron were tasked with conducting land clearing actions. The operation was designed to clear the Communist infiltration routes into the east, maintain pressure on the VC base area, and to secure the eastern flank of the task force base. During a patrol on 2 September 1967 an accidental mine detonation resulted in one New Zealander killed and one other wounded.'Jumping Jack' URL: https://vcoy67.org.nz/jumping.htm (Victor Company Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment Vietnam 1967) Operation Atherton concluded the following day, on 3 September. On 4 September V Company, 2 RAR, and 7 RAR were committed to Operation Ainslie, an operation to clear an area of Route 2 and relocate the inhabitants from three villages under VC influence to a new Australian- built village at Ap Suoi Nghe.https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U53452/ An additional phase was added to the operation as a result of intelligence gained and V Company and 7 RAR were deployed in blocking positions in anticipation of elements from VC 274th Regiment to cross Route 2. Several contacts were made with 18 VC killed with one Australian casualty and one wounded. There were no New Zealand casualties. By 21 September the village had been built and the villagers moved in. A total of 1132 persons, comprising 246 families, were resettled. V Company's final operation with an Australian battalion was in Operation Kenmore (29 September - 11 October 1967) consisting of a Search-and- destroy operation in an area between Xuy\u00ean M\u1ed9c and Cape H\u1ed3 Tr\u00e0m along the southern coast. With C Company at the Horseshoe and D Company providing security at Ap Suoi Nghe, V Company joined A and B Companies of 2 RAR for the operation. 7 RAR was also deployed. The operation overall resulted in 16 VC killed with weapons, ammunition, ordnance and mines captured. Over 12 tonnes of rice and 12 lb of salt were destroyed, and many documents obtained. 230 bunkers, 300 weapon pits and 74 military structures were also destroyed.

W Company's shakedown operation was Operation Lawley during 22 and 23 December 1967, consisting of a cordon and search of the village of Ng\u00e3i Giao, north of the task force base while V2 Company remained at the Horseshoe. On 28 December W Company relieved V2 Company at The Horseshoe and V2 Company joined 2 RAR and 7 RAR in the ongoing Operation Forrest, a search and destroy operation near the Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy-Long Kh\u00e1nh provincial boundaries which had begun on 23 November. The operation concluded 5 January 1968. Operation Duntroon was the next 1 ATF operation involving V2 Company, 2 RAR, and 7 RAR which was a search and destroy operation conducted in conjunction with U.S 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division's Operation Akron V in the Hat Dich area. On the evening of 13 January, while providing left flank protection, a platoon-size group of VC were caught in V2 Company's ambush initiating a firefight that resulted in eight VC killed and 10 weapons captured, with no casualties to V2 Company.Military Cross (MC) Anthony Gordon Howell, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/howell-mc.pdf (NZ Gazette Number 65 dated 17 October 1968 ) The operation concluded 21 January.

Operation Coburg was the first operation conducted by 1 ATF outside of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy and was aimed at denying the VC the ability to attack the large American bases at Long Binh and Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a. 2 RAR and 7 RAR were deployed with 3 RAR remaining at Nui Dat to provide base defence. All three troops of engineers from 1 Field Squadron accompanied each of the battalions to provide mine clearing and additional patrols. A Fire support base was established north-east of Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and east of Long Binh. The two Australian artillery batteries were moved to the FSB. With W Company stationed at The Horseshoe, V2 Company joined 2 RAR for the operation.'Tet Offensive', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/memory/tet- offensive, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 31-Jan-2014 On 26 January B Company, 2 RAR fought a two-hour action against about 25 VC entrenched in a bunker system. On the same day 9 Platoon, C Company, 2 RAR also assaulted and occupied a camp initially believed to be of similar strength and held it for 19 hours after repeated attacks from a VC force estimated to be of company strength. On 28 January, whilst providing flank security, V2 Company engaged in a series of skirmishes which resulted in 12 VC dead and many weapons captured with two New Zealanders wounded. On 1 February V2 Company suffered their first killed in action in a contact with the enemy.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-hd-hirini On the morning of 7 February, V2 Company was attacked by elements of three companies from VC 274th Regiment. Fighting was the fiercest that New Zealand troops had faced up to this time, and over the course of an hour the attack was successfully repelled with the assistance of artillery support from the Australian 108th Battery as well as from mortar fire. The VC withdrew following the arrival of gunships, leaving behind 13 dead and a number of blood trails. Nine New Zealanders were wounded in the engagement, six of whom subsequently required evacuation by helicopter.Mention in Despatches (m.i.d.)

The following day W Company made three contacts with the enemy resulting in two VC killed and one wounded.http://www.wcoy.net/OpCOBURG.html Unfortunately the FSB had been established too close to the village and base activities could easily be seen by the villagers, some of whom were VC spies. On the night of 18 February the Viet Cong launched a massive rocket and mortar attack on the FSB, primarily targeting the U.S and New Zealand artillery positions. Two subsequent waves of VC attacks were held off over two hours with the loss of three members of 3 RAR, one American from 2/35th Field Artillery, and four members of 1st Field Sqn who were caught outside the perimeter while on a standing patrol. 22 Australians and three Americans were wounded. This was the first time 1 ATF had experienced a fire support base being subjected to a ground assault. The base was immediately reinforced by C Company, 3 RAR just in time for a second assault on 19 February, this time with no losses. On 24 February W Company was diverted from relieving 3 RAR at the FSB to report back to Nui Dat in preparation for a new operation with 2 RAR. On 28 February a third assault occurred against the FSB, also beginning with a mortar attack, but the assault was repelled by mortar fire, forcing the attackers to retreat. Three Americans were wounded.

On 27 February 1968 the Australian government sent two troops of Centurion tanks from its 1st Armoured Regiment to South Vietnam, each with four tanks plus two tanks with the squadron headquarters. Two bulldozer tanks and two bridgelayer tanks were also committed. A third troop was created out of the headquarters tanks, and by August the squadron was brought up to its full strength of 26 tanks. Australian and New Zealand infantry would work very closely with these tank troops during their time in Vietnam.1 Armoured Regiment, URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U60600 (Australian War Memorial) Operation Pinnaroo began on 27 February 1968, with V2 Company and W Company joining 2 RAR to strike at the base areas of VC D445 Battalion in the Minh Dam Secret Zone located in the Long H\u1ea3i Hills.

The 4 RAR/NZ companies were moved into blocking positions east of Route 2 on the western edge of Thua Tich, in the north east of the province. The operation also involved 1 RAR sweeping east to west and 3 RAR in a defensive position to the south. It was hoped for 1 RAR's sweeping actions to push the enemy into 2 RAR/NZ's positions. B and C Companies were moved to the area of the Blackstone Trail to carry out a Reconnaissance-in-force. V3 Company and W Company were both deployed north to the area of the Courtenay rubber plantation to intercept a consignment of rockets believed to be moving from east to west. V3 Company took up blocking positions on the western edge of the plantation while W Company swept westward. On 14 September one member from W Company was killed by a sniper during a patrol.http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/bryan-petersen-2.html A further search of the area led W Company to discover a system of tunnels with caches of equipment, food, and medical supplies.

The pink Citro\u00ebn Operation Capital was a two-phase operation conducted again in the area of the Thua Tich where the VC 84 Rear Services Group supplied the local Communist forces and grew crops and stored large caches of supplies and equipment. 3 RAR was deployed to the area on 12 October and 4 RAR/NZ was deployed on 13 October. W Company and 104 Field Battery established their Fire support base on the edge of the Courtenay rubber plantation with W Company providing base security. V3 Company worked with C and D Companies of 4 RAR patrolling east. On 16 October, V3 located a large enemy camp complete with HQ command area, first aid post, printing equipment, kitchens, huts with bunkers underneath, female living quarters, and 19 bunkers with trenches. Due to the size of the camp, V3 Company and the engineers took two days to demolish it.

In two days the New Zealanders and Americans together achieved 20 enemy killed, with 4 killed by W2 Company. Numerous weapons were captured. On 15 May, W2 Company and 3 Platoon from V4 Company were deployed to Dat Do to help 9 RAR reestablish control of the area. The remainder of V4 Company stayed at Nui Dat base conducting local patrols with 4 RAR. 9 RAR and W2 Company cordoned off the village trapping a company- sized enemy force. Both RNZIR companies conducted a sweep of the inner cordon without incident. 1 ATF forces maintained the cordon until 19 May. ====6 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) May 1969 \u2013 May 1970==== On 19 May, 4 RAR was replaced by 6 RAR and the two RNZIR rifle companies with their Assault pioneers and mortar teams merged with A, B and D Companies of 6 RAR to became 6 RAR/NZ (ANZAC), once again with an Australian commander and a New Zealander 2IC.6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U53501 (Australian War Memorial) Retrieved 7 January 2020 The main focus of 6 RAR/NZ was the \"Pacification\" program. After the new battalion's shakedown operation, Operation Hunter (21-26 May 1969), 6 RAR/NZ carried out its first operation in this program from 30 May when it launched Operation Lavarack. This operation involved the establishment of a number of fire support bases to the north of the 1 ATF base, from where company-sized patrols were deployed to specific areas to conduct ambushes and searches. The purpose was to establish enemy movement patterns, particularly those by supply groups, such as the 84 Rear Services Group, which could lead to the location of the main force units. All five rifle companies were deployed, with A Company in the south, B Company in the west, V4 Company in the northwest, D Company in the northeast, and W2 Company in the centre north of a Fire support base. Contacts were made by all companies on the first few days leading to the discovery that the 33rd NVA Regiment had moved into the area, a fact unknown to 1 ATF Intelligence.http://6rarassociation.com/docs/Operation%20Lavarack.pdf On 5 June, one member of W2 Company was killed on approach to an enemy bunker thought to have been destroyed in an immediately prior attack.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/cpl-jr-gatenby Despite supporting mortar and artillery fire, the New Zealanders were trapped for four hours and could not be rescued by APC due to difficult terrain. With the additional assistance of attack helicopters the enemy withdrew and W2 Company moved in to clear the bunker system the following morning. The enemy were revealed to be the VC D440 Battalion, approximately 100 strong.Military Cross (MC) Martin James Knight-Willis, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/knight-willis-mc.pdf (NZ Gazette Number 20 dated 2 April 1970) On 6 June three companies from 1/33rd VC Regiment with elements from VC D440 Battalion, the Binh Ba Guerilla Squad, the Ng\u00e3i Giao Guerrilla Squad, and the Chau Duc District Company attacked the village of Binh Ba. 1 ATF Command deployed the Task Force Ready Reaction Force which consisted of D Company 5 RAR, 1 Troop B Squadron 1st Armoured Regiment, and 3 Troop B Squadron 3 Cavalry Regiment under operational control of 6 RAR/NZ. South Vietnamese Regional Forces were deployed in blocking positions. Intense door-to-door fighting took place in order to clear the village and it became apparent that additional NVA forces were in the area. B Company 5 RAR and additional APCs and tanks were sent as reinforcements and the clearing of the village was passed to 5 RAR as Operation Hammer. The Communist forces were driven out by 8 June but the village of Binh Ba was all but destroyed. Also on 6 June the 1 ATF base at Nui Dat was attacked with rockets and mortars and later in the day 9 RAR came under heavy mortar fire at their Fire support base southeast of Dat Do. The 1 ATF base was again mortared on 7 June. A contact on 11 June by B Company 6 RAR revealed the enemy they had engaged to be 74 NVA Artillery (Rocket) Regiment, those whom were responsible for the rocket attacks on Nui Dat and the FSB. On 12 June, a sentry from V4 Company observed 200 NVA soldiers carrying approximately 50 wounded on litters emerge from the bush into an open area. This was reported to Battalion headquarters. It was thought these were the same forces that A and B Companies had had multiple contacts with earlier in the week. V4 Company was ordered to observe while gunships were called in. However, the element of surprise was lost when the Battalion's support helicopter arrived first, alerting the enemy and causing them to scatter. V4 Company opened up on the group with all weapons brought to bear but were too far to cause any effect. Subsequent helicopter gunships and artillery fire caught some of the fleeing troops but most managed to escape. (Some weeks later Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) Intelligence discovered that the Commanding officer of that same group that V4 Company spotted had been \"severely disciplined\" for what had happened.) On 17 June, V4 Company located a large enemy camp with bunkers and caches and was fired on by heavy small arms and RPGs resulting in one New Zealander being killed.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-js-williams All companies continued to make contacts and on 20 June, after three days laying in wait in an ambush position, D Company sighted a group of 60 NVA retreating with wounded. The ambush was sprung and a third of the group was killed. The group was later identified as 1st Battalion, 274th VC Regiment whom were on their way to a hospital facility in the M\u00e2y T\u00e0o Mountains. On 22 June, 6 RAR's Anti- tank platoon, which had been operating as a Tracker team and as a fourth rifle company under D Company, joined up with V4 Company north of the village of Xa Binh Gia.Shell dressing : Private R J Barry, 6 Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment, URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1233608 (Australian War Memorial) On the same day one section of W2 Company encountered enemy bunkers and were fired upon by small arms and RPGs by an estimated company-strength force.

David Maihi Douglas, URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/honours- awards/douglas-mid.pdf (NZ Gazette Number 20 dated 2 April 1970) Operation Lavarack ended on 1 July. The operation proved to be very successful for 1 ATF and 6 RAR/NZ as a whole was involved in some 85 contacts with VC and NVA forces during this time, resulting in over 102 enemy killed and at least 22 wounded. New Zealand casualties were two killed with seven wounded. Australian casualties were one killed and 23 wounded. The NVA and VC Main Force units were severely weakened as a result and D440 Battalion was disbanded with the remainder transferred into D445 Battalion. With the rest of the battalion remaining at the base, V4 company and B Company together with a team of Tunnel Rats from 1 Field Squadron, next conducted a small operation between 5\u201310 July, Operation Waiouru, with no contacts.http://www.v4coy.com/operation- waiouru.html By this stage of the war, Australian and New Zealand casualties continued to be mostly from mines that the VC had pulled from the Australian barrier minefield and re-laid or had booby trapped. 9 RAR had suffered heavy casualties from mine detonations in a five-week mine clearing operation (Operation Reynella) between 8 May and 15 June. 5 RAR continued mine clearing in the same region (Operation Esso) from 15 June to 15 July, also suffering heavy casualties from mines. Beginning in July 1969 the Australian engineers devised a more effective solution for sweeping the mines from the barrier minefield, by towing steel rollers behind APCs.'Mine buster on trial DPR/TV/1143', URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/F04358/ (Australian War Memorial) The deadliest Operation 6 RAR/NZ next undertook Operation Mundingburra in the Long Hai Hills on 15 July 1969. This operation would prove to be the single most deadly operation for 6 RAR/NZ. 6 RAR's anti-tank platoon and a team of engineers from 1 Field Squadron, accompanied the Australian and New Zealand platoons. The operation had three objectives: disrupt enemy infiltration into the villages, maintain regular checkpoints on the main access routes between the villages, visit local hamlets and offer medical services to those villagers who might need it. A Company deployed by helicopter to the east of Route 44 in an area colloquially known as \"The Light Green\" (for the colour of the vegetation.) B Company deployed by APC east of Xuyen Moc. V4 Company deployed to the area of the Dinh Co Monastery, west of Route 44. D company deployed east of the Long Hai Hills. W2 Company deployed to Route 44 to provide security operations along the route. All platoons conducted mine clearing and ambushing tasks. On 18 July, 6 Platoon from B Company discovered an occupied camp. In the early morning B Company attacked the camp, killing four VC and recovering documents, with five Australians wounded. The enemy were discovered to be C3 Company, D445 Battalion. In the first five days the Battalion made numerous contacts resulted in over a dozen enemy killed and a steady supply of food and ammunition caches recovered. On 21 July two M16 mines were tripped by two members of A company, the second during the medical evacuation of the wounded from the first detonation. The incident resulted in two Australians killed and 24 wounded.'A Day From Hell' URL: http://tunnelrats.com.au/pdfs/militarymedalwinners/PhilBaxterMM.pdf On 23 July, while V4 Company was in the process of clearing the Dinh Co Monastery for use by the locals, a mine discovered by the engineers was detonated killing two Australian sappers and wounding one other. A few hours later one member of W2 Company was killed with five others wounded, two of whom died of their wounds shortly thereafter, from a mine detonation near the hamlet of Ap Lo Gom.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/cpl-jw- radfordhttps://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-tn- hollowshttps://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-av-bermingham On 2 August one member from V4 Company was killed by a booby trap with five others wounded while unloading a truck at the South Vietnamese Regional Force outpost at Lo Gom.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-mj-turnbull The following day 6 RAR lost one of their Assault pioneers and two others were seriously wounded in a mine detonation.

W2 Company was tasked to clear ground in front of the American engineers while A and D Companies provided security to the south and west. During patrolling on 15 September V4 Company discovered an enemy defensive position consisting of 67 bunkers, 130 fighting trenches, 27 trenched shelters, 12 kitchens and a lecture area. Cooking equipment and ammunition were recovered and the position was destroyed. W2 Company had a close call on the evening of 17 September when nearby Royal Thai Army artillery accidentally shelled W2 Company's position with air burst White phosphorus munitions and then later that night again with 155mm M198 howitzer illumination rounds.

On 8 December, D Company located the first major stores dump in a cave at the south of the mountains. It contained approximately 2,500 anti-personnel grenades, 22 anti-tank mines, 22 boxes of anti-watercraft mines and a large quantity of weapons, equipment and explosives. On the same day, B Company, on the north side of the mountain, found the first signs of the hospitals. The following day they discovered a bunker system of 12 bunkers identified as part of K76A Hospital. On 11 December V4 Company, operating in the south-east, located 17 large bunkers large enough to take up to 100 patients and identified it as also part of K76A. By this time all companies were discovering enemy signs and having contacts. On the same day W3 Company, which was patrolling north-east of the Song Rai River, located a large enemy camp with 25-28 VC and at first light the following day attacked the group with one VC killed while the remainder escaped. The group was identified as belonging to Ba Long Rear Services Group and the Ba Long Procurement Section. A Company successfully scaled the western side of the mountain and were able to establish a fire support base on the summit. On 14 December 4/52 ARVN left the operation. On 16 and 17 December D Company located the K76A pharmacy, dental post, and orderly room. There they recovered a huge supply of medical drugs. On 19 December, V4 Company discovered the major part of the hospital, a 200-bed complex complete with underground pharmacy, operating pits and convalescing wards. An enormous cache of medical supplies, food, tools, and equipment were found at the hospital and a large weapons cache was discovered nearby.

A company from the 5th Cavalry Regiment of the ARVN 18th Division joined W Company at The Horseshoe and underwent training, eventually going out on night patrols with the New Zealanders in March. Duties at the Horseshoe involved one platoon patrolling and ambushing, the second platoon as base defense, and the third platoon providing security for the engineers clearing the barrier minefield.https://web.archive.org/web/20110218005917/http://www.ausvets.com.au/vietnam/1970/ops1970.htm Also in February a new 7 RAR arrived to replace 5 RAR in their final tour. Operation Gisborne (28 February - 10 March 1970) was launched as a follow up of events that occurred in February during Operation Hammersley in which 8 RAR had discovered the headquarters of D445 VC Battalion in the Minh Dam Secret Zone while providing security for a land clearing operation in the Long Hai Hills. 8 RAR had suffered heavy casualties in the operation and were unable to pursue the retreating D445 Battalion which were forced out of the Minh Dam Secret Zone to the area of Dat Do.'Operation Hammersley' URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/blog/operation-hammersley-50th (Australian War Museum) Operation Gisborne was therefore launched to search and destroy D445 Battalion. Less W3 Company, 6 RAR/NZ commenced Gisborne on 28 February. On the same day A Company, 6 RAR/NZ discovered the relocated headquarters of D445 Battalion and a company from D440 Battalion. The enemy fled during the night following artillery barrages. The evacuated bunker systems were found the next day by A Company and V4 Company. The enemy withdrew to the south-east. On 3 March 8 RAR was deployed on Operation Hamilton in support of Gisborne. On 8 March D Company, 6 RAR/NZ was involved in a clash with elements of D445 Battalion in \"The Long Green\", resulting in three Australians killed and six wounded. Operation Gisborne ended on 10 March with no New Zealand casualties. 8 RAR continued on with Hamilton until 24 March. On 18 March, V4 Company embarked on Operation Waipounamu, an independent Search and destroy mission into the Nui Dinh Hills to search for the C41 Chau Duc Company. On the second day of the operation two members of 2 Platoon were injured in a command detonated mine and evacuated by helicopter. Shortly thereafter 3 Platoon was ambushed by a well-concealed and strongly defended VC camp, later discovered to have been the size of two companies.

On 2 June, an officer from W3 Company was wounded from shrapnel from an RPG when the platoon discovered and fired on a VC camp. 2 RAR/NZ ended Operation Capricorn on 9 June.MAY 1970 - W3 COMPANY ACTIVITIES URL: https://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/timeline7.htm#29_may Operation Cung Chung followed immediately after beginning on 12 June, which was a Task Force reconnaissance-in-force involving all battalions with the purpose of denying the Communist forces access to villages and to use their supply routes. 2RAR/NZ was positioned along Route 15, 8 RAR was positioned along Route 2, and 7 RAR held positions along Routes 23 and 44. All companies conducted ambushing, security operations around the villages, and reconnaissance actions in search of enemy camps. W3 Company remained at Nui Dat providing base security.June 1970 - W3 COMPANY ACTIVITIES URL: https://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/timeline8.htm (W3 Company RNZIR Vietnam 1969 - 1970) During a reconnaissance of an enemy camp on 18 June, one member of V5 Company was killed from a command detonated 155mm howitzer shell with another dying of wounds shortly after.

While that was occurring W3 Company was temporarily placed under operational control of 8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (8 RAR) who were engaged in Operation Petrie, the mission of which was to destroy VC D440 Battalion. W3 Company's involvement was to support 8 RAR's operations north of Niu Dat, under Operation Quartermile. The operation was downgraded to supplying security to the villages of B\u00ecnh Ba and Ap Suoi Nghe along Route 2. From 13 July 2RAR/NZ commenced Operation Nathan. W3 company went north to the fire base established at Le Loi, alongside Route 2 in which 8 RAR and 161 Bty RNZA were operating. W3 Company commenced search and destroy operations in the Binh Ba rubber plantation. On 21 July while approaching a VC camp, W3 Company was fired on by an RPG, wounding three men. On 26 July, V5 Company, who were operating in the Nui Toc Tien mountains, were pursuing a retreating enemy into caves in the mountains. The VC had mined the area around the caves, several of which were set off, wounding nine members of V5 Company and one member of the New Zealand Special Air Service who was acting as a scout for the platoon.'Ko Tahi Tatau - 3 Platoon V5 Company', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/memory/ko-tahi- tatau-3-platoon-v5-company, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 5-Sep-2013'On patrol - memoir of Ruka Hudson', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/memory/excerpt-life-not-easy-ruka-hudson, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 5-Sep-2013 W3 Company remained at the fire base at Le Loi until 2 August when it was relieved by 8 RAR. Operation Cung Chung II was launched 3 August involving 7 RAR, 8 RAR and 2 RAR/NZ to ambush VC supply routes. W3 Company, less their mortar team, departed the operation on 10 August returning to Nui Dat from 14 to 22 August to provide security for the base. The W3 mortar team returned to Nui Dat on 29 August and at the request of 3rd Cavalry were deployed the next day with them and a troop of the Australian tanks, engineers from 1 Field Squadron, and 1 ATF HQ's Defence & Employment (D&E;) Platoon on Operation Massey Harris, a food denial program conducted in the area of B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e2u along the western border of Phuoc Tuy and Binh Tuy. It was known that this was the area that 84 Rear Services Group (who had relocated from the M\u00e2y T\u00e0o Mountains in 1969) were growing crops. One of the APCs struck a booby trapped mine injuring 12 Australians, eight of them D&E; Platoon members whom were riding in the APC. A Kit Carson Scout was killed in the blast, the only fatality.'OPERATION Massey Harris' URL: http://www.hq1atf.org/mharris.htm (Headquarters First Australian Task Force, South Vietnam, 1966-1972) W3 Company again came under operational control of 8 RAR and was redeployed from Nui Dat onto Operation Cung Chung II and from 31 August provided security for Australian land clearing teams. A number of contacts resulted in important information about the VC units operating in the area and in particular a contact by W3 Company on 20 September resulted in important documents being captured revealing the effectiveness of the recent ambushes and details of supply line changes to D445 VC Battalion and C41 Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ee9c District Company. Operation Cung Chung II concluded 10 September and 2 RAR/NZ, less W3 Company, returned to Nui Dat for a further period of rest and retraining. W3 Company's mortar teams completed Operation Massey Harris and on 18 September rejoined W3 Company for their last two days of operations with 8 RAR. With W3 Company back with the ANZAC Battalion, 2 RAR/NZ and 7 RAR were redeployed on Operation Cung Chung III on 21 September. W3 Company remained in the field until 25 September, and returned to Nui Dat to provide base security.'September 1970 - W3 COMPANY ACTIVITIES' URL: https://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/timeline11.htm On 28 September an ambush laid by V5 Company resulted in eight VC killed and one captured.

Consequently, the U.S artillery units that supported 1 ATF were withdrawn from South Vietnam in November. The Australian and New Zealand governments also took measures to reduce troop strength. After three tours Whisky 3 Company was withdrawn in November and was not replaced. By the end of their tour Whisky 3 suffered three killed and 13 wounded.http://www.w3vietnam.org.nz/document/W3%20Casualties%201970.pdf Thereafter, Victor 5 was the only RNZIR infantry company in theatre for the remainder of 2 RAR/NZ's tour. Also in November, 8 RAR returned to Australia and was not replaced, reducing 1 ATF to only two battalions: 2 RAR/NZ and 7 RAR. Further U.S reductions saw the 2nd Brigade 25th Infantry Division which operated north of the Phuoc Tuy-Long Khanh borders begin its departure in December 1970, withdrawing entirely by May 1971. The U.S 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (less one squadron) also began to withdraw from February 1971.https://web.archive.org/web/20100702184815/http://www.ausvets.com.au/vietnam/1970/ops1970.htm Between December 1970 through to 21 February 1971, 2 RAR/NZ and one troop from 1st Armoured Regiment always under operational control of 2 RAR/NZ conducted night ambushes around Hoa Long, returning each day to Nui Dat.\"Commander's Diaries C Squadron (2nd Tour) 16 December 1970 \u2013 30 September 1971' (Page 2) URL: https://www.paratus.org.au/c2-squadron-2 (1ST ARMOURED REGIMENT ASSOCIATION INC.) To offset the withdrawal of the second New Zealand infantry company, in January the New Zealand government committed the 1st New Zealand Army Training Team (1 NZATTV) to Vietnam. 1 NZATTV was made up of advisors from all branches of service, a number of whom had served in the RNZIR companies and the RNZA battery in Vietnam. The team assisted an American training team in Chi Lang to train South Vietnamese platoon commanders in weapons and tactics.'Unit notes - Vietnam Veterans List - New Zealand Army Training Teams (1 NZATTV, 2 NZATTV and ATTV)' URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/resources/unit-notes#nztraining, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Mar-2019 From 1 February 1971 Operation Phoi Hop began which was to begin handing over 7 RAR's area of operations to the South Vietnamese forces.'Australian and Vietnamese forces combine in Operation Phoi Hop (Co-operation) in Phuoc Tuy' URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C37065 (Australian War Memorial) 7 RAR's involvement ended 21 February in preparation for their return to Australia, with 2 RAR/NZ relieving 7 RAR.

On 26 February 3 RAR was deployed to the Horseshoe to commence in-theatre training. 2 RAR/NZ supplied a rifle company to 3 RAR to assist.

Several contacts occurred and a bunker system was found and destroyed. To further 3 RAR's successes, A Company 2 RAR/NZ was placed under operational control of 3 RAR on 26 March, further reducing 2 RAR/NZ to just one Australian rifle company and Victor 5 Company. 3 RAR were then deployed on Operation Briar Patch I to directly search for and destroy D445 Battalion while the remainder of 2 RAR/NZ continued on Operation Phoi Hop. After 3 RAR was involved in heavy fighting on 31 March V5 Company relieved C Company, 3 RAR. The operations by 2 RAR/NZ and 3 RAR to track down D445 VC Battalion continued throughout April but the VC managed to escape and withdraw into Long Khanh Province. Victor 5 Company returned to Nui Dat at the end of April to make preparations to leave South Vietnam and return to Singapore. Operation Phoi Hop concluded 2 May. Victor 5 ended their tour in South Vietnam having suffered 4 killed and 27 wounded. ====4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) May 1971 \u2013 December 1971==== On 6 May 1971 Victor 5 was replaced by Victor 6 and after familiarization training with 3rd Cavalry commenced their first operation on 15 May in the area of the Courtenay rubber plantation, while the outgoing 2 RAR conducted short reconnaissance and ambush operations in around Nui Dat until end of their operations on 20 May. On 22 May 2 RAR was replaced by 4 RAR. The final and sole New Zealand infantry company was integrated with B, C, and D companies of 4 RAR to become 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) for the second time, serving until the withdrawal of the Australian and New Zealand combat troops. Unlike previous battalions whom conducted rotational duties as base defence or at The Horseshoe in addition to field operations, 4 RAR/NZ would spend the entirety of their tour on operations in the field with rotations at Nui Dat as the Task Force Ready Reaction Force, and for rest and retraining.4 Battalion The Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR/NZ) ANZAC URL: http://vvaavic.org.au/4-battalion-the-royal-australian-regiment-4rar (Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia Victoria)/ From 3\u20135 June, the new ANZAC Battalion conducted their shakedown operation, Operation Bhowani Junction, in the area of the Courtenay rubber plantation. By 1971 Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy had been largely cleared of local VC forces, who were now increasingly reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. As a measure of some success, Route 15 was opened to unescorted traffic. However, the reduction of American and Australian forces did not go unnoticed by the Communists. Intelligence reports had indicated a growing presence of well-trained North Vietnamese Army troops in northern Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy and the final battles fought by Australians and New Zealanders in Vietnam were against these North Vietnamese Regular forces, following the launch of Operation Overlord on 5 June. 2/8 Battalion from the U.S 1st Air Cavalry Division's 3rd Brigade was brought into the operation and with 4 RAR/NZ and 3rd Cavalry placed in a static role of cordoning through ambushing, while 3 RAR with tanks from C Squadron 1st Armoured Regiment were deployed on search-and-destroy actions. 3 RAR became involved in intense fighting against elements of the NVA 33rd Regiment including VC 274th Regiment in the Battle of Long Kh\u00e1nh, sustaining heavy casualties during these engagements, but the battalion successfully hindered their attempts to move south into the province. Operation Overlord concluded on 14 June to be immediately followed up with Operation Hermit Park, with 3 RAR this time in the static role and 4 RAR/NZ tasked with locating and destroying elements of VC 274th Regiment and C41 Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ee9c Company. This operation would be a significant engagement for Victor 6 Company. B and C Company were deployed to the south west of the province to search for C41 Company while V6 Company was deployed to the north west border where the 274th Regiment was thought to be reestablishing itself. On 24 June 1971, while approaching the outskirts of a bunker one member of V6 Company was shot by a sentry, dying of wounds later that night after medevac efforts were hampered.http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/kenneth- harding-2.htmlhttps://vietnamwar.govt.nz/veteran/pte-kh-harding The following day V6 Company moved up to assault the bunker position.

Braving heavy fire the combined firepower of the tanks and V6 Company forced the enemy to withdraw by the evening. The position was discovered to have been held by 1st Battalion, VC 274th Regiment, an estimated 40-60 men.Transcript of interview with Lieutenant Colonel J C Hughes CO 4 RAR/NZ ANZAC URL: https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/awm- media/collection/S01418/document/1865936.PDF (Australian War Memorial) Operation Hermit Park concluded 27 July. From the middle of July, 4 RAR/NZ progressively occupied a large hill overlooking the Courtenay rubber plantation, nicknamed \"Courtenay Hill\" which was strategic also for the fact that it was located midway between the communist bases in the Hat Dich and in the M\u00e2y T\u00e0o Mountains. The hill was solid rock and had to be built up with over 100,000 sandbags to provide adequate observation and defense functions. Courtenay Hill became the headquarters and Command Post of 4 RAR/NZ through to October 1971.'Aerial view of Courtenay Hill (left) at the commencement of Operation Overlord. Surrounded by ...' URL: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1159951 (Australian War Memorial) On 28 July 3 RAR and 4 RAR, less V6 Company who remained at Nui Dat as the Ready Reaction Force, were immediately deployed on Operation Iron Fox to conduct operations along the Suoi Ca river near the Long Khanh and Phuoc Tuy borders with the purpose of further restricting VC 274th Regiment's efforts to re enter the province.http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/bernard- pengilly-2.html On 5 August 4 RAR/NZ were deployed on Operation Northward, conducting ambushing and patrolling from Courtenay Hill. Australian and New Zealand withdrawal In August 1971 the Australian government had announced that 1 ATF would be withdrawn from South Vietnam before Christmas. The New Zealand government also announced New Zealand's withdrawal.

V6 Company patrolled west of Route 2 while D Company patrolled east of Route 2, and B Company patrolled south, near Binh Ba. 3 RAR was also deployed west of the Song Rai River nearer to the Long Khanh border. On 20 September 33rd NVA Regiment launched a rocket attack on an Australian APC column travelling north on Route 2 that was on its way to the South Vietnamese Regional Force outpost at Cam My village which had been rocketed the previous day. The attacks on the RF base and on the responding Australian APCs were intentionally launched by the NVA to bait the Ready Reaction Force company at Nui Dat to respond whereupon a massive ambush had been laid for the Reaction Force. B Company travelled out from Nui Dat by APC as expected, but by sheer happenstance the Company Commander stopped the Company short of the ambush site and without knowing it went around the Kill zones. On 21 September D Company discovered the bunker system of the same enemy forces that had attacked the RF base and had laid the trap for the Ready Reaction Force, and engaged in fierce fighting against 600 NVA Regulars, but now with no tanks and limited artillery support. The bunker system turned out to be the location of both the 33rd Regiment headquarters and its 2nd Battalion. As the day turned to night fighting continued with 3rd Battalion, 33 Regiment also involved. American airstrikes and Australian artillery held the enemy at bay, saving D Company from being wiped out. After 14 hours of fighting the enemy disengaged. The Battle of Nui Le resulted in five Australians from D Company killed and 30 wounded. Late in the afternoon of the following day D Company were reinforced by V6 Company in anticipation of a follow-up attack, but none came. On 23 September, V6 Company lead the final assault against the bunker, however when they arrived, the enemy had withdrawn. As a result of the battle, the 33rd Regiment withdrew permanently from Phouc Tuy Province.'The Battle of Nui Le' URL: http://www.4rarassociationsaustralia.com/nui-le-rev.html (4 RAR ASSOCIATIONS OF AUSTRALIA) Retrieved 8 January 2020https://web.archive.org/web/20110218012808/http://www.ausvets.com.au/vietnam/1971/ops1971.htm Retrieved 30 November 2019 Operation Ivanhoe concluded on 2 October. With 3 RAR back at Nui Dat preparing to return to Australia, V6 Company's last combat operation was Operation Valiant which together with B Company 4 RAR, involved a sweeping action each side of Route 2 during the move back to Nui Dat from Courtenay Hill. D Company was already back at Nui Dat as the Ready Reaction Force and C Company was airlifted back on 4 October. The move took from 3\u20136 October and resulted in one contact for V6 Company, which would be the last contact for the battalion and for 1 ATF.Story 58 - Reminiscing 1971 The Final Days, Author: Ken Mackenzie, URL: http://www.au104.org/Veteran_Stories/vetstory58.html (104 Signal Squadron South Vietnam) With the battalion's tour cut short, Victor 6's last operation was one of protecting the activities of 1 ATF's withdrawal from South Vietnam during Operation Southward (6\u201316 October 1971). As the only Australian battalion left, 4 RAR/NZ was reinforced by some U.S elements including artillery while they moved the South Vietnamese forces fully into the Nui Dat base. The majority of 4 RAR/NZ withdrew from Nui Dat to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u on 7 November 1971. The Australians departed on 8 December and the New Zealanders departed on 9 December. D Company, 4 RAR, remained behind until 12 March 1972 in order to provide security to rear details. The last Victor Company would suffer a total of 1 killed and 5 wounded during its tour in South Vietnam. The very last RNZIR contribution to the Vietnam War was in March 1972, when the second New Zealand Army Training Team (2 NZATTV) arrived at the U.S Dong Ba Thin Base Camp, near Cam Ranh Bay on the south-east coast. Made up of members from various New Zealand branches of service including RNZIR, the team helped train Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) personnel in weapons and tactics and first aid.

In 1971 the 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group would be disestablished and 1 RNZIR would come under the command of ANZUK Force. In June 1971 1 RNZIR would relocate from Nee Soon to Dieppe Barracks. In 1974 ANZUK Force was disbanded and 1 RNZIR became the Infantry component of the New Zealand Force South East Asia which it would remain a part of until 1989 when 1 RNZIR was redeployed to Linton Camp in New Zealand.'New Zealand military base in Singapore', URL: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/new-zealand-military-base-singapore, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 13-Sep-2017 === 1973 Reorganisation === In 1973, the Regimental Depot in Burnham Camp was predesignated as the 2/1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Battalion, creating for the first time since 1948 a second Regular Infantry Battalion in the New Zealand Army. Today, the RNZIR has two Regular Battalions: *1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment *2/1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment An additional battalion, known as the 3/1st Battalion RNZIR, was occasionally formed as a composite battalion from the Territorial Battalions during exercises. === Somalia === In the first deployment of New Zealand combat troops to a war zone since the Vietnam War, 1 RNZIR contributed a rifle section to provide security for the New Zealand Supply Contingent in Somalia from July 1993. There would be two rotations with the final section departing Somalia in June 1994. === Former Yugoslavia === Alongside troops from Queens Alexandra's Mounted Rifles (QAMR), 1 RNZIR and 2/ RNZIR would both contribute to the Mechanized Infantry Company Group that formed New Zealand's commitment to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Serving as part of a British Battalion from 1994, two Company Group rotations would serve in the Former Yugoslavia. === 2013 Reorganisation === On 17 March 2013 the six TF battalions were amalgamated into three Battalions; *2nd/4th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (2/4 RNZIR), from **2nd Battalion (Canterbury and Nelson-Marlborough and West Coast), RNZIR, and **4th Battalion (Otago and Southland) RNZIR *3rd/6th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (3/6 RNZIR), from **3rd Battalion (Auckland [Countess of Ranfurly's Own] and Northland), RNZIR and **6th Battalion (Hauraki) RNZIR *5th/7th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (5/7 RNZIR), from **5th Battalion (Wellington West Coast and Taranaki) RNZIR and, **7th Battalion (Wellington [City of Wellington's Own], Hawkes Bay) RNZIR. ==Organisation== A New Zealand soldier fires a Canadian C7A2 service rifle during the US-NZ-CA joint Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise, July 2014 A member of 1 RNZIR in East Timor during 2007 In the New Zealand Army, an infantry platoon is commanded by a second lieutenant or a lieutenant with a Platoon Sergeant (holding the rank of sergeant), a Platoon Signaller and a medic (where relevant) comprising the Platoon Headquarters. The platoon is sub-divided into three sections of between 7\u201310 soldiers, each commanded by a corporal with a lance corporal as the Section second-in-command (Section 2iC). Each section can be sub-divided into two fire-teams, commanded by the Section Commander and 2iC respectively, as well as normal two-man Scout, Rifle and Gun Teams. In recent years the section organisation consists of the two fire team concept, where the section is divided into two fire teams with a Gun Team in each and one commanded by the section corporal and the other section lance corporal with a section marksmen in each team and the leftover riflemen divided equally among the two fire teams. The section corporal is still in overall command and is in contact with the other fire team via radio if the situation changes. There are three platoons in a rifle company, which is commanded by a major, and three rifle companies within an infantry battalion, which is commanded by a lieutenant colonel. An infantry battalion will also contain an organic Support Company including a signals platoon, mortar platoon (mortars now officially under the artillery corps but still used by infantry on deployment), Direct Fire Support Weapons Platoon which includes anti-armor, heavy machine guns and automatic grenade launchers, Reconnaissance Platoon and Sniper cell, and a Logistics Company (transport and stores). The battalion totals around 400 to 500 soldiers depending on retention levels. ==Battle honours== Because it is recruited on a nationwide basis and has no specific regional links, the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment claims descent from the old New Zealand Regiment and all previous Territorial Infantry Regiments of the New Zealand Army. As a consequence, it is permitted to display a selection of 105 battle honours awarded to ten separate regiments: *New Zealand *South Africa 1900\u201302 *The Great War: **Anzac, Gallipoli 1915 **Somme 1916 '18, ** Messines 1917 ** Ypres 1917 ** Polygon Wood ** Passchendaele ** Arras 1918 ** Hindenburg Line ** France and Flanders 1916\u201318 *World War II: **Greece 1941 **Crete **Minqar Qaim **El Alamein **Takrouna **North Africa 1940\u201343 **Cassino I **The Senio **Italy 1943\u201344 **South Pacific 1942\u201344 *South Vietnam 1967\u201371only battle honour awarded to a New Zealand unit since 1945 ==Alliances== * \u2013 The Royal Highland Fusiliers * \u2013 The Rifles * \u2013 Royal Australian Regiment * \u2013 Brigade of Gurkhas * \u2013 7th Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment * \u2013 1st Commando Battalion ==Notes== Footnotes Citations ==References== * * * * * * * * * * *Document: Honour Roll of all New Zealanders wounded in action (WIA), killed in action (KIA) or died of wounds (DOW) in Vietnam url=https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/nz-honour-roll- vietnam.pdf ==Further reading== * * Category:Regiments of New Zealand Category:Military units and formations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in New Zealand ",
