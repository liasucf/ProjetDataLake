    "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Somalia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. LGBT is highly illegal in Somalia; same-sex sexual activity is punishable by up to death in areas controlled by Al-Shabab as well as in Jubaland. LGBT persons are regularly prosecuted by the government and additionally face stigmatization among the broader population. == Legality of same-sex sexual activity == === Italian East Africa === In 1940, Italy conquered British Somaliland and annexed it into the Italian East Africa. While Italy didn't have sodomy laws since 1890, the Fascist regime still punished homosexuals. In 1941, the British reconquered British Somaliland and re-instated their sodomy laws. === British Somali Coast Protectorate=== Prior to independence from the British, the Indian Penal Code of 1860 was applied in British Somali Coast protectorate.LEGISLATIVE DECREE NO. 5 OF 16 December 1962 === Somali Republic === In 1964, a new penal code came into force in the Somali Republic. The code states that \"Whoever has carnal intercourse with a person of the same sex shall be punished, where the act does not constitute a more serious crime, with imprisonment from three months to three years. Where the act committed is an act of lust different from carnal intercourse, the punishment imposed shall be reduced by one-third.\" The code has since been abolished by the United Kingdom after seeing it as one of the most discriminating laws crafted by a former world power. The United Kingdom has since then legalised homosexuality, civil partnership, and same-sex marriage with the radical leftward shift of British politics witnessed in the last 20 years. === Somali Democratic Republic === Under Article 409 of the Somali Penal Code introduced in 1973, sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex is punishable by imprisonment from three months to three years. An \"act of lust\" other than sexual intercourse is punishable by a prison term of two months to two years. Under Article 410 of the Somali Penal Code, an additional security measure may accompany sentences for homosexual acts, usually coming in the form of police surveillance to prevent \"re-offending\". Extrajudicial executions are tolerated. === Federal Government of Somalia === ==== HIV/AIDS prevention ==== Family planning services are hard to access, as is fact-based information on human sexuality. Humanitarian workers have stated that Islamic social mores often make it difficult to publicly talk about how the virus can be spread. Since 1999, much of the AIDS/HIV education and care has come from international organizations such as the United Nations. Despite this, Somalia has one of the lowest HIV infection rates on the continent. This is attributed to the Muslim nature of Somali society and adherence of Somalis to Islamic morals. While the estimated HIV prevalence rate in Somalia in 1987 (the first case report year) was 1% of adults, a more recent estimate from 2007 now places it at only 0.5% of the nation's adult population. ==== LGBT organizations ==== As of 2004, one group reportedly existed for LGBT people in Somalia. === Civil war === In territories controlled by Harakat al-Shabaab al- Mujahideen in Somalia, the terrorist organization enacts a strict interpretation of shariah which explicitly outlaws homosexuality. The punishment for those found guilty is at a judge's discretion and may be punished by death.Report: Somalia too risky for LGBT people == HIV prevalence by region == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 0%; border: none; align:left\" |+The HIV prevalence in 2004 - sentinel sites of the three regional zones ! scope=\"col\" | Region/Zone and Sentinel Site ! scope=\"col\" | Number Tested ! scope=\"col\" | Number Positive ! scope=\"col\" | Percentage Positive |- | Somaliland |- | Hargeisa || 499 || 8 || 1.6 |- | Berbera || 350 || 8 || 2.29 |- | Borama || 362 || 4 || 1.10 |- | Burco || 350 || 2 || 0.57 |- | Mean - Somaliland || 1561 || 362 || 1.41 |- | Puntland |- | Bosaso || 324 || 3 || 0.93 |- |Garowe|| 284 || 2 || 1.70 |- |Mean - Puntland||897||9||1.00 |- |Galmudug | | | |- | Galkayo || 289 || 4 || 1.38 |- | South Central |- | Mogadishu || 1232 || 11 || 0.89 |- | Merca || 350 || 0 || 0.0 |- | Jowhar || 351 || 1 || 0.28 |- | Hudur || 351 || 1 || 0.29 |- | Mean - South Central || 2165 || 13 || 0.60 |- | Mean - Overall || 4732 || 44 || 0.93 |} == Living conditions == The U.S. Department of State's 2010 Human Rights Report found that \"sexual orientation was considered a taboo topic, and there was no public discussion of this issue in any region of the country,\" and that \"there were no reports of societal violence or discrimination based on sexual orientation.\" == Summary table == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | No (Penalty: Up to three years prison in government- controlled areas) No (Penalty: Up to execution in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab and in Jubaland) |- | Equal age of consent | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) | No |- | Same-sex marriage | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Step-child adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Gays and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military | No |- | Right to change legal gender | No |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} == See also == * LGBT rights in Africa * LGBT rights in Somaliland * Human rights in Somalia * Death penalty for homosexuality == References == == External links == *\"Soulmates: The Price of Being Gay in Somalia\" Afrol News *Ali, Noor. \"Gay Somali refugees face death threats.\" (Archive) Al Jazeera. 7 July 2013.
