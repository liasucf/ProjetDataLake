    "text": "Behind the Times E.P. is the second extended play by AFI released on 11 June 1993 on Key Lime Pie Records. The EP was reissued in October 2016 via Atom Age Industries, a company owned by former AFI bassist Geoff Kresge. The reissue featured slightly altered artwork on a glossier sleeve, but was otherwise identical. Tracks 1 and 2 were re-recorded and released on the vinyl pressing of Very Proud of Ya and later on the AFI retrospective. Tracks 3-5 were rerecorded for AFI's debut full-length album, Answer That and Stay Fashionable. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from liner notes. * Adam Carson \u2013 drums * Davey Havok \u2013 vocals * Keith Gaudette \u2013 engineer * Geoff Kresge \u2013 bass, layout * Kim Hansen \u2013 back cover photo * Markus Stopholese \u2013 guitar ;Studios * Recorded at City of Light, Lakeport, CA == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Variants ! scope=\"col\"| Edition ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\"| United States | June 11, 1993 | rowspan=\"3\"| 7\" vinyl | black | 400 copies | rowspan=\"2\"| Key Lime Pie | rowspan=\"2\"| keyEP2 |- | December 16, 1994 | black | 100 copies |- | October 15, 2016 | | | | |} ==References== Category:1993 EPs Category:AFI (band) EPs ",
