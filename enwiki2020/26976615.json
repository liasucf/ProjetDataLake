    "text": "The 2010\u201311 Liga I was the ninety-third season of the top-level football league of Romania. The season commenced on 23 July 2010 and ended on 21 May 2011. A winter break where no matches were played was held between 11 December 2010 and 18 February 2011. A total of eighteen teams participated in the league, where CFR Cluj were the defending champions. ==Teams== Politehnica Ia\u0219i, Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b and Unirea Alba Iulia were relegated to Liga II after finishing the 2009\u201310 season in the bottom three places. Ceahl\u0103ul Piatra Neam\u021b and Unirea Alba Iulia made their immediate return to the second level, while Politehnica Ia\u0219i ended a six-year tenure in the highest football league of Romania. 15th-placed team Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu, who originally were to be relegated as well, were allowed to remain in Liga I after Interna\u021bional Curtea de Arge\u0219 withdrew from the league because of financial reasons. Interna\u021bional thus returned to Liga II after having been promoted the previous season. The four relegated teams were replaced by the champions and runners-up from both 2009\u201310 Liga II divisions. Victoria Br\u0103ne\u0219ti and Sportul Studen\u021besc were promoted from Seria I while T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 and Universitatea Cluj were promoted from Seria II, with Victoria Br\u0103ne\u0219ti and Universitatea Cluj being constrained to play their home games on grounds in other cities (than home based) as their did not meet Liga I requirements. ===Venues=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin:0.5em auto;\" |- !
