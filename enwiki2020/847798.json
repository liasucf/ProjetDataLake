    "text": "Mark Buckingham is a British comic book artist. He is better known for his work on Marvelman and Fables. ==Career== Born as Mark John Buckingham, on 23 May 1966, in Clevedon, United Kingdom. He initially started working professionally on strips and illustrations for a British satire magazine called The Truth in 1987 where he first worked with Neil Gaiman illustrating some of his articles. His American debut came the following year as inker on DC Comics Hellblazer, taking over as penciller from issue 18. Some of Buckingham's earliest (non-professional) work appeared in early issues of the Clevedon Youth CND newsletter in the early 1980s (c.1982/83) in which he satirised members of the group in a fun and amusing manner. Copies of these are now very hard to find, although there a few still known to be in existence. He is most famous for his work on Marvelman (Miracleman, in the USA), Hellblazer, and Fables, including a story in the original graphic novel 1001 Nights of Snowfall. His Marvel work includes inking Chris Bachalo's pencils on Generation X, Ghost Rider 2099, and penciling Paul Jenkins's run on Peter Parker: Spider-Man. For DC Comics, Buckingham has inked the two Death miniseries and was the original penciller on the Titans series. In the 1990s Mark shared a studio with The Beano and Marvel artist Kev F. Sutherland, working together on Marvel's Star Trek and Doctor Strange. During the Vertigo Voices: Fables Forum panel at the 2009 San Diego Comic Con, Fables creator and writer Bill Willingham announced that he and Buckingham would switch roles in an up-coming one-off, for Fables issue #100: Buckingham would write and Willingham would illustrate. In July 2012, as part of the San Diego Comic-Con, Buckingham was one of six artists who, along with DC co-publishers Jim Lee and Dan DiDio, participated in the production of \"Heroic Proportions\", an episode of the Syfy reality television competition series Face Off, in which special effects were tasked to create a new superhero, with Buckingham and the other DC artists on hand to help them develop their ideas.
