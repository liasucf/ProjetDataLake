Wayne State finished the 2019 season with a winning record of 8\u20133. ==Schedule== The Warriors regular season schedule for 2020 consists of 10 regular season games. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the university announced on June 5, 2020, that the regular season would only consist 10 games, instead of the originally scheduled 11. On August 12, the GLAIC announced the suspension of all sports competition until at least January 1, 2021, effectively cancelling the 2020 season. ==References== Wayne State Category:Wayne State Warriors football seasons Wayne State ",
