    "text": "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea Football Association or DPR Korea Football Association (PRKFA) (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: ; Hanja: ) is the governing body of football in North Korea. The association was founded in 1945 and it joined FIFA in June 1958 and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in September 1974. ==Organization== PRKFA is \"notoriously hard to contact\". The association used to have a single fax number, and nowadays hosts a single email address. FIFA executive J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne remembers: \"You sent a fax. Sometimes you got a reply\", while football journalist James Piotr Montague's emails for \"the best part of a decade\" were always left unanswered. Even FIFA does not know for certain what the league system overseen by the PRKFA is like and what teams play in it. ===League structure=== #DPR Korea League #DPR Korea League 2 #Amateur DPR Korea League 3 ==Presidents== As of 2010, FIFA's website and the AFC's website list Mun Jae-chol () as the association's president; he is also mentioned as such in a report published in November 2008. Earlier presidents apparently include Choe Nam-gyun (), listed on the FIFA website from July 2007 until at least July 2008, and in an overview of leading positions in the state (as of ?2009) on the website DPRK Search, with \u201cSeptember 2006\u201d in brackets behind his name, and Rim Kyong-man (), listed as president on FIFA's website until June 2007. The Secretary General is Kim Jang-san. {|class=\"wikitable hlist\" style=\"text-align:left\" !Name !Position !Source |- | Ri Ryong-nam |President | |- | An Song-il |Vice President | |- | Han Un-gyong |2nd Vice President | |- | Kim Jang-san |General Secretary | |- |n/a |Treasurer | |- | Jang Pong-yong |Technical Director | |- | Kim Yong-jun |Team Coach (Men's) | |- | Jo Song-ok |Team Coach (Women's) | |- | Kim Yong-chol |Media/Communications Manager | |- |n/a |Futsal Coordinator | |- | Song Hye- yong |Referee Coordinator | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * North Korea at the FIFA website. * North Korea at the AFC website.
