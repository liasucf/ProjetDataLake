    "text": "Muhammad Rashid Rida (; 23 September 1865 or 18 October 1865 \u2013 22 August 1935) was an early Islamic reformer. Rida is said to have been one of the most influential and controversial scholars of his generationEncyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thompson Gale (2004), p.597 and was deeply influenced by the early Salafi Movement and the movement for Islamic Modernism founded in Egypt by Muhammad Abduh.Encyclopedia of Islam, Juan Campo, p. 581http://world- news-research.com/21sept2012.html Rida was born near Tripoli in Al-Qalamoun in Beirut Vilayet. His early education consisted of training in \"traditional Islamic subjects\". In 1884\u20135 he was first exposed to al-`Urwa al-wuthqa, the journal of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh. In 1897 he left Syria for Cairo to collaborate with Abduh. The following year Rida launched al- Manar, a weekly and then monthly journal comprising Quranic commentary.Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thompson Gale (2004), p.597 ==Ideas and Controversies== Rashid Rida, was a leading exponent of Salafism Daniel Ungureanu, Wahhabism, Salafism and the Expansion of Islamic Fundamentalist Ideology, p146. and was especially critical of what he termed \"blind following\" of traditional Islam. He encouraged both laymen and scholars to interpret the primary sources of Islam themselves.Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 8. No. 731, 732 Applying this principle enabled Rida to tackle a number of subjects in a modern way and sometimes led to him holding unorthodox ideas that were considered controversial by some and progressive by others. One of his controversial views was his support of Darwin's theory of evolution.Rashid Rida, \"Nazariyat Darwin wa al-Islam\", al-Manar, vol 30. no. 8, March 1930, 593 - 600 To justify Darwinism, Rida considered it permissible to \"interpret certain stories of the Qur'an in an allegorical manner, as, for example, the story of Adam\".Charles C. Adams, Islam and Modernism in Egypt, p.187. Also, Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 8. no. 581, 582. He also believed that the origin of the human race from Adam is a history derived from the Hebrews and that Muslims are not obliged to believe in this account.Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 7, no. 483. Other controversial beliefs held by Rida included: \\- His view that usury (riba) may be permitted in certain cases (i.e. in cases of extreme poverty, wherein it would save their life) Rida stated that \"usury may be permitted in cases of necessity (darurah)\" John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, (1848, first edition), London, 1909, p. 926 \\- His idea that building statues is permissible in Islam as long as there is no danger of their being devoted to improper religious uses such as shirk (idolatry)Charles C. Adams, Islam and Modernism in Egypt, p.194. Also, Rashid Rida, al-Manar, vol 4, no 56 \\- His support of the British against the Ottomans Hasan Kayali, Arabs and Young Turks, Ottomanism, Arabism and Islamism in the Ottoman Empire 1908-1918, Berkeley, CA, 1997, p. 185 \\- His view that \"the minute living bodies which today have been made known by the microscope and are called microbes, may possibly be a species of Jinn\" Rashid Rida, Al-Manar, vol 4. No 334, 335 \\- His insistance that istislah is \"a central rather than subsidiary principle for defining the law...[which] makes adaptions more flexible\" and assertion that the \"no harm no retribution\" hadith is superior to all other principles of Shariah Rida focused on the relative weakness of Muslim societies vis-\u00e0-vis Western colonialism, blaming Sufi excesses, the blind imitation of the past (taqlid), the stagnation of the ulama, and the resulting failure to achieve progress in science and technology. He held that these flaws could be alleviated by a return to what he saw as the true principles of Islam albeit interpreted (ijtihad) to suit modern realities.Glasse, Cyril, The New Encyclopedia of Islam, Altamira Press, 2001, p.384 This alone could, he believed, save Muslims from subordination to the colonial powers.Emmanuel Sivan, Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, enl. Ed. (New Have: Yale University Press, 1990), p.101 Rida had a close relationship with Freemasonry,Karim Wissa, \u201cFreemasonry in Egypt 1798-1921\u2033. The British Society for Middle Eastern Studies Bulletin, vol.16, no.2, 1989 though his feelings toward the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith were quite negative.Juan Cole, Muhammad `Abduh and Rashid Rida - A Dialogue on the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. World Order (journal), vol. 15, nos. 3-4 (Spring/Summer 1981): pp. 7-16. Despite some controversial ideas held by Rida, his works and in particular his magazine al-Manar spread throughout the Muslim world influencing many individuals including the popular Salafi writer Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani.Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, Introduction, p.9. Prophet's Prayer (Sallallaahu 'Alaihi Wasallam) Described from the Beginning to the End as Though You See it, introduction, p4. \"He began to specialize in the field of Hadith and its related sciences by the age of 20 -- being influenced by articles in Al-Manar magazine.\" Muhammad Rashid Rida was one of the earliest critics of Zionism and wrote an article on the Movement as early as 1898.Be\u0161ka, Emanuel: RESPONSES OF PROMINENT ARABS TOWARDS ZIONIST ASPIRATIONS AND COLONIZATION PRIOR TO 1908. In Asian and African Studies, 16, 1, 2007. Rida died on his way back to Cairo from Suez, where he had gone to see off his patron, King of Saudi Arabia Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.Soage, \"Rashid Rida's Legacy\", p. 2. ==Contributions to Islamist political thought== The corruption and tyranny of Muslim rulers (caliphs, sultans, etc.) throughout history was a central theme in Rida's criticisms. Rida, however, celebrated the rule of Muhammad and the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and leveled his attacks at subsequent rulers who could not maintain Muhammad's example. He also criticized the clergy (ulama) for compromising their integrity - and the integrity of the Islamic law (sharia) they were meant to uphold - by associating with worldly corrupt powers.Rida, Muhammad Rashid. 1934. Al-Khilafa aw al-Imama al-Uzma [The caliphate or the great imamate]. Cairo: Matba'at al-Manar bi-Misr, p. 57-65. Rida's ideas were foundational to the development of the modern \"Islamic state\". He \"was an important link between classical theories of the caliphate, such as al- Mawardi's, and 20th-century notions of the Islamic state\".Eickelman, D. F., & Piscatori, J. (1996). Muslim politics. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 31. Rida promoted a restoration or rejuvenation of the Caliphate for Islamic unity, and \"democratic consultation on the part of the government, which he called 'shura'\". In theology, his reformist ideas, like those of Abduh, were \"based on the argument that: > shari'a consists of `ibadat (worship) and mu'amalat (social relations). > Human reason has little scope in the former and Muslims should adhere to the > dictates of the Qur'an and hadith. The laws governing mu'amalat should > conform to Islamic ethics but on specific points may be continually > reassessed according to changing conditions of different generations and > societies. Although he did not call for the revolutionary establishment of an Islamic state, rather advocating only gradual reform of the existing Ottoman government, Rida preceded Abul Ala Maududi, Sayyid Qutb, and later Islamists in declaring adherence to Sharia law as essential for Islam and Muslims, saying > Koran 5:44 applies to '...whomsoever thinks it distasteful to rule in > accordance with the just rules which God sent down, and does not rule by > them because he has different views, or because he has worldly interests. > According to these verses, they are unbelievers; because true faith requires > obedience. Obedience requires deeds, and is not consistent with > omission'Rida, Muhammad Rashid, Tafsir al Manar, VI, p.330 ==See also== *List of Islamic scholars ==References== ==External links== *Short biography *Rashid Rida Hometown Website *Les cl\u00e9s du Moyen-Orient *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article Category:Mujaddid Category:Quranic exegesis scholars Category:Arab Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Syrian Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Syrian Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:20th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Editors of religious publications Category:Muslim reformers Category:1865 births Category:1935 deaths ",
