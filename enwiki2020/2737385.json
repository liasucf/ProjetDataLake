    "text": "Outlying Islands is a 2002 drama play written by Scottish playwright David Greig. While all the events and characters in the play are works of fiction, it was inspired by Robert Atkinson's book Island Going. ==Synopsis== Set on a remote Scottish island in the summer of 1939, two ornithologistsyoung, impulsive and English Robert and the more-conservative-yet naive Scottish Johnare sent to catalogue the bird colonies on the island. Together with the stern lease-holder of the island, Mr Kirk, and his young niece Ellen, they are the only inhabitants for the summer. The play ruthlessly uncovers the motivations of its characters, resulting in a painful triangle between John, Robert and Ellen. It is about nature versus technology, old versus new, with the threat of the coming world war looming over it all. ==Production History== The play was first published and performed in 2002 and won a Fringe First award and a Herald Angel award after its premiere at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It was revived at the Traverse in October 2014. The play was performed by Sugarglass Theatre at the Connelly Theatre in New York in 2016 and later revived at the Samuel Beckett Theatre in Dublin in August 2017. The play was revived in January 2019 by Atticist at the King's Head Theatre in London. == Casting History == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Character !Original Cast, 2002 !New York Cast, 2016 !Dublin Cast, 2017 !London Revival Cast, 2019 |- |Robert |Laurence Mitchell |Jefferson White |Leonard Buckley |Tom Machell |- |John |Sam Heughan |Peter Corboy |Peter Corboy |Jack McMillan |- |Kirk |Robert Carr |Leon Ingulsrud |Karl O\u2019Neill |Ken Drury |- |Ellen |Lesley Hart |Maeve O'Mahony |Maeve O'Mahony |Rose Wardlaw |- |Captain |Robert Carr |Leon Ingulsrud |Karl O\u2019Neill |Ken Drury |} ==See also== * 2002 in literature * Scottish literature == References == == External links == * The book on Faber and Faber's website * A review of the 2004 American premiere in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette * Category:Fiction set in 1939 Category:2002 plays Category:English-language plays Category:Ornithology in the United Kingdom Category:Plays set in Scotland Category:Scottish plays ",
