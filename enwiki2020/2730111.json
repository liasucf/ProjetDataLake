    "text": "Shadow Builder is a 1998 film directed by Jamie Dixon. It is based on the story \"The Shadow Builder\" by Bram Stoker. ==Plot== An evil Archbishop and his followers summon a demon to destroy the world, but the demon's first act is to kill its summoners. It does so in an appropriately unique manner, by turning the bodies of its victims into what appears to be solid shadow, which disintegrates at the first touch of light, any light. Light is in fact the demon's anathema. Unable to stand the slightest glimmer at its creation, the creature gains strength and solidity with each kill, allowing it a greater resistance to the light; and with it the ability to affect and control those around it, including a pack of vicious dogs. As the town is orchestrated towards its own destruction, it proceeds to hunt down a particular child. A pivotal sacrifice, necessary to complete its transition into the light, and unleash its Evil. ==Cast== *Michael Rooker - Jacob Vassey *Leslie Hope - Jennifer *Andrew Jackson - Shadowbuilder *Shawn Thompson - Sheriff Sam Logan *Kevin Zegers - Chris Hatcher ==Reception== TV Guide noted in its positive review that \"While the basic premise and a few details of Shadow Builder are familiar, the movie has been put together with commendable skill.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1998 films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:Canadian supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:1998 horror films Category:Films based on works by Bram Stoker Category:Canadian films ",
