    "text": "Reicholzheim is a town in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany. It is located in the Tauber valley at the foothills of the Odenwald and the quiet forests of the Spessart on the banks of the Tauber river near the mouth of the Tauber into the Main river. Reicholzheim had 1,450 inhabitants in 2003. == Description and location == It is located in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg near the most northern point of that state. Located in the beautiful Tauber Valley in a historical area between the picturesque old town of Wertheim and the monastery of Bronnbach. Reicholzheim is part of the Franconian region of Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg and became a part of Baden only through political manoeuvres in 1806. The landscape of Tauber Franconia has been split since that time between Bavaria and Baden. == History == ===Early history=== \"All indications suggest Reicholzheim was a community by the 8th and 9th Century\", according to Reicholzheim - \u00c4ltestes Dorf im unteren Taubertal by Dr. Paul Benz, 1984 (written in German). It may be that Reicholzheim is even older because excavations show evidence that dates back to the 5th century AD. Reicholzheim is first mentioned in a document of 1178 as Richolfsheim. Bishop Reinhard von W\u00fcrzburg confirms that the Cistercian abbey Bronnbach lies in the area of the Parish of Reicholzheim. Reicholzheim received the place name either from the knight Richolt or from Richulf, the Archbishop of Mainz (in office 787-813). ===Reicholzheim in the Middle Ages=== In the Middle Ages Reicholzheim had different names: Reicholtsheim, Reichelsheim, Richolfsheim and Richolvesheim. The village then belonged to the land of the count of Wertheim. In 1369 Reicholzheim became part of the lands of the monastery in Bronnbach. There were three other villages beside Reicholzheim that also belonged to Bronnbach. Reicholzheim was * 1573\u20131622 Catholic * 1622\u20131628 Lutheran * 1628\u20131631 Catholic * 1631\u20131634 Lutheran * 1635\u20131647 Catholic * 1648\u20131674 Lutheran * 1674\u20131803 Catholic The first entry in the baptisimal book of recatholized Reicholzheim is from April 25, 1674. Today the majority of people in Reicholzheim remain Catholic. In the 12th century the village was subordinated to the county village of the Wertheimer count. After the establishment of the monastery at Bronnbach in the year 1151 Reicholzheim is mentioned as a monastery village. Thus everything in Reicholzeim belongs to the monastery Bronnbach in the year 1285 of count Rudolf. By the sales of the road court in the 1369 also the last right of the Wertheimer count turned everything into the monastery Bronnbach, so that Reicholzheim was now fully subordinate to the monastery of Bronnbach. During the reformation in 1524, Reicholzheim ignored the Reicholzheimer, for 150 years again in came into the possession of the count in Wertheim and thus began an alternation of denomination from Catholic to Evangelist 7 times. Thus the sovereignty over Reicholzheim in the Middle Ages changed again and again between the count von Wertheim and the monastery Bronnbach that to the diocese of Wuerzburg. The lay administration offices of the monastery were accommodated, so e.g. in Reicholzheim the tax collection place of the Wuerzburg diocese. Starting from the 16th century the viticulture of Reicholzheim was of great importance. This was above all the Bronnbachern monks doing, which affected the culture of the village in religious and mental regard. Thus the monastery promoted the viticulture and the agriculture in Reicholzheim and operated in addition in Bronnbach a brewery, brennerei and a mill. ===Reicholzheim in the 19th and 20th centuries=== Reicholzheim belonged until 1803 to the (Zisterzienser) monastery of Bronnbach. This was the feudal system and all inhabitants had to work for the feudal lords. The monks as other village people had to work for their aristocratic masters. Bronnbach which is and was just to the south of Reicholzheim had under its rule at least three other villages. Bronnbach is still existence today, and has a huge ancient castle-like monastery, now home of a big historical archive of Baden. Bronnbach itself belonged at a certain time to the Bistum of Wuerzburg, which was a big and important \"state?\" in Germany at that time. Also there was a big rivalry between Bistum of Wuerzburg and the Bistum of Mainz. Mainz was very active in the area and had some influence in Bronnbach. Beside these church states and areas the very small place of Wertheim which was to the north, reigned by a Count, This political administration played a role, but never regained control over Bronnbach and Reicholzheim after the loss of the villages in Thirty Year War. In 1803 the Old German Reich ceased to exist, the church states were extinguished, and Wertheim and Reicholzheim after three years of interregnum both came to the grand duke of Baden. Up to 1927 the village had had only ten wells, which then were replaced by a modern water supply system. From the 1950s to 1970s, the agricultural character of the village changed into a more and more industrially structured area. In 1951 the wine-growers-cooperative was founded. The vineyards of Reicholzheim are about 25 hectares. The wine-growing village Reicholzheim (7 km). There you can visit the wine market and the wine gallery.

Eight of the stone crosses are engraved with different indications / symbols: Swords, Dolchmesser, hammer, Lillie and a jug or a port up. Beside the stone crosses a bildstock (prayer column) is from the year 1722. thumb Around the stone cross collection the following legend has come about.: a beautiful girl is to have been killed near the roadway, the boy that killed her survived, he went to Gamburg, where he killed himself. His family had the cross made to prevent a bloody revenge from the family of the girl. Historically the stone crosses were from different places in Reicholzheim, they were gathered and were then set up and the wall built. In a village order of 1494 the stone crosses are first mentioned, so that it may be assumed, that at this time already a first accumulation of crosses were to be found there. Generally the stone crosses are from between the 14th and 16th centuries. ===Saint George Catholic Church=== The Catholic Church in Reicholzheim The old Church of St. George was probably established 1673 or 1674.
