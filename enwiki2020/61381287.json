    "text": "A hand-held kamif\u016bsen , refers to several types of paper balloons in Japanese culture. They are simple toys for children, advertising give-aways for traditional medicine companies, and illuminated flying balloons at festivals. Smaller kamif\u016bsen are popular as traditional children's toys in Japan. These kamif\u016bsen have an open hole, and reinflate as they are bounced in play. The balloon is made of glassine paper known as washi, which is air-resistant, glossy and thin. The paper \"has a degree of plasticity that allows it to deform easily and retain its resulting shape\". The properties of these paper balloon toys are of interest to scientists. Newlyweds playing with a kamif\u016bsen Traditionally, kamif\u016bsen were sold in dagishiya, small shops selling candy, snacks and inexpensive toys to schoolchildren as an alternative to the more expensive rubber balloon. They are now sold in souvenir shops and online. Another variation, known as the is in the shape of a cube rather than a sphere, and is associated with the marketing campaigns of traditional medicine companies. Much larger kamif\u016bsen, resembling sky lanterns, are flown each year at the in Semboku, Akita. ==Physics== Toy kamif\u016bsen display some counterintuitive properties that have been studied by scientists. Even though they have an open hole, they tend to inflate rather than deflating when bounced up by a person's hands. According to Ichiro Fukumori of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \"Despite the open hole visible in the silver patch, the kamif\u016bsen stays inflated when bounced on the palm of one\u2019s hand. Moreover, repeated bouncing causes a deflated kamif\u016bsen to swell by itself to its fully inflated condition. The elastic rebound of the balloon paper is not enough to explain the full inflation; a batted kamif\u016bsen actually sucks in air from the atmosphere.\" ==Variations== Chicken kamifusen Some kamif\u016bsen intended for decoration are made in the shapes of animals, birds and fruits. A kakuf\u016bsen (\u89d2\u98a8\u8239) (kaku means \"angled\") is a paper balloon in the shape of a cube rather than a sphere, often used for commercial marketing purposes. Door-to-door salesmen called baiyaku-san (\u58f2\u85ac\u3055\u3093) from the traditional medicine companies of Toyama used to give out kak\u016bf\u016bsen printed with drug company advertising. Small chests filled with various medicines and bandages were left at no initial cost with customers, and the salesman would return from time to time, to restock the cabinet and collect payment. This system of \"use first, pay later\" marketing of medicines is called \"okigusuri\". Hot-air kamif\u016bsen in Kamihinokinai in 2015 Kamifusen being launched at a festival in alt= The Kamihinokinai Paper Balloon Festival (\u4e0a\u6867\u6728\u5185\u306e\u7d19\u98a8\u8239\u4e0a\u3052) is held in Semboku, Akita on February 10 each year. Hundreds of very large hot-air kamif\u016bsen, resembling sky lanterns, are flown for good luck in the coming year. The festival has mythical origins, and was suspended during World War II. It was revived in 1974. According to tradition, Hiraka Gennai (1728-1780), a scientist in the Edo era, introduced paper balloons as markers for the copper mines in the mountains of the region, and also as entertainment. ==In Japanese culture== Two major Japanese films have featured kamif\u016bsen in their titles. Humanity and Paper Balloons (\u4eba\u60c5\u7d19\u98a8\u8239 Ninj\u014d Kami F\u016bsen) is an acclaimed 1937 drama film, and Torasan and a Paper Balloon \u3064\u3089\u3044\u3088 \u5bc5\u6b21\u90ce\u7d19\u98a8\u8239 Otoko wa Tsurai yo: Torajir\u014d Kamif\u016bsen) is a 1981 comedy. ==See also== *Fu-Go balloon bomb *Paper lantern *Sky lantern ==References== ==Further reading== ==External links== * Base Camp Math: How to Inflate a Paper Kamifusen Balloon:Tadashi Tokieda, Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University, illustrates and explains how a toy paper ball can be inflated without being blown up.
