    "text": "Alexey, Alexei, Alexie, or Aleksey ( ; ) is a Russian and Bulgarian male first name deriving from the Greek Al\u00e9xios (), meaning \"Defender\", and thus of the same origin as the Latin Alexius. Alexey may also be romanized as Aleksei, Aleksey, Alexej, Aleksej, etc. It has been commonly westernized as Alexis. Similar Ukrainian and Belarusian name is romanized as Oleksii (\u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0456\u0439) and Aliaksiej (\u0410\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439), respectively. The Russian Orthodox Church uses the Old Church Slavonic version, Alexiy (\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441i\u0439, or \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0439 in modern spelling), for its Saints and hierarchs (most notably, this is the form used for Patriarchs Alexius I and Alexius II). The common hypocoristic is Alyosha () or simply Lyosha (). These may be further transformed into Alyoshka, Alyoshenka, Lyoshka, Lyoha, Lyoshenka (), sometimes rendered as Alesha/Aleshenka in English. The form Alyosha may be used as a full first name in Bulgaria (\u0410\u043b\u044c\u043e\u0448\u0430) and Armenia. In theory, Alexia is the female form. It is however virtually nonexistent in Russian-speaking countries. A popular Ukrainian and Belarusian female name Olesia/Olesya/Alesia/Alesya is one possible form. The patronymics based on Alexey are Alexeyevich and Alexeev (male) and Alexeyevna and Alexeeva (female). The following surnames derive from Alexey and its various forms: * Alexeyev/Alekseyev * Alexeyevsky * Alyoshin * Alyokhin (Alekhine, Alekhin) * Lyoshin * Alexeytsev/Alekseytsev /Alekseitsev * Alexeychuk/Alekseychuk/Alekseichuk * Alexeychik/Alekseychik/Alekseichik * Alexeyuk/Alekseyuk * Alexeyenko/Alekseyenko/Alekseenko * Alexeychenko/Alekseychenko/Alekseichenko * Alexievich Alexeyevka is a common Russian village name. ==Persons known by first name Alexey== *Aleksei (Russian convert to Judaism) * Alexei, a fictional character in the science fiction horror web television series Stranger Things *Alexis of Russia, Tsar of Russia from 1645 to 1676, son of Tsar Michael *Aleshenka, a rumored alien found in Russia *Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, son of Tsar Alexander II *Alexey Andreevich Anselm, Russian theoretical physicist *Alexei Beletski, Ukrainian-born Israeli ice dancer *Oleksii Bychenko (born 1988), Ukrainian- born Israeli figure skater, Olympian *Alexei Cherepanov (1989-2008), Russian hockey player *Alexei A.
