    "text": "Fratton is a residential and formerly industrial area of Portsmouth, in Hampshire, England. It consists of mostly Victorian terraced houses, and is typical of the residential areas in the city. There is also a modest shopping centre on Fratton Road, called The Bridge Centre, which is dominated by a large Asda supermarket and various vacant units, and in atmosphere reflects the working-class roots of the neighbourhood, with local, low-budget shops and cafes. Fratton railway station is one of the four railway stations on Portsea Island. Due to its location as the last stop before the main Portsmouth & Southsea railway station, Fratton has been adopted in naval slang as a euphemism for the withdrawal method of contraception, \"getting off at Fratton\".http://qi.com/infocloud/the-navy == History == The name Fratton was once Froddington, a Saxon name which originally meant \"Frodda's Farm\" or \"Frodda's village\". A pub on Fratton Road is still named \"The Froddington Arms\".http://www.localhistories.org/fratton.html Goldsmith's Farm and Fratton Common were part of the original small rural village originally called Froddington, the only visible evidence of this being the presence of a public house, \"The Froddington Arms\" on the western side of Fratton Road. Froddington was one of the three small settlements on Portsea Island mentioned in the Domesday Book. Due to developments during the Industrial age, more of the surrounding land was absorbed by Portsmouth in the 1870s and 1880s, principally by new housing developments. ==Governance== Fratton is a Portsmouth City Council ward within the Portsmouth South parliamentary constituency. It was formed for the 2002 Portsmouth City Council election as the successor of the pre-2002 Fratton ward. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor |- | 2002 |style=\"background-color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Philip Shaddock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2003 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Philip Shaddock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2004 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Philip Shaddock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2006 |style=\"background-color: \"| |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Philip Shaddock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2007 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Philip Shaddock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2008 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2010 |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | David Fuller (Con) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2011 | style=\"background-color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | David Fuller (Con) | style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2012 |style=\"background- color: \"| | Mike Hancock (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2014 |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Julie Swan (UKIP) |style=\"background-color: \"| | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Eleanor Scott (Lib Dem) |- | 2015 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Julie Swan (UKIP) |style=\"background- color: \"| | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Dave Ashmore (Lib Dem) |- | 2016 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Julie Swan (UKIP) |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | Dave Ashmore (Lib Dem) |- | 2018 |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" |Tom Coles (Labour) |style=\"background-color: \"| | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background- color: \"| | Dave Ashmore (Lib Dem) |- | 2019 |style=\"background-color: \"| | Tom Coles (Labour) |style=\"background-color: \"| | David Fuller (Lib Dem) |style=\"background-color: \"| | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\" | Dave Ashmore (Lib Dem) |} indicates seat up for election. ==Trivia== * Despite its well known name, Portsmouth F.C.'s Fratton Park stadium is not built in the Fratton district of Portsmouth, it was actually built between 1898-1899 on farmland around the (then) village of Milton on the eastern side of Portsea Island. The Fratton Park stadium today still resides within the neighbouring Milton district of Portsmouth. This can be proven from the current Portsmouth FC postal code, \"PO4 8RA\" which has a \"PO4\" prefix Milton district postal code, not a Fratton (and Portsmouth city centre) \"PO1\" prefixed code. The streets and houses immediately around Fratton Park are officially designated as being within the \"Milton Ward\" district for local and national governmental elections. The boundary line between Fratton and Milton is marked along the Portsmouth Direct Line railway line. Fratton Park is located south of the railway line and is therefore within the Milton district. * Fratton Park's name was deliberately (and misleadingly) chosen in 1899 to persuade users of Fratton railway and tram station that Portsmouth FC's football ground was nearer to convenient transport links than it actually was. Fratton railway station is approximately one mile away from Fratton Park, about a ten minute walk down Goldsmith Avenue. ==References== Category:Areas of Portsmouth ",
