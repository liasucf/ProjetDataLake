The Restaurant & Bar Design Awards is an independent award system, set up by Marco Rebora in 2008 in the United Kingdom with the encouragement of a panel of judges, including the editor-in-chief of Wallpaper*, Tony Chambers. Since the first awards in 2009 there have been over 10,000 entries from design and architectural industries and hospitality organisations from 100 countries around the world. Each year the awards are judged by a new panel of representatives from the fields of art, architecture, design and gastronomy. Notable judges have included Ian Callum, Mark Hix, Gerry Judah, Yotam Ottolenghi, Thomas Heatherwick, Julia Peyton-Jones and Karim Rashid. The winners are awarded at annual ceremonies at a chosen host venue affiliated with the award. In 2012 the ceremony was held at The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Restaurant & Bar Design Awards organises a year-round programme of events based in the UK and most recently Internationally with an aim to build a network between entrants, judges, partners and sponsors. In 2014 Taschen publications published a book, Restaurant & Bar Design dedicated to the ongoing work of the Awards. == Categories== Each year the Restaurant & Bar Design Awards acknowledges two overall winners under the categories of Best Bar and Best Restaurant.
