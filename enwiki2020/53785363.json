(2019), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and became the best-performing album of 2019 in the US. It also reached number one in the UK. The album contains six Billboard Hot 100 top 40 songs: \"When the Party's Over\", \"Bury a Friend\", \"Wish You Were Gay\", \"Xanny\" and \"Bad Guy\", the last of which became her first number one single in the US. In 2020, she performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\" for the James Bond film of the same name, which became her first to peak at number one in the UK. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, and one Brit Award.

She is the daughter of teacher, actress, and screenwriter Maggie Baird, and construction worker Patrick O'Connell, who worked part-time as an actor, appearing in films like Iron Man (2008). Both her parents are amateur musicians. She is of Irish and Scottish descent. The singer's middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate (proposed by her brother Finneas, four years her senior) was to be her middle name. She was conceived via in vitro fertilization. She was raised in Los Angeles' Highland Park neighborhood. While she was homeschooled, her mother taught her and Finneas the basics of songwriting. O'Connell and her brother had worked together on some music, while he had been writing and producing his own songs and performing with his band. O'Connell said her brother and her mother inspired her to get into music. Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing and acting. O'Connell wrote her first \"real\" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from which she took script lines and episode titles that she added to the song as part of the assignment. O'Connell had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series. She performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight. ==Career== ===2015\u20132017: Don't Smile at Me=== Eilish performing in August 2017 In October 2015, Eilish recorded the song \"Ocean Eyes\", written and produced by Finneas originally for his band, after her dance teacher asked them to record a song for a dance routine.

The record and Eilish received praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC One, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas. Finneas' manager had reached out to him after he made \"Ocean Eyes\" to discuss Eilish's potential. In a deal arranged by Finneas, Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R; company Platoon, which helps package artists before they get a major label deal. Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image. A music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" was released in March 2016. By August 2016, Eilish had signed to The Darkroom, a record label, artist management company and imprint of Interscope Records.

Eilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, \"Today's Top Hits\". The Baffler described Eilish's sound as fitting into the \"streambait\" genre consisting of largely \"mid-tempo, melancholy pop\" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose \"singing style, bleakness, and the hip-hop influenced production\" shaped the aesthetic.

Doreen St. F\u00e9lix of The New Yorker opined that she has a \"husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy\". Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also \"reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become\", describing her soprano as \"too diminutive for vocal calisthenics\", adding that her \"playful version of teen-goth angst\" and \"electro-saturated debut album\" captivated a diverse audience. Her music incorporates pop, dark pop, electropop, emo pop, experimental pop, goth-pop, indie pop and teen pop. Eilish's brother, Finneas, collaborates on songwriting and making music. Her brother writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music and also performs in live shows. Eilish and Finneas \"like to completely make up things and become characters\" and \"have songs that are really fictional\". Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences. They try to write \"really interesting and conversational\" lyrics: \"We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about.\" Finneas has stated when he writes songs for his sister, he aims to \"write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own\". When he writes with Eilish, he tries \"to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas\", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story. Eilish has wanted to direct her own music videos since she was 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience. In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song \"Xanny\". ===Influences=== Eilish grew up listening to The Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day and Lana Del Rey. She has said that stumbling upon \"Runaway\" by Aurora on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career. Hip hop music is Eilish's favorite genre and biggest inspiration. She has cited Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences for her and other influences include Earl Sweatshirt, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Nicki Minaj, and Lana Del Rey. She has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey, the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, stating, \"That woman [Del Rey] has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that.\" She has also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices, after she called fashion her \"defense mechanism\" during an acceptance speech. Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album Thank U, Next inspired her to continue making music. == Awards and nominations == Eilish is the recipient of numerous awards including five Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, one NRJ Music Award, one Brit Award, and three Billboard Music Awards.

But in truth, she\u2019s nothing of the sort.\" ===Fashion style=== Much of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, ill-fitting clothing. In 2017, Eilish stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her. She tries to be \"really different from a lot of people\" and dresses opposite to what others wear. Aiming to \"look memorable\", Eilish said that she \"proved to people that [she's] more important than they think\" and likes being \"kind of intimidating, so people will listen up.\" In 2019, she stated: \"Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing.\" In May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advert, wherein she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from body-shaming her. In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, Eilish premiered a short film entitled Not My Responsibility which addresses her experiences of body- shaming.

In August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song \"You Should See Me in a Crown\" in Music Lab sessions in its stores. Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from Love Live!, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line. The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism. == Activism == Eilish is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and among others has criticised the dairy, wool, and mink fur industries.
