    "text": "Vidarbha is the north-eastern region of the Indian state of Maharashtra, comprising Nagpur Division and Amravati Division. Amravati division's former name is Berar (Varhad in Marathi).Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\u2014page-323 It occupies 31.6% of the total area and holds 21.3% of the total population of Maharashtra. It borders the state of Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south and Marathwada and Khandesh regions of Maharashtra to the west. Situated in central India. The largest city in Vidarbha is Nagpur followed by Amravati. A majority of Vidarbhians speak Varhadi and Zadi dialects of Marathi.Vidarbha is the birth place of Goddess Rukmini.http://www.buzzalive.com/lifestyle/travel/dialects- in-maharashtra/ The Nagpur region is known for growing oranges and cotton. Vidarbha holds two-thirds of Maharashtra's mineral resources and three- quarters of its forest resources, and is a net producer of power. Vidarbha region contains Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project, Melghat Tiger Reserve, Bor Wildlife Sanctuary, Navegaon National Park And Famous Tibetan Camp in Arjuni Morgaon, Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary and Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary. Pench Tiger Reserve is one of the premier tiger reserves of India and the only one to straddle across two states: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Throughout its history, Vidarbha has remained much calmer than the rest of India, especially during the communal troubles. However, there is considerable poverty and malnutrition. It is less economically prosperous compared to the rest of Maharashtra. The living conditions of farmers in this region are poor compared to India as a whole. There have been more than 200,000 farmers' suicides in Maharashtra in a decade, of which 70% being in the 11 districts of Vidarbha region. There have been recent calls for a separate state of Vidarbha, due to perceived neglect from the Government of Maharashtra and incompetent political leadership in Vidarbha. Though rich in minerals, coal, forests and mountains, this region has mostly remained underdeveloped because of the continuous dominance of political leadership from the other parts of the state, especially Western Maharashtra. Being culturally, politically and financially distinct from the rest of Maharashtra, the calls for a separate state rose to prominence only when the leaders from this region were sidelined by other political leaders in recent years. Statehood demands have not been fulfilled mainly due to the opposition from the Shiv Sena, a major state political party. == History == ===Ancient period=== Coin of the Vidarbhas of the Deccan. Uncertain ruler. (1st century BCE) Obv Linear cross with each arm terminating in pellet-in-annulet. Rev Tree in railing. Vidarbha was part of the Satavahana Empire (1st century BCE - 2nd century CE), as suggested by Satavahana coin finds in Pauni.\"Pauni : (Vidarbha) The latest site which contributed valuable numismatic evidence confirming, once and for all, ancient Vidarbha's early Satavahana affiliation is Pauni, in district Bhandara.\" in Vidarbha was ruled by the Vakataka dynasty in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. It consists of two branches \u2013 The Pravarapura Nandivardhana and Vatsagulma (now called as Washim) branches. The Pravarapura Nandivardhana branch ruled from different capitals like Pravarapura (Paunar) in Wardha district and Mansar and Nandivardhan (Nagardhan) in Nagpur district. This branch used to maintain matrimonial alliances with the Guptas. The Vatsagulma branch was founded by Sarvasena, the second son of Pravarasena I after his death. Sarvasena made Vatsagulma (present-day Washim) his capital. The territory ruled by this branch was between the Sahydri Range and the Godavari River. They patronised some of the Buddhist caves at Ajanta. Prabhavatigupta was the queen and regent of the V\u0101k\u0101\u1e6daka Empire. Her father was Chandragupta II of the Gupta Empire and her mother was Kuberanaga of the Naga. She married Rudrasena II of the V\u0101k\u0101\u1e6daka. After his death in 385, she ruled as regent for her two young sons, Divakarasena and Damodarasena for twenty years. This region is named after the mythological Vidarbha Kingdom mentioned in the Mahabharata. ===Medieval period=== Coin of King Jagadeva of the Paramaras of Vidarbha, 12th\u201313th centuries CE. Nagpur was the capital of the Berar Subah, known as the Gulshan- e-Berar in the Medieval period, from the rule of the Khaljis to the Mughals, according to the Ain-i-Akbari and Alamgir Namah. In 1724, when Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah declared independence, the existence of Berar as a Mughal Subah came to an end. It became (though nominally) a part of Nizam state.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 7, p. 369 Then the Bhonsle dynasty of Marathas who in the mid-eighteenth century created an independent Hindu princely state that covered much of east-central India. After their defeat in the Third Anglo- Maratha War in 1818, the Bhonsle dominions were reduced to the Nagpur division. In 1853 the last Maharaja of Nagpur died without a male heir and subsequently Nagpur division was incorporated into mainstream British India. Nagpur division became a part of the British Raj's Central Provinces in 1861. ===Modern period=== Map of Central Provinces and Berar regions of British India. Nagpur is shown as capital of Central Provinces. Amravati division, formerly known as Berar division, was administered by the Nizam of Hyderabad until 1853. In that year, citing misgovernance by the Nizam, the British colonial administration took direct control over the province. Berar was added to the Central Provinces in 1903. During India's independence struggle Nagpur hosted the sessions of Indian National Congress several times. Sevagram in Wardha was arguably the capital of nationalistic India during the Gandhian era. Main entrance of the Nagardhan Fort in Ramtek, commissioned by Raghuji Bhonsle of the Bhonsale dynasty of the Maratha Empire in the 18th century After India's independence in 1947, Central Provinces and Berar became the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. In 1956 Vidarbha was transferred to Bombay state along with all other Marathi-speaking areas. In 1960 Bombay State was split along linguistic lines into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Marathi-speaking Vidarbha became part of the state of Maharashtra. == Geography == Chikhaldara is the only hill station in Vidharbha Wainganga river near Bhandara district Vidarbha lies on the northern part of the Deccan Plateau.

Large basaltic rock formations exists throughout Vidarbha, part of the 66-million- year-old volcanic Deccan Traps. Bhandara and Gondia district are entirely occupied by metamorphic rock and alluvium, making their geology unique in Maharashtra. Buldhana has the Lonar crater created by impact of an asteroid. The eastern districts of Gondia, Bhandara, Gadchiroli and Nagpur are in earthquake zone 1, which has the least seismic activity in India, while other districts are in zone 2. Wainganga is the largest river in Vidarbha; along with its major tributaries, the Wardha, Kanhan, and Painganga, its waters flow south into the Godavari River.

Various incentives were granted to attract industries but have failed. Butibori Industrial Area MIDC outside Nagpur is one of the largest industrial areas in the country but few industries have opened there.

The Nagzira wildlife sanctuary and Navegoan Bandh National Park (bird sanctuary) of Gondia District are also very popular. The eastern region of Vidarbha contains Maharashtra's oldest National Park, the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, one of India's 39 Project Tiger Reserves. The National Park consists of two forested rectangles of the Tadoba and Andhari range. Aside from around 50 tigers, Tadoba Tiger Reserve is home to rare Indian wildlife like leopards, sloth bears, gaur, wild dogs, hyenas, civet, jungle cats, and many species of Indian deer such as sambar, cheetal, nilgai, and barking deer.

Nagpur district which has the highest population density is split into two lok sabha seats, Nagpur and Ramtek, while districts with lower population density like Chimur and Gadchiroli are clubbed together. Ramtek and Amravati seats are reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates only while Gadchiroli-Chimur is reserved for Scheduled Tribes. ===Representation in Vidhan Sabha=== Vidarbha is represented at state level by 62 Vidhan Sabha seats. Nagpur boasts the densest concentration of assembly seats with the city divided into six areas. Certain seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribe candidates only, while others are open to all. As part of the Nagpur Pact the winter session of Maharashtra assembly is held as Nagpur Vidhan Bhavan. ===Separate statehood movement=== Background: * 1853: Berar territory was taken from Nizam of Hyderabad as he was unable to pay dues of Subsidy Alliance. In 1853 \"Nagpur Province\" was formed with Nagpur as its capital. It was administered by a commissioner under the central government. * 1861: \"Central Province\" was formed by the British, with Nagpur as its capital. * 1903: On 1 October Berar was also placed under the administration of the commissioner of Central Provinces. It was now named \"Central Province and Berar\". * 1935: Government of India Act, passed by British parliament, formed provincial assembly to provide for an election. Central Province and Berar was kept a separate entity, with Nagpur as its capital. * 1950: When the Constitution of India went into effect in 1950, Central Province and Berar became Madhya Pradesh, with Nagpur as its capital. * 1956: \"Vidarbha State\" with Nagpur as its capital was recommended by the States Reorganisation Commission. Instead, the area was made part of Bombay State. * 1960: On 1 May Bombay State was dissolved and the \"Vidarbha State\" was merged with the newly formed Maharashtra State. In recent years there have been sporadic calls for Vidarbha to secede from Maharashtra. This is based on a feeling of being neglected by the Maharashtra state government and a desire to assert a distinct political identity. The region has been seen to have fallen behind others in Maharashtra in attracting investment and development funds, being comparatively poorly served by roads, irrigation facilities and educational institutions. However political movements for attaining statehood have failed to hold sway as their leaders have been considered opportunistic and corrupt. Vidarbha Rajya Party and Vidarbha Rajya Nirman Congress are very small political parties created by leaders that have split from national-level parties like Indian National Congress (INC). The only national party to officially support Vidarbha state is Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), which included this demand in its national manifesto. Politician and economist Dr. Shrikant Jichkar opposed separation of Vidarbha from Maharashtra, believing that it was not sustainable: \"If Vidarbha is hived off, we will have no funds from day one to run the new State. The region's share is burdened by a deficit and Monopoly Cotton Purchase Scheme, Employment Guarantee Scheme and such activity will immediately cease since we would not have money to pay salaries.\" He noted that income from available natural resources could not balance Mumbai's subsidies, and that Mumbai's cooperation was vital to any development\u2014in addition to the societal risks of dividing the Marathi-speaking state. ==See also== * Dehani lift irrigation scheme * List of cities in Vidarbha * List of Maratha dynasties and states * Manav Vikas Mission * Proposed states and territories of India ==References== ==External links== * Article regarding environment of Vidarbha by Dr. Heda * Tigertrails *National Park In Vidarbha * This details the history of the province up to 1903, and itself cites (Oxford, 1908) Category:Regions of India Category:Regions of Maharashtra Category:Proposed states and territories of India ",
