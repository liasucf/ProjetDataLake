    "text": "Biomedical Systems Corporation was a global company specializing in clinical trials services and medical devices to biopharmaceutical and healthcare organizations. ==History== Founded in 1975, Biomedical Systems offered centralized cardiac safety, medical imaging and respiratory services in drug development and also collected, analyzed and distributed electronic patient- reported outcome (ePRO) in multiple modalities across all phases of clinical research. In 2010 Biomedical Systems introduced their own Wireless Ambulatory ECG Monitoring System called the TruVue\u2122 Wireless Telemetry Device as part of their Cardiac Patient Services Business. TruVue would record and remotely transmit heartbeats for up to 30 days; and was intended for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmia. Biomedical Systems later sold TruVue to Malvern, Pennsylvania-based BioTelemetry, Inc. for $8.65 million. Later in 2012 Biomedical Systems added ePRO services through their acquisition of Belgium-based Symfo. On September 8, 2017, ERT announced its acquisition of Biomedical Systems. ==Locations== * Maryland Heights, Missouri (global headquarters) * Brussels, Belgium (European headquarters, established in 1981) * Tsukuba, Japan * Pondicherry, India * Beijing, China (partnership) == References == Category:Medical technology companies of the United States Category:Companies based in St. Louis Category:Health care companies established in 1975 Category:Electrodiagnosis Category:Medical imaging Category:Clinical data management Category:1975 establishments in Missouri Category:Technology companies disestablished in 2017 Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions Category:2017 disestablishments in Missouri ",
