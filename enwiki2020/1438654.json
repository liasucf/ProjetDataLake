    "text": "Pass the Flask is the first studio album released by American post-hardcore band the Bled. == Reissue == The Bled originally released their first album on Fiddler Records, an independent, now defunct record label. Pass the Flask sold approx 50,000 copies while on Fiddler. The Bled then signed to Vagrant Records to release their second album, Found in the Flood. They reissued the first album on their new label Vagrant Records, containing all of the songs from Pass the Flask, as well as the almost impossible to find His First Crush and The Bled EPs and officially unreleased tracks that only family and friends had. Jeremy Talley, the guitarist, said that \"it seemed like the right time to put them all on one disc and put it out there before too many people find out about the Internet.\"The bled - Pass The Flask (Reissue) .
