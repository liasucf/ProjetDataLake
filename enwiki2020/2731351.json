He succeeded Husham in the apparently elective kingship of the Edomites. He is described as having moved the capital of Edom to Avith, and of defeating the Midianites in Moab. He was succeeded by Samlah of Masrekah. According to David Mandel, Hadad's rule can be dated to the tenth century BCE. ==References== Category:Kings of Edom Category:Midian Category:Book of Genesis people ",
