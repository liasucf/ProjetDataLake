The word literally means First of May, i.e., May Day, in English and is sometimes transliterated as Parvomai or Purvomai. As with many places in Bulgaria, the town has other names, such as its old name (up until 1947) of Borisovgrad (after Bulgaria's last Tsar, Boris to celebrate his birthday on 30 January 1894), as well as Borisovgrad, Borissograd, Borissovgrade, or Borissowgrad. Until 1894, it was known by its Turkish names of Hadzi Ejles (Bulgarian \u0425\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438 \u0415\u043b\u0435\u0441), Hadzi-Ele, Hadzi-Jeiles, Khadzhi Eiles, or Khadzhi-Eles (\"Hac\u0131 \u0130lyas\" in Turkish). ==The Town== The municipal centre town Parvomay is situated at 134 meters above sea level, with geographic coordinates 25\u043e13`30`` East longitude and 42\u043e06`00`` North latitude.

The topography of the Parvomay Municipality is predominantly a flat plain with the exception being the fields of the Voden and Bukovo villages and the rolling hills around Iskra, Bryagovo, Dragoinovo and Ezerovo which are from the foothills of Dragoyna. The name of the ridge comes from a legend about Dragoy, prince of the Slavonic tribe that inhabited the region and his daughter Dragoyna, who built a white stone castle on the peak but the Byzantines conquered and destroyed her residence. This range is in turn the foothills of the Rhodopi mountains, passing to the South- West into the Novakovski Balkan mountain. In 1926, the population of the town was 4425 people, and in 1946 the town was 5050, by 1985 the population had risen to 17,136, by 1992 it had dropped to 16,826. The population of the town in 2009 was 16,630, by the end of 2010 it had fallen to 13,733. The settlement ranks the 57th largest cities of Bulgaria. Map of Parvomay municipality (Plovdiv Province) ==The Municipality== The Parvomay Municipality has its administrative centre in the town of Parvomay. The town is formed of three areas, Parvomay in the centre, Debar to the South and Liybenovo to the North east. The municipality is situated in the most Eastern area of the Plovdiv Pazadjik plain\u2013 part of the Upper Thracian lowlands, with total area of 470,057 decares. The Municipality encompasses 17 settlements with population of 32,131 people. Villages in Parvomay Municipality in the Plovdiv Province are; Bryagovo (789 inhabitants to 02/05/2006), Bukovo, Byala Reka, Dalbok Izvor, Dobri Do, Dragoynovo, Ezerovo, Gradina, Iskra, Karadjalovo. Iskra being the largest in the area with a population of 1829 (to 02/05/2006) in the Dragoyna foothills to the south of Parvomay. ==History== Fossils of sea shells have been found in the limestone rocks near the village of Ezerovo (to the south east of Parvomay town) a full skeleton of a prehistoric Deinotherium was also found in this area which is on display in Asenovgrad Paleontological Museum. Sometime from the 5th century BC to the 3rd century BC, this area became part of the Thracian Odrysian kingdom. In the quarters of Debar and Liybenovo on the outskirts of Parvomay town, archeologists have found Thracian mounds. By the 1st century AD, this part of Thrace was annexed by the Roman empire, and later it remained a part of its Eastern Roman Empire. Roman graves dating to the period of the 1st\u20134th centuries have been also discovered around Parvomay. Through the history of Bulgaria the area has been Thracian, Greek, Roman, Byzantium, Slav, Bulgar and Ottoman. There were archaeological finds in 2004 2005 and 2006 relating to a Thracian cult complex of a collection of tribes known as the Odrysian kingdom in an area to the south of Dragoynovo at the Goliama Dragoyna peak. The peak of Goliama Dragoyna is the highest point in the area at 813,60 m. The sub region of Dragoyna is believed to have been a local centre of the Thracian aristocracy within the Odryssian kingdom, possibly linked to Perperikon. A high concentration of Thracian tumulus (burial mounds) have been found in the area. A well known golden ring was found in Ezerovo,Comparative Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction by Robert S. P. Beekes,1995,Back matter,\"... Thracian \u2013 The gold ring with inscription from Ezerovo, ...\" near to Dragoyna archaeological site. The ring has an inscriptionThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans, the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, and E. Sollberger, 1982, page 878 in Thracian Language with Greek letters. It indicates that the relatives dedicate the ring to the deceased. Also found were numerous dice that resemble the modern dice used for playing. Playing dice has an ancient history and it seems that the inhabitants of Thrace were well acquainted with the game. A settlement, most probably related with the sanctuary, was located close to the village of Dragoynovo near to Iskra. This religious complex is one of the many sacred places, established by the Thracians on high mountain peaks. Sanctuaries of this type originated and developed as religious centres in the period between the Late Bronze Age and the end of the Roman Empire. The sanctuary complex on Dragoyna peak was first studied and recorded in the first half of the 20th century since when the site has suffered at the hands of numerous treasure hunters. No formal archaeological excavations were conducted until 2004. Two periods of occupation have been identified from the archaeological evidence: *13th century BC \u2013 5th century BC: the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, but also the Dark Ages in the Aegean and Anatolia. At this time, the hill had no floral and soil cover. The archaeological finds from the period are fireplaces, which served as altars for various fire-related rituals. *4th century BC \u2013 3rd century BC: the Late Iron Age or the period of Classics and Hellenism. In this period, the region of the Eastern Mediterranean had its cultural consolidation provoked by the military campaigns of the Macedonian rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great. This was also the period of the most active utilization of the sanctuary. In recent years archaeological excavations near village of Iskra four churches were discovered, this has increased speculation about the existence of a sizable religious centre. 1928 Chirpan earthquake \u2013 Voyvodinovo The oldest documented reference to the city Parvomay of 1576 it is in the register of Ottoman Taxes in Bulgaria. In 1671 the famous Turkish travel writer Evliya Celebi mentions Village Iskra to the South.
