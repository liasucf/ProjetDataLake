As a teenager in 2005, he signed a publishing deal in Los Angeles, set up his own record label, and released an album. He would later form a band called Finding Albert, and composed music for various film and television projects including Sky Sports. In mid-2016, he began releasing music under the ONR. moniker through the Los Angeles indie label, Leftwing. Soon after, he signed a record deal with Capitol Records.

In August 2020, ONR released \"Kill TV\" on Warner Records which featured legendary guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers. The two struck up a friendship after meeting at Abbey Road Studios. Rodgers said of working with ONR \"it was almost like Daft Punk, I played one song and after they were like, 'well, here's another one and here's another one'... after 'Kill TV' I said, 'Wow, this guy has really got something.'\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2020/09/27/behind- the-onr-and-nile-rodgers-teaming-on-infectious-kill-tv-single/#1509d0eb7b75 ONR has toured across Europe with artists including Bastille, Jake Bugg, Lewis Capaldi and Mondo Cozmo. ==Discography== ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of singles showing year released and album name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Jericho\" | rowspan=\"2\"|2017 | rowspan=\"4\"|\u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"5 Years Time\" |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"American Gods\" | rowspan=\"2\"|2018 |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Love In Suburbia\" |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Sober\" (featuring Carina Jade) | rowspan=\"2\"|2020 | rowspan=\"4\"|Must Stop EP |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Human Enough\" |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Kill TV\" (featuring Nile Rodgers) | rowspan=\"2\"|2020 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Warner Records artists Category:Scottish male singers Category:Scottish singer-songwriters Category:Scottish pop singers Category:21st-century Scottish singers Category:People from Dumfries Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:Scottish musicians Category:21st-century male singers ",
