The design featured an offset centre-cab arrangement using the same DML61Z diesel engine used in the Class DD51 locomotives, derated from to . ==History== The first two locomotives, DD16 1 and 2, were built at the Japanese National Railways (JNR) Nagano factory, and these were tested on the Koumi Line and Iida Line. Between 1979 and 1983, four locomotives (DD16 2, 5, 4, and 13) were converted at JNR's Nagano and Matto workshops to become self- propelled snowplough units, numbered DD16 301 to 304, with the addition of bogie snowplough units on either end.

With the privatization of JNR in April 1987, just ten Class DD16 locomotives remained in service, transferred to operation by JR Group operating companies. By 1 April 1995, seven locomotives were still in service, with four (DD16-0 and DD16-300) operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), two (DD16-0) operated by Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu), and one (DD16-300) operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
