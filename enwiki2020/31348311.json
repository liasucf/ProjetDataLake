    "text": "Den store barned\u00e5pen is a 1931 Norwegian comedy film. It was directed by Tancred Ibsen and featured Einar Sissener, Aase Bye and Unni Torkildsen. It was the first feature-length Norwegian sound film. It was based on the 1925 play of the same name written by Oskar Braaten (1881\u20131939). The lacklustre Harald (Sissener) is taken in by Alvilde (Bye), and charged with looking after her bastard child. It soon dawns on both of them that Harald has more potential than previously assumed. ==References== ==External links== * * * Den store barned\u00e5pen at the Norwegian Film Institute Category:1931 films Category:1931 comedy films Category:Norwegian films Category:Films directed by Tancred Ibsen Category:Norwegian black-and-white films Category:Norwegian comedy films ",
