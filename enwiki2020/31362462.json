    "text": "Disguises is the fifth studio album by American rock band Aiden. Disguises was recorded some time between 2010 and 2011. Unlike previous albums, Disguises has a large usage of gang vocals. It is also their last album with founding drummer Jake Davison. This is the only album by Aiden to not chart on Billboard Top 200, or any other chart. So far, three singles have been released. \"Walk Among the Dead\", \"Hysteria\" (the first music video of the album), and \"A Portrait of the Artist\", which was released on their personal YouTube channel \"Aidenvision\". The music video for \"Hysteria\", featuring lyrics critical of religion, shows William Francis singing in a priest's robe juxtaposed with stock footage of burning churches, religious leaders, and social unrest. The music video for \"A Portrait of the Artist\" shows the other Aiden band members kidnapping Francis and ultimately hanging him and notably features drummer Ryan Seaman wearing a bandanna in place of Davison. No video for the first single, \"Walk Among the Dead\" has been released. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Aiden=== * Jake Davison \u2013 drums * Zombie Nicholas \u2013 bass, background vocals * Angel Ibarra \u2013 lead guitar * Wil Francis \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar, piano ===Performers=== * Austin Held \u2013 additional vocals on \"ReEvolver\" * Ash Costello \u2013 additional vocals on \"Shine\" * Rick Kern \u2013 additional vocals * Jeremy Beddingfield \u2013 additional vocals * Allana Smith \u2013 additional vocals * Roya Nourani \u2013 additional vocals * Daniel Matson \u2013 additional vocals * Jamie Wheelock \u2013 additional vocals * Nicholas McMahan \u2013 additional vocals * Harry MacDonald \u2013 additional vocals ===Design=== * Chad Micheal Ward \u2013 cover photo * Ciera Walters \u2013 band photo * Doublej \u2013 layout design ===Technical=== * William Control \u2013 production, engineering, mixing * Joel Casey Jones \u2013 engineering assistant * Bob Bicknell \u2013 engineering assistant * Justin Armstrong \u2013 mixing == Release history == {|class=\"wikitable\" !
