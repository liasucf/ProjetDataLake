    "text": "Pardus is a Linux distribution developed with support from the government of Turkey. Pardus' main focus is office-related work including use in Turkish government agencies. Despite that, Pardus ships in several languages. Its ease of use and availability free of charge has spawned numerous communities throughout the world. == Development == Pardus was started by Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE), a division of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK). The first live CD version of Pardus was a fork of Gentoo Linux. The current version is a fork of Debian. == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Version ! Date !

It was used in the initial versions of the distribution, but abandoned in favor of APT since the project moved to Debian base. Pardus 2011.2, released on September 19, 2011, was the last Pardus release that used PiSi. PiSi stores and handles dependencies for various packages, libraries, and COMAR tasks. Some features of PiSi include: * Uses the LZMA compression algorithm * Written in Python * Package sources are written in XML and Python * Database access implemented with Berkeley DB * Integrates low-level and high-level package operations (dependency resolution) * Framework approach to build applications and tools upon A community fork of the old Pardus with PiSi package management exists, called PiSi Linux.DistroWatch.com: PiSi LinuxPisi Linux 1.2 Xfce don't love me none, DedoimedoPisi Linux 1.1 review | LinuxBSDos.com PiSi Linux's latest stable version is 1.2,Distribution Release: Pisi Linux 1.2 (DistroWatch.com News) and latest development version is 2.0 Beta 2.Development Release: Pisi Linux 2.0 Beta 2 (DistroWatch.com News) eopkg - the package manager of the Solus project, a rolling-release Linux distribution, is based on / derived from PiSi. == YALI == YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer) is the first Pardus software a user encounters. Basically, it recognizes the hardware and installs Pardus software from installation media (i.e. CD) to a user-selected hard disk partition. YALI can handle resizing of NTFS partitions found on the disk. A yal\u0131 is a waterside mansion common in the Bosphorus region. This project is stopped and not being used since the migration to Debian-base. == KAPTAN == KAPTAN is a desktop greeter, which starts at the first start. It allows a user to change the desktop theme, mouse, keyboard and language settings, date and time, KDE menus, wallpaper, Package Manager settings, smolt, number of desktops.
