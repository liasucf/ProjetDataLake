This year, the Women's Rights Art Exhibition marked EVAW day in China in a unique manner. Art has a way of bringing light on issues in a subtle but yet provoking manner. Art, in most cases, is that voice that breaks the silence for us when we are not brave enough to do it on our own, or when we simply need a voice stronger than our own. The art displayed in this exhibition has done just that. Domestic violence has never been a topic that is easy to speak about. The stigmatization that surrounds it often forces victims, families, and societies to resort to silence and isolation. Fortunately, through the efforts of local governments, NGOs and the international community over the past decade, this situation is slowly changing in China. Domestic violence is becoming a matter of public concern.\" - Julie Broussard Country Director for UN WOMEN ===Discussions=== Many guests such as filmmakers, authors, activists, journalists, and diplomats participate in discussions at the Crossroads Centre, where they share their knowledge and encourage the audience to challenge their beliefs and consider new ideas.Journal, Synthetic. \"Art Salon at Crossroads Centre Beijing: He Hongbei\", Synthetic Journal, Beijing, 18 November 2014.
