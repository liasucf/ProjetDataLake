    "text": "Hannah Milhous Nixon (March 7, 1885 - September 30, 1967) was the mother of President Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon described his mother as \"a Quaker saint\". On May 9, 1970 (Richard Nixon's visit to the Lincoln Memorial), Nixon insisted on stopping at the United States Capitol, where he took his former seat in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives and instructed his valet Manolo Sanchez to make a speech. Sanchez spoke of his pride in being a citizen of the United States and Nixon and some female cleaners who were present applauded. One of the women present, Carrie Moore, asked Nixon to sign her bible, which he did, and holding her hand told her that his mother \"was a saint\" and \"you be a saint too\". Hannah Nixon is acknowledged to have exerted a tremendous effect on her son's outlook throughout his life.\"Richard M. Nixon\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica In Richard Nixon's final remarks at the White House on August 9, 1974, he stated about her, \"Nobody will ever write a book, probably, about my mother. Well, I guess all of you would say this about your mother \u2013 my mother was a saint. And I think of her, two boys dying of tuberculosis, nursing four others in order that she could take care of my older brother for 3 years in Arizona, and seeing each of them die, and when they died, it was like one of her own. Yes, she will have no books written about her. But she was a saint.\" ==Early life== She was born Hannah Elizabeth Milhous near Butlerville, Indiana, the daughter of Almira Park (n\u00e9e Burdg; 1849-1943), who was from Columbiana County, Ohio, and Franklin Milieus (1848-1919), a native of Colerain Township, Belmont County, Ohio. ==Family== She was married to Francis A.
