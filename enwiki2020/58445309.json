    "text": "The 2019 AFL Women's season was the third season of the elite women's Australian rules football competition. Ten teams competed in the league, two more than the previous season, all of which are associated with existing Australian Football League (AFL) clubs. To accommodate the extra teams a conference system was implemented. The first game was played on the 2nd of February and the season concluded with the 2019 AFL Women's Grand Final between Adelaide and Carlton on the 31st of March. Adelaide won by a margin of 45 to win their second premiership. ==Reforms== ===New teams=== Two new teams, and , joined the competition, bringing the total number of teams to ten. The North Melbourne team has a strong Tasmanian focus; some players are based in Tasmania and some home games were held in the state. The introduction of the new teams is the first stage of a two-year expansion that will take the league to fourteen teams for the 2020 season. ===Conferences=== Despite the introduction of new teams, the league retained a seven-round home-and-away season. This was achieved by splitting the competition into two conferences. Each team play four games against their fellow conference members and three \"cross-over\" matches against teams from the other conference. Conference membership was based on the final ladder positions of the 2018 season. The finals series was expanded to include preliminary finals for the first time; the two teams who finish the highest in each conference at the end of the home-and-away season qualified for the preliminary finals. The winners of these games played in the AFL Women's Grand Final. The make-up of the conferences, along with the fixture, was released in October 2018. The conference system proved controversial as the teams in Conference A consistently outplayed the teams on Conference B, resulting in the first, second, fifth and sixth best overall teams making the finals. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- !colspan=3|Pool A |- !
