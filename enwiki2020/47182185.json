He had multiple top-10 finishes in the Open Championship. His best result was fifth in the 1909 Open Championship. Renouf caddied in his youth at Royal Jersey Golf Club and became a skilled club maker as well as a manufacturer of golf balls. ==Early life== Thomas Renouf was born in Grouville, Jersey. He learned the game by starting out as a caddie and also developed skills as a club and ball maker. Thomas's younger brother, Francis (Frank) George Renouf, was also a professional golfer. Frank was killed in France in 1915 in World War I. ==Golf career== Renouf (left) watches Harry Vardon putt in a match at Silloth-on- Solway Golf Club in 1898. By the age of 17, and barely speaking any English, he had turned professional and traveled to the north of England taking a job at the Roundhay Golf Club in Leeds. After a few intermediate stops at different clubs he was posted at Silloth in 1898 where he remained for 8 years. At Silloth he was a teacher and mentor of the great lady golfer Cecil Leitch. When the British PGA was formed in 1901, Renouf was a founding member. Renouf left Silloth for Trafford Park, Manchester in 1906, and remained there until 1929. During his tenure at Trafford Park he began designing golf courses\u2014particularly in the north of England\u2014and added the layout of the Alderley Edge course to his resum\u00e9. Renouf had a number of regional tournament successes while he was posted at Trafford Park; wins included the Manchester Courier Cup in 1910 and 1930 and the Manchester Despatch Trophy in 1924. His abilities on the golf course as a successful and highly competent professional were clear after he had six caps for England between 1903 and 1912. He had an excellent record in matches against Scotland, scoring wins in 7 of 10 matches played. ===1909 Open Championship=== In the 1909 Open Championship, held 10\u201311 June at Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club in Deal, Kent, England, Renouf carded rounds of 76-78-76-73=302 finishing in fifth place and won \u00a37 10s. J.H. Taylor won the tournament with scores of 74-73-74-74=295. ===News of the World Tournament=== At the age of 45\u2014by which time he had moved to Stockport Golf Club\u2014he reached the final of the important News of the World Tournament in 1923 at Walton Heath having beaten Arthur Havers on his way to the final match which, unfortunately, he lost to Reg Wilson. ===Leeds Cup=== Renouf finished second in the 1911 Leeds Cup Tournament at Roundhay Golf Club, losing by one stroke to Ted Ray. His tenacity paid off in 1914 when he won the event by two strokes from three runners-up at Northumberland Golf Club. ===Northern Professional Championship=== He won the 1920 Northern Professional Championship and repeated the feat in 1929 at Pleasington Golf Club in Blackburn. ==Death and legacy== In 1929, Renouf was posted at Stockport Golf Club at Torkington where, just before his retirement in 1938, he played a 36-hole exhibition match against Henry Cotton. He was named captain of the British PGA in 1931\u201332. He is perhaps best remembered for his consistent, steady performances in the Open Championship which included numerous top-10 finishes. Renouf died at Marple, Cheshire, England, on 14 July 1955 at the age of 77. ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1897 !1898 !1899 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |T14 |style=\"background:yellow;\"|9 |T12 |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1900 !1901 !1902 !1903 !1904 !1905 !1906 !1907 !1908 !1909 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T12 |T20 |WD |23 |T16 |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8 |T17 |T28 |style=\"background:yellow;\"|5 |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1910 !1911 !1912 !1913 !1914 !1915 !1916 !1917 !1918 !1919 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T8 |T13 |19 |style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1920 !1921 !1922 !1923 !1924 !1925 !1926 !1927 !1928 !1929 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T43 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |} Note: Renouf only played in The Open Championship.
