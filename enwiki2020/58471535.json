    "text": "The 2019 Tim Hortons Brier, Canada's national men's curling championship, was held from March 2 to 10 at Westoba Place in Brandon, Manitoba. In the final, Kevin Koe of Alberta defeated Team Wildcard skipped by Brendan Bottcher 4\u20133 by scoring two in the tenth end to win. It was the lowest scoring Brier final since 1992, which was held before the adoption of any free guard zone rule. The Koe rink represented Canada at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship held from March 30 to April 7 at the ENMAX Centre in Lethbridge, Alberta. This marked the third time the Brier has been held in Brandon, the first time since 1982. This year's Brier was notable for a total team shot percentage efficiency for Northern Ontario of 97% during Draw 3 on March 3, tying a Brier record. ==Teams== The teams are as follows: {| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 !bgcolor=\"#ff7799\" width=\"250\"| Canada !bgcolor=\"#0055ff\" width=\"250\"| Alberta !bgcolor=\"#0099ff\" width=\"250\"| British Columbia !bgcolor=\"#ffff99\" width=\"250\"| Manitoba |- |Bally Haly G&CC; & Re/Max Centre, St. John's Skip: Brad Gushue Third: Mark Nichols Second: Brett Gallant Lead: Geoff Walker Alternate: Tom Sallows |The Glencoe Club, Calgary Skip: Kevin Koe Third: B.J.
