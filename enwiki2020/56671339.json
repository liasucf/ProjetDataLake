The scenes, audio, and timelines were collaborated between the departments. Sam Deane created a game engine from scratch to present the scenes. Simon Jenkins wrote the natural language engine for the in-game instant message application. The writing was aided by academics of philosophy to ensure realism and accuracy. == Plot and gameplay == The player explores philosophical concepts through the eyes of the 14 year old Sophie. The title contains an in-game encyclopaedic database. == Critical reception == Ray Ivey of Just Adventure described it as short, imaginative, and delicious. Quandaryland's Steve Ramsey wrote that while the game only took an hour to complete, he didn't have a desire to stay in the world for longer. At the 1997 Bima Awards, the British Interactive Multimedia Association presented the game with a craft award for sound and music. == References == Category:Educational video games Category:1997 video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games ",
