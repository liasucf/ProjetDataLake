    "text": "The Local Court of New South Wales is the lowest court in the judicial hierarchy of the Australian state of New South Wales. Formerly known as the Court of Petty Sessions and the Magistrates Court, there are more than 160 branches across New South Wales where the Local Court has jurisdiction to deal with the majority of minor civil and criminal matters. Matters are heard before a single magistrate sitting without a jury, addressed as \"Your Honour\" or \"Sir\" (but no longer \"Your worship\"). The Local Court has no jurisdiction for claims in equity. On appeal, matters may be heard by the District Court of New South Wales including appeals against the sentence or conviction decided in the Local Court. The Chief Magistrate of the Local Court is Judge Graeme Henson, appointed in 2006. ==History== In 1788, following the landing of the First Fleet and establishment of the Colony of New South Wales, the power and authority of the first criminal and civil courts in the Colony of New South Wales were vested by the Charter of Justice.Charter of Justice 2 April 1787 (UK) The first Court of Petty Session's courthouse was constructed in 1821 at Windsor, northwest of Sydney. ==Structure and jurisdiction== The Local Court of New South Wales hears civil matters of a monetary value of up to $100,000; mental health matters; family law and/or child care matters; adult criminal proceedings, including committal hearings, and summary prosecutions for summary offences (i.e., offences of a less serious nature) and indictable offences; licensing issues (as the Licensing Court); industrial matters; and mining matters. In addition to this, the Local Court, via its Small Claims Division, hears claims for less than $10,000 and also hears applications for Apprehended Violence Orders (AVOs).

The Coroner's Court is another division within the Local Court that investigates violent or unnatural deaths, suspicious fires and/or explosions, but it cannot make orders to punish offenders.
