    "text": "\"Feels Like Tonight\" is the fourth main single (sixth overall) from American rock band Daughtry's debut album. The song is a power ballad in the vein of the band's previous hit, \"Home\". The official release date for the track in the U.S. was January 8, 2008. ==Background== Shortly after releasing the band's first compilation album It's Not Over...The Hits So Far, frontman Chris Daughtry spoke with Entertainment Weekly about his original distaste for the song and eventual acceptance, saying > Max Martin and Dr. Luke had written this song and it was actually one of two > songs that I\u2019ve recorded that I didn\u2019t write anything on. I didn\u2019t work with > those guys. I remember it being very close to the end of the record making > process [for 2006\u2019s self-titled debut] and I remember getting this song and > I was like, 'No, no, I\u2019m not cutting it, it\u2019s way too pop. It\u2019s so not with > the rest of the record.' I was really being a bull about it. I remember > being told, 'This was the song that they wrote for you had you won the > show.' And I was like, 'Well now I definitely don\u2019t want to do it!' Anyway, > I appeased them and I recorded it and then I remember hearing it back and > going 'OK, you were right, this was definitely a good idea.' And it became > one of our bigger songs. I still don\u2019t know what it means. ==Music video== The music video was shot under director Martin Weisz. The video debuted Monday, January 14, 2008 on Amazon.com.Official Music Video The video begins with the band playing in a barren desert in the daytime. When the first chorus starts, clouds are shown racing by and it suddenly changes to nighttime. After the end of the chorus the clouds clear and it is daytime again, however the band is now playing in a forest setting. When the chorus starts for the second time, it again becomes night and Chris is shown walking out of the forest through a door. When he emerges the band is waiting for him on a city rooftop, it being daytime. Upon the third and final chorus, it once again becomes night and the band is shown playing on the rooftop with the lit up skyscrapers of the city behind them. It was noted that the band shot for 48 hours straight in 3 locations north of LA on this video, because of their touring schedule. As soon as the video was finished, the director realized he forgot the time lapse footage, and went back to the desert to shoot that footage again, this time without the band. Contrary to popular belief, the director & crew did not sleep for 3 whole days. ==In popular culture== The song was used for WWE's annual Tribute to the Troops special in 2007. It was originally planned to be the end credits song to National Treasure: Book of Secrets but was cut at the last minute. The instrumental version of the song is played in the commercials for the film Charlie Wilson's War. The song appeared in the January 28, 2008 episode of the seventh season of American Idol. TV5 used the song during the 5 Max Movies' commercial breaks in 2008 and 2009.
