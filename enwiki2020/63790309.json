Following his performance, critic Bo\u017eo Beni\u0107 stated \"Ozren Grabari\u0107 does not only delve subtly into wit of Dr\u017ei\u0107, but also presents the layered, defiant and reproachful world of the poet's theater and philosophy, but almost with shocking ease plays all the characters from Dr\u017ei\u0107's literary legacy, including Negromant, the Long Nose, Pomet Trpeza, Stanac and Gri\u017eula.\" Grabari\u0107 cited actors Maro Martinovi\u0107 and Doris \u0160ari\u0107-Kukuljica as significant help in adopting the 15th-century dialect of Dubrovnik.
