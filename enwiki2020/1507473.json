    "text": "Morris Clyde Lewis III (born October 21, 1969) is a former American football linebacker who played in the National Football League for 13 seasons with the New York Jets. After playing college football at the University of Georgia, Lewis was selected by the Jets in the third round of the 1991 NFL Draft. He was named to three Pro Bowls and was a first-team All-Pro during his career, in addition to being a member of the Jets All-Time Four Decade Team. ==Career== Lewis was a star at the University of Georgia, wearing the number 57 as he would in his pro career. Lewis played 200 games as a Jet, the third- longest tenure in franchise history, and was one of the most loved team players and captains of his time. He was a three-time Pro Bowler (1998, 1999, 2000), was the Jets' defensive captain from 1997 to 2003 and was named to the NFL All-Pro team after the 1998 season. Lewis retired after the 2003 season with 1,231 tackles (883 solo), 52.5 sacks, 14 interceptions for 241 yards, 79 pass deflections, 29 forced fumbles, 13 fumble recoveries for 74 yards and five defensive touchdowns in 200 career games. While Lewis would have a productive career, his accomplishments would be overshadowed during a 2001 game against the New England Patriots when he injured the Patriots' starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Bledsoe's injury resulted in Tom Brady becoming New England's quarterback, beginning the Brady\u2013Belichick era for the Patriots that saw them enjoy nearly two decades of dominance and win six Super Bowl titles. As a result, Lewis' hit on Bledsoe is often noted for its impact on NFL history. The hit appeared on the NFL's list of 100 greatest game changers, ranking at 82. ==Personal life== Lewis and his wife Christalyn live in Atlanta, Georgia and have two sons. Both of his sons play basketball; Mo IV plays at the United States Naval Academy and the younger, Chris, is committed to play for Harvard. Lewis has thought about coaching but instead decided to work out young athletes near Atlanta.Casey, Tim. \"With Eye on Harvard, Basketball Player Has 2 Careers on His Mind Chris Lewis Heeds Parents\u2019 Advice in College Decision.\" The New York Times January 30, 2015: n. pag.
