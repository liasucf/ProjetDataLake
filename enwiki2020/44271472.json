    "text": "In November 2014 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) will hold a total of five CMLL Super Viernes shows on Friday nights as they have not currently announced any special events to replace their regular Friday night shows. Some of the matches from Super Viernes are taped for CMLL's weekly shows that air on television in Mexico in the following week. The Super Viernes events features a varying number of professional wrestling matches, in which some wrestlers were involved in pre- existing scripted feuds or storylines and others were teamed up with no backstory reason as such. Wrestlers themselves portrayed either villains (referred to as \"Rudos\" in Mexico) or fan favorites (\"Tecnicos\" in Mexico) as they competed in matches with pre-determined outcomes. ==November 7, 2014== Mexican Lucha libre, or professional wrestling, promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held their Super Viernes show on November 7, 2014 at Arena M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The Main Event of the six-match show was a six- man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match with the trio of Los Ingobernables (\"The Unruly\"; La M\u00e1scara, La Sombra and Rush) will face the team of Thunder and Los Guerreros Lagunero (\"The Warriors from the Lagoon\"; Euforia and \u00daltimo Guerrero), continuing a month-long storyline feud between the two sides. Valiente was originally scheduled to participate in the fifth match of the night but on the Tuesday before the show CMLL announced that Diamante Azul would take his place with no explanation for the substitution. In the opening match third-generation wrestler Robin, son of Brazo de Plata and grandson of Shadito Cruz, teamed up with second-generation wrestler Star, Jr., son of Star Boy to defeat the rudo (the bad guys) team of Akuma and Disturbio two falls to one to start off the show. In the second match of the night CMLL had originally announced that Cachorro would compete in a Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match, but on the night of the show he was by Stigma without explanation. Stigma teamed up with Dragon Lee and Oro, Jr. for a match against Nitro and La Fievre Amarilla (\"The Yellow Wave\"; Okumura and Kamaitachi). During the match Dragon Lee and Kamaitachi focused their attention on each other, continuing an emerging storyline feud between the two. In the end Kamaitachi pinned Dragon Lee to take the victory for his team. The fourth match of the night ended in a disqualification as B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario fouled Blue Panther about eight minutes into the match. Following the match Cavernario challenged Blue Panther to put his hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \"bet match\". This challenge to a \"hair vs. hair\" match followed similar challenges on the previous week's Super Viernes between Blue Panther and Rey Bucanero as well as M\u00e1ximo and El Felino as well as the steadily evolving storyline between the unmasked Rush and \u00daltimo Guerrero. These challenges could potentially lead to a multi-man steel cage match later in the year where everyone would risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The hair challenges were repeated after the fifth match where M\u00e1ximo, along with Diamante Azul and Volador Jr. defeated La Peste Negra (\"The Black Plague\"; Negro Casas, El Felino and Mr. Niebla). The main event marked the fifth week in a row that Los Ingobernables have faced off against \u00daltimo Guerrero and various members of Los Guerreros Lagunero (\"The Warriors from the Lagoon\"). For this match Guerrero teamed up with Euforia and non-Lagunero wrestler Thunder to take on the Unruly trio of Rush, La Sombra and La M\u00e1scara. The Rudo trio of Guerrero, Euforia and Thunder cheated to win the third and deciding fall of the match to close the show. ===November 7, 2014 Results=== ==November 14, 2014== Mexican Lucha libre, or professional wrestling, promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held their Super Viernes show on November 14, 2014 at Arena M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The main event was scheduled to be a rematch from the previous week's Super Viernes as Los Ingobernables (\"The Unruly\"; La M\u00e1scara, La Sombra and Rush) going up against Thunder and Los Guerreros Lagunero (Euforia and \u00daltimo Guerrero) after Thunder and Los Guerreros cheated to win the previous week. The day before the Super Viernes show Rush was injured during a match when he broke two bones in his leg and thus was unable to perform on the Super Viernes show. CMLL replaced him with Marco Corleone, someone who had teamed extensively with Rush in the past, even holding the CMLL World Trios Championship with La M\u00e1scara and M\u00e1ximo. The makeshift duo came to the ring showing signs of unity with both La M\u00e1scara and La Sombra wearing ring gear in red, white and green, the color both of the Mexican and Italian flag for Marco Corleone. During the match Marco also displayed more of the Ingobernables aggressive style of wrestling instead of his normal tecnico (\"good guy\") style and attitude. In the third and deciding fall Los Ingobernables rushed in the ring when Corleone was about to pin \u00daltimo Guerrero and attacked their partner. The confusion allowed Guerrero to land a low blow on Corleone to win the match. After the match Los Ingobernables left the ring, not caring that they lost while Marco Corleone took the microphone and challenged \u00daltimo Guerrero to put his hair on the line in a match between the two. The hair vs. hair or Lucha de Apuestas challenge after the main event was one of several that had been made over the previous three weeks and tied directly into the fourth match of the night, a 10-man torneo cibernetico elimination match. Vangelis was originally scheduled to appear but he was replaced by Hechicero on the night of the show with no explanation given. The rudo team (bad guys) consisted of Hechicero, B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario, El Felino, Rey Bucanero and El Terrible going against the tecnico team of Atlantis, Blue Panther, M\u00e1scara Dorada, M\u00e1ximo and Volador Jr.. The match includes several wrestlers who have challenged people to put their hair on the line in Lucha de Apuestas, or \"bet matches\" on previous Super Viernes shows. Of the group only Atlantis, Hechicero and M\u00e1scara Dorada are masked, allowing CMLL to build more tension between the seven unmasked wrestlers as they possibly prepare for a multi-man Luchas de Apuestas match at a later date. Hechicero, the replacement was the first man eliminated from the match as M\u00e1scara Dorada pinned him. Following the first elimination Atlantis and M\u00e1scara Dorada were eliminated, leaving the seven unmasked wrestlers in the match to fight it out. The order of elimination from that point on was Blue Panther, eliminated by B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario; B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario by M\u00e1ximo; Felino by M\u00e1ximo; M\u00e1ximo by Rey Bucanero; El Terrible by Volador Jr.; M\u00e1ximo by Rey Bucanero and El Terrible by Volador Jr. The match came down to Volador Jr. and Rey Bucanero, with El Terrible helping Bucanero win the match. Following the match the unmasked competitors fought in and out of the ring and finally repeated hair vs. hair challenges that had been made previously. The day after the show CMLL posted a video announcing the December 5th Infierno en el Ring show, which will feature a multi-man steel cage match where the loser would be shaved bald as a result. The video did not name specific competitors but did include footage of Negro Casas, El Felino, M\u00e1ximo, B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario, Blue Panther, \u00daltimo Guerrero, Rush and Volador Jr. hinting at possible competitors in the main event. The November 14th Super Viernes show was the first time \u00c1ngel de Oro appeared on the show after he won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship a few months earlier. \u00c1ngel de Oro teamed up with Mexican National Welterweight Champion Tit\u00e1n and Valiente taking on Mexican National Light Heavyweight Champion Mephisto teaming up with his regular partner Ephesto as well as Japanese wrestler Kamaitachi for a Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match. During the match Mephisto tried on multiple occasions to pin \u00c1ngel de Oro while using the ropes for an illegal advantage, but in the end \u00c1ngel de Oro gave Mephisto a taste of his own medicine, pinning him while HE himself held onto the ropes for leverage. After the show CMLL indicated that the interaction between \u00c1ngel de Oro and Mephisto was more than an isolated incident as they announced the two facing off in a Lightning Match on the following week's Super Viernes show. Following the third match Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and Hernandez, two non-CMLL wrestlers came to the ring to promote a show called \"All Elite\" that featured a number of CMLL wrestlers working with wrestlers on the Mexican independent circuit. The opening match marked only the second time luchador Esfinge appeared on a Super Viernes show, having first appeared on the September 26 Super Viernes. In his second appearance he teamed up with Stigma and gained his first victory as the duo defeated Disturbio and Nitro in the first match of the night. ===November 14, 2014 Results=== ==November 21, 2014== Mexican Lucha libre, or professional wrestling, promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) will hold their next Super Viernes show on November 21, 2014 at Arena M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, Mexico. Three of the scheduled six matches will include two or more competitors currently involved in various storylines where they have been making repeated challenges for their opponents to bet their hair in a Lucha de Apuestas all leading up to a multi-man steel cage match slated to be the main event of CMLL's 2014 Infierno en el Ring show on December 5. No names were confirmed for the show before the November 21st Super Viernes show. In the main event two rumored Infierno en el Ring competitors are on opposite sides of a Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match; \u00daltimo Guerrero and Volador Jr.. Guerrero will team up with Thunder and Euforia as he had for several weeks while Volador Jr. will team up with Guerrero's long time rival Atlantis as well as Valiente. Volador Jr. and Guerrero will be the only unmasked wrestlers in the match and the only two likely to compete in the Infierno en el Ring match out of that group. The previous week Marco Corleone challenged Guerrero to a hair match, but Corleone is not scheduled to appear on the show. All unmasked competitors scheduled for the third and fourth match have in some way been making \"hair vs. hair\" challenges in the preceding weeks, making it possible that Blue Panther, Rey Bucanero, B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario, El Felino, M\u00e1ximo, Shocker, El Terrible and Vangelis could all end up in the cage match. In the fourth match of the night CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion \u00c1ngel de Oro is set to face off against Mexican National Light Heavyweight Champion Mephisto, continuing on the storyline that was started the previous week, potentially leading to a featured match between the two at Infierno en el Ring. ===November 21, 2014 Results=== ==November 28, 2014== The November 29, 2014 Super Viernes lucha libre (professional wrestling) show will be the 45th Super Viernes of 2014 and the last show before CMLL's holds an annual major show called Infierno en el Ring. ===Results=== ==References== Category:2014 in professional wrestling Category:CMLL Super Viernes ",
