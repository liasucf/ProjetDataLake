    "text": "Cydias (), a native of Cythnus, who was living in 364 BC, may be presumed to have been a painter of considerable ability, as one of his pictures, representing 'Jason and his followers embarking for Colchis, in search of the Golden Fleece,' was purchased at Rome by the orator Hortensius for 144,000 sesterces. Afterwards the work was bought by Marcus Agrippa and placed in the Porticus of Neptune to commemorate his naval victories. He also seems to have been a somewhat famous poet as in the Charmides, Socrates attributes a homoerotic verse to him.http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/charmides.html Socrates quotes this verse while describing his lust for Charmides's youthful body. As the painter started working later in Plato's own life, this Cydias may refer to a different unspecified person. ==Poetry== * \"not to bring the fawn in the sight of the lion to be devoured by him\" - fragment of unspecified poem ==References== Attribution: * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Ancient Greek painters Category:People from Kythnos Category:4th-century BC Greek people Category:Ancient Greek poets Category:Ancient LGBT people Category:LGBT history in Greece Category:LGBT people from Greece Category:LGBT writers from Greece Category:Writers of lost works ",
