P. acidigallici is able to degrade trihydroxybenzenes.Fermentation of trihydroxybenzenes by Pelobacter acidigallici gen. nov. sp. nov., a new strictly anaerobic, non-sporeforming bacterium. Bernhard Schink and Norbert Pfennig, Archives of Microbiology, Volume 133, Number 3 / december 1982, pp. 195-201, The enzyme pyrogallol hydroxytransferase uses 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (pyrogallol), whereas its two products are 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol) and 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene.
