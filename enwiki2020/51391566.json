    "text": "Trevor Christensen (born 12 May 1993), known professionally as Said the Sky, is an American electronic dance music producer, DJ and musician. == Early life == At the age of 8, Christensen went for piano lessons which he had disliked. He quit the lessons after several years but later rejoined it while he was in middle school, along picking up other instruments to learn. He first got into electronic dance music by learning about the production at a Digital Audio Production class in high school. Christensen uses Ableton to produce music. Previously, he used Logic Pro. He attended Berklee College Of Music where he took a lot of beginner/intermediate courses such as music theory, ear training and lessons, prior to launching the 'Said the Sky' project, despite failing to participate in their production program. == History == === 2014: Debut extended play === Christensen was signed by Phase Management, who he was introduced to at a music festival in the summer of 2014. He knew and was inspired by some of the artists under Phase Management, which motivated him to sign for them. On June 8, 2014, he self-released his debut EP Faith. Tyler Trew of YourEDM reviewed the EP stating, \"He plays into both of his strengths, utilizing piano heavily throughout his productions in conjunction with superior sound design, most notably in the neuro basses that can be found in all of his singles on Faith. You get the most bass with \"Everything\" which starts off the EP quite perfectly and ever so celestially; piano and an inspiring vocal speech lead you into what is to come. That being some of the most beautifully epic music you are going to hear.\" === 2015: Singles === On July 9, 2015, Christensen released four singles including two collaborations with Illenium onto iTunes. The singles are \"Falling In\", \"In Your Wake\", \"Run Away\" and \"Book of Us\". Speaking about his collaboration and tours with Illenium, Christensen said touring with him was a 'dream come true' and he had never thought of doing so at that time in his life. On July 17, 2015, he released \"Espy\" as a single and four days later, he released an EP titled Painted White with Illenium and Cristina Soto. On July 30, 2015, he released three singles \"Disciple\", \"For You\" and \"Everything\" where the first two features Melissa Hayes. He released four more singles later in the year, titled \"Darling\", \"Nostalgia\", \"Listen\" and \"Mountains\". Missio features on \"Darling\" and \"Nostalgia\" whereas Diamond Eyes features on \"Mountains\". \"Disciple\", \"Everything\" and \"Listen\" are singles from his EP Faith. === 2016: Collaborations === On January 22, 2016, he released his first single of the year \"Ares\". In August 2016, it was revealed that Christensen collaborated with Illenium and Seven Lions for a song that was debuted at Das Energi Festival 2016. Christensen has supported Illenium on his headline tour across the United States. On 30 April 2016, Christensen performed at Denver's Gothic Theatre, he also toured with Illenium, who also performed at Denver. On 10 October 2016, he released a single with DJs Illenium and Seven Lions titled \"Rush Over Me\" featuring the vocals of Haliene. The song was first premiered by Illenium during a live show at Das Energi in Salt Lake City, Utah, in August. On 14 October 2016, he collaborated with fellow DJ 3LAU to release the single \"Fire\" featuring N\u00c9ONH\u00c8ART. Speaking in an interview, 3LAU said that Christensen sent him a \"fantastic piano riff, and (they) built the song out of that\". All revenue generated from Christensen's and 3LAU's collaborative single \"Fire\" will be donated to PoP, a non-profit organization that \"builds schools and expands educational opportunities in the developing world.\" The song's genre is future bass. The song was released via 3LAU's non-profit record label, Blume. An official music video was uploaded by popular music channel, Proximity, on 14 November 2016 which has garnered over 200,000 views. On 16 November 2016, Christensen released a remix of The Chainsmokers' second song off their EP \"Collage\", titled \"All We Know\". In 2017 he co-produced \"Where'd U Go\" with Illenium (available on Illenium's album \"Awake\"). In 2018 he recorded his first studio album \u00ab Wide-Eyed \u00bb including collaborations with Dabin and Matthew Koma. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" data-ve- attributes=\"{\"style\":\"text-align:center;\"}\" !
