    "text": "Anne Walker (1933 - ) is an American artist, primarily known for printmaking and painting. In 2001, Walker was named a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres by French Minister of Culture Catherine Tasca. Walker lives and works in Paris and has exhibited widely in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, and the United States. ==Early life and education== Walker was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1933. Walker graduated in 1955 from Smith College. She spent her junior year in Paris, working at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Montparnasse. In 1956 she returned to Paris to study with Johnny Friedlaender at his atelier; her first etchings were done there. == Career == Walker continued to make prints, create etchings, and a number of fine-press books in Paris. To date, she has made more than 330 prints, as well as a number of fine-press books illustrated with etchings. Since the 1960s Walker has been participating in group, collective, and solo exhibitions in France and abroad. In Paris, she has been involved in the Salon de Mai, the Salon de la Jeune Gravure Contemporaine and the Salon d'Automne, of which she was a member for a time. In 1986 Walker took up painting, using gouache combined with pastel, a technique that has predominated in her work since then. With these materials she began exploring the format of the artist\u2019s book, which has allowed her to collaborate with poets and writers whom she admires, including Michel Butor, Kenneth Koch and Peter Davison (poet), to name a few. Much of her book work is concerned with the language of color and is characterized by a lyricism that pairs well with literature. Walker also illustrated single-copy, or very limited edition books, and worked on \"painted books\" over texts by writers such as Bernard No\u00ebl, Jean Cortot, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Baudelaire, Walt Whitman, Arthur Rimbaud and Eug\u00e8ne Guillevic. Her solo exhibition Anne Walker: Painted Books at the Boston Athenaeum in 2003 featured handwritten poems by an impressive roster of writers: Emily Dickinson, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and others, including the artist herself and one of her major collectors and collaborators, Edward Kessler. A major exhibition in 2005 Poetics of Color: Books by Anne Walker featured thirty-two artist's books\u2013likened to poetic jewel boxes\u2013which she donated to the Mortimer Rare Book Collection at Smith College on the occasion of her 50th college reunion.Exhibition brochure for Poetics of Color: Books by Anne Walker, Neilson Library, Smith College, 8 November 2005\u201328 February 2006. Walker\u2019s work has continued to be recognized in both group and solo exhibitions in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia and the United States and her painted books have been acquired by major libraries and museums in those countries. == Personal life == Walker and her husband, Bertrand Dorny who is also an artist, have two children, both professionally engaged in publishing.Exhibition brochure for Anne Walker: Painted Books, Neilson Library, Smith College, 10 October\u201330 November 1994. == Awards == On December 11, 2001 Catherine Tasca, the French Minister of Culture, made Anne Walker-Dorny a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et Lettres in recognition of her creation in the artistic domain and her contribution to culture in France and in the world. == Exhibitions == === Collective Exhibitions === * 1960 Boston Printmakers * 1971 Cracow Biennale * 1975-1976 Toulon International Festival * 1980 Biennale d'Art Contemporain, Brest * 1981 Grass and Tree ( Herbe et Arbre) at the Centre Culturel, Montb\u00e9liard * 1982 Salon de la Gravure, Montrouge * 1984 and 1994 Handmade Books ( Livres 'A Mano') at the Galerie Biren, Paris * 1990 6th Biennale de l'Estampe, Sarcelles * 1990 Poetry in a Garden ( La Po\u00e9sie dans un Jardin), a traveling exhibition shown in Nantes, N\u00eemes and Avignon * 1990 Texts and Images ( Textes et Images) at the National Library of Luxembourg * 2001 What Is an Artist's Book?
