    "text": "Adeela Suleman is a contemporary Pakistani sculptor and artist. She is currently the Coordinator of Vasl Artists\u2019 Collective in Karachi, and is also an Associate Professor (Bachelor of Fine Art Faculty) at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]http://www.indusvalley.edu.pk/web/undergraduate/bachelor-of-fine- art/ - She lives and works in Karachi, Pakistan, and is known for the social and political commentary underlying her sculptures, which are created out of mundane, everyday objects. == Early life & education == Adeela was born in Karachi, Pakistan in 1970. She first did an MA in International Relations from the University of Karachi in 1995, following which she switched her focus to art, completing her BFA in Sculpture from the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture in Karachi, Pakistan in 1999. == Career == Adeela Suleman's work takes found domestic objects and materials from everyday life and transforming them into sculptures. \"The everyday object, through its multiplication and assembly, becomes the delegate of a new, stimulating inner vision,\" she said. Her art has consistently reflected an engagement with contemporary socio- political concerns, primarily gender in Pakistani society, an engagement that has continued from her earlier university days. Her early work displayed the transformation of found objects into art. A theme running through her earlier work is the restrictions that women face in the private sphere. She created helmets, body armour and corsets made out of kitchen utensils and other functional tools, to show the entrapment that the private sphere imposes upon women in Pakistani society. Her more recent work has moved towards flatter silhouettes, creating tableaux on steel sheets, where pastoral scenes are rendered in the filigree tradition of Islamic art on the hard steel surface. These pastoral images are juxtaposed with symbols of destruction like weapons, the contradiction in these images signifying the indifference of society to the violence present within it. Suleman's work displays recurring motifs of organic elements like flowers and birds. === Exhibitions === Adeela Suleman's work has been exhibited both in group and solo exhibitions internationally.
