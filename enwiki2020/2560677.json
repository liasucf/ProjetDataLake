    "text": "The Batman comic strip began on October 25, 1943, a few years after the creation of the comic book Batman. At first titled Batman and Robin, a later incarnation was shortened to Batman. The comic strip had three major and two minor runs in American newspapers. ==Batman and Robin, 1943\u20131946== The first series was written by Bob Kane and others. It was published as both a daily strip and a Sunday strip. This series has been reprinted by DC Comics and Kitchen Sink Press in one Sunday and three daily volumes. It was distributed by the McClure Syndicate. The strip ended on November 2, 1946. From Joe Desris's introduction to the first book of daily reprints: \"... this newspaper strip, Batman and Robin, ... has important historical significance: It is the last large body of work that Batman creator Bob Kane penciled completely solo... and it contains stories by all of the significant writers from the first five, formative years of the feature\u2019s history: Don Cameron, Bill Finger, Jack Schiff and Alvin Schwartz.\u201dBatman: the Dailies 1943--1944, Kitchen Sink Press, DC Comics, 1990, ==Batman and Robin, 1953== The second series was written by Walter B. Gibson and was published on Sunday only, in September 1953. This short-lived attempt to revive the Batman comic strip ran only in Arrow, the Family Comic Weekly, which was edited by Gibson. A few of these very rare strips are reprinted in the book Batman: The Sunday Classics 1943\u201346. ==Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder, 1966\u20131973== Although it was credited to \"Bob Kane\", this series was actually ghostwritten, as noted below. The strip ran on Sunday from May 29, 1966 to July 13, 1969 and daily from May 30, 1966 to 1973. At first, this series was a camp revival drawing on the popularity of the Batman TV show as exemplified by the guest appearance of celebrities like Jack Benny and public figures like Conrad Hilton. Later, it told more serious Batman stories, and featured guest appearances by Batgirl, Superman and Aquaman. A 1970 sequence featuring Green Arrow and Man-Bat was reprinted in Amazing World of DC Comics #4-5 (1975). It was syndicated by the Ledger Syndicate. ===Episode guide=== {| class=\"wikitable\" | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Episode # | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Fan Title | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Writer | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Artist(s) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Start Date | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|End Date | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Inc.
