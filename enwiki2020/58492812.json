Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bulgarian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympics since 1924, except for three occasions: the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of Bulgaria\u2019s actions in World War II and the worldwide Great Depression and Soviet boycott, respectively. == Gymnastics == ===Artistic=== Bulgaria entered one artistic gymnast into the Olympic competition.
