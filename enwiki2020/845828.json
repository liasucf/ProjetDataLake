    "text": "The Rally of the Republicans (; abbreviated RDR) is a liberal party in Ivory Coast (). The party is the country's governing party; the party's leader, Alassane Ouattara, is the current President of Ivory Coast. ==History== The RDR, which has most of its support in the north of the country, was formed as a liberal offshoot of the ruling party, the Democratic Party of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (PDCI), in mid-1994. Dj\u00e9ni Kobina became the new party's Secretary-General. The RDR sought for Ouattara, who had served as Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993, to become its candidate in the 1995 presidential election. However, amendments to the electoral code required presidential candidates to have lived in the country for five years and to have been born of Ivorian parents. It was thought that these provisions were specifically intended to keep Ouattara out of the running; he had been deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund for almost five years and his father's family had roots in Burkina Faso. For this reason the RDR boycotted the election.Robert J. Mundt, \"C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: Continuity and Change in a Semi-Democracy\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. Clark and Gardinier, page 194\u2013197.

Ouattara said that he was eligible to stand in this election, scheduled to be held in 2000, pointing to documents which he said demonstrated that he and his parents were of Ivorian birth, as required by the electoral code. He was accused of forging these papers, however, and an investigation was begun.\"C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: Police arrest scores outside politician's home\", IRIN, September 15, 1999.\"Ivory Coast opposition leader under investigation\", BBC News, September 22, 1999.

When soldiers rebelled on December 23, 1999, one of their demands was the release of the imprisoned RDR leaders; when President Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 rejected the demands, they seized power on December 24 and promptly released the RDR prisoners.\"C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: Military coup announced\", IRIN, December 24, 1999. Ouattara returned to Ivory Coast on December 29, hailing B\u00e9di\u00e9's ouster as a \"revolution supported by all the Ivorian people\". Despite Ouattara's support for the coup, his candidacy in the October 2000 presidential election was rejected by the Supreme Court, on the same nationality basis that was used to prevent his candidacy during B\u00e9di\u00e9's presidency. As a result, the RDR decided to boycott the presidential election.\"C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: Former, current presidents address reconciliation forum\", IRIN, November 14, 2001.
