Gallery 30 has occupied two historic buildings in downtown Gettysburg, and its ownership has been active in the local community since the gallery's opening in 1979. Gallery 30 specializes in American fine art and artisan crafts with an emphasis on local and regional art; some of Gallery 30's most notable artists have included Wendy Allen, Janet Walsh and Metro the Painting Racehorse. ==History== Gallery 30 opened in October 1979 when watercolorist L. Chris Fick and former Gettysburg College professor Elizabeth \u201cBetty\u201d Martin partnered in a venture that they called a \u201chalf bookstore, half gallery.\u201d The women named their business \u201cGallery 30\u201d in honor of its location at 30 York Street in downtown Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Gallery 30 opened with a small selection of paintings, photographs and sculptures by local and regional artists and about 4,000 books. The book selection spanned many literary genres but focused primarily on children's literature, reflecting the owners\u2019 appreciation for the art of illustration. In June 1988, Gallery 30 was acquired by former music teacher and Kansas native Rodney Gisick. Although previous owner Betty Martin continued to be involved with Gallery 30's book department in an advisory capacity, Gisick took Gallery 30's selection in a different direction with the launch of a literary project that he dubbed \u201cMan to Man Books.\u201d By 1992 Gisick had compiled \u201cthe largest catalogue of men\u2019s studies books available\u201d in the United States, prompting one publisher to call Gallery 30 \u201cthe men\u2019s bookstore for the nation.\u201d During his time as owner, Gisick also made changes to Gallery 30's art department, adding handcrafted gold and sterling silver jewelry and more contemporary artisan crafts. In May 1993, Gallery 30 and its historic building were purchased by Washington, DC government relations consultants Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin. The new owners shifted Gallery 30's primary focus from books back to local and regional art and further diversified the gallery's collection of artisan crafts. Throughout the 1990s, Starkey and Gilmartin also concentrated on deepening the business's roots in the Gettysburg community by regularly hosting book signings, art contests and other family-friendly events. In August 2007, Gallery 30 and its historic building were acquired by Pennsylvania native Linda Atiyeh. Atiyeh enlarged Gallery 30's selection of Pennsylvania-made artisan crafts, added handcrafted jewelry by both local and international artists and refined Gallery 30's collection of local and regional fine art by placing a greater emphasis on Pennsylvania and Gettysburg-related subject matter. In 2013, Atiyeh expanded Gallery 30 by moving the business to a larger historic building at 26-28 York Street, next door to Gallery 30's original location.Haines, Jessica A. \u201cGallery 30 moves to new location in Gettysburg.\u201d The Gettysburg Times [Gettysburg, PA] 23 April 2013: page 1.

In April 2015, ===Historic architecture=== ====30 York Street==== The historic 19th Century building that originally housed Gallery 30 is located at 30 York Street, also known as US Route 30 and the historic Lincoln Highway, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The brick building bears an official plaque that verifies it as a Civil War building that was standing during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. In fact, the building was erected in the early 1800s by Gettysburg merchant John Hoke, the proprietor of a store offering dry goods and groceries. In 1858, J.C. Guinn took over Hoke's Store and continued to operate it \u201con an enlarged scale.\u201d In 1866, the store changed hands again when it was purchased by J.A. Grimes who called his business a \u201cfamily grocery and variety store.\u201d Nicholas Codori acquired the building in 1867 and started a butcher shop with his son Simon J. Codori. In 1906, the Codori family abandoned the butchering business in order to open a garage in another York Street building and form the Citizens Oil Company. By the early 1920s, Gettysburg merchant Harry Viener had acquired 30 York Street and was operating a store specializing in ready-made clothing. In 1953, Harry Viener's Store was sold to brothers Martin and Charles Redding and was reopened as Redding's Supply Store.\u201cRedding\u2019s opening will be held fri-sat.\u201d Redding's Supply Store remained in operation until 1979. In 1979, Chris Fick and Betty Martin acquired the 6,000-square-foot building at 30 York Street and renovations were undertaken in order to create a more light-filled space prior to Gallery 30's opening. Several 6-feet tall by 8-inches wide window panels were added to the east side of the brick building, and the interior was opened up to make way for a shiplap structure to be installed through the center of the space. Gettysburg contractor Robert Crouthamel was hired to construct a small house inside the building to serve as Gallery 30's children's book department. Gallery 30's logo and storefront sign were designed by architect Fred Harle of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; the logo consisted of a white numeral 30 oriented at a 30-degree angle on a green background. When Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin acquired 30 York Street in 1993, they made several architectural changes including enclosing the building's back porch in order to add windows and square footage to Gallery 30's retail gallery space. In 2007, Linda Atiyeh acquired 30 York Street. Atiyeh continued to operate Gallery 30 at its original location, making only minor architectural adjustments to the building's interior. ====26-28 York Street==== In 2012, Linda Atiyeh purchased the 16,400-square-foot building located at 26-28 York Street with plans to relocate and expand Gallery 30. This historic building began life as Walter's Theater; at the turn of the 20th Century entrepreneur John F. Walters, who had had great success with a small \u201cmoving picture business\u201d on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, decided \u201cto erect a larger theater, complete with stage on York Street.\u201d Walter's Theater regularly hosted picture shows, community theater events, singers and traveling vaudeville acts. The theater created a stir in 1910 when it featured a \u201creal burlesque show\u201d called \u201cMonte Carlo Girls\u201d live on its stage. The graduation ceremony for Gettysburg High School's class of 1917 was also held at Walter's Theater, with those in attendance taking special notice of the patriotic decorations hung throughout the auditorium in support of the American troops in World War I. In 1917, Richard H. Humphries of Philadelphia became the manager of Walter's Theater, changing the theater's name to the Lincoln Way Theater. In 1927, E.L. Weikert acquired the Lincoln Way Theater, remodeled the building into an auto garage and opened a Hudson-Essex dealership called E.L. Weikert Motor Car Company.Nasby, Dolly. Then & Now: Gettysburg. Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. Print. In 1931, Weikert sold the building to Luther Sachs, who opened Luther I. Sach's Hardware Store. Sach's partnered with the Adams County Market-Growers\u2019 Association in 1935 to create an indoor farmer's market in the rear section of his hardware store; thirty-three individual stalls were rented to local farmers at a rate of $25.00 per year. In the years that followed, 26\u201328 York Street was home to a number of different businesses, including H. G. Armistead Five and Ten Store, J. Louis Schultz Insurance and The Blind Center Shop. The Blind Center Shop was opened in 1949 by Cletus A. Wertz, a Gettysburg man who was blinded in an accident \u201cseveral years\u201d before. The shop carried leather and plastic products, including purses and belts, that were hand-laced and assembled by Wertz, who lived and worked with the assistance of his seeing-eye dog Dolly. In 1952, Hayward Wogan purchased 26-28 York Street. Wogan redesigned the building, christening it The Peoples Drug Store Building, and opened Peoples Drug Store, a Rexall pharmacy. In the mid-1980s, Hayward Wogan changed his pharmacy's name to Wogan's Drug Store. After Hayward Wogan's death, his sister Catherine Wogan closed the drug store and the space became Wogan's Antique Gallery. In 2012, Linda Atiyeh acquired the historic property and began extensive renovations, including removing a drop ceiling to uncover original skylights, un-bricking original windows, installing new electrical, heating/cooling and lighting systems, painting and restoring the exterior storefront, and uncovering and restoring the original wood floor using vintage floor planks reclaimed from a historic building in Kentucky. Gallery 30 opened for business in the newly restored building at 26-28 York Street in 2013.Haines, Jessica A. \u201cGallery 30 moves to new location in Gettysburg.\u201d The Gettysburg Times [Gettysburg, PA] 23 April 2013: page 1. Print ==Community involvement== Throughout its history, Gallery 30 has endeavored to give back to the local community in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Gallery 30's founders often held book signings, film screenings, slideshows, lectures and art exhibitions that were open to the community free of charge. Under the direction of owner Rod Gisick, Gallery 30 began hosting larger artistic events, including the Annual Loretta Chris Fick Memorial Art Show and Reception and the First Annual Pennsylvania Artisans Show. In 1993, owners Lois Starkey and Bill Gilmartin instituted a free children's story hour, occasionally featuring readings by local authors, held weekly at Gallery 30. Throughout the 1990s, Gallery 30 supported fledgling community organizations such as Main Street Gettysburg and Gettysburg Area Retail Merchants Association. Gallery 30's ownership was also instrumental in the formation of the Adams County Arts Council and the History Meets the Arts Exhibition, \u201ca multi-faceted cultural event held annually in Gettysburg to showcase our nation\u2019s prominent historical artists in an up-close, personal setting.\u201d Gallery 30 was involved in Downtown Gettysburg's inaugural First Friday event in 2002 and continues to celebrate First Friday to this day with extended hours, featured artists, book signings and refreshments on the first Friday of each month. ==Notable artists== Gallery 30 has exhibited American fine art and American craft for over 36 years.

Metro Meteor was \u201conce considered one of the fastest sprinters on the east coast, winning eight races and more than $300,000 at Belmont and Saratoga; that is until knee crippling injuries ended his racing career and almost ended his life.\u201d In 2009, Gettysburg artist Ron Krajewski adopted Metro off the track and first gave the horse a paintbrush. Metro started making broad strokes against a canvas, and soon the horse was painting with Krajewski every day. Half of Metro's profits from the sale of each painting are donated to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program, \u201can organization that retrains and finds new homes for retired racehorses.\u201d As of July 2015, Metro had raised over $80,000 for the charity. ==Gallery 30 news coverage== In 2013, Gallery 30 was featured in the New York Times article, \"36 Hours in Gettysburg.\u201dhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/travel/36-hours-in-gettysburg- pa.html?_r=0 New York Daily News also featured Gallery 30 in 2013 article, which noted Gallery 30's long history and emphasis on \u201chandmade in the USA.\u201d Gettysburg makes a great American destination\".
