    "text": "Green Europe (, EV) is a green and progressive electoral list in Italy. It was founded to took part to the 2019 European Parliament election in connection with the European Green Party and it was composed of the Federation of the Greens, Possible, Green Italy (whose leader is also a member of Possible) and Greens of South Tyrol. Currently the list is the electoral expression of the Federation of the Greens. == History == Initially the Federation of the Greens found an agreement with Italy in Common of Federico Pizzarotti to form a list for the 2019 European Parliament election; however, in March, Pizzarotti decided to abandon the alliance with the Greens to make an agreement with More Europe. Subsequently the Greens made an agreement with Possible of Beatrice Brignone, that submitted the alliance to an internal vote among its members. After that an article by Il Foglio reported that two candidates on the list (Giuliana Farinaro and Elvira Maria Vernengo) had received support from the Green Front (led by Vincenzo Galizia, former leader of the youth section of the Tricolour Flame), Giuseppe Civati withdrew (informally) his candidacy and suspended his election campaign. In the EP election the list received 2.29% of the votes, thus not exceeding the 4% threshold of the italian electoral law. Civati was the most voted candidate on the list with 12,247 preferences. == Composition == On the occasion of the 2019 European Parliament election the list was composed of the following parties: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%\" |- !colspan=2|Party !Main ideology !Leader |- |bgcolor=\"\"| |Federation of the Greens (FdV) |Green politics |Angelo Bonelli |- |bgcolor=\"\"| |Possible (Pos) |Progressivism |Beatrice Brignone |- |bgcolor=\"\"| |Greens of South Tyrol (Gr\u00fcne) |Green politics |Tobias Planer and Brigitte Foppa |- |bgcolor=\"#4CB640\"| |Green Italy (GI) |Green politics |Annalisa Corrado |} == Electoral results == === European Parliament === {|class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\" |- |colspan=6|European Parliament |- !width=13%|Election year !width=16%|Votes !width=6%|% !width=1%|Seats !width=8%|+/\u2013 !width=18%|Leader |- !2019 |621,492 (7th) |2.32 | |\u2013 |Giuseppe Civati |} === Regional Councils === {| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\" |- ! width=19%|Region ! width=13%|Election year ! width=16%|Votes ! width=7%|% ! width=1%|Seats ! width=6%|+/\u2212 |- !Liguria !2020 |9,193 (10th) |1.5 | |\u2013 |- !Emilia-Romagna !2020 |42,156 (8th) |2.0 | | 1 |- !Veneto !2020 |34,647 (9th) |1.7 | | 1 |- !Marche !2020 |17,268 (7th) |2.8 | | 1 |- !Umbria !2019 |5,975 (10th) |1.4 | |\u2013 |} == References == Category:2019 establishments in Italy Category:Left-wing political party alliances Category:Political party alliances in Italy Category:Political parties established in 2019 Category:United fronts Category:Federation of the Greens Category:Green political parties in Italy ",
