He also appeared on TV while at Primary school with fellow Mellor pupils on the children's show Umbrella, filmed at BBC Manchester. ==UK career== ===Early career=== Lowe's had a stint as a Take That backing singer during their 1995 UK tour. He was part of the male voice choir, named 'The Wanted Men', who sang behind the group in the encore, and specifically during the Number One hit single at that time \"Never Forget\". ===North and South=== He first rose to fame just out of school, as a member of the teenage boy band North and South, along with Lee Otter, James Hurst and Sam Chapman. Lowe played keyboard, saxophone, and sang vocals. The band starred in the BAFTA nominated hit BBC TV series No Sweat, for which Lowe composed the soundtrack at the age of eighteen. ===West End career=== Lowe starred in the London West End award-winning productions of Les Mis\u00e9rables and Cats in the leading roles of \"Marius\" and \"The Rum Tum Tugger\".

His ties to the emergent Chinese market are credited to numerous visits to China, many of them sponsored by the Chinese government. Lowe is the Harvard cultural attach\u00e9 to the Shaolin Temple, responsible for training such top Chinese film celebrities as Jet Li. His fellowship at Harvard enabled him to spend four months traveling the ancient Silk Road through Xinjiang and Gansu provinces in northwest and central China, as an editor for the best selling student travel guide Let's Go. His esteemed Harvard thesis on Tang Dynasty frontier poetry won him an honors degree and was contributed to the Harvard Yenching Library following Magna Cum Laude recognition. These cultural advantages, coupled with his first hand, viable experience in the world of pop music and Broadway musicals, has afforded him a unique expertise, for a Westerner, in the commercial Chinese entertainment scene.

During Hollywood Week's group round, Lowe sang \"How Deep Is Your Love\" together with Blake Lewis, Rudy Cardenas and Chris Sligh, to move forward to the top tier of contestants. His encounter with 'Idol' and X Factor has proved to be a source for 'Runner-Up', a new Broadway musical he is co-writing, centered on a fictitious reality show. His rendition of \"God Bless America\" at The LA Dodgers stadium was broadcast on television to an audience of millions. ===Musical theatre=== Lowe performed in a major production of Les Mis\u00e9rables at the Hollywood Bowl, on 8\u201310 August 2008, this time playing the rebel hero role of Enjolras.
