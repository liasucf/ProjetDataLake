    "text": "The Torriani Award is given annually by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) to an ice hockey player with an \"outstanding career from non-top hockey nation\". It was inaugurated in 2015, and is awarded alongside the annual IIHF Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the Ice Hockey World Championships. It is named for Bibi Torriani, who played internationally for the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team. When the award was first announced, IIHF president Ren\u00e9 Fasel was quoted as saying; \"we wanted to create a trophy which honours players for a great international career irrespective of where they played. Nowadays, with NHL players and international players often being the same, we feel that there are so many top players to honour. Still, we wanted to ensure we recognized players who didn\u2019t necessarily win Olympic and World Championship medals but who still had remarkable careers. As a result, we created the Torriani Award, and Lucio Topatigh is a very worthy first recipient\". ==Recipients== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name!!Country!!Year |- | | |2015 |- | | |2016 |- | | |2017 |- | | |2018 |- | | |2019 |- | | |2020 |} ==See also== *Paul Loicq Award ==References== Category:Ice hockey-related lists Category:Ice hockey trophies and awards Category:International Ice Hockey Federation Category:Awards established in 2015 ",
