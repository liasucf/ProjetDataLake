    "text": "The Night Before is a 1988 American comedy film starring Keanu Reeves and Lori Loughlin. Reeves plays Winston Connelly, the so-called high school nerd and vice president of the astronomy club. Loughlin plays Tara Mitchell, the pretty and popular head cheerleader who also happens to be the local police chief's daughter. The Tagline was: \"You lost your father's car, sold your prom date and a guy called 'Tito' wants you dead. It's a date that's the time of your life.\" It was filmed and set entirely in Los Angeles, California. == Plot summary == The storyline is told through a series of flashbacks. The movie opens with Winston regaining consciousness in an alley in the middle of the night with no idea of how he got there. Through a series of flashbacks, he remembers that he was waylaid on his way to the prom the night before. In the meantime, he has to figure out what happened to his wallet, his car keys, his prom date, and why a pimp named \"Tito\" wants him dead. After losing a bet on a football game, Tara has to go to prom with the flattered but clueless nerd Winston. In the hijinks that follow, Winston manages to get them lost in the ghetto, befriend a hooker named Rhonda (Theresa Saldana), and accidentally sell Tara to a diminutive pimp named Tito (Trinidad Silva). Winston spends the remainder of the evening searching for Tara in the seedy underworld of Los Angeles whilst seeking to avoid Tito's wrath after Tito discovers the identity of Tara's father. In the end, Winston gets the girl, escapes from the pimp and even recovers his dad's car from a car thief named \"Danny Boy\". An abbreviated version of the Funk-Rock collective, Parliament-Funkadelic appears in the movie under the name the Rat's Nest Band. == Cast == * Keanu Reeves as Winston Connelly * Lori Loughlin as Tara Mitchell * Theresa Saldana as Rhonda * Trinidad Silva as Tito * Suzanne Snyder as Lisa == External links== * * * Category:1980s teen comedy films Category:1988 films Category:American teen comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films directed by Thom Eberhardt Category:1988 comedy films ",
