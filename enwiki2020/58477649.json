    "text": "A pump-action rifle is a rifle where the forend can be moved forward and backward in order to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a new one. Pump-action mechanisms are often regarded as faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require the trigger hand to be removed from the trigger while reloading. Most pump-actions do however have a firing mechanism using a hammer, which leads to a longer lock time than the hammer-less mechanisms found on most bolt rifles. Furthermore, pump-actions often have little or no mechanical leverage in order to aid in chambering and primary extraction, as opposed to a traditional turn-bolt action . {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !class=\"unsortable\"| Image !Cartridge(s) !Years produced !Country of origin |- |Colt Lightning Carbine |250px |Various |1884-1904 | |- |Winchester Model 1890 |250px |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, .22 Winchester Rimfire |1890-1941 | |- |Winchester Model 1906 | |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle |1906-1932 | |- |Remington Model 14 | |.25 Remington, .30 Remington, .32 Remington, .35 Remington, .38-40 Winchester, .44-40 Winchester |1913\u20131934 (Model 14) 1914\u20131931 (Model 14-1/2) 1935\u20131950 (Model 141) | |- |FN Trombone | |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle |1922-1974 | |- |Remington Model 121 Fieldmaster | |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 LR |1936-1954 | |- |Remington Model 760 |250px |Various, from 6mm Remington to .30-06 Springfield |1952-1981 | |- |SIG 550 VRBSIG\u2019s Pump Action 550 Rifle: the 550 VRB \u2013 Forgotten Weapons | |.222 Rem, .223 Rem | | |- |Remington Model 572 | |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 LR |1954-current | |- |Remington Model 572 Fieldmaster | |.22 Short, .22 Long, .22 LR |1956-current | |- |Izhmash MBO-3 | |5.6\u00d739mm |1960sMBO-3 Temp: The unknown sport rifle | |- |Remington Model 7600 |250px |Various, from 6mm Remington to .30-06 Springfield |1981-current | |- |IMI Timber Wolf | |.38 Special / .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum |1989-? | |- |Crossfire MKICROSSFIRE!
