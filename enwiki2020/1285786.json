    "text": "Tami Stronach (born 1972) is an actor, dancer, and professor. ==Personal life== Tami Stronach was born in summer 1972 in Iran. Her parents were the archaeologists David Stronach from Scotland (1931\u20132020) and Ruth Stronach from Israel (; 1937\u20132017). After fleeing the Iranian Revolution, Stronach, her sister Keren, and their parents moved to California in 1981 to allow David to teach at the University of California, Berkeley. By late 2014, Stronach and her three-year-old daughter Maya lived in Brooklyn; Stronach was married to Greg Steinbruner as of mid-2020. ==Career== In addition to her artistic projects, Stronach also followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a professor in New York City. ===Acting=== While Stronach was a child actor portraying Piglet in a San Francisco stage adaptation of Winnie-the-Pooh, she was approached by the casting director for The NeverEnding Story and asked to audition for the role of the Childlike Empress. After three auditions, Stronach beat Heather O'Rourke to star in the 1984 film; it has been her only major motion picture. Ruth Stronach declined a sequel contract for her daughter, worried about lacking the werewithal to \"help her daughter navigate the turbulent waters of childhood stardom in the film industry.\" After NeverEnding Story became a sensational success, the Stronachs were besieged with unwanted attention: their home and telephone were stalked, adults proposed to the eleven-year-old with engagement rings, and she received \"offers from Hollywood to play roles featuring scenes (with nudity) completely inappropriate for someone her age.\" Stronach returned to acting in 2002 with a physical theatre company, and by 2006 had performed in Chambre at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and was continuing to study acting with Laura Esterman. By the 2010s, Stronach had co-founded a theatre company called Shoehorn Theater; in 2012, they began creating a new play, Light: A Dark Comedy (\"a group generative effort where everyone is involved in every step of the creation.\") In July 2020, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Stronach had been cast to star in Man & Witch alongside Sean Astin, Rhea Perlman, Christopher Lloyd, and Michael Emerson. ===Dancing=== Switching her focus from acting to professional dancing after The NeverEnding Story, Stronach devoted herself to that study for ten years (through her twenties) in New York City. In 1996, Stronach began dancing with Neta Pulvermacher and Dancers, though she has also exhibited her own productions at Dixon Place, Washington Square Park, and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. ===Performance credits=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Medium ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! class=\"unsortable\" | Role ! class=\"unsortable\" | Citation(s) |- | | Theatre ! scope=\"row\" | Winnie-the-Pooh | Piglet | |- | | Film ! scope=\"row\" | '''' | Childlike Empress | |- | | Theatre ! scope=\"row\" | Signals of Distress | Dog | |} ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * * Category:1972 births Category:20th-century actresses Category:21st-century actresses Category:female dancers Category:film child actresses Category:living people Category:people of Israeli descent Category:people of Scottish descent Category:stage actresses ",
