The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \"B\" grade and wrote, \"Episodes like 'The Good Soldier' fall into my least favorite type of case structure on Grimm: episodic crime plots that don't reveal or advance anything about the central characters. Last week's episode spotlighted Hank and showed him getting back in the game while working on a case. But this week's plot didn't involve the Airstream until the final 10 minutes, instead featuring a didactic missive against military contractors given immunity from prosecution in American war zones. However, rarely has an episode of Grimm culminated in such an outright cool fight sequence that didn't involve the main characters. So as far as episodes like this go, 'The Good Soldier' is probably my favorite.\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.7 star rating out of 5, stating: \"Manticores, looking like something I would fight against in a Final Fantasy game, came to Portland seeking vengeance in Grimm Season 3 Episode 11. The case with the manticores was pretty average. There's really not much to talk about.\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \"'The Good Soldier' was a bit of a downer for everyone. Rosalee was ultimately forgiven by her family and welcomed back. Monroe got the 'hurt her and we'll kill you speech' (it's a classic) and surprisingly, the Blutbad prejudice was kept to a minimum. Their journey was traumatic like early-to-mid-'90s sisterhood movies: affirming in the end, but emotionally wringing. I'm looking at you, Boys on the Side.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Grimm (season 3) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ",
