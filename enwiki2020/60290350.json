    "text": "The 1920\u201321 season was the 20th season of competitive football played by Cardiff City and the team's first in the Football League. The club had finished fourth in the First Division of the Southern Football League the previous season, but the league had since been absorbed into the Football League. After a successful voting ballot by other members of the league, Cardiff were placed into the Football League Second Division. Cardiff finished the season tied on points with league winners Birmingham, with 58 of a possible 84 points. The winner was therefore decided via goal average, with Cardiff placing second. The two sides were both promoted to the First Division. Cardiff also reached the semifinal of the FA Cup, becoming the first Welsh side to do so and keeping seven consecutive clean sheets in the process. They were eliminated from the competition by fellow Second Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers 3\u20131 in a replay at Old Trafford. In the Welsh Cup, Cardiff were the holders entering the competition but were eliminated in the third round by Pontypridd after a fixture clash forced them to field a reserve side in the competition. During the season, 29 players were used in all competitions. Billy Hardy featured in more games than any other player, being ever present in both the league and FA Cup with 49 appearances. He missed only one senior match for the side, the club's Welsh Cup defeat. Forward Jimmy Gill, signed at the start of the season, was the club's top goalscorer. He scored 20 goals in all competitions, finishing the campaign eight goals clear of the next highest scoring player, Arthur Cashmore. The club attracted an average attendance of over 28,000 for its first season in the Football League, rising from previous years in the Southern League. Home matches against Coventry City and Bristol City both recorded season-high attendances of 42,000. The lowest attendances recorded were 20,000 for matches against Leicester City and Barnsley. ==Background and preseason== Cardiff City had spent the previous decade playing in the Southern Football League. The team had entered the competition in 1910 after becoming a professional football club. In the 1919\u201320 season they finished fourth in the First Division of the Southern Football League. The Football League, a rival competition to the Southern League at the time, was looking to expand and ultimately absorbed the Southern League's First Division to form a new Football League Third Division. The Southern League had suffered several blows in the years prior with London- based sides Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Fulham all moving into the Football League. Cardiff's founder Walter Bartley Wilson, along with the club's committee, set about preparing an application to become one of two sides that would enter the Football League Second Division in place of the two teams that finished at the bottom of the division in the previous season. Votes were cast on the decision by members of the Football League with Leeds United, looking to replace Leeds City who had dropped out of the Football League after eight matches the previous year, receiving 31 votes. Cardiff came second with 23 votes, beating out their nearest rival, relegated side Grimsby Town by three votes. Lincoln City received only seven votes and Rochdale and Chesterfield withdrew their applications prior to the voting. Cardiff's election meant that they were placed in a higher division than the three sides, Portsmouth, Watford and Crystal Palace, that had finished above them the previous year. The decision proved controversial, particularly at Portsmouth who had finished as Champions. The Southern Football League also fined Cardiff \u00a3500 for providing insufficient notice of their departure from the competition. For Cardiff, manager Fred Stewart, appointed in 1913, remained in charge. Stewart maintained the core of his side from the previous season. The most notable signing made prior to the start of the new campaign being forward Jimmy Gill, who was signed from The Wednesday for \u00a3750 (around \u00a346,000 in the modern day). Other new signings included Herbie Evans from local side Cardiff Corinthians, goalkeeper Ben Davies from Middlesbrough, Ernie Gault from Everton and Laurence Abrams from Chelsea. Stewart also decided to allow Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey to leave the club. The decision proved surprising to many given the two players' experience. The pair, alongside Billy Hardy, had formed part of the \"holy three\", as they were known by fans in the Southern League, but the emergence of Fred Keenor hastened their departure. ==Football League Second Division== Jimmy Gill scored twice in Cardiff's first game of the season and finished the campaign as the club's top scorer. Cardiff were handed an away fixture in their first match in the Football League, facing Stewart's former club Stockport County. Considered underdogs against the more experienced side, Cardiff secured a 5\u20132 victory with two goals from new signing Gill and one each from Jack Evans, Billy Grimshaw and Keenor. The performance led The Times to describe the victory as \"one of the best performances of the day\" in the Football League. The team's second match was the first Football League match held at Ninian Park as 25,000 fans witnessed a goalless draw with Clapton Orient. The first home victory at the ground came in the team's following match when they recorded a 3\u20130 victory over Stockport in the reverse fixture. The previous season's top goalscorer Arthur Cashmore opened the scoring, becoming the first player to score a Football League goal at Ninian Park, before Grimshaw added a brace. Cardiff suffered its first defeat in the Football League in the reverse fixture against Clapton Orient on 6 September, losing 2\u20130. The side recovered to claim a win and a draw in back-to-back fixtures against Birmingham in their following two matches, Gill scoring in both games. Another set of back-to-back fixtures followed against West Ham United with the two sides having identical records before the matches. In keeping with prior form, the two sides drew both matches. The first match at Ninian Park ended 0\u20130, the second resulted in a 1\u20131 draw with Gill maintaining his early season form by scoring his fifth goal of the campaign. Cardiff remained unbeaten throughout the rest of October, recording consecutive 3\u20130 victories over Fulham and a win and a draw against Notts County. After victory in the first fixture against Notts County, a match they were widely expected to struggle in, Cardiff led the division after 11 matches. However, the subsequent draw, followed by a loss against Leicester City on 6 November allowed South Shields to overtake them. The return fixture against Leicester was won 2\u20130 following goals from Cashmore and Gill, in front of a joint season-low crowd of 20,000. Soon after, Cardiff secured a 4\u20132 victory over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road. Prior to the victory, Cardiff broke their record transfer fee to sign Scottish international fullback Jimmy Blair from The Wednesday for \u00a33,500, also a record fee for a full back at the time. Blair made his debut for the club in the match, replacing Albert Barnett, and remained first choice throughout the remainder of the season. After a 0\u20130 draw at home against Blackpool, Blair returned to face his former club Wednesday and helped his new side record consecutive 1\u20130 victories, both matches being decided by goals from George West. Their form prompted The Times to report that the side were playing with \"great determination\" to win promotion to the First Division. The victories returned Cardiff to the top of the table and their position was further strengthened by a 2\u20131 victory over Bury, despite rivals Birmingham recording their tenth consecutive victory. Cardiff defeated Coventry City 4\u20132 on Christmas Day in a match that recorded a joint season-high attendance of 42,000 and left the side leading the division having lost only two matches in the first half of the campaign. However, a 1\u20130 defeat in the return fixture two days later allowed Bristol City to move into first place on goal average and Birmingham to move within one point of the pair at the end of the calendar year. Cardiff endured a disappointing start to 1921, losing 1\u20130 to Bury on New Year's Day before drawing 0\u20130 with promotion rivals Bristol City on 15 January. With Cardiff and Bristol drawing, Birmingham overtook the pair to go top. Cardiff faced Bristol City again in their next fixture with goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw missing his first match of the season after suffering a cheek injury. His replacement, Ben Davies, would go on to feature in all of the club's remaining fixtures. The side recorded a 1\u20130 victory over their Severnside rivals with Barnett scoring the only goal with an attendance of around 42,000, the joint largest home crowd of the season at Ninian Park. However, a defeat to Stoke on 5 February saw Cardiff lose ground on their promotion rivals and drop to third place. A 2\u20130 win over Barnsley, with goals from Gill and debutant Harry Nash, and a goalless draw with Stoke were not enough to stop the side slipping to fourth place soon after. In the team's last fixture in February, Cardiff defeated Nottingham Forest 2\u20131, leaving Cardiff, Bristol City and Blackpool tied for second place on 38 points. Concerned about the lack of goals being scored by his side, Stewart, who had already signed Nash in an attempt to remedy the problem, made another new signing in March when forward Fred Pagnam arrived from First Division side Arsenal for a fee of \u00a33,000. Pagnam made a goalscoring debut as Cardiff defeated Barnsley 3\u20132. However, Cardiff suffered consecutive defeats for the first time during the campaign after losing 2\u20130 against Rotherham County and 2\u20131 against Port Vale. The defeats resulted in Cardiff falling five points behind leaders Birmingham, although their prolonged FA Cup run had left them with three games in hand. Two days after losing to Vale, Pagnam helped the side return to winning ways by scoring the only goal in a win over Leeds United on 28 March, although the match was marred by a broken leg suffered by Barnett that ended his season. In order to make up their games in hand, Cardiff played the return fixture against Leeds the following day as Pagnam again scored, this time alongside Keenor in a 2\u20131 victory. These victories were the start of a strong run of form as Cardiff won six of their following seven matches: having defeated Leeds, Cardiff drew 0\u20130 with Port Vale. They proceeded to win four consecutive matches, defeating Nottingham Forest 3\u20130 and recording 1\u20130 wins over South Shields (twice) and Rotherham. The side's form had brought them back into contention for the league title and, despite picking up only one point from two matches against Hull City at the end of April, Cardiff went into the final two league fixtures tied on points with league leaders Birmingham, who led on goal average. Bristol City were four points behind the pair meaning each side needed a point from their remaining two fixtures to guarantee promotion to the First Division. Cardiff faced back-to-back matches against Wolverhampton Wanderers, the side that had eliminated Cardiff from the semi-finals of the FA Cup two months earlier, to finish the season. In the first fixture, held at Ninian Park, 40,000 spectators witnessed Cardiff seal promotion with a 2\u20130 win, Gill and Pagnam the scorers. Cardiff's promotion had already been guaranteed by a draw between The Wednesday and Bristol City earlier in the day and the club's directors let in much of the capacity crowd for free in celebration. Gill and Pagnam were on the scoresheet again, along with Nash, to record a 3\u20131 win in the reverse match on 7 May. Despite winning both fixtures, Cardiff ultimately finished second to Birmingham on goal average. Birmingham's superior scoring record in home fixtures ultimately proved decisive with the champions scoring more than 20 goals more than Cardiff in those matches. Keenor later described the confusion at the end of the final match as the team waited for news on which side had won the league, commenting \"we waited anxiously in the dressing room for the result of the Birmingham match. It seemed hours before the result came through [...] this went on for 15 minutes, when a reporter walked in with the information that Birmingham were champions.\" ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 28 August 1920 ! scope=row| Stockport County (A) | align=center | 5\u20132 | J.

The match was played at Roker Park with a crowd of 41,923 on 8 January 1921 with Cardiff causing an upset by winning 1\u20130 following a goal from George Beare. In a reversal of fortune in the following round, Cardiff were seen as favourites after being drawn against Third Division side Brighton & Hove Albion. However, Cardiff was unable to make their higher ranking count as they were held to a goalless draw at Brighton's Goldstone Ground. In the replay, a single goal from Cashmore was enough to see Cardiff through to the third round. A third consecutive away draw followed, with Cardiff defeating Third Division Southampton 1\u20130 at The Dell after a goal from Gill. The club's victory over Southampton meant that, for the first time in their history, Cardiff had reached the fourth round of the FA Cup. The team were drawn against First Division side Chelsea who would be playing their eighth match in the competition having been taken to two replays by both Reading and Plymouth Argyle in the first and third rounds respectively. Chelsea's difficulty in overcoming opponents in the previous rounds meant that the match was seen as a closer contest than the divisional gap suggested. A crowd of 50,000 attended the match at Stamford Bridge as Cardiff took an early lead through Cashmore's second goal in the competition. Cardiff proceeded to defend resolutely throughout the remainder of the match as their defensive line of Blair, Charlie Brittain and Keenor received significant praise in match reports, and held their lead for the remainder of the game. Cardiff's victory over Chelsea saw them become the first Welsh side ever to reach the semi-final stage in the competition's history. The draw for the semi-final saw Cardiff paired with fellow Second Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers. As semi-final ties are traditionally held at a neutral venue, the match was moved to Anfield, the home ground of Liverpool, on 19 March. The match also became notable as the first football game ever attended by King George V and Queen Mary. Their only daughter, Princess Mary, was also present at the match. The game was described as a defensive affair with \"less than half-a-dozen\" shots taken throughout the game and ended in a goalless draw necessitating a replay. This was blamed largely on the heavy rain that fell throughout the day resulting in the pitch becoming greasy before badly cutting up as the game wore on. Wolves were adjudged to have been the stronger of the two sides with Evans being named as Cardiff's most impressive attacking player, although the side's defence was praised after recording their seventh consecutive clean sheet in the competition. 42,000 fans attended the fixture resulting in \u00a33,500 of receipts in one of the highest gates the club drew during the season. The reply was held at Old Trafford, the home ground of Manchester United, four days later. Cardiff's defence had not conceded a goal in the competition to this point but was breached after just 12 minutes and Wolves added a second goal before half- time. Cardiff pulled one goal back when they were awarded a penalty for handball which was converted by Keenor and this led to a brief upsurge in performance as the side looked for an equaliser. However, a number of long shots were defended by Wolves who added a third goal soon after as the match finished 3\u20131. 45,000 spectators had attended the replay yielding gate receipts of \u00a34,270. Wolves went on to lose the final 2\u20131 against First Division side Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge. ====Match results==== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *N = Neutral venue *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Round ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 8 January 1921 | First ! scope=row| Sunderland (A) | align=center | 1\u20130 | Beare | align=center | 41,923 |- | 29 January 1921 | Second ! scope=row| Brighton & Hove Albion (A) | align=center | 0\u20130 | | align=center | 20,269 |- | 2 February 1921 | Second (replay) ! scope=row| Brighton & Hove Albion (H) | align=center | 1\u20130 | Cashmore | align=center | 31,000 |- | 19 February 1921 | Third ! scope=row| Southampton (A) | align=center | 1\u20130 | Gill | align=center | 21,363 |- | 5 March 1921 | Fourth ! scope=row| Chelsea (H) | align=center | 1\u20130 | Cashmore | align=center | 50,000 |- | 19 March 1921 | Semi-final ! scope=row| Wolverhampton Wanderers (N) | align=center | 0\u20130 | | align=center | 42,000 |- | 23 March 1921 | Semi-final (reply) ! scope=row| Wolverhampton Wanderers (N) | align=center | 1\u20133 | Keenor (p) | align=center | 45,000 |} ===Welsh Cup=== Cardiff entered the competition as reigning holders having won the trophy for the second time in their history in April 1920 after defeating Wrexham 2\u20130. The side's first match was in the third round where they were drawn against Pontypridd. The match however was scheduled for 15 January 1921, the same day as Cardiff were due to play Bristol City in the Second Division. Both matches went ahead on the same date with the first team playing in the league and a team made up of reserve and fringe players travelling to Pontypridd. The weakened side suffered a 2\u20131 defeat with Cardiff's goal being scored by Len Davies. ====Match results==== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Round ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 15 January 1921 | Third ! scope=row| Pontypridd (A) | align=center | 1\u20132 | L.

Billy Hardy made the most appearances of any player, featuring in all 42 league and 7 FA Cup matches. Bert Smith, Fred Keenor, Jimmy Gill and Charlie Brittain were the only other players to play 40 or more matches during the season. The Welsh Cup fixture clash provided Len Hopkins, Tommy Sayles and Tommy Wilmott with their only appearances of the season. Gill was the club's top scorer during the season, scoring nineteen in the Second Division and one in the FA Cup. Arthur Cashmore, the previous season's top scorer, was the only other player to reach double figures, scoring twelve in all competitions. Despite joining the club with only three months of the season remaining, Fred Pagnam was the third highest scorer having scored eight goals in fourteen appearances. In total, eleven players scored at least one goal during the campaign. Len Davies' goal against Pontypridd in the Welsh Cup was the first goal of his senior career. He would go on to become Cardiff's all-time leading goalscorer with 128 in all competitions. ===Player statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !rowspan=2 style=\"width:20em\"scope=col|Player !rowspan=2|Position !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|Second Division !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|FA Cup !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|Welsh Cup !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|Total |- !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals |- ! scope=row|Laurence Abrams |HB |1||0||0||0||1||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Albert Barnett |DF |16||0||5||0||0||0||21||0 |- ! scope=row|George Beare |FW |23||3||7||1||0||0||30||4 |- ! scope=row|Jimmy Blair |DF |25||0||7||0||0||0||32||0 |- ! scope=row|Charlie Brittain |DF |35||0||7||0||0||0||42||0 |- ! scope=row|Arthur Cashmore |FW |26||10||7||2||0||0||33||12 |- ! scope=row|Joe Clark |FW |13||0||1||0||1||0||15||0 |- ! scope=row|Ben Davies |GK |19||0||6||0||1||0||26||0 |- ! scope=row|Len Davies |FW |3||0||0||0||1||1||4||1 |- ! scope=row|Herbie Evans |HB |5||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- ! scope=row|Jack Evans |FW |29||1||6||0||0||0||35||1 |- ! scope=row|Sidney Evans |FW |4||1||0||0||1||0||5||1 |- ! scope=row|Ernie Gault |FW |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Jimmy Gill |FW |37||19||6||1||0||0||43||20 |- ! scope=row|Billy Grimshaw |FW |15||4||2||0||0||0||17||4 |- ! scope=row|Billy Hardy |HB |42||1||7||0||0||0||49||1 |- ! scope=row|Len Hopkins |HB |0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Charlie Jones |FW |1||0||0||0||1||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Fred Keenor |DF |38||4||7||1||0||0||45||5 |- ! scope=row|Herbert Kneeshaw |GK |23||0||1||0||0||0||24||0 |- ! scope=row|Edward Layton |DF |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Harry Nash |FW |14||2||0||0||0||0||14||2 |- ! scope=row|Billy Newton |HB |5||0||0||0||1||0||6||0 |- ! scope=row|Jack Page |DF |9||0||0||0||1||0||10||0 |- ! scope=row|Fred Pagnam |FW |14||8||0||0||0||0||14||8 |- ! scope=row|Tommy Sayles |FW |0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Bert Smith |DF |40||0||7||0||0||0||47||0 |- ! scope=row|George West |FW |21||4||1||0||0||0||22||4 |- ! scope=row|Tommy Wilmott |DF |0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0 |- |} FW = Forward, HB = Halfback, GK = Goalkeeper, DF = Defender Sources: ==Aftermath== By winning promotion, Cardiff became the first Welsh side to reach the top tier of the Football League. They also became only the second side to win promotion to the First Division in their first season in the Football League, equalling the feat of Tottenham Hotspur in 1909. The majority of the squad would remain to form the core of the first team in the following seasons. Some players were displaced by new signings and departed within the first half of the 1921\u201322 season, including Cashmore, Beare and West. Pagnam would also depart during the following season as he was unable to reproduce his good form in the higher tier, failing to score in 13 appearances. A major increase in attendances following the move into the Football League and a long cup run significantly benefited the club financially with the accounts being described as in \"rude health\". The club received praise for their performances through the campaign with the South Wales Echo writing \"In all parts of the country Cardiff City is described as the team of the year and surely no other club has a better right to be so designated. Some of their performances have been really brilliant.\" ==References== Specific Bibliography * * * * * Category:Cardiff City F.C. seasons Cardiff ",
