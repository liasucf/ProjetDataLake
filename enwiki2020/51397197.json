Heeney. ==Content== The song is an up-tempo about a man who expresses desire for a woman named Becky Jo who works at the song's eponymous store. ==Critical reception== Deborah Evans Price of Billboard reviewed the song favorably, saying that \"the clever lyric serves up a picturesque look at an all-purpose rural retail outlet and the pretty employee that keeps a lovesick Romeo frequenting the establishment. The vocal is full of energy, and Rogers' production is taut\". ==Chart performance== Due to the length of the song's title, it was listed as just \"Dixie Rose Deluxe's\" on the charts. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2004) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2004 singles Category:2004 songs Category:Trent Willmon songs Category:Songs written by Michael P.
