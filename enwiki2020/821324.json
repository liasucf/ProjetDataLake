    "text": "xMule \u2014 the X11 Mule \u2014 is a client for the eDonkey peer-to-peer file sharing network, originally intended to bring it to virtually all the major Unix platforms, with a particular emphasis on Linux. The project is no longer being developed, and users of xMule are encouraged to move to the BitTorrent network or use aMule in the official xMule website. xMule has since suffered from negative publicity through anonymous comments on software review sites such as GnomeFiles and Zeropaid, some of them even suggesting that the xMule project had stopped (while promoting aMule) when it was not the case at the time. The official aMule page solely states that \"relations between the two projects are sadly in a rather sorry state\", whereas xMule's site contains an extensive manifesto on the issue, which goes as far as drawing comparisons to the different coding philosophies behind Internet Explorer and Mozilla. ==Trivia== The name xMule was created as the new official name for the lMule project when it was first ported to FreeBSD in early May 2003 and the maintainers effectively lost control of the lMule website. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Free file sharing software Category:EDonkey Clients for Linux Category:File sharing software that uses wxWidgets Category:X Window programs Category:Discontinued software Category:Software forks Category:2003 software ",
