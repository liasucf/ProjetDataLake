They are shrubs or small trees, with mostly simple leaves, and entire margins. They flower profusely in mid- winter. Each flower bears numerous white filaments and a purple style, but no petals. The round fruit appear from August to October. These are yellow when ripe and 1 cm in diameter. It is a food plant for some species of Colotis butterfly. ==References== racemulosa Category:Trees of Africa Category:Flora of Southern Africa ",
