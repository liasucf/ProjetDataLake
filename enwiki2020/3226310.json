Surrounding the station is a small commercial area with a few shops, supermarkets, izakayas and restaurants. It is close to several of Tokyo's universities, including Ochanomizu University and University of Tsukuba. It is also close to the Koishikawa Botanical Garden, which is affiliated with the University of Tokyo. The residential area just to the north of Kasuga-dori Avenue, on which the station is situated, is laden with parks and green belts, which is rare for such a central neighborhood. Tokyo's printing district is another point of interest in the area. Just south of the Koishikawa Botanical Garden is a neighborhood full of many tiny scale printing shops that are simply houses converted into printing enterprises, many of them situated on narrow streets which sometimes become congested with forklifts and trucks delivering paper and printed material. ==See also== * List of railway stations in Japan ==References== ==External links== * Category:Railway stations in Tokyo Category:Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1954 ",
