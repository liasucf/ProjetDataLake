Since in was established in 2006, Public Movement has worked on a variety of performative actions such as events, rituals, ceremonies, and political actions. The group performs focused-actions that explore the issues, ideas and dynamics of public spaces. Many of their works are created in collaboration with scholars and experts in fields outside of the arts. In many cases, these collaborations have furthered debate and discussion about contemporary issues surrounding Public Movement's actions. Public Movement was co-founded in 2006 by Omer Kreiger and Dana Yahalomi. In 2011, Yahalomi assumed sole leadership of the group. == Significant actions == === Spring in Warsaw (2009) === Spring in Warsaw was an urban walk along a route in a rare site of civil pilgrimage. Public Movement members, together with Polish collaborators, led a walk in the Warsaw Ghetto, in the footsteps of Israeli and Jewish youth delegations which visit the city every spring. The Public was gathered in the Umschlagplatz at 18:00, marched and participated in rituals along a route which included the Ghetto Uprising command bunker on 18 Mila Street, The house in which Ludwik Zamenhof who invented Esperanto had lived, and the Memorial of German Chancellor Willy Brandt's 1970 kneeling. The closing ceremony took place at Nathan Rapoport's Monument to the Ghetto Heroes, with the laying of a Public Movement wreath, a speech and a dance for the Rapoport memorial. === University Exercise (2010) === University Exercise was an organized occupied led by Public Movement of Heidelberg University main building and University Square.

Public Movement negotiated with a variety of different figures and organizations for SALONS: Birthright Palestine?. In preparation for the action, Public Movement Agents gather extensive research, much of which ended up in the cutting room in moments where the information is \"volatile, sensitive or the quantity is too unwieldy to translate into physical movements, the material remains in the background.\" Debriefing Session shares the \u201ctransitional moment between research and action,\u201d inviting the listeners to understand themselves as stakeholders in the greater action and \u201cturning members of the public into future agents.\u201d The project was created by Alhena Katsof and Dana Yahalomi. This performative action was also the subject of a book, \u201cSolution 263: Double Agent,\u201d which was published by Sternberg Press in 2015. Debriefing Session was altered and performed many subsequent times, including at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for Debriefing Session II. ===SALONS: Birthright Palestine? (2012) === SALONS: Birthright Palestine? was a performative event that consisted of five different sessions, or \u201cSALONS.\u201d Each SALON was modeled after a different type of public debate setting and was hosted in multiple different venues. The public debates were modeled after \u201ccongressional sessions, summit meetings, visioning sessions, diplomatic consultations, secret gatherings, and demonstrations.\u201d The five different SALONS all focused on the phenomenon of Birthright Israel and pushed viewers to question the ideas of diaspora, nationhood, and the right to return. These events were performed as a part of the New Museum\u2019s 2012 Triennial and brought international attention to Public Movement.http://bombmagazine.org/article/8295330/dana-yahalomi-public-movement SALONS: Birthright Palestine? was Public Movement\u2019s debut work in the United States === Rebranding European Muslims \u2015 Gala (2012) === Rebranding European Muslims was a campaign that began at the 2012 Berlin Biennial and was continued at a Gala event in Graz. The mission behind this action was to question and investigate conflict surrounding Islam in Europe. To perform this investigation, Public Movement assigned three branding agencies the task of \u2018re-branding\u2019 European Muslims, alongside the notion that \"Branding is doomed to fail, since there is always an unbearable and unbridgeable gap between the image and the reality, between a signifier and a signified\". The three branding agencies that participated were, Demner, Merlicek & Bergmann; Love Tensta; and Metahaven. Each proposal was presented in front of a live audience and the winner was voted on by these audience members. The winning brand agency of the campaign was Demner, Merlicek & Bergmann. The winner was then granted billboard space throughout Graz to showcase their branding campaign. === Honor Guard (2013) === The Honor Guard of R.O.C Veterans performing Honor Guard, created by Public Movement, at the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan (2013) An honor guard, or ceremonial guard, is a ceremonial unit, usually military in nature. Public Movement, with the Veterans Honor Guard of R.O.C. held a weekly ceremonial performance at the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan. This performance was shown to the public throughout the Asian Art Biennial. The audience members were encouraged to use this performance as a means of connecting to and exploring the history and future of Taiwan - a nation free of international recognition, that can thus dance its unspoken trauma, myth and heritage, examine the notion of independence, and acknowledge its violence and unity. Honor Guard was Public Movement\u2019s first action in East Asia. === Debriefing Session II (2016) === Debriefing Session II was a second showcasing of Public Movement\u2019s one-on-one performative methodology, that was also created by Alhena Katsof and Dana Yahalomi. This rendering was performed at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation as a part of But a Storm Is Blowing from Paradise: Contemporary Art of the Middle East and North Africa, and at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, as part of the group's solo exhibition, National Collection. Public Movement invited visitors to meet with an agent who delivers an account of its research about modern art made in Palestine before 1948. The private session draws out the performative relationship between nation-states and their cultural institutions.https://www.guggenheim.org/event/debriefing-session-ii === Choreographies of Power (2016) === Choreographies of Power was an action commissioned as a public program for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation\u2019s But a Storm Is Blowing from Paradise: Contemporary Art of the Middle East and North Africa. This 30-minute procession through the Guggenheim\u2019s collection galleries incorporated elements from the Guggenheim\u2019s history to explore different aspects of the collection\u2019s hidden political tools. As part of the procession, performers \u201cenacted ceremonies, physical encounters, short speeches, and moments of violence.\u201d These specific actions were used to shed light on the complicated reciprocal relationship of the museum spaces and political spaces. It was researched and developed by Public Movement during a mini-residency exploring the collections and archives of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and in a studio residency at Outset Contemporary Art Fund, Tel Aviv.https://www.guggenheim.org/event/choreographies-of-power == Exhibitions == Public Movement performing National Collection in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2015 === National Collection (2015) === National Collection was Public Movement\u2019s first museum exhibition and the first of its kind in Israel. The exhibition was of a series of performances that were shown in the Tel Aviv Museum of art for a period of six weeks. The main focus of this exhibition was to re-align the viewer\u2019s ideas of what a museum is and what the museum space can mean. Public Movement used choreography to understand the museum as a place of re-evaluating a person\u2019s cultural and national identities. By making use of the museum\u2019s own works, histories, and assumed behavioral codes, Public Movement pushed viewers to think twice about a Museum\u2019s allegedly-neutral relationship with political regimes. == Press == === Solution 263: Double Agent (2016) === Solution 263: Double Agent is a book authored by Alhena Katsof, Director of Strategy and Protocol, and Dana Yahalomi, director of Public Movement. The book is a collection of information and instructions needed to perform Debriefing Sessions. It explores the relationship between \u201cthe state and its cultural institutions,\u201d which is a core driving force behind many of Public Movement\u2019s actions. == External Links == Public Movement's Website Public Record The book Solution 263: Double Agent in Sternberg Press website Dana Yahalomi speaking about Public Movement in Artis Video Series (2012) == References == Category:Organizations established in 2006 ",
