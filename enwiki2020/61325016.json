    "text": "Bishop Benjamin Eby was a Canadian minister, schoolteacher, farmer, author, and community leader. He was a pioneer of the Mennonite community in Canada and a strong proponent of nonresistance. Born in 1785, he emigrated to Upper Canada in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land in what would later become Kitchener, Ontario. Plaque 21 He became a Mennonite preacher in 1809, and by 1811 or 1813 had built a log Mennonite meeting house used as a school house and for religious services. He was Bishop from 1812 and was responsible for the growth of Mennonite Church Canada in Waterloo County. Eby authored numerous published works including a hymn book, catechism, several school texts, and a church history. His church history in particular demonstrated \"the nonresistant stance and his belief that war is unacceptable in the Kingdom of God\". Eby encouraged manufacturers to his settlement known as \"Ebytown\". He is credited with encouraging the peaceful coexistence of Mennonites with the rest of the community, and promoted reconciliation and unity on an international scale as well. In his mid-forties, Eby's settlement was renamed from Ebytown to Berlin, and in the year of his death Berlin became the County Seat of the newly created County of Waterloo, elevating it to the status of Village. (It was designated a city in 1912About Kitchener, and renamed as Kitchener in 1916.) ==References== Category:1785 births Category:1853 deaths Category:People from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Christians from Pennsylvania Category:American people of Pennsylvania Dutch descent Category:American Mennonites Category:Canadian Mennonites Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:American people of German descent Category:Canadian people of German descent ",
