P. 341. ==Biography== George Mason was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of James H. and Zelda E. Mason. In 1870 the family moved to Detroit, where Mason received his early education. He began his architectural career working for Detroit architect Hugh Smith in 1875, but this only lasted a summer. After this he moved to the firm of Henry T. Brush, where he worked for the first nine months without pay. Mason started out assigned to some specific detailing work on the George O. Robinson House and the Detroit Public Library.Ferry, W. Hawkins (1980). The Buildings of Detroit: A History. Wayne State University Press, Detroit, Michigan. Pp. 86, 90. One of the first buildings in which Mason received equal billing for the design was the Ransom Gillis House.Ransom Gillis Home . Detroit1701. Retrieved on November 24, 2010. In 1878 he joined with Zachariah Rice to form the firm Mason & Rice. This partnership lasted until 1898, after which time Mason continued his practice alone.Pipp, E.G. (1927). Men Who Have Made Michigan. Pipp's Magazine, Detroit, Michigan. From 1884 until 1896 Albert Kahn worked with Mason and Rice, and he returned to partner with Mason for a few years early in the 20th Century.
