Knijnenburg qualified as a lone shooter for the Bolivian squad in the men's 10 m air pistol at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens after having accepted an invitational berth for his country from the International Shooting Sport Federation with a minimum score of 570. He rounded off the field of forty-seven shooters with the lowest overall score in the prelims, firing at 548 points. Despite missing out his 2008 and 2012 Olympic bid, Knijnenburg's most remarkable feat came at the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, where he finished seventh in the air pistol final with a total of 669.7 points. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Santa Cruz de la Sierra Category:Bolivian male sport shooters Category:Bolivian people of Dutch descent Category:Olympic shooters of Bolivia Category:Shooters at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Shooters at the 2007 Pan American Games Category:Shooters at the 2011 Pan American Games Category:Shooters at the 2015 Pan American Games Category:Shooters at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games competitors for Bolivia Category:South American Games bronze medalists for Bolivia Category:South American Games medalists in shooting Category:Competitors at the 2014 South American Games Category:Shooters at the 2019 Pan American Games ",
