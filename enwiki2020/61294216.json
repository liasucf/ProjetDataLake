His stage roles included Henry IV, Part 1, Penelope, At Swim-Two- Birds, The Spanish Tragedy, The Duchess of Malfi, The Shadow of a Gunman and This Lime Tree Bower. His screen roles included Fair City, Peaky Blinders and Batman Begins. He died suddenly at the age of 47, with a play he had directed underway in Dublin and an ongoing screen role as Robbie Quinn in Fair City. ==Career== He took up performance in the early 1990s, training with the Gaiety School of Acting. In 1998, he debuted with the Abbey Theatre. Among his stage theatre credits were Henry IV, Part 1, Beauty in a Broken Place, At Swim-Two- Birds and The Barbaric Comedies (those four for the Abbey), The Spanish Tragedy, The Duchess of Malfi, The Shadow of a Gunman, Conor McPherson's This Lime Tree Bower and Mark O'Rowe's Howie the Rookie, as well as the Druid Theatre Company production of Enda Walsh's Penelope.

He played Robbie Quinn in the soap opera Fair City between 2014 and his death in 2019. As Quinn he held many high-profile storylines alongside the actress Aisling O'Neill, who portrayed his on-screen lover Carol Foley. Quinn appeared on screen the night before his death in scenes with Carol, and also became embroiled in disputes with the characters Nora and Ray in the same episode. He had worked on set up to two days before dying, the break only coming about due to the arrival of the weekend. He had also been expected to play a leading role in the 30th anniversary episode, scheduled for September 2019. ==Awards and nominations== In 1999, Shiels won Best Actor at the Dublin Theatre Festival for his performance in Comedians.

He worked as an electrician until he turned to acting. In addition, Shiels directed the play Bullfight on Third Avenue, which was running at the Bewley's Cafe Theatre when he died and was scheduled to run throughout the month. ==Death== Karl Shiels died suddenly of natural causes on 15 July 2019, aged 47.
