    "text": "General elections were held in Romania in December 1867 (New Style: December 1867 \u2013 January 1868), and were won by a coalition of liberal-and-radical groups, or \"Concordia Agreement\", formed around incumbent Prime Minister \u0218tefan Golescu. Concordia brought together the left-leaning \"Reds\", the Free and Independent Faction, and a moderate liberal section under Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu. The latter split the moderate vote, ensuring defeat for the opposition led by Ion Ghica, which came in third, after the conservative \"Whites\". The reconfiguration made the country more governable, at a time of financial crisis and riotous disputes over the issue of Jewish emancipation. Controversially, Concordia sought to win over and appease antisemitic voters, although it was itself divided between more and less pliable antisemites. The elections for the Assembly are often described as fraudulent, with the main culprit being Golescu's Interior Minister, Ion Br\u0103tianu; in the Senate race, the accusations of fraud were reciprocal. Despite the liberal sweep, \"Reds\" suffered significant defeats, for instance in Ilfov County, where their candidate Nicolae Haralambie failed to win against Dimitrie Ghica. The national campaign was also steeped in violence, with antisemitic riots in Tutova (following the mysterious death of electee Scarlat V\u00e2rnav) and Ialomi\u021ba County. A far-reaching dispute involved the results in Prahova, where Concordia allegedly used military force to ensure its victory. Disputes over the validation of deputies and senators, including Manolache Costache Epureanu, Petru Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, continued into the early months of 1868. Although victorious, Concordia was eventually brought down by the Factionalists, once Br\u0103tianu shunned their violent antisemitism. Reformed by General Nicolae Golescu, who succeeded his brother as Prime Minister, the \"Reds\" still secured a win in the Senate elections of July 1868. Eventually, however, they lost favor with Domnitor Carol I. The liberal ascendancy ended during the general election of March 1869, which placed the country under a \"White\" government. ==Context== In February 1866, Romania (as the United Principalities had been designated since 1864) was governed by a \"monstrous coalition\" of \"Reds\", \"Whites\" and moderates, chaired by Ion Ghica. Created by a coup which toppled the authoritarian Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, it supervised the April elections\u2014under the preordained assumption that Assembly seats would be evenly split between the \"right\" and the \"left\".Marton, pp. 177\u2013178 The Central Electoral Committee, presided upon by the radical doctrinaire C. A. Rosetti, attempted fraud in various regions (including Prahova County); however, the resulting Assembly was overall dominated by the \"Whites\".Marton, pp. 177\u2013183 At the time, separatism and Cuza loyalism flared up in Western Moldavia, where a riot\u2014instigated by Calinic Miclescu, Teodor Boldur-L\u0103\u021bescu, Constantin Moruzi Pecheanu and Nicu Ceaur- Aslan\u2014was quelled by the Romanian Land Forces.Gane, pp. 102\u2013104; Marton, p. 146 In a parallel plebiscite, Romanians overwhelmingly voted to recognize Carol of Hohenzollern, a German prince, as their new hereditary Domnitor. The regime also instituted Parliament's upper chamber, by reestablishing Cuza's Romanian Senate. Ghica was reconfirmed as Prime Minister, his government claiming to be \"neither right- nor left-wing\".Moroianu, p. 139 His position was weakened by swing deputies and separatist nostalgia, and also by other hurdles: a financial crisis (which had the state borrowing from private bankers),Gane, p. 100; Moroianu, pp. 136\u2013138 a cholera outbreak, and a localized famine.Marton, pp. 183, 190 Moreover, major disputes raged over constitutional details. One point of contention was the status of Romanian Jews, with various \"Reds\" and Moldavians emerging as the core opponents of emancipation and advocates of \"ethnic protectionism\".Marton, pp. 32, 103\u2013104 Therefore, in its final form, the Constitution of July only granted citizenship to Christians, thus reverting a more tolerant Civil Code proclaimed under Cuza.Br\u0103tescu, p. 14 There were repeat elections in November, producing a multicolored Assembly, ridiculed in liberal circles as a \"tutti frutti\" legislature.Marton, p. 183 According to one count of Assembly seats, the radicals shared about 40 seats with their Moldavian allies, or \"Free and Independent Faction\"; there was a conservative majority of approximately 60 seats, but segmented into competing blocs; Ghica's moderate liberals could only count on some 20 deputies.Marton, pp. 183\u2013184; Moroianu, pp. 134\u2013135; Scurtu, p. 298 Another count suggests that Ghica was backed by one third of the Assembly, while the liberals, as the loyal opposition, had another third. Those who rejected the system, be they Cuza loyalists or Moldavian separatists, shared between them the remainder.Moroianu, p. 135; Scurtu, p. 298 Overall, \"there were great clashes of vision between the Assembly majority and the cabinet, as well as between the minority and the cabinet.\"Nicolescu, pp. 23\u201324 The election was criticized from the liberal left as fraudulent in favor of the conservatives and moderates, but other contemporaries generally view it as free and fair.Marton, pp. 184\u2013185 Over the next months, however, disputes blocked the validation of various deputies, contributing to the uncertainty of governance.Marton, pp. 185\u2013190; Nicolescu, pp. 26\u201328 November 1867 cartoon in Ghimpele, the \"Red\" magazine: the \"White\" party, represented by a rabbit-faced Manolache Costache Epureanu, taking Jewish bribes to \"bring down the liberal Ministry\" In March 1867 the radicals were able to seal the Concordia Agreement, allying them with the Free and Independent Faction, chaired by Nicolae Ionescu, and a group of moderate liberals under Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (who commended the allegiance of 25 deputies).Scurtu, p. 298 Tacitly endorsed by Domnitor Carol,Br\u0103tescu, pp. 14, 19 this new coalition was backed by a plurality of Assembly members, eventually pushing Ghica to resign.Marton, pp. 190\u2013191 His \"Red\" replacement, Constantin A. Cre\u021bulescu, was nominally a moderate,Br\u0103tescu, pp. 14\u201315 but the Minister of Internal Affairs, Ion Br\u0103tianu, was a \"Red\" doctrinaire and power-broker, sometimes described as the cabinet's true leader.Marton, pp. 24, 191; Moroianu, p. 140 Possibly pressured by his conditional allies, the antisemitic Factionalists, he also pushed orders to evict Jewish \"vagabonds\" from the countryside, which sparked an international scandal.Br\u0103tescu, pp. 15\u201322; Gane, pp. 115\u2013116; Marton, pp. 24\u201326, 104, 155 By late May, Br\u0103tianu had to deal with \"White\" defiance, manifested when senator Petre Mavrogheni of Ia\u0219i County handed in his resignation. Electors refused to turn up, and sent him a letter expressing contempt that he even organized a scrutiny.Notice and letter of protest in Romanulu, June 8, 1867, p. 470 The Jewish evictions were especially unpopular within the French Empire, to which the liberals looked for guidance, and soon Br\u0103tianu's \"demagoguery\" was castigated by his allies, including \u0218tefan Golescu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter sought to have Br\u0103tianu removed by switching to Ghica's party, and eventually prompted his adversary to resign in July.Br\u0103tescu, pp. 16\u201320. See also Gane, pp. 114\u2013117 During the parliamentary break, Br\u0103tianu's resignation became a full-blown crisis, pushing Cre\u021bulescu to resign in August.Nicolescu, p. 25 In forming a new coalition, liberal- radicals turned to encouraging a maximalist version of Romanian nationalism, which supported \"Greater Romania\" or \"Dacia\"\u2014namely, the incorporation of Transylvania and other territories in Austria-Hungary. The cause was advanced by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Alexandru Candiano-Popescu, who put out the political newspaper Perseveren\u021ba. In summer 1867, traveled across Transylvania to \"assess the conditions for a probable insurrection.\"Maciu, pp. 25\u201326 Hasdeu viewed himself as a future \"Red\" minister, noting in 1871 that the \"Dacian ideal\" was being more openly promoted by that party by 1868.Maciu, p. 24 In October, Golescu officially took over as Prime Minister, and Br\u0103tianu was able to regain influence, eventually resuming his position at Internal Affairs. After filibustering by the \"White\" deputy Manolache Costache Epureanu, Golescu agreed to dissolve the Assembly and called in new elections, noting that the slim majority he had could not support a government in the long run.Nicolescu, pp. 26\u201330. See also Marton, p. 191 According to researcher Constantin Gane, Br\u0103tianu had actually wanted, and worked for, early elections. \"The liberal party\", he argues, \"wanted a Chamber of its own, one that had eluded its grasp for six years, ever since 1862\".Gane, pp. 114\u2013115 Golescu's message was followed on November 29 by Br\u0103tianu's circular letter to the prefects, carried in Monitorul Oficial. Claiming that government had put up no candidates of its own, it asked functionaries to exercise a \"moral influence\" over the electorate, to produce a result in accordance with the national interest\u2014generally seen as code for an election fraud through intimidation.Marton, pp. 191\u2013192 ==Campaign and results== ===Early rounds=== The election was the second one in history to be held under the census suffrage (and weighted voting) law of July 1866, with a two-round system where simple majorities were not decided in one session. The First College comprised voters who owned more than 300 ducats in property, and the Second included those who declared 100\u2013300 ducats; they each elected 33 deputies with direct elections.Marton, p. 174 The Third College corresponded roughly to a \"third estate\", specifically designed for urban constituencies, directly electing 58 deputies in proportion to the respective town population.Marton, pp. 174\u2013175 A Fourth College, representing taxpayers not comprised in the other categories, designated 33 of the total 157 deputies through electors. In 1866\u20131867, there was a 1:50 ratio of electors to registered voters. In the Assembly, where the main rounds took place on December 22\u201326 (Old Style: December 10\u201314),Nicolescu, p. 30 the results were a landslide win for Concordia: Concordia men had 85 seats between them.Scurtu, p. 299 In particular, the election was a victory for \"Red\" hardliners, including Rosetti and Eugeniu Carada (elected in Ilfov's Third and Fourth College, respectively; Carada had 536 votes to 17), but also Gogu Cantacuzino (in Prahova's Fourth College, 550 votes to 9) and Perseveren\u021bas Candiano-Popescu (in Cahul's Fourth College, with 79 votes to 5).Marton, pp. 192\u2013193 In Prahova, where liberals were especially strong and well-organized, the liberal ascendancy was complete, with all seats going to \"Reds\": Anton I. Arion, industrialist Matache Nicolau, and Ploie\u0219ti mayor Constantin T. Grigorescu were also returned by the Third College, as was Corneliu Lapati by the Second.Marton, pp. 193, 199 A \"total triumph\" for both houses of Parliament was also boasted by the liberal chapter of Arge\u0219 County, where George T. Br\u0103tianu and Constantin Hurmuzachi were sent to the Assembly.George T. Br\u0103tianu, \"Impaciurea spiriteloru in ora\u0219iulu Pitesci\", in Romanulu, December 25\u201329, 1867, p. 1106 In some locations, the contest was said to have been mired in dubious practices. One such case was the Fourth College of Vla\u0219ca, where the \"Red\" Grigore Serrurie faced the incumbent, Cezar Bolliac. Rumors recorded by Ghimpele suggest that Bolliac was treating peasant voters to bagels and shots of \u021buic\u0103; in addition, both candidates were alleged to have used ballot stuffing, with the final tallies showing more votes than there were registered voters.Pip\u0103ru\u0219, \"Revista politic\u0103\", in Ghimpele, Nr. 47/1867, p. 2 A complete \"Red\" victory was rendered impossible by several contributing factors, including Factionalist independence. According to one approximation by Ghimpele magazine, the Free and Independent Faction had 14 of the majority deputies: Ionescu, Anastasie F\u0103tu, Alexandru Gheorghiu, Alecu D. Holban, Theodor Late\u0219, Dimitrie Tacu, Nicolae Voinov, Ianache Lecca, Dumitru Lupa\u0219cu, Ioan Negur\u0103, Mantu Rufu, Petre Suciu, I. Strejescu, and Dumitru \u021aanu Vidra\u0219cu.\"Revista politica\", in Ghimpele, Nr. 4/1868, p. 1 Three other winning candidates on the Tutova County list were a local \"National Liberal Party\", allied with the Faction.Iacov Antonovici, Un dasc\u0103l ardelean la B\u00e2rlad: Ioan Popescu, pp. XIV\u2013XV. Hu\u0219i: Atelierele Zanet Corl\u0103\u021beanu, 1928. Ghimpele viewed the Faction as distinct from either the left, right, or center of the resulting legislature, a party \"with only captains, and no footmen.\" Nationally, Concordia also experienced some major defeats: in the First College of Ilfov, government presented Nicolae Haralambie as a \"National Party\" candidate. He lost to the \"White\" leader Dimitrie Ghica, who took 94 votes (more than the absolute majority of 89); Haralambie had 67 votes, and a third-party candidate, Constantin Bosianu, only 15.\"Bucuresc\u012d 18/30 \u00cendrea\", in Romanulu, December 18\u201319, 1867, p. 1080 Similarly, the First College of Vaslui County propelled into office a debuting \"White\", Petre P. Carp, who was just organizing the party chapter in Moldavia.Gane, pp. 117\u2013118 Overall, 34 deputies were conservative \"Whites\", and 30 more were moderates, with 8 more elected as independents.

The liberal press aired allegations of fraud by the \"Whites\": in Olt County, a delegation of electors, including Ioan C\u0103pit\u0103nescu, refused to cast their vote, as a sign of protest.\"D\u2013lu\u012d Redactore al\u016d d\u0326iarulu\u012d Rom\u00e2nul\u016d\", in Romanulu, December 25\u201329, 1867, p. 1106 A separate scandal took hold in the largely non-Romanian constituency of Bolgrad, where Aristid Pascal, the eventual winner, published manifestos addressing Bessarabian Bulgarians in their native tongue. Another controversy involved the \"Red\" newspaper Romanulu, which published archive documents from the 1850s. These purportedly showed that Ioan Manu and Constantin N. Br\u0103iloiu, both of whom ran for Senate as \"Whites\", had plotted a violent clampdown against liberal activists. The votes for Senate were still counted, and in some instances still cast, during January. By January 5, ballotage in the Second Senatorial College awarded mandates to Nicolae Cre\u021bulescu (for Ismail), Emil Casimir (Baia), Ion Pastia (Putna), and Iorgu Scor\u021bescu (Roman); Factionalist leader Ionescu was senator for the University of Ia\u0219i, and Alexandru Or\u0103scu represented the one in Bucharest.\"Senatori Colegiului II.\", in Romanulu, December 24, 1867, p. 1103 Bishop Filaret Scriban, who had initially refrained from running (only urging his fellow Factionalists to elect \"good Christians and good patriots\"),\"Cuv\u0115ntu.

Siediniti'a de la 10 ianuariu\", in Albina, Nr. 6/1868, pp. 2\u20133 Another contentious case was litigated by Bolliac, who had lost Serrurie but still demanded to be recognized as a deputy, and had to be evicted from the Assembly; meanwhile, \"Red\" senator Anton Gugiu was confirmed by his peers in a special vote. According to Ghimpele, Bolliac was denied an opportunity to defend himself from the parliamentary rostrum, despite submitting thirty requests. Deputies voted 62 to 42 not to recognize his claim, but agreed to send in an investigative commission. Another controversy erupted in Tutova County, where, on February 5, virtually all elections were still undecided. The \"White\" candidate for First College, Manolache Costache Epureanu, asked to be recognized as the winner, but the \"Red\" majority called fraud, and the seat was left vacant.\"Romani'a\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 13/1868, pp. 47\u201348 His ouster was welcomed by Ghimpele as a defeat for the philosemitic camp, with Epureanu mockingly referred to as a \"great rabbi of Moldavia\". A related issue was that of Factionalist Scarlat V\u00e2rnav: elected as a Fourth-College deputy, he had died in suspicious circumstances\u2014allegedly poisoned by his Jewish adversaries. While a toxicological investigation was undertaken in Bucharest, at B\u00e2rlad the matter sparked riots, attributed by \"Reds\" to a Jewish provocation.\"Bucuresc\u012d 28 \u00cendrea 1867/9 C\u0103rindari\u016d 1868\", in Romanulu, December 25\u201329, 1867, p. 1105\"D\u2013lu\u012d Redactore al\u016d d\u0326iarulu\u012d Rom\u00e2nul\u016d\", in Romanulu, January 1\u20133, 1868, p. 3; \"Romani'a. In Barladu\", in Gazet'a Transilvaniei, Nr. 3/1868, p. 12 In Prahova, \"White\" bosses Theodor C. V\u0103c\u0103rescu and \u0218tefan Greceanu produced reports and telegrams alleging widespread intimidation by infantry troops and the police, including beatings and arbitrary arrests of opposition mayors and electoral agents; V\u0103c\u0103rescu also refused to sign the proc\u00e8s-verbal validating Prahova's vote count, and urged the Assembly not to validate Gogu Cantacuzino's mandate.Marton, pp. 193\u2013197 However, he himself was being brought to trial by the local prefect, Andrei Dertman, who alleged that V\u0103c\u0103rescu had colluded with the mayor of Pope\u0219ti to get himself fraudulently nominated as a Fourth-College elector.Marton, pp. 195\u2013197 Cantacuzino was finally confirmed on January 21, when the Assembly concluded that Th. C. V\u0103c\u0103rescu's accusations were not certified by an electors' petition, as required by law. A petition signed by 21 Prahova electors was nevertheless registered on the same day. It blamed the local police chief, Stan Popescu, and \"all police agents and footmen, the nightwatchmen, the subprefects with their assistants and the town-hall clerks\", of conspiring to \"reject and mistreat\" known conservative voters.Marton, pp. 196\u2013197 The controversy continued in a more subdued form when deputies of the opposition, including D. Ghica and George D. Vernescu, alongside G. T. Br\u0103tianu, asked for an inquiry into the Prahova affair. Local prosecutors refused to assess the case, dismissing the petition as an attempt to filibuster in the Assembly, while some petitioners backed this by withdrawing their signatures.Marton, pp. 197\u2013199 In Ialomi\u021ba County, accusations of about blood libel, issued against the local Jews, were quickly dismissed by pathologists, and publicly refuted by the liberal press.\"Romani'a. Vuetulu\", in Gazet'a Transilvaniei, Nr. 3/1868, p. 12 Here, the disputed place of deputy in the Second College was eventually awarded to Petru Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu by Assembly vote. Procedural controversies still surrounded Ionache V\u0103c\u0103rescu, who was considered elected, by a slim margin, only after the voters' census was updated,\"Romani'a\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 11/1868, p. 39 and Tache Moscu, whose narrow win was contested by those who argued that a deciding write-in ballot was meant for his brother, Costache. Other disputes regarded the validation of two deputies whose Romanian citizenship was questioned: Constantin Niculescu Catia (or C\u00e2\u021b\u0103) and Procopie S. Sgrumalla.\"Romani'a\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 10/1868, pp. 35\u201336 Hasdeu's election was also contested by emissaries from the Lipovans and Greeks of Bolgrad\u2014their petition was denied by the Assembly, since they had failed to write it in Romanian. ==Aftermath== Br\u0103tianu's claim that the election had not been fixed, and that government had \"no official candidates\", was endorsed by accounts in the contemporary press\u2014local and liberal (Rom\u00e2nul) as well as Western (La France, Le Si\u00e8cle). Overall, the election was validated: in his address to the Assembly, Domnitor Carol congratulated government on running an orderly vote, and arguing that elections had been free, \"only moderated by the people's own common sense.\"Marton, p. 191 Kog\u0103lniceanu also reaffirmed his party's adherence to the \"Red\" party line, praising Br\u0103tianu for having \"transformed the country\". However, Parliament continued to host debilitating disputes, including over allegations that Golescu had sponsored \"Bulgarian bands\" to start a revolution in Danube Vilayet, as well as over the functioning of the Court of Cassation.Gane, pp. 114\u2013124; Nicolescu, pp. 31\u201333 The former accusation, which focused suspicions on the Perseveren\u021ba group, led to Romania being threatened with an international commission of inquiry.Maciu, p. 26 Slowly, a right-wing opposition was consolidating, revitalized by Carp and by Alexandru Lahovary, seen by Gane as \"the two Benjamins of conservative politics\".Gane, p. 117 Antisemitism soon returned as the core issue, when, in Britain, the Earl of Derby cabinet analyzed reports that Romanian Jews were persecuted and prevented from even practicing their religion. The claim was taken up in Romania by Carp, but categorically denied by Br\u0103tianu.Gane, pp. 122\u2013124; Nicolescu, pp. 33\u201335 Government's relationship with the Factionalists was soon put the test when, on March 17, the latter introduced a harshly antisemitic bill, which was ultimately rejected by the mainstream \"Reds\". Asked by the Prime Minister not to voice his dissidence, Br\u0103tianu restated his ethnic nationalism, but agreed that any such xenophobic excess would ruin Romania's fragile relationship with the West.Br\u0103tescu, pp. 22\u201325; Nicolescu, p. 35 This change of attitudes alienated the Faction, and smaller riots erupted in Moldavia, this time specifically targeting both the Jews and Prime Minister Golescu.Br\u0103tescu, pp. 24\u201325 On April 23, the latter resigned, officially for health reasons,Nicolescu, p. 34 and was replaced by his brother, General Golescu, who took an even more moderate position on the \"Jewish Question\". Although faced with a motion of no confidence in Senate (where an alliance of Factionalists and \"Whites\" was formed), he and Br\u0103tianu were able to maintain their hold on power.Br\u0103tescu, pp. 25\u201326; Nicolescu, pp. 35\u201338 Their political survival was especially disappointing for a conservative hopeful, the Dolj deputy George Barbu \u0218tirbei, who missed his opportunity to become Prime Minister, and left on self-imposed exile. Reportedly, his candidacy was rejected by Carol's father, the Prince Hohenzollern, who feared that \u0218tirbei would use his status to usurp the Romanian throne.Gabriel Badea-P\u0103un, \"Gheorghe \u0218tirbey, un diplomat pasionat de art\u0103\", in Muzeul Na\u021bional, Vol. XX, 2008, p. 111 As noted by historian Silvia Marton, \"the words 'moral influence' were destined to have an enviable presence in posterity.\" Br\u0103tianu unwittingly coined a euphemism for \"the systematic government pressure that will characterize the [electoral] regime at the very least until World War I.\"Marton, p. 192 Gane also notes that the practice of \"restricting voters\" only had one precedent (the Moldavian elections of July 1857), but that, after 1867, it \"made a name for itself\".Gane, p. 114 During similarly organized elections in late July, the conservatives also lost the Senate, ensuring that \"Reds\" completely dominated Parliament to March 1869, when the \"White\" party returned in a landslide of its own.Marton, pp. 24, 192\u2013193, 200; Nicolescu, pp. 37\u201338, 42\u201352; Scurtu, p. 299 The sudden fall of radicalism, the loss of favor with Domnitor Carol, and the breakup of Concordia pushed Br\u0103tianu and Candiano-Popescu into conspiratorial politics\u2014leading to the rebellious episode known as \"Republic of Ploie\u0219ti\".Maciu, pp. 26\u201327; Marton, pp. 24\u201328, 32\u201334, 122\u2013124, 166\u2013173, 198sqq ==Notes== ==References== *Liviu Br\u0103tescu, \"C\u0103derea guvernului liberal-radical (1867\u20131868).
