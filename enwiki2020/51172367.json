    "text": "The Nicholas Schoenenberger House and Barn is a historic residence located south of Winterset, Iowa, United States. Nicholas and Louisa (Tinnis) Schoenenberger were both natives of what is now Germany and acquired the title to this farm in 1856. He worked the land until the late nineteenth century, and died here in 1902. Since his death the house has been vacant for long periods of time. with This house is an early example of a vernacular limestone farmhouse. The two-story gable structure is composed of locally quarried finished cut stone on the public facades, the quoins, and the jambs. Rubble stone is used on the other elevations. It also features dressed lintels and window sills. Because it is located on a south facing hillside, the house has a split-level appearance. Because it shares characteristics with other stone houses built in Madison County by local stonemason Caleb Clark, he may have been responsible for its construction. The lower level of the English- style barn is composed of coursed limestone rubble, and the upper level is composed of board-and-batten siding. It is located in a German-style hill setting. The house and barn were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==References== Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Madison County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Barns on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
