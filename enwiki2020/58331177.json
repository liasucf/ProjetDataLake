    "text": "Alexander Coon, M.D. is an American neurosurgeon and Adjunct Professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is known for his work in cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and his research in neuroendovascular devices and clinical outcomes in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and AVMs. == Education and career== Coon attended the University of Kentucky College of Engineering, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering. He attended medical school at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he graduated in 2003. Coon completed his neurosurgical residency and a fellowship in endovascular neurosurgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 2010, he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Radiology and Radiological Science, and has since assumed the position of Director of Endovascular Neurosurgery and the Endovascular Neurosurgery Fellowship Program. In 2011, Coon performed one of the first FDA-approved endovascular flow diversion cases with the Pipeline Embolization Device (Medtronic) and adjunctive coiling to treat a giant cerebral aneurysm. This endovascular treatment of coil-assisted flow diversion avoided the expected functional impairments resulting from an open microsurgical vascular approach. == Research == Coon's research mainly focuses on clinical outcomes associated with neurovascular devices and cerebrovascular microsurgery. His efforts center on developing techniques to push the field of cerebrovascular neurosurgery forward in safe and effective treatment for cerebral aneurysms, arterial dissections, carotid stenosis, AVMs, dural AV fistulas, tumors, and spinal vascular pathology. He has published extensively in the field of aneurysm treatment, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). == Selected publications == * Endovascular flow diversion for treatment of anterior communicating artery region cerebral aneurysms: a single-center cohort of 50 cases.
