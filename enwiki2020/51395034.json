    "text": "All the Sad Young Men is a 1962 album by Anita O'Day, arranged by Gary McFarland and produced by Creed Taylor. ==Reception== Richard S. Ginell reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that on the album O'Day was \"served with a collection of brilliant, difficult big-band charts, courtesy of a 27-year-old emerging master named Gary McFarland who mixed instrumental voices and tempo changes in querulous, turbulent combinations\" and highlighted \"You Came a Long Way From St. Louis\" as being \"enlivened with sprouting shafts of outlaw muted brass and reeds\". Ginell wrote that it was \"...a tribute to O'Day's abilities that she makes it all sound easy, exhibiting a freedom in phrasing and improvising that is extraordinary even for her\". == Track listing == # \"Boogie Blues\" (Remo Biondi, Gene Krupa) \u2013 3:44 # \"You Came a Long Way from St. Louis\" (John Benson Brooks, Bob Russell) \u2013 4:12 # \"I Want to Sing a Song\" (Margo Guryan, Gary McFarland) \u2013 2:42 # \"A Woman Alone with the Blues\" (Willard Robison) \u2013 3:18 # \"The Ballad of the Sad Young Men\" (Fran Landesman, Tommy Wolf) \u2013 4:23 # \"Do Nothing till You Hear from Me\" (Duke Ellington, Russell) \u2013 4:08 # \"One More Mile\" (McFarland, Bobby Paxton) \u2013 2:39 # \"Night Bird\" \u2013 3:56 # \"Up State\" (McFarland) \u2013 2:30 # \"Se\u00f1or Blues\" (Horace Silver) \u2013 2:45 == Personnel == *Anita O'Day \u2013 vocals *Bernie Glow, Herb Pomeroy, Doc Severinsen \u2013 trumpet *Bob Brookmeyer, Willie Dennis \u2013 trombone *Phil Woods, Walter Levinsky \u2013 clarinet, alto saxophone *Zoot Sims \u2013 tenor saxophone, woodwind *Hank Jones \u2013 piano *Barry Galbraith \u2013 guitar *George Duvivier \u2013 double bass *Mel Lewis \u2013 drums *Gary McFarland \u2013 arranger, conductor ===Production=== *Sung Lee \u2013 art direction, design *Suzanne White \u2013 design coordinator *Richard Seidel \u2013 executive producer *Dom Cerulli \u2013 liner notes *Kevin Reeves \u2013 mastering *Pete Turner \u2013 photography *Creed Taylor \u2013 producer *Rudy Van Gelder \u2013 engineer *Tom Greenwood \u2013 production assistant *Carlos Kase, Bryan Koniarz, Terri Tierney \u2013 production coordination *Ben Young \u2013 research, restoration *Jerry Rappaport \u2013 supervisor *Deborah Hay \u2013 text editor ==References== Category:1962 albums Category:Albums arranged by Gary McFarland Category:Albums produced by Creed Taylor Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Anita O'Day albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
