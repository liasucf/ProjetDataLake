Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England 1530-1630. New York: Rizzoli, 1995. , p. 198-199 Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset (18 March 1589 \u2013 28 March 1624) was the eldest surviving son of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset, by his first wife, Margaret, a daughter of the Duke of Norfolk. Born at Charterhouse, London, Sackville was styled Lord Buckhurst from 1608 until 1609, when he succeeded his father as Earl of Dorset and inherited the family home of Knole House. During the years 1612-24 Sackville served as a Lord Lieutenant of Sussex. Sackville is perhaps best remembered as the first husband of Lady Anne Clifford. They married on 27 February 1609, but their marriage was not a success; partisans of the Earl tended to blame Lady Anne's powerful personality, while partisans of the Countess pointed to the Earl's repeated infidelities, not to mention his extravagance and indebtedness \u2013 \"one of the seventeenth century\u2019s most accomplished gamblers and wastrels\".Robert M Cooper, The Literary Guide and Companion to Southern England (Ohio University Press, 1998) A rumour noted later by the antiquary John Aubrey had it that one of Richard Sackville's \"concubines\" was Venetia Stanley. She was said to have had children by him and he settled upon her an annuity of \u00a3500 per annum.Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, s.v. \"Sir Kenelm Digby\", p. 98 Among the Earl's other mistresses was Martha Penistone, the wife of Sir Thomas Penistone, one of the Earl's retinue.DJH Clifford (ed), The Diaries of Lady Anne Clifford (Sutton Publishing, 2003, note p 83) At the time of their marriage, Lady Anne had been in a long-running legal contest over her inheritance rights; in 1617, the 3rd Earl signed away her claim on contested ancestral lands to James I, in return for a cash payment which the Earl used to pay off his gambling debts.Shakespeare Studies Vol. 25 (1997), p. 242. The 3rd Earl and Lady Anne had five children between 1612 and 1621; however none of their three sons, born in 1616, 1618, and 1621, survived their father. Their two daughters, Isabella (born 6 October 1622, died 22 August 1661) and Margaret (born 2 July 1614,http://www.thePeerage.com died May 1676) were longer lived. Margaret became the wife of John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet. The 3rd Earl died at Dorset House,Dorset House stood to the south of Fleet Street London without a male heir on Easter Sunday of 1624 at Dorset House, London, and was succeeded by his younger brother Edward Sackville. He was buried on 7 April 1624 at St. Michael's Parish Church in Withyham, Sussex. ==References== ==External links== * Anonymous portrait. |- Category:Lord- Lieutenants of Sussex Category:1589 births Category:1624 deaths Richard Category:Earls of Dorset ",
