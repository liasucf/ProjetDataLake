He was a researcher and manager at IBM Research since 1955 for over forty years before retiring.Cf. bio in letter of recommendation for his wife, Dr. Linda D. Misek-Falkoff, to the Internet Governance Caucus IGF Multi-Stakeholder Advisory Group He collaborated with Ken Iverson from 1960 to 1980 on the design, development, and use of the APL programming language and interactive environment. Of special note is his landmark article, A Formal Description of System/360, describing the then new IBM System/360 computer system, formally, in APL programming notation. Falkoff was a visiting member of the faculty of IBM's Systems Research Institute, and taught computer science at Yale University. He was one of the researchers who established and managed the IBM Philadelphia Scientific Center and received many awards for his work, especially with APL. ==Representative publications== *Adin D.
