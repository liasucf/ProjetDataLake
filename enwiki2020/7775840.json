As of April 2017, more than 800 had been produced.Optare Versa Bus Lists on the Web ==Description== First Manchester Optare Versa Hybrid in April 2013 (with vertical headlamps) Optare designed the Versa to fill a gap in its bus product range between the larger Tempo full-size single-decker bus and the smaller Solo minibus. Some operators of the longest of Optare's minibus-derived Solo models commented that the 7.0m wheelbase was too long, reducing manoeuvrability, which resulted from the Solo's front axle being ahead of the passenger entrance. It was officially launched at the Euro Bus Expo 2006 at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in November 2006, with the first order of 25 buses being placed by Stagecoach.Stylish new bus from Optare Bus & Coach Professional 1 November 2006Stagecoach places \u00a39m order for 100 new buses Stagecoach Group 7 November 2006Stagecoach orders 100 from Optare Bus & Coach Professional 15 November 2006 The Versa, with its entrance ahead of the front axle, considerably reduces the wheelbase, to either 5.13m or 5.82m (depending upon whether the overall length is 10.3m or 11m respectively). It is designed to seat between 36 and 40 passengers. The Versa has a typical Optare design, with a swooping roof line, large glazed area and swept-back front which takes many of its styling cues from the Solo, but with a more modern, updated appearance. ==Hybrid electric version== In 2010, a hybrid electric version was introduced with the first 68 ordered by Transport for Greater Manchester, 20 of them were introduced on the FirstBus operated Metroshuttle routes in November 2010, while others were operated by Maytree Travel.Freedom of the city with Manchester Metroshuttle 2 November 2010Manchester 9 million hybrid school fleet Bus & Coach Professional 26 April 2012 ==Electric version== In 2012, an electric version was introduced with Travel DeCourcey ordering three in 2010, entering service on the Coventry Park & Ride.
