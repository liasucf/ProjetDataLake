Jos\u00e9 Antonio Estudillo was appointed administrator and majordomo at Mission San Luis Rey in 1840. Three grants, comprising over of the former Mission San Luis Rey lands in the San Jacinto area were made to the Estudillo family: Rancho San Jacinto Viejo to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Estudillo in 1842; Rancho San Jacinto Nuevo y Potrero to his son-in-law, Miguel Pedrorena, in 1846; and the five square league Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante to his daughter, Mar\u00eda del Rosario Estudillo, in 1846.John W.

Before she died, Aguirre had been married to Mar\u00eda del Rosario's sister, Francisca Estudillo, eldest daughter of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Estudillo. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguirre owned one-half of Rancho El Tejon.Mary H.

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho San Jacinto Sobrante was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852.United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 80 SD In 1854, the Commission found that Mar\u00eda del Rosario Estudillo de Aguirre was entitled to five square leagues of land. The US District Court in 1855, however, held that the claimant was entitled to eleven square leagues, if so much should be found within the sobrante, and to all that was found therein if it were less than that amount. An appeal taken to the US Supreme Court in 1863, affirmed the eleven square leagues, United States v.
