    "text": "\"Rocky Top\" is an American country and bluegrass song written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant in 1967 and first recorded by the Osborne Brothers later that same year. The song, which is a city dweller's lamentation over the loss of a simpler and freer existence in the hills of Tennessee, is one of Tennessee's ten official state songs and has been recorded by dozens of artists from multiple musical genres worldwide since its publication. In U.S. college athletics, \"Rocky Top\" is associated with the Tennessee Volunteers of the University of Tennessee (UT), whose Pride of the Southland Band has played a marching band version of the song at the school's sporting events since the early 1970s. The Osborne Brothers' 1967 bluegrass version of the song reached No. 33 on the U.S. Country charts, and Lynn Anderson's 1970 version peaked at No. 17 on the U.S. Country charts. In 2005, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ranked \"Rocky Top\" number seven on its list of 100 Songs of the South.Bryan Perry (producer), Shane Harrison, Sonia Murray, Nick Marino, and Soyia Ellison, 100 Songs of the South. Retrieved: September 20, 2009. ==Background== \"Rocky Top\" was written by married songwriting duo Boudleaux Bryant (1920-1987) and Felice Bryant (1925-2003) in 1967. At the time, the Bryants were working at The Gatlinburg Inn in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on a collection of slow-tempo songs for a project for Archie Campbell and Chet Atkins. Writing the fast-paced \"Rocky Top,\" which took about 10 minutes to write, served as a temporary diversion for them. While the song became a staple of the Osborne Brothers concerts in the late 1960s, the song did not achieve mass popularity until the early 1970s, when Lynn Anderson's version reached number seventeen on the Billboard Country Top 100. In 1972, UT's Pride of the Southland Band first played the song as part of one of its drills, the idea and arrangement being primarily the work of band arranger Barry MacDonald. The song was deemed popular enough to be played at a halftime country music show by guest saxophone soloist Boots Randolph at a game in Knoxville against Alabama on October 21, 1972, gaining fans' attention. Randolph reprised his jazzy \"Rocky Top\" solo when Tennessee played LSU on New Year's Eve, 1972 in the Astro- Bluebonnet Bowl at the Houston Astrodome. UT recognized the song's appeal and the band started playing Rocky Top at every game. Longtime band director W.J. Julian stated that if Rocky Top was ever not played, then there would be a mutiny among Vol fans, reflecting the song's deep-rooted foundation in UT sports. The song was officially adopted as the fifth Tennessee state song in 1982.Bill Williams, Our Stories: Rocky Top. WBIR.com, November 19, 2008. Retrieved: September 20, 2009. In the 1970s, the song achieved such popularity among bar crowds that the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based old- time band the Red Clay Ramblers' national tours included a crowd-pleasing satire informally titled \"Play 'Rocky Top' (or I'll Punch Your Lights Out.)\" The Bryants' children currently own the rights to the song under the corporate name \"House of Bryant,\"Clay Carey, \"'Rocky Top' Clip Puts Network A&E; in Court.

In the song's opening verse, the singer longs for a place called \"Rocky Top,\" where there is no \"smoggy smoke\" and there are no \"telephone bills.\" The singer reminisces about a love affair he once had on Rocky Top with a woman \"wild as a mink\" and \"sweet as soda pop.\" The song's second verse recalls a story about two \"strangers\" (apparently revenue agents) climbing Rocky Top \"looking for a moonshine still,\" but never returning (conflict between moonshiners and \"revenuers\" is a common theme in Appalachian culture).For discussion of moonshining in Southern Appalachia, see Horace Kephart's Our Southern Highlanders (1922) and Joseph Dabney's Mountain Spirits (1974). The song says that the soil on Rocky Top is too rocky to grow corn, so the people of Rocky Top \"get their corn from a jar\". In the third and final verse (which consists of just four lines), the singer again longs for the \"simple\" life, likening life in the city to being \"trapped like a duck in a pen.\" ===College fight song=== \"Rocky Top\" is a favorite of UT fans, alumni, and others who sing it while the Vols play at Neyland Stadium and Thompson\u2013Boling Arena. House of Bryant has granted the University of Tennessee a perpetual license to play the song as much and as often as success on the field dictates. Pride of the Southland Band assistant director and arranger Barry McDonald created a marching band arrangement Charlene Harb, former wife of McDonaldthat was first played at the Vols' October 21, 1972, game against the Alabama Crimson Tide.Tom Mattingly, The University of Tennessee Trivia Book (Hill Street Press, 2007) Over the years, \"Rocky Top\" has become so closely associated with UT that many people believe it to be the school's fight song. However, UT's official fight song is \"Down the Field\".University of Tennessee -- Songs of Tennessee . Retrieved: September 20, 2009. Regardless of its lack of official status, in 2015, \"Rocky Top\" was designated the #1 fight song in college football, based on a \"cumulative data-based ranking of America's most engaged fan bases\" by USA Today. One Tennessee tradition related to the song and similar to that of other schools is to have the team's quarterback conduct the marching band in performing the song after a big win, with Peyton Manning popularizing the tradition when he was Tennessee quarterback.Rocky Top (University of Tennessee Feature) YouTube ===Location of Rocky Top=== Rocky Top and the Appalachian Trail While the Bryants never indicated that \"Rocky Top, Tennessee\" refers to a specific place, some have suggested that a barren summit known as \"Rocky Top\"-- located in the Great Smoky Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border-- is the best fit, due in large part to its proximity to Gatlinburg, where the song was written.Robert Silvers, \"Hit Song Born at Gatlinburg Inn.\" Saturday Evening Post, June 26, 2009.

The name \"Rocky Top\" is sometimes used as a nickname for East Tennessee, the city of Knoxville, and the University of Tennessee (especially its two major athletic venues, Neyland Stadium and the Thompson\u2013Boling Arena). \"Rocky Top\" is also a popular name for East Tennessee businesses, among them a real estate agency and a chain of convenience stores.

The focus of the investigation was the illegal sale of bingo licenses. ==Notable covers== Phish played \"Rocky Top\" regularly from 1987 to 2003 and, after reforming, again in 2009.

The country rock group the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band tackled the song on their 1976 compilation album Dirt, Silver and Gold.
