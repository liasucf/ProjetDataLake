The larvae feed on the leaves of gum trees. The adult moths are brown, sometimes with black smudges and scalloped submarginal lines on the forewings and a reddish shading on the hindwings. The wings have scalloped edges, and the forewing tips are recurved. The wingspan is about 6 centimeters. Its natural posture has the wings closed like a tent over the body, with the tip of the abdomen curved upward. ==References== Category:Oenochrominae Category:Taxa named by Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer ",
