    "text": "\"The Old Man in the Cave\" is a half-hour episode of the original version of The Twilight Zone. It is set in a post-apocalyptic 1974, ten years after a nuclear holocaust in the United States. The episode is a cautionary tale about humanity's greed and the danger of questioning one's faith in forces greater than oneself. ==Opening narration== ==Plot== In a sparsely populated town in 1974, ten years after a nuclear war has devastated the US, the townspeople have discovered a supply of canned food. However, they are waiting for Mr. Goldsmith, the town's leader, to return with a message from the mysterious and unseen \"old man in the cave\" who will tell them whether the food is contaminated with radiation. Some of the townsfolk want to take their chances and eat the food, but they refrain from doing so after seeing the disastrous harvest yielded when they failed to take the old man's advice about which farming areas were contaminated. When Mr. Goldsmith returns, he informs them that the old man has declared the food is contaminated and that it should be destroyed. Shortly thereafter, a group of soldiers led by Major French enter the town and clash with Goldsmith as they try to establish their authority. The soldiers may or may not be representatives of the US government; Goldsmith claims that wandering packs of self-styled military men have previously intruded on the town and tried to establish authority\u2014all unsuccessfully. French, meanwhile, reveals that there are maybe 500 people left alive between Buffalo, New York and Atlanta, Georgia, and also talks of small, isolated primitive societies on the shores of Lake Erie and in \"what used to be\" Chicago. He claims his job is to organize the region so that society can be re-built. However, Goldsmith believes that French and his men simply want to strip the town of its food. A clash of wills ensues and, frustrated by Goldsmith's quiet and steadfast refusal to bend, French tries to dispel the townspeople's strange beliefs about the seemingly infallible old man in the cave and take control of the area. French tempts the townspeople with some of the food Goldsmith claimed was contaminated and many throw caution to the wind and partake. Everyone except Goldsmith eventually consumes the food and drink and Goldsmith falls into disfavor among the townspeople. After being bullied and threatened with his life, Goldsmith finally opens the cave door and it is ultimately revealed that in reality, the townsfolk have been using information from a computer the whole time. French rallies the townspeople into a frothing frenzy into destroying the machine, after which French leads the people into celebrating their new found freedom from this \"tyranny\". However, as Mr. Goldsmith had insisted, the \"old man\" was correct; without an authority figure to tell them which foods are safe, the entire human population of the town (including French and the soldiers) die\u2014except for the lone survivor, Mr. Goldsmith, who somberly walks out of the now dead town. ==Closing narration== ==Episode notes== In the post-apocalyptic world presented in the episode, humanity has destroyed itself, but does so through \"greed, desire and faithlessness\". It is thus a warning not to ignore faith, which often serves an important purpose in society. The events in the episode show that myths and beliefs are often based on fact or necessity, as is the case with the \"old man\" who, despite being a computer, was ultimately keeping his \"followers\" alive. According to Valerie Barr of Hofstra University, it also \"turns the usual notion of overreliance on technology on its head\" by suggesting an interdependence with machines when it is revealed that a man-made computer has been keeping the townspeople alive. A suggested learning plan accompanying this episode for the SyFy Channel's participation in Cable in the Classroom provides a platform for exploring ideas about war, faith, and the question of whether humans control computers or vice versa. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted in his review of \"Time Enough at Last\" that, at the time The Twilight Zone was produced, depicting an atom bomb explosion or its aftermath on network television would likely have been prohibited if it had been \"couched in a more realistic format\".Sarris, Andrew. Rod Serling: Viewed From Beyond the Twilight Zone. Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine, March\u2013April 1985, p. 45 Hence, in both this episode and \"The Shelter\", Serling makes a point of noting that the story is intended to be fictional, particularly given both are set in the United States. ==References== *DeVoe, Bill.
