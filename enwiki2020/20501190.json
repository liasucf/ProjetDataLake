Previously of Sporting and Braga, he did not break into the first teams of either club, but did so at Rio Ave, helping them to two domestic cup finals in 2014. He also played several seasons in Turkey's S\u00fcper Lig, making over 100 appearances for Osmanl\u0131spor and Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc. Pinto was a Portuguese youth international. ==Club career== ===Early years=== Pinto was born in Porto. After receiving his first football lessons at S.L. Benfica, both he and his father joined neighbouring Sporting CP, and the 12-year-old went on to complete his development at the Jos\u00e9 Alvalade Stadium. For 2007\u201308, Pinto was loaned to C.D. Olivais e Moscavide of the third division, and spent the following campaign with Primeira Liga newcomers C.D. Trofense; On 18 April 2009 he scored his first goal in the competition, as consolation in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Rio Ave FC; in September, after cutting ties with Sporting, he signed a four-year contract with S.C. Braga. During his first and only season, Pinto made no competitive appearances as the Minho side finished in second position. ===Rio Ave=== Pinto was released in summer 2010, and joined fellow top-flight club Rio Ave. He arrived to replace Braga-bound S\u00edlvio, and had previously failed a medical at Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. On 3 September 2012, Pinto was loaned to Spanish side Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a for one year, without the option to purchase. He was presented before 200 fans at the Estadio Riazor and joined several compatriots at his new team, making his official debut on 1 November by playing the entirety of a 1\u20131 home draw with RCD Mallorca in the last-32 stage of the Copa del Rey and also featuring three minutes in place of Juan Dom\u00ednguez in the goalless second leg four weeks later, with the subsequent elimination on the away goals rule; between those two cup matches he appeared in his only game for them in La Liga, starting and finishing the 3\u20135 loss at Real Zaragoza. On 11 January 2013, as he was only third-choice at his position behind Ayoze and Evaldo, Pinto's loan at Deportivo ended and he moved to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n's Racing de Santander for the remainder of the campaign. His only goal for the Cantabrians arrived on 23 February, concluding a 2\u20130 home victory over CD Mirand\u00e9s, but the club eventually suffered a second consecutive relegation. In 2014, Pinto was an unused substitute as Rio Ave lost the finals of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga and the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal to Benfica. He played against the same team in that year's Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira, missing in the penalty shootout to hand the opposition the title. ===Turkey=== In July 2015, Pinto signed for Osmanl\u0131spor, newly promoted to Turkey's S\u00fcper Lig. In his first season in Ankara, the side came fifth and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; on 28 July 2016 he scored his first goal, the only one of a home win against N\u00f5mme Kalju FC in the competition's third qualifying round, and in the play-off on 25 August he netted both of a defeat of FC Midtjylland also at the Osmanl\u0131 Stadium. Pinto moved on a three-year contract to another promoted team in the Turkish capital in July 2018, MKE Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc. In his second match on 19 August, he concluded a 2\u20130 win at Alanyaspor. ==International career== Pinto won 25 caps for Portugal at youth level, including two for the under-21s. He was called up to the full side for the first time on 31 March 2015 for a friendly with Cape Verde, remaining on the bench in the 0\u20132 defeat in Estoril. ==Personal life== Pinto was the son of Jo\u00e3o Pinto, whom successfully represented Benfica, Sporting and the Portugal national team. In June 2009, he married B\u00e1rbara Brilhante at the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery in Lisbon, and the couple have a son and a daughter together. Pinto's uncle, S\u00e9rgio, competed mostly in the Portuguese lower divisions, also spending a season at England's Bradford City. ==See also== *List of association football families ==References== ==External links== * * *National team data * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Porto Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:Sporting CP footballers Category:C.D.
