    "text": "Green North Regional Force (, FRNV) was a Chilean regionalist political party active only in the Coquimbo Region. It was legally constituted by the Electoral Service of Chile between 2015 and 2017. ==History== It was founded on October 26, 2015 (as recorded in the public deed issued on 22 December 2015 in the Official Journal of the Republic of Chile to establish its constitution) by various split personalities of the New Majority disenchanted with the government of Michelle Bachelet. The founders of the party made the decision after Bachelet replace the Intendant of the Region of Coquimbo Hanne Utreras (current vice president of the party) by Claudio Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. The creation of the party had the support of prominent political figures in the region, as the deputy Sergio Gahona (UDI). In its statement, Green North Regional Force claims to be a regionalist and progressive party, whose primary focus is the human being and its rights. Their registration was initially rejected on 4 July 2016 by failing to reach the minimum of signatures required, however on July 13 the errors were corrected and the party was finally registered legally by the Electoral Service in the Region of Coquimbo. The party will participate in the municipal elections of 2016, in which the party would provide support for the candidates for mayor in Combarbal\u00e1 (Gustavo Hernandez), La Serena (Hanne Utreras), Punitaqui (Pedro Valdivia) and R\u00edo Hurtado (Edgar \u00c1ngel). It also will submit lists of candidates for councilors in all municipalities of the Region of Coquimbo. Despite being active only in the Region of Coquimbo, the party aims to expand to other regions in the future. It has also announced that it will present candidates in parliamentary elections and regional councilors to be held in 2017. In January 2017, the party agreed to merge with the Regional and Popular Front, the Social Agrarian Regionalist Independent Movement, and We Are Ays\u00e9n to form the Social Green Regionalist Federation (Federaci\u00f3n Regionalista Verde Social, FREVS). It was officially dissolved on April 25, 2017, when the constitution of the FREVS was legalized. ==References== ==External links== * Official site (in Spanish) Category:Political parties in Chile Category:Political parties established in 2015 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2017 Category:2015 establishments in Chile Category:2017 disestablishments in Chile Category:Regionalist parties ",
