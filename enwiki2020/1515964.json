The Wedge Strategy is a creationist political and social action plan authored by the Discovery Institute, the hub of the pseudoscientific intelligent design movement. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute manifesto known as the Wedge Document. Its goal is to change American culture by shaping public policy to reflect politically conservative fundamentalist evangelical Protestant values. The wedge metaphor is attributed to Phillip E. Johnson and depicts a metal wedge splitting a log. Intelligent design is the religiousSee for example: * From an Open Letter published in the Dallas Morning News * Decision in Kitzmiller v.

William A. Dembski.

Implicit in the intelligent design doctrine is a redefining of science and how it is conducted (see theistic science). Wedge strategy proponents are opposed to materialism,\" \"From our vantage, materialism is not a neutral, value-free, minimalist position from which to pursue inquiry. Rather, it is itself an ideology with an agenda. What's more, it requires an evolutionary creation story to keep it afloat. On scientific grounds, we regard that creation story to be false. What?s more, we regard the ideological agenda that has flowed from it to be destructive to rational discourse. Our concerns are therefore entirely parallel to the evolutionists?. Indeed, all the evolutionists? worst fears about what the world would be like if we succeed have, in our view, already been realized through the success of materialism and evolution. Hence, as a strategy for unseating materialism and evolution, the term \"Wedge\" has come to denote an intellectual and cultural movement that many find congenial.\" Dealing with the backlash against intelligent design William Dembski. 2004.\"If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. With the assistance of many friends I have developed a strategy for doing this....We call our strategy the \"wedge.\" Phillip Johnson, Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds, 1997, pp. 91-92\"The overthrow of matter in physics and biology requires a return to the social issues that are treated in Rerum Novarum and Centesimus Annus. ...

The Acton Institute, May 1, 1997 naturalism,\"The most severe challenge to theology over the last two hundred years has been naturalism. Within western culture, naturalism has become the default position for all serious inquiry. From biblical studies to law to education to art to science to the media, inquiry is expected to proceed only under the supposition of naturalism. ...If fully successful, Intelligent Design will unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy.\" The Intelligent Design Movement William Dembski. and evolution,\"...there is an immediate payoff to intelligent design: it destroys the atheistic legacy of Darwinian evolution. Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.

I think at a fundamental level, in terms of what drives me in this is that I think God's glory is being robbed by these naturalistic approaches to biological evolution, creation, the origin of the world, the origin of biological complexity and diversity. When you are attributing the wonders of nature to these mindless material mechanisms, God's glory is getting robbed...And so there is a cultural war here.

The New Republic, August 11, 2005.\"The objective of the Wedge Strategy is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism vs. evolution to the existence of God vs. the non-existence of God.

(PDF file)Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science Phillip E. Johnson. DarwinReconsidered.org. The strategy was originally brought to the public's attention when the Wedge Document was leaked on the Web. The Wedge strategy forms the governing basis of a wide range of Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns. ==Overview== The Wedge Document outlines a public relations campaign meant to sway the opinion of the public, popular media, charitable funding agencies, and public policy makers. The document sets forth the short-term and long-term goals with milestones for the intelligent design movement, with its governing goals stated in the opening paragraph: * \"To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\" * \"To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God\" There are three Wedge Projects, referred to in the strategy as three phases designed to reach a governing goal: * Scientific Research, Writing, and Publicity * Publicity and Opinion-making * Cultural Confrontation & Renewal Recognizing the need for support, the institute affirms the strategy's Christian, evangelistic orientation: The wedge strategy was designed with both five-year and twenty-year goals in mind in order to achieve the conversion of the mainstream. One notable component of the work was its desire to address perceived social consequences and to promote a social conservative agenda on a wide range of issues including abortion, euthanasia, sexuality, and other social reform movements. It criticized \"materialist reformers [who] advocated coercive government programs\" which it referred to as \"a virulent strain of utopianism\". Beyond promotion of the Phase I goals of proposing Intelligent Design-related research, publications, and attempted integration into academia, the wedge strategy places an emphasis on Phases II and III advocacy aimed at increasing popular support of the Discovery Institute's ideas. Support for the creation of popular-level books, newspaper and magazine articles, op-ed pieces, video productions, and apologetics seminars was hoped to embolden believers and sway the broader culture towards acceptance of intelligent design. This, in turn, would lead the ultimate goal of the wedge strategy; a social and political reformation of American culture. In 20 years, the group hopes that they will have achieved their goal of making intelligent design the main perspective in science as well as to branch out to ethics, politics, philosophy, theology, and the fine arts. A goal of the wedge strategy is to see intelligent design \"permeate religious, cultural, moral and political life.\" By accomplishing this goal the ultimate goal as stated by the Center for Science and Culture (CSC) of the \"overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural legacies\" and reinstating the idea that humans are made in the image of God, thereby reforming American culture to reflect conservative Christian values, will be achieved. The preamble of the Wedge DocumentThe Wedge Strategy - Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture is mirrored largely word-for-word in the early mission statement of the CSC, then called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. The theme is again picked up in the controversial book From Darwin to Hitler authored by Center for Science and Culture Fellow Richard Weikart and published with the center's assistance.From Darwin to Hitler webpage, published under the banner of the CSC and the Discovery Institute The wedge strategy was largely authored by Phillip E. Johnson, and features in his book The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism. ==Origins== ===Wedge Document=== Drafted in 1998 by Discovery Institute staff, the Wedge Document first appeared publicly after it was posted to the World Wide Web on February 5, 1999, by Tim Rhodes,virus: A Peek Behind Enemy Lines Tim Rhodes. ChurchOfVirus.org, February 5, 1999. having been shared with him in late January 1999 by Matt Duss, a part-time employee of a Seattle-based international human-resources firm. There Duss had been given a document to copy titled The Wedge and marked \"Top Secret\" and \"Not For Distribution.\"Discovery's Creation Roger Downey. Seattle Weekly, February 1, 2006. Meyer once claimed that the Wedge Document was stolen from the Discovery Institute's offices.\"Q. Now is it true that that document was purportedly stolen from the office of Discovery Institute? A. According to Dr. Meyer that's what happened.\" Barbara Forrest, 2005, testifying in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial. , p. 41 Discovery Institute co-founder and CSC Vice President Stephen C. Meyer eventually acknowledged the Institute as the source of the document. The Institute still seeks to downplay its significance, saying \"Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the 'Wedge' document\"., Discovery Institute staff, February 3, 2006 The Institute also portrays the scientific community's reaction to the Wedge document as driven by \"Darwinist Paranoia.\"The \"Wedge Document\": How Darwinist Paranoia Fueled an Urban Legend Discovery Institute staff, July, 2005. Despite insisting that intelligent design is not a form of creationism, the Discovery Institute chose to use an image of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, depicting God reaching out to impart life from his finger into Adam. ===Movement and strategy=== According to Phillip E. Johnson, the wedge movement, if not the term, began in 1992: In 1993, a year after the SMU conference, \"the Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars met at Pajaro Dunes. Here, Behe presented for the first time the seed thoughts that had been brewing in his mind for a year--the idea of 'irreducibly complex' molecular machinery.\"Meeting Darwin's Wager Christianity Today Magazine. April 28, 1997 Vol. 41, No. 5, Page 14. quoted in Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics, Robert T. Pennock, p8 Nancy Pearcey, a CSC fellow, and Johnson associate acknowledges Johnson's leadership of the intelligent design movement in two of her most recent publications. In an interview with Johnson for World magazine, Pearcey says, \"It is not only in politics that leaders forge movements. Phillip Johnson has developed what is called the 'Intelligent Design' movement.\"Wedge Issues, Phillip Johnson Interview, July 29, 2000.World Magazine: Pearcey, Nancy In Christianity Today, she reveals Johnson's religious beliefs and his animosity toward evolution and affirms Johnson as \"The unofficial spokesman for ID.\"Access Research Network in the WindowView In his 1997 book Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds Johnson summed up the underlying philosophy of the strategy: At the 1999 \"Reclaiming America for Christ Conference\" called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Johnson gave a speech called How the Evolution Debate Can Be Won. In it he summed up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for winning the battle: Johnson cites the foundation of intelligent design as The Gospel According to Saint John, in the New Testament, specifically, Chapter 1:1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (King James Version). The 1999 establishment of the Michael Polanyi Center at Baylor University by Baylor president Robert B. Sloan was a major step forward in the Wedge Strategy. The center was directed by William Dembski and Bruce L. Gordon, with funding from the John Templeton Foundation via the Discovery Institute. The center was disbanded the next year in the face of protests from Baylor's faculty and the recommendation of an outside advisory council. By 2005 Baylor had also hired two other wedge proponents, Walter Bradley and Francis J. Beckwith. Elaborating on the goals and methods of wedge strategy, Johnson stated in an interview conducted in 2002 for Touchstone Magazine that \"The mechanism of the wedge strategy is to make it attractive to Catholics, Orthodox, non- fundamentalist Protestants, observant Jews, and so on.\" He went on to elaborate: Other statements of Johnson's acknowledge that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic and creationist agenda cast as a scientific concept. Critics claim that Johnson's statements validate claims leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping religious content from their anti- evolution, creationist assertions as a means of avoiding the separation of church and state mandated by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, page 138 The statements, when viewed in the light of the Wedge document and the US District Court's Kitzmiller decision, show ID and the ID movement is an attempt to put a gloss of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief.Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, page 29 The wedge strategy details a simultaneous assault on state boards of education, state and federal legislatures and on the print and broadcast media.\"Alongside a focus on the influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. Well, will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidence that support the faith, as well as \"popularize\" our ideas in the broader culture.\" The Wedge Strategy Discovery Institute, Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. 1998 (PDF file) The Discovery Institute has carried out the strategy through its role in the intelligent design movement, where it aggressively promoted ID and its Teach the Controversy campaign to the public, education officials and public policymakers.. A publication of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Intelligent design proponents, through the Discovery Institute, have employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in their furtherance of their goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents.Seattle Times.

The Discovery Institute has provided material support6News Lawrence: Some question group's move with elections nearing and assisted federal, state and local elected representatives in drafting legislation that would deemphasize or refute evolution in science curricula. The DI has also supported and advised individual parents and local groups who raise the subject with school boards.CSC - Key Resources for Parents and School Board Members During school board meetings in Kansas, Ohio, and Texas, the political and social agenda of the Discovery Institute were used to call into question both the motives of the intelligent design proponents and the validity of their position.Wichita Eagle, \"Scientists Right to Boycott Evolution Hearings,\" March 30, 2005; \"Evolution Hearings Rejected by Scientists,\" April 12, 2005. The Discovery Institute fellows have significant advantages in money, political sophistication, and experience over their opponents in the scientific and educational communities, who do not have the benefit of funding from wealthy benefactors, clerical and technical support staff, and expensive advertising campaigns and extensive political networking., Fred Barton, Lansing State Journal. September 11, 2005Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens By Peter Slevin Washington Post, March 14, 2005Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive By Jodi Wilgoren, New York Times, August 21, 2005 The Discovery Institute's \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign is designed to leave the scientific establishment looking close- minded, appearing as if it is attempting to stifle and suppress new scientific discoveries that challenge the status quo. This is made with the knowledge that it's unlikely many in the public understand advanced biology or can consult the current scientific literature or contact major scientific organizations to verify Discovery Institute claims. This part of the strategy also plays on undercurrents of anti-intellectualism and distrust of science and scientists that can be found in particular segments of American society.\"some hair-splitting that could only look ridiculous to outsider observers.\" What looks to scientists to be a very compelling rebuttal to Dembski's arguments made by Dr. Schneider is portrayed to non-scientists, and especially the public, as \"ridiculous hair-splitting\" Dealing with the Backlash Against Intelligent Design William A. Dembski. Designinference.com, April 14, 2004 There is a noticeable conflict between what intelligent design backers tell the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences.Barbara Forrest. Expert Testimony. Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial transcript, Day 6 (October 5) \"What I am talking about is the essence of intelligent design, and the essence of it is theistic realism as defined by Professor Johnson. Now that stands on its own quite apart from what their motives are. I'm also talking about the definition of intelligent design by Dr. Dembski as the Logos theology of John's Gospel. That stands on its own.\" ... \"Intelligent design, as it is understood by the proponents that we are discussing today, does involve a supernatural creator, and that is my objection. And I am objecting to it as they have defined it, as Professor Johnson has defined intelligent design, and as Dr. Dembski has defined the intelligent design. And both of those are basically religious. They involve the supernatural.\" This is studied and deliberate as advocated by wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson.Phillip Johnson. Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity. July/August 1999.\"...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact.\" The Wedge When speaking to a mainstream audience and to the media, ID proponents cast ID as a secular, scientific theory. But when speaking to what the Wedge Document calls their \"natural constituency, namely (conservative) Christians,\" ID proponents express themselves in unambiguously religious language. This in the belief that they cannot afford to alienate their constituency and major funding sources, virtually all of which are conservative religious organizations and individuals such as Howard Ahmanson. Having written extensively about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says \"When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about the identity of the designer. It is ironic that their political strategy leads them to deny God in the public square more often than Peter did.\"Pennock, Robert T..

New York: Cambridge University Press, (pp. 130 - 148, 2004) The term \"intelligent design\" has become a liability for wedge advocates since the ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.\"In a country in which more than 50 percent of adults consistently tell pollsters that they believe God created humans in their present form within the past 10,000 years, however, there will undoubtedly be a fourth wave that will feature yet another strategy to promote creationism by questioning evolution.

Annas, New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 354:2277-2281 May 25, 2006 Because of the success of the Discovery Institute's public relations campaign to make \"intelligent design\" a household phrase, and the ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District that ID is essentially religious in natureRuling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, Conclusion more people recognize it as the religious concept of creationism. Having come closest to accomplishing getting ID into public school science classes in Kansas and Ohio where they succeeded in getting the State Board of Education to adopt ID lesson plans, intelligent design proponents advocated \"teach the controversy\" as a legally defensible alternative to teaching intelligent design. The Kitzmiller ruling also characterized \"teaching the controversy\" as part of the same religious ploy as presenting intelligent design as an alternative to evolution.\"has the effect of implicitly bolstering alternative religious theories of origin by suggesting that evolution is a problematic theory even in the field of science.\" . . . The effect of Defendants' actions in adopting the curriculum change was to impose a religious view of biological origins into the biology course, in violation of the Establishment Clause.
