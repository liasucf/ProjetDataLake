    "text": "Meta-ethnicity is a relatively recent term (or neologism) occasionally used in academic literature or public discourse on ethnic studies. It describes a level of commonality that is wider (\"meta-\") and more general (i.e., might differ on specifics) than ethnicity, but does not necessarily correspond to (and may actually transcend) nation or nationality. In colloquial discourse, it usually signifies a larger group of related ethnic groups who identify with each other. An early use\u2014possibly the first published in English\u2014was an article in a 1984 USSR Academy of Sciences publication discussing identity in Asia and Africa.Brook, Solomon, and Nikolai Cheboksarov. 1984. \"Metaethnic Identities in Asia and Africa.\" In Ethnocultural Development of African Countries. Moscow: USSR Academy of Sciences. Pp. 49-73. ==Examples of use== Some other examples: * \"Against this dominant view of the nature of the Indian state, Singh argues that India should be seen as an 'ethnic democracy' in which Hinduism works as a meta-ethnicity and in which hegemonic control is exercised over ethnic minorities, particularly those living in the peripheral regions.\" * \"L. Byzov, however, believes that 'there has taken place within the Russian national consciousness one of the most radical changes ever: from a meta-ethnic sense of identity to a strictly ethnic identity' (Byzov 1996, 45).\"Agadjanian, Alexander. 2001. \"Religious pluralism and national identity in Russia.\" MOST Journal on Multicultural Societies, Vol. 2, No. 2 (note 19) * \"Geoffrey Fox, on the other hand, argues that 'Hispanic', with its emphasis on Spanish-language heritage as the foundation of meta-ethnicity, has no implied racial or class agendas and is simply preferred by most immigrants from Latin America.\" ... \"Furthermore, these split-level processes of identity formation\u2014the forging of ethnicity and meta-ethnicity\u2014take place in regional contexts of unequal ethnic control over media and symbol systems.\"Davis, Mike. 1999. \"Magical Urbanism: Latinos Reinvent the US Big City.\" New Left Review I/234, March-April 1999 * Peter Turchin introduces the concept \"metaethnic frontier theory\" in his 2003 book, Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall * \"At the beginning of the new century, Chinese people are living the construction of a metaethnicity of multiple identities.\" ==See also== *Multiethnic society *Panethnicity ==References== ==External links== *Discussion of \"Meta-ethnicity\" on H-Africa Category:Ethnicity Category:Ethnicity in politics Category:Words coined in the 1980s ",
