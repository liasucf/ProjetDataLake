    "text": "Hyperchloremic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis associated with a normal anion gap, a decrease in plasma bicarbonate concentration, and an increase in plasma chloride concentration (see anion gap for a fuller explanation). Although plasma anion gap is normal, this condition is often associated with an increased urine anion gap, due to the kidney's inability to secrete ammonia. ==Causes== In general, the cause of a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a loss of base, either a gastrointestinal loss or a renal loss. *Gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate () ** Severe diarrhea (vomiting will tend to cause hypochloraemic alkalosis) ** Pancreatic fistula with loss of bicarbonate rich pancreatic fluid ** Nasojejunal tube losses in the context of small bowel obstruction and loss of alkaline proximal small bowel secretions ** Chronic laxative abuse *Renal causes ** Proximal renal tubular acidosis with failure of resorption ** Distal renal tubular acidosis with failure of secretion ** Long-term use of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide *Other causes ** Ingestion of ammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or other acidifying salts ** The treatment and recovery phases of diabetic ketoacidosis ** Volume resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline provides a chloride load, so that infusing more than 3-4L can cause acidosis ** Hyperalimentation (i.e., total parenteral nutrition) ==See also== *Anion gap *Metabolic acidosis *Pseudohypoaldosteronism ==References== ==Further reading== * == External links == * * NIH - Renal Tubular Acidosis Category:Acid\u2013base disturbances Category:Electrolyte disturbances ",
