    "text": "The Brazzaville Foundation is an independent, non-profit organisation based in London. Its goal is to develop initiatives, primarily in Africa, in the fields of conflict prevention and resolution, development, the environment and conservation and to bring countries together in peaceful cooperation. It was first registered in the United Kingdom with the Charity Commission in 2015 and granted special consultative status by the UN Economic and Social Council in 2018. == History == The Foundation derives its name from the Brazzaville Protocol official agreed upon on 13 December 1988 in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo. This agreement has been considered critical in the eventual settlement of conflicts in southern Africa, guarantees for the independence of Namibia, the liberation of Nelson Mandela and negotiations leading to the dismantlement of apartheid. Jean-Yves Ollivier, a French businessman with long experience in parallel diplomacy, worked actively in persuading the key figures to meet in Brazzaville as described in the award-winning documentary \u201cPlot for Peace\u201d. He launched the Foundation in 2014 with the goal of maintaining \u201cthe spirit of the Brazzaville Protocol.\" == Actions == The Foundation principal initiatives include the following: === Peace and Reconciliation === The Foundation engages in discussions for peace and reconciliation in Libya. The Foundation helped arrange a summit in Dakar on 11\u201313 May 2018 allowed actors from different Libyan groups to meet and to engage in preliminary dialogues. The Foundation has stated that it intends to organise a \u201cDakar 2\u201d meeting to \"deepen\" the dialogue.\" In an interview with Forbes about the summit, Jean-Yves Ollivier declared that these exchanges were \u201ccomplementary to and supportive of the United Nations, the African Union and others for bringing peace and stability to the country.\u201d === Sustainable Development === The Foundation developed the idea of a Congo Basin Blue Fund in 2015. In the aim of directing financing toward programs that promote a \u2018blue economy\u2019 in the region, emphasizing the sustainable use of river waters and the natural ecosystems of the forest, the proposal for a Congo Basin Blue Fund was formally launched at the UN Climate Change Conference COP 22, in Marrakesh in 2016. At a special meeting in the margins of COP 22, the African Union adopted it as one of Africa\u2019s priority climate change initiatives. In March 2017 at a meeting in Oyo in the Republic of the Congo, ten countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding in which they committed themselves to establishing the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin. In 2018 the United Nations Development Programme prepared a tender for a major feasibility study which will make detailed recommendations on how the Fund will operate and be financed. The Foundation has collaborated with Stop Ivory, by encouraging African countries to commit to the Elephant Protection Initiative with an aim to putting an end to the ivory trade. === The fight against falsified and substandard medicines === The Foundation has worked to raise awareness on the topic of substandard and falsified medicines. This work has resulted in the organization of a side event at the 71st World Health Assembly in partnership with the Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on falsified medicines or medicines of inferior quality, entitled: \u201cMedicines that lie: a deadly public health crisis\u201d. \u201cThe more we looked at it, we felt that this is an issue that simply wasn\u2019t getting the attention it deserved and needed, given the huge human and other consequences that arise from it,\u201d declared Sir David Richmond, CEO of the Foundation, during the conference. == Members == The Foundation\u2019s trustees are Jean-Yves Ollivier, Philip Prettejohn, Olivier Scutt and Nicholas Chance. Its patron is HRH Prince Michael of Kent GCVO.
