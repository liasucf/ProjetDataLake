Located in the larger West Philadelphia district, it stretches north to Larchwood Ave., south to Kingsessing Ave., east to 46th Street, and west to 52nd Street.http://www.phila.gov/phils/Docs/otherinfo/pname1.htmhttp://cedarparkneighbors.org/ Originally outlying farmland, Cedar Park was built between 1850 and 1910 as a streetcar suburbWest Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District, UCHS of Center City. Its development as a suburb accelerated with the installation of horsecars in the 1850s and again with the arrival of electric trolley lines in 1892. It is racially and ethnically diverse, and much of the historic Queen Anne-style architecture still stands. Since about 2000, the neighborhood has been undergoing gentrification stimulated by the University of Pennsylvania's redevelopment plan for West Philadelphia. There is a distinct progressive- politics mien to the neighborhood and a sizable African immigrant community located along and near Baltimore Avenue between 46th and 49th Streets. Cedar Park's residents are predominantly Jamaican/Caribbean and African immigrants, but many are African American (American-born blacks) or white. ==Gallery== image:47th and baltimore.jpg|47th Street and Baltimore Ave image:cedar_park_rooftops.jpg|Queen Anne-style rooftops image:cedar_park_porches.jpg|Houses on Baltimore Ave Image:Row Houses, West Philly.jpg|Rowhouses on 48th Street between Cedar and Walton Streets image:4500 Baltimore Avenue.jpg|SEPTA'S Route 34 trolley in the 4500 block of Baltimore Avenue ==See also== * St. Francis de Sales Church * A-Space (community center) ==External links== * Cedar Park Neighborhood Association * InfoResources West Philadelphia Neighborhood - Cedar Park ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Philadelphia Category:Streetcar suburbs Category:University City, Philadelphia ",
