    "text": "Penetralia is the debut studio album by Hypocrisy, released on October 5, 1992 on Nuclear Blast Records. This is the first of two studio albums with vocalist Masse Broberg, who would later be dismissed as vocalist, with guitarist Peter T\u00e4gtgren assuming the position instead. Hypocrisy's lyrics do not focus on the paranormal and science fiction as would be the case in later albums, instead focussing on more \"traditional\" death metal themes such as Satanism and anti- Christianity. Two music videos would be made for tracks from the record: Impotent God and Left to Rot. The album was later remastered and re-released as a double disk album with their second album Osculum Obscenum in 2013. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Hypocrisy=== * Emperor Magus Caligula \u2013 vocals (tracks 1\u20139), lyrics and logo concept * Peter T\u00e4gtgren \u2212 guitar; drums (tracks 1\u20133, 5\u20138), vocals (track 10), keyboards (track 10), production and mixing *Jonas \u00d6sterberg \u2212 guitar * Mikael Hedlund \u2212 bass ===Guests=== * Lars Sz\u00f6ke \u2212 drums (tracks 4, 9\u201310) * Cover art by Dan Seagrave *M.
