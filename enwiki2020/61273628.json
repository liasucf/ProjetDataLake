    "text": "is an archaeological site containing the ruins of an Incipient J\u014dmon period settlement located in what is now part of the city of Fujinomiya, Shizuoka in the T\u014dkai region of Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2008. ==Overview== The site is located in the former town of Shibakawa, Shizuoka on a hill surrounded by lava flows from Mount Fuji. The site was found to contain the remnants of 14 pit dwellings, arranged around a horseshoe-shaped plaza. The dwellings have a hearth pit at the center, which was found to contain carbonized grains. The excavated remains included some 26,000 items, centering on shards of J\u014dmon period earthenware, hunting tools and stone implements. Although earlier sites have been identified, the \u014cshikubo ruins is the oldest Incipient J\u014dmon period (12,000 to 15,000 years ago) settlement yet discovered with pit dwellings, as other contemporary ruins were typically cave dwellings. The ruins are currently backfilled and buried about 1 to 2 meters below the surface, although the site has a stone marker, information placard and a reconstruction of a faux pit dwelling. ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka) ==References== ==External links== *Fujinomiya City official site Category:J\u014dmon period Category:History of Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Category:Archaeological sites in Japan Category:Historic Sites of Japan ",
