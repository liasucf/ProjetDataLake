A BTh (South African Theological Seminary), a BTh Hons (University of Zululand), an M.A. in Biblical Studies (University of Johannesburg), and a PhD in Systematic Theology (University of Pretoria). Pretorius is a full-time Senior Academic at the South African Theological Seminary,SA Theological Seminary (staff) and a research associate in the department of Systematic Theology at the University of Pretoria.Dogmatics and Christian Ethics Department, University of Pretoria == Research focus == Pretorius's doctoral work encompasses the interaction between science and theology, including integrating evolution and the creative acts of God found in Genesis 1-2.Doctoral Thesis (select pages) He has written several published articles on this relationship (amongst others), in the Academic Journals Verbum et Ecclesia, HTS Theological Studies,Articles by Mark Pretorius listed on the University of Pretoria website and Conspectus.Conspectus: The Journal of the South African Theological Seminary The core of Pretorius's research is a study of sound, specifically cymatics, which he assimilates into his studies of Genesis, and commonly refers to it as a cymatic theology. This model, which postulates that creation was initiated by sound (Gods divinely spoken Word), was initially developed in a paper he presented at an academic meeting in Pretoria (South Africa) in August 2008. The concept of cymatics, on which the model is based, is a well examined and published idea, especially in view of the work of Robert Hooke (1680), Ernst Chladni (1787), Hans Jenny (1967), and currently by John Stuart Reid.Cymascope: Cymascope - John Stuart Reid In the last several years, Pretorius's research has moved towards studying spiritual consciousness and experiences, as attested by his recently published articles. === Readers === A significant part of Pretorius\u2019s academic work, was researching and compiling a wide variety of academic readersReaders, SATS Prospectus (page17) for theological students. These readers are used by students in various institutions around the world, who are in partnership with the South African Theological Seminary. Examples include ISTL (International Seminary of Theology and Leadership) in Switzerland, FIET (Facultad Internacional de Educaci\u00f3n Teol\u00f3gica) in Argentina and EFGBC (Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers Church) in Ethiopia.
