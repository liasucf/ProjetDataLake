It is the second largest town in the principal area and county of Powys and is in the historic county of Brecknockshire. The town has a high proportion of Welsh language-speakers. ==History== The place-name Ystradgynlais, meaning 'vale of the river Cynlais' \u2013 Cynlais may be a personal name, or derive from cyn ('chisel') and glais ('stream') \u2013 is first recorded in 1372. In the 1600s there were only a couple of houses by the church and a pub (now the rectory). In 1801 there were only 993 residents in the town living in only 196 houses. The first documented written evidence of iron working in the area was at Ynyscedwyn and is of a deed of release dated 1729. By 1750 there were seven furnaces in south Wales, one of which was at Ynyscedwyn. The first written evidence of coal mining was at Wauclawdd in 1780. Most of the coal dug up was used in the blast furnaces of the ironworks. By 1790, the full extent of the mineral resources in the valley was better known and it was realised that to exploit these to the full, improved transport would be essential. The greatest increase in the population was between 1821 and 1841. This coincides with the coming of George Crane and the development of the Ynyscedwyn Ironworks. By 1870, the town's industrial development was in decline due to various economic factors, although coal mining carried on in the area with a few light industries. ==Culture== Parc yr Orsedd, Ystradgynlais These remains were built in 1872 to house a planned steel mill.

Ystradgynlais railway station was operational from 1869 to 1923. The A4067 road linking West Cross, Swansea, with Sennybridge ran through the town until the 1970s, when it was diverted onto the bypass that follows the line of the former Swansea Canal. ==Sport== The town is the home of Ystradgynlais F.C. and Ystradgynlais RFC.
