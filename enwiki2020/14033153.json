Over the next thirty years they acquired property totaling . Much of the land was in ruin: erosion from the former cotton fields had robbed the soil of its nutrients. Trash and weeds covered the ground. The Hatchers began working and amending the soil. They filled in the eroded lands, built paths and ponds, and planted thousands of trees, shrubs and flowers. The Hatchers were not wealthy landowners. Limited in resources, but not in creative vision, they raised money for their projects by buying and self- renovating adjacent properties for rental income. They chose to give the Garden to the Spartanburg County Foundation which leaves the garden to the Spartanburg community in perpetuity. == Photos == File:Hatcher_Garden.jpg File:Hatcher Garden 2.jpg ==External links== *Official website *Spartanburg County Foundation ==References== Category:Botanical gardens in South Carolina Category:Spartanburg, South Carolina Category:Protected areas of Spartanburg County, South Carolina ",
