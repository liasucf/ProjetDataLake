Decker was born in Hungary to a German-speaking family, and grew up and made his career in Vienna, where he taught painting as well as working as a portrait and historical artist.

After that, Decker painted portraits in oils, and then from the 1850s also in pastels, having studied the work of Mengs and Liotard in Dresden and been captivated by the medium. Great success in this field soon followed. By 1860, Decker was conducting a private art school and in 1861 became a member of the Vienna K\u00fcnstlerhaus.F\u00fchrer durch die Gem\u00e4lde-galerie Volume 3 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1897), p. 209 Outside the world of art, Decker was an active member of the Vienna Chess Company (Wiener Schachgesellschaft) while Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild was its driving force.

In 1861 he married secondly Josefine Helene von Lucam (1829\u20131914).Heinz Sch\u00f6ny, Wiener K\u00fcnstler-Ahnen: Genealogische Daten u. Ahnenlisten Wiener Maler, Volume 2, Selbstverl. d.
