    "text": "Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, were a Jamaican musical group, one of the best known ska and rocksteady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert is considered a Reggae pioneer on par with Bob Marley . His soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named by Rolling Stone as one of the 100 Greatest Singers. Their 1968 single \"Do the Reggay\" was the first song to use the word \"reggae\", coining the name of the genre and introducing it to a global audience. The Oxford English Dictionary credits Toots and the Maytals in the etymology of the word \"Reggae\". As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, \"The Maytals were unlike anything else ... sensational, raw and dynamic.\"Toots and the Maytals: Reggae Got Soul. BBC Four (documentary). Directed by George Scott. UK. 2011. 59 min. Retrieved 15 December 2016. Toots Hibbert died on 11 September 2020, at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica, due to complications of COVID-19. ==Career== ===Formation and early success=== Frederick \"Toots\" Hibbert, the frontman of the group, was born in May Pen, Clarendon, Jamaica, in 1942, the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir and moved to Kingston in the late 1950s.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , pp. 178\u2013181 ===The Maytals=== First generation of the band Toots and the Maytals arranged by Chris Blackwell to include instrumentalists. The line-up included its four main additional members Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, Hux Brown and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan. The original Maytals band members from Toots and the Maytals performing in Grenoble, France (2017) Hibbert met Henry \"Raleigh\" Gordon and Nathaniel \"Jerry\" Mathias in Kingston in 1962 and formed The Maytals as a vocal trio, a group whose early recordings were incorrectly attributed to The Flames and The Vikings in the UK by Island Records. The first instrumentalist members added to the group included Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, and Paul Douglas.Sherman, Matthew. The Rise of Reggae, and the Influence of Toots and the Maytals. The Dread Library, n.d. Web. 18 September 2016. http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/sherman.html In 1972, the group changed its name from The Maytals to Toots and the Maytals, with \"Toots\" referring to frontman Toots Hibbert, and \"the Maytals\" referring to the group's instrumentalists and background vocalists. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.Mikey T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan.

So everything came under > Toots and the Maytals. And then we hit the road in 1975. ===The 1960s=== The Maytals first had chart success when recording for producer Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd at Studio One. With musical backing from Dodd's house band, the Skatalites, the Maytals' close-harmony gospel singing ensured success, overshadowing Dodd's other up-and-coming vocal group, the Wailers. After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster before recording with Byron Lee in 1966. With Lee, the Maytals won the first-ever Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition in 1966 with their original song \"Bam Bam\" (later covered in a Dancehall style by Sister Nancy, and also by Yellowman in 1982). They went on to win that contest two additional times. The group's musical career was interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was jailed for 18 months for possession of marijuana. He stated that he was not arrested for marijuana, but while bailing out a friend. Hibbert reportedly wrote \"54-46 That's My Number\" about his time in jail. Following Hibbert's release in 1967, the Maytals began working with the Chinese Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which yielded a string of hits throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. These included \"Do the Reggay\", released in 1968, which was the first song to first use the word \"reggae\" and gave the developing genre its name. The Maytals are responsible for some of the biggest hits in reggae history, including \"Pressure Drop,\" \"Sweet And Dandy\" and \"54-46 (That's My Number)\". ===The 1970s=== In 1970 \"Monkey Man\" became the group's first international hit. By 1971, they signed a recording contract with Chris Blackwell's Island Records, become the biggest act in Jamaica, and had become international stars. Blackwell initially concentrated on the UK market, where previous Jamaican acts had had success. The band's albums with Island Records were released through its Dragon Records imprint. In 1972 the group won the Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition for a third time with \"Pomps and Pride\". That year, the group contributed two songs to the soundtrack for The Harder They Come, the 1972 film starring Jimmy Cliff, named as one of Vanity Fairs top 10 soundtracks of all time. The film introduced Jamaican music to American audiences, and the band appears in one of the scenes. After Kong's death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong's former sound engineer, Warrick Lyn. Their re-instated producer Byron Lee renamed them Toots & the Maytals. The group released three best-selling albums produced by Lyn and Blackwell of Island Records, and enjoyed international hits with Funky Kingston in 1973 and Reggae Got Soul in 1975. Music critic Lester Bangs described the album Funky Kingston in Stereo Review as \"perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released\".\"Toots and the Maytals.\" Contemporary Musicians. Encyclopedia.com. 6 Oct. 2016 . Chris Blackwell had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying \"I've known Toots longer than anybody \u2013 much longer than Bob (Bob Marley). Toots is one of the purest human beings I've met in my life, pure almost to a fault.\"Katz, David. \"Toots and the Maytals Live: From Stage to Wax in 24 Hours\". Red Bull Music Academy.

On 1 October 1975, Toots and the Maytals were broadcast live on KMET-FM as they performed at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles. This broadcast was re-mastered and released as an album entitled Sailin' On via Klondike Records.Toots and the Maytals (1975) Sailin' On. Obiterdictum. Web. Retrieved 15 November 2016. Following the release of Reggae Got Soul, Toots & the Maytals were invited to tour as the opening act for the Who during their 1975\u201376 North American tour. Toots and the Maytals' compositions experienced a resurgence of popularity in 1978\u201380 during the reggae punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials covered \"Monkey Man\" on their 1979 debut album and the Clash covered the group's hit \"Pressure Drop\". During this period Toots and the Maytals were also included in the lyrics to Bob Marley & the Wailers' song, \"Punky Reggae Party\": \"The Wailers will be there, the Damned, the Jam, the Clash, the Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too\". ===The 1980s=== ====Guinness Book of World Records==== On 29 September 1980, the band recorded, pressed and distributed a new album, Toots Live, to the record shops all in the space of 24 hours in an attempt to make the Guinness Book of World Records. A live concert was recorded on reels of 2-inch, 24-track analog tape, then rushed by van to sound engineers. After a running order was determined, the record label was quickly designed and sent to the printers. The album masters, labels and the outer covers were then separately sped to the Gedmel factory near Leicester, and the finished product was assembled and delivered to Coventry, where the band was playing the next day, successfully meeting the 24-hour deadline. Due to record label oversight, the achievement was not successfully registered with the Guinness Book of World Records. Island Records' Rob Bell was quoted as saying, \"Unfortunately, the record was not included in the Guinness book, because they required prior notification that the event was going to take place, and no one at Island had informed them of the project!\"Mojo, September 2012, pp. 32\u201333 The record for \"fastest album release\" was not officially held in the Guinness Book of World Records until 28 years later when Vollgas Kompanie claimed the honour in 2008 for recording and releasing their album Live in 24 hours \u2013 matching the time interval in which Toots and the Maytals recorded, pressed and distributed Toots Live in 1980. The group split up after releasing the 1981 album Knockout. In 1982, Toots & the Maytals' \"Beautiful Woman\" reached number one in New Zealand. Hibbert continued to record as a solo artist throughout the 1980s. ===1990s=== Toots and the Maytals with Dave Matthews when performing together in 1998 Members from Toots & the Maytals and Dave Matthews Band when performing together in 1998.

In February 1990 Toots and the Maytals performed on VH1's New Visions World Beat, guest-hosted by Nile Rodgers. The group continued touring and recording successfully, with two appearances at Reggae Sunsplash in the mid-1990s. ===2000s=== Toots and the Maytals with Ronnie Wood (The Rolling Stones) In a 2003 review on NPR's Fresh Air broadcast, critic Milo Miles described the song Pressure Drop as, \"utterly irresistible but utterly mysterious like Louie Louie or Tutti Frutti.

His injuries resulted in a concussion and treatment required six staples in his head. The man who threw the bottle was arrested, and despite Hibbert's pleas for clemency to the judge, was given a six-month sentence. Hibbert's letter to the judge also detailed the extent of his injury: \"I continue to suffer from extreme anxiety, memory loss, headaches, dizziness and most sadly of all, a fear of crowds and performing. I am not able to write songs as I did before or remember the lyrics of songs that I wrote and have performed for decades.\" After his injury, Hibbert canceled all subsequent performances, and the group did not perform live again until 2016.
