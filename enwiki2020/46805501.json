Implementation of the task was assigned to the Ministry of Communication and High Technologies. To realize the project, the Ministry applied to the International Telecommunication Union for the orbital slot allocation process. Concurrently, in August 2009, President Aliyev signed a decree on approval of a state program to establish and develop the space industry in Azerbaijan. In May 2010, the Ministry of Communication and High Technologies reached an agreement with Measat Satellite Systems of Malaysia to lease the geostationary position at the 46\u00b0 East orbital slot, which belongs to the Malaysian government. As a result of the tenders announced on manufacturing and launch of the first Azerbaijani telecommunication satellite, US-based Orbital Sciences Corporation was chosen to construct the satellite, and French company Arianespace was selected to launch it. On May 3, 2010, Presidential Decree ref. 885 established Azercosmos OJSCo with the purpose of implementing the launch, operation, and exploitation of telecommunication satellites for the Republic of Azerbaijan. In October 2017, Azercosmos OJSCo was moved out from under the Ministry of Transport, Communication and High Technologies, and became accountable directly to the Cabinet of Ministers. ==Satellites== Azerspace-1 on the stamp of Azerbaijan, 2013 * Azerspace-1 \u2013 telecommunication satellite; provides radio and television broadcast services, encrypted communication, and high-speed data transmission.
