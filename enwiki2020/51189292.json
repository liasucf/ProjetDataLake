(New York: Jewish Biographical Bureau, 1927), 390. In 1911, he graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Cooper Union\u201cLifschey, Samuel.\u201d Who Was Who in America, vol. IV. (Chicago: Marquis-Who\u2019s Who, 1968), 575. and began his lengthy career as a musician. He was appointed to the position of solo viola with the New York Symphony Orchestra under Walter Damrosch in 1916 and served as a bandmaster with the United States Navy during World War I. Brief stints as principal violist of The Cleveland Orchestra and The Detroit Symphony followed before he was lured to the principal violist position with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925 at the request of Leopold Stokowski.\u201cSamuel Lifschey Retirement.\u201d International Musician 53, no. 9 (March 1955): 23. He remained in that position until his retirement in 1955. He died on September 14, 1961, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Legacy== In addition to Lifschey\u2019s career as an orchestral violist, he was also a prominent viola soloist, the \u201cfirst native-born American to achieve virtuoso rank\u201d on the viola. His March 24, 1919, Aeolian Hall recital with soprano Greta Torpadie is often considered the first solo viola recital in New York City, and he gave the American premieres of numerous works for viola and orchestra, including Paul Hindemith\u2019s Der Scwhanendreher, Isadore Freed\u2019s Rhapsody, Georges H\u00fce\u2019s Th\u00e9me Vari\u00e9, and the Handel-Casadesus Concerto in B Minor. Lifschey was also an important champion of viola music by American composers, and he gave premieres and other important performances of viola works by Ernest Bloch, George Frederick Boyle, Samuel Gardner, Rubin Goldmark, Walter Golde, Henry Holden Huss, and Gustav Strube. Lifschey also contributed greatly with his early publications of viola music, including original pedagogical materials and transcriptions and editions of other works. Published widely by Schirmer, Associated Music Publishers, and Carl Fischer, these works were readily available to American students who were increasingly turning to the viola in the early twentieth century. Lifschey made only a handful of recordings, most notably the gavottes from J. S. Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 6, in 1941, the earliest known commercial recording of any of the suites played on viola.Thomas Tatton. \u201cBach Violoncello Suites Arranged for Viola: Available Editions Annotated.\u201d Journal of the American Viola Society, 72, online issue (Summer 2011): 8.
