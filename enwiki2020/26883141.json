    "text": "The Memphis Wings were a professional ice hockey team in Memphis, Tennessee. They played from 1964\u201367 in the Central Professional Hockey League. As their name suggested, they were a farm team of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings' farm team was originally (in 1963\u201364) in Indianapolis. An arena explosion in November moved the team to become the Cincinnati Wings. The following season the team moved into Memphis. The Wings missed the playoffs in their first two years. In 1966\u201367 they made it into the semi-final, which they lost in seven games to the Omaha Knights. Attendance in the first year was over 130,000, or over 3,700 a game. In 1966\u201367 the attendance was about 71,000, or just over 2,000 a game. In 1967 the team moved to become the Fort Worth Wings. The team was replaced by the Memphis South Stars. ==Season-by- season records== ===Central Hockey League=== Season Games Won Lost Tied Points GoalsFor GoalsAgainst Standing Playoffs 1964\u201365 70 26 35 9 61 243 245 5th out of playoffs 1965\u201366 70 25 33 12 62 200 223 6th out of playoffs 1966\u201367 70 30 32 8 68 230 259 4th Lost Semi Final ==Memphis Wings who played in the NHL== * Gerry Abel * Henry Anderson * Doug Barrie * Norm Beaudin * Danny Belisle * Gary Bergman * Craig Cameron * Bryan Campbell * Dwight Carruthers * Billy Carter * Bob Champoux * Bart Crashley * Joe Daley * Bob Falkenberg * Alex Faulkner * George Gardner * Warren Godfrey * Ron Harris * Chuck Holmes * Brent Hughes * Roger Lafreniere * Real Lemieux * Nick Libett * John MacMillan * Lou Marcon * Gary Marsh * Bert Marshall * Rick McCann * Ab McDonald * Howie Menard * Butch Paul * Jimmy Peters, Jr. * Andre Pronovost * Pat Quinn * Doug Roberts * Dave Rochefort * Glen Sather * Sandy Snow * Irv Spencer * Vic Stasiuk * Bob Wall * Bryan Watson * Jim Watson ==References== Category:Ice hockey teams in Tennessee Category:Central Professional Hockey League teams Category:1964 establishments in Tennessee Category:1967 disestablishments in Tennessee Wings Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1964 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1967 ",
