Le Tr\u00e9port is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in Normandy, France. ==Geography== Le Tr\u00e9port's cliffs, at sunset A small fishing port and light industrial town situated in the Pays de Caux, some northeast of Dieppe at the junction of the D 940, the D 78 and the D 1015 roads. The mouth of the Bresle river meets the English Channel here, in between the high (110 metres) chalk cliffs and the pebbly beach. Le Tr\u00e9port is also a sea-side resort and home to a casino. ==History== The British World War I soldier Arthur Bullock, who was stationed in Le Tr\u00e9port after the Armistice, was captivated by the town, nestling at the bottom of cliffs which could be ascended by 365 steps or by a cliff railway. Bullock recorded in his memoir, 'The sea floor must have been covered by multicoloured sands, for on a clear day, looking from the cliffs straight down into the sea, it seemed that one was looking at a vast abstract canvas of blues, yellows, reds and greens'. While staying there, Bullock also painted a study of a French fisher girl with a basket on her back.Bullock, A S, Gloucestershire Between the Wars: A Memoir, The History Press, 2009, pages 94-95 ==Population== Aerial view of the town A view of the town ==Administration== The current mayor of Le Tr\u00e9port is Laurent Jacques of the PCF political party.
