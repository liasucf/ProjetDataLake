Thorpe missed out on the award in 1969 despite polling well in the Brownlow Medal, finishing the count in 6th position. From that season, until 1972, he represented Victoria at interstate football. For his performance in the 1972 Perth Carnival he earned All Australian selection. Thorpe transferred to Richmond in 1974 and was a member of that season's premiership team, defeating North Melbourne in the grand final. ==External links== * * Category:1948 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Richmond Football Club players Category:Port Melbourne Football Club players Category:Yarraville Football Club players Category:Yarraville Football Club coaches Category:Charles Sutton Medal winners Category:All-Australians (1953\u20131988) Category:Living people ",
