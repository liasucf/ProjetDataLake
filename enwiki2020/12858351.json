    "text": "Genesis), published by the British and Foreign Bible Society. The Ningbo dialect () is a dialect of Wu Chinese, one subdivision of Chinese language. Ningbo dialect is spoken throughout Ningbo and Zhoushan prefectures, in Zhejiang province. ==Intelligibility== Ningbo dialect native speakers generally understand Shanghainese, another dialect of Wu. However, Shanghainese speakers do not always have full understanding of the Ningbo dialect. It is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin Chinese, or any other subdivision of the Chinese language. Ningbo dialect is considered a Yongjiang dialect or Mingzhou dialect (as both terms are synonymous), and is closely related to the Taihu Wu dialects of Zhoushan. In terms of inter- intelligibility between dialects within the Yong-Jiang subgroup, they can be more accurately described as 'accents' () as these dialects are relatively uniform and almost identical to each other aside from pronunciation differences and some minor lexical differences. ==Phonology== ===Initials=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Initial consonants !colspan=2| !Labial !Dental/Alveolar !Alveolo-Palatal !Velar !Glottal |-align=center !colspan=2|Nasal | | | | | |-align=center !rowspan=3|Plosive !tenuis | | | | | |-align=center !aspirated | | | | | |-align=center !voiced | | | | | |-align=center !rowspan=3|Affricate !tenuis | | | | | |-align=center !aspirated | | | | | |-align=center !voiced | | | | | |-align=center !rowspan=2|Fricative !voiceless | | | | | |-align=center !voiced | | | | | |-align=center !colspan=2|Lateral | | | | | |- |} ===Finals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+Vowel nuclei ! rowspan=2| ! colspan=2|Front ! rowspan=2|Central ! rowspan=2|Back |- !Unrounded !Rounded |-align=center !
