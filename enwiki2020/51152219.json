    "text": "Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis (born 15 November 1997) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Belgian First Division A side Club Brugge and the Nigeria national team. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Dennis began his career at Accademia di Abuja, located in Abuja. ===Zorya Luhansk=== In March 2016, Dennis signed with Ukrainian Premier League club Zorya Luhansk. He made his debut in a game against Olimpik Donetsk on 24 July 2016, where he scored the opener in a 3\u20130 victory. Dennis started the season on the bench mostly before being given his UEFA Europa League debut to Feyenoord on 3 November, which ended 1\u20131. After impressing against Feyenoord, he also played in the Ukrainian side's other group stage games, to Fenerbah\u00e7e and Manchester United. Zorya ended up losing 2\u20130 in both matches and ending up getting eliminated from the group after finishing last in their group. On 11 December, Dennis scored his first goal in a 2\u20130 win over Stal Kamianske. His performances attracted both Manchester City as well as an unknown Bundesliga side, who were interested in signing him in the winter transfer window. However, Dennis instead ended up staying with Zorya for the rest of the season, helping them to a third place in the league with his six goals in 22 league appearances. ===Club Brugge=== Club Brugge announced on 30 May 2017 that they had signed Dennis on a four-year-deal for a fee of \u20ac1.2 million. He was given the number 42 jersey shirt. Dennis started the season extremely well, scoring five goals in six matches, including one on his debut on 26 July 2017 to \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, a 3\u20133 draw and a brace three days later in the league over Lokeren, which finished in a 4\u20130 victory. On 1 October 2019, Dennis scored twice in a 2\u20132 draw at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium against Real Madrid in the group stage of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League season. ==International career== Dennis has represented Nigeria on under-15 and under-23 level. Dennis made his debut for the senior team on 10 September 2019 in a 2\u20132 friendly draw to Ukraine, coming on as a 82nd-minute substitute for Samuel Chukwueze. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=2|Zorya Luhansk |2016\u201317 |Ukrainian Premier League |22||6||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||26||6 |- !colspan=2|Total !22!!6!!1!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!|3!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!26!!6 |- |rowspan=4|Club Brugge |2017\u201318 |rowspan=3|Belgian First Division A |30||7||4||4||colspan=2|\u2014||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||38||12 |- |2018\u201319 |26||7||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||0||colspan=2|\u2014||32||7 |- |2019\u201320 |15||5||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||10||3||colspan=2|\u2014||25||8 |- !colspan=2|Total !71||19||6||4||colspan=2|\u2014||19||4||colspan=2|\u2014||96||27 |- !colspan=3|Total !93!!25!!7!!4!!colspan=2|\u2014!!22!!4!!colspan=2|\u2014!!122!!33 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |Nigeria |2019||2||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!2!!0 |} ==Honours== Club Brugge *Belgian First Division A: 2017\u201318, runner-up: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Nigerian footballers Category:Nigeria international footballers Category:Nigerian expatriate footballers Category:FC Zorya Luhansk players Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Club Brugge KV players Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Belgium ",
