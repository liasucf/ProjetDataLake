Scott, The American Mineralogist, (1971), 56, 355 Gallium hydroxide is amphoteric. In strongly acidic conditions, the gallium ion, Ga3+ is formed. In strongly basic conditions, Ga(OH)4\u2212 is formed. Salts of Ga(OH)4\u2212 are sometimes called gallates. ==References== Category:Hydroxides Category:Gallium compounds ",
