    "text": "Mourning Sun, released in November 2005, is the fifth studio album (although it is fourth 'official' studio album)[ Allmusic review] by Fields of the Nephilim. Vocalist Carl McCoy is the only original band member to be featured on this album. McCoy along with John \"Capachino\" Carter (original Nefilim collaborator) spent eighteen months recording new demos in McCoy's mobile recording studio, dubbed \"The Ice Cage\" which took them to various places, including Norway. According to McCoy, Ice Cage sessions generated enough material for a double album, yet it was ultimately decided to narrow the track listing down to one disc. While McCoy has acknowledged that additional musicians were recruited for the writing and recording process,\"The people who worked on the demos of \"Mourning Sun\" are the same musicians who played on the final recordings. The tracks were very long at the beginning, and required important work on their structures and arrangements. In themselves, these things could be defended, no problem at all, but to integrate them into an album would have been too complicated.\" In D-Side, Issue 31, November\u2013December 2005, interviewed by Emmanuel Hennequin he has not disclosed their identities nor admitted whether they are included in the band's touring lineup; the only identified persons involved in the recording process to date are John \"Capachino\" Carter (a bass player who also worked with McCoy on Zoon demos in the beginning of 1990's) and McCoy's daughters Scarlett and Eden on backing vocals for the title track. McCoy has admitted to having applied preprogrammed drums on some of the tracks, stressing at the same time that most of the drum parts \"were created by a real human being - Carter.\"\"Some of the percussion, situated at the bottom of the mix, was indeed programmed. Other parts were played on line. But for the most part, the rhythmic ones were created by a real human being\", from the interview by Emmanuel Hennequin in D-Side magazine, Issue 31, November\u2013December 2005 ==Track listing== #\"Shroud (Exordium)\" \u2013 5:44 #\"Straight to the Light\" \u2013 6:24 #\"New Gold Dawn\" \u2013 7:58 #\"Requiem (Le Veilleur Silencieux)\" \u2013 7:21 #\"Xiberia (Seasons in the Ice Cage)\" \u2013 7:33 #\"She\" \u2013 9:26 #\"Mourning Sun\" \u2013 10:35 #\"In the Year 2525\" - 9:28 (bonus item available only on the limited edition of the album) ==Reception== Reception to the new album was generally positive, with even the NME listing no less than six of the album's tracks amongst their Top 10 for the band's best songs to date. ==Personnel== * Carl McCoy - vocals, keys, producer * John \"Capachino\" Carter - bass guitar, guitars, drums, keys & backing vocals * Scarlett McCoy - backing vocals on \"Mourning Sun\" * Eden McCoy - backing vocals on \"Mourning Sun\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fields of the Nephilim albums Category:2005 albums Category:SPV/Steamhammer albums ",
