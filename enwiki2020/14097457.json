    "text": "Muscle Shoals High School is the sole public secondary education institution in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. MSHS was recently awarded the Blue Ribbon Lighthouse Award for Excellence. == Academics == Based on the Alabama Reading and Math Test scores, the system has consistently placed among the top 10 school districts in one or more areas in most grade levels. Another tradition is the parental support of the school's programs with a majority of the parents being involved in one or more programs throughout the year. Still, another tradition is the large number of students who pursue post-secondary educational programs each year. It is not uncommon for this number to be at or above 90%.Muscle Shoals Board of Education ==Band== The Muscle Shoals High School band program was founded in 1965 by Charles Stratford, graduate of Louisiana State University. The marching band has received Superior ratings every year since 1966, along with dozens of First Place, Best in Class, and Grand Champion awards. In 2001, they traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to be the first band from Alabama to compete in Bands of America (BOA). Since then, the band has been Class A Champions in Atlanta four times (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005). At the Alabama Bandmasters Association State Festival, the Muscle Shoals High School Symphonic Band has earned Superiors for the past 13 consecutive years. In 2005, the band traveled to Orlando, Florida to compete in the All-Star Music Festival. There they were awarded Grand Champions in Parade Band, Concert Band, Concert Percussion, and Jazz Band. In 2009, they returned to the Orlando All-Star Music Festival to receive once again the Grand Champion title in Concert Band, Concert Percussion, and Jazz Band. During the 2007\u201308 season, the marching band won the Grand Champion trophy at the Dixie Pride Marching Classic and the Vanderbilt Marching Invitational and won 3rd Place in Class A at the Bands of America Atlanta Super Regional. In 2012 the band lost two of their directors, Terry Ownby and Pat Stegall. Terry resigned to take the band directors position at Wallace State and Pat retired and took a position at the University of North Alabama. However, they hired two new directors. Will Campbell and Nathan Haskew became part of the family of music at MSHS. The marching band was awarded two Grand Champion awards and 3rd place in The Heart of Dixie competition with their show \"The Piano Lesson\". The concert band made superior ratings at MPAs and went to Disney World to compete. They also were delighted to have the opportunity to rename the MSHS auditorium in honor of former band director Charles R. Stratford at their Spring Concert. ===Percussion=== The Muscle Shoals High School Drumline has earned the reputation as one of the finest programs in Alabama and the Southeast. They consistently earn Superior Ratings, 1st Place, and Grand Champion awards. In 2008, after many years of in-state competition, they enrolled in various Winter Guard International (WGI) and Southeastern Color Guard Circuit (SCGC) events. With their show Samson & Delilah, featuring \"Bachanalle\", the ensemble placed 1st at the 2008 SCGC Championships in the Scholastic Concert Open class, and at the WGI World Championships they placed third in the nation in Scholastic Concert Open. In 2009, the ensemble competed again in WGI and SCGC with their show, \"Carmen\". They placed first in Scholastic Concert Open class, both in Winter Guard International and Southeastern Color Guard Circuit. Their 2010 show was entitled \"Letters From War\". They were awarded the silver medal at the Scholastic Concert World Class WGI Competition and first in the SCGC. In 2013 their show was called \"School for Scandal\".
