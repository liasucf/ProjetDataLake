    "text": "Mount Hungabee (left) and Opabin Pass Mount Hungabee, officially Hungabee Mountain, is a mountain located on the boundaries of Banff National Park and Yoho National Park on the Continental Divide at the head of Paradise Valley. The peak was named in 1894 by Samuel Allen after the Stoney Indian (also known as Nakoda) word for \"chieftain\" as the mountain is higher than its neighbouring peaks. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway (#93) in the upper Bow Valley. Mt. Hungabee was first climbed in 1903 by H.C. Parker who was guided by Hans Kaufmann and Christian Kaufmann. == Routes == The normal climbing route is via the west ridge (III 5.4) which features route finding challenges. Early summer is not recommended due to avalanche hazard from snow on the NW face. ==Geology== Mount Hungabee is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Hungabee is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 C with wind chill factors below \u221230 C. == See also == * List of peaks on the British Columbia-Alberta border ==Further reading== * Chic Scott, Pushing the Limits: The Story of Canadian Mountaineering, P 175 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Yoho National Park Category:Borders of British Columbia Category:Borders of Alberta Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Great Divide of North America ",
