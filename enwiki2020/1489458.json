On 6 May 2012 the regional referendums of Sardinia took place regarding the abolition of certain provinces and a variety of other matters. The suggestion of reforming or abolishing certain provinces in Sardinia was approved by the Regional Council of Sardinia on 24 May 2012.

It later formed a new administrative body. ==Geography== The Province of Medio Campidano is on the west side of the Island of Sardinia, with a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. To the north is the Province of Oristano, to the east the Province of Cagliari and to the south, the Provinces of Carbonia-Iglesias and Cagliari. The total area of Medio Campidano is , some 6.3% of the whole island. It is divided into 28 municipalities. The capitals are Sanluri in the east and Villacidro in the south. The environment is diverse, with mountains, hills, plains and coastline. The province is one of the least populated and most unspoilt areas of the island and has earned the name, the \"Green Province\". The mining industry began to develop in the province in the nineteenth century due to the large lead, copper and silver reserves, but the industry became uneconomical after World War II and all that now remains is the industrial heritage. In the more hilly districts, olives and grapes are grown and Sardinia is known for the breeding of sheep. The Campidano plain is used for cropping and produces rice, maize and sorghum. ==Government== ===List of Presidents of the Province of Medio Campidano=== {|class=\"wikitable\" ! class=unsortable| !
