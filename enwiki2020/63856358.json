    "text": "John Barlab\u00e1ssy de Csesztve (; died 1509) was a Hungarian nobleman in the second half of the 15th century. He was castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (present- day Alba Iulia, Romania). ==Family== John (II) was born into the Barlab\u00e1ssy (also Barlab\u00e1si or Barab\u00e1si) noble family, which possessed landholdings in northeastern Hungary (especially Bereg County). His parents were John (I) and his second wife, Veronica Harangl\u00e1bi (widow of Emeric Gy\u00f6rgyfalvi). He had an elder brother, Michael I. Their mother came from a wealthy Transylvanian noble family. As a dowry, John, Sr. acquired portions in Kolozs and K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 counties \u2013 including M\u00f3cs (Mociu) \u2013, and the Barlab\u00e1ssy family gradually became part of the Transylvanian elite in the second half of the 15th century. It is possible that John, Jr. married an unidentified noblewoman from the wealthy Erd\u00e9lyi de Somker\u00e9k family. Their marriage produced three children: the eldest one John III was referred to as \"homo regius\" (the king's vassal) during the reign of Vladislaus II of Hungary. Leonard I was an influential vice-voivode and patron of arts in Transylvania at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. His youngest natural son was Michael II, vice-chamberlain of the salt chamber of Sz\u00e9k (Sic) in 1512. John also adopted an orphan, John L\u00e1szai, who entered ecclesiastical career and later erected a Renaissance-style chapel in the St. Michael's Cathedral of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. ==Career and possessions== Michael and John acquired Csesztve (today part of Ocna Mure\u0219 town in Romania) and the surrounding lands by the 1450s. They built a country-house there, which became the permanent residence of the Barlab\u00e1ssys. The brothers and their descendants used the prefix \"de Chezthwe\" (and various other write forms) thereafter. The Csesztve lordship laid along an important trade route near the river Maros (Mure\u0219) and the salt mines of Maros\u00fajv\u00e1r (Ocna Mure\u0219). In the subsequent years, they also bought Csombord (Ciumbrud), V\u00e1radja (Oarda), Lomfalva and Marosszentkir\u00e1ly (S\u00e2ncraiu de Mure\u0219). John Barlab\u00e1ssy acted as representative and lawyer of John Ger\u00e9b in a lawsuit over the property of B\u00e1lv\u00e1nyos Castle (today ruins near Ungura\u0219) on 22 May 1461. Consequently, he was familiaris of the influential Ger\u00e9b family by that time. Barlab\u00e1ssy did not join the Transylvanian rebellion against King Matthias Corvinus in 1467, unlike his many relatives (for instance, his aunt Julia Barlab\u00e1ssy). For his loyalty, the monarch appointed him castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, an important stronghold in the province, which increased his political influence in the surrounding region. In the 1470s, Barlab\u00e1ssy entered the service of Stephen B\u00e1thory, a respected military general and Voivode of Transylvania. He participated in various campaigns and counter-attacks in response to the Ottoman incursions, which constantly harassed and threatened the province of Transylvania. Barlab\u00e1ssy also fought in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October 1479, belonging to the banderium of Stephen B\u00e1thory. In the 1480s and 1490s, Barlab\u00e1ssy was frequently styled as \"homo regius\" (i.e. king's vassal), when acted as pristaldus (royal commissioner or \"bailiff\") in several possession matters on behalf of king Matthias Corvinus, then Vladislaus II. As castellan of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Barlab\u00e1ssy was a dedicated patron of arts and sciences. He and his son, Leonard financially supported a Humanist scholar circle, based in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which helped to spread Renaissance arts, science and architecture throughout Transylvania. He also supported the Roman Catholic Church; he bequeathed his landholdings at V\u00e1radja and Lomfalva and his mill and its customs accessories at Sebes to the cathedral chapter of Transylvania in 1501. Barlab\u00e1ssy made his last will and testament in 1508. He died in the next year at a relatively old age by the standard of his time, when some of his grandchildren already reached adulthood. As a result, some contemporary records in the late stages of his life referred to him as \"John Barlab\u00e1ssy the Old\" () to distinguish him from his namesake son and grandson. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1430s births Category:1509 deaths Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people John 02 ",
