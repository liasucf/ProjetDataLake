    "text": "Resolven Rugby Football Club are a Welsh rugby union club based in Resolven in Wales and are a feeder club for the Ospreys. == History == Rugby was supposedly introduced to Resolven by two visiting engineers; Charlie Thomas and Alf Morgan, in 1885. The Club first played at Tan-y- Rhiw, then the Brick Field, then in 1898 to Sardis field until moving again, this time to the Farmers Field. Between the World Wars rugby was played on the Drehir ground on which the club had managed to acquire a changing room and grandstand. During the Second World War the Drehir ground was used by the UK government to build a munitions factory. In 1945 this left Resolven RFC in the position of being members of the WRU but without a playing field. On 31 October 1946 a new ground at Tan-y-Rhiw field was opened on which Resolven play rugby to this day. Capt. J.N. Vaughan granted the use of the field and on 14 October 1954 the Vaughan family of Rheola donated the freehold of the property to Resolven Rugby Football Club. The field was renamed the Vaughan Rugby Ground in honour of their benefactor. In May 2006 Resolven RFC were one of the 13 'Rebel' clubs who brought a vote of no confidence against the WRU, which centered on financing and the handling of former coach Mike Ruddock's departure. The vote failed heavily with only 20 votes for the motion and over 300 against.Welsh clubs give backing to Union - BBC Sports, sourced 16 August 2007 Heading into the 2010/2011 season Resolven celebrate their 125th Anniversary.
