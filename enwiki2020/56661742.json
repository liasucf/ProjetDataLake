    "text": "Bethmaus, or Beth Ma\u02bfon () (), was a Jewish village during the late Second Temple and Mishnaic periods, and which was already a ruin (Tell Ma\u02bf\u016bn) when Kitchener visited the site in 1877.Conder & Kitchener (1881), p. 371. Tell Ma\u02bf\u016bn is shown on the 1880 Survey of Western Palestine map, sheet no. 6.Cf. Conder, C.R. (1879), p. 181 It was situated upon the hill, directly north-west of the old city of Tiberias, at a distance of one biblical mile,Ishtori Haparchi (2007), p. 56, who makes mention of the village Ma\u02bfon, which he describes as being \"within a Sabbath day's journey to the west of Tiberias.\" The editor of the volume has identified the site as Beth Ma\u02bfon, mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud, Sotah 1:8, and Baba Metziah 7:1. Ishtori Haparhi had mistaken this Ma\u02bfon in Galilee for being the one where David and his men took refuge from King Saul, in I Samuel 23:24. rising to an elevation of above sea- level. It is now incorporated within the modern city bounds of Upper Tiberias. The Midrash (Genesis Rabba \u00a7 85:7) says of the village, \"Beth Ma\u02bfon, they ascend to it from Tiberias, but they go down to it from Kefar Shobtai.\"Klein, S. (1939), p. 16Neubauer, A. (1868), p. 218 The Jerusalem Talmud, citing a variant account, says that they would go down to Beth Ma\u02bfon from its broad place.Original: palo\u1e6detha = perhaps der. of \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 (\"a broad place\"). Above Bethmaus there was an extensive plateau. See Jerusalem Talmud, Sotah 1:8 (7a) ==History== Josephus, the Jewish general turned historian, mentions that when he was put in charge of the public affairs of Galilee by the people of Jerusalem during the war with Rome, he moved with two of his fellow-legates who were priests of Aaron's lineage from Sepphoris to the village Bethmaus (henceforth: Beth Ma\u02bfon), a village situated four furlongs (stadia) distant from Tiberias.Josephus, Vita \u00a7 12, which happens to be the equivalent of a biblical mile. It was at Beth Ma\u02bfon that Josephus met Justus of Tiberias. There, they convened a meeting with the principal persons of Tiberias, to discuss a plan to demolish a house built by Herod the Tetrarch in Tiberias, and which had the figures of living creatures in it (contrary to Jewish law), but to restore the royal furniture of that house, consisting of candlesticks made of Corinthian brass, and of royal tables, and of a great quantity of uncoined silver, to the king. However, when Josephus took leave of Beth Ma\u02bfon and went into Upper Galilee, before Josephus and the senate of Tiberias could carry out their schemes, certain mariners and poor people of Galilee had plundered the house built by Herod of its effects, and taken away the spoils. In the early 2nd-century CE, following the Bar Kokhba revolt, Beth Ma\u02bfon became the residence of one of the priestly clans known as \u1e24uppah. Around this time, representatives of the twenty-four priestly wards moved and settled in the Galilee.Klein, S. (1939), p. 164 (s.v. \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05df); Klein, S. (1945), p. 65Rosenfeld, B. (1998), p. 82 [26] In the 20th-century, three stone inscriptions were discovered bearing the names of the priestly wards, their order and the name of the locality to which they had moved after the destruction of the Second Temple: In 1920, a stone inscription was found in Ashkelon showing a partial list of the priestly wards; in 1962 three small fragments of one Hebrew stone inscription bearing the partial names of places associated with the priestly courses (the rest of which had been reconstructed) were found in Caesarea Maritima, dated to the third-fourth centuries;Avi-Yonah, M. (1962), pp. 137\u2013139Avi-Yonah, M. (1964), pp. 24\u201328 in 1970 a stone inscription was found on a partially buried column in a mosque, in the Yemeni village of Bayt al-\u1e24a\u1e0dir, showing ten names of the priestly wards and their respective towns and villages. The Yemeni inscription is the longest roster of names of this sort ever discovered unto this day, and mentions the priestly course in Beth Ma\u02bfon. The seventh-century poet, Eleazar ben Killir, echoing the same tradition, also wrote a liturgical poem detailing the 24-priestly wards and their places of residence.Poem entitled, Lamentation for the 9th of Ab, composed in twenty-four stanzas, and the last line of each stanza contains the name of the village where each priestly family lived. Historian and geographer, Samuel Klein (1886\u20131940), thinks that Killir's poem proves the prevalence of this custom of commemorating the courses in the synagogues of Ere\u1e93 Israel.Klein, S. (1909); Enrico Tuccinardi, Nazareth, the Caesarea Inscription, and the hand of God, (translated from the French by Ren\u00e9 Salm), Academia, pp. 6\u20137 The purpose of composing these lists was to keep in living memory the identities and traditions of each priestly family, in hopes that the Temple would be quickly rebuilt.Enrico Tuccinardi, Nazareth, the Caesarea Inscription, and the hand of God, (translated from the French by Ren\u00e9 Salm), Academia, p. 7 In extant Turkish documents dating to May 1566, the Ottoman ruler, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, ordered that water be drawn from Beth Ma\u02bfon and brought to Tiberias,Heyd, U. (1966), p. 199 the purpose of which is not now known, although thought to have been for agricultural crops. By April 1566, when the work had not yet been completed and the workers (under Don Joseph Nasi) demanded more money from the Sultan to complete the project, the Sultan refused to set aside more money for the project. Below Beth Ma\u02bfon, between the ruins of the ancient village and Tiberias, are found two natural springs.
