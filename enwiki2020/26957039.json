    "text": "Parma Associazione Calcio had a moderately strong season in 2000\u201301, managing to qualify for the UEFA Champions League, but also losing the final of Coppa Italia and dropping out of the UEFA Cup too early for the board's liking, ultimately leading to coach Alberto Malesani being let go at the end of the season. 2000\u201301 also marked the first time in four years that Parma had to make do without star striker Hern\u00e1n Crespo, who left for 2000 champions Lazio in the early summer. S\u00e9rgio Con\u00e7eic\u00e3o and Mat\u00edas Almeyda arrived from the Rome club as part of the transfer, but as they were midfielders Parma was staring at a potential striking crisis. Marco Di Vaio hit the back of the net 15 times, but M\u00e1rcio Amoroso continued his miserable display in the Parma shirt, which saw him offloaded to Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2001. Still young, superstar goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon played out his final season with the club, along with defender Lilian Thuram. Both were sold to Juventus in the summer, and their absence was clearly felt in the 2001\u201302 season. 2001 remains the last time Parma qualified for the Champions League. ==Players== ===Squad information=== :Squad at end of season ===Left club during season=== ==Transfers== ===In=== * Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 - Zaragoza, \u20ac25,000,000 * Roberto Sensini - Lazio, October * Stephen Appiah - Udinese * Patrick M'Boma - Cagliari * Sabri Lamouchi - Monaco * S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o - Lazio, part-exchange * J\u00fanior - Palmeiras * Johan Micoud - Bordeaux * Emiliano Bonazzoli - Brescia * Mat\u00edas Almeyda - Lazio, part-exchange * Gianluca Falsini - Hellas Verona ===Out=== * Mario Stani\u0107 - Chelsea, 28 June, \u20ac8,960,000Equal to \u00a35,600,000 * Dino Baggio - Lazio, October, \u20ac5,164,572.72Equal to 10 billion lire * Hern\u00e1n Crespo - Lazio, \u20ac25,696,000Equal to \u00a316,000,000 plus Mat\u00edas Almeyda and S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (transfer valued at \u20ac56,210,000Equal to \u00a335,000,000) * Ariel Ortega - River Plate, \u20ac5,681,029.99Equal to 11 billion lireParma received a further \u20ac2,292,000 (equal to $2,500,000) from a sell-on clause when Ortega was sold to Fenerbah\u00e7e in May 2002. * Roberto Breda - Genoa * Luigi Apolloni - Hellas Verona * Pietro Strada - Cosenza * Ousmane Dabo - Monaco * Saliou Lassissi - Fiorentina * Paolo Vanoli - Fiorentina * Johan Walem - Udinese * Michele Serena - Internazionale ====Loans out==== * Davide Zoboli - Benevento * Raffaele Longo - Vicenza * Emiliano Bonazzoli - Hellas Verona ==Competitions== ===Overall=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center; width:730px; |- ! style=text-align:center; width:150px; | Competition ! style=text-align:center; width:100px; | Started round ! style=text-align:center; width:100px; | Current position ! style=text-align:center; width:100px; | Final position ! style=text-align:center; width:150px; | First match ! style=text- align:center; width:140px; | Last match |- | style=text-align:left; | Serie A | Matchday 1 | \u2014 | 4th | 1 October 2000 | 17 June 2001 |- | style=text- align:left; | Coppa Italia | Round of 16 | \u2014 | style=background:#B2BEB5;|Runners-up | 17 September 2000 | 13 June 2001 |- | style=text-align:left; | UEFA Cup | First round | \u2014 | Fourth round | 14 September 2000 | 22 February 2001 |} Last updated: 17 June 2001 ===Serie A=== ====League table==== ====Results summary==== ====Results by round==== ====Matches==== ===Coppa Italia=== ====Round of 16==== ====Quarter-finals==== ====Semi-finals==== ====Final==== ===UEFA Cup=== ====First round==== ====Second round==== ====Third round==== ====Fourth round==== ==Statistics== ===Goalscorers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: center;\" |- !width=60|Place !width=60|Position !width=60|Nation !width=60|Number !width=150|Name !width=80|Serie A !width=80|Coppa Italia !width=80|UEFA Cup !width=80|Total |- |1 ||FW || || ||Marco Di Vaio || 15 || 3 || 2 || 20 |- |2 ||FW || || ||M\u00e1rcio Amoroso || 7 || 4 || 3 || 14 |- |3 ||FW || || ||Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 || 8 || 2 || 2 || 12 |- |4 ||MF || || ||S\u00e9rgio Con\u00e7eic\u00e3o || 5 || 0 || 2 || 7 |- |= ||MF || || ||Johan Micoud || 4 || 2 || 1 || 7 |- |6 ||FW || || ||Patrick Mboma || 5 || 0 || 1 || 6 |- |7 ||MF || || ||Sabri Lamouchi || 3 || 0 || 0 || 3 |- |= ||MF || || ||J\u00fanior || 3 || 0 || 0 || 3 |- |= ||MF || || ||Johnnier Monta\u00f1o || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 |- |10 ||FW || || ||Emiliano Bonazzoli || 0 || 0 || 2 || 2 |- |= ||MF || || ||Stephen Appiah || 0 || 1 || 1 || 2 |- |12||DF || || ||Stefano Torrisi || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 |- |= || || || ||Own Goal || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 |- |= ||DF|| || ||Luigi Sartor || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 |- |colspan=\"4\"| |TOTALS |51 || 15 || 16 || 82 |} ==References== Category:Parma Calcio 1913 seasons Parma ",
