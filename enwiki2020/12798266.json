    "text": "Polka-style medleys of cover songs are a distinguishing part of American musician, satirist, parodist, and songwriter \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's catalog. Twelve of his fourteen albums contain them; his self-titled debut and Even Worse omit them. The medleys are composed of various popular songs, each one reinterpreted as a polka (generally an instrumentation of accordion, banjo, tuba, clarinet, and muted brass interspersed with sound effects) with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect and profane lyrics are covered with cartoon sound effects. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was \"...the way God intended.\" Yankovic said that the medleys were something he did \"even before I had a record deal\" in live performances, and that many of the songs are included due to not receiving a full parody version - \"if there\u2019s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can\u2019t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it\u2019ll end up in the polka medley.\" Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, \"At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.\" Yankovic has always asked permission from every artist whose songs compose a medley due to royalties issues. He acknowledged some influence of Spike Jones in the medleys, such as the sound effects. Three of Yankovic's polka medleys\"Hooked on Polkas\", \"Polka Power!\", and \"The Hamilton Polka\"have been released as singles (either in international markets or domestically). \"Polka Your Eyes Out\" and \"Polkas on 45\" were also the only polkas to appear on a greatest hits album and \"Polka Face\" is the only polka to have an official video released for it. ==\"Polkas on 45\"== \"Polkas on 45\" is Yankovic's first polka medley. It appears on his second album, In 3-D. This and \"The Hot Rocks Polka\" are Yankovic's only polka medleys to focus on popular rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s rather than contemporary songs, though \"Polkas on 45\" includes some of the latter (ex:Talking Heads and The Police). The song title is a take on the medley-releasing novelty band Stars on 45 and their self-titled 1981 single. The following songs are contained in the medley: *\"Beer Barrel Polka\" by Jarom\u00edr Vejvoda *\"Jocko Homo\" by Devo *\"Smoke on the Water\" by Deep Purple *\"Sex (I'm A...)\" by Berlin *\"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles *\"L.A.

It appeared on his third album, Dare to Be Stupid. The song was released as a single in Japan.
