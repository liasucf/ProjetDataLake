    "text": "The gens Latinia was a minor family at ancient Rome, which flourished during Imperial times. ==Origin== The nomen Latinius seems to imply that the ancestors of the gens were Latins, and perhaps were once known by the surname of Latinus, designating them as such. But one of the earliest records of the family is an inscription on an Etruscan cinerary urn, dating from the third century BC, which reads, , that is, \"Aulus Latinius, son of Velsia\". So the name may originally have been applied to an Etruscan family of Latin origin. ==Members== * Aulus Latinius Velsial natus, from an Etruscan cinerary urn, dating to the third century BC.Metropolitan Museum of Art. * Latinius Pandus, propraetor of Moesia during the reign of Tiberius, was sent to Thrace to secure the release of Cotys, the Thracian king, from his uncle, Rhescuporis, in AD 19.
