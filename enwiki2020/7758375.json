Protecting of shoreline on Lake Michigan, Newport is Wisconsin's only wilderness-designated state park. In 2017, the International Dark-Sky Association named Newport a Dark-sky preserve.Lee Bergquist. \"Newport State Park designated as Wisconsin's first 'dark sky' park/\". Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 7, 2017. The park is open year-round and can be accessed via Wisconsin state highway 42. ==Air pollution monitor== The only public air pollution monitor in the county is located in Newport State Park.Photo of the monitoring station on page 128 of Most air pollution reaching the station comes from outside the county. This map shows how air travels to the monitoring station. Because the station is near the shore, only the red lines (which show the lower air currents) meaningfully depict the path of ozone to the monitor. As shown on the map, these lower air currents carry polluted air from major urban areas. Farther inland, however, the air from higher up mixes more, so all color lines are significant when tracing the path of air pollution further inland, and these higher air currents (shown in green and blue) blow in from cleaner, mostly rural areas. == Gallery == ==See also== ==References== ==Bibliography== ==External links== *Newport State Park website Category:Protected areas of Door County, Wisconsin Category:State parks of Wisconsin Category:Protected areas established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Wisconsin ",
