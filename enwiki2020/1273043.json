    "text": "\"American Tune\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. It was the third single from his third studio album, There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973), released on Columbia Records. The song, a meditation on the American experience, is based on the melody of the hymn \"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded\". The song reached number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100.Whitburn, Joel (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications). ==Lyrics== In an interview with Tom Moon in 2011, Paul Simon was asked about political references in his songs, and he said: \"I don\u2019t write overtly political songs, although American Tune comes pretty close, as it was written just after Nixon was elected.\" The lyrics offer a perspective on the American experience; there are references to struggle, weariness, hard work, confusion, and homesickness. The bridge conveys a dream of death and of the Statue of Liberty \"sailing away to sea\". The song ends with an assertion that \"you can't be forever blessed\" before the lyrics return to the idea of work, tiredness, and resignation. Billboard described it as a \"discourse on inner security while being far from home.\" ==Music== The tune is based on a melody line from the hymnal \"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded\" (German: \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\" by Paul Gerhardt), itself a reworking of an earlier secular song, \"Mein G'm\u00fct ist mir verwirret,\" composed by Hans Leo Hassler. The melody used for \"American Tune\" can also be heard quite distinctly in Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion, part 1, number 21 and number 23 and in part 2, number 54. Additionally, the melody line is plainly heard in the opening of Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings in C major, Op. 48 which was composed in 1880. ==Personnel== * Paul Simon - vocals, 6 & 12-string acoustic guitars * Bob James - keyboards, piano, harmonium * Bob Cranshaw - bass guitar * Grady Tate - drums * Del Newman - string arrangement ==Live performances== Eventually it became a concert favorite, both for Simon and in reunion concerts with Simon's former singing partner, Art Garfunkel. The song appears on several of Simon's solo live albums and on Simon and Garfunkel's post- breakup live albums, most famously The Concert in Central Park.

It is alluded to in the lyrics of \"Independence Day\" by Ferron on her album, Driver: \"There's a Paul Simon song that just tears me apart... about the Statue of Liberty and hole in a heart.\" Lyrics from the song are also used at the beginning of Book 2 of Stephen King's The Stand.
