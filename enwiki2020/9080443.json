    "text": "Miniques Lagoon Mi\u00f1iques is a massive volcanic complex containing a large number of craters, lava domes and flows, located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. Located south of Volc\u00e1n Chiliques and west of Cord\u00f3n Puntas Negras, it is part of a frequently visited attraction conformed by the high plain lagoons Laguna Miscanti, Laguna Mi\u00f1iques and the Cerro Miscanti volcano. == Mountain == Mi\u00f1iques has two summits, a lower northern summit which reaches elevation and a higher southern one which is high. The mountain features two crater lakes, one at and the other at elevation on the southeastern and western side of the northern summit, respectively. A set of well developed moraines exists on the southern flank and may reflect glaciers advancing either from the summit area or a plateau at elevation; overall however glaciation on Mi\u00f1iques was of limited extent and the terrain of Mi\u00f1iques today is dominated by periglacial processes. Laguna Mi\u00f1iques lies on its northwestern foot; it was separated from Laguna Miscanti by a lava flow from Mi\u00f1iques. The mountain rises from a high ignimbrite plateau. It is of Pleistocene age and formed by andesitic and dacitic rocks; the volcano is classified as extinct, but activity of the Pliocene-Pleistocene volcano may have continued into the Holocene. There are a number of craters, some of which contain lava domes and lava flows. Stone structures and archeological sites are found on the summit and the flanks of Mi\u00f1iques mountain, and the church of Socaire is oriented towards the mountain. ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Chile * Chiliques * Cerro Miscanti * Cord\u00f3n Puntas Negras * Caichinque * Los Flamencos National Reserve * Chile == References == === Sources === * == Further sources == * ==External links== * SI Google Earth Placemarks - Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program: download placemarks with SI Holocene volcano-data.
