Robbins is known for his studies regarding the First Amendment, and has been quoted in many articles discussing the use of the finger and freedom of expression. He has stated that, while giving a police officer the finger is \"not the smartest thing to do,\" it is not illegal and a conviction for the gesture would likely not be upheld by the Supreme Court.
