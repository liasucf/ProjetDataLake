    "text": "Complex of deities at an outdoors fountain-altar with incense burners at a pilgrimage area in Weihai, Shandong. At the centre stands Mazu surrounded by the four Dragon Gods () and various lesser deities. Distant behind Mazu stands the Sun Goddess (). Chinese traditional religion is polytheistic; many deities are worshipped in a pantheistic view where divinity is inherent in the world. The gods are energies or principles revealing, imitating and propagating the way of Heaven (Tian ), which is the supreme godhead manifesting in the northern culmen of the starry vault of the skies and its order. Many gods are ancestors or men who became deities for their heavenly achievements; most gods are also identified with stars and constellations. Ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society, and therefore as the means connecting back to Heaven, which is the \"utmost ancestral father\" ( z\u0113ngz\u01d4f\u00f9). Gods are innumerable, as every phenomenon has or is one or more gods, and they are organised in a complex celestial hierarchy. Besides the traditional worship of these entities, Confucianism, Taoism and formal thinkers in general give theological interpretations affirming a monistic essence of divinity. \"Polytheism\" and \"monotheism\" are categories derived from Western religion and do not fit Chinese religion, which has never conceived the two things as opposites. Since all gods are considered manifestations of q\u00ec, the \"power\" or pneuma of Heaven, some scholars have employed the term \"polypneumatism\" or \"(poly)pneumatolatry\", first coined by Walter Medhurst (1796\u20131857), to describe the practice of Chinese polytheism. In the theology of the classic texts and Confucianism, \"Heaven is the lord of the hundreds of deities\". Modern Confucian theology compares them to intelligence, substantial forms or entelechies (inner purposes) as explained by Leibniz, generating all types of beings, so that \"even mountains and rivers are worshipped as something capable of enjoying sacrificial offerings\". Unlike in Hinduism, the deification of historical persons and ancestors is not traditionally the duty of Confucians or Taoists. Rather depends on the choices of common people; persons are deified when they have made extraordinary deeds and have left an efficacious legacy. Yet, Confucians and Taoists traditionally may demand that state honour be granted to a particular deity. Each deity has a cult centre and ancestral temple where he or she, or the parents, lived their mortal life. There are frequently disputes over which is the original place and source temple of the cult of a deity. ==Terminology== In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between sh\u00e9n, d\u00ec and xi\u0101n. Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between \"god\" and \"deity\", Latin genius (meaning a generative principle, \"spirit\") and deus or 'Deva' ( sanskrit ) and 'divus; d\u00ec, sometimes translated as \"thearch\", implies a manifested or incarnate \"godly\" power. It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of di as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the Shuowen Jiezi explaining \"deity\" as \"what faces the base of a melon fruit\". The latter term xi\u0101n unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, ( Xian sounds similar to Sanskrit word Chiranjeevi, The Immortal one) similarly to the Western idea of \"hero\". ==God of Heaven== Like other symbols such as the swastika, w\u00e0n (\"myriad things\") in Chinese, and the Mesopotamian \ud808\udc2d Dingir/An (\"Heaven\"), pp. 97\u201398, note 26. and also the Chinese w\u016b (\"shaman\"; in Shang script represented by the cross potent \u2629), Ti\u0101n refers to the northern celestial pole ( B\u011bij\u00ed), the pivot and the vault of the sky with its spinning constellations. Here is an approximate representation of the Ti\u0101nm\u00e9n (\"Gate of Heaven\") or Ti\u0101nsh\u016b (\"Pivot of Heaven\") as the precessional north celestial pole, with \u03b1 Ursae Minoris as the pole star, with the spinning Chariot constellations in the four phases of time. According to Reza Assasi's theories, the wan may not only be centred in the current precessional pole at \u03b1 Ursae Minoris, but also very near to the north ecliptic pole if Draco (Ti\u0101nl\u00f3ng ) is conceived as one of its two beams. Chinese traditional theology, which comes in different interpretations according to the classic texts, and specifically Confucian, Taoist and other philosophical formulations, is fundamentally monistic, that is to say it sees the world and the gods who produce it as an organic whole, or cosmos. The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as transcendent and immanent to creation, at the same time. The Chinese idea of the universal God is expressed in different ways; there are many names of God from the different sources of Chinese tradition. The radical Chinese terms for the universal God are Ti\u0101n and Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec (the \"Highest Deity\") or simply D\u00ec (\"Deity\"). There is also the concept of T\u00e0id\u00ec (the \"Great Deity\"). D\u00ec is a title expressing dominance over the all-under-Heaven, that is all things generated by Heaven and ordered by its cycles and by the stars. Ti\u0101n is usually translated as \"Heaven\", but by graphical etymology it means \"Great One\" and a number of scholars relate it to the same D\u00ec through phonetic etymology and trace their common root, through their archaic forms respectively *Tee\u014b and *Tees, to the symbols of the squared north celestial pole godhead (D\u012bng ). These names are combined in different ways in Chinese theological literature, often interchanged in the same paragraph if not in the same sentence. ===Names of the God of Heaven=== Obatala is known by many names. Besides Shangdi and Taidi, other names include Yudi (\"Jade Deity\") can change into Obatala, and Taiyi (\"Great Oneness\") who, in mythical imagery, holds the ladle of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot) providing the movement of life to the world. As the hub of the skies, the north celestial pole constellations are known, among various names, as Ti\u0101nm\u00e9n (\"Gate of Heaven\") p. 190. and Ti\u0101nsh\u016b (\"Pivot of Heaven\"). p. 343, note 17. Other names of the God of Heaven are attested in the vast Chinese religio-philosophical literary tradition: * Ti\u0101nd\u00ec \u2014the \"Deity of Heaven\" or \"Emperor of Heaven\": \"On Rectification\" (Zheng lun) of the Xunzi uses this term to refer to the active God of Heaven setting in motion creation; * Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4 \u2014the \"Lord of Heaven\": In \"The Document of Offering Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on the Mountain Tai\" (Fengshan shu) of the Records of the Grand Historian it is used as the title of the first God from whom all the other gods derive. * Ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng \u2014the \"King of Heaven\": In the \"Poem of Fathoming Profundity\" (Si'xuan fu), transcribed in \"The History of the Later Han Dynasty\" (Hou Han shu), Zhang Heng ornately writes: \u00abI ask the superintendent of the Heavenly Gate to open the door and let me visit the King of Heaven at the Jade Palace\u00bb; * Ti\u0101ng\u014dng \u2014the \"Duke of Heaven\" or \"General of Heaven\"; * Ti\u0101nj\u016bn \u2014the \"Prince of Heaven\" or \"Lord of Heaven\"; * Ti\u0101nz\u016bn \u2014the \"Heavenly Venerable\", also a title for high gods in Taoist theologies; * Ti\u0101nsh\u00e9n \u2014the \"God of Heaven\", interpreted in the Shuowen Jiezi as \"the being that gives birth to all things\"; * Sh\u00e9nhu\u00e1ng \u2014\"God the King\", attested in Taihong (\"The Origin of Vital Breath\"); * L\u01ceoti\u0101ny\u00e9 ()\u2014the \"Olden Heavenly Father\". Tian is both transcendent and immanent, manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature of things. In the Wujing yiyi (, \"Different Meanings in the Five Classics\"), Xu Shen explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple: * Hu\u00e1ng Ti\u0101n \u2014\"Yellow Heaven\" or \"Shining Heaven\", when it is venerated as the lord of creation; * H\u00e0o Ti\u0101n \u2014\"Vast Heaven\", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (qi); * M\u00edn Ti\u0101n \u2014\"Compassionate Heaven\", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all- under-Heaven; * Sh\u00e0ng Ti\u0101n \u2014\"Highest Heaven\" or \"First Heaven\", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven; * C\u0101ng Ti\u0101n \u2014\"Deep-Green Heaven\", for it being unfathomably deep. All these designations reflect a hierarchical, multiperspective experience of divinity. ==Lists of gods, deities and immortals== Main altar and statue of Doumu inside the Temple of Doumu in Butterworth, Penang, Malaysia. A temple dedicated to Pangu in Zhunan, Miaoli. Many classical books have lists and hierarchies of gods and immortals, among which the \"Completed Record of Deities and Immortals\" (, Sh\u00e9nxi\u0101n T\u014dngji\u00e0n) of the Ming dynasty, and the Biographies of the Deities and Immortals or Shenxian Zhuan by Ge Hong (284-343). There's also the older Collected Biographies of the Immortals or Liexian Zhuan. Couplets or polarities, such as Fuxi and Nuwa, Xiwangmu and Dongwanggong, and the highest couple of Heaven and Earth, all embody yin and yang and are at once the originators and maintainers of the ordering process of space and time. Stoneware figure of a Daoist (Taoist) deity. From China, Ming Dynasty, 16th century CE. The British Museum ===Cosmic gods=== * Yudi ( \"Jade Deity\") or Yuhuang ( \"Jade Emperor\" or \"Jade King\"), is the popular human-like representation of the God of Heaven. Jade traditionally represents purity, so it is a metaphor for the unfathomable source of creation. * Doumu ( \"Mother of the Great Chariot\"), often entitled with the honorific Tianhou ( \"Queen of Heaven\") is the heavenly goddess portrayed as the mother of the Big Dipper (Great Chariot), whose seven stars in addition to two invisible ones are conceived as her sons, the Jiuhuangshen ( \"Nine God-Kings\"), themselves regarded as the ninefold manifestation of Jiuhuangdadi (, \"Great Deity of the Nine Kings\") or Doufu \"Father of the Great Chariot\"), another name of the God of Heaven. She is therefore both wife and mother of the God of Heaven. p. 19. * Pangu (), a macranthropic metaphor of the cosmos. He separated yin and yang, creating the earth (murky yin) and the sky (clear yang). All things were made from his body after he died. * Xiwangmu ( \"Queen Mother of the West\"), identified with the Kunlun Mountain, shamanic inspiration, death and immortality. She is the dark, chthonic goddess, pure yin, at the same time terrifying and benign, both creation and destruction, associated with the tiger and weaving. Her male counterpart is Dongwanggong ( \"King Duke of the East\"; also called Mugong, \u6728\u516c \"Duke of the Woods\"), who represents the yang principle. ** Yi the Archer (H\u00f2uy\u00ec ) was a man who sought for immortality reaching Xiwangmu on her mountain Kunlun. * Yanwang ( \"Purgatory King\") the ruler of the underworld, assisted by the Heibai Wuchang ( \"Black and White Impermanence\") representing the alternation of yin and yang principles, alongside Ox-Head and Horse-Face, who escort spirits to his realm. * Yinyanggong ( \"Yinyang Duke\") or Yinyangsi ( \"Yinyang Controller\"), the personification of the union of yin and yang. ====Three Patrons and Five Deities==== W\u01d4f\u0101ng Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec \u4e94\u65b9\u4e0a\u5e1d \u2014 The order of Heaven inscribing worlds as t\u00e1n , \"altar\", the Chinese concept equivalent to the Indian mandala. The supreme God conceptualised as the Yellow Deity, and Xuanyuan as its human form, is the heart of the universe and the other Four Deities are his emanations. The diagram is based on the Huainanzi. Statue and ceremonial complex of the Yellow and Red Gods in Zhengzhou, Henan. Zhangpu, Fujian. Temple of the Great Deity of the Eastern Peak at Mount Tai, Tai'an, Shandong. * S\u0101nhu\u00e1ng \u2014 Three Patrons (or Augusts) or S\u0101nc\u00e1i \u2014 Three Potencies; they are the \"vertical\" manifestation of Heaven spatially corresponding to the Three Realms ( S\u0101nji\u00e8), representing the yin and yang and the medium between them, that is the human being: ** F\u00fax\u012b the patron of heaven ( Ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng), also called B\u0101gu\u00e0z\u01d4sh\u012b ( \"Venerable Inventor of the Bagua\") by the Taoists, is a divine man reputed to have taught to humanity writing, fishing, and hunting. ** N\u01daw\u0101 the patron of earth ( Dehu\u00e1ng), is a goddess attributed for the creation of mankind and mending the order of the world when it was broken. ** Sh\u00e9nn\u00f3ng \u2014 Peasant God, the patron of humanity ( R\u00e9nhu\u00e1ng), identified as Y\u00e1nd\u00ec ( \"Flame Deity\" or \"Fiery Deity\"), a divine man said to have taught the techniques of farming, herbal medicine and marketing. He is often represented as a human with horns and other features of an ox. * W\u01d4d\u00ec \u2014 Five Deities, also W\u01d4f\u0101ng Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec ( \"Five Manifestations of the Highest Deity\"), W\u01d4f\u0101ng Ti\u0101nsh\u00e9n ( \"Five Manifestations of the Heavenly God\"), W\u01d4f\u0101ngd\u00ec ( \"Five Forms Deity\"), W\u01d4ti\u0101nd\u00ec ( \"Five Heavenly Deities\"), W\u01d4l\u01ceoj\u016bn ( \"Five Ancient Lords\"), W\u01d4d\u00e0osh\u00e9n ( \"Five Ways God(s)\"); they are the five main \"horizontal\" manifestations of Heaven and according with the Three Potencies they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. They correspond to the five phases of creation, the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole and five planets, the five sacred mountains and five directions of space (their terrestrial form), and the five Dragon Gods which represent their mounts, that is to say the material forces they preside over (their chthonic form). ** Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec \u2014 Yellow Emperor or Yellow Deity; or Hu\u00e1ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Yellow God, also known as Xu\u0101nyu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec ( \"Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft\"), is the Zh\u014dngyu\u00e8d\u00e0d\u00ec ( \"Great Deity of the Central Peak\"): he represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon, and is associated with Saturn. The character hu\u00e1ng, for \"yellow\", also means, by homophony and shared etymology with hu\u00e1ng, \"august\", \"creator\" and \"radiant\", identifying the Yellow Emperor with Shangdi (the \"Highest Deity\"). Huangdi represents the heart of creation, the axis mundi (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality. As the deity of the centre, intersecting the Three Patrons and the Five Deities, in the Shizi he is described as \"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\" ( Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec S\u00ecmi\u00e0n). As a human, he is said to have been the fruit of a virginal birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning from the Big Dipper (Great Chariot). She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan (Chariot Shaft), after which he was named. p. 246. He is reputed to be the founder of the Huaxia civilisation, and the Han Chinese identify themselves as the descendants of Yandi and Huangdi. ** C\u0101ngd\u00ec \u2014 Green Deity; or Q\u012bngd\u00ec \u2014 Blue Deity or Bluegreen Deity, the D\u014dngd\u00ec ( \"East Deity\") or D\u014dngyu\u00e8d\u00e0d\u00ec ( \"Great Deity of the Eastern Peak\"): he is T\u00e0ih\u00e0o , associated with the essence of wood and with Jupiter, and is the god of fertility and spring. The Bluegreen Dragon is both his animal form and constellation. His female consort is the goddess of fertility Bixia. ** H\u0113id\u00ec \u2014 Black Deity, the B\u011bid\u00ec ( \"North Deity\") or B\u011biyu\u00e8d\u00e0d\u00ec ( \"Great Deity of the Northern Peak\"): he is Zhu\u0101nx\u016b (), today frequently worshipped as Xu\u00e1nw\u01d4 ( \"Dark Warrior\") or Zh\u0113nw\u01d4 (), and is associated with the essence of water and winter, and with Mercury. His animal form is the Black Dragon and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake. ** Ch\u00ecd\u00ec \u2014 Red Deity, the N\u00e1nd\u00ec ( \"South Deity\") or N\u00e1nyu\u00e8d\u00e0d\u00ec ( \"Great Deity of the Southern Peak\"): he is Shennong (the \"Divine Farmer\"), the Yandi (\"Fiery Deity\"), associated with the essence of fire and summer, and with Mars. His animal form is the Red Dragon and his stellar animal is the phoenix. He is the god of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal plants and market. ** B\u00e1id\u00ec \u2014 White Deity, the X\u012bd\u00ec ( \"West Deity\") or X\u012byu\u00e8d\u00e0d\u00ec ( \"Great Deity of the Western Peak\"): he is Sh\u01ceoh\u00e0o (), and is the god of the essence of metal and autumn, associated with Venus. His animal form is the White Dragon and his stellar animal the tiger. * S\u0101ngu\u0101n or S\u0101ngu\u0101nd\u00e0d\u00ec \u2014 Three Officials [of Heaven] or Three Officer Great Deities: Yao the Official of Heaven (Ti\u0101ngu\u0101n ), Shun the Official of Earth (Degu\u0101n ), and Yu the Official of Water (Shu\u01d0gu\u0101n ). In mythology, Huangdi and Yandi fought a battle against each other; and Huang finally defeated Yan with the help of the Dragon (the controller of water, who is Huangdi himself). pp. 156-157 This myth symbolises the equipoise of yin and yang, here the fire of knowledge (reason and craft) and earthly stability. Yan is flame, scorching fire, or an excess of it (it is important to note that graphically it is a double huo, \"fire\"). As an excess of fire brings destruction to the earth, it has to be controlled by a ruling principle. Nothing is good in itself, without limits; good outcomes depend on the proportion in the composition of things and their interactions, never on extremes in absolute terms. Huangdi and Yandi are complementary opposites, necessary for the existence of one another, and they are powers that exist together within the human being. ===Gods of celestial and terrestrial phenomena=== Temple of the Wind God in Tainan. * L\u00f3ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Dragon Gods, or L\u00f3ngw\u00e1ng \u2014 Dragon Kings: also S\u00ech\u01cei L\u00f3ngw\u00e1ng ( \"Dragon Kings of the Four Seas\"), are gods of watery sources, usually reduced to four, patrons of the Four Seas (sihai ) and the four cardinal directions. They are the White Dragon ( B\u00e1il\u00f3ng), the Black Dragon ( Xu\u00e1nl\u00f3ng), the Red Dragon ( Zh\u016bl\u00f3ng), and the Bluegreen Dragon ( Q\u012bngl\u00f3ng). Corresponding with the Five Deities as the chthonic forces that they sublimate (the Dragon Gods are often represented as the \"mount\" of the Five Deities), they inscribe the land of China into an ideal sacred squared boundary. The fifth dragon, the Yellow Dragon ( Hu\u00e1ngl\u00f3ng), is the dragon of the centre representing the Yellow God. * B\u00e1osh\u00e9n \u2014 Hail God * B\u0101l\u00e0, Ch\u00f3ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Insect God, or Ch\u00f3ngw\u00e1ng \u2014 Insect King: the gods of insects * D\u00f2ush\u00e9n \u2014 Smallpox God * F\u0113ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Wind God, or F\u0113i Li\u00e1n * H\u01ceish\u00e9n \u2014 Sea God, or H\u01ceiy\u00e9 \u2014 Sea Lord * H\u00e9sh\u00e9n \u2014 River God: any watercourse god among which one of the most revered is the god of the Yellow River, H\u00e9b\u00f3 \u2014 River Lord * G\u01d4sh\u00e9n \u2014 Valley God, in the Daodejing a name used to refer to the Way * Hu\u01d2sh\u00e9n \u2014 Fire God, often personified as Zh\u00f9r\u00f3ng () * H\u00fash\u00e9n \u2014 Lake God * J\u012bnsh\u00e9n \u2014 Gold God, often identified as the Qi\u016bsh\u00e9n \u2014 Autumn God, and personified as R\u00f9sh\u014du () * J\u01d0ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Waterspring God * L\u00e9ish\u00e9n \u2014 Thunder God, or L\u00e9ig\u014dng \u2014 Thunder Duke; his consort is Di\u00e0nm\u01d4 \u2014 Lightning Mother * M\u00f9sh\u00e9n \u2014 Woodland God, usually the same as the Ch\u016bnsh\u00e9n \u2014 Spring God, and as J\u00f9m\u00e1ng () * Sh\u0101nsh\u00e9n \u2014 Mountain God * Shu\u01d0sh\u00e9n \u2014 Water God * T\u01d4d\u00ecsh\u00e9n \u2014 God of the Local Land, or T\u01d4sh\u00e9n \u2014 Earth God, or T\u01d4d\u00ecg\u014dng \u2014 Duke of the Local Land: the tutelary deity of any locality whose female counterpart is H\u00f2ut\u01d4 \u2014 Queen of the Earth * W\u0113nsh\u00e9n \u2014 Plague God * Xi\u0101ngshu\u01d0sh\u00e9n \u2014 Xiang Waters' Goddesses, are the patrons of the Xiang River * Xu\u011bsh\u00e9n \u2014 Snow God * Y\u01d4sh\u00e9n \u2014 Rain God * X\u012bh\u00e9 the T\u00e0iy\u00e1ngsh\u00e9n \u2014 Great Sun Goddess, or Sh\u00edr\u00eczh\u012bm\u01d4 \u2014 Mother of the Ten Suns * Yu\u00e8sh\u00e9n \u2014 Moon Goddesses: Ch\u00e1ngx\u012b or Sh\u00ed'\u00e8ryu\u00e8zh\u012bm\u01d4 \u2014 Mother of the Twelve Moons, and Ch\u00e1ng'\u00e9 ===Gods of human virtues and crafts=== Guan Yu (middle), Guan Ping (his right) and Zhou Cang (his left) at a Chinese folk religious temple in Osaka, Japan.

The worship of mother goddesses for the cultivation of offspring is present all over China, but predominantly in northern provinces. There are nine main goddesses, and all of them tend to be considered as manifestations or attendant forces of a singular goddess identified variously as the Lady of the Blue Dawn (B\u00ecxi\u00e1 Yu\u00e1nj\u016bn , also known as the Ti\u0101nxi\u0101n Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng , \"Heavenly Immortal Lady\", or T\u00e0ish\u0101n Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng , \"Lady of Mount Tai\", or also Ji\u01d4ti\u0101n Sh\u00e8ngm\u01d4 , \"Holy Mother of the Nine Skies\") or Houtu, the goddess of the earth. Bixia herself is identified by Taoists as the more ancient goddess Xiwangmu, The general Chinese term for \"goddess\" is n\u01dash\u00e9n, and goddesses may receive many qualifying titles including m\u01d4 ( \"mother\"), l\u01ceom\u01d4 ( \"old mother\"), sh\u00e8ngm\u01d4 ( \"holy mother\"), ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng ( \"lady\"), n\u01ceinai ( \"granny\"). The additional eight main goddesses of fertility, reproduction and growth are: * B\u0101nzh\u011bn Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who protects children from illness; * Cu\u012bsh\u0113ng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who gives swift childbirth and protects midwives; * N\u01ceim\u01d4 Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who presides over maternal milk and protects nursing; * P\u00e9ig\u016b Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who cultivate children; * P\u00e9iy\u01ceng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who protects the upbringing of children; * S\u00f2ngzi Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng or Z\u01d0s\u016bn Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who presides over offspring; * Y\u01cengu\u0101ng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who protects eyesight; * Y\u01d0nm\u00e9ng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, the goddess who guides young children. Altars of goddess worship are usually arranged with Bixia at the center and two goddesses at her sides, most frequently the Lady of Eyesight and the Lady of Offspring. A different figure but with the same astral connections as Bixia is the Goddess of the Seven Stars ( Q\u012bx\u012bng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng). There is also the cluster of the Holy Mothers of the Three Skies ( S\u0101nxi\u0101o Sh\u00e8ngm\u01d4; or S\u0101nxi\u0101o Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng, \"Ladies of the Three Stars\"), composed of Yunxiao Guniang, Qiongxiao Guniang and Bixiao Guniang. The cult of Chenjinggu present in southeast China is identified by some scholars as an emanation of the northern cult of Bixia. pp. 349-350. Other goddesses worshipped in China include C\u00e1nm\u01d4 ( Silkworm Mother) or C\u00e1ng\u016b ( Silkworm Maiden), identified with L\u00e9iz\u01d4 (, the wife of the Yellow Emperor), M\u00e1g\u016b ( \"Hemp Maiden\"), S\u01ceoq\u012bng Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng ( Goddess who Sweeps Clean), S\u0101nzh\u014du Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng ( Goddess of the Three Isles), and Wusheng Laomu. Mother goddess is central in the theology of many folk religious sects. ===Gods of northeast China=== Northeast China has clusters of deities which are peculiar to the area, deriving from the Manchu and broader Tungusic substratum of the local population. Animal deities related to shamanic practices are characteristic of the area and reflect wider Chinese cosmology. Besides the aforementioned Fox Gods ( H\u00faxi\u0101n), they include: * Hu\u00e1ngxi\u0101n \u2014 Yellow Immortal, the Weasel God * Sh\u00e9xi\u0101n \u2014 Snake Immortal, also variously called Li\u01d4xi\u0101n \u2014 Immortal Liu, or Ch\u00e1ngxi\u0101n \u2014 Viper Immortal, or also M\u01cengxi\u0101n \u2014 Python or Boa Immortal * B\u00e1ixi\u0101n \u2014 White Immortal, the Hedgehog God * H\u0113ixi\u0101n \u2014 Black Immortal, who may be the W\u016by\u0101xi\u0101n \u2014 Crow Immortal, or the Hu\u012bxi\u0101n \u2014 Rat Immortal, with the latter considered a misinterpretation of the former ===Gods of Indian origin=== Temple of the Four-Faced God in Changhua, Taiwan.
