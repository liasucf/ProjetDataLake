    "text": "Piano Vibrations, though promoted in its re-release as the first studio album by English progressive rock keyboardist Rick Wakeman, is not considered a Wakeman album, even by himself. His contributions were limited to performing as a session musician and he did not compose any of the tracks. The album was released in 1971 on Polydor, after Wakeman had signed on to A&M; Records. The album developed from Wakeman's time as a session musician. Wakeman as session musician is also mentioned in the Rick Wakeman article under Wikipedia. A&M; Records had signed Wakeman on as the Strawbs' keyboardist at the time of the release. ==Track listing== SourceTrack listing ===Side one=== #\"Take Me to the Pilot\" (Elton John, Bernie Taupin) \u2013 3:00 #\"Yellow Man\" (Randy Newman) \u2013 2:36 #\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" (Vince Guaraldi, Carel Werber) \u2013 2:35 #\"Gloria, Gloria\" (John Schroeder, Anthony King) \u2013 3:08 #\"Your Song\" (Elton John, Bernie Taupin) \u2013 3:45 ===Side two=== #\"Delta Lady\" (Leon Russell) \u2013 3:26 #\"A Picture of You\" (John Schroeder, Anthony King) \u2013 2:59 #\"Home Sweet Oklahoma\" (Leon Russell) \u2013 3:22 #\"Fire and Rain\" (James Taylor) \u2013 3:25 #\"Classical Gas\" (Mason Williams) \u2013 2:56 ==Musicians== *Rick Wakeman: Grand Piano ==References== Category:1971 debut albums Category:Rick Wakeman albums Category:Polydor Records albums ",
