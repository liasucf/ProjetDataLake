    "text": "In British politics, the Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, or informally Shadow Brexit Secretary, was a position within the opposition's shadow cabinet that dealt with issues surrounding the UK withdrawal from the EU. The position was only ever a part of Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet. If a Labour government had been elected, the Shadow Secretary of State would have been a likely choice to serve as the new Secretary of State. Keir Starmer held the position between October 2016 and April 2020, although the position became unusual, as the Department for Exiting the European Union was abolished in January 2020, so there was no Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union to be shadowed. The position was formally abolished on 4 April 2020, once the incumbent Shadow Brexit Secretary was elected leader. There were also a number of Shadow Ministers for Brexit, that often deputised for the Secretary of State. ==List of Shadow Secretaries of State for Exiting the European Union== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" ! colspan=2|Name ! width=60|Portrait ! colspan=2|Term of office !
