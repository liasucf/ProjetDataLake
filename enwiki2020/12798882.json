It was released as the second single from his second studio album, It's Only Time, on October 16, 2007. \"Makes Me Happy\" was originally used as score music for the Nickelodeon show Zoey 101 and some of it was sung by Backhouse Mike in the Zoey 101 episode \"Quinn's Alpaca\". The song was used in the Drake & Josh episode \"Really Big Shrimp\", however the version heard in it is a different version than the version on It's Only Time.
