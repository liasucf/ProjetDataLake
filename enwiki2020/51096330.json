She has appeared on numerous radio programmes, including on BBC Radio 4 discussing human senses and perception. In relation to debates about the issue of all-male panels at academic conferences, Macpherson has warned against tokenism, noting that she had herself organised an all-male panel, when the prominent women she invited were unavailable. She stated that \"I think that it is even all right to only invite men as speakers to some events, if that is appropriate because of research that you want to hear about and the theme of the conference\". Macpherson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2017 and a member of Academia Europaea in 2018. ==References== ==External links== *University of Glasgow profile page Category:1971 births Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow Category:Living people Category:Scottish philosophers Category:Scottish women philosophers ",
