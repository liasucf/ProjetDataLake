At the age of 16 he first went to sea as an apprentice aboard Astoria. His life nearly ended when he fell from the main upper topsail yard to the deck, he instead spent six months in a Singapore hospital. He gained his second mate's certificate after some years aboard one of Devitt & Moore's sail training vessels, and around the same time learned the art of watercolor painting, and was soon receiving commissions from other seafarers. He finished his life at sea as a sailor with the Blue Anchor line of steamers. Spurling's second love was the stage, and promising career as an actor but success as a painter intruded: In 1921 he met Frederick Arthur Hook (died 1935), editor of The Blue Peter: The Magazine of Sea Travel, Price 1/-, a magazine for sailing enthusiasts. Hook purchased much of Spurling's portfolio of work, and contracted him to supply artwork for the covers of his magazine, the first being the issue of March 1923. ==Bibliography== Spurling's artwork for The Blue Peter was collected in three volumes, all with artwork by Spurling, text by Basil Lubbock and edited by F. A. Hook: *Sail: The Romance of the Clipper Ships Vol. I (1923) *Sail: The Romance of the Clipper Ships Vol. II (1929) *Sail: The Romance of the Clipper Ships Vol. III (1933) == References == ==External links== Category:English watercolourists Category:British marine artists Category:1870 births Category:1933 deaths ",
