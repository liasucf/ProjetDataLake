    "text": "Back Hand is an album by jazz pianist Keith Jarrett recorded in two sessions in October 1974 that also gave way to the album Death and the Flower. Originally released in 1975 by Impulse!, it features performances by Jarrett's 'American Quartet' which included Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian along with Guilherme Franco added on percussion. For a long time the album remained a relatively obscure work until it was resuscitated by Impulse! years later. Aside from its appearance in The Impulse Years: 1973-1974 boxset in 1997, the music contained in Back Hand had only been reissued on compact disc in Japan, packaged in a miniature replica of the original vinyl LP sleeve. It also appeared in Italy, in 2001, as a supplement to \"La Repubblica\" national newspaper, copyrighted as \"Musicom S.R.L.\" ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4.5 stars stating \"The group (with Jarrett occasionally switching to flute and Redman to the bizarre-sounding musette) is in typically exploratory, yet often melodic form on lengthy renditions of four of Jarrett's inside/outside originals.\".Yanow, S.
