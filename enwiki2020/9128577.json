    "text": "The McCormack rankings were unofficial world golf rankings published in Mark McCormack's World of Professional Golf Annual from 1968 to 1985, and were a forerunner of the current Official World Golf Ranking. Unlike their replacement they were not used to select fields for tournaments, and served no real purpose other than as a talking point. The rankings were the first that had been compiled that took account of results from all the world's major professional tours, from the United States, Europe, Japan, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The system rewarded players for their finishing places in tournaments played over a three-year period, with more points awarded for more recent achievements, and more points awarded for major championships and tour events with strong fields than for those in other tournaments. They also reflected McCormack's philosophy that victory should be strongly rewarded, wherever in the world it took place \u2013 winners of tournaments received additional bonus points, and only high finishers in tournaments received any recognition - for example just the top ten places received ranking points in major championships. The first player to lead the rankings was McCormack's client Jack Nicklaus (although Nicklaus left his business arrangement with McCormack in 1970), and he continued to lead them for almost all of the 1970s decade. He would be succeeded as number one in 1978 by Tom Watson, who in turn was succeeded in 1983 by Seve Ballesteros. Had McCormack's rankings of the time been based on results over just the most recent two years, like their modern counterpart, Gary Player would have been number one in 1969 instead of Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd number one at the end of 1982 instead of Tom Watson (despite the latter's two major victories that summer) and Bernhard Langer would have been number one at the end of 1985 instead of Ballesteros. All the other year-end number ones, however, would have remained as they were on the three-year system.(tables published in) The World of Professional Golf, Mark H. McCormack (published annually 1967 to 1986) The first ranking list, taking account of results from January 1966 to December 1968, included five American players in the top ten (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Julius Boros and Frank Beard) and five non-Americans (Gary Player, Bob Charles, Neil Coles, Peter Thomson and Kel Nagle). By 1976, the ranking list was almost totally dominated by American players \u2013 Nicklaus, Hale Irwin and Johnny Miller were the world's top three \u2013 and only two of the top ten (Gary Player and Graham Marsh) were non-Americans. The last ranking lists, published in the mid-1980s, reflected the shift in dominance back away from American golfers by that time \u2013 in 1984, five of the top ten were non-American, and in the last list published in December 1985, the top three players in the world \u2013 Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and Greg Norman \u2013 were all non-American. In the years the rankings were published, the highest position attained by a British player was sixth \u2013 by Tony Jacklin in 1972, and Nick Faldo in 1984. The rankings were notable for the high positions reached by the leading Japanese players of the day, with Masashi Ozaki, Isao Aoki and Tsuneyuki Nakajima all achieving top-ten rankings at various times. In 1986 McCormack's system was taken up by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and became the Sony Rankings. At first the Sony Rankings were only used by the R&A; to exempt players from qualifying for The Open Championship (in particular to allow invititations to be sent to the leading American players, some of whom were reluctant to travel to have to pre-qualify), but in 1997 they were endorsed by all of the principal men's professional tours (five at that time) and renamed the Official World Golf Ranking. Over the years the Official rankings have come to be used to select players for an increasing number of important tournaments, including the major championships, the World Golf Championships and the European Ryder Cup side. ==Ranking leaders== {|class = \"wikitable\" !Year || No. 1 || No. 2 || No. 3 || No. 4 || No. 5 || No. 6 || No. 7 || No. 8 || No. 9 || No. 10 |- |1968 || Jack Nicklaus || Arnold Palmer || Billy Casper || Gary Player || Bob Charles || Julius Boros || Neil Coles || Peter Thomson || Frank Beard || Kel Nagle |- |1969 || Jack Nicklaus || Gary Player || Billy Casper || Arnold Palmer || Bob Charles || Frank Beard || George Archer || Lee Trevino || Miller Barber || Dan Sikes |- |1970 || Jack Nicklaus || Gary Player || Billy Casper || Lee Trevino || Bob Charles || Bruce Devlin || Neil Coles || Tony Jacklin || Frank Beard || Brian Huggett and Kel Nagle (tied) |- |1971 || Jack Nicklaus || Lee Trevino || Gary Player || Arnold Palmer || Billy Casper || Miller Barber || Bruce Crampton || Bob Charles || Bruce Devlin || Tom Weiskopf |- |1972 || Jack Nicklaus || Gary Player || Lee Trevino || Bruce Crampton || Arnold Palmer || Tony Jacklin || Tom Weiskopf || Peter Oosterhuis || Jerry Heard || Bruce Devlin |- |1973 || Jack Nicklaus || Tom Weiskopf || Lee Trevino || Gary Player || Bruce Crampton || Johnny Miller || Peter Oosterhuis || Lanny Wadkins || Jerry Heard || Gay Brewer |- |1974 || Jack Nicklaus || Johnny Miller || Gary Player || Tom Weiskopf || Lee Trevino || Masashi Ozaki || Bruce Crampton || Hale Irwin || Hubert Green || Jerry Heard |- |1975 || Jack Nicklaus || Johnny Miller || Tom Weiskopf || Hale Irwin || Gary Player || Hubert Green || Lee Trevino || Billy Casper || Bruce Crampton || Tom Watson |- |1976 || Jack Nicklaus || Hale Irwin || Johnny Miller || Gary Player || Hubert Green || Tom Watson || Tom Weiskopf || Graham Marsh || Ben Crenshaw || Al Geiberger |- |1977 || Jack Nicklaus || Tom Watson || Hubert Green || Hale Irwin || Ben Crenshaw || Graham Marsh || Gary Player || Tom Weiskopf || Raymond Floyd || Seve Ballesteros |- |1978 || Tom Watson || Jack Nicklaus || Hale Irwin || Hubert Green || Gary Player || Ben Crenshaw || Graham Marsh || Seve Ballesteros || Lee Trevino || Isao Aoki |- |1979 || Tom Watson || Jack Nicklaus || Hale Irwin || Lee Trevino || Gary Player || Isao Aoki || Hubert Green || Ben Crenshaw || Seve Ballesteros || Lanny Wadkins |- |1980 || Tom Watson || Lee Trevino || Isao Aoki || Ben Crenshaw || Jack Nicklaus || Jerry Pate || Seve Ballesteros || Andy Bean || Hale Irwin || Gary Player |- |1981 || Tom Watson || Bill Rogers || Isao Aoki || Jerry Pate || Lee Trevino || Seve Ballesteros || David Graham || Ben Crenshaw || Raymond Floyd || Bruce Lietzke |- |1982 || Tom Watson || Raymond Floyd || Seve Ballesteros || Tom Kite || Craig Stadler || Jerry Pate || Jack Nicklaus || Bill Rogers || Isao Aoki || Curtis Strange |- |1983 || Seve Ballesteros || Tom Watson || Raymond Floyd || Greg Norman || Tom Kite || Jack Nicklaus || Tsuneyuki Nakajima || Craig Stadler || Isao Aoki || Lanny Wadkins |- |1984 || Seve Ballesteros || Tom Watson || Greg Norman || Lanny Wadkins || Bernhard Langer || Nick Faldo || Tsuneyuki Nakajima || Craig Stadler || Tom Kite || Calvin Peete |- |1985 || Seve Ballesteros || Bernhard Langer || Greg Norman || Tom Watson || Tsuneyuki Nakajima || Lanny Wadkins || Mark O'Meara || Curtis Strange || Corey Pavin || Hal Sutton |} ==Ranking summary== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
