After Santiago Pico's death in 1815, the Rancho was regranted to Santiago's sons Javier Pico and his two brothers, Patricio Pico and Miguel Pico by Diego de Borica.Dise\u00f1o del Rancho Simi The name derives from Shimiji, the name of a Chumash village in the Simi Valley for thousands of years before the Spanish arrival.The Chumash ==History== Rancho Simi was a Spanish land concession in Alta California given in 1795 to Santiago Pico. After Santiago Pico's death in 1815, the Rancho was regranted to Santiago's sons Javier Pico and his two brothers, Patricio Pico and Miguel Pico by the Spanish government. Jos\u00e9 de la Guerra y Noriega, a Captain of the Santa Barbara Presidio, who had begun to acquire large amounts of land in California to raise cattle, purchased Rancho Simi from the Pico family in 1842. The grant was confirmed in 1842 by Mexican Governor Juan Alvarado.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican\u2013American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

The end of their prosperity came when several years of drought in the 1860s caused heavy losses. In 1865, the De la Guerras lost the ownership of El Rancho Sim\u00ed excluding the portion that came to be known as Rancho Tapo*. Rancho SImi (excluding Rancho Tapo) was sold to the Philadelphia and California Petroleum Company headed by Pennsylvania Railroad president, Thomas A. Scott. When no great amount of oil was discovered, Scott began to sell the rancho. In 1887, that portion of the rancho was bought by a newly formed company, the Simi Land and Water Company.\"Subdivision Map No. 3 of the Lands of the SIMI LAND and WATER COMPANY.\" 5 MR 24.

The city of Simi Valley, California incorporated in 1969.Simi Valley Historical Society *El Rancho Tapo was part of the original 113,009 acre Rancho Sim\u00ed grant, but sometime around 1820-1830, the Rancho Tapo came to be thought of as a separate place within Rancho Sim\u00ed. The last of the De la Guerras to live in Sim\u00ed Valley retreated to a 14,400-acre portion of the original rancho that was known as the Tapo Rancho. As late as February 1877, Juan De la Guerra was reported in county newspapers to be preparing to plant walnuts in the Tapo, which appears to be the final mention of their farming in relation to the original Sim\u00ed grant. The De la Guerra heirs tried every legal means, but by the 1880s, the Rancho Tapo also slipped from their ownership, as had the rest of the Rancho. ==Historic sites of the Rancho== *Simi Adobe\u2013Strathearn House \u2013 home of Robert P.
