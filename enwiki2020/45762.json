This 13th-century sovereign was named after his father, Emperor Fushimi and go- (\u5f8c), translates literally as \"later\"; and thus, he is sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Fushimi\". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the \"second one\"; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as \"Fushimi, the second\", or as \"Fushimi II\". ==Family== Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was .Titsingh, p. 274; Varley, p. 238.

During Hanazono's reign, negotiations between the Kamakura shogunate and the two lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the Bump\u014d Agreement). This agreement did not last long, as it was broken by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Fushimi was the author of a famous plea to the god of the Kamo Shrine for help in gaining the throne for his son. This plea was ultimately successful, but it was not until thirty-three years after his abdication that Go-Fushimi's son, Emperor K\u014dgon became emperor. K\u014dgon was the first of the northern court emperors backed by the Ashikaga shogunate. Emperor Go-Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi () in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 422. ===Kugy\u014d=== is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Fo-Fushimi's reign, this apex of the Daij\u014d-kan included: * Sessh\u014d, Takatsukasa Kanetada, 1298 * Sessh\u014d, Nij\u014d Kanemoto, 1298\u20131300 * Kampaku, Nij\u014d Kanemoto, 1300\u20131305 * Sadaijin * Udaijin * Nadaijin * Dainagon ==Eras of Go-Fushimi's reign== The years of Go-Fushimi's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or neng\u014d.Titsingh, p. 274. * Einin (1293\u20131299) * Sh\u014dan (1299\u20131302) ==See also== * Emperor of Japan * List of Emperors of Japan * Imperial cult ==Notes== Japanese Imperial kamon \u2014 a stylized chrysanthemum blossom ==References== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
