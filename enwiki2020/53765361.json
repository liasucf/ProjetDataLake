    "text": "Pacer, originally titled Formula Fusion, is a futuristic racing video game developed by R8 Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is set to release on September 17, 2020. However, it was delayed until the end of September 2020. On October 19, R8 announced that game would come out on October 29. A kickstarter campaign by R8 Games was successful in securing over \u00a379,000 to begin development on the game which was released as an early access version through Steam in August 2015. The game was re-branded from Formula Fusion to Pacer in early 2019. The game started as a spiritual successor to the Wipeout series with some of the early R8 Games staff having worked on Wipeout 3 for Psygnosis Leeds. R8 Games founder Andrew Walker was part of the team that were awarded a BAFTA for best design on Wipeout 3 in 1999. The Designers Republic, the graphic design studio that designed visual assets and marketing for the first three Wipeout games, has also contributed to the game. The game uses the Unreal 4 game engine with modifications to the open source code to enhance the feeling of speed. ==Reception== Formula Fusion received very mixed reviews upon exiting early access. Critics praised the graphics, the sound, and claimed that the game felt very true to the Wipeout series, while heavily criticizing the insubstantial amount of content as well as unforeseen bugs. Many critics claimed that the game felt unfinished and not ready for full release outside of early access.http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/formula-fusion ==References== ==External links== *Pacer on Steam *Delay announcement on twitter Category:2017 video games Category:Futuristic racing games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Xbox One games ",
