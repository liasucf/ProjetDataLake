    "text": "Paroo Shire Honour Board is a heritage-listed memorial at the Civic Centre, Louise Street, Cunnamulla, Shire of Paroo, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1918 by Wunderlich. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. == History == The Paroo Honour Board commemorates those from Paroo Shire who served in World War I and was unveiled in 1918 by the then Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams. It was originally located in the old Paroo Shire Hall, but is now in the current Civic Centre. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead, but also those who fought and returned. Australians were proud that their first great national army was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they paid the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Many communities honoured their volunteers after the war ended, but the Paroo board is early and was installed before the close of hostilities. It has the date of the commencement of the war, 1914, on the left hand side of the memorial, but the corresponding space on the other side is empty. Spaces have also been left for names to be added. The design selected is a handsome, but standard type of Wunderlich honour board found in a number of other towns in Queensland. It commemorates all those from Paroo Shire who served in World War I, the dead not being indicated in any way. Beneath the standard words \"Roll of Honor\" and British and Australian flags is a plaque on which \"Paroo Shire\" is encircled by the commemorative inscriptions \"Brave hearts and true, God guide them\" and \"Shall their sacrifice be in vain?\" This is an uncommon challenge; a more usual inscription on similar Wunderlich honour boards is 'Those who answered the Empire's call'. The Honour Board was relocated to the public foyer of the new Civic Centre in 1971. This was officially opened by the then Queensland Premier, Hon Joh Bjelke-Petersen on 23 April 1971. == Description == The Paroo Honour Board is a panel of pressed copper; richly decorated in low relief with patriotic symbols such as flags, laurel wreaths and cannons. This decoration provides a rich frame for columns of names, each on an individual brass strip. The honour board is mounted on a marble slab, measuring , which is in turn mounted on a wooden frame with a bronze edge trim. A total of 370 names of those who served in World War I are listed alphabetically with further spaces indicating that hostilities had not yet ceased at that time. In the tradition of memorials, the rank of the deceased is not indicated. == Heritage listing == Close-up of the Paroo Shire Honour Board, 1997 Paroo Shire Honour Board was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.
