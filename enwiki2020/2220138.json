Paine was the son of Charles Jackson Paine who was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and also was the younger brother to Sumner Paine. He graduated from Harvard College.https://www.olympic.org/news/john-and-sumner-paine-usa- shooting Paine was a member of the Boston Athletic Association, the association were sending over members to Athens for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Paine decided to go along but first stopped in Paris to convince his brother Sumner to join him. Paine entered all three of the pistol events at the 1896 Games, but actually competed in only one. He, along with his brother Sumner Paine, was disqualified from the rapid fire pistol event for not having the appropriate caliber pistol. Both of the Paines used Colt revolvers, firearms that were far superior to those used by their opponents in the 25 metre military pistol event, John won the event easily, scoring 442 points on 25 hits out of 30 shots, Sumner was not far behind, at 380 points on 23 hits; the third-place finisher, the Greek Nikolaos Morakis, scored only 205 points. Paine then withdrew from the 30 metre free pistol event, citing his desire to not embarrass his Greek hosts, but it also said he had an agreement with his brother, that who ever won the first event between them, they would drop out the next event. After the Olympics, Paine went on to fight in the Spanish\u2013American War before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, and becoming a wealthy investment banker. Paine is also the Great-grandfather to C\u00e8cile Tucker who competed in 1996 Summer Olympics in a rowing event. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Olympic shooters of the United States Category:Shooters at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th- century sportsmen Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in shooting Category:American male sport shooters Category:ISSF pistol shooters Category:Olympic medalists in shooting Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Harvard College alumni ",
