    "text": "Kuiper Systems LLC is a subsidiary of Amazon that was setup in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name \"Project Kuiper\". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation. == History == Amazon announced in April 2019 that they would fund and deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation called \"Project Kuiper\". It is expected to take up to a decade to fully deploy all 3,236 satellites planned for the full constellation in order to provide internet to \"tens of millions of people who lack basic access to broadband internet.\" Amazon has not announced if they intend to sell broadband service directly to consumers, but they will \"offer broadband service through partnerships with other companies.\" In December 2019, information became public that Amazon was asking the FCC to waive requirements (eg. to have applied by 2016) that SpaceX and OneWeb had to follow in order to get their large satellite internet constellations licensed. , the FCC had not yet ruled on the request. SpaceX and others have asked the FCC to reject the waiver request. On July 30th, 2020, Amazon announced that it would be investing more than $10 billion in Project Kuiper, post receiving an authorization from the Federal Communications Commission for a Project Kuiper constellation of 3,236 satellites, to provide broadband internet access across the globe. A condition included in the FCC's authorization was a non- interference clause that required the satellites to not interfere with previously authorized satellite ventures. == Operations == The satellites are projected to use an orbit with a height between . Kuiper is planned to work in concert with Amazon's previously announced large network of 12 satellite ground station facilities (the \"AWS Ground Station unit\") announced in November 2018. Amazon filed communications license documents with the U.S. regulatory authorities the FCC in July 2019, which included information that the wholly owned Amazon subsidiary that intended to deploy the satellite constellation was Kuiper Systems LLC, based in Seattle, Washington. , the Kuiper System is planned to consist of 3,236 satellites operating in 98 orbital planes in three orbital shells, one each at , , and orbital altitude.Amazon lays out constellation service goals, deployment and deorbit plans to FCC, Caleb Henry, SpaceNews, July 8, 2019, accessed September 9, 2019. The Kuiper System includes high-performance satellites, terrestrial gateways, internetworking technologies, and a range of customer terminals.\" The president of Kuiper Systems is Rajeev Badyal, a former vice president of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet constellation. In December 2019, Amazon announced that the team were expected to move headquarters to a larger R&D; facility in Redmond, Washington, in 2020. However, an update continues to remain pending on the final move. == See also == * Amazon * Kuiper belt * OneWeb satellite constellation * SpaceX Starlink == References == Category:Aerospace companies of the United States Category:Amazon (company) Category:Private spaceflight companies Category:Communications satellite constellations Category:Communications satellites in low Earth orbit Category:Satellite Internet access ",
