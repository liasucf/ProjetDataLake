    "text": "St. Pete\u2013Clearwater International Airport is a public/military airport in Pinellas County, Florida serving the Tampa Bay Area. It is right on the northeast municipal boundary of Pinellas Park, north of downtown St. Petersburg, southeast of Clearwater, and southwest of Tampa. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility. In 2014, it showed double-digit growth and handled more than one million passengers, setting a record. Most scheduled airline traffic in the Tampa Bay Area uses Tampa International Airport (TPA), east, but St. Pete\u2013Clearwater remains a destination for low-cost carriers. St. Pete\u2013Clearwater is a focus city for Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air. PIE is also less busy than Tampa, and is frequently used by pilots of private planes and executive jets. The airport uses \"Tampa Bay The Easy Way\" as an advertising slogan and \"Fly2PIE\" in reference to its three-letter IATA and FAA codes. ==History== The airport is on the west shoreline of Tampa Bay, six miles (10 km) north of St. Petersburg, Florida (the \"birthplace of commercial air transportation\"). Barely a decade after the pioneer flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk in 1903, the first tickets for airline travel were sold by the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line of Tony Jannus to fare-paying passengers. Using a Benoist XIV amphibious aircraft, the inaugural flight took place from a location near the downtown St. Petersburg Pier. Mayor Abram C. Pheil of St. Petersburg and Mae Peabody of Dubuque, Iowa, were the first passengers, flying across the bay to Tampa and, according to a United Press account, reportedly reaching the maximum speed of 75 miles per hour during the flight. Other reports indicate that they reached an altitude of . This was the beginning of commercial air transportation anywhere in the world and is commemorated by a replica of the Benoist aircraft and a plaque at the airport terminal baggage claim area. Another replica is displayed at the St. Petersburg Museum of History adjacent to the Pier. Since 1991, the terminal holds the archives of the Florida Aviation Historical Society. ===Construction and wartime=== Construction of the airport at its present site started in March 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the airport was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces, which used it as a military flight training base assigned to Third Air Force. The 304th Fighter Squadron, a combat training unit of the 337th Fighter Group based P-40 Warhawks and, later, P-51 Mustangs at Pinellas Army Airfield (as it was then known) for the duration of World War II. Antisubmarine patrols against German U-boats in the Gulf of Mexico were also flown from the airfield. To commemorate the airport's vital role during that conflict, a plaque was dedicated at the airport terminal in 1994 by the P-51 Fighter Pilots Association and Brigadier General James H. Howard, who was the only European Theater fighter pilot to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II and later served as the last wartime base commander of Pinellas Army Airfield. A permanent exhibit honoring General Howard is located in the terminal. ===Postwar operation=== FAA diagram After World War II, the property was returned to Pinellas County by the U.S. government to operate as a civil airport. It was originally called Pinellas International Airport and given the IATA designation, PIE, which it still uses, because PIA was already taken by Peoria International Airport. In 1958, the name was changed to St. Petersburg\u2013Clearwater International Airport because, according to airport manager \"Bobo\" Hayes, tourists didn't know where Pinellas County was. ===Airline service: 1950s to the mid 2000s=== In the 1950s, several airlines served both PIE and Tampa International Airport, including Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines and Northwest Airlines. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide lists 17 airline departures: ten by Eastern, six by National and one by Mackey Airlines. Four departures flew nonstop beyond Florida, including an Eastern Douglas DC-4 to Chicago and a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation to Pittsburgh. In 1956, Mackey Airlines Douglas DC-4s flew to Nassau, Bahamas via Tampa and Fort Lauderdale.http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 5, 1956 Mackey Airlines timetable In 1959, a National Airlines Douglas DC-7B flew to New York City Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport) and Boston via Jacksonville.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 26, 1959 National Airlines timetable In 1960, Delta was operating \"Flying Scot\" Douglas DC-6s on a St. Petersburg - Atlanta - Knoxville - Cincinnati - Chicago Midway Airport routing.http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 30, 1960 Delta Air Lines timetable With the advent of the jet age, runway 17/35 was extended north into Tampa Bay; the first scheduled jets were Northwest Airlines Boeing 720Bs from Chicago in late 1961 (the 1961 Aviation Week directory says PIE's longest runways were 5,700 feet, but it appears 17/35 was 8,000 feet when the 720B arrived). The increased capacities of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets prompted the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to approve consolidation of airline service for the Tampa Bay area at TPA in the early 1960s. In 1963, Northwest was flying a Lockheed L-188 Electra Miami - Fort Lauderdale - St. Petersburg - Atlanta - Chicago O'Hare Airport - Minneapolis/St. Paul - Fargo, ND - Grand Forks, ND - Winnipeg, Canada.http://www.timetableimages.com, March 1, 1963 Northwest Airlines timetable Eastern was the last scheduled airline at PIE during the mid 1960s and it ended flights from the airport in 1964.
