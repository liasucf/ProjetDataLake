    "text": "Kevin Shields, 1989 Glide guitar is a technique for playing guitar in which the player strums while holding the whammy bar, resulting in a pitch that wavers. It was developed by Irish musician Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine on the band's albums You Made Me Realise (1988) and Isn't Anything (1988). Shields often combined this technique with a reverse reverb effect from a Yamaha SPX90 unit, and would also tune two neighboring strings of his guitar to nearly the same pitch. Shields explained that he \"virtually invent[ed] my own way of playing. It didn't come about in any conscious way. ... It felt playful, but on a much stronger level.\" The technique was later referenced in the title of the group's EP Glider (1990). ==See also== * Dream pop * Shoegazing ==References== ==External links== * Category:Guitar performance techniques Category:Shoegazing Category:My Bloody Valentine (band) ",
