    "text": "The Eugie Foster Memorial Award for Short Fiction is an annual juried award presented to the author of a piece of short speculative fiction (20,000 words or fewer) published during the previous calendar year. It seeks to recognize fiction that is \"irreplacable\" and that \"will become essential to speculative fiction readers.\" The award is named in honour of Eugie Foster, a prolific speculative writer and editor. It was first presented in 2016 at the awards banquet at Dragon Con, and has continued to be presented at the same venue in years since. ==Winners and nominees== In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist. * Winners {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |- ! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year ! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author ! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Work ! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication ! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref. |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| | * || \"The Long Goodnight of Violet Wild\" || Clarkesworld |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Three Cups of Grief, by Starlight\" || Clarkesworld |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"The Deepwater Bride\" || |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Pocosin\" || Apex Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers\" || Nightmare Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| | * || \"The City Born Great\" || Tor.com |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Seasons of Glass and Iron\" || The Starlit Wood |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Ten Poems for the Mossums, One for the Man\" || Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"The Limitless Perspective of Master Peek, or, the Luminescence of Debauchery\" || Beneath Ceaseless Skies |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"You'll Surely Drown Here If You Stay\" || Uncanny Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| | * || \"Clearly Lettered in a Mostly Steady Hand\" || Uncanny Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Infinite Love Engine\" || Lightspeed |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Zen and the Art of Starship Maintenance\" || Cosmic Powers |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"The Last Novelist (or A Dead Lizard in the Yard)\" || Tor.com |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"And Then There Were (N-One)\" || Uncanny Magazine |align=\"center\"| |- |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| | * || \"When We Were Starless\" || Clarkesworld |align=\"center\"| |- | || \u201cThe War of Light and Shadow, in Five Dishes\" || Beneath Ceaseless Skies |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"A Witch's Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies\" || Apex |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Barleycorn\" || Abyss & Apex |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"The Heart of Owl Abbas\" || Tor.com |align=\"center\"| |- |- style=\"background:;\" !scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| | || \"For He Can Creep\" || Tor.com |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"The House Wins in the End\" || The Dark |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Love in the Time of Immuno-Sharing\" || Analog |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"A Civilization Dreams of Absolutely Nothing\" || Analog |align=\"center\"| |- | || \"Postlude to the Afternoon of a Faun\" || The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction |align=\"center\"| |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Official Website Category:Awards established in 2016 Category:Lists of speculative fiction-related award winners and nominees Category:Science fiction awards Category:Short story awards E ",
