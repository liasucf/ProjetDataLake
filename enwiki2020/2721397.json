The paper is based in London and is published every Thursday. ==History== The Voice was founded in 1982 by Val McCalla, who, while working on a London local paper called the East End News in 1981, led a group of businessmen and journalists in a new and uncertain endeavour \u2013 the creation of a weekly newspaper to cater for the interests of British-born Afro-Caribbean people. Until then the Afro-Caribbean press in Britain had always addressed a generation of immigrants, relaying news from their countries of origin in the Caribbean and Africa. Publications were named accordingly, with titles such as the West Indian Gazette, West Indian World, The Caribbean Times and West Africa. According to Beulah Ainley, who worked with McCalla on the East End News, \"nobody thought the Voice would work\",Andy Beckett, \"The Voice in the Wilderness\", The Independent, 11 February 1996. however, as The Independent has noted: \"The previous summer, Brixton had rioted, and Afro-caribbean enterprises of all kinds were now being encouraged in the hope of preventing a repetition. London's councils, in particular, were keen to advertise for black staff, and even keener to do so in an Afro- Caribbean newspaper. McCalla also had a business partner, Alex Pascall, with BBC connections; soon the Corporation was advertising too.\" The Voice got off the ground with a \u00a362,000 loan from Barclays Bank. At a time when Afro- Caribbean businesses found it particularly hard to get backing from banks, The Voice was helped by two factors. One was Barclays' desire to show support for Afro-Caribbean causes, to counteract the adverse publicity attracted by their investments in South Africa, for which the bank had been boycotted by the anti-apartheid movement.Lionel Morrison, A Century of Black Journalism in Britain: A Kaleidoscopic View of Race and the Media (1893-2003), Truebay Limited, March 2007, p. 64. The other was the existence of the Loan Guarantee Scheme, set up by the Conservative government as part of Margaret Thatcher's policy of aiding and encouraging the growth of small businesses in Britain. Under the Loan Guarantee Scheme the Government secured 80% of the loan, thereby reducing the risk taken by the bank. As it turned out, the loan was fully paid off within five years. The first issue of The Voice was printed to coincide with the Notting Hill Carnival in August 1982. Its cover price was 54 pence, and was only sold in London. The Voice\u2032s first office was in Mare Street, Hackney, East London.\"City Hall Hosts Voice Newspaper Exhibition\", The Voice, 19 October 2017. The newspaper's first editor, Flip Fraser,Elizabeth Pears, \"Black Hero Flip Fraser Joins The Hall Of Fame\", The Gleaner, 7 September 2014. led a team of young journalists who set about addressing the issues that mattered to Britain's Afro-Caribbean community. They laid the foundation for the future success of the paper, combining human-interest stories and coverage of sports, fashion and entertainment with hard news and investigative reporting. Within two decades it had become \"Britain's most successful Afro-caribbean newspaper\". In 1996, The Voice fought off a challenge from the New Nation, which sought to position itself as an \"upbeat, aspirational publication\", rather than the typically \"advocacy journalism\" contained within The Voice.{Decca Aitkenhead, \"Black and successful? Here's the good news\", The Independent, 13 October 1996. New Nation published its final online issue on 17 February 2016.http://www.newnation.co.uk/ The paper is also circulated in British prisons to black prisoners.. ===2004 takeover=== Two years after the death of McCalla in 2002, ownership of the newspaper was taken over by the Jamaican Gleaner Company.Chris Tryhorn, \"Voice sold off in \u00a34m deal\", MediaGuardian, The Guardian, 20 May 2004.Chris Tryhorn, \"Gleaner group acquires the Voice\", The Guardian, 21 May 2004.

At the launch of the New Nation newspaper, the paper's editor, Richard Adeshiyan, referred to The Voice as a \"doom-and- gloom sheet\" which prints damaging images of blacks as victims. On 30 July 2020, The Voice received widespread criticism for publishing an interview with rapper Wiley shortly after he posted a series of anti-Semitic comments on social media. Rather than challenging Wiley on his comments, the interview asked Wiley if he felt he made any \"salient points\". This received widespread criticism from many Jewish leaders, with music producer Mark Ronson tweeting a series of comments criticising the publication.. On 31 July, the article was removed, with The Voice issuing a statement apologising for any offence caused by the article. ==See also== * List of newspapers in the United Kingdom * New Nation ==References== ==External links== * The Voice Online * Young Voices * The Gleaner Company Limited. * Decca Aitkenhead, \"Black and successful?
