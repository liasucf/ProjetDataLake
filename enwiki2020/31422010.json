    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Folk Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the folk genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\". According to the 54th Grammy Awards guideline the Best Folk Album category includes authentic folk material in both traditional vocal and instrumental styles, as well as contemporary material by artists who use traditional folk elements, sounds and instrumental techniques as the basis for their recordings. Folk music is primarily but not exclusively acoustic, often using contemporary arrangements with production and sensibilities distinctly different from a pop approach. This award combines the previous categories for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Traditional Folk Album. The Recording Academy decided to create this new category for 2012 upon stating there were \"challenges in distinguishing between... Contemporary and Traditional Folk\". == Recipients == The Civil Wars are the inaugural winners of the award 2019 recipient Patty Griffin {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist(s) ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Title ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Other Nominees ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref. |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|2012 | The Civil Wars | Barton Hollow | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013 | Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer & Chris Thile | The Goat Rodeo Sessions | | style=\"text-align:center;\"|List of 2013 nominees |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014 | Guy Clark | My Favorite Picture of You | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015 | Old Crow Medicine Show | Remedy | | style=\"text-align:center;\"|List of Nominees 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016 | B\u00e9la Fleck & Abigail Washburn | B\u00e9la Fleck & Abigail Washburn | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017 | Sarah Jarosz | Undercurrent | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018 | Aimee Mann | Mental Illness | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019 | Punch Brothers | All Ashore | {{smalldiv| * Joan Baez \u2013 Whistle Down The Wind * Dom Flemons \u2013 Black Cowboys * Mary Gauthier \u2013 Rifles & Rosary Beads * Iron & Wine \u2013 Weed Garden | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Grammy.com, 7 December 2018} |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2020 | Patty Griffin | Patty Griffin | {{smalldiv| * Gregory Alan Isakov \u2014 Evening Machines * Joy Williams \u2014 Front Porch * Andrew Bird \u2014 My Finest Work Yet * Che Apalache \u2014 Rearrange My Heart | |- |} Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year. ==Artists with multiple nominations== ;3 nominations * Rhiannon Giddens (one as a member The Carolina Chocolate Drops) ;2 nominations * Dom Flemons (one as a member of The Carolina Chocolate Drops) * Patty Griffin * Sarah Jarosz * Chris Thile * Joy Williams (one as a member of The Civil Wars) ==See also== List of Grammy Award categories ==References== == External links == * Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Grammy Awards for folk music Folk Album ",
