A \"Portland\" sign was displayed when the venue was originally known as Portland Publix Theatre, which opened in March 1928.Erickson, Steve (September 5, 1984). \"Arts center displays new sign\". The Oregonian, p. B1. In 1930, the theater's owners secured a contract to show Paramount films, and changed the name of their business to the Paramount Theatre. Accordingly, the sign's lettering, but not its overall design, was changed to \"Paramount\". A one-year, $10 million renovation of the building began in September 1983, after the city of Portland acquired it. In connection with that work, the landmark 65-foot- tall \"Paramount\" sign was removed on March 18, 1984, to be used by Ballard Sign Company of Salem as a model for a new replica which would restore the \"Portland\" wording that the sign had used originally. The new replica sign, with neon letters five feet tall, was attached to the building on September 4, 1984. The theatre re-opened four days later. In May 2017, the sign began a two-month, $500,000 renovation, which would include a fresh coat of paint and brighter neon letters. It was removed from the building in early May and taken off-site for the work, which was funded by Metro (the operator of the Schnitzer Concert Hall). Reassembly of the sign was to be completed in mid- August, with a re-lighting ceremony on August 16. ==See also== * Hung Far Low (restaurant), \"Chop Suey Hung Far Low Cocktails\" sign * White Stag sign ==References== ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Portland, Oregon Category:Individual signs in the United States Category:Landmarks in Oregon Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon ",
