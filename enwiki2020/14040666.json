    "text": "The SNCF 4-240A class and SNCF 5-240P class was a group of 37 (12 + 25) 4-8-0 steam locomotives designed by Andr\u00e9 Chapelon, and regarded by some, as one of his best designs. They started life as Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans (Paris-Orleans Railway) 4500 class 4-6-2s before being rebuilt. The new boiler with the long, narrow Belpaire firebox came from the Nord \"Super Pacifics\". With all the pipes, domes, and pumps, these were double-chimneyed, husky looking locomotives of very different appearance than the Pacifics. ==Use== A later SNCF 5-240P. These had the larger bogie tenders and longer smoke deflectors. === 4-240A === SNCF south-west. These 12 4-8-0s were created to tackle the 1:100 gradients of the Brive to Montauban division of the line from Paris to Toulouse, steeper than those to Bordeaux. The intention was to provide one-third more adhesive weight than the 4500s. On level ground, they could manage 28 coaches at . === 5-240P === SNCF south-east. These 25 4-8-0s were created by 1940 to tackle the 1:125 gradient of the Les Laumes to Dijon division of the line from Paris to Lyon. Used in passenger and fast freight services between Paris and Lyon. Withdrawn by 1950 with the electrification of the Paris - Dijon section. These later locomotives had mechanical stokers and bogie tenders. ==References== * * * Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1940 Category:2\u2032D h4v locomotives Category:4-8-0 locomotives 240P 240P Category:Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of France Category:Scrapped locomotives ",
