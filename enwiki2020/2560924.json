    "text": "Ituni is a town in the interior of Guyana, at an altitude of 100 metres (331 feet). Bauxite mining is the main industry. In 1946, a railway line opened between Ituni and Mackenzie. Even though the line was for mining operations, irregular passenger trains continued until 1982. The railway line has been replaced by trucks, however most of the track is still in place. ==References== Category:Populated places in Upper Demerara-Berbice ",
