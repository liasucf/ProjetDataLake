    "text": "Underneath is the third album by American pop rock group Hanson. It was released in 2004 by 3CG Records. It is the band's first release on their own independent record label. The making of the album was the main subject in Hanson's documentary film, Strong Enough to Break, that follows the band during the recording process and the struggles they faced to release it. ==Worldwide sales== To date, the album has sold more than 350,000 copies, 137,000 of which were US sales and around 17,000 of which were sold in the UK, making this their lowest-selling official release. Despite this, the lead single \"Penny & Me\" achieved some success, reaching number 2 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart and number 10 on the UK Top 40. The second single, \"Lost Without Each Other\", did not chart in most countries, and only reached number 39 on the UK Top 40. Hanson themselves have said that they endured a financial loss in making and releasing the album, to the point where in some places, the album itself transitioned from mainstream retail locations to discount stores, particularly across England. It has been speculated that any loss endured has been made up from tour proceeds, as they tend to generate more direct income for bands than record sales can. ==Track listing== All songs written by Isaac Hanson, Taylor Hanson and Zac Hanson; additional writers in parentheses.
