    "text": "Richard John Sinclair Laws, CBE (born 8 August 1935), also known as Lawsie, was from the 1970s until his retirement in 2007, the host of an Australian morning radio program combining music with interviews, opinion, live advertising readings and listener talkback. His distinctive voice earned him the nickname \"the Golden Tonsils\". Despite retiring in 2007, Laws' management confirmed in November 2010 that he would be returning to radio in February 2011, as the host of a morning programme on 2SM and the Super Radio Network. == Career == Laws' radio show was syndicated throughout Australia for many years and was consistently one of the most popular and influential programs in the Australian media. Laws is also a familiar voice for generations of Australians through his large and varied body of work as a voice-over artist for commercials, and as a celebrity endorser of commercial products, notably Valvoline motor oil, with his popular catchphrase \"Valvoline, you know what I mean\" and Oral-B toothbrushes (the slogan \"Oral-B, the toothbrush more dentists use.\") Laws was on Australian talk radio longer than any other broadcaster and as a result of his popularity, for many years he has been cited as Australia's highest-paid radio personality. Although he commented regularly on topical news, Laws did not consider himself a journalist, saying he considered himself foremost to be an entertainer and salesman. Laws had become one of the most influential media personalities in Australia over the last three decades, and one of the few commercial radio personalities whose interviews with state and federal political leaders are considered to have a significant influence of the course of politics in New South Wales especially, and Australia in general. == Biography == Born in Wau, Papua New Guinea to Australian parents, Laws contracted polio twice \u2013 once as a child, and again as a young man. Laws was educated at Mosman Preparatory School and Knox Grammar School in Sydney, Australia. He began his radio career in 1953 at 3BO in Bendigo before working at several rural radio stations prior to joining 2UE in 1957, the first of four terms at that Sydney radio station, during which time Laws (along with Bob Rogers, Tony Withers and Stan Rofe) became prominent as one of the first Australian disc jockeys to play rock'n'roll music. Laws is said to have pioneered the practice (soon taken up by Rofe) of using contacts in the airline industry to supply him with the latest pop releases from overseas, a facility which gave him an edge at a time when many pop records were not released in Australia until weeks or even months after being issued overseas. Laws left 2UE two years later, and moved for a time to the Hunter Region, where he ran a farm. In 1962 he moved back to Sydney, where he joined 2GB, remaining with the station for two years before he rejoined 2UE in 1964. His stint at 2UE continued until 1969, at which point Laws joined 2UW's line- up and remained there for 10 years. He returned to 2UE in 1979, this time for another five years. He then moved to 2GB after a highly publicised bid for his services, but returned to the 2UE fold when the station was number eight in the ratings. The return of Laws was the primary cause of the station then being number one in Sydney for many years. Laws' radio program was syndicated nationwide, with it especially popular in rural areas. Capital city stations taking Laws include 4BC in Brisbane, 2CC in Canberra, 101.7 HOFM in Hobart and Mix 1049 in Darwin. 1998 saw Laws make the move to television, with John Laws \u2013 In One Lifetime on Network Ten and LAWS on Foxtel. While LAWS continued until 2000, John Laws \u2013 In One Lifetime was dropped after two episodes \u2013 although the remaining five episodes that were commissioned by Network 10 were aired later that year. However, his appeal began to wane. In 2002, station colleague and arch-rival Alan Jones moved from 2UE to 2GB, and soon took that station to the top talk position in Sydney. Laws also has recorded numerous albums (mostly of Australian country music), and has written several best- selling books. === Retirement announcement=== After 55 years on air, Laws announced on 25 June 2007 that he would retire at the end of the year. However, he was pre-empted by other media agencies, who broke the story at 9:00 am. Laws made the announcement at about 9:10 am, saying that he had planned to make the announcement at about 9:45 am. Laws' last broadcast was on 30 November 2007, one week after the federal election. He began as always, \"Hello world, I'm John Laws\" and signed off with his usual quote, \"you...be kind to each other.\" He then left the 2UE building in Sydney in his distinctive Rolls Royce Phantom surrounded by hordes of cameramen. In August 2009, Laws revealed on Vega (now known as Smooth FM) that he missed radio and that he was interested in returning to the airwaves. This was followed five months later by an announcement by Laws' manager, revealing that Laws had entered into negotiations with a number of radio stations, including 2SM. Nevertheless, the suggestions that Laws would be returning from retirement in 2010 ended shortly thereafter, when 2UE management revealed that their contract with Laws precluded him from competing with their station until December 2010. === Return to radio === Laws' management confirmed in November 2010 that he would be returning to radio, following the expiry of the no- compete clause that prevented him from signing with a new network. He currently presents the John Laws Morning Show on 2SM and the Super Radio Network. ==Incidents== ===Cash for comment scandal=== In 2004, both Laws and rival talk-back host Alan Jones (now at 2GB) were accused of cash for comment, after entering into deals with Telstra. The ABA subsequently found that Laws' deal constituted cash for comment but Jones' did not. Laws, apparently angered by what he saw as inequitable treatment, launched stinging attacks on Jones and the ABA's head, David Flint. In an appearance on the ABC's Enough Rope, Laws accused Jones of placing pressure on Prime Minister John Howard to keep Flint as head of the ABA, made comments that many viewers took to imply a sexual relationship between Jones and Flint, and broadly hinted that Jones, like Flint, was homosexual. On 7 May 2009 Laws made a statement on the 20th anniversary special edition of the ABC's Media Watch program, in which he exhibited no remorse for his role in the Cash-for-Comment scandal, instead implying that the whistleblower (Media Watch) was the wrongdoer and that the people involved were only jealous of his success. ===Comments about homosexuals and Chinese drivers=== In November 2004, Laws and 2UE colleague Steve Price were found guilty of vilifying homosexuals after an on-air discussion about a gay couple appearing in the reality TV show The Block. They described the gay couple as \"young poofs\". Laws had previously apologised for another incident in which he called gay TV personality Carson Kressley, of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy fame, a \"pillow-biter\" and a \"pompous little pansy prig\". In August 2007, Laws was again embroiled in controversy after suggesting on-air that \"Chinese drivers are probably the worst drivers on the face of the earth.\" He denied that he was a racist. ===Defamation lawsuit=== In October 2007, West Coast Eagles player Adam Selwood commenced legal proceedings against Laws over comments made about him regarding a mid-year incident involving Fremantle Football Club player Des Headland. ===Incident with Derryn Hinch=== In December 2007, during a long lunch at Sydney's Otto Ristorante to farewell his former personal assistant, he was informed of the presence of rival broadcasters Derryn Hinch and Bob Rogers at another table nearby. Laws went over to their table and immediately began to spout forth a tirade of invective, calling them 'the two most despicable cunts' he'd ever met in the industry. Hinch and Rogers traded insults with Laws, insisting Hinch was a 'hypocrite' and a 'failed alcoholic'. Hinch replied that that must mean Laws was a 'successful one' and that if Laws was not in fact an alcoholic then he was a 'bloody good actor'. Eventually 2UE colleague Mike Carlton convinced Laws to return to his table at the Otto and Hinch and Rogers were left to laugh off the altercation. ===Interviews with sexual abuse victims=== On 19 March 2013 Laws interviewed a female listener, who described a history of sexual abuse between the ages of six and sixteen. Laws proceeded to ask the woman if the abuse was in some way her fault and whether she had been provocative. The following day Laws said on air that women who dressed provocatively were once viewed as \"rape bait\". In 2015, Laws referred to a male victim of child sexual assault as a \"wet blanket\" and told him to \"brighten up\". == Cultural influence == In 1996 a portrait of John Laws by artist Paul Newton won the Packing Room award at the Archibald Prize. The portrait was hung in Laws' production office at 2UE. Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating called him the \"broadcaster of the century\" at Laws 40th anniversary dinner. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is mentioned in the song \"Who Can Stand in the Way?\" by Australian group Midnight Oil on their album Red Sails in the Sunset. == Golden microphone stolen == On 17 July 2007 the gold-plated microphone was stolen. The Sennheiser was presented to him by his radio station 2UE management in 2003 to commemorate his 50 years on the air and is said to be worth $10,000. \"I'm very upset about it \u2013 it's been a part of my life\" he told the Daily Telegraph. Laws subsequently switched to another gold plated microphone; a Rode NT2-A presented to him for his 40th anniversary and has promised charges will not be laid if the Sennheiser is returned. ==Filmography== *Ned Kelly (1970) \u2013 Kennedy *Nickel Queen (1971) - Claude Fitzherbert *The Magic Pudding (2000) \u2013 Rumpus Bumpus ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with Australian chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS |- ! scope=\"row\" | Rollin' Free | * Released: 1971 * Format: LP * Label: His Master's Voice (SOELP-9765) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | Motivatin' Man | * Released: 1971 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (SL-101975) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | Rocks in M' Pocket and Dirt in M' Shoes | * Released: August 1972 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (SP-114-G) | align=\"center\" | 25 |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Mind and the Music | * Released: 1973 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (SP-125-G) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | Let Him Roll | * Released: 1975 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (SP-154-G) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | You've Never Been Trucked Like This Before | * Released: July 1976 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (VPL1-0121) | align=\"center\" | 69 |- ! scope=\"row\" | In Love Is an Expensive Place to Die | * Released: 1976 * Format: LP * Label: Ultimat (ULP-2002) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | You Must Remember This | * Released: August 1977 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Victor (VPL1-0147) | align=\"center\" | 91 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Just You and Me Together Love (with Henry Mancini) | * Released: 1977 * Format: LP * Label: RCA (PL 12362) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | A Tribute to the ANZACS | * Released: 2000 * Format: CD * Label: Southland Music Distribution (SLM736CD) | align=\"center\" | - |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with Australian chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS |- ! scope=\"row\" | John Laws | * Released: 1973 * Format: LP * Label: RCA Australia (VCL1-0029) | align=\"center\" | - |- ! scope=\"row\" | For No Reason At All | * Released: June 1981 * Format: LP * Label: J&B; Records (JB074) | align=\"center\" | 95 |- ! scope=\"row\" | For No Reason At All | * Released: June 1981 * Format: LP * Label: J&B; Records (JB074) | align=\"center\" | 95 |} ===Charting singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of singles, with Australian chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:32em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS |- | 1972 ! scope=\"row\" | \"No Name\"/\"Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 37 |- | 1975 ! scope=\"row\" | \"And Yet and Yet\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 99 |} == References == == External links == * Radio 2UE's archive of John Laws' retirement announcement and noteworthy tributes * Media Watch analysis of the 1999\u20132000 'cash for comment' inquiry * Media Watch on the Telstra deals * Sydney Morning Herald report on vilification finding Category:ARIA Award winners Category:Australian radio presenters Category:Australian talk radio hosts Category:Australian television presenters Category:People from Sydney Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Network 10 Category:Shock jocks Category:People educated at Knox Grammar School Category:People from Morobe Province Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:People with polio Category:Australian car collectors Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian country singers Category:Former 2GB presenters ",
