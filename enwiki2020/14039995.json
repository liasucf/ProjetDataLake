In war counsels during the 1776 defense of New York City, Read urged the evacuation of the American fortifications, dissenting from generals such as Nathanael Greene who urged that the forts be defended. ==Read/Reed family== His brother was Lt. Colonel Seth Read, who commanded the Massachusetts 26th and 15th regiments and founded Erie, Pennsylvania. The Read brothers owned half of the land in the towns of Uxbridge and Northbridge, Massachusetts, in the mid 18th century. The family is known as \"Reed\" in Pennsylvania, and the Read name and spelling continued in Massachusetts. At some point after the revolution, Joseph Read moved to Brookfield, Massachusetts, where he died in 1801. He and his wife Eunice are buried in Brookfield.
