Aguinaldo, Gen. Araneta, and Gen. McArthur Avenues, primarily for BPO/IT office development. The development sits on a jeepney terminal servicing areas around Quezon City and the Province of Rizal, and the private Araneta White House (Bahay na Puti) complex. It also sits on the former lot occupied by Fiesta Carnival, a amusement park formerly occupying the Shopwise Hypermarket complex. As the carnival declined in the 1990s due to mall-based entertainment and other technological shifts, the Araneta Group decided to move the carnival into an open lot located in the south west corner lot of the complex, across SM Cubao. Unfortunately, the outdoor complex did not click the public and was completely closed down years later. https://www.theurbanroamer.com/reminiscing-cubao-the-fiesta-carnival/ The first master plan of the Cyberpark, which was completed on 2008, is composed of 7 low-rise buildings, housed by Telus, APAC, AGS, Agentworx, and Expert Global Solutions. As demand for office spaces grew and expanded over the years, along with the country's stable growing economy, a newer and updated master plan was finalised, consisting of 5 PEZA certified and LEED-approved towers, with 2 levels of retail (initially 5), surrounding an outdoor park, and connected to malls and nearby buildings such as SM Cubao, Ali Mall, the Manhattan Gardens condominiums, the Araneta Coliseum, the New Frontier Theater, the Novotel Manila Araneta City and the upcoming Ibis Styles Araneta City.
