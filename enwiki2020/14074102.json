Falero has had phases nodding to more recent influential art movements of the twentieth century - such as Pop Art (i.e. Andy Warhol, George Segal), Surrealism, Modernism, and Postmodernism - while incorporating Latin American elements and other flourishes to reflect his Cuban background. Art historian Dr. Lynette Bosch of the State University of New York says of Falero: \"By drawing on imagery taken from a range of artistic styles and eras, he has blended the separate parts of his life into a united reality that reflects his diverse experience and faith.\" ==Exhibitions== ===Individual exhibitions=== His most relevant solo shows include a 1974 exhibit at Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, D.C.; a 1974 exhibition at the Permuy Gallery in Coral Gables that led to a subsequent 1976 solo exhibition; a 1979 solo exhibit titled Emilio Falero.
