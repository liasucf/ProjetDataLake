In the early years, it had no office and no publication. In 1945 and 1946, USCF Annual books were published. In 1946, publication of Chess Life started as a bi-weekly newspaper, usually eight or twelve pages long. In 1961, Frank Brady converted Chess Life to a slick-covered magazine. In 1969, Chess Life merged with Chess Review, the other leading U.S. chess magazine. The magazine was published under the title Chess Life & Review starting with the November 1969 issue until 1980 when it returned to the name Chess Life. ==Editors of Chess Life== * 05/1946\u201312/1957 Montgomery Major * 01/1958-12/1960 Fred M.
