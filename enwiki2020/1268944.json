    "text": "George Augustus Selwyn was the first bishop of New Zealand. The Primate of New Zealand is the leading bishop of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia. Since 2006, the Senior Bishop of each tikanga (M\u0101ori, P\u0101keh\u0101, Pasefika) serves automatically as one of three co-equal Primates-and- Archbishops. Previously, one of these three would be Presiding Bishop and the other two Co-Presiding Bishops; and before that there was only one Primate. ==Bishop and Metropolitan== George Selwyn was consecrated Bishop of New Zealand on 17 October 1841: he was the sole bishop over a very large territory, including all New Zealand and very many South Pacific islands. In his lifetime, as the Anglican ministry in New Zealand grew, that one diocese was divided several times: by letters patent dated 22 September 1858, (Series: Letters patent and other papers) Selwyn was made metropolitan bishop over the other dioceses and called Bishop of New Zealand and Metropolitan.First General Synod of the Branch of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand (p. 78, online at the Kinder Library)http://www.anglican.org.nz/Directory/Primates By 1868, New Zealand had seven dioceses, Selwyn had come to be referred to as \"the Primate\", and the General Synod constitution as amended that year used this term.Proceedings of the Fourth General Synod of the Branch of the United Church of England and Ireland in New Zealand (p. 21, online at the Kinder Library) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Metropolitan of New Zealand |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1858 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1869 | George Selwyn | |} ==Primate and Metropolitan== At the same Synod, Selwyn having announced his intention to resign, a Statute was adopted for the election of the Primate (and Metropolitan) from among the bishops diocesan (who retained their See) and Harper, Bishop of Christchurch was so elected (to take office upon Selwyn's resignation). The same statute created the role of Senior Bishop \u2014 being the bishop consecrated first (excluding any former primate), and Acting Primate in certain circumstances.Proceedings of the Fourth General Synod: *Final reading of the statue: pp. 32\u2013 33 *Election of the primate: p. 38 *Statute no. 6: pp. 40\u201343 Primates of this era occasionally used the style Archbishop of New Zealand; and gained the archiepiscopal style the Most Reverend between the 5th General Synod (1871)https://kinderlibrary.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/6#idx680 and the 6th (1874).https://kinderlibrary.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/7#idx901 An attempt was made in the 21st Synod (1919) to make the Bishop of Wellington ex officio Primate and Metropolitan;https://kinderlibrary.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/22#idx6177 this failed in the 22nd Synod (1922),Proceedings of the Twenty-Second General Synod of the Church of the Province of New Zealand (p. 20, online at the Kinder Library) which did, however, amend the Canons and officially grant the title Primate and Archbishop of New Zealand.Proceedings of the Twenty-Second General Synod (p. 74) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Primates of New Zealand |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1869 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1890 | Henry Harper | Bishop of Christchurch, 1856\u20131890 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1890 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1893 | Octavius Hadfield | Bishop of Wellington, 1870\u20131893 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1893 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1902 | William Cowie | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1904 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1919 | Samuel Nevill | |} ==Primate and Archbishop== Throughout the 20th century, the church in New Zealand developed an understanding for the different cultures within it. In 1925, the Diocese of Polynesia began as a missionary diocese of the church. In 1928, the first Bishop of Aotearoa, ministering to the M\u0101ori, was consecrated as suffragan bishop to the Bishop of Waiapu. In the 1970s, Melanesia became a separate ecclesiastical province from New Zealand, and the Bishop of Aotearoa became a full-ranking diocesan, with a diocese covering all of New Zealand. Under the primacy of Brian Davis, Polynesia became a fully-fledged diocese and a review of church structures was begun. In 1992, the General Synod of the church set up five hui amorangi, or regional bishoprics, to serve under the Bishop of Aotearoa. The Church of the Province of New Zealand also adopted its current name, the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, to demonstrate its ownership by the three tikanga.Proceedings of the Special Session of the Forty-Ninth General Synod \u2014 Te H\u012bnota Wh\u0101nui & Proceedings of the Fiftieth General Synod \u2014 Te H\u012bnota Wh\u0101nui (online at the Kinder Library) The same Synod limited the Primate to a ten-year term, with re-election to one further four-year term.Proceedings of the Fiftieth General Synod \u2014 Te H\u012bnota Wh\u0101nui (p. 245) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Primates and Archbishops of New Zealand |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1922 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1925 | Churchill Julius | Bishop of Christchurch, 1890\u20131925 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1925 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1940 | Alfred Averill | Bishop of Auckland, 1914\u20131940 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 1940 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1951 | Campbell West- Watson | Bishop of Christchurch, 1926\u20131951 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1952 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1960 | Reginald Owen | Bishop of Wellington, 1947\u20131960 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1961 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1971 | Norman Lesser | Bishop of Waiapu, 1947\u20131971 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1972 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1980 | Allen Johnston | Bishop of Waikato, 1969\u20131980 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1980 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1985 | Paul Reeves | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1986 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1997 | Brian Davis | Bishop of Wellington, 1986\u20131997 |} ==Primate with Co-Presiding Bishops== The 53rd General Synod (1998) reduced the Primate's term from five General Synods (i.e. 10 years) to three (i.e. 6 years); removed the additional style \"Archbishop\" from the Primacy in favour of \"Presiding Bishop\"; and conferred the style \"Co-Presiding Bishops / nga P\u012bhopa Aporei\" on the Senior Bishops of the two tikanga besides the Primate's, while enjoining them to work closely with the Primate / te P\u012bhopa M\u0101t\u0101mua and Presiding Bishop.Proceedings of the Fifty-Third General Synod / H\u012bnota Wh\u0101nui (S-8) The 2004 General Synod passed a further Primacy statuteProceedings of the Fifty-Sixth General Synod / H\u012bnota Wh\u0101nui (S-1\u20133) which: reinstated the honorific \"Archbishop\" (removing \"Presiding Bishop\") to the Primate; required the elected Primate to resign their other See(s); and, anticipating the coming changes, limited the next Primate's term to two years (renewable once). Whakahuihui Vercoe duly stepped down at the end of that two- year term as Primate in 2006, when the church decided that three bishops shall share the position and style of archbishop, each representing one of the three tikanga, or cultural streams of the church: Te P\u012bhopatanga o Aotearoa (the Bishopric of Aotearoa, serving M\u0101ori), the Dioceses in New Zealand (serving P\u0101keh\u0101), and the Diocese of Polynesia. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Primates / P\u012bhopa M\u0101t\u0101mua |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1998 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2004 | John Paterson | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2004 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | Whakahuihui Vercoe | |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Co-Presiding Bishops / P\u012bhopa Aporei |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1998 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | Jabez Bryce | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 1998 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2004 | Whakahuihui Vercoe | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 2004 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | George Connor | |} ==Shared Primacy== Further changes to the office of primate were its limitation to a two-year term, to allow for greater participation in leadership, and its establishment as a triumvirate of bishops. For the transitional period between the decision at 2006 General Synod and the completion of the necessary legislation, Turei was Primate and Archbishop, and Moxon and Bryce his Co-Presiding Bishops; but they began to act as if co-equal primates, including use of \"Archbishop\" and the Most Reverend. Since 2008, Te P\u012bhopa o Aotearoa, the diocesan Bishop of Polynesia and the Senior Bishop of the New Zealand (i.e. tikanga P\u0101keh\u0101) Dioceses have each \u2014 co-equally \u2014 been ex officio Primate and Archbishop; each one is elected by a body representing their whole tikanga.Anglican Diocese of Waikato and Taranaki \u2013 Meet the Bishops (Accessed 5 July 2013) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Primates / P\u012bhopa M\u0101t\u0101mua |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2017 | Brown Turei | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 2006 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2010 | Jabez Bryce | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | April 2013Anglican Communion News Service \u2013 Williams names Moxon to Holy See (accessed 4 December 2012) | David Moxon | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2010 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2018 | Winston Halapua | Bishop of Polynesia, 2010\u20132018 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1 May 2013Anglican Taonga \u2013 New Archbishop 'a community visionary' (Accessed 5 July 2013) | style=\"text-align: center;\" | present | Philip Richardson | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8 April 2018 | style=\"text- align: center;\" | present | Don Tamihere | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2019 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | present | Fereimi Cama | Bishop of Polynesia since 2019 |} ==References== *Anglican church 2005\u20132006 clerical directory (PDF) page 4 *Holy Trinity Cathedral list ==External links== *The official website of Anglican Church in Aotearoa *Historical documents on Anglicanism in New Zealand Category:Anglicanism in New Zealand ",
