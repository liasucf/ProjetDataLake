    "text": "Clubul Sportiv Or\u0103\u0219enesc Plopeni, commonly known as CSO Plopeni, or simply as Plopeni, is a Romanian amateur football club based in Plopeni, Prahova County. The club was originally established in 1947 under the name of Metalul Plopeni. Metalul merged with Rapid Mizil in 1967, was enrolled directly in the third tier and was for decades a constant presence at the level of Liga II and Liga III. In 2004 the club was dissolved due to financial difficulties and re- established only in 2006, after two years of inactivity, this time under the name of Intersport Plopeni. Despite its good financial conditions for the fourth level, Intersport failed to promote in the next three years, then in 2009 the football club was included as a section of the multi-sport entity CSO Plopeni. Intersport was renamed as CSO Plopeni and promoted back to Liga III after only one year. In the third season after promotion, CSO Plopeni withdrew due to financial problems and enrolled in the Liga IV, where is currently playing. ==History== ===Metalul Plopeni (1947\u20132004)=== CSO Plopeni was established in 1947 under the name of Metalul Plopeni and played for 20 years only at county level, fourth tier. In the summer of 1967, third tier side Rapid Mizil merged with Metalul Plopeni, the new formed entity was named Rapid Plopeni and continued the legacy of the football club based in Plopeni, but at the level of Divizia C. In the summer of 1968, after a first season ended on the 4th place, Rapid Plopeni was renamed as Metalul Plopeni and won its Divizia C series at the end of the season, but failed to promote in the Divizia B, after it was ranked only 3rd in a promotion play-off group consisting of Metalul T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, \u0218tiin\u021ba Bac\u0103u and IMU Medgidia. Next season, Metalul won again its series, but failed to promoted for the second consecutive year, after a new 3rd rank in the promotion play-off group, this time a group consisting of \u0218N Olteni\u021ba, CFR Pa\u0219cani and Autobuzul Bucure\u0219ti. Metalul Plopeni in Syria (summer of 1980). Metalul Plopeni finally promoted in the summer of 1971, after obtaining again the best ranking in its series with nine points ahead the second place, \u0218oimii Buz\u0103u. \"The Metal Workers\" remained a constant presence at the level of the second tier for the next decade, period in which were ranked as follows: 8th (1971\u201372 and 1972\u201373), 4th (1973\u201374, 1976\u201377 and 1979\u201380), 6th (1974\u201375), 12th (1975\u201376 and 1980\u201381) and 3rd (1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379). The two third places obtained in 1978 and 1979 will be the best performance in the history of the club from Prahova County. Metalul relegated to Divizia C at the end of 1981\u201382 edition, as a result of the weakest rank obtained in the second tier, 16th place. The period between 1978 and 1981 was by far the most fruitful in the history of the team based in Plopeni, apart from the best performances, Metalul had a very stable financial situation. Plopenarii were allowed by the communists to take part in training camps abroad, thing that was very rare in that period, especially for a second-tier team. Metalul played matches in Cuba, Libya and Syria, sometimes even in front of 50,000 people. In that period for Metalul also played Marian Spiridion, nicknamed \"Jair\", Divizia B all-time goalscorer. In the squad were also players such as Ghi\u021bescu, \u0218tefan, Dobrescu, Gruber, Anghelescu, Istr\u0103tescu, Savu, Andrei, Florea, Negoi\u021b\u0103, Roman or Mocanu and manager was the famous Virgil Dridea. Prahovenii promoted back after only a season spent in the third tier, but this time they had a spell of only three years in the second division, with no notable results. Subsequently, Metalul proven that it was a team too strong for the third tier, but not enough prepared for the second one, promoting back in the summer of 1987, but relegating again in 1989. After this relegation, the team based in Plopeni remained in the third tier until 1993, period in which was ranked 1st or 2nd, but succeed to promote only at the end of the 1992\u201393 season. Metalul spent next five seasons in the Divizia B, but again with no notable results, finally relegating at the end of the 1997\u201398 season. During the 1998\u201399 edition, Metalul almost relegated in the 4th tier after it was ranked only 16th, worst ranking since 1967, but had an almost incredible comeback next season, when it promoted once again in the Divizia B. After another four seasons in the second division, in which Metalul had honorable rankings (6th \u2013 2000\u201301, 5th \u2013 2001\u201302, 9th \u2013 2001\u201302 and 6th \u2013 2003\u201304), the club opted to withdrew from the second tier and sold its place to Dinamo II Bucure\u0219ti, subsequently being dissolved. In this last period spent in the Divizia B, Metalul was also, for a short period, the second squad of Astra Ploie\u0219ti. ===Lower leagues (2006\u2013present)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"right\" |- |style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Name |style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Period |- |1947\u20131967 |align=left|Metalul Plopeni |- |1967\u20131968 |align=left|Rapid Plopeni |- |1968\u20132004 |align=left|Metalul Plopeni |- |2004\u20132006 |align=left|*not active |- |2006\u20132010 |align=left|Intersport Plopeni |- |2010\u2013present |align=left|CSO Plopeni |} After two years of inactivity, Metalul Plopeni was re-founded, this time under the name of Intersport Plopeni. Intersport was far from Metalul's performances and never played higher than the 4th tier, despite the good conditions it had, compared to the rivals from the league. In the summer of 2009, Inersport Plopeni was included in the newly formed multi-sport club CSO Plopeni. In this way, Intersport started to be the football section of CSO Plopeni, also changing its name during the summer of 2010, from Intersport Plopeni to CSO Plopeni. After only one season, with a proper funding from the Town of Plopeni, CSO promoted in the Liga III, performance that was considered an important comeback for the small town, after 6 years of absence from the national leagues. But the financial status of the former \"metal workers\" was not so good as it was in the past, plopenarii finishing 12th (2010\u201311) and 10th (2011\u201312), before withdrawing in the first part of the 2012\u201313 season. In 2013 CSO Plopeni, which was not dissolved this time, enrolled in the Liga IV, but never promoted again until now, obtaining the following rankings: 6th (2013\u201314), 4th (2014\u201315), 7th (2015\u201316), 5th (2016\u201317 and 2018\u201319) and 9th (2017\u201318). At the end of the first part of the 2019\u201320 season, CSO Plopeni is the leader of the series, with important chances of promotion, but the battle seems to be tough, teams such as Tricolorul Breaza and Petrolistul Bolde\u0219ti being righ behind. ==Ground== Ggeorghe \u0218ilaev Stadium, home ground of CSO Plopeni. CSO Plopeni plays its home matches on Gheorghe \u0218ilaev Stadium in Plopeni, with a capacity of 9,000 people. The stadium's is a multi-purpose one and has main stand that was built on a concrete structure, with a vintage roof, sustained by pillars and 5,000 seats. The rest of the stadium was built on metal frame and it is quite degraded. The stadium was opened in the 1940s and was renovated and expanded for several times, especially during the communist period (before 1990). The arena is named after former director of the Plopeni Factory between 1952 and 1978, Gheorghe \u0218ilaev. ==Honours== *Liga III **Winners (7): 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1982\u201383, 1986\u201387, 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 **Runners-up (2): 1989\u201390, 1990\u201391 *Liga IV \u2013 Prahova County **Winners (2): 2009\u201310, 2019\u201320 *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei \u2013 Prahova County **Runners-up (1): 2015\u201316, 2018\u201319 === Other performances === *Appearances in Liga II: 25 *Best finish in Liga II: 3rd (1977\u201378, 1978\u201379) *Best finish in Cupa Rom\u00e2niei: Round of 16 (1965\u201366) ==Current squad== ==Club Officials== ===Board of directors=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Role ! style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Name |- | Owners | Plopeni Town Radu Perpelea |- | President | \u0218tefan Huza |} ===Current technical staff=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Role ! style=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #0000FF\"|Name |- | Manager | Iulius M\u0103rg\u0103rit |- | Assistant Coach | Silvian Dobre |} ==League history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" !
