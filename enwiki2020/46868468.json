It produces yellow-pigmented hyphae and microsclerotia, while producing resting mycelium. It is most closely related to V. albo-atrum and V. nonalfalfae. ==References== ==Further reading== *Inderbitzin, Patrik, et al. \"Identification and differentiation of Verticillium species and V. longisporum lineages by simplex and multiplex PCR assays.\" PLoS ONE8.6 (2013): e65990. *Stajner, Natasa. \"Identification and Differentiation of Verticillium Species with PCR Markers and Sequencing of ITS Region.\" Plant and Animal Genome XXIII Conference.
