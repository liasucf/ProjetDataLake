    "text": "The Gold Medal Camp Furniture Company building is a historic factory complex in Racine, Wisconsin. The three-story brick-walled mill-type was built between 1894 and 1924. The Wisconsin Historical Society describes the complex as \"one of the best remaining examples of a mill-type factory building\" in the state. ==History== The Racine Camp Furniture & Novelty Manufacturing Co. was founded in 1890, to manufacture furniture for camping such as tents, folding chairs, and sleeping bags. Supposedly, after the company's furniture won a gold medal at the 1893 World's Fair exhibition in Chicago, the name was changed to the Gold Medal Camp Furniture Company.Pfankuchen, David. \"Gold Medal plant closing\", Racine Journal Times, September 10, 1986, page 1A and 2A. However, no gold medals were actually awarded at the fair,\"The Prize Winning Medallion Awarded at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, IL\", Living History of Illinois and Chicago. and there is evidence of the company using the Gold Medal name earlier.\"Going to the Front: Gold Medal Camp Furniture Company Business Increasing\", Racine Journal Times, May 5, 1892, page four. The company made the standard cots for the United States military and National Guard,\"1700 PACKARD AVE\", Wisconsin Historical Society. and also created the modern director's chair after its No. 35 folding chairs became popular in Hollywood.\"Columbian Exposition Gave Name; Movie Stars Glamorized Product\", Racine Journal Times, February 21, 1967, page 4A. In 1979, Gold Medal established a second manufacturing plant in Baxter, Tennessee. In 1986, the company decided to consolidate its operations in the face of increased competition from overseas, and closed the Racine plant. In 2019, the complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the request of its owner, development firm J. Jeffers & Co., which is currently n the process of converting the historic buildings into an apartment building called Gold Medal Lofts.Burke, Michael. \"Gold Medal Lofts redevelopment well underway, will create 77 apartments\", Racine Journal Times, August 25, 2019. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Racine, Wisconsin Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin ",
