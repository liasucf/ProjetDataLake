    "text": "Tusbab Stallions are a football club established in 2019 and based in Madang, Papua New Guinea. The club took part in the Northern Conference of the 2019 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, their first competition entry. == History == The club was established in 2019 as successor of an amateur club dating back to 2004 of the same name, which itself was founded after a merge between two separate Madang-based clubs, Tusbab and Blue Kumuls. The amateur side had won the Madang Soccer Association Grand Final in 2018, prior to their move to semi-professional status. On 11 January 2019, the side was confirmed as one of the sides entered into the 2019 National Soccer League, and had been drawn into the Northern Conference, after merging with Madang. They won their opening fixture with a 1\u20130 victory over Laiwaden FC. By the halfway stage of the season, the side sat fifth out of eight sides in the conference, having won two games and drawn one. The second half of their season was poor, with the side picking up just one more point, a 1\u20131 draw with Laiwaden, before five consecutive defeats saw them finish at the bottom of the conference. == Domestic Record == === National Competitions === * Papua New Guinea National Soccer League **2019: Northern Conference: 8th ==Players== ===Current squad=== Squad for 2019\u201320 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League ==Club officials== ===Management=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
