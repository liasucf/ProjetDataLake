    "text": "K-Def (full name Kevin Hansford) is an American, New Jersey based, hip hop producer/DJ who has been actively involved in the music industry since the early 1990s. He has recently produced music for artists such as Ghostface Killah and Puff Daddy. K-Def earned critical praise early in his career for his work with Marley Marl on the album Here Come the Lords by the hip hop group Lords of the Underground.[ allmusic ((( K-Def > Overview )))] Among the songs from that album that benefited from K-Def's production work include the hits \"Funky Child\" and \"Chief Rocka\". ==Biography== K-Def was also member of the duo Real Live, which released one album The Turnaround: A Long Awaited Drama on Big Beat/Atlantic Records in 1996. \"Real Live Shit (Remix)\" featured Cappadonna, Ghostface Killah, Killa Sin and Lord Tariq. In April 2018, Rhino Entertainment issued a digital download of the album. K-Def is mostly known for his blues-soul sampling style. While the majority of his early-mid 1990s productions were produced using the Akai MPC sampler/sequencer, around 1997 he started incorporating computers into his work flow and now exclusively uses a software based setup. In 2004 K-Def produced \"Its Over\" on the Ghostface Killah release The Pretty Toney Album. He then contributed tracks to another Ghostface project, Theodore Unit, and Ol' Dirty Bastard's The Osirus Mixtape. He was a contributor to Diddy's 2006 release Press Play, and, in 2007, he produced a track on UGK\u2019s album Underground Kingz. In 2006, K-Def released an instrumental album called Willie Boo Boo The Fool. The album was originally only available on CD and vinyl, but it was digitally re-released in 2008. In 2008, K-Def released a collaborative EP with the rapper Dacapo under the name the Program, which was titled The Article. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *The Turnaround: A Long Awaited Drama (1996), (with Larry-O as Real Live) *Willie Boo Boo The Fool (2006) *The Article EP (2008), (with DaCapo as The Program) *Beats From The 90's Vol. 1 (2008) *Beats From The 90's Vol. 2 (2009) *Gangster Instrumentals (2010) *Night Shift (2011) *One Man Band (2013) *The Exhibit (2013) *The Meeting EP (2013) ===Production=== Reverse Chronological *UGK - Underground Kingz - \"Next Up\" - (Jive/SME) 2007 *KRS-One & Marley Marl \u2013 Hip Hop Lives - \"The Teacha\" - (Koch) 2007 *Diddy- Press Play \u2013 \"We Gon Make It\" - (Bad Boy/Atlantic) 2006 *El Da Sensei \u2013 The Unusual \u2013 (Fat Beats) 2006 *Ol' Dirty Bastard \u2013 Osirus \u2013 \"Rock It Out\" - (Sure Shot) 2005 **Who Can Make It Happen Like Dirt **High In The Clouds\" **Pussy Keep Calling **Fuck Y'all *Theodore Unit \u2013 718 \u2013 (Sure Shot) 2005 **Paychecks **Wicked With Lead **Pass The Mike *Ghostface Killah \u2013 The Pretty Toney Album \u2013 It's Over \u2013 (Def Jam/IDJMG/Universal) 2004 *Jayo Felony\u2013 Crip Hop - True'd Up (Remix) (Loco) 2002 *Jayo Felony\u2013 Bulletproof Love - True\u2019d Up \u2013 (Motown/Universal) 2001 *Lords of the Underground \u2013 Resurrection \u2013 If You - 2000 *Lord Tariq \u2013 This Cold World \u2013 (not on label) 2000 *Craig Mack \u2013 Please Listen To My Demo \u2013 (not on label) - 2000 *Artifacts\u2013 It's Gettin Hot (Remix) \u2013 (Big Beat/Atlantic) 1997 *Mic Geronimo\u2013 Vendetta \u2013 For Tha Family \u2013 (TVT) 1998 *World Renown \u2013 How Nice I Am \u2013 (Warner Bros., unreleased) 1995 *DE\u20191 \u2013 I\u2019m Rather Unique - (Reprise/Warner Bros.) 1995 *A.D.O.R. \u2013 One for the Trouble \u2013 (Atlantic) 1994 *Nonchalant \u2013 5 O\u2019Clock (Remix) \u2013 (MCA) 1995 *Shabba Ranks - Ting A Ling (REMIX) - Rough and Ready Volume 1 (Epic/SME) - 1994 *Da Youngstas \u2013 No Mercy (East West America/Atlantic) \u2013 1994 * **Mad Props **Backstabbers **Stayed Away **Illy Philly Funk **Reality *Lords of the Underground \u2013 Keepers of the Funk \u2013 (Pendulum/EMI) - 1994 **Steam From The Knot **What I'm After **No Pain **Frustrated **Faith **What I'm After (Remix) *Lords of the Underground \u2013 Here Come the Lords \u2013 (Pendulum/Elektra) - 1993 **From The Bricks **Funky Child **Mad Skillz **Lotug **Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time **Chief Rocka *Positive K - Ain't No Crime (K-Def DL Mix) - (Island/PolyGram) 1993 *Sah-B - Some Od' Sah-B Shit \u2013 (Reprise/Warner Bros.) 1994 *Tragedy Khadafi \u2013 Street Life - Return of The Life (Remix) \u2013 (Tuff Break/A&M;/PolyGram) - 1993 *Tragedy Khadafi \u2013 Tragedy: Saga of a Hoodlum \u2013 (Tuff Break/A&M;/PolyGram) - 1993 **Shalom A Leck **Pass The Teck **Uunderground **Funkmode **Grand Groove **Mad Brothas Know His Name *Monie Love - In A Word Or Two \u2013 (Warner Bros.) - 1993 **There\u2019s a Better Way **For da Children **Let a Woman be a Woman ==References== ==External links== *K-Def's Official Website Category:Musicians from New Jersey Category:American hip hop record producers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Wu-Tang Clan affiliates ",
