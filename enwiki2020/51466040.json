    "text": "In mathematics, Legendre's relation can be expressed in either of two forms: as a relation between complete elliptic integrals, or as a relation between periods and quasiperiods of elliptic functions. The two forms are equivalent as the periods and quasiperiods can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals. It was introduced (for complete elliptic integrals) by . ==Complete elliptic integrals== Legendre's relation stated using complete elliptic integrals is : K'E + KE' - KK' = \\frac \\pi 2 where K and K\u2032 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind for values satisfying , and E and E\u2032 are the complete elliptic integrals of the second kind. This form of Legendre's relation expresses the fact that the Wronskian of the complete elliptic integrals (considered as solutions of a differential equation) is a constant. ==Elliptic functions== Legendre's relation stated using elliptic functions is : \\omega_2 \\eta_1 - \\omega_1 \\eta_2 = 2\\pi i \\, where \u03c91 and \u03c92 are the periods of the Weierstrass elliptic function, and \u03b71 and \u03b72 are the quasiperiods of the Weierstrass zeta function. Some authors normalize these in a different way differing by factors of 2, in which case the right hand side of the Legendre relation is i or i / 2\\. This relation can be proved by integrating the Weierstrass zeta function about the boundary of a fundamental region and applying Cauchy's residue theorem. ==References== * * * * Category:Elliptic functions ",
