Pete Doherty stated in a Rolling Stone interview that it started out as a certain Velvet Underground song, The Velvet Underground song \"Walk and Talk\" is most likely what he is referring to. ==Music video== The music video has been directed by Douglas Hart. It features the band, getting back to nature, strolling through an autumnal Savernake forest, gazing skywards. The scene switches to a dark, crowded and somewhat claustrophobic room. There is a party going on, under a swinging, interrogation type lamp, with a group of men in business suits and the band. At various stages, Doherty appears to be flat on his back, as he observes this gathering. There is a dark and light theme throughout the clip, with the band seen in the darkness of the forest at first and then later in the video, out in the open, in the bright sunlight. ==Track listing== *7\" R 6750 # \"You Talk\" # \"Revelations\" *CD CDR 6750 # \"You Talk\" # \"UnBiloTitled\" (acoustic) # \"Carry On Up the Morning\" (acoustic) ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2007) !Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|54 |} ==References== ==External links== *Single review by Soundfires.com * Category:2007 singles Category:Babyshambles songs Category:Songs written by Pete Doherty Category:Song recordings produced by Stephen Street Category:2007 songs Category:Parlophone singles ",
