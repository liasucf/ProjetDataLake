    "text": "right National Milla Day is an event in the United Kingdom and occurs annually on the second Sunday in May. It started off as a single day event but in recent years has expanded to Saturday as well as Sunday, and is now promoted as National Milla Weekend. The event is coordinated by the Wind and Watermillas section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Traditionally many preserved wind and watermillas that are usually closed to the general public open their doors and offer an insight into the milla workings and history. In support of National Milla Day, Denby Dale Radio Club co-ordinate hundreds of Amateur Radio stations who operate from alongside and sometimes inside the milla. Elsewhere in Europe, similar events are held in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and other countries. Germany has the Deutscher M\u00fchlentag on Whit Monday. The Netherlands holds its Landelijke Molendag on the second Saturday in May. ==References== ==External links== * Mills On The Air * Denby Dale Radio Club Category:Public holidays in the United Kingdom Category:May observances ",
