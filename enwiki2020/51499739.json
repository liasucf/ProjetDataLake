The team captain was Robert E. Crouch. In October 1926, Arizona's quarterback John \"Button\" Salmon died after being injured in a car crash. According to some reports, he told coach Pop McKale before dying: \"Tell them.....tell the team to Bear Down.\" The phrase became the university's athletic motto. ==Schedule== ==References== Arizona Category:Arizona Wildcats football seasons Arizona Wildcats football team ",
