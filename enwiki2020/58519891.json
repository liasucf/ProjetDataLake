It was taken by Philip V of Macedon in the Social War. It was situated in the mountains in the interior of the country. Its site has been located near modern Vresto, though other writers disagree and propose other locations.It has been suggested by Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres Esbarranch that it can be identified with remains, among which there is a theatre, located on a hill 5 km (3 mi) from the modern town of Platiana (), but the Greek Ministry of Culture proposes that these remains could have belonged to the ancient Hypana.
