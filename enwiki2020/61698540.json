Many more are attributed to his son \"Henrik Gerner\".

Shipbuilding was considered an art rather than a science. Part of the committee's remit was to ensure the proper education of promising young naval officers in all aspects of ship construction and, to this end, the commission would send officers on extended study tours to the other naval powers of Europe to learn not only of recent advances in ship building but also harbour design and maintenance, defence works, dykes, and flood management. Other scientific advances, mechanical and technical inventions not directly related to naval matters were also noted \\- occasionally, a little espionage was required.Royal Danish Naval Museum - Technology In 1742 the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences was established in Copenhagen to which the educated officer corps of the Danish navy contributed much useful debate. Apprentice ship builders would return from their foreign tours often to become members of the Construction Committee and to lecture at the Sea Cadet Academy on shipbuilding. Some would eventually become the head of naval construction, Fabrikmester, a position which required not only professional expertise but also political and personal qualities of leadership. Criticism on grounds of seaworthiness or cost of the designs, or loss of political support made the position of Fabrikmester very stressful for some of the incumbents. ==Notes== ==References== ==Citations== *Gyldendal - Th.
