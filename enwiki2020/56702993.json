    "text": "Callemondah is a coastal suburb of Gladstone in the Gladstone Region, Queensland, Australia. == Geography == The Calliope River forms the south- western boundary of the suburb before flowing north through the suburb into Gladstone Harbour. Auckland Inlet forms its eastern boundary separating it from Gladstone Central. The land use is predominantly industrial with a number of coal port facilities with associated stockpiles, the NRG Gladstone Powerhouse (the largest in Queensland), railway servicing facilities and numerous other industrial businesses. The Callemondah railway station is located on the southern boundary of the suburb. It is on the North Coast railway line, the Moura railway line, the Blackwater railway line and a number private rail lines within Callemondah servicing various industrial facilities. == History == The suburb takes its name from the railway station which was assigned in August 1967 by Queensland Railways Department to their locomotive servicing facility, using an Aboriginal word (probably from a New South Wales area), meaning plenty of hills. == Education == Central Queensland University operates its Gladstone Marina campus on Bryan Jordan Drive in the north-east tip of Callemondah which is linked by a bridge across the Auckland Inlet to Gladstone Central. As the name suggests, the campus is adjacent to the Gladstone Marina. == Fishery == Lake Callemondah is an artificial lake adjacent to Auckland Inlet but separated from it by a rock and concrete wall. The lake receives stormwater run-off from the roofs and streets of the local area. In 1999 barramundi fingerlings were first introduced into the lake. As the fish mature, they are able to migrate into Auckland Inlet and beyond. Up to 2,800 new fingerlings are added to the lake each year. By tagging the fish, it has been established most of the mature fish stay in the Gladstone area, but one has been found up 36 km away in the Boyne River. == References == == External links == Category:Gladstone Region Category:Coastline of Queensland ",
