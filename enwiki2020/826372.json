    "text": "Momir Bulatovi\u0107 (; 21 September 1956 \u2013 30 June 2019) was a Montenegrin politician. He was the first President of the Republic of Montenegro from 1990 to 1998, after which he served as the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1998 until 2000, when Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was overthrown. He was a leader of the Montenegro's Democratic Party of Socialists from 1989 to 1997, when he split from DPS after a conflict with Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107. During his mandate as President of Montenegro within Yugoslavia, he oversaw the engagement of Montenegrin reservists in the Yugoslav People's Army in the Siege of Dubrovnik as well as in the Bosnian War. According to Florence Hartmann, Bulatovi\u0107 was subject to an investigation by the ICTY for war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but was not charged. He was a defense witness in the trials of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, and Nikola \u0160ainovi\u0107 at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. ==Early life== Bulatovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade as the son of a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer who originated from Montenegro. The family lived in the Vo\u017edovac neighbourhood. Due to the nature of his father's job his family frequently relocated throughout Yugoslavia. When Momir was five years old, the family moved to Zadar in Croatia, where he completed his primary and secondary education. In 1975 the 18-year-old Bulatovi\u0107 moved to Titograd to study at the Veljko Vlahovi\u0107 University's Faculty of Economics. According to Bulatovi\u0107, he wanted to return to Belgrade for university studies, but his family did not have enough money to send him there, so he ended up in Titograd.

After the anti- bureaucratic revolution in January 1989, Bulatovi\u0107 was promoted to the presidency of the League of Communists of Montenegro. With the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bulatovi\u0107 became President of Yugoslavia's Republic of Montenegro, serving in that position from 23 December 1990 to 15 January 1998. During his tenure, he was a loyal ally to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and oversaw the Montenegrin reserve of the Yugoslav People's Army in the Croatian and Bosnian wars. In the 1990 Yugoslav Communist party's congress, Bulatovi\u0107 supported Milo\u0161evi\u0107's agenda of changing the party's voting system to a one-member-one-vote system which would give a numerical majority to Serbs. Montenegro also supported Serbia in opposing all reforms proposed by Slovenia that were deemed to be intended to devolve power to the republics. The Slovenian and Croatian communist factions abdicated the party in what they saw as an attempt by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to create Serb hegemony in the party. The League of Communists collapsed, Bulatovi\u0107 followed the political changes in the other republics and made Montenegro a multi-party democracy and formed the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) with former communists. ==President of Montenegro (1990\u20131998)== ===Siege of Dubrovnik (1991)=== On 1 October 1991, Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington came to Titograd and asked Bulatovi\u0107 if Dubrovnik was in danger of an attack by the Yugoslav People's Army. According to testimony by Nikola Samard\u017ei\u0107 to the ICTY, a member of Bulatovi\u0107's cabinet, Bulatovi\u0107 promised Carrington that Dubrovnik would not be attacked. Just a few hours after meeting Carrington, Bulatovi\u0107 attended a meeting with several generals of the Yugoslav People's Army, including Pavle Strugar, after which Bulatovi\u0107 told Samard\u017ei\u0107 that \"30,000 Ustashe are coming from Dubrovnik to seize the Bay of Kotor\", and that a response was urgent. Bulatovi\u0107 ultimately participated in ordering an attempted annexation of Dubrovnik to Montenegro, additionally claiming that it was historically linked to Montenegro.The 1991 Siege of Dubrovnik and the Consequences of the \"War for Peace\", yorku.ca; retrieved 31 January 2014. After the war ended, Bulatovi\u0107 claimed that the attack on Dubrovnik was \"the only way to prevent the conflict from spreading into Montenegro\", but also asserted that the military gave the government of Montenegro \"false information\". ===Carrington's proposal (1991)=== The siege of Dubrovnik, in addition to war crimes committed, had enormous consequences for Yugoslavia's international standing. The European Economic Community invited Carrington and representatives from Yugoslavia to negotiate a peace accord known as the Carrington plan on 19 October 1991, in The Hague. The proposal of a \"loose federation of independent states\" was a non-starter for Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who preferred a centralized Yugoslavia with institutional powers in Belgrade. Bulatovi\u0107, to the shock of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his own party members, agreed to Carrington's terms and even signed a draft of the plan during an overnight session of the Montenegrin parliament on October 17, arguing that it would secure Montenegro's interests and end the Yugoslav wars. Bulatovi\u0107's signature potentially guaranteed Montenegro's legal right to secede from Yugoslavia, resulting in an almost explosive rift with the Yugoslav leadership in Belgrade. Borisav Jovi\u0107 contacted Bulatovi\u0107 about his support for the Carrington plan in disbelief, asking him if he had been paid off by the Croats, Austrians, or Italians. Bulatovi\u0107 claimed that the Carrington proposal offered Montenegro the Prevlaka peninsula, and that it guaranteed Montenegro would not be subject to sanctions. Furthermore, Italian foreign minister Gianni De Michelis claimed that Bulatovi\u0107 told him that he \"wanted to chart an independent course from Belgrade.\" In a follow-up session of the Montenegrin parliament on 24\u201325 October, parliament and party members ratified Bulatovi\u0107's signature on the Carrington plan, making the accord more imminent. However, in a sharp turn, the Narodna Stranka (People's Party) called for an emergency session in the Montenegrin parliament, during which Bulatovi\u0107 was accused of treason. Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 defended Bulatovi\u0107 in the parliamentary hearing. Bulatovi\u0107 tried to make his own case, telling the parliament members \"if servility and acceptance of everything coming from Belgrade is the criteria for good governance in Montenegro, then this nation doesn't need a government, elections, or political parties.\" Subsequently, Bulatovi\u0107 was invited to a meeting with Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 in Belgrade; Bulatovi\u0107 described the meeting as \"very explosive\". As a result of the meeting, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 added a clause to Bulatovi\u0107's Carrington commitment, such that a republic could decide to stay in Yugoslavia through a referendum. This resulted in the 1992 independence referendum, where voters in Montenegro decided to remain in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. === Muslim communities in Montenegro === With the war raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulatovi\u0107 faced the first serious threat of \"spill-over\" in the summer of in 1992, when Muslims in Pljevlja were subject to intimidation and violence. On 6 August 1992, a local warlord named Milika \"\u010ceko\" Da\u010devi\u0107 walked into Pljevlja's police headquarters to ask that a vehicle which was seized be returned to his personal envoy, threatening to \"declare war\" on Pljevlja. Although Bulatovi\u0107 described Da\u010devi\u0107 as someone \"who hardly can be characterized as sane\", over half of the police force turned themselves over to Da\u010devi\u0107 during his custody, essentially turning over the police station to Da\u010devi\u0107's militia. In addition to the stand-off with Da\u010devi\u0107, his militia included forces of the Kornja\u010da brothers from \u010cajni\u010de, who helped blocked off the town from a garrison of the Yugoslav People's Army. Du\u0161ko Kornja\u010da threatened to kill all of the Muslims in Pljevlja unless Da\u010devi\u0107 was released. The militia's control over Pljevlja was strong enough that the Yugoslav People's Army garrison in Pljevlja, composed of only 73 soldiers, refused to confront them. As a result, on 7 August 1992, Bulatovi\u0107, \u0110ukanovi\u0107, Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107 and \u017divota Pani\u0107 came to Pljevlja to negotiate with all parties involved. During the negotiations, a representative of Pljevlja's Islamic community named Hakija Ajanovi\u0107 asked Bulatovi\u0107 to tighten border controls to prevent Serbian paramilitaries from Bosnia entering Montenegro. In contrast, Bulatovi\u0107 had been told by the police that \"the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina was not possible to secure\". In the end, Bulatovi\u0107 and his colleagues promised the Islamic community in Pljevlja that they would attempt to disarm the paramilitaries and add reinforcements of the Yugoslav People's Army to patrol the town. To satisfy the militia, Bulatovi\u0107 asked the local Muslims not to seek autonomy, although they had not done so over the course of the meeting. In spite of Bulatovi\u0107's reassurances, Pljevlja's Muslim community suffered various incidents, particularly in the village of Bukovica where 6 Muslim inhabitants were killed from 1992 to 1995. Additionally, the first kidnapping of Muslim inhabitants took place in Pljevlja on February 15 1993, where Muslim family members were taken to a prison in \u010cajni\u010de. After a negotiation leading to the release of Serbian reservists held as prisoners by the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulatovi\u0107 announced the freeing of the Bungur family from the \u010cajni\u010de prison in 1993, crediting \u0106osi\u0107 and Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 \"personal responsibility\" for the family's freedom. In May 1993, Bulatovi\u0107 participated in the negotiations of Vance-Owen Plan, held in Athens in the presence of Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis. Bulatovi\u0107 along with \u0106osi\u0107 and Milo\u0161evi\u0107 collaborated in pressuring Karad\u017ei\u0107 to sign the plan. Karad\u017ei\u0107 eventually signed the plan, after which Bulatovi\u0107 traveled with \u0106osi\u0107 and Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to Pale, where they tried to convince wartime Republika Srpska's parliament to adopt the resolution signed in Athens. The parliament of Republika Srpska in Pale rejected the resolution in defiance of the Milo\u0161evi\u0107-\u0106osi\u0107-Bulatovi\u0107 team, and the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued for another two years. ===Loss to \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and departure from the Democratic Party of Socialists=== On 11 July 1997, the national committee (\"Glavni odbor\", abbreviated as \"GO\") of DPS, formerly the League of Communists, held a closed doors session after which the committee selected Milica Pejanovi\u0107-\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to replace Bulatovi\u0107 as the party president. The party split had enormous implications, making a political confrontation between \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and Bulatovi\u0107 inevitable. This manifested in the 1997 Montenegrin presidential election held in October, which \u0110ukanovi\u0107 won by a thin margin. Although the OSCE recognized the result as legitimate, Bulatovi\u0107 claimed that the United States interfered in \u0110ukanovi\u0107's favor. Bulatovi\u0107 then participated in the mobilization of a large demonstration at \u0110ukanovi\u0107's inauguration in Podgorica on 14 January 1998. The protest at \u0110ukanovi\u0107's inauguration was confronted by the police, resulting in the injury of 44 policemen and four civilians. On 21 March 1998, Bulatovi\u0107 mobilized a large fraction from DPS CG and helped found the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro (SNP). ==Prime Minister of Yugoslavia (1998\u20132000)== On 21 May 1998, Bulatovi\u0107 was named the new Prime Minister of Yugoslavia by the country's parliament, replacing \u0110ukanovi\u0107-loyalist Radoje Konti\u0107. On 23 March 1999, he signed a declaration of a state of war when NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. He resigned on 9 October 2000, shortly after Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was ousted. ==Later life, death and legacy== He withdrew from frontline politics in 2001. His son Bo\u0161ko died at the age of 21 on 24 June 2008 after a short illness. In 2017, Bulatovi\u0107 took part in protests by the pro-Serb opposition in Montenegro against the country\u2019s NATO membership. He was last seen in public at the funeral of Mirjana Markovi\u0107 in April 2019. Bulatovi\u0107 died on 30 June 2019 at his family's home near Podgorica. A close associate, Milan Kne\u017eevi\u0107, said the former president apparently suffered a heart attack. He was 62. Kne\u017eevi\u0107, an opposition politician, said Bulatovi\u0107 \"left a permanent trace in Montenegrin politics as a man who fought for his beliefs until the last day.\" Others, including some prosecutors at the ICTY, saw him as one of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's partners in crime in the 1990s wars in Yugoslavia. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== |- |- |- |- |- Category:1956 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Belgrade Category:Serbs of Montenegro Category:University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics alumni Category:Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro politicians Category:Socialist People's Party of Montenegro politicians Category:People's Socialist Party of Montenegro politicians Category:New Serb Democracy politicians Category:Presidents of Montenegro Category:League of Communists of Montenegro politicians ",
