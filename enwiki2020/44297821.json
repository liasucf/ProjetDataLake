But when Do-hyun dies unexpectedly, the Ma family makes Soo-in take the fall for their illegal business practices and she ends up in jail for stock manipulation that she didn't commit. At Cheongju's Penitentiary for Women, her cellmates are kind- hearted Shim Bok-nyeo who was falsely accused of killing her husband and son; tough-as-nails, foul-mouthed Son Poong-geum who was convicted of fraud; and former model Seo Mi-oh who's been charged with the attempted murder of her boyfriend, Shinhwa Group's youngest son. The four women bond and become friends, particularly when they join the baking classes being taught by Nam Woo-suk, a hotel chef. Woo-suk is a widower who is raising his daughter alone after the death of his wife six years ago. At his father-in-law's suggestion, he became a volunteer at the local prison's vocational training center, where he meets Soo-in and begins to fall for her. Upon their discharge, the four women put the baking skills they learned in prison to use, opening up a bakery together. But they face stiff competition from the Shinhwa Group. ==Cast== ===Main characters=== *Han Ji-hye as Moon Soo-in *Ha Seok-jin as Nam Woo-seok *Go Doo-shim as Shim Bok-nyeo *Oh Hyun-kyung as Son Poong-geum *Ha Yeon-soo as Seo Mi-oh ===Supporting characters=== ;Ma's Family *Park Geun-hyung as Ma Tae- san **Shim Hyung-tak as young Tae-san *Jung Hye-sun as Bok Dan-shim *Jeon In- hwa as Cha Aeng-ran **Ha Eun-jin as young Aeng-Ran *Byun Jung-soo as Ma Joo- ran *Lee Seung-joon as Park Won-jae *Kim Yoon-seo as Ma Joo-hee *Do Sang-woo as Ma Do-jin *Go Joo-won as Ma Do-hyun (cameo) ;Seochon Residence Family *Park In-hwan as Park Yi-moon *Lee Jong-won as Tak Wol-han *Lee Sook as Bae Chung-ja *Lee Han-seo as Nam Byeol *Kim Soo-mi as Kim Young-wok ===Extended Characters=== *Hong Ah-reum as Eun Bo-kyung *Lee Seung-hyeong as Director Wang *Kwon Seong-deok as Kim Deok-Gu *Kim Jung-dyoon as Lee Gang-Choon *Yum Dong- hun as Oh Man-Bok *Park Ah-sung as Mr.Kim ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
