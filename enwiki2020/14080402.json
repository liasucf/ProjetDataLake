    "text": "Oathean is a South Korean black metal band that formed in 1993 originally under the name 'Odin', for the Norse/Scandinavian god. They went on a short hiatus and then changed their name three years later. Oathean's lyrics tend to deal with themes of sadness and depression. Their particular style of metal is influenced by folk metal, and incorporates Korean world music with the use of traditional Korean instruments such as the haegeum and daegeum. Founding member Do-Su Kim started and runs his own label, Jusin Productions, which releases much of the band's output, and has joined in for sessions with Holymarsh. ==Members== ===Current members=== * Kim Do-Su \u2013 vocals, guitar (1993-) * Dhemian Frost \u2013 bass guitar * Jung Young-Sin \u2013 drums ===Former members=== * Bak Jae-Ryeon \u2013 drums * Lee Soo-Hyeong \u2013 drums * Jeon Seong-Man \u2013 drums * Heo Ji-Woo \u2013 drums * Baek Hyeon \u2013 guitar * Kim Dong-Hyeon \u2013 drums * Kim Woon \u2013 drums * Kim Min-Suk \u2013 guitar * Kim Hee-Tae \u2013 guitar * Lee Bun-Do \u2013 guitar * Lee Hee-Doo \u2013 lead guitar * Lee Jun-Hyeok \u2013 lead guitar * Kim Min-Su \u2013 bass, vocals * Park Yong-Hee \u2013 bass guitar * Song Seong-Hwan \u2013 bass guitar * Moon Jong-Su \u2013 bass guitar * Gu Hae-Ryeong \u2013 keyboards ===Session members=== * Naamah \u2212 drums * Son Ji-Yeong \u2212 haegeum * Lee Yu-Gyeong \u2212 daegeum * Kim Eun- Yeong \u2212 daegeum * Kim Deok-Su \u2212 keyboards * Gwak Ju-Lim \u2212 vocals ==Discography== * Demo '97 (Demo, 1997) * The Eyes of Tremendous Sorrow (CD, independent, 1998) * When All Memories Are Shattered (EP, Jusin, 2001) * Ten Days in Lachrymation (CD, Jusin, 2001) * The Last Desperate 10 Years as Ever (CD, Shinbiro, 2003; contains new songs, the 1997 demo, and remastered old songs) * Fading Away into the Grave of Nothingness (CD, Jusin, 2004) * The Eyes of Tremendous Sorrow + As a Solitary Tree Against the Sky (CD, Jusin, 2005; contains five new songs and the first album) * Regarding All the Sadness of the World (CD, Jusin, 2008) * Oathean (CD, Jusin, 2010) ==References== ==External links== * Oathean official website * Oathean's official MySpace page * Oathean at Encyclopaedia Metallum Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:South Korean black metal musical groups Category:Musical quintets Category:1993 establishments in South Korea Category:Musical groups from Seoul ",
