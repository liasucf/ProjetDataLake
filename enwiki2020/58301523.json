It is located in the Bodo State Wildlife Area, southwest of the community of Durango in La Plata County, Colorado, United States. Smelter Mountain rises over above the town, and the lower slope of the mountain was home to the Durango smelter, hence the name of the mountain. Precipitation runoff from Smelter Mountain drains into tributaries of the Animas River. A 1.2 mile hiking trail leads to the summit, and other recreational activities include hunting and paragliding.The Durango Herald, July 10, 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Weather forecast: Smelter Mountain Category:Mountains of La Plata County, Colorado Category:San Juan Mountains (Colorado) Category:Mountains of Colorado ",
