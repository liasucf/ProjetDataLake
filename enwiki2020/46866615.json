Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, it is the largest private funder for Canadian kids' media for independent producers, and is one of Shaw Communications' key programs. == History == The Shaw Rocket Fund was created in 1998 (known then as the Shaw Television Broadcast Fund) by Shaw Communications as a private funder of Canadian kids' TV production. In 2004, Agnes Augustin became President & CEO of the Fund. Agnes was previously a Manager and Vice President of Business Affairs for production and distribution companies, Head of Production for CMT, and an independent producer. Shaw Communications continues to contribute to the Shaw Rocket Fund (over $200 million as of 2019), and the Shaw Rocket Fund has invested over $220 million into 865 programs of Canadian kids' content. The Shaw Rocket Fund is listed as a Certified Independent Production Fund by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and as a private funder with the Canadian Media Production Association. == Board == The Shaw Rocket Fund Board consists of five industry professionals. * Chair: Christine Shipton, former Senior Vice President of Content for Shaw Media * Vice-Chair: Gigi Boyd, a Gemini and Leo award winning Producer (\u201cElijah\u201d) * Secretary/Treasurer: Agnes Augustin, Shaw Rocket Fund President & CEO * Director: Chethan Lakshman, Vice- President, External Affairs at Shaw Communications * Director: Nancy Birnbaum, former CEO of Invest in Kids == Shaw Rocket Prize == The Shaw Rocket Fund created the Shaw Rocket Prize in 2004 as a way to award high-quality Canadian children's programs. The Shaw Rocket Prize is an annual award, funded by the Shaw Rocket Fund, that is presented to one or more Canadian television programs. It started out as one $50,000 prize, awarded to the winning program, but in 2013 it expanded to three $25,000 prizes, awarded to a winner in each of three categories (Preschool, Children ages 6\u201312 and Youth ages 13\u201317 & Family). Production companies apply for the Prize by submitting their programs online. Eligible entries are reviewed by an International Jury, made up of four to five industry professionals. Once the jury has selected the finalists, another jury, made up of Canadian children, votes online for the winner. Global TV did a segment on the winners in 2014. === International Jury === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !!
