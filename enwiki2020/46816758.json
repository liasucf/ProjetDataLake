In 1865, he was enrolled at the local gymnasium, but failed his courses and transferred to the Realschule in Budweis, where he met a teacher who encouraged his artistic interests.Brief biography @ Rodon. In 1873, despite this, he followed his father's wishes and entered the Vienna Business School. He soon ignored his studies and spent more time at the local art schools, prompting his parents to bring him home to work in the family business. He was not deterred, however, and devoted his time to painting when his father was absent. Water Gnome (1886) Going against his family, he returned to Vienna in 1874 and audited classes at the Academy of Fine Arts. After further clashes with his father, he finally prevailed and was given the money to enroll. Carl Wurzinger and Josef Maty\u00e1\u0161 Trenkwald were among his instructors there. Some of his first works were purchased by Professor Hans Makart, but later attempts to be financially independent failed and he returned, penniless, to his hometown in 1881. Eventually, he found work as an illustrator and was able to visit the Netherlands in 1888, where he became interested in Dutch architecture and softened his painting style. The following year, Jo\u017ea Uprka invited him to visit Moravian Slovakia. During his stay there, in Hroznov\u00e1 Lhota, he married a local schoolteacher. He had to leave, in 1891, apparently because he was being pursued by creditors and, on his wife's suggestion, moved to Byst\u0159ice pod Host\u00fdnem where they lived in a forester's house, courtesy of Baron von Loudon. In 1896, they were able to travel to Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, where he received a commission to copy the frescoes at the Monastery of the Madonna of Lourdes in Verona. ==Teaching career== In 1899, he accepted a teaching position at the newly opened Brno University of Technology, but was not pleased, as the work involved simple technical drawing, rather than art. To make matters worse, his creditors tracked him down again and he was able to avert legal action only by receiving financial assistance from the poet, Josef Svatopluk Machar. Shortly after, he was awarded a commission by the Thonet brothers. He painted six watercolors, depicting life in their factory, which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1900). He also created some popular tapestry designs for the Moravsk\u00e1 gobel\u00ednov\u00e1 manufaktura. Two years later, he returned to Prague and was named a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. His students there included Otakar Kub\u00edn, V\u00e1clav Rabas, , , Old\u0159ich Bla\u017e\u00ed\u010dek, and Franti\u0161ek Mo\u0159ic N\u00e1gl. In 1906, he developed a tumor on his tongue. He underwent a successful surgery in the Netherlands but, after a few years, the tumor returned. After several more surgeries, it was decided to remove his tongue entirely, and he died of complications not long after. His home in Prague, the \"Villa Tara\", was declared a national landmark in 1921 and currently serves as a hotel.The Villa Schweiger @ IBTM World ==Selected works== File:Schwaiger- Steenfohl.jpg|The Cave of Steenfoll, for a story by Wilhelm Hauff, based on a Scottish legend.
