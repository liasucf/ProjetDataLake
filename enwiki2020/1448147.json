Work done by the STRL includes research on direct-broadcast satellite (BS), Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting, high-definition television, and ultra high definition television. On May 9, 2013, NHK and Mitsubishi Electric announced that they had jointly developed the first High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoder for 8K Ultra HD TV, which is also called Super Hi-Vision (SHV). The HEVC encoder supports the Main 10 profile at Level 6.1 allowing it to encode 10-bit video with a resolution of 7680 \u00d7 4320 at 60 fps. The HEVC encoder has 17 3G-SDI inputs and uses 17 boards for parallel processing with each board encoding a row of 7680 \u00d7 256 pixels to allow for real time video encoding. The HEVC encoder was shown at the NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories Open House 2013 that took place from May 30 to June 2. == See also == * NHK * NHK Twinscam * Ultra high definition television (UHDTV) * High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) - Upcoming video codec that supports resolutions up to 8K UHDTV (7680 \u00d7 4320) ==References== ==External links== *STRL - Japanese *STRL - English *NHK Open House 2013 - English Category:NHK Category:Mass media in Tokyo Category:Television technology Category:Engineering research institutes Category:Scientific organizations established in 1930 Category:Audio engineering Category:Radio technology Category:Research institutes in Japan Category:Sound production technology Category:Sound recording technology Category:1930 establishments in Japan ",
