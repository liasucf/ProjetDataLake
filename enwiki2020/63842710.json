    "text": "Aurat Raj (1979) is one of first Pakistani feminist movies, it was produced and directed by Rangeela. Aurat Raj is a satirical movie and was produced in the socio-politically adverse, conservative Pakistani dictator General Zia-ul- Haq's grim times for women of Pakistan. Being ahead of its time did not do well commercially at the box office. The plot of the movie Aurat Raj is based on a short story of Shaukat Thanvi, where oppressed women of Pakistan fight back by forming feminist movement on roads and gain political power too. After gaining political power, in a satirical comedy fantasy scene, the lady leader protagonist gives a taste of patriarchy and misogyny to Pakistani men by converting all of them into women for some time. The fantastical scenarios, musical flights, and comedic twists in the film have also been hailed as interventionist tools and techniques that help complicate and refashion the present by envisioning radical futures. == Cast == Pakistani actress Rani played the main role of protagonist Soofia. == See also == * Aurat March * Me too movement in Pakistan * Girls at Dhabas *Sultana's Dream == References == Category:Feminism in Pakistan ",
