    "text": "The Battle of Rocoux took place on 11 October 1746 during the War of the Austrian Succession, at Rocourt or Rocoux, near Li\u00e8ge in modern Belgium. It featured a French army under Marshal Saxe and a combined British, Dutch, German and Austrian force led by Charles of Lorraine, John Ligonier and Prince Waldeck. The battle ended the 1746 campaign and the two armies went into winter quarters. France was struggling to finance the war and opened bilateral peace negotiations with Britain at the Congress of Breda in August 1746. Rocoux was a tactical success that confirmed French control of the Austrian Netherlands but Saxe failed to achieve the decisive victory needed to end the war. ==Background== When the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, Britain was still fighting the War of Jenkins' Ear with Spain; from 1739 to 1742, the main area of operations was in the Caribbean. British and Dutch troops initially fought as part of the army of Hanover; it was not until March 1744 that France formally declared war on Britain, while the Dutch Republic officially remained neutral until 1747. French victory at Fontenoy in April 1745 was followed by the capture of the key ports of Ostend, Ghent and Nieuport, while the 1745 Jacobite Rising forced Britain to transfer troops to Scotland. In the first months of 1746, the French took Louvain, Brussels and Antwerp; bolstered by these successes, Foreign Minister d'Argenson sent peace proposals to Britain. French battlefield victories in Flanders failed to achieve a decisive result, and the British hoped to retrieve their position. With the defeat of the Rising in April, Earl Ligonier returned from Scotland to assume command of the Hanoverian and British troops. However, only British subsidies kept their allies in the war. Austria's priority was to regain Silesia from Prussia; they acquired the Austrian Netherlands in 1713, only because neither the British or Dutch would allow the other to control it. The Dutch also wanted peace, since the fighting badly affected trade; these factors played an important role in the 1746 campaign that ended at Rocoux. ==Battle== Often referred to as Flanders, the Austrian Netherlands was a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, and dominated by canals and rivers. Until the 19th century, commercial and military goods were largely transported by water and wars in this theatre generally fought for control of rivers such as the Lys, Sambre and Meuse. Between February to July 1746, the French took Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven and Mons, then moved onto those along the Meuse, beginning with Charleroi (see Map). In mid-July, the Pragmatic Army prepared to defend Namur; leaving the Prince de Conti to finish with Charleroi, Saxe cut their supply lines, forcing them to retreat. By late September, Namur had fallen and the Allies moved to protect Li\u00e8ge, the next town on the Meuse. Anchored on the left by the Li\u00e8ge suburbs, the Allied line ran through Rocoux to the River Jeker; the Dutch under Waldeck held the left, the British and Germans in the centre and Austrians on the right. The French army made contact with the Austrian outposts around 18:00 on 10 October; they halted for the night and camped outside Li\u00e8ge. Knowing they were substantially outnumbered, Charles of Lorraine ordered the baggage train across the Meuse to allow an orderly retreat and Ligonier's troops fortified the villages of Rocoux, Varoux and Liers. Saxe decided to attack the Allied left and centre, leaving a small screening force to cover the Austrian sector, which was protected by a series of ditches and ravines. A night of heavy rain was followed by thick mist, delaying the French until 10:00 am. Their artillery opened fire on the British and Dutch positions, while two columns led by Clermont-Tonnerre and Lowendahl prepared a frontal attack. After the Li\u00e8ge authorities opened the gates, a third under de Contades moved through the town and outflanked Waldeck, who re- aligned his troops to face this threat. These movements meant the French assault did not begin until 15:00; the Dutch put up strong resistance, particularly around the village of Ance, which they finally lost after two hours of heavy fighting. Gentleman's Magazine Vol. XVI, 1746, page 542 Counter-attacks by the Dutch cavalry enabled their infantry to pull back in good order. Battle of Rocoux A second French attack was made against the British-German troops in the centre, who were driven out of their fortified positions in Rocoux and Vercoux, before regrouping further back. Although Von Zastrow retained Liers, the Dutch, British and German infantry withdrew towards the Meuse, covered by the Austrians, who had not been directly engaged. George II later criticised Charles of Lorraine for allegedly failing to support the British and Dutch, but Ligonier said he had acted in accordance with the plan agreed by the Allied leadership the night before. Saxe decided it was too late in the day to continue the attack, and allowed the Allies to retreat without interference. The British, Germans and Dutch crossed the Meuse on three pontoon bridges; the Austrians withdrew over the Jeker, then made for Maastricht. ==Aftermath== Although Rocoux led to the capture of Li\u00e8ge, and opened the way for an attack on the Dutch Republic, it once again failed to achieve a decisive victory. Led by the Marquis de Puisieux, France began bilateral negotiations with Britain at Breda in August 1746. These proceeded slowly, since the British envoy Lord Sandwich was under instructions to delay, hoping their position in Flanders would improve. In the January 1747 Hague Convention, Britain agreed to fund Austrian and Sardinian forces in Italy, and an Allied army of 140,000 in Flanders, increasing to 192,000 in 1748. However, by late 1746, Austrian forces had expelled Spanish Bourbon troops from Northern Italy and neither France nor Spain could afford to continue funding their campaign. With the removal of this threat, Maria Theresa of Austria wanted peace to restructure her administration and allegedly used her British subsidies to pay for infrastructure projects in Vienna. Hoping to retrieve the position in Flanders, the Duke of Newcastle persuaded his allies to make another attempt, which ended with defeat at Lauffeld in July 1747. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * Rocoux Rocoux Rocoux Rocoux Rocoux Rocoux Category:Battles in Wallonia Rocoux Category:1746 in Austria Category:1746 in France Category:1746 in Great Britain ",
