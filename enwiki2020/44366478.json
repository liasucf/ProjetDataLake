He was married to Brianda de Sant\u00e1ngel, niece of the banker Luis de Sant\u00e1ngel who financed the voyage of Christopher Columbus. Vinyoles was fluent in Catalan, Castilian Spanish, Latin, and Italian, even composing poems in Italian. Although he was a native Valencian/Catalan speaker, he praised the \"clean, elegant, and graceful Castilian Spanish\" and called his own native language \"a barbaric tongue\". For this, he has been reviled as \"the first traitor to the Valencian country and language\".Govert Westerveld, The Poem Scachs d'amor (1475): First Text of Modern Chess, pp. 88\u201390, Lulu.com, 2015 | .
