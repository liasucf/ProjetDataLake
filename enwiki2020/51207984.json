    "text": "The was a Japanese samurai clan of humble origins from the Inukami District of \u014cmi Province. During the Edo period, the T\u014dd\u014d ruled most of Ise Province and all of Iga Province as daimy\u014d (feudal lords) of Tsu Domain (320,000 koku) under the Tokugawa shogunate. The clan initially rose to prominence under T\u014dd\u014d Takatora (1556\u20131630), who was a highly trusted commander under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, as well as an architect of numerous Japanese castles. During the Bakumatsu period, the defection of the T\u014dd\u014d clan to the Satch\u014d Alliance in 1868 was a major factor in the defeat of the Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi. The head of the clan was later awarded with the kazoku title of Count (hakushaku) by the Meiji government. A junior branch of the clan, which ruled Hisai Domain in Ise Province (53,000 koku), was awarded the title of viscount (shishaku) in the Meiji period. Another junior branch of the clan, which ruled Nabari in Iga Province (15,000 koku), was not styled as a daimyo, but was awarded the title of baron (danshaku) in the Meiji period. ==References== * Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph.
