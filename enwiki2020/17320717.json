    "text": "Konrad Maria Eusebius Prinz zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (16 December 1863 \u2013 21 December 1918) was an Austrian aristocrat and statesman. He briefly served as Prime Minister of Austria (Cisleithania) in Austria\u2013Hungary in 1906. ==Life== Prince Konrad was born in Vienna, the son of Prince Konstantin of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (1828\u20131896), k.u.k. Chief Intendant and General of the Cavalry, and his wife Marie n\u00e9e Princess of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1837\u20131920), a daughter of Carolyne zu Sayn- Wittgenstein, known for her liaison with Franz Liszt. By his father, Konrad was a nephew of Victor I, Duke of Ratibor, of Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe- Schillingsf\u00fcrst (Chancellor of Germany 1894-1900), and of Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst. Prince Konrad attended the Schottengymnasium and went on to study law at the University of Vienna from 1883 to 1887. He entered the Cisleithanian civil service in Prague and later worked at the k.k. Ministry of the Interior. Appointed district officer (Bezirkshauptmann) in Teplitz-Sch\u00f6nau, Bohemia, he proved to be a man of conciliation and social justice, when he achieved settlement of a miners' strike and granted permission for performance of Hauptmann's socially critical play The Weavers, which earned him the nickname \"Red Prince\". In 1888 Prince Konrad married Countess Franziska of Sch\u00f6nborn-Buchheim (1866-1937). One of their six children, Princess Franziska of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (1897-1989), by her marriage with Archduke Maximilian Eugen of Austria, became the sister-in-law of Archduke Karl Franz of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria. Prince Hohenlohe with Georg Wassilko von Serecki in Berehomet, about 1903/04 In 1903/04, Prince Konrad served as k.k. Stadtholder (Steward) of the Bukovina in Czernowitz, and from 1904 as Stadtholder of the Austrian Littoral in Trieste. A confidant of the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was appointed Minister-President of Cisleithania on 2 May 1906, in order to push through an electoral reform establishing universal male suffrage in elections to the Imperial Council, where his predecessor Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn had failed. Prince Konrad tried to mobilize the votes of the Italian representatives in the Council against a \"Slavic\" block, but did not succeed in achieving a majority. He resigned within one month and returned to Trieste. It was left to his successor Max Wladimir von Beck to get the new electoral law passed. Prince Konrad remained Stadtholder of the Littoral until 1915. He had to cope with rising Italian irredentism and his measures of centralization in favour of the Vienna government met with strong protest. When the Kingdom of Italy threatened to join the Entente Powers, he resigned and temporarily joined the Imperial-Royal Landwehr forces on the Eastern Front. Back in Vienna he assumed the office of k.k. Minister of the Interior on 30 November 1915 in the cabinet of Minister-President Count Karl von St\u00fcrgkh. As minister, he evolved plans of re-arranging the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy into a federation of four major states: Austria proper, Hungary, Poland (Galicia), and \"Illyria\" (i.e. Croatia-Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia). However, those plans were rejected mainly by Hungarian politicians. Prince Konrad resigned as Interior Minister on 31 October 1916, shortly after Minister-President St\u00fcrgkh was assassinated by Friedrich Adler. From 2 December 1916 he served for three weeks as Joint Finance Minister of Austria-Hungary, before he was succeeded by Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz on 22 December. Also from 2 December he was a member of the Austrian House of Lords until its dissolution in November 1918. With the end of World War I he retired from politics, and died shortly afterwards while hunting in Kammern im Liesingtal, Styria. ==External links == * Hohenlohe on Encyclopedia of Austria * Hohenlohe on Austrian Commanders == See also == * Konstantin zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (de) * Marie zu Hohenlohe- Schillingsf\u00fcrst (de) * Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf\u00fcrst, Hohenlohe- Schillingsf\u00fcrst Category:1863 births Category:1918 deaths Category:20th- century Ministers-President of Austria Category:Politicians from Vienna Category:Politicians of Bukovina Category:Austro-Hungarian politicians Category:19th-century Austrian people Category:Ministers-President of Austria Category:Austrian people of German descent Konrad Category:Austrian princes Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Alexander (Bulgaria) Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (W\u00fcrttemberg) Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Red Eagle Category:Grand Crosses of the Albert Order ",
