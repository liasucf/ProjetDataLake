It was released by TMT Entertainment in Iceland on 11 March 2000, and then on 2 April 2001 in the United Kingdom. In 2005, M\u00fam performed the album live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. \"The Ballad of the Broken Birdie Records\" appears in the 2009 film Until the Light Takes Us. On 30 August 2019, Morr Music released a remastered 20th anniversary edition of Yesterday Was Dramatic \u2013 Today Is OK. The release featured newly commissioned reworkings of the album's songs as bonus tracks: a cover of \"Smell Memory\" by Kronos Quartet (with additional drums by M\u00fam's Samuli Kosminen), a reinterpretation of \"Random Summer\" by Hauschka, and a new version of \"Ballad of the Broken String\" by S\u00f3ley. ==Critical reception== Tim DiGravina of AllMusic wrote that M\u00fam \"proves to be as successful at creating emotional ambient electronic music\" and called Yesterday Was Dramatic \u2013 Today Is OK \"an unmitigated, accessible masterpiece\". Matt LeMay of Pitchfork deemed it \"one of the most deeply, purely emotionally affecting albums of the year\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Additional musicians *Eir\u00edkur Orri \u00d3lafsson \u2013 trumpet on track 6 *Helga Bj\u00f6rg Arnard\u00f3ttir \u2013 clarinet on tracks 3 and 6 *Stef\u00e1n M\u00e1r Magn\u00fasson \u2013 rhythm guitar on track 6 *Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir \u2013 strings on track 6 *Gr\u00f3a Margr\u00e9t Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 strings on track 6 *Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Geirsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 strings on track 6 Production *Finnur Bj\u00f6rnsson \u2013 mixing, recording *Finnur H\u00e1konarson \u2013 recording *M\u00fam \u2013 mixing, recording Design *Arnaldur Hilmisson \u2013 artwork *M\u00fam \u2013 artwork ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
