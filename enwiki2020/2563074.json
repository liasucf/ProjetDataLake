    "text": "Greg Gall (born December 29, 1965 in Tampa, Florida), was the drummer for the death metal band, Six Feet Under. He does not play the classic death metal style of drumming (blast beats). He uses more of a traditional drum approach, but with the addition of speed, and has very quick feet on the double bass pedals. Gall is married and has one child, and is the brother-in-law to bandmate Terry Butler. ==Discography== ===Six Feet Under=== * Haunted (1995) * Alive and Dead (1996) * Warpath (1997) * Maximum Violence (1999) * Graveyard Classics (2000) * True Carnage (2001) * Bringer of Blood (2003) * Graveyard Classics 2 (2004) * 13 (2005) * Commandment (2007) * Death Rituals (2008) * Graveyard Classics 3 (2010) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:American heavy metal drummers Category:Musicians from Tampa, Florida Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Six Feet Under (band) members Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
