    "text": "Hickling is a village in the Rushcliffe borough of Nottinghamshire, England. It is located close to the border with Leicestershire, approximately northwest of Melton Mowbray; the Vale of Belvoir is also nearby.map , rushcliffe.gov.uk It has a population of around 550, measured at 511 in the 2011 Census. The disused Grantham Canal passes through the village and there is a large basin adjacent to the main road. This would have facilitated loading and mooring when the canal was in use. The basin now attracts a substantial population of swans and ducks. Plans to put the canal back to water include the building of a swing bridge on the main road through the village. Like many bridges along the canal the original one has been flattened and therefore presently prevents navigation of the cut. Some nearby bridges, like the one elsewhere on this page, will need little work to put back to use. Further details of the plan for the area are available here: . Much of the village lies within a conservation area, which also contains 24 listed buildings. St Luke's Church dates from the 14th century. Inside the church can be found two ornate grave lids that were made for persons of importance and date from the tenth century. Roman coins and medals were found in an urn ploughed up nearby in 1771, and it is suspected that there may have been a Roman base nearby. Hickling residents are commended for their charity raising skills. The village holds an annual scarecrow festival over a weekend each September. Money raised at that event in 2009 along with the Hickling Country Fair, Open Gardens totalled over \u00a313,500. \u00a34,500 was handed over in February 2010, at a ceremony at the Plough Inn, to each of the Meningitis Trust, the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire Air Ambulance, and a further 14 village groups. The Plough is very much a focal point for the village providing good home produced food and a welcome atmosphere. The pub fields other activities including poker nights and, alternate Thursdays, open mic night ==Famous residents== American politician Fred M.
