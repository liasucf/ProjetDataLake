Gaur further explained: ==Reception== The film, which was showcased at the HIV Congress in Goa, has garnered a lot of positive reviews. Praising the film, The Times of India wrote that \"while there have been many awareness generation films, this one specifically educates people of the possibility of HIV victims having their own uninfected babies.
