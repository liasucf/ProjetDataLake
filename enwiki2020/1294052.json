It has been covered by a wide range of artists, including the Sex Pistols, who scored a number 3 hit with it in the UK Singles Chart in 1979. ==Eddie Cochran version== The first-person lyrics describe how Cochran wants a convertible he can not afford and a girl who he fears will not go out with him. But in the end, by saving money, he is able to buy an older car, and works up the confidence to ask the girl out. The song was written on the back of a match book. The song peaked at No. 22 on the UK Singles Chart, but only reached No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. ===Known personnel=== * Eddie Cochran: vocal, guitar, electric bass overdub * Earl Palmer: drums ===Chart performance=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1959) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- | |} ===Songwriting credit=== The songwriting credit shows Bob, not Bobby, Cochran.
