    "text": "Padre Jean (or Padrejean) was a slave on the island of Hispaniola. In 1676, he attempted to overthrow his slavemaster and consequently form a revolution. This occurred in the town of Port-de-Paix. This is stated to have been the spark that led to the eventual Haitian Revolution. He freed slaves and fled to Tortuga Island. He lived there until 1679 when his location was discovered. After this the French sent some maroons who killed him. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1670s deaths Category:People of Saint- Domingue Category:Haitian rebel slaves Category:Haitian Vodou practitioners ",
