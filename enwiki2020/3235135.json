A former chairman of the board was Senator Udoma U.Udoma when Mr Larry Ettah was serving as Group Managing Director and CEO in 2010. ==History== UAC Nigeria also known as UACN was first incorporated in Nigeria under the name Nigerian Motors Ltd on April 22, 1931 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Africa Company Ltd, the firm that later became UAC International (UACI). UAC International, a subsidiary of Unilever, included in its business, the trading activities formerly carried on by a number of other companies including The Niger Company Ltd. and the African and Eastern Trade Corporation Ltd, all of which had long-standing trading links with West Africa. ===Produce buying and merchandise trade period=== At inception, United Africa Company of Nigeria was a subsidiary of UACI's group of companies in Nigeria, a group that was incorporated to transact in selected markets within the country. Many of these companies later became divisions under UAC of Nigeria in 1973 following a consolidation exercise. UACN's business activities was initially in the auto trade market but soon expanded into other areas. Strategic to its business conduct in Nigeria, the firm believed in the development of the economy and an improvement in the income of farmers and Nigerians as key to its success, this belief partly motivated its drive to expand into other areas of business. A major segment of the firm was produce buying of cash crops from local farmers for export to foreign markets. This activity also involved extension of credit to traders and middlemen who went into the hinterland to source for quality grades of produce. The firm operated in this market through staffing of personnel at different buying stations or through the use of traders and middlemen. When marketing boards were created for major cash crops such as palm kernels, Cocoa and groundnuts, UAC of Nigeria was appointed as one of the licensed buying agents. The company also traded in other agricultural products not regulated by the government such as hides and skins, beeswax, rubber, shea nut, castor seed, piassava, kapok, coffee, copra and gum. The revenue from the sale of agricultural produce was used to import various goods for sale in the Nigerian market. The firm's trade in consumer goods such as shirts, shoes, electrical appliances and mechanical equipment involved importation from various countries of the world, a process overseen by its parent company. Many goods distributed by the company were sold by middlemen or associate companies such as Kingsway Stores. The firm also managed transportation of bulk palm oil at buying points and storage at various ports in the country for onward distribution to foreign markets. The firm had a fleet of river crafts operating within the internal water ways of the country, an operation that was managed out of UAC's office at Burutu. In addition, the firm helped to introduce new machinery for many pioneer oil mills in Eastern Nigeria. ===Restructuring period=== The company, whose name was changed to United Africa Company Ltd in 1943, retained the name until 1955 when it became The United Africa Company of Nigeria Ltd and started acquiring, over a period of five years, a large part of the business of UAC International. In 1960 C.W.A. Holdings Ltd, England also a subsidiary of Unilever, acquired the interest of UAC International in the company. Further re-organisation concluded in 1973 and resulted in the acquisition of a number of wholly owned fellow subsidiaries of C.W.A. Holdings. In 1968, Niger House, the new head office of UACN was completed. The 12 storey building was built by Taylor Woodrow and has adjacent structures including an 8-storey building at the rear. Following re- organisation, the company conducted the acquired businesses as operating divisions, which are now in voluntary liquidation. The company took the name UAC of Nigeria Ltd in 1973. In compliance with the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Act 1972, 40 percent of the company's share capital was acquired in 1974 by Nigerian citizens and associations and in accordance with the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Act 1977, an additional 20 percent of the UAC's share capital was publicly offered in 1977, increasing Nigerian equity participation to 60 percent. The name UACN Plc was adopted in 1991. ==Historical divisions== From 1973 onwards, UACN managed many of the Nigerian assets of its parent company..

The first Kingsway store was opened in Lagos in 1948 and by 1982, the firm had 13 stores across major cities in the country including a three-storey store at Ibadan. The stores initially provided access to consumer goods found in departmental stores of foreign countries, but over time, majority of its SKUs were procured in Nigeria. Towards the end of the 1980s, price and currency regulations and a downturn in the economy forced the closure of many stores and eventually the closure of Kingsway Stores. ===Textiles=== UAC's textile division was one of the largest textile distributors in Nigeria. The division was formed as combination of the textile businesses of UAC and G.B Ollivant. At its height the company designed and distributed wax prints. ===A.J. Seward=== A.J.

Between 1945 and 1951, additional investments were poured into the facility. A plywood mill was commissioned in 1948 and the old mill was replaced in 1951. Major sources of wood were Iroko and Mahogany trees with one species known as Sapele mahogany. Initially the products of the mills were mostly for foreign markets but an expanding local market caused an inwards focus to generate sales. The products of the firm included cresta branded plywood, ATAPEX particle board, flushed doors and furniture. ===Federated motors=== Federated Motors assembled Bedford trucks from completely knocked down parts.
