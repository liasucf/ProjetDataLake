    "text": "The Peugeot Pars () also known as Peugeot Persia is an Iran Khodro product. After 10 years of manufacturing Peugeot 405 in Iran Khodro company, Peugeot Persia was designed as a facelift of the 405. Peugeot Persia was soon renamed to Peugeot Safir and eventually Peugeot Pars because of local copyright problems. Peugeot Pars had been made in three models Pars, Pars 16V, and Pars ELX. The 16V and ELX models use a more powerful PSA 16 valve engine and a few extra facilities. ==Engine== The PSA-borrowed engine is XU7JP (code LFZ, known as L3 in Iran) 1.8 L SOHC with 2 valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 101 PS (74 kW) at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 153 Nm (15.6 kgf m / 113 ft\u00b7lbf) at 3000 rpm which is controlled by SAGEM SL96 ECU. The same engine was already in use in the PSA's Peugeot 405 1.8 SR, Peugeot 306 1.8i 8v, Citro\u00ebn Xantia 1.8i 8v, and Citro\u00ebn Xsara 1.8i 8v. ==Peugeot Pars 16V== Not as equipped as ELX, this model was simply an upgraded version of Pars in aspects of engine and rear brakes. The 16V employed a more powerful 16 valve engine, and rear disc brakes, but ABS was not available even as an option. The 16V model's production lasted less than a year; began on the second quarter of 2003 and ended on the first quarter of 2004 (making them 1382 model year based on Persian calendar), the same time it was replaced with the ELX model. Many Iranian car industry critics believe its production was a case study of the Iranian car market capacity performed by Iran Khodro before beginning the production of ELX to see if people are seeking for more powerful and luxurious versions of Pars. As an improvement to Pars, the 16V utilizes solid disc brakes on rear wheels, but unlike the ELX which is equipped with an advanced ABS/EBD, the 16V model uses the same vacuum booster, master cylinder, distributor, and hydraulic lines as the standard Pars. The more powerful LFY engine fitted to the 16V models grabbed the interest of the authorities who are always seeking for high-performance yet inexpensive cars as service vehicles. A large number of 16Vs were produced according to requests registered by Iranian governmental organizations. 16Vs can be seen as parliament service cars and also motorcade escorts. ==Peugeot Pars ELX== Peugeot Pars ELX Comparing to Pars, the ELX features smart instrument cluster, multi-purpose Persian-reading dashboard telematics, alarm with door auto-lock, park assistant, electric Recaro cloth seats equipped with heater/cooling fan, luxury dashboard trim, passenger illuminated vanity mirror, a more powerful 16 valve engine, 4-disc brakes with ABS/EBD, and finally rally alloy wheels. The PSA-borrowed engine is XU7JP4 (code LFY, known as L4 in Iran) 1.8 L DOHC with 4 hydraulically adjusted valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 109.0 bhp (81.3 kW / 110.5 PS) at 5500 rpm and a maximum torque of 155.0 N\u00b7m (15.8 kgf\u00b7m / 114 ft\u00b7lbf) at 4250 rpm which is controlled by Bosch Motronic MP 7.3 ECU. The same engine was already in use in the PSA's Peugeot 406 LX 1.8i 16v, Citro\u00ebn Xantia SX 1.8i 16v, and Citro\u00ebn Xsara VTS 1.8i 16v. The ABS/EBD-featured MK20-E servo-assisted dual-circuit brake system is partially manufactured by Iranian Toklan Toos under license of Continental Teves. It is coupled to ventilated discs on front and solid discs on rear wheels. Front single-piston calipers are also manufactured by Toklan Toos under license of Lucas-TVS and rear single-piston calipers are manufactured by Girling. The Italian-made rally light-weight one-piece flow-formed cast aluminium wheels are provided by Speedline Corse; the manufacturer claims these Turini (type 2120) wheels are FEA-cast in low pressure, heat-treated, low-weight, and designed in accordance with latest FIA regulations for tarmac rally Super 1600 kit cars. The 11-spoke wheel has a diameter of 15 inches, a section width of 7 inches, a bolt pattern of 4 x 108 mm (4 x 4.25\"), an ET of 38 millimeters, and is attached to the ELX's hub applying four 19 mm lugs. ==Peugeot Pars LX== The PSA-borrowed engine is TU5JP4 (code NFU, known as TU5 in Iran) 1.6 L DOHC with 4 valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 109 PS (80 kW) at 5800 rpm and a maximum torque of 142 Nm (14.47 kgf m / 104.73 ft\u00b7lbf) at 4000 rpm which is controlled by Crouse Or Bosch ECU. The same engine was already in use in the PSA's Peugeot 206 1.6 16v TU5, Peugeot 405 SLX 1.6 16v TU5, Runna 1.6 16v TU5, and . ==References== ==External links== *Iran Khodro official website Category:Cars of Iran Category:Front- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:2000s cars Category:Iran Khodro vehicles ",
