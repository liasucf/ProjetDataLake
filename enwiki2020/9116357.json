Their objective was to recognize the individual contributions of many groups from the Western Frontier. Included in these groups are peoples Hispanic, Native American, European, Asian, and African descent. Many of these people have stories that only this organization will tell. The organization was renamed to its present name in 2008 to better encompass the varied history of the museum. == About the museum == The museum is located at 2029 N Main Street, Fort Worth, Texas 76164.
