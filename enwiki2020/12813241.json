    "text": "\"Zoom\" is a single by American rappers Dr. Dre and LL Cool J, recorded for and taken from the soundtrack to the film Bulworth. ==Background== The track was produced by Dre. This is only song that both rappers collaborated on. It uses a sample from Quincy Jones' song, \"Ironside\". Additionally, the verse \"I got my mind made up, come on, come on, get in, get in to it, let it ride, tonight's the night\" is from 'Got My Mind Made Up' by 2Pac. Additionally, the instrumental was originally recorded and intended for the Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre collaboration album 'Break Up To Make Up'. However, the project was scrapped. The beat was then used for King Tee for his semi-unreleased album 'Thy Kingdom Come', on the track \"6 N' Na Moe'nin\", featuring the vocals of Dawn Robinson. Again, the album was shelved and the song was re-recorded featuring LL Cool J. The original version featuring Snoop Dogg can be found on the internet in low quality, as can the King Tee version. ==Track listing== * CD singlehttp://www.discogs.com/Dr-Dre-LL-Cool-J-Zoom/release/636665\"Zoom\" information and track listing.
