With Montreal already eliminated and the Vancouver Whitecaps leading the table, Toronto FC needed to win by 4 or more goals to capture its first Voyageurs Cup and a berth in the 2009\u201310 CONCACAF Champions League. ==Match== Tony Donatelli gave Montreal a 1\u20130 lead early in the first half on a penalty kick which meant Toronto needed 5 or more goals to beat Vancouver on goal differential. Toronto went on to score 6 unanswered goals, including 3 straight from captain Dwayne De Rosario on route to capturing the 2009 Canadian Championship and a place in the CONCACAF Champions League. The 6\u20131 defeat was the worst in Montreal's franchise history at the time. ===Details=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} ==Aftermath== Toronto FC would go on to lose to Puerto Rico Islanders in the preliminary round of 2009\u201310 CONCACAF Champions League. The match was a significant moment in shaping the rivalry between Montreal Impact and Toronto FC. In 2011, Montreal Impact officially joined Major League Soccer becoming the third Canadian team to do so after Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. This only furthered the rivalry which became known as the 401 derby and later the Canadian Classique. Montreal would get retribution against Toronto, beating them 6\u20130 in the same venue during the 2013 Canadian Championship. This remains the largest margin of victory in Canadian Classique history. ==See also== *Canadian Classique *Canadiens\u2013Maple Leafs rivalry ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== *Match highlights Category:Toronto FC matches Category:Montreal Impact matches Category:Canadian soccer club matches ",
