    "text": "More Deep Cuts is the second studio album by American indie rock band Thee More Shallows. It was originally released on Monotreme Records in 2004. It was re-released on Turn Records in 2005. Later printings were released with an alternative cover. ==Critical reception== Mark Keresman of East Bay Express gave the album a favorable review, saying: \"Whereas most bands can be described and/or dismissed with a few words, Thee More Shallows defy such classification by truly integrating diverse influences into their approach. He added: \"Instead of dynamic, grab-you hooks, TMS' melodies faintly insinuate themselves into your psyche via cyclic structures, shimmering orchestrations, and judicious feedback/noise.\" Chris Whibbs of Exclaim! said: \"The title really does get to the heart of the album as these subtle, slow and beautiful stories leave much more than a scratch upon your mind.\" ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2004 albums Category:Thee More Shallows albums ",
