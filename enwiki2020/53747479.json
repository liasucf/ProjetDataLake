    "text": "The Boot Boys was a Norwegian far-right neo-Nazi organization from B\u00f8ler, a suburban area of Oslo, with connections to individuals in Bergen and Kristiansand. Consisting of about 50 members, it was considered one of the most violent neo-Nazi groups in Norway. They were founded in the midst of the 1990s and were active for many years. The group was known for having racist and xenophobic attitudes. When the neo-Nazi environment in B\u00f8ler was at its strongest in the autumn of 2000, it consisted of 10 to 12 uniformed young men who controlled a small area in the community. They were marching in the streets, painted swastikas on school walls, drank beer behind the shopping mall and occupied lake N\u00f8klevann in the evenings. Daniel de Linde was one of the groups' leading members. Other members included Joe Erling Jahr and Ole Nicolai Kvisler, who was convicted of the murder of Benjamin Hermansen on 26 January 2001.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/18/andrewosborn ==References== Category:History of Oslo Category:Neo-Nazi organizations Category:Neo-Nazism in Norway Category:Racism in Norway Category:1990s establishments in Norway ",
