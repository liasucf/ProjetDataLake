Klamath plum, Sierra plum The range of Prunus subcordata surrounds the San Joaquin Valley, especially the western flank foothills of the Sierra Nevada range, but avoids the coast mountains of the southwest San Joaquin Valley. For other Pacific coastal Prunus species, P. emarginata is also found in the Pacific Northwest states; P. fremontii and P. ilicifolia are found in coastal or mountain areas of southwest California and northern Baja California. ==Plant description== Prunus subcordata is an erect deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 8 m (nearly 27 feet) in height. It sprouts from its roots and can form dense, spiny thickets. The bark is gray with horizontal brown lenticels, similar in appearance to that of the cultivated cherry tree. The leaves are 2.5\u20135 cm (1-2 inches) long with a 4\u201315 mm (0.16-0.60 inch) petiole, dark green, turning red before falling, and are faintly toothed. The flowers are white or pinkish, appearing in the spring in clusters of one to seven together. The fruit is a small, plum-like drupe, variable in appearance, 15\u201325 mm (0.60-1.00 inch) in length, and may be red or yellow; they mature in late summer. The plums are small and tart but edible.Casebeer, M. (2004). Discover California Shrubs. Sonora, California: Hooker Press. Flora of North America, Prunus subcordata Bentham, 1849.
