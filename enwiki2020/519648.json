    "text": "Alfred Sherwood Romer (December 28, 1894 \u2013 November 5, 1973) was an American paleontologist and biologist and a specialist in vertebrate evolution. ==Biography== Alfred Romer was born in White Plains, New York, the son of Harry Houston Romer and his wife, Evalyn Sherwood. He was educated at White Plains High School. He studied at Amherst College achieving a Bachelor of Science Honours degree in biology and Columbia University pursuing with a M.Sc in Biology and graduating with a doctorate in zoology in 1921. Romer joined the department of geology and paleontology at the University of Chicago as an associate professor in 1923. He was an active researcher and teacher. His collecting program added important Paleozoic specimens to the Walker Museum of Paleontology. In 1934 he was appointed professor of biology at Harvard University. In 1946, he also became director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). In 1954 Romer was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Academy's Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal in 1956. In 1961, Romer received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. ==Evolutionary research== Romer was very keen in investigating vertebrate evolution. Comparing facts from paleontology, comparative anatomy, and embryology, he taught the basic structural and functional changes that happened during the evolution of fishes to primitive terrestrial vertebrates and from these to all other tetrapods. He always emphasized the evolutionary significance of the relationship between the form and function of animals and the environment. Through his textbook Vertebrate Paleontology Romer laid the foundation for the traditional classification of vertebrates. He drew together the (then) widely scattered taxonomy of the different vertebrate groups and combined them in a simplified scheme, emphasizing orderliness and overview. Based on his research of early amphibians, he reorganised the labyrinthodontians.\"Romer, Alfred Sherwood.\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. Retrieved May 25, 2011 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905302.html Romer's classification was followed by many subsequent authors, notably Robert L. Carroll, and is still in use. ==Kronosaurus queenslandicus skeleton== K. queenslandicus at Harvard University which may have been reconstructed with too many vertebrae Prior to Romer's tenure as MCZ director, the Museum sent an expedition to Australia in 1931\u20131932 to gather specimens and study live animals. Yet then-graduate student William E. Schevill, the team's fossil enthusiast, remained in Australia beyond the venture and, in the winter of 1932, was told by the rancher R.W.H. Thomas of rocks with something \"odd\" poking out of them on his property near Hughenden.Mather, Patricia, with Agnew, N.H. et al.

The skull\u2014which matched the holotype jaw fragment of K. queenslandicus\u2014was prepared right away, but time and budget constraints put off restoration of the nearly complete skeleton - most of the bones of which remained unexcavated within the limestone blocks - for 20 years. This interim ended when they came to the attention of Godfrey Lowell Cabot - Boston industrialist, philanthropist, and founder of the Cabot Corporation - \"who was then in his nineties had been interested in sea serpents since childhood.\" K. queenslandicus scale diagram, showing the size of the restored Harvard skeleton along with a more accurate estimate Having formerly question Dr. Romer about the existence and reports of sea serpents and it thus occurred to Romer to tell Mr. Cabot about the skeleton in the museum closet. Godfrey Cabot thus asked how much a restoration would cost and \"Romer, pulling a figure out of the musty air, replied, 'Oh, about $10,000.'\" Romer may not have been serious but the philanthropist clearly was because the check for said sum came shortly thereafter.The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (Hardcover) \u2013 October 26, 2004 Two years - and more than $10,000 - later, following the careful labor of the museum preparators, the restored and mounted skeleton was displayed at Harvard in 1959. However, Dr. Romer and MCZ preparator Arnold Lewis confirmed that same year in the institution's journal Breviora that \"erosion had destroyed a fair fraction of this once complete and articulated skeleton...so that approximately a third of the specimen as exhibited is plaster restoration.\"Romer, A. S. and A. D. Lewis. 1959. A mounted skeleton of the giant plesiosaur Kronosaurus. Breviora 112:1-15. Furthermore, the original (real) bones are also layered in plaster; a fact that, while keeping the fossils safe, makes it difficult for paleontologists to study it - an issue which factors into the controversial question of the true size of the Kronosaurus queenslandicus. ===Size issues=== Body-length estimates, largely based on the 1959 Harvard reconstruction, had previously put the total length of Kronosaurus at .Romer AS, Lewis AD. 1959. A mounted skeleton of the giant plesiosaur Kronosaurus. Breviora 112: 1-15. However, more recent studies, comparing fossil specimens of Kronosaurus to other pliosaurs suggests that the Harvard reconstruction may have included too many vertebrae, exaggerating the previous estimate, with the true length probably only .Kear BP. 2003.

Web. ==Namesakes== ===Taxonomic patronyms=== In honor of Alfred Romer, several taxonomic patronyms were given in animals: * Romeriida is the name for a clade that contains the diapsids and their closest relatives. * Romeria is a genus of early captorhinids. * Romeriscus is a genus from the early Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) initially described as the oldest known amniote, but this is because limnoscelids were, at that time, considered amniotes by some authors. A subsequent study showed that the fossil lacks diagnostic characters and can only be assigned to Tetrapoda. * Dromomeron romeri is a species of non-dinosaurian dinosauromorph named in July 2007. The genus name means 'running femur,' and the species name honors the paleontologist, a key figure in evolution research. The finding of these fossils was hailed as a breakthrough proving dinosaurs and other dinosauromorphs \"lived together for as long as 15 to 20 million years.\" ===Romer's gap=== Romer was the first to recognise the gap in the fossil record between the tetrapods of the Devonian and the later Carboniferous period, a gap that has borne the name Romer's gap since 1995. ===Romerogram=== A romerogram of the vertebrates at class level, with the width of spindles indicating number of families. A romerogram, also called spindle diagram, or bubble diagram, is a diagram popularised by Alfred Romer. It represents taxonomic diversity (horizontal width) against geological time (vertical axis) in order to reflect the variation of abundance of various taxa through time. ==Books== *Romer, A.S. 1933.
