He also played for Gillingham, Chester City, Rochdale and Swindon Town, where he spent the last eight years of his playing career before hanging up his boots in 2006, also as a player/coach, before becoming assistant manager. Reeves served as assistant manager for Brentford, from where he left with manager Scott Fitzgerald on 10 April 2007 after the club's relegation. He interviewed for the vacant Crawley Town manager role in May 2007, but was unsuccessful in receiving the job, reportedly due to differences with then chairman James Moore.
