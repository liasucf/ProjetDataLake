    "text": "Wish I Was All Flames is the second studio full-length album by the Montreal- based instrumental shoegaze band Destroyalldreamers, released on October 23, 2007, on Where Are My records. In December 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold ranked Wish I Was All Flames No. 8 on their 2007 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame. ==Release history== Recording for the album took place over the course of 18 months in 2005 and 2006, while the band was also recording its EP Glare/Halo for a different record label. The two albums share a few tracks: \"A Summer Without You\" and the three-part composition \"Her Brother Played the Riot\", presented as a single track on the EP. Percussions were recorded by Shane Whitbread in February 2005 and Martin Valence in June 2005, in Chambly and Montreal respectively, while the remaining instruments were recorded in Montreal at Thisquietarmy HQ and the Studio du Carr\u00e9 Rouge from 2005 to September 2006. The album would therefore have been ready for a release in fall 2006, but bass guitarist Mich\u00e8le Martin's departure from the band at that time delayed the post-production process, while also compromising the possibility of a supporting tour. It was later announced on the group's MySpace blog that the release was going to take place in October 2007 and that it would be supported by a small-scale tour,Destroyalldreamer's MySpace Blog Entry Concerning Album and Tour, Retrieved 2010-04-07 since the band had recruited a friend to assume the bass guitarist position.Biography at Official Destroyalldreamers Website, Retrieved 2010-04-07 On October 21, 2007, they performed a launch show to celebrate the release at the Montreal music venue Divan Orange.
