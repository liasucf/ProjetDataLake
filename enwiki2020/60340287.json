    "text": "The Sierra County Sheriff's Gallows, at Galloway Rd. and Courthouse Sq. in Downieville, California in Sierra County, California, was built in 1885. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is a tall structure, about in plan. It was not designed to be permanent, but rather was designed to be dismantled, stored, and reassembled as needed. Its only use, however, was in 1885. Law changes in 1891 prevented its further usage. It is built mainly of wood, with a metal trap door and mechanism. In 1988 the gallows was restored.
