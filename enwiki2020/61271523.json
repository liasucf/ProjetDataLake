These names were attributed to remarkable events around birth. Later in life a person might be given a new name relating to subsequent events. == 1800\u20131900 == With the arrival of Europeans, surnames were introduced and soon after a M\u0101ori surname system was devised where a person would take their father's name as a surname, for example: :Ariki \u2013 Maunga Ariki \u2013 Waiora Maunga \u2013 Te Awa Waiora \u2013 Waipapa Te Awa M\u0101ori would also have translations of their names, for example: :John Te Awa \u2013 Hone River \u2013 John River \u2013 Hone Waipapa Te Awa \u2013 John Waipapa Te Awa \u2013 Hone Waipapa \u2013 John Waipapa == References == Naming customs Maori ",
