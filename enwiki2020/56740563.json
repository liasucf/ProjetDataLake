    "text": "Carol Flax is an artist who has worked in both theater and film, and marketing and communications. She retired and moved to Cape Cod (2013). She has been using the surrounding landscapes to create her \u201cCut Paper Mosaics\u201d which is the main medium for her relatively new life as a professional artist. Current Residency and Works: Professional Affiliations: Elected Member, Audubon Artists, Inc., Past President of the Society of Cape Cod Craftsmen Where Work is Displayed: The Rice Gallery at Woodruff Art Center, Mashpee Commons, Mashpee, MA October 8, 2017: Creative Hands Gallery, Sandwich, MA == Education == Flax attended Heidelberg College and earned a BA in English, in addition to receiving an MA in Speech & Theater from the University of Michigan. == Artistry == === Technique === Flax is considered a visual artist for her work in representational collage. This is a style that she created in her twenties, but did not receive any recognition for at the time. The artist describes her own process, calling it \u201cCut Paper Mosaics,\" where she essentially recycles paper from materials such as magazines. She then cuts the paper and glues pieces to her surface of choice, often a collage board, using a brush-stroke pattern to create the illusion of a painting. === Influence === While aspirations of an early art career did not work out for Flax, she kept the idea of Cut Paper Mosaics in the back of her mind. Eventually when she retired to Cape Cod in 2013, she revived and refined this idea and began her career as a professional artist. Now she plays with the idea of \"upcycling\" to turn used paper into art. Additionally, Flax enjoys creating her works to resemble paintings in an attempt to fool viewers when they first encounter her work. She enjoys the aspect of searching for the colors and textures she needs for each landscape. Flax is an Elected Member of Audubon Artists, Inc. (at the Salmagundi Club, NYC); and artist member of: Fuller Craft Museum, the Cotuit Center for the Arts, the Sandwich Arts Alliance and the Arts Foundation of Cape Cod. == Awards == Most notably, Flax received the Audubon Artists Silver Medal of Honor in 2016 for her collage Mayflower Beach iii. Additionally, she won the Work on Paper Prize for her painting Gray\u2019s Beach Low Tide in the 2014 National Prize Show, juried by James Welu. == References == Category:Living people Category:American women artists Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
