In term of manuscripts, it denotes a special form of a book whose cover is elongated. Thus when the book is opened, it resembles a long vessel. In Persian use, 'safineh' is a synonym for 'jong' () which means a collection of essays or poems. == Discovery and scope == Based on the manuscript, the book has been published in facsimile by Tehran University Press.Abu'l majd Muhammad ibn Masu'd Tabrizi. Safineh-ye Tabriz: A treastury of Persian literature. Tehran University Press, 2001 As it constitutes a rare Islamic manuscript that has recently been discovered, it has generated a great deal of interest among Islamic, Iranian and Middle Eastern scholars. It is almost perfectly preserved, and contains 209 works on a wide range of subjects, in Persian and Arabic as well as some poetry denoted by Fahlaviyat and the Iranian language of Tabriz. According to Professors A. A. Seyed-Gohrab and S. McGlinn, The Safineh: is indeed a whole treasure-house, compressed between two covers. One of the important features of the Safinah is that it contains works of a number of philosophers who were not known until the discovery of the manuscript. The texts of the Safina-yi Tabrizi contain separate chapters covering S.A. Al-e Davud, A Review of the Treatises and Historical Documents in Saf\u012bna-ye Tabr\u012bz in: Seyed-Gohrab, A. A. & S.

Also here: ==Debates of inanimate objects== Interesting debates between various objects constitute some of the articles of the Safina. In each of these debates, each object boasts of its own quality relative to its opponent while attempting to belittle their opponents. Through these abstractions of inanimate objects, the authors use both poetry and composition to convey moral and philosophical lessons. The following listed articles all in Persian are the debates between the inanimate objects.
