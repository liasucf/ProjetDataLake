She has been co- chairperson of The Left since 2012, alongside Bernd Riexinger. == Early life and career == Kipping was born on 18 January 1978 in Dresden, then part of East Germany (GDR). After completing her Abitur in 1996 at Annen-Gymnasium, Kipping spent a voluntary social year in Gatchina, Russia. Following this, she completed a degree in Slavic studies, with a minor in American studies and public law, at the Dresden University of Technology, from which she obtained her Master of Arts degree in 2003. Kipping currently splits her time between Berlin and Dresden.S\u00e4chsische Zeitung vom 28. Dezember 2012 She is married, and has a daughter. == Political career == At the start of her studies at the Dresden University of Technology, Kipping was heavily involved with the so- called Protestb\u00fcro (bureau of protest). In 1998, she became a member of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the forerunner of today's Left party. She was elected to the city council of Dresden, capital of Saxony, serving from 1999 to 2003. She was elected to the Landtag of Saxony for PDS in the 1999 state election, and served until the 2004 election. During this time, she was the party's spokesperson for traffic and energy policy. In July 2003, she became deputy chairperson of PDS, focusing on the party's \"social agenda\" and \"contact with social movements\". She was a principal proponent of a united left party, comprising the east-oriented PDS and the west-oriented Labour and Social Justice (WASG). In 2005, Kipping was elected to the Bundestag, on the joint PDS\u2013WASG electoral list. The two parties merged to form The Left on 16 June 2007, and Kipping was elected deputy chairperson of the new party. In 2009, she was re-elected to the Bundestag, on The Left's list. In January 2012, Der Spiegel reported that Kipping was one of 27 members of The Left's parliamentary group who were under surveillance by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz). On 2 June 2012, delegates at the third national party conference elected her as one of the party's two chairpersons, with 67% of the vote. Since then, she has led the party, along with Bernd Riexinger.Kipping und Riexinger f\u00fchren tief zerstrittene Linke Spiegel Online, 2 June 2012. Accessed on 3 June 2012Wahl des Parteivorstandes.
