That day he teamed up with Idiro; Manol\u00ed, Pasar\u00edn, Hermida, Rivera, Basterrechea, Reigosa, Hilario, Polo, and P\u00e9rez, being accompanied by several friends of his club, the Real Club Celta de Vigo. The match ended tied 0-0, and the great striker Rogelio could not drill the opposing goal. His best year was the 1926-27 campaign, in which he scored 36 goals in 23 matches. But his global numbers are the ones that are highlighted with golden letters in the pages of the club history. Rogelio Tapia scored 119 goals in 113 official matches with Celta, averaging 1.05 goals per match. Stratospheric numbers, making him the all-time best player in the club's history.

The record lives on in Celta's history soccer player with the best goalscoring average, scoring one goal every 85 minutes. ==References== ==External links== Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:Galician footballers Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Spanish footballers ",
