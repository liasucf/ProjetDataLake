    "text": "Harvey Lavan \"Van\" Cliburn Jr. (; July 12, 1934February 27, 2013) was an American pianist who achieved worldwide recognition in 1958, at the age of 23, when he won the inaugural quadrennial International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition in Moscow during the Cold War. ==Recording career== Upon Cliburn's return to the United States, RCA Victor signed him to an exclusive contract and his subsequent recording of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance. It was certified a gold record in 1961, and it became the first classical album to go platinum, achieving that certification in 1989.RIAA Gold and Platinum database retrieved 26 February 2017 ==List of recordings== Most of Van Cliburn's recordings were originally issued on LP records, with some also issued on reel-to-reel, cassette, and 8-track tapes. Many of Cliburn's recordings were reissued on Compact Disc when that format became available in the 1980s, in remasterings of variable quality. Shortly before Cliburn's death, Sony Classical (which owns the RCA Victor Red Seal archives) released a newly remastered, Original Jacket Collection style boxed set, including Cliburn's complete RCA Victor recordings, with the exception of LSC-2807, Cliburn's sole recording as a conductor. A number of recordings, mostly originating from live concerts, have been issued on some smaller labels, including Testament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:6%;\"|Year of issue ! style=\"width:50%;\"|Album title and details ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Recording date(s) ! style=\"width:10%;\"|LP catalog no. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|Record label |- |1958 |Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1 *Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, Op. 23 **RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra / Kirill Kondrashin, conductor |May 30, 1958 |LSC-2252 |RCA |- |1959 |Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 3 *Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30 **Symphony of the Air / Kirill Kondrashin, conductor |May 19, 1958 |LSC-2355 |RCA |- |1960 |Schumann Concerto *Schumann: Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54 **Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Fritz Reiner, conductor |April 16, 1960 |LSC-2455 |RCA |- |1961 |Prokofiev and MacDowell Concertos *Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 3 in C major, Op. 26 *MacDowell: Piano Concerto No. 2 in D minor, Op. 23 ** Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Walter Hendl, conductor |October, 1960 |LSC-2507 |RCA |- |1961 |Beethoven \u201cEmperor\u201d Concerto *Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73 **Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Fritz Reiner, conductor | |May, 1961 |LSC-2562 |RCA |- |1961 |My Favorite Chopin *Chopin: Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53 \"Heroic\" / Nocturne in B major, Op. 62, No. 1 / Fantasie in F minor, Op. 49 / Etude in A minor, Op. 25, No. 11 \"Winter Wind\" / Etude in E major, Op. 10, No. 3 / Ballade in A-flat major, Op. 47 / Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64, No. 2 / Scherzo in C-sharp minor, Op. 39 |May, 1961 |LSC-2576 |RCA |- |1962 |Brahms Concerto No. 2 *Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 83 **Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Fritz Reiner, conductor / Robert La Marchina, cello solo |May, 1961 |LSC-2581 |RCA |- |1962 |Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 2 *Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18 **Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Fritz Reiner, conductor |March\u2013April, 1962 |LSC-2601 |RCA |- |1963 |Beethoven Concerto No. 4 *Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, Op. 58 **Chicago Symphony Orchestra / Fritz Reiner, conductor |April, 1963 |LSC-2680 |RCA |- |1964 |Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 *Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15 **Boston Symphony Orchestra, / Erich Leinsdorf, conductor |March, 1964 |LSC-2724 |RCA |- |1965 |Van Cliburn Conducts *Vaughan Williams: Serenade to Music **Interlochen Youth Orchestra and Chorus / Van Cliburn, conductor |August, 1964 |LSC-2807 |RCA |- |1966 |Beethoven: \u201cLes Adieux\u201d Sonata, Mozart, Sonata in C *Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 26 in E-flat major, Op. 81a \"Les Adieux\" *W.
