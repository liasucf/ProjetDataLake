    "text": "Brigitte Eisenmann (10 April 1942 \u2013 26 April 2011) was a German chemist and a professor at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. She was the first woman professor for Chemistry at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. Together with Herbert Sch\u00e4fer, she extended the definition of Zintl phases. == Life == Eisenmann studied Chemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. She finished her dissertation \"Zur Strukturchemie bin\u00e4rer und tern\u00e4rer Verbindungen von Erdalkalimetallen mit Elementen der IV. Hauptgruppe\" in the group of Armin Weiss in 1971. Shortly after, she started researching in the newly established group of Herbert Sch\u00e4fer (chemist) at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. Together with him, she performed research on Zintl phases. At first, Eisenmann worked as a research assistant. A year later, she worked as a Dozentin. Three years later, she became Akademische Oberr\u00e4tin. In 1986, Herbert Sch\u00e4fer died and Eisenmann continued their joint work. Furthermore, she established her own research profile. In 1990, she habilitated with the work \"Zintlphasen mit komplexen Anionen\". She later became an extraordinary professor. She was the first woman professor for Chemistry at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. She also contributed to the Landolt\u2013B\u00f6rnstein. == Research == She discovered the Si4\u2212 butterfly anion in Ba3Si4 during her work on her dissertation. Furthermore, she and Herbert Sch\u00e4fer extended the definition of Zintl phases: In their definition, Zintl phases are intermetallic compounds with a pronounced heteropolar bonding contribution. Furthermore, their anion partial lattices should obey the (8-N) rule. The latter was newly introduced to the definition of Zintl phases. Up to today, this work is cited more than 300 times. == Selected publications == * * == References == Category:German women chemists Category:German chemists Category:1942 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt faculty ",
