    "text": "Historians of mathematics have noted the involvement of prominent mathematicians in politics at various times and places, notably in Italy during the period of unification at the end of the nineteenth century. Those who become legislators attempt to use their mathematical skills to legitimise their political positions. However, some parliamentary colleagues tend to view them as failing to connect with the real world. A maths columnist for Forbes suggested in 2018 that mathematicians in politics would contribute strengths including problem-solving, creativity, overcoming challenges, and collaboration. John Derbyshire observed in 2003 that mathematicians have no dominant tendency; for example, Cauchy was a reactionary whereas Galois was a radical. He opines that the most advanced mathematicians do not give much thought to politics. == Notable mathematician-politicians == This is a list of people who at some points in their lives achieved notability both as academically-trained mathematicians (with a graduate degree, or published in mathematical journals) and also as elected politicians (at a state or national level). * Kazimierz Bartel (1882\u20131941), prime minister and senator in Poland * Muhammad Baydoun (1952\u2013), member of parliament and government minister in Lebanon * Vaclav Benda (1946\u20131999), member of the senate of the Czech Republic * Boris Berezovsky (1946\u20132013), member of the security council and parliament of Russia * Daniel Biss (1977\u2013), member of the Illinois Senate * \u00c9mile Borel (1871\u20131956), member of parliament and government minister in France * Francesco Brioschi (1824\u20131897), member of parliament in Italy * Rudranath Capildeo (1920\u20131970), member of parliament in Trinidad and Tobago * Lazare Carnot (1753\u20131823), member of parliament and government in France * Ahmed Chalabi (1944\u20132015), member of parliament and government in Iraq * Marquis de Condorcet (1743\u20131794), member of parliament in France * Luigi Cremona (1830\u20131903), member of senate and government minister in Italy * Ulisse Dini (1845\u20131918), member of parliament in Italy * Charles Dupin (1784\u20131873), government minister (briefly) and member of senate in France * Sergio Fajardo (1956\u2013), department governor in Colombia * Ute Finckh-Kr\u00e4mer (1956\u2013), member of parliament in Germany * Taj Haider * Daniel Hershkowitz * Eri Jabotinsky * Hermine Agavni Kalustyan * Alexander Lubotzky * Jerry McNerney * Michael Meister * Luigi Federico Menabrea * Keith Mitchell * Chike Obi * Kathleen Ollerenshaw * Paul Painlev\u00e9 * George Saitoti * Blagovest Sendov * Faustin- Archange Touad\u00e9ra * C\u00e9dric Villani ==References== Math Politicians ",
