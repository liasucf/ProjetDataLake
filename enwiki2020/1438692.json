    "text": "Nunsthorpe (sometimes known locally as 'The Nunny', or by its nickname of Garden City) is a suburb and housing estate in the western part of Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, England. It is situated between Laceby Road (A46) and Scartho Road (A1243), which respectively form its northern and eastern boundaries. The population is listed in the South ward of the North East Lincolnshire Unitary Council. There are over 2,400 homes on the estate, mostly former council properties now owned by the Lincolnshire Housing Partnership. There is a small area belonging to the Havelok/Northern Counties housing associations and a small area of private sector housing. There are a number of privately owned former council houses purchased under the Right to Buy scheme. The pre-Second World War development in the eastern part of the estate is known as Old Nunsthorpe while the post-war development is called New Nunsthorpe. To the west lies the Bradley Park Estate which contains around 430 dwellings, also mostly LHP properties. The combined population of Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park is approximately 8,000. To the north, on the other side of Laceby Road, is the Grange Estate and on the eastern boundary, in Scartho Road, was Grimsby Swimming Pool, which closed and was subsequently demolished.Scartho Baths closure: Council urges people to back new pool and not look to the past . This is Grimsby (1 March 2013). The Scartho Top private housing estate lies to the south. Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park are part of the Grimsby South ward of North East Lincolnshire unitary authority.North East Lincolnshire Council . Nelincs.gov.uk.

A quality mark was awarded after an independent assessment of improvement work undertaken on the estate by Shoreline and partners, Humberside Police and North East Lincolnshire Council, with the assistance of residents.'Award shows Nunsthorpe is great place to live'. This is Grimsby (10 February 2010). ==Origins== Although built in the 20th century, Nunsthorpe takes its name from the nuns who once inhabited the priory of Saint Leonard.House of Austin nuns \u2013 The priory of St Leonard, Grimsby | A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (pp. 179). British-history.ac.uk (22 June 2003). This stood at modern day Nuns Corner, where Scartho Road joins Laceby Road. \"Thorpe\" was an old word for hamlet or village. The priory was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539. In later years the land was occupied by Nuns Farm, until its demolition in 1935. In 1944 Grimsby College, now called The Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education, acquired the site. Situated at the southern edge of Grimsby (before the boundary extensions), for centuries the land where Nunsthorpe now stands was farmed using the open field system of agriculture. Lying mainly within the town of Grimsby it stretched westward from the priory, as far as the boundary with Bradley parish and southward, beyond the boundary with the parish of Scartho. Under enclosure awards of 1798 (in Scartho) and 1840 (in Grimsby), this land was acquired by successive Lords Yarborough. ==Old Nunsthorpe== Dame Kendal Grove Following the end of the First World War decent homes were needed for the returning servicemen. House building was started by Grimsby County Borough Council in 1920, on land bought from Lord Yarborough. Originally called the Laceby Road Site until 1923 the new Nunsthorpe housing estate, with its modern conveniences and large gardens was, as previously mentioned, also known as Garden City. Most of the streets in this early development, built during the 1920s and 1930s, were named after notable people \u2013 Burns, Byron, Kingsley, Leighton, Newton, Walton groves; Milton Road and Shelley Avenue. Dame Kendal Grove was named after a Grimsby- born actress while Sutcliffe Avenue was named after Jack Sutcliffe, a previous mayor of Grimsby. Saint Martin's Mission Church, a wooden building, was built during 1922 in Sutcliffe Avenue; this was replaced by a new church in 1937. There is still a structure on this site which is currently the base for Grimsby Judo Club. The first shops, including a post office, were built in Second Avenue during 1927\u201328 and a bus service (route 3) was introduced from Grimsby town centre to Nunsthorpe in 1928. In later years this service was extended to Cleethorpes. Also in 1928 the greater part of Scartho was absorbed by Grimsby, which brought the whole of the present Nunsthorpe area under the control of Grimsby council. At the same time part of Bradley parish was acquired on which the Bradley Park Estate would eventually be built. Nunsthorpe's population was further increased when, resulting from the Housing Act of 1930, slum clearance was carried out in the Grimsby town centre and the residents were moved to new houses on the estate. By 1939 around 700 houses had been built in Nunsthorpe. Nunsthorpe School was opened on Sutcliffe Avenue in 1931; previously children from the estate had been bussed to a school in another part of the town. It was two schools housed within one building, one for junior and one for senior pupils. By 1952 all the senior children had been transferred to a new school in Chelmsford Avenue. During the late 1920s a maternity hospital was established in Second Avenue using converted council houses. This was incorporated into a new building which opened in 1933. In 1943 a number of people were killed and houses were damaged when butterfly bombs were dropped on the estate during a German air raid on Grimsby. ==New Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park== The absorption of Scartho into Grimsby made available more land for house building. The pre-1928 boundary between Grimsby and Scartho ran past the Scartho Road Institution (now part of the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital) to what is the present-day rear gate of the hospital grounds at the end of Second Avenue, next to the resource centre. From there it continued westward through fields that would eventually become part of the New Nunsthorpe council housing development. It ran south of what is now Redbourne Road, crossed Winchester Avenue, ran to the north of Kirkstead Crescent, along Scawby Road until it reached Stainton Drive. The amalgamation made this boundary obsolete. In this post-Second World War New Nunsthorpe development the streets were mostly named after Lincolnshire villages, with the exception of Winchester Avenue and a few streets in an area of private housing, which were named after historic English towns. The development included the single-storey prefabricated buildings (prefabs), which were built in 1946 to help alleviate the housing shortage. In 1947 a large wooden hut was purchased and erected in Burwell Drive. This became the estate's earliest community centre, opened in 1949, at the same time the Nunsthorpe's first community association was formed. In 1951 saw the Nunsthorpe Nursery School opened, and in 1952 the branch library in Wootton Road was established. In 1963 the Viking Superstore, which had been converted from three smaller shops into one self-service supermarket, was opened in Second Avenue. Coronation Street stars Pat Phoenix and Philip Lowrie addressed an estimated crowd of 5,000 people in the open air before the official openingCoronation Street stars in store on estate. This is Grimsby (28 April 2012). During the late 1970s the Bradley Park Estate was built on land between Stainton Drive and the Bradley Recreation Ground. This land had once been part of Bradley parish. Some place names in Bradley Park, such as Bremerhaven Way, reflect Grimsby's links with its twin town, although Wymark View was named after the actor who was born in nearby Cleethorpes. Dolby Vale took its name from Sidney Vere Dolby, a long-serving radiologist at Grimsby General Hospital. The development also included Crosby School (now called Woodlands). ==Improvement schemes and resident consultation== Welcome to Nunsthorpe sign In 1992, for purposes of resident consultation, Grimsby borough council, then a district of Humberside County Council, divided the area into four neighbourhoods. Because of its size New Nunsthorpe was split into two neighbourhoods \u2013 Nunsthorpe Central and Nunsthorpe West, while Old Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park formed the remaining two. Each area had a steering committee. At that time discussions were taking place on the possibility of setting up a tenant management organisation in each neighbourhood. Independent housing consultants, Priority Estates Project, were brought in to canvass the views of residents but nothing developed from this idea. In 1994 the Department for the Environment approved multimillion-pound funding for Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park. This Estate Action scheme allowed for internal improvements to council houses and general improvements, such as better street lighting, the provision of off-road parking facilities and dropped kerbs for the convenience of wheelchair users. It also included the installation of traffic calming measures. All the prefabs of aluminium construction were renovated and are still in use. However, most of the prefabs containing asbestos were demolished between 1994 and 1997. Of the original 181 such prefabs only three owner- occupied ones now remain. Local housing association, Havelok and the Northern Counties housing association, were allocated part of the vacant prefab land for the construction of properties. Some of the land remained empty, part of it forming the open grassed area situated between Burwell Drive and Winchester Avenue. ===Consultative forum=== The Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Consultative Forum, established in 1992 to co-ordinate the neighbourhood steering groups, was reorganised and became directly elected by a postal ballot of residents at two yearly periods. The reconstituted forum held its inaugural meeting in 1995, with annual general meetings being held thereafter. In addition to the delegates elected from 13 areas (later reduced to six), ward councillors and council officers also attended meetings of the main committee and sub- committees. The forum was dissolved in 2004. The forum had three sub- committees, one being the Economic, Social and Cultural Development sub- committee (ESCD). Another sub-committee dealt with council tenant issues only, while the third concerned itself with wider estate action improvements, which affected tenants and homeowners. As circumstances changed, these sub- committees were gradually merged with the main committee. Representatives from local churches, schools, the police and other bodies were invited to attend ESCD meetings as observers. Along with various local agencies, the ESCD had delegates on the project team charged with establishing a resource centre on the estate. When the Sutcliffe Special School moved to a new site at Humberston, the empty building in Second Avenue was acquired from the local council at a nominal rent. Resident volunteers helped to clean and decorate the building, transforming it into the new Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Resource Centre. The project was funded initially from the Single Regeneration Budget, although the aim was for the centre eventually to become self- financing. Two residents associations, Bradley Park and Nunsthorpe Central, which existed between 1993 and 1999, sent voting delegates to the forum. These associations had replaced the steering committees for their respective neighbourhoods. They were also closely involved with the establishment of the resource centre. Previously operating from members' homes, when the centre opened in 1995 the associations were able to establish permanent headquarters there. Attempts to set up resident associations in Old Nunsthorpe and Nunsthorpe West were unsuccessful; however, from 1996 Old Nunsthorpe and Nunsthorpe Central residents began holding joint meetings. A Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Youth Association (now defunct) was established in 1996, supervised by the two adult associations. National Lottery funding enabled this organisation to employ a full-time youth worker based at the resource centre. During 1997, disillusionment among some residents on Bradley Park led to the brief formation of a second association there, in opposition to the existing resident group. Also in that year, some people, who were dissatisfied with the Nunsthorpe Central Association, established the short-lived Nunsthorpe South Association. ===Council housing stock transfer=== In 2004 tenants in North East Lincolnshire were balloted on whether the council housing stock should be transferred to a housing association. Transfer would release money that was unavailable to the council for improvements to properties. After a \"yes\" vote the remaining council houses on the two estates (around 1,600), together with the rest of the authority's housing stock, were transferred to the new locally based Shoreline Housing Partnership in March 2005. Shoreline tenants on the estates sent two delegates to the Boroughwide Tenant Assembly. One delegate represented Nunsthorpe East and Nunsthorpe Central while the other represented Nunsthorpe West and Bradley Park. The Assembly was later disbanded. Shoreline undertook a programme of investment in the transferred properties over a period of ten years and is currently in the process of implementing this programme. Planned home improvements include, where necessary, modern kitchens, bathrooms, central heating, decent roofs, security doors and windows, as well as smoke alarms. However, there are still parts of Nunsthorpe where it is difficult to attract tenants and houses remain boarded up. ==Former community organisations== Defunct community organisations include the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Residents and Tenants Association established in 2005, later changing its name to the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Trust. It opened a charity shop in Second Avenue, provided by the neighbouring Co-op shop at a nominal rent and staffed by volunteers from the estate. The shop closed in 2012, with the Trust blaming lack of support from funding organisations as the reason.Volunteers needed to continue couple's work on Grimsby's Nunsthorpe Estate. This is Grimsby (4 February 2012). During its time the premises hosted a single-parent club, photographic club, dancing and bingo. Money was raised to help fund the children's ward at the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, Nunsthorpe Community School, the Side Door Youth Club (based at Laceby Road Methodist Church), also the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Football Club. The Trust received a number of awards and commendations for its charity work.Nunsthorpe And Bradley Park Community Trust closes shop. This is Grimsby (24 April 2012). The Nunsthorpe Tenants and Residents Association was formed in 2006 and was involved in combating anti- social behaviour on the estate. It joined the campaign to restore the Nunsthorpe Recreation Ground following damage by vandals.PROTECTING the Nunsthorpe's new playground from vandals will be child's play \u2013 provided the community pulls together.. This is Grimsby (11 April 2011). Working with the Saint Martins Action Group (now Nunsthorpe Together) Nunsthorpe TARA provided a float for the 2006 Cleethorpes Carnival. During its existence the organisation arranged various outdoor activities for local children. It disbanded in 2013. The Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Partnership was an umbrella group that included the Nunsthorpe Community Centre, Nunsthorpe TARA, the Respect Funhouse and the Second Avenue Resource Centre. It entered three floats in the 2009 Cleethorpes Carnival, coming second in one section and joint first in another section. It is now part of the South Ward Partnership mentioned below.Float along and get on board!. This is Grimsby (29 April 2009). In 2003 a quarterly magazine called Livewire was introduced. Livewire gave news and views from around Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park. It incorporated the resource centre newsletter, Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Matters, which had been regularly distributed to houses in the area since 1995. The magazine relied on funding and this eventually came to an end. The last edition appeared in 2008. ==Current community organisations== Community groups currently operating on the estate include the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Association and Nunsthorpe Together. Other organisations include the Second Avenue Resource Centre (formerly the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Resource Centre), which opened in 1995. Its management board includes residents of the estate. The centre's services include the provisions of rooms for hire, sports facilities and computers for Internet access. Rented office space is also available. A number of organisations are based at the centre, including North East Lincolnshire Carelink, which operates a 24-hour monitoring system for vulnerable people. In 2006 the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park United Football Club, composed of young people, was formed with the support of Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Residents and Tenants Association. The Cabourne Road Tenants and Residents Association was formed in 2010. This association campaigns to eliminate anti-social behaviour in the street. It is trying to get measures introduced to prevent traffic speeding along the street and is also pushing for improvements to the road surface. South Ward Partnership, which includes Nunsthorpe, Bradley Park and the Grange Estate, is composed of residents and representatives from various agencies, working to improve conditions on the estates. Membership of the partnership is open to all residents of the ward aged 16 and over. Non-residents with an interest in the area may attend meetings without voting rights. It meets at various venues within the ward area.Closure threat to community forum. This is Grimsby (30 July 2011).

Activities include bingo and auctions. The centre was opened in 1985 by local snooker celebrity Ray Edmonds. The association existed from 1985 to 1994 and was re-established in 2004, following the dissolution of the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Forum. In 2007 the association received \u00a314,320 from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and Millennium Inorganic Chemicals. The money paid for alterations to the centre's ceiling, repairs to the heating system and the installation of safety glass in the doors and windows. In 2012 the centre was the scene of a disturbance involving local youths.Trapped and under siege as mob of 50 youths riot on Grimsby's Nunsthorpe estate . This is Grimsby (28 March 2012). Nunsthorpe Together was composed of representatives from the church, police and North East Lincolnshire Council. In 2008 it took over control of the Respect Funhouse from the Saint Martins Action Group. During its existence the Action Group staged local productions of Abbamania and Dancemania at the Grimsby Auditorium, both involving local children from North East Lincolnshire. Action Group members supported by a local police inspector and the Rector of Grimsby, appeared on the TV show Fortune: Million Pound Giveaway, appealing for funds to turn part of Saint Martin's church into a children's activity centre. The panel awarded them \u00a345,000, while a further \u00a3330,000 came from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. The project was officially opened in 2008. The Respect Funhouse had a Laser Quest arena, a multi-screen video jukebox and a maze of play areas \u2013 tunnels, slides, ball pools and climbing areas \u2013 also music rooms and quiet rooms where teenagers and children could do their homework. In 2008 young dancers from the Funhouse performed their fourth show, Musical Mania, at the Auditorium. The dancers stage regular events at the Beachcomber venue in Humberston.

During the 1995 summer holiday a fire, caused by a wiring fault, badly damaged some of the classrooms, making them unusable. Temporary mobile classrooms were brought in for the new term until the fire damage could be repaired. In 1999 the two schools amalgamated, undergoing another change of name to Woodlands Primary School. It was the first school in the country to introduce the five-term year.Correspondents | Five-term year might still be on. BBC News (30 June 1999). In 2011 Woodlands was North East Lincolnshire's winner in the regional stages of Dance Challenge. A group of children from the school travelled to London for the Dance Challenge UK finals. Dance Challenge is a national competition that challenges and rewards young dancers on any dance style. A number of sponsored events were held to fund travel and accommodation costs. Also in 2011 Woodlands submitted plans to demolish its current building and erect a new two-storey facility in its place. The new school will be a more compact environment than the current building and is expected to be open by the September term of 2012. Saint Mary's Catholic High School (established 1966) was located in Wootton Road. Saint Mary's agreed to merge with Matthew Humberstone Church of England School, Cleethorpes to form a new joint church school.
