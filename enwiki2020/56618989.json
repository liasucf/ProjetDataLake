She is described as a member of the Hiketabe clan (\u5f15\u7530\u90e8). In her youth, she was noticed by Emperor Y\u016bryaku by the Miwa River (\u4e09\u8f2a\u5dddMiwa-gawa) in Yamato Province. After this, she remained a virgin as she waited eighty years for the emperor to take her as a lover. According to the Kojikis account, as an old woman she met again with the emperor, and had a poetic exchange with him. These comprise four of the so-called shitsu-uta (\u5fd7\u90fd\u6b4c, also read shizu-uta). == References == == Cited works == * * == Further reading == * Hatakeyama 1987 * Itagaki 1984 Category:5th-century Japanese poets Category:Japanese women poets Category:5th-century Japanese women Category:5th-century Japanese people ",
