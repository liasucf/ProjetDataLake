    "text": "The Black Clover manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Y\u016bki Tabata. ==Main characters== ===Asta=== : is an orphan who was left under the care of a church during his infancy who has aspirations of becoming the next Wizard King. He possesses no magical power, but he overcame his weakness by increasing his physical strength, which allowed him to join the Magic Knight Squad known as the Black Bulls after acquiring a five-leaf clover grimoire where the Anti-Magic devil Liebe resides. The grimoire allows him to use Anti-Magic effectively due to his lack of mana, later honing his senses to predict an opponent's attack by sensing their ki. Asta originally used the magic-nullifying Demon-Slayer Sword and the magic-siphoning Demon-Dweller Sword he acquired at a dungeon, later acquiring the Demon-Destroyer Sword at the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout that allows him to destroy magic's actual effects, even after the spell has been cast. This allows him to exorcise the elf spirits, should he inflict enough damage to their host bodies using it. Asta later learns his weapons and grimoire once belonged to Elf Race's leader Licht, the book itself revealed to have demonic origins as its creation was engineered by the demon Zagred with another demon sealed within it. After the Witch Queen used her magic to increase the Anti- Magic flow in Asta's body, he gained the ability to transform into a form called \"Black Asta\" by tapping into the power of the demon within his grimoire. However, Asta later learns his power subjects him to a curse mark known as that makes him a target for the Magic Parliament, who see him as a monster that needs to be destroyed. At Julius' request, he later travels to Heart Kingdom, where he stays for six months to train and prepare for the fight against the Spade Kingdom. ===Yuno Grinberryall=== : is an orphan who turns out to be a prince from the Spade Kingdom, who was left under the care of a church during his infancy, acquiring a four-leaf clover grimoire and a member of the Golden Dawn. He uses Wind Magic and is the chosen partner of Sylph the Wind Spirit of the 4 great attributes. Sylph (nicknamed \"Bell\") often tries to play around with Yuno, but due to his serious demeanor, he is often found complaining. His serious attitude came about when Asta was injured defending him from bullies as a child. Yuno could only admire how Asta saved him, despite not having magic, and it made him feel ashamed. To make up for this, he trained himself to become Asta's equal in a moral sense. His \"cool\" demeanor is only broken when he is enjoying himself, usually when fighting someone strong or watching Asta prove his strength. He has proven himself to be a rising star among the ranks of Golden Dawn, capable of beating even the strongest mages with little to no effort. When he is physically changed into an Elf by Patry's ritual (the soul is hinted to be that of Licht's unborn son) Yuno's magical might and willpower allowed him to retain his mind as he faced Patry and the demon manipulating him. Yuno eventually rises to the rank of vice captain of the Golden Dawn. He is informed of his Spade Kingdom heritage, and immediately after, responds to Zenon's attack at the Golden Dawn base, but is easily defeated and left for dead. While he survives due to William's spell, he finds half the Golden Dawn dead, and is devastated at his failure to protect his friends. ===Noelle Silva=== : is a silver-haired member of the Black Bulls and the fourth-born child of the Clover Kingdom's royal family, House Silva. While incredibly powerful as a royal, possessing a vast amount of mana, Noelle initially had trouble controlling her Water Magic with her older brother Nozel acting resentful to her as his way of protecting her from both harm and the truth behind the death of their mother Acier. While Noelle used a wand as a means to cope with this magic, she learns that she has been unconsciously holding herself back out of fear of hurting anyone. Eventually, her training and the positive feedback from her new friends in the Black Bulls allow her to overcome that flaw, displaying her full potential when fighting the elf Kivn and gains the ability to create water-based armor that increases her offense and defense. Noelle, wanting to help Asta, would later learn the truth of her mother's death being caused by a devil named Megicula. She harbors strong romantic feelings for Asta, though she is reluctant to express it. ==Clover Kingdom== ===Wizard King=== ====Lumiere Silvamillion Clover==== : was a human prince from the first days of the Clover Kingdom who wanted to make life better for everyone in making Magic Tools and befriends Licht as both desired co-existence between their peoples. On the day of his sister's secret marriage to Licht, Lumiere was subdued by the Zagred-possessed prime minister after sending the manipulated royals to slaughter the elves and force Licht into becoming a Dark Elf to serve as a temporary vessel. Lumiere arrives in time as Licht begs Lumiere to kill him, after cursing his body so Zagred cannot use it. Lumiere is named the 1st Wizard King soon after. Severely injured after his battle with the monstrous Licht, Lumiere has Secre petrify him, so he can be revived by her should Zagred resurface. Once Zagred is defeated and the elf souls allowed to rest in peace, Lumiere joins them in the afterlife as the magic that kept him alive wears off, and is content that his ideals live on in the new generation. ====Julius Novachrono==== : is the 28th Wizard King and user of Time Magic, his obsession with new and strange forms of magic having him shirk from his duties on his free time. Julius was previously the Magic Knight Captain of the Aqua Deer Squad when they were previously the Grey Deer Squad; Yami and Vangeance both being members whom Julius personally recruited into the Magic Knights. Although he is killed by Patry to acquire the Magic Stones that he had Yami and the Black Bulls secure, he eventually revived himself through an ancient magic tool that he previously stored 13 years' worth of time in. This process revived Julius as a 13-year- old boy with his powers reduced, rendering him unable to carry out his duties as Wizard King. Despite this, he continues to work to support the Magic Knights, while keeping his age a secret from the public. ===House Kira=== One of the three royal houses alongside Houses Vermilion and Silva, 's lineage dates back to the foundation of the Clover Kingdom and genocide of the Elves. ====Augustus Kira Clover XIII==== : , the current King Clover and member of House Kira, is an arrogant and petty person who thinks that being noble is everything and has nothing but contempt for commoners. He is extremely envious that the people fail to acknowledge him when compared to the Wizard King. Augustus's need to be recognized motivated his decision to take credit for the Royal Knights which Julius actually devised. While extremely powerful as a member of royalty through his use of light magic, Augustus's overconfidence that his position alone made him superior to potential opponents convinced him to not hone his skills. Thus a majority of his spells are mostly showy displays of power meant to impress others, though they usually have the opposite effect and are easily dispatched. ====Damnatio Kira==== : is a member of House Kira who is chairman of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Parliament, a manipulative and ruthless man who places justice above even his own family. He is also a user of Scale Magic, making him able to shrink and counter all forms of magic save Anti-Magic. Following the elf incident, after dispatching anti- monarchist nobles who attempted to kill Augustus in the confusion, Damnatio oversees Asta's trial for using forbidden magic before the Black Bulls intervene with Julius passing a decree for a Black Bull mission outside the Clover Kingdom to hinder Damantio's inquisition. Damnatio allows this, but vows to place every Magic Knight through an inquisition should Asta's mission fails and threatens the Clover Kingdom in any way. ===Owen=== : is a Magic Knight and Julius's right hand who is the best healer in the Clover Kingdom, possessing Water Healing magic that allows him to reattach severed arms or emulate X-rays. After the fight in the Underwater Sea Temple, he tells Asta that he won't be able to use his arms, infected by the Ancient Curse magic, as his bones are turning to dust. After Patry completes the reincarnation ritual, Owen ends up being possessed by an Elf spirit with his magic inverted to destroy rather than heal. ===Black Bull Squad=== ====Yami Sukehiro==== : Nicknamed the , is the captain of the Black Bulls, who are regarded as the worst Magic Knight Squad due to unorthodox and unstable members, being both physically strong and intimidating to the point of giving death threats to anyone who annoys him. Despite this aggression, he serves as a mentor to the Black Bulls, wanting them to be as strong as possible. Yami originated from another country known as \"Land of the Rising Sun\" before ending up in the Clover Kingdom, joining the Magic Knights after meeting Julius Novachrono despite being looked down as a foreigner by his peers. Yami uses Dark Magic, using it to enchant his katana since his type of magic is regarded as Light Magic's polar opposite due to its slowness. His Dark Magic can also interfere with magic from the underworld, making him a valuable asset. He also possesses a sixth sense which allows him to sense his opponent's ki to predict their attack and counter, enabling him to learn of the connection between Patry and William. He is targeted by the Dark Triad for his Dark Magic, needed to create a Tree of Qliphoth. Though he and Asta manage to defeat Dante, he is captured and taken by Zenon, with his katana left in Asta's possession. A running gag involves him suffering from constipation and threatening anyone who disturbs him on the toilet, usually Asta or Finral. ====Finral Roulacase==== : is a member of the Black Bulls. He uses Spatial Magic primarily for transport, and is a womanizer and a coward, but has recently started becoming braver. For most of his life, he was considered by his father and stepmother as inferior to his younger brother, Langris Vaude, due to Finral not possessing offensive(Spatial) magic. Unable to handle the responsibility of becoming the head of House of Vaude, Finral leaves home and adopts Roulacase, his deceased mother's name, as his surname. This lack of responsibility led to his carefree and cowardly personality, and a fear of responsibility. Langris eventually becomes the Vice Captain of Golden Dawn,the squad deemed to the strongest, and looks down on Finral and the Black Bulls. Finral eventually starts helping out his comrades in combat as well, primarily using his power to trick their opponents and conduct surprise attacks, and his ability to manipulate and change the spatial location of his comrades as he wishes proves crucial in several of their battles against powerful opponents. Finral was gravely injured during the Royal Knight Selection Exam by Langris, and he was saved from being killed by the Black Bulls. Upon awakening, he aids Yami and Jack the Ripper during their battle against Latry, the elf possessing Langris, and manages to partially reconcile with him. Finral decides to accept responsibility and become the head of House Vaude, and works hard to overcome his womanizing urges to become a proper husband to Finnes Calmreich, the betrothed to the next head of House of Vaude. ====Magna Swing==== : is a member of the Black Bulls and is depicted as Yami's right-hand guy. Magna is a good-natured yet hot-headed delinquent who uses Fire Magic and rides his personalized broom, which he calls \"Crazy Cyclone\". Though his inherent-mana is low, he makes up for this weakness by launching several low-magic fireballs with varying effects. Magna was originally a commoner from Rayaka Village near the Clover Kingdom border, abusing his power in antagonizing the nearby village of Sosshi. He frequently fought against the village elder, sharpening his skills, before becoming his disciple, who influenced his choice to join the Magic Knights. He acts as a senior to Asta and Noelle, accompanying them on some of their missions. He and Luck are best friends and they have a competitive rivalry. He struggles to match Luck's strength, especially when Luck is accepted in the Royal Knights and he is not.The relationship between Magna and Luck proves key in freeing Luck from Rufel's possession, and they fight alongside the Black Bulls against the reincarnated elves. ====Luck Voltia==== : is a member of the Black Bulls, a borderline psychopath who uses Lightning Magic and is always smiling regardless of circumstances, giving him the nickname \"Luck the Cheery Berserker.\" He fights by creating gloves and boots to increase his speed and launch lightning balls. Born a commoner within Yvon Village and raised by a troubled woman before she died of stress, Luck was instilled with the notion that winning a fight is the same as being loved. This motivated him to fight stronger opponents to test his strength, joining the Magic Knights while gaining infamy from his conduct of nearly killing an opponent in the entrance exams. He and Magna are best friends and they have a good-natured rivalry. Later, during the raid of the Midnight Sun's base, Luck ends up being possessed by the elf spirit as a result of Patry's ritual. Luck is released from the spell after Rufel is defeated by Magna and Vanessa with Asta exorcizing the elf spirit while giving Rufel closure. ====Gauche Adlai==== : is a member of the Black Bulls who uses Mirror Magic, augmented by the small mirror in place of his left eye, that allows him to create mirror clones of himself or another. Gauche was originally a noble years prior when his parents died in an \"accident\" and then both he and his little sister Marie were robbed of their inheritance by another noble who cast them into the street. Gauche's devotion to Marie, which bordered on an unhealthy obsession that gave him a sister complex, motivated him to provide for her through criminal acts until he was arrested and Marie placed in an orphanage. Gauche was later recruited by Yami while attempting to escape prison and reach the orphanage. Though Gauche initially doesn't get along with the squad, even making attempts on Asta's life when Marie developed a crush on the youth, Gauche eventually starts to open up to the squad after seeing Asta's determination to work as a team. Following the Midnight Sun's attack on the Black Bulls' base, Gauche ends up being possessed by the Elf of the Apostles of Sephirah before Asta exorcises the elf spirit, and Drowa accepts the Black Bulls to be nothing like the barbarous humans who killed him and his sister Eclat long ago. Having spent the duration of the possession reconsidering his view on people, Gauche truly considers his teammates friends. ====Charmy Pappitson==== : is a member of the Black Bulls who eats constantly and often has food on her mind, being an adult despite her childlike appearance. While she uses Cotton Magic to usually create sheep that cook her meals, Charmy's magic has been seen to be extremely powerful as it has helped the squad out of more than one difficult situation, using a powerful binding spell, creating a giant sheep monster, and restoring people's magic, the only known spell that does so. During the battle against Lira, Charmy learns she is of Dwarf descent as she found herself able to assume a more adult-like appearance with her sheep turned into wolves to use with her mana-absorbing Food Magic. She develops a crush on Yuno after he saved her food during the attack on the capital. ====Vanessa Enoteca==== : is a very laidback pink-haired witch of the Black Bulls. During Vanessa's childhood, she is estranged from her mother, the Queen of the Witches, when she tried awaken Vanessa's ability to alter a person's destiny by keeping her in captivity for most of her life. After being freed by Yami, she joins the Black Bulls to forge her own path. Her Thread Magic grants her the ability to create threads too thin to be detectable to even magic, letting her manipulate people and objects on the battlefield. Eventually, when the Queen attempts to force Asta to kill Noelle, Vanessa awakens her fate-altering ability, the Red Thread of Fate, in the form of a cat familiar which she names Rouge; it is powerful enough to negate any outcome that Vanessa does not desire, such as the deaths of her teammates. This ability defends the Black Bulls from being harmed while Rouge is active. ====Grey==== : , true name unknown, is a member of the Black Bulls. Although initially depicted as a mysterious and massive shadowy man, Grey's true appearance is later revealed to be that of an extremely shy blue-haired girl, who uses her skilled Transformation Magic to temporarily assume the appearance of another person. Her magic also allows her to transform magic into other attributes, such as converting Sally's Gel Magic into crystals or vines. Grey was abused by her stepmother and twin stepsisters, who forced her to do every chore. She runs away from home when her stepsisters attack her after she transforms into them to try to be accepted. She is nearly robbed, but is saved by a runaway Gauche, who tells her not to run if she is not prepared to survive on her own. She develops a crush on Gauche when she meets him again in the Black Bulls, though he does not recognize her as she was transformed during their first meeting. She often spends time around him and Gordon, due to Gordon also having communication issues. ====Gordon Agrippa==== : is a member of the Black Bulls, who is very friendly and cherishes his comrades despite being misunderstood because of his pale and creepy appearance along with his whispering most of the time. An expert in Poison Magic, specifically curses, Gordon comes from a commoner family that specializes in curse magic that their ancestors used for murderous purposes. Because of this, he rarely interacted with anyone during his childhood, leading him to develop poor communication skills. He was further rejected during adulthood due to his Poison Magic, further increasing his desire for friends. He eventually starts speaking up more with his squamates, who accept him wholeheartedly. Gordon initially wanted nothing to do with his family since their legacy caused his childhood isolation, only to learn later that his father Nathan became a healer who uses their family's knowledge to locate and treat those who are cursed, which Gordon was unaware of due to his father being a poor communicator too. ====Zora Ideale==== : is a cynical and often disrespectful member of the Black Bulls who uses his versatile Ash Magic in creating various trap spells against his opponents, his most often used spell being one that rebounds an opponents spell at double the strength. He is harshly critical toward those he defeats. Zora's ideology developed as the result of the death of his father Zara, who looked up to Magic Knights and eventually joined the Purple Orcas as the first commoner Magic Knight. Zara was secretly killed by a teammate during a mission because of this. This disillusioned Zora, giving him a hatred of nobility and royalty, and made it his goal to put every corrupt Magic Knight in his place, refusing to wear his Magic Knight robe after Yami made him a member after defeating him in a battle. He infiltrates the Royal Knights Selection Exam under a false identity for his personal agenda, and constantly argues with Asta due to their drastically different personalities and worldviews. After witnessing his bravery, sense of justice and desire to work with others, Zora is inspired to work with others as well, and decides to officially declare himself as a Black Bull member. Though he still retains some of his arrogance and continues to argue with Asta, he joins the Royal Knights and fights alongside his squad against the Eye of the Midnight Sun. ====Henry Legolant==== : is the actual owner of the Black Bulls' base, using his Recombination Magic to remodel the building and rooms as he seems fit. Being bedridden due to an strange illness from birth, being born into a noble family, Henry prolongs his life with a magic absorbing constitution by passively siphoning mana from others. This forced his family to live in seclusion in the Common Region within the estate that would become the Black Bulls' base, the building itself stabilizing Henry's mana siphoning. When Henry's parents eventually left and never returned, Henry assumed that he would die soon until he was later found by Yami, and offered him ownership of upon his death. Yami refuses and instead tells Henry to survive as the base will soon be filled with many healthy and active people for him to siphon mana from. Since then, Henry expressed a sense of obligation to the Black Bulls. Though he speaks very slowly and does not reveal his existence to most of the Black Bulls for a long time, he secretly wanders the base to witness the camaraderie of the Black Bulls. Brief glimpses of Henry and the rearranging building lead to a rumor that a ghost haunts the Black Bulls' base. Asta often visited Henry in secret, as Henry's mana absorption does not affect him, due to Asta not having any mana. Revealing himself during the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack on the base, he proves key during the battle by configuring the base into a bull-shaped form, using the mana he accumulated from the Black Bulls to pilot the base and use powerful attacks. His sense of obligation motivated him to help the others battle Drowa, and an attempt to sacrifice himself to save them, but is rescued by his friends, and is glad he can fulfill his desire to openly live with them. ====Secre Swallowtail==== : is a young woman who lived five centuries ago in the Clover Kingdom as a servant of Wizard king Lumiere. She helped him perfect his magic tools with her Sealing Magic. Secre afflicted herself with the Weg curse after she sealed the demon Zagred away from the world of the living with the magic stones as a power source, causing her to grow horns as a drawback of this Forbidden Magic. This act altered the very nature her magic, and she gained the ability to transform into the form of an anti-bird after sealing the Prince as a stone, as a fail- safe measure, should Zagred return once again. Secre remained in her bird form for centuries before deciding to stay near Asta after encountering him during his Magic Knights Entrance Exam. She continued to be with Asta even after he was included as a member in the Black Bulls. Upon seeing her, the other Black Bull members named her . While she was with the Black Bulls as their pet bird, she played a key role in gathering a majority of magic stones for them. When Zagred returned after 5 centuries, Secre borrows Finral to reach Lumiere so she can use the magic stones to revive him while returning to her true form before they could join Asta and others at the Shadow Palace. She proves to be crucial when she unseals Licht's soul and seals away Asta's physical damage, allowing him to draw even more power, which proved necessary to destroy Zagred. While Secre wanted to remain by Lumiere's side as he passes on, he convinces her to remain with the Black Bulls as an official member. When Secre and Asta are convicted by the Magic Parliament for their involvement with devils, Yami interrupts and proclaims amidst everyone that Secre too was a member of the Black Bulls, and warns everyone to not lay a finger on her, along with Asta. This motivates her to join the Black Bulls, and she supports the other Black Bull members in their mission to investigate devils. ====Nacht==== is the enigmatic vice-captain of the Black Bulls, who uses Shadow Magic to manipulate shadows. He is able to slip in and out of any shadows, immobilize people who step into shadows, and physically restrain people with shadows. He is contracted to four devils with various animal masks, hosting one of them, . Pragmatic, logical, and blunt, Nacht dislikes most of the Magic Knights, and freely admits to hating the Black Bulls, but works with them to stop the Dark Triad anyway, as he absolutely loathes their meaningless evil. An associate of Yami's when they were part of the Gray Deer squad, Nacht was arbitrarily named vice-captain, with only Yami and Julius aware of his position. Nacht infiltrates the Spade Kingdom, undergoing a highly secret undercover mission. When he returns to the Clover Kingdom after the Dark Triad's attacks, he introduces himself and Gimodelo to Asta, and decides to teach him how to use a devil's power.

Born as an illegitimate child to an unknown noble, Vangeance suffered a horrific abusive childhood before and after being accepted as an aristocrat. He formed a deep friendship with Patry, who reincarnated into his body, as William's desire to care for the soul inside him gave him a reason to live through his childhood. Julius served as a mentor and friend to William, even making the mask that William wears which he made special for him to conceal the scar he was born with. As Yami had suspicions of them prior due to William and Patry's similarities, William is ultimately suppressed when Patry takes complete control of his host's body through the completed reincarnation ritual. William eventually regains his body when Asta exorcizes Patry at the elf's request so his magic can help Licht calm the other reincarnated elves and allow them to move on the afterlife, allowing him to resume his duties as a Magic Knight after Julius forgives him for his role in Patry's actions. William is later abducted by Zenon Zogratis for the Dark Triad's aim of creating a Tree of Qliphoth. ====Langris Vaude==== : is the Golden Dawn's vice-captain and Finral's younger brother, having replaced him as their family's heir due to possessing stronger and more offensive Spatial Magic compared to Finral. This made Langris develop an arrogant attitude towards his brother. However, Langris secretly envies his brother's good-natured personality, noticing people prefer Finral's company to his. Langris feels he must be better than Finral in every aspect, or else he is worthless. Langris ends up being possessed by the spirit of Patry's cousin after Patry completes the ritual to resurrect the elves. Latry storming the palace to take Augustus Kira Clover XIII hostage while subjecting him to torture before Yami, Finral, and Jack arrive to stop the elf.

This leads to her kindly and gentle personality, though she can be blunt and rude to people she hates. She also falls deeply in love with Asta, after seeing him fight against all odds despite having no magic. ====Alecdora Sandler==== : is a nobleman and member of the Golden Dawn who uses Sand Magic. He is mostly stoic in nature, having completely devoted himself to William since being saved during a mission and believing that only he can fulfill his captain's dream of becoming Wizard King. This placed him at odds with Yuno whom he considered unworthy of William's favor, and utterly loathes him for wanting to become the next Wizard King. This eventually came to a head during the Royal Knights Selection Exam when Sandler and Yuno battled on opposing teams, with Sandler losing in a one-on-one battle with Yuno. ====Hamon Caseus==== : Hamon Caseus was a nobleman and a 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom's Golden Dawn and Royal Knights squads.

She looks after Marie Adlai, Gauche Adlai's younger sister, and prevents him from seeing Marie more than once a month due to his obsessive behaviour. She participates in the fight to rescue the children of Nean Village from Baro and Neige, proving that she is still a force to be reckoned with despite her advanced age. After she is injured in the fighting Gauche starts treating her with more respect. After she recovers she resumes her duties caring for her orphans. === Marie Adlai === : is Gauche's little sister whom he adored enough to become a criminal for after they were kicked out of their family estate to provide for her. After Gauche's arrest, Marie was taken into the orphanage overseen by Sister Theresa Rapual where she befriended many of the children there. When Patry reincarnates the elves, Marie is possessed by the elf who possesses Eye Magic that allows her to use spells without need of a grimoire. Marie returns to normal after Asta exorcises the elf spirit from her body. === Neige === : is a rogue mage and younger brother of Baro who can use Snow Magic, helping Baro kidnap children out of fear of making him angry. Neige's other reason is his obsessive desire for friends, lashing out at Marie when she denounces kidnapping as a way of befriending others. During the battle against the Magic Knights when they go to rescue the children, Neige is saved from Baro's mud monster form by Asta so he can take responsibility for his crimes. Neige saves Asta by freezing Baro solid and vowing revenge on Sally and the Eye of the Midnight Sun for making Baro a monster. After Asta says he would happily be his friend as he allows himself to be arrested, his repentant mindset is noted as he is sentenced to community service at Sister Theresa's church. === Baro === : is a dark-haired mage who possesses Mud Magic and spectacles to measure a person's mana. A low-level thug hired by Sally to collect mana by stealing it from children. During his attempt to drain mana from the children of Nean Village, which included the siblings of Rebecca Scarlet and Gauche Adlai's sister, he requested Sally's help after being defeated and tied up. While Baro intended to quickly flee the moment he is freed, he ends up being subjected to Sally's Reverse Magic Tool which causes him to be consumed by his magic and turned into a giant monster. He is defeated by Asta, Gauche and Sister Theresa with his remains frozen solid by Neige. === Fanzell Kruger === : is a 28\u2013year old Wind Magic user, swordsman and a former commander of the Diamond Kingdom's army. He led his fianc\u00e9 Dominante and several of his students to desert the Diamond Kingdom after growing tired of the army's cruelty, getting separated from Dominante and assuming the worst. But after Fanzell trained Asta in swordsmanship after the youth got his grimoire, he eventually reunites with Dominante and the two keep a quiet profile in the Clover Kingdom. He helps Asta during the Forest of Witches incident, reuniting with Mars and Fana as he takes the latter under his protection. === Dominante Code === : , originally from the Forest of Witches, formerly served the Diamond Kingdom. Her fianc\u00e9 Fanzell mentioned her exceptional skill at crafting magical tools such as wands, flying broomsticks, and even invisibility cloaks. Dominante deserted the Diamond Kingdom alongside Fanzell as they fled into the Clover Kingdom. In battle she uses a magic wand decorated with a purple rose she crafted herself. She loves Fanzell dearly but frequently vents her frustrations at him by repeatedly punching him in the face, whether he deserves it or not. === Mariella === : is an Ice Magic user and former student of Fanzell who is a ruthless assassin, having feigned deserting the Diamond Kingdom to retrieve Fanzell and assassinate any other deserters. When she meets Asta she admits that she is also wary of the Diamond Kingdom, becoming an official deserter when she helps the Black Bulls defeat her fellow assassins, and later lives with Fanzell and Dominante to atone for her past crimes by helping others. === Licht === : The elder of the Elves who possesses Sword Magic, is the previous owner of the Five-Leaf Clover Grimoire currently possessed by Asta. Licht expressed a desire for his people to co-exist with humans and befriended Lumiere while falling in love with the human's sister Tetia. After Licht and Tetia conceived a half-elf child, they married with the elves present. Tetia's family and the human royals attacked while Licht watched his wife and people get slaughtered. After his Grimoire transformed into a five-leaf clover grimoire, Licht struggles to keep the demon from possessing him before using the magic stones to turn himself into a mindless monster to prevent his possession. Lumiere is then forced to kill his friend to stop his rampage after extracting the elf's mana. Licht was reduced to a skeleton littering the area Hage Village would be built on, while being demonized by the Clover Kingdom's stories of the event. While Patry assumed Licht's identity after reincarnating into the body of William Vangeance five centuries later, he has Sally create an artificial body for Licht's soul to inhabit once all the Elves have been fully revived. Though he is revived, the effects of his monstrous transformation render his soul mostly asleep, his actions driven only by instinct. While indifferent to Asta possessing his grimoire and swords, Licht takes back the Demon-Dweller Sword and accompanies Rhya to Clover Castle where he proceeds to fight Zagred with Yami and Charla. Later, a restored Secre unseals his soul, and he reverts to his true personality and regains his true strength, fighting alongside his friend, the also revived Lumiere. Once Zagred is defeated and the elf souls are allowed to pass on, Licht decides to join his people in the afterlife while his artificial body is used by Rades to keep Patry among the living. ==References== Black Clover ",
