He regularly appears on ABC local radio and Radio National shows and at writers\u2019 festivals. He was head of the Honours programme for creative writing at the University of Melbourne before becoming the first recipient of the Dr Bruce McGuinness Indigenous Research Fellowship at Victoria University in Melbourne in June 2015. In 2017 he became the first Indigenous writer to win the Patrick White Award. ==Heritage and early life== Birch's maternal great-grandfather was an Afghani from the Punjab, who migrated to Australia in 1890, who had to get exemption from the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 to take his wife home to meet the family. He also has Barbadian convict (James \"Prince\" Moodie, transported to Tasmania for 14 years for \"disobedience\") and Indigenous heritage. He grew up around Fitzroy, a working-class suburb of Melbourne considered a slum. After being expelled for the second time, he left school aged 15 and became a telegram boy on a bicycle. ==Career== After spending a decade as a firefighter, Birch attended Melbourne university as a mature student when he was 30 years old. In 2003 he was awarded the Chancellor's Medal for the best PhD in Arts. Birch has appeared on ABC radio on shows such as Conversations with Richard Fidler, Life Matters and RN Afternoons. He became the first recipient of the Dr Bruce McGuinness Indigenous Research Fellowship at Victoria University in Melbourne in June 2015 and is still a research fellow there. His work involves academic research, creative writing projects, student mentoring, lecturing and community engagement. ==Activism== Birch is politically active in the climate change and Indigenous title movements. In his novels, he has incorporated themes affecting Indigenous people, such as colonial oppression, dispossession, the Stolen Generations and generational violence, but weaves them creatively into the stories. He donates a portion of any prize money to the Indigenous youth organisation dedicated to climate justice, Seed. == Bibliography == ===Novels=== * Blood (2011) * Ghost River (2015) * Shadowboxing Scribe Publications Pty Limited, 2006, ; Scribe Publications, 2010, * The White Girl University of Queensland Press, (2019) ===Short story collections=== * Father's Day Hunter Publishers, 2009, * The Promise : Stories University of Queensland Press, 2014, * Common People, 2017 == Awards and honours== * Shadowboxing 2006 shortlisted Queensland Premier's Literary Awards \u2014 Arts Queensland Steele Rudd Australian Short Story Award * Shadowboxing 2011 Commended, Kate Challis RAKA Award * Blood 2012 shortlisted Miles Franklin Literary Award * Blood 2012 finalist Melbourne Prize \u2014 Best Writing Award * Blood 2012 winner Melbourne Prize \u2014 Civic Choice Award * Blood 2011 highly commended The Fellowship of Australian Writers Victoria Inc.
