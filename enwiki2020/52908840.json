    "text": "Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga () is a Pakistani current affairs and political talk show, hosted by Aamir Liaquat on Bol News. The show covers top stories and current affairs in Pakistan. It airs every Monday to Friday at prime time from 10:00pm to 11:00pm PST, with repeat telecasts at 01:00am the following day. The show has been hosted by Aamir Liaquat since its establishment, until his resignation from the channel in November 2017. It was thereafter hosted by a character known as Mr. Qaum, who wears a V mask and directly addresses the audience. In April 2018, Liaquat re-joined the channel and continued his transmissions of the show. In 2019, Aamir Liaquat again left the channel and joined the Geo network. Liaquat has called out and prominently criticized several Pakistani liberal and leftist personalities on his show for their political and ideological views. One such focus of attention was Tarek Fatah, one of the staunchest critics of Pakistan. The two were later involved in a Twitter feud.. He resigned from BOL News during his live show Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga. ==Controversies== On 26 January 2017, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) ordered a suspension of Liaquat's show over \"hate speech\". The media watchdog's notification stated that Liaquat had aired during his show, from 2 January to 24 January, allegations comprising derogatory remarks, incitement to violence, casting of aspersions, and accusations of anti-state or anti-religious activities against various individuals. The suspension came after Liaquat had lashed out at some civil society activists on his show for blaming the country's intelligence agencies over the disappearance of five online bloggers, who were accused of hosting blasphemous posts or content critical of the military on their pages. However, the Sindh High Court granted a stay order against PEMRA's decision and allowed Liaquat to continue his broadcasts until a verdict was issued on the matter. The Supreme Court then directed Bol to cease airing the show or face contempt of court charges, and Bol agreed to follow the court's order. Later, the Islamabad High Court overturned PEMRA's ban, allowing the show to continue its transmission on 28 February. Amnesty International criticised the Pakistani government over its purported inaction, terming the show's content a \"smear campaign\" against human rights and civil society activists. During the suspension, the show was renamed to \"Qaum Kay Saath Aisay Nahi Chalay Ga\". It featured a dummy cartoon disguised in a Fawkes mask who talked to the audience in a robotic voice-over. The show was reverted to its original name and format when Aamir Liaquat was reinstated as host. However, following Liaquat's resignation from the channel in November 2017, the character was reinstated under the name \"Mr. Qaum\". By April 2018, Aamir Liaquat re-joined the show as its host after he returned to Bol News. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 Pakistani television series debuts Category:BOL Network Category:Conservatism in Pakistan Category:Current affairs shows Category:Pakistani television talk shows Category:Television shows set in Karachi Category:Urdu-language television shows ",
