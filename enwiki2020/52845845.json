    "text": "The 1928 United States presidential election in Utah took place on November 6, 1928 as part of the 1928 United States presidential election. All contemporary forty-eight states took part, and state voters selected four voters to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Utah voted for Republican nominee Herbert Hoover, formerly Secretary of Commerce, over the Democratic nominee, four-time New York governor Al Smith. Mormon Utah was much less affected by anti-Catholic passion against Smith and his faith than either the Protestant Upper South or the secular Pacific Northwest: indeed the LDS hierarchy endorsed Smith when he won the Democratic nomination.Archer, J. Clark and Taylor, Peter J.; Section and Party: A Political Geography of American Presidential Elections, from Andrew Jackson to Ronald Reagan p. 173 In fact, in the days before the election it was thought by pollsters that Smith would carry the state,Clapper, Raymond; 'Hoover Deluge Sweep Higher: May Pass Mark Set by Harding; Smith Gets Greatest Popular Vote Ever Given Democrat but Makes Poor Showing on Electoral'; The Pittsburgh Press, November 7, 1928, p. 1 although neither Cox nor Davis nor La Follette had won a single county during the previous two elections. However, late swings gave the state to Hoover by a margin whose size increased in late counting. Nonetheless, the LDS endorsement did cause Utah to prove Smith's eleventh-strongest state \u2013 and his strongest outside the urban Northeast or the \"Solid South\" \u2013 voting 9.70 percent more Democratic than the nation at-large.Counting the Votes; Utah Smith divided the sizable 1924 La Follette vote with Hoover, and carried the ethnically diverse mining-based Carbon County by fourteen, and also won a five-point majority in Juab County in the state's west for the first Republican losses in any Utah county since 1916 when anti-war sentiment shifted the state to Woodrow Wilson.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 47 ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! colspan=\"6\" | 1928 United States presidential election in Utah |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes |- ! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican | Herbert Hoover | align=\"right\" | 94,618 | align=\"right\" | 53.58% | align=\"right\" | 4 |- ! style=\"background- color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic | Alfred E.
