    "text": "The 2017 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the provincial women's curling championship of Manitoba, was held from January 25 to 29 at the Eric Coy Arena in Winnipeg. The winning Michelle Englot team represented Manitoba at the 2017 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in St. Catharines, Ontario, finishing second. The event was most notable for the defeat of the defending Olympic champion Jennifer Jones rink in the semifinal.http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Curling/2017/01/29/22700475.html Jones lost to Darcy Robertson who proceeded to lose to the Michelle Englot rink in the final. Englot, who is a resident of Regina, Saskatchewan had won seven provincial titles in her home province, but joined her new Winnipeg-based team in the 2016 off season, replacing their previous skip Kristy McDonald who had lost in the final of the 2016 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts. It was the first provincial title for Englot's third, Kate Cameron, while second Leslie Wilson-Westcott and lead Raunora Westcott won their third provincial titles.http://www.winnipegsun.com/2017/01/29/saskatchewan-import-englot-wins- manitoba-scotties Jennifer Jones' loss in the semifinal would mark the first time since 2004 that she would not win a provincial tournament she had participated in.http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/jennifer- jones-knocked-out-of-manitoba-scotties-for-the-first-time- since-2004-412089233.html Jones cited a number of factors for her team's loss stating \"the ice was tricky today ... draw shots were harder and it was a struggle with draw weight for everybody\".http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Curling/2017/01/29/22700475.html Jones' semifinal loss was her second in a row, after having won all seven of her round robin games.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-scotties- jones-1.3957417 After the event, Jones was awarded as the tournament's all- star skip, Cameron was named all-star third, Vanessa Foster (Team Robertson) was named all-star second and Mariah Mondor (Team Birchard) was named all-star lead.http://mytoba.ca/featured/manitoba-scotties-2017-awards/ ==Teams== The defending Olympic champion Jennifer Jones rink was the top seed ahead of the event. They had not played in the 2016 provincial Scotties, as they had an automatic berth to the 2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada for having won the 2015 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. 2016 provincial champion Kerri Einarson was given the second seed, while eventual-winner Michelle Englot was given the third seed.http://globalnews.ca/news/3193075/team- jennifer-jones-unveiled-as-the-top-seed-for-the-manitoba-scotties/ The teams are listed as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
