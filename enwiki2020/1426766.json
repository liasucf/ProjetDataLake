    "text": "Difluoromethane, also called HFC-32 or R-32, is an organic compound of the dihalogenoalkane variety. It has the formula of CH2F2. It is a colourless non- toxic gasname=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_Difluoromethane|CH2F2. == Uses == Atmospheric concentration of difluoromethane at various latitudes since year 2009. Difluoromethane is a molecule used as refrigerant that has excellent heat transfer and pressure drop performance, both in condensation and vaporisation. It has a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 675 times that of carbon dioxide, and an atmospheric lifetime of nearly 5 years.May 2010 TEAP XXI/9 Task Force Report It is classified as A2L - slightly flammable by ASHRAE,2009 ASHRAE Handbook and has zero ozone depletion potential (ODP). Difluoromethane is thus a relatively low-risk choice among HFC refrigerants, most of which have higher GWP and longer persistence when leaks occur. Difluoromethane in a zeotropic (50/50 mass%) mixture with pentafluoroethane (R-125) is known as R-410A, a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons (aka Freon) in new refrigerant systems, especially for air-conditioning. The zeotropic mix of difluoromethane with pentafluoroethane (R-125) and tetrafluoroethane (R-134a) is known as R-407A through R-407F depending on the composition. Likewise, R-504 is the azeotropic (48.2/51.8 mass%) mixture with chlorotrifluoromethane (R13). Difluoromethane is currently used in residential and commercial air-conditioners in Japan, China, and India as a substitute for R-410A. In order to reduce the residual risk associated with its mild flammability, this molecule should be applied in heat transfer equipment with low refrigerant charge such as brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHE), or shell and tube heat exchangers and tube and plate heat exchangers with tube of small diameter. Many applications confirmed that difluoromethane exhibits heat transfer coefficients higher than those of R-410A under the same operating conditions but also higher frictional pressure drops. == References == == External links == * Flammability Measurements of Difluoromethane in Air at 100 \u00b0C * Difluoromethane at Gas Encyclopaedia * IR absorption spectra Category:Fluoroalkanes Category:Halomethanes Category:Refrigerants ",
