The bank initially provided a $560 million construction loan on the mall. Kommersant reported that, as part of a restructuring, Aviapark Mall Holdings received an option to buy the remaining stake from Gazprombank, which it exercised, removing the bank from the ownership structure. It received its GPZU, or approved development plan, in June 2012 and began construction later that year. The opening was projected for the fourth quarter of 2014. Jones Lang LaSalle was named as the property\u2019s leasing agent. ==Major Retailers== The mall\u2019s anchors include French retailer Auchan, the home improvement chain OBI, IKEA, Stockmann, Sephora and H&M.; Karo, a Russian theater chain, operates a 17-screen cinema, one of the largest in Russia. == Gallery == File:AviaPark Moscow 01-2016 img3.jpg|Aquarium in the shopping mall.
