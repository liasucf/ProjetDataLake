    "text": "A\u00f1asco (), named after one of its settlers, Don Luis de A\u00f1asco, is a municipality of Puerto Rico located on the west coast of the island bordering the Mona Passage to the west, north of Mayag\u00fcez, and Las Marias; south of Rinc\u00f3n, Aguada, and Moca and west of San Sebasti\u00e1n and Las Marias. It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== The town was founded on October 18, 1733 and named after Don Luis de A\u00f1asco, a colonist from the Extremadura region of Spain who came to Puerto Rico with Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. A\u00f1asco was founded by the initiative of rich landowner Don Jos\u00e9 de Santiago, who wanted to establish the villa in properties owned by Don Luis de A\u00f1asco. The property was located on the margins of the r\u00edo Guaorabo, as the Ta\u00ednos called it. A\u00f1asco town was preceded by the first settlement of San Germ\u00e1n. In November 1511, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n handed over governorship to Juan Cer\u00f3n, a lieutenant of the viceroy Diego Colon (son of Cristobal Colon or Cristopher Columbus). Cer\u00f3n ordered Miguel de Toro, a lieutenant of Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, to create a \"Christian Village\" in western Borinquen, calling it San Germ\u00e1n. This was the second attempt of foundation given in 1511 at the mouth of the Guaorabo River (present day Rio A\u00f1asco), near the area known today as A\u00f1asco, Puerto Rico. This first settlement was attacked in 1528, 1538, and again in 1554. A fort to protect this town began in 1540, but its construction was suspended in 1546 when the people decided to move inland being tired of attacks. Attacks by Carib Indians forced the population to move south inland to the present site of the present town of San Germ\u00e1n. In the 18th century, A\u00f1asco was the fourth most populous municipality in Puerto Rico, after San Germ\u00e1n, San Juan, and others. The A\u00f1asco River is also claimed to be the site of the popular legend of the drowning of the Spaniard Diego Salcedo in 1511 at the hands of the Ta\u00ednos, proving the Spanish soldiers were not gods and igniting a revolt. It is believed that the revolt was led by the cacique Chayo\u00e1n and suppressed by Spanish soldiers. Many of the first settlers to the area came from the Canary Islands and the south of Spain. The 1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake destroyed A\u00f1asco's parish church, the town hall and other buildings, almost eliminating most of the historic downtown structures. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in A\u00f1asco.
