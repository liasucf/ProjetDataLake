    "text": "Imperial Valley Geothermal Project, also known as the Salton Sea Geothermal Field, is a complex of eleven geothermal power stations located along the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea in the Imperial Valley of California. It is the second largest geothermal field in the United States after The Geysers in Northern California. ==Description== Imperial Valley lies atop a region of high geothermal energy with an estimated 2,950 MW of geothermal potential. Of that total, 2250 MW are currently developable, while the remaining 700 MW would become available as the lake shrinks in size. About 403 MW is generated by the existing power plants, ten of which are owned by CalEnergy and one by EnergySource. ===Hell\u2019s Kitchen Geothermal Project=== In 2016, the Australian firm Controlled Thermal Resources announced plans to build a 140 MW geothermal power plant and a lithium extraction facility capable of producing 15,000 tons (13,600 tonnes) by 2023 and 75,000 tons (68,000 tonnes) by 2027. The company hopes to create a major new domestic source of the mineral, which is a key ingredient used in batteries for electric cars and energy storage. The project is expected to be operational by 2023. ==Geothermal power stations== This is a table of all constituent geothermal power stations. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" |- ! Name !
