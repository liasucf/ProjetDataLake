    "text": "The 500 Festival Open Invitation was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, played during the 1960s in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was sponsored by The 500 Festival, a not-for-profit volunteer organization created in 1957 to organize civic events to promote the Indianapolis 500. The tournament was played at the Speedway Golf Course, located in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex; the exception was in 1965, when it was played at Greentree Country Club while the Speedway was undergoing renovations. ==Tournament highlights== In 1961 Doug Ford won on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff over Arnold Palmer. In 1963 the Indianapolis 500 was held on Thursday May 30, and the tournament was held over four days from Friday, May 31 to Monday, June 3. Previously the golf tournament was held prior to the running of the race. The one-day turnaround required grounds crews to quickly clean up the nine holes inside the track, used on race day for parking by fans. Considerable attention was given to the fact that several top names on the PGA Tour decided to skip the event.Speedway Golf Sponsors Angry Among the reasons cited was the low purse, and the overall unchallenging nature of the course. In 1964 the tournament was held from Wednesday, May 27 through Friday, May 29, then concluded Sunday May 31. The Indianapolis 500 was held Saturday May 30. Gary Player sank a birdie putt on the final hole to clinch the victory. The 1965 tournament was held at Greentree Country Club. The Speedway Golf Course was undergoing a renovation project. In 1966 the tournament was moved out of the month of May and away from the activities directly surrounding the Indy 500. Billy Casper won the event three times while Doug Ford won it twice. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" !Year!!Dates!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up!!Winner's share ($)!!Ref |- |1968 || Jun 6\u20139 || Billy Casper (3) || || 70-71-69-70=280 || align=center|\u22128 || 1 stroke || Frank Beard Mike Hill || align=right|20,000 || Casper nips Hill for fourth win |- |1967 || Jul 6\u20139 || Frank Beard || || 70-71-69-69=279 || align=center|\u22129 || 3 strokes || Rod Funseth Rives McBee || align=right|20,000 || Beard Wins Speedway |- |1966 || Jul 28\u201331 || Billy Casper (2) || || 69-70-68-70=277 || align=center|\u221211 || 3 strokes || R.
