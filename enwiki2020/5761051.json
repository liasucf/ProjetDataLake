    "text": "Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) is a term for software and hardware government products that are ready to use and which were created and are owned by a government agency. Typically GOTS are developed by the technical staff of the government agency for which it is created. It is sometimes developed by an external entity, but with funding and specification from the agency. Because agencies can directly control all aspects of GOTS products, these are sometimes preferred for government purposes. GOTS software solutions can normally be shared among government agencies without additional cost. GOTS hardware solutions are typically provided at cost (i.e., R&D; costs not recouped). ==List of GOTS software== * Interactive Scenario Builder * Naval Simulation System (NSS) * Personal Computer Debriefing System (PCDS) * SIMDIS * TractorFax (TFT) * Ghidra * VistA ==See also== * Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Category:Government software ",
