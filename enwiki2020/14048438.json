The Latin lyrics were written by the Rector, Dr. John Marshall, in 1895, and set to music by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, a former pupil of the school.John Murray, A History of the Royal High School. Edinburgh, Royal High School, 1997, p. 65. James Trotter comments on Marshall's character and influence: 'The spirit which inspired him is well exhibited in his \"Song of the High School.\"'James J. Trotter, The Royal High School, Edinburgh. London, Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, 1911, p. 70. The first two verses are sung with the refrain at the end of the annual school session, on the Commemoration and Prize Giving Day each July. The third line, 'sicut arx in colle sita' ('like a citadel placed on a hill': this is the literal meaning, not the one that Marshall used in his English translation) refers both to the situation of the school building on the slopes of Calton Hill and to the school crest, which shows a turreted castle on a rock. The school song, along with the centenary hymn, Nisi Dominus Frustra (words by J.C. Stewart, music by Charles H. F. O'Brien), is one of two well- known musical compositions the school has produced.'Royal High School: Nisi Dominus Frustra and Schola Regia ' (Edinburgh: Bruce Clements, 1925), pp. 6-7, in Sacred Music (British Museum, 5 August 1925). British Library, E.1498.t.(46.). It has been learnt by generations of Royal High Scholars, and the cultural historian John Bruce Barclay relates a well-known anecdote that testifies to its general currency: 'During the darkest period of the Second World War a watch on board a ship in a middle-east harbour was pacing the deck when he suddenly heard in the darkness the watch on another ship whistling a tune. It was familiar. It was the School song. The solo became a duet but neither man saw the other.'J. B. Barclay, The Tounis Scule: The Royal High School of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, The Royal High School Club, 1974, p. 78. SCHOLAE REGIAE EDINENSIS CARMENTrotter, Royal High School, pp. 135-7. Vivas, Schola Edinensis, Schola Regia venerabilis! Sicut arx in colle sita, Sicut sol e nubibus densis, Splendes, splendeas in aeternum, Alma Mater atque amabilis: Refrain Vivas Schola Regia, Vivas Schola Regia, Vivas, vivas, Schola Regia! Schola Regia! Quo in aevo tu vetusto Inter parva infans parvula Faustis tamen omnium votis Domicilio in angusto Cursum tuum ad honores Iniisti vaga, tremula - Refrain Tumgavisa est Doctrina Gaudent Leges, gaudent Artes; Matar enim tu bonorum Surgis altera Erycina Inter gratias atque Amoris Splendidas actura partes. Refrain Vivas, atque in annoscrescas, Alma Mater, Schola amata! Omnium particeps honorum Surgas semper, neu compescas Studium tuum gloriae sacrum; Fausta sis, felix, beata! Refrain Liberi tui te laudamus Laeto omnium cum clamore, Et quum multis posthac annis Tui quam juvenes amabamus, Senes rursus meminerimus, Vi clamabimus haud minore. Refrain Hac ex vita nos cesserimus, Nomen nostrum mox peribit; Sed in saecula mortis expers Tu manebis et veterrimus Honos tuus revirescens Juniores anteibit. Refrain Marshall also composed an English version: SONG OF THE ROYAL HIGH SCHOOLTrotter, Royal High School, pp. 138-9. Royal High School, hail to thee! Worth our worship, worth our praising! Like a tower set gloriously, \u2013 Like a sun \u2018mid clouds outblazing, \u2013 Shin\u2019st thou forth, whose song we\u2019re raising. Shine thou, shine eternally! Vivas Schola Regia! When in ages long departed, Small thy birthplace, small beginning, Yet \u2019midst omens loyal-hearted Into life thine entrance winning, Kind the Fates thy fortune spinning, Honour\u2019s race thou boldly started, \u2013 Vivas Schola Regia! Learning then thine advent prizing, Hailed thee gladly. Art and Science Joyed to watch thy fair uprising Venus-like, in storms\u2019 defiance, While the Muses bowed compliance, Such thy beauty\u2019s charm enticing. Vivas Schola Regia! Live thou on, with years increasing, Mother kind, our heart\u2019s best treasure! Let ambition, still unceasing, Lead where Duty weds with Pleasure, Glory seeking, yet in measure, Nought of base they thirst appeasing. Vivas Schola Regia! We thy children sound thy glory With hearts\u2019 united noising, And when years have told their story, And are youthful souls\u2019 rejoicing Changes to an older voicing, Still we\u2019ll chant, though heads be hoary, Vivas Schola Regia! Soon must come the day of dying; Soon our name and frame must perish. Yet shalt you, Death\u2019s power defying, Still have hearts thy fame to cherish, Still shalt grow and still shalt flourish, Younger wrestlers\u2019 strength outvying!
