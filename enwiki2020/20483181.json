In 2009, he has toured to Europe with his work Indivisible: polyphonic- poem for voices, violin, electronic processing, bells and whistlesOnline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdSZJD0YRm8&feature;=fvsr In his performances, Marcio-Andre uses the computer to processing, live, harmonics sounds and percussive sounds taken from the violin and voice. From this processing, from the creation of electronic textures and from loop recordings, it overlaps sound layers and folds to create a uniform mass of texts and sounds. In his plays are noted influences from noisy music, minimalist music and Eastern music, especially by the use of Tibetan chants and modes of Noh theater. He uses, yet, abstract projections, videodances and video loops projected onto the stage and incorporates various other props in presentations. == Main published works == * Intradoxos (Confraria do Vento, 2007) * Ensaios Radioativos (Confraria do Vento, 2008) * Poemas ap\u00f3crifos de Paul Val\u00e9ry (Confraria do Vento, 2014) * Leonardo contra Paris (Confraria do Vento, 2016) == Filmography == * Cidade Reposta (Short) Brazil, 2010 * Artaud en Compostela (Short) Spain, 2013 * The First Time I Saw Francis Taylor He Was in Slow Motion (Short) Hungary, 2016 * The concept of Irony (El concepto de iron\u00eda, Short) Spain/Hungary, 2017 * Man in the Crowd (Based on Edgar Allan Poe short story) Hungary, 2018 * Cosy for Two at Kuleshov St. (Short) Hungary, 2018 ==Notes== == External links == * * Poetry International Web * International Meeting of Poets * Category:Living people Category:Brazilian male poets Category:Brazilian literary critics Category:Brazilian translators Category:1978 births Category:21st-century Brazilian male writers Category:21st-century Brazilian poets ",
