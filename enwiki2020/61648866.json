    "text": "Boyfriend Dungeon is an upcoming dungeon crawler-dating sim indie game developed and published by Kitfox Games. Taking place in an urban fantasy setting, the player character must fight through dungeons with the help of a human partner who can transform into a sentient weapon. Outside of dungeons, the player can date their partner in visual novel-style sequences that increase their power in combat. It is scheduled for release on Nintendo Switch in 2020. == Plot == The main character, whose gender is selectable, lives in Verona Beach, a city in a contemporary fantasy world where monsters pose a danger to people. The player fights in dungeons, known as \"dunj\" in the world's slang, using weapons created from transformed humans or other creatures. The weapons can be dated to increase their power, although the game also contains a \"platonic\" relationship with a cat. The personalities of the weapon characters are based on their weapon type. == Gameplay == The game's combat takes place in real time from an isometric perspective. The player can perform different combos depending on their weapon. Outside of combat, there are visual novel-style dating sequences that allow the player to choose their responses. == Development == The game was funded via Kickstarter, where it raised $272,000 and surpassed its goal. One of its characters, Rowan, was designed by the artist of Hatoful Boyfriend. The developers stated that they wanted to make the romance elements \"as inclusive as possible\" and therefore allow players to date women and non-binary characters, despite the game's title. == Reception == GamesRadar+ stated that \"the game feels perfectly weighted to suit those who love either genre, yet doesn't alienate new players\". PCGamesN called it \"an intriguing curio\". == References == Category:Dungeon crawler video games Category:Romance video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Indie video games Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2020 Category:Video games about shapeshifting Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Single-player video games Category:Urban fantasy video games ",
