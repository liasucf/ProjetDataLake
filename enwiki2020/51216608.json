    "text": "Pang Sheng Jun (born 1992) is a Singaporean national swimmer. In 2011, Pang won a bronze in the men's 1500m freestyle to become the only other Singaporean to win a medal at the FINA Swimming World Cup. In 2015, he picked up his first individual Southeast Asian Games medal, clinching silver in the 400m individual medley. ==Personal life== Pang is the youngest son of Agnes Ng and Pang Boon Teng. He has two sisters who swam competitively until they were 16 years old when they decided to focus on their studies instead. Pang started swimming from the age of four upon doctor's recommendation due to his asthma. He began competitive swimming at six years old. In 2014, he received an Outstanding Sports Achievement Award for swimming from the Singapore Sports School. He is currently a Sports Science and Management student at the Nanyang Technological University and will graduate in 2018. ==Career== At the 2009 SEA Games in Laos, Pang, then 17 years old, saw his medal dreams crushed cruelly not once, but twice, when he finished fourth in the men's 200m and 400m individual medleys. He did not give up. Two years later, he was back at the 2011 SEA Games at Jakabaring Aquatics Centre in Palembang, determined to win a medal in his sole event, the 400m freestyle, but finished fifth. That could be said to be his lowest point in his swimming career. He had a near suicidal experience when he climbed up to the highest floor of his apartment building at the Games Village but his teammate and best friend Russell Ong stepped in just as he was about to take his last leap. Pang admitted that his demons \u2013 depression \u2013 never really went away, until he won gold with the men's 4x200m freestyle team at the Myanmar SEA Games in 2013. Despite the disappointment of missing out on the final cut for the 2016 Rio Olympics although he had clocked Olympic 'B' times in the 400m individual medley and freestyle, Pang is now set on winning honours at the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia, and plans to swim full- time after his graduation in 2018 as he targets an Olympic berth at the 2020 Tokyo Games. ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Singaporean male swimmers Category:Male medley swimmers Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent Category:Sportspeople of Chinese descent Category:Swimmers at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Swimmers at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Swimmers at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Singapore Category:Asian Games medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Southeast Asian Games medalists in swimming Category:Southeast Asian Games gold medalists for Singapore Category:Southeast Asian Games silver medalists for Singapore Category:Southeast Asian Games bronze medalists for Singapore Category:Competitors at the 2013 Southeast Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games Category:Competitors at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games ",
