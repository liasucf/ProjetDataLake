Members to serve in the Cabinet of Barbados may be chosen by the Prime Minister from either the House of Assembly or Senate,Constitution, Chapter VI, Part 3; Section 65(2) (the Prime Minister alone who must be chosen by the Governor-General must come from the House of Assembly.)Constitution, Chapter VI, Part 2; Section 65(1) In theory, supreme legislative power is vested in the Queen-in-Parliament; in practice during modern times, real power is vested in the House of Assembly, as the Governor-General generally acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and the powers of the Senate have been limited. The Parliament of Barbados is originally patterned after the Parliament of England, so the structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system of government. Sittings of both House and Senate are usually held once per month, with other meetings called as necessary. The House sits on Tuesdays beginning at 10:30am, and are broadcast live on the local radio station, Quality 100.7 FM. Sittings of the Senate take place on Wednesdays. ==History== Established on 26 June 1639.Greetings to (British) House of Commons to commemorate the Ter-centenary of the House of Assembly of Barbados, Sir Harold Austin, Speaker of the House of Assembly of Barbados. British Hansard The Parliament of Barbados is the third oldest legislature in the Americas (behind The Virginia House of Burgesses, and Bermuda House of Assembly), and is among the oldest in the Commonwealth of Nations. The genesis of a legislature in Barbados was introduced by Governor Henry Hawley, creating a structure of governance to Barbados, itself patterned after the Parliament of England). The then unicameral Parliament originally was tasked with establishing a system of laws and was completely under the domination of the island's planter-class. The first meeting of the Barbados Assembly was held in 1639. The initial location known as the \"Sessions House\" which was situated in the Marlhill, which is now known as Spry Street. Built by Captain Henry Hawley, the building may have originally accommodated his Courts of Law. (On 25 June 1989, a monument was unveiled to commemorate the site outside of the current Central Bank.) By 1653, the Assembly moved to the State House then located in Bridgetown area known as Cheapside (then encompassing Broad Street). In 1668 the State House was destroyed by a great fire started by an explosion of the Bridgetown military magazine. Over the next century, the colony\u2019s elected officials assembled at various locations all over Bridgetown, which were rented taverns and homes of local merchants and landlords. The Roebuck Tavern located on Roebuck Street was a favourite assembly point and was also owned by Henry Hawley. The movement of the Assembly among the various taverns in the town eventually presented an irony for the thriving colony. Governor Atkins, who was attending a meeting at Gwynn\u2019s Tavern in 1674 commented, \"I must confess I am a little astonished to see so honourable an Assembly to meet in a place so considerable as the island is, and have no house to receive us but a public tavern\" (TOB 71). For many years the Barbados Assembly continued to meet in various places. In 1724 an Act was passed providing for a building for the Council and Assembly, Law Courts and gaol. The building located on Coleridge Street was completed in 1731-1732, yet the House of Assembly still often met at times at different private houses and taverns. The current Parliament Buildings were built in the neo-Gothic style in the early 1870s on the site of what was known as the \"New Burnt District\", which was part of a 10-acre area in the town that was destroyed by the great fire in 1860. In 1968 the Barbados Parliament was presented two complete libraries of Parliamentary and constitutional works of reference from the British House of Commons to celebrate political Independence with membership to the Commonwealth. The Parliament of Barbados in its current form was first introduced following the 1961 general elections. In 1963 the colonial era Legislative Council was disestablished. In its place came the Senate in 1964 (due to Barbados' status as a colony of Great Britain). As the years went by, governance in Barbados continued to change in structure until both of the present chambers assumed their present numbers. ==Legislative functions== Parliament is empowered by Article 35(l) of the Constitution to make laws for the Peace, order, and good government of Barbados.Constitution of Barbados Section 48(1) The Constitution also empowers Parliament to: * Determine the privileges, immunities, and powers of the Senate and the House of Assembly and the members thereof;Section 48(2)(3) * alter or amend any of the provisions of the constitution;Section 49(1) ==Enactment clause== == Members in Parliament == As of the election held on 25 May 2018, the Barbados Labour Party won all 30 seats of the Assembly, reducing the Democratic Labour Party's seats to zero.

Atherley voluntarily opted to be appointed as the Opposition in the current Parliament. ==Election date== The next general election in Barbados is constitutionally due on 24 May 2023.
