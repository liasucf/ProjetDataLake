    "text": "Graves at Sea are a sludge/doom metal band that originally formed in 2002 by Nick Phit, Nathan Misterek, Roger Williams and Steve Klatz. The band kickstarted their career by self-releasing a demo titled Documents of Grief in 2003. Following this, they vigorously toured and gained the attention of by Greg Anderson of Southern Lord Records and of the drone metal band Sunn O))), whose label released the band's single, Cirrhosis b/w Atavist Arise in 2004. In 2005, Graves at Sea released a split with the death-doom band Asunder, which was followed by a line up change in 2007 when Misterek moved to Oakland and Phit moved to Portland, Oregon. In 2008, the band played two final shows with members Chiyo Nukaga of the band Noothgrush on drums and Miguel Veliz of Sourvein and The Roller on bass and broke up following this. Four years later in 2012 however, Graves at Sea reunited with Nukaga on drums and Greg Wilkinson of the band Brainoil on bass, but both would subsequently leave the band due to time constraints they faced. The band would go on to tour in Europe in 2013, followed by performances on the West Coast of the United States. In 2014, the band released a split album with the band Sourvein on Seventh Rule Records, followed by their second European tour, also with Sourvein, which included an appearance at Roadburn Festival. The band followed this by releasing an EP on Eolian Records titled This Place Is Poison followed by live performances at Maryland Deathfest and other US festivals. The band eventually released their debut full-length studio album titled The Curse That Is in 2016 on Relapse Records. ==Members== ===Current members=== * Nick Phit \u2013 guitars (2002\u201308, 2012\u2013present) * Nathan Misterek \u2013 vocals (2002\u201308, 2012\u2013present) * Jeff McGarrity \u2013 bass guitar (2013\u2013present) * Bryan Sours \u2013 drums (2013\u2013present) ===Former members=== * Tommy Cavizel \u2013 drums * Roger Williams \u2013 bass guitar (2002\u201306) * Steve Klatz \u2013 drums (2002\u201306) * Miguel Valiz \u2013 bass guitar (2007\u201308) * Chiyo Nukaga \u2013 drums (2007\u201308, 2012\u201313) * Greg Wilkinson \u2013 bass guitar (2012\u201313) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * The Curse That Is (2016) ===Other Releases=== * Documents of Grief (demo, 2003) * Cirrhosis b/w Atavist Arise (single, 2004) * Graves at Sea/Asunder (split, 2005) * This Place is Poison (EP, 2014) * Graves at Sea/Sourvein (split, 2014) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Phoenix, Arizona Category:Doom metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:American sludge metal musical groups ",
