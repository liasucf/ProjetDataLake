When the Bundeswehr was created in 1955, many traditional military terms were considered inappropriate after the German Wehrmacht's conduct in World War II. Therefore, the Bundeswehr has no \"General Staff\", but the \"Army Command\" (\"Kommando Heer\"). == List of officeholders == == See also == * Inspector of the Army * Inspector of the Navy * Inspector of the Air Force ==References== == External links == * List of Chiefs of Staff, Bundeswehr with personal data and photo (Official website of the Bundeswehr) Germany Category:German military personnel of the Bundeswehr ",
