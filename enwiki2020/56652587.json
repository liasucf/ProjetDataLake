    "text": "__NOTOC__ Belt Hill Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Thornlea about south- east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north west of the town centre in Hatherleigh. The conservation park occupies land in section 339 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Rivoli Bay. In 1971, the land was offered by its owner, A. McArthur of Rendelsham, to the \u201cthen National Parks Commission\u201d for \u201cdedication as a Reserve.\u201d On 27 April 1972, it was proclaimed as the Belt Hill Conservation Park when the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 came into force. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of \u201ca consolidated calcarenite dune overlain by weakly-structured sandy soils\u201d that \u201cextends from the east\u201d with a \u201cswale or low-lying plainwhich continues into adjacent farmland\u201d on its western side. The vegetation cover was described as consisting of \u201can open scrub formation\u201d of blackwood, and golden wattle\u201d on the dune with \u201cmainly introduced pasture grasses with some kangaroo grass\u2026 and knobby club-rush\u2026 covering the swale in the west. It was reported that native vegetation within the conservation park \u201chas been considerably disturbed mainly through grazing by stock and rabbits\u201d and during the early 1950s, a \u201crow of pine trees was planted on the southern boundary to control sand drift\u201d. In 1990, it was reported that two archaeological sites are located on the dune as evident by a \u201cthin scatter of artefacts\u201d on its surface. It is speculated that \u201cthe area supported a substantial Aboriginal population as it is elevated, well sheltered and watered, and would have offered many sources of food.\u201d Also, there was an abandoned stone quarry on the southern side of the conservation park and a sand pit in its north from which material was extracted for road construction by state government agencies. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== ==External links== *Belt Hill Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast ",
