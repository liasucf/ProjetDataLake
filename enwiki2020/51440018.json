    "text": "Dear Children is the fourth studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. It was the band's first album released through CBS Records in April 1987. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Dear Children \"represented a turning point in the band's career\". The album peaked at number 22 on the Kent Music Report in June 1987. ==Background and reception== The Black Sorrows had released three studio albums between 1984 and 1985 and had begun recording more original material. By November 1986 the Black Sorrows line-up was Joe Camilleri, Jeff Burstin, Peter Luscombe, Nick Smith and Johnny Charles, down from eleven members. Camilleri said that the line-up was \"a lot more rockier but it has to be that way because all the gentle side of it has gone \u2014 the accordion player has gone. We still do some wonderful ballads but there is a big difference between a nine-piece band [as on the Sorrows' last tour] and a five-piece band, something has to go.\" In November 1986, the band released \"Mystified\" which received significant radio play and peaked at number 24 on the Kent Music Report, this was the band's highest charting single at that point. The band also performed the song on Countdown. Camilleri said; \"I mortgaged the house to make Dear Children and then CBS Records stepped in and said: We like this record, we\u2019ll buy it off you\" The group signed to CBS for distribution. \"Daughters of Glory\" was released in March 1987 and made the top 50. == Track listing == ; Vinyl/ Cassette/ CD (CBS \u2013 450924 1) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1987) ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Kent Music Report | 22 |- |} ==Credits== * Accordion \u2013 George Butrumlis * Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Tambourine \u2013 Jeff Burstin * Backing Vocals \u2013 Nick Smith, Shirley Matthews, Venetta Fields * Bass \u2013 Mick Grabowski, Mike Girasole, Johnny Charles * Clarinet \u2013 John Barrett * Drums \u2013 Peter Luscombe * Electric Piano [Rhodes] \u2013 Don Nadi * Guitar \u2013 Jeff Burstin, Tony Faehse * Organ \u2013 Mick O'Connor * Piano, Keyboards, Marimba \u2013 Paul Grabowsky * Saxophone \u2013 John Barrett, Joe Camilleri * Slide Guitar \u2013 Tony Faehse * Trombone \u2013 John Courtney * Trumpet \u2013 Bob Vinter * Tuba \u2013 Karl Fritzlaff, Tim Jones ==References== ==External links== * \"Dear Children\" at discogs.com Category:1987 albums Category:The Black Sorrows albums Category:CBS Records albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
