    "text": "The 1993 UC Davis football team represented the University of California, Davis, in the 1993 NCAA Division II football season. This was the first and only season that UC Davis competed in the American West Conference (AWC). While the AWC was formed at the Division I-AA level, the Aggies were listed in Division II polls during the season, and participated in the Division II postseason. Apparently, this was due to a decision by the program not to offer scholarships. In 1994, they became an independent program in Division II. The Aggies were led by first-year head coach Bob Biggs and played their home games at Toomey Field. UC Davis finished the regular season as co-champion of the AWC (3\u20131 in conference), with an overall record of 9\u20131. This was the 24th consecutive year that UC Davis finished with a winning record. The Aggies qualified for the Division II playoffs, defeating Fort Hays State in a first round game. In a quarterfinal playoff game, they were defeated by Texas A&I.; That brought the Aggies' final overall record to 10\u20132. The Aggies outscored their opponents 460\u2013297 for the season. ==Schedule== ==NFL Draft== No UC Davis Aggies players were selected in the 1994 NFL Draft. ==Notes== ==References== UC Davis Category:UC Davis Aggies football seasons Category:American West Conference football champion seasons UC Davis Aggies football ",
