He is best known for playing William Tell in the adventure series The Adventures of William Tell (1958\u20131959). ==Life and career== Phillips was born Conrad Philip Havord in London, the son of Horace Havord who was a journalist and detective story writer. He attended St John's Bowyer School, Clapham, south London.Conrad Philips obituary, The Guardian. Retrieved 13 January 2016. He worked for an insurance company, and forged his birth date on his ration book so that he could join the Royal Navy at the age of 17. In three years of service during the Second World War he saw action in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea and survived the mining of a landing craft. He called himself 'Bill' in the navy because his shipmates kept ridiculing the name Conrad. His name wasn't changed to 'Phillips' until he started acting. His father had been using the name 'Conrad Phillips' as a pen name for his thriller writing, and suggested that his son use this as his stage name. In his autobiography, Conrad said that he regretted making that decision. He studied at RADA, and then appeared in repertory theatre and in the West End. He is best known for portraying William Tell in the popular ITV television series The Adventures of William Tell, which ran for 39 episodes from 1958 to 1959.William Tell details , televisionheaven.co.uk.
