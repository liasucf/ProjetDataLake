One night, after receiving a phone call from Marie, the woman he loves, Jean suddenly disappears without warning his brother.

One evening, they meet Harry Gold, a famous dancer, and she enjoys dancing with him. The following day, she finally let Jean take a picture of her. Jean is very happy, but the following morning, he finds she's gone away. The gardener says he has seen her leaving with Harry. Jean wants to go after them but he is delayed by a flat tyre. While Mary and Harry enjoy their love story while going on with their respective dancer and singer careers, Jean is desperate. Looking at the camera still containing Mary's unprocessed photo, he realises he will never see her again and shoots himself. At the same moment, his portrait hanging in J\u00e9r\u00f4me's house falls from the wall and he understands something terrible has happened to him. One day Mary faints during one of her shows.
