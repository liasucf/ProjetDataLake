    "text": "Defect Designer is a progressive death metal band from Oslo but originally coming from Akademgorodok, part of the Siberian city Novosibirsk. ==History== In 2007 Defect Designer in Novosibirsk recorded their first four-track promo named \"W\". Having sent the demo worldwide the band received plenty of positive feedback and decided to go to a European studio to record a full-length album. In February, 2008 Defect Designer entered Hertz Studio, Poland (which had previously recorded Vader, Decapitated, Behemoth, Sceptic) without any financial support from labels. The band traveled 4000 km from their hometown to Poland and recorded, mastered and mixed 12 tracks with the Wieslawski brothers. In 2009 the band were noticed by My Kingdom music and became the first metal acts from Siberia to have a worldwide release. In 2012 frontman relocated to Oslo severing ties with all members. Defect Designer released the second album \"Ageing Accelerator\" in 2015 - recording it with musicians from SepticFlesh, Cryptopsy and Trollfest. The current lineup includes Trollfest, Diskord and Vingulmork members. The band has signed a multi-album contract with Transcending Obscurity label in April, 2020 planning a release of the Neanderthal EP further in 2020. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Wax (September, 2009, My Kingdom Music) * Ageing Accelerator (2015, Sleaszy Rider Records) ;EPs * W (2007) - recorded in April, 2007 * AA (December, 2013, digitally) ;Compilations *V/A Siberian Death metal CD (2007) *V/A Putrid Tunes Compilation CD (2008) ==Video clips== * When Your Face Doesn't Melt Snowflakes - directed by Nader Sadek, taken from the \"Wax\" album. * Yellow Grimace lyrics video - directed by Richard Oakes * Crusaders lyrics video - directed by Richard Oakes * Cowboys lyrics video - Portishead cover * StarDust animated video * Wrinkles == References == * Legacy Zine Article * Heavy Impact Zine interview * Stereo Invaders Zine interview * Death Metal Without Borders - Defect Designer Going International With New Album * Defect Designer join Transcending Obscurity ==External links== * Defect Designer official website * Defect Designer start recording second album with Cryptopsy and SepticFlesh members at BW&BK; Category:Russian technical death metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Novosibirsk Category:Norwegian death metal musical groups Category:Technical death metal musical groups Category:Norwegian progressive metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from B\u00e6rum Category:Musical quartets ",
