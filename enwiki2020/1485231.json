    "text": "Giuseppe \"Bepi\" Colombo (October 2, 1920 in Padua \u2013 February 20, 1984 in Padua) was an Italian scientist, mathematician and engineer at the University of Padua, Italy. == Mercury == Colombo studied the planet Mercury, and it was his calculations which showed how to get a spacecraft into a solar orbit which would encounter Mercury multiple times, using a gravity assist maneuver with Venus. Due to this idea, NASA was able to have the Mariner 10 accomplish three fly-bys of Mercury instead of one. Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to use gravity assist. Since then, the technique has become common. Colombo also explained the spin-orbit resonance in Mercury's orbit, showing that it rotates three times for every two orbits around the sun. == Saturn's rings == Colombo also made significant contributions to the study of Saturn's rings, mostly using ground-based observations in the era before space exploration reached the outer solar system. == Other contributions == * Colombo invented the concept of tethers for tying satellites together. * Colombo participated in the planning of Giotto, the European Space Agency's mission to Halley's Comet, but died before the spacecraft was launched. == Legacy == * The Giuseppe Colombo Centre for Space Geodesy in Matera, Italy. * ESA awards a 'Colombo fellowship' each year to a European scientist working in the field of astronautics Several astronomical objects and spaceships are named after to honor him: * The ESA mission to Mercury, which launched at 1:45:28 UTC on 20 October 2018, is named BepiColombo.ESA Press Release: ESA's Mercury mission named BepiColombo in honour of a space pioneer * The Colombo Gap in Saturn's rings. * The asteroid 10387 Bepicolombo == References == == External links == * Biography from the University of Padua Category:University of Padua faculty Category:1920 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Italian engineers Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians Category:20th-century engineers ",
