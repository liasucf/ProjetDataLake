In the subsequent development of the park much of the original tree-lined layout by landscape architect Charles Leavitt from 1901 has been preserved; old buildings, however, were removed. The park can be crossed by car and has multiple parking lots. It has a multi-use, asphalted 2.25 mile trail. A nature path runs along Rock Brook. ==References== ==External links== * Somerset County Parks Category:County parks in New Jersey Category:Parks in Somerset County, New Jersey Category:Montgomery Township, New Jersey ",
