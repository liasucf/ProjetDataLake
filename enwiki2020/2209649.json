It provides more than 50 academic undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degree programs for over 5,000 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students. == History == In 1941 the Sisters of St. Dominic purchased 25 acres in Rockville Centre. In 1955 the Dominican Sisters of Amityville founded Molloy Catholic College. It was established as a women's college appointing Mother Anselma Ruth, O.P., Ph.D., as the first president. A year later the first institutional building called Quealy Hall opened. Soon after, Mother Bernadette de Lourdes, O.P., was appointed as the second president followed by the opening of Kellenburg Hall. In 1959 the first commencement ceremony took place celebrating the first graduating class. In 1971 its name was changed to Molloy College. In 1972 it began accepting men into the nursing program and in 1982 became fully coeducational. == Student life and graduation rates == Molloy College offers over 60 clubs and organizations. Some are founded on academics but others are centered around a cultural theme. 50.8% of four-year students actually graduate in four years. 71.8 graduate within 6 years. 77% of white students graduate in six years. 55.6% of Hispanic students graduate within 6 years. 50% of African-American students graduate within six years.https://www.scholarships.com/colleges/molloy-college/graduation-rates/ === Dorm life === Molloy has three residence halls that house nearly 350 students, Maria Regina, Fitzgerald, and Bogner Hall, which opened in August, 2019.
