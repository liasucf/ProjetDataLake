    "text": "Pat and Mike is a 1952 American romantic comedy film starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The movie was written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, and directed by George Cukor, who also directed The Philadelphia Story (1940) with Hepburn, and Adam's Rib (1949) with Hepburn and Tracy. == Plot == Pat Pemberton (Katharine Hepburn) is a brilliant athlete who loses her confidence whenever her charming but overbearing fianc\u00e9 Collier (William Ching) is around. Women's golf and tennis championships are within her reach; however, she gets flustered by his presence at the contests. He wants her to give up her goal and marry him, but Pat does not give up on herself that easily. She enlists the help of Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy), a slightly shady sports promoter. Together they face mobsters, a jealous boxer (Aldo Ray), and a growing mutual attraction. ==Cast== * Spencer Tracy as Mike Conovan * Katharine Hepburn as Pat Pemberton * Aldo Ray as Davie Hucko * William Ching as Collier Weld * Sammy White as Barney Grau * George Mathews as Spec Cauley * Loring Smith as Mr. Beminger * Phyllis Povah as Mrs. Beminger * Charles Buchinski as Hank Tasling * Frank Richards as Sam Garsell * Jim Backus as Charles Barry * Chuck Connors as Police Captain * Joseph E.
