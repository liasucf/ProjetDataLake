    "text": "Culver Field is a former Baseball ground located in Rochester, New York. Located at the northwest corner of University and Culver, Culver Field was home of the Rochester Broncos from 1886 until it burned down in 1892. Re-built for the 1898 season, the new Culver Field played host to the newly named Rochester Beau Brummels for a decade. However, the right field bleachers collapsed in 1906 leading to dozens of injuries and lawsuits. After the 1907 season, the ballpark was acquired by Gleason Works, which turned the site into the plant that stands to this day.Red Wings Baseball History ==References== Category:Sports venues in Rochester, New York Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Defunct sports venues in New York (state) Category:Baseball venues in New York (state) ",
