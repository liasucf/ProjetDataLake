She grew up rooting for the Detroit Tigers and her favorite player was Al Kaline. One evening in 1952, her brother Bud watched the Battle Creek Belles All-American Girls Professional Baseball team play in Battle Creek while his friend Sid announced the game. Bud talked to the public address announcer and went right home to Phyllis and told her she was good enough to play professional baseball, while adding that she needed to go over for a tryout. The 15-year- old girl went to a Belles tryout and was signed a contract, spending the year pitching batting practice while attending Marshall High School. In 1953 the team was moved to Muskegon, Michigan where they became the Muskegon Belles.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary \u2013 W. C. Madden.
