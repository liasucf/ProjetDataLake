    "text": "The Palatine Northern Railway () is a non-electrified single-track main line that connects Neustadt (Weinstr) Hbf with Monsheim in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It was opened between 1865 and 1873 in three stages. With the replacement of the old Ludwigshafen terminus with the modern Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof through station in 1969, Bad D\u00fcrkheim station became the only station in the form of a terminus in the Palatinate region. Passenger services over the Gr\u00fcnstadt\u2013Monsheim section were discontinued in 1984, but re-established in 1995. The name of the line comes from the Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pf\u00e4lzischen Nordbahnen), which acquired the line as its main line in 1870. Its importance lies in the fact that it connects the small towns of Deidesheim, Wachenheim, Bad D\u00fcrkheim, Freinsheim and Gr\u00fcnstadt with the railway network. ==Route == Neustadt (Weinstra\u00dfe) Hauptbahnhof Deidesheim station The Northern Railway runs through vineyards and open country near the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest. Starting at Neustadt Hauptbahnhof, it runs to Neustadt-B\u00f6big station parallel to the Palatine Ludwig Railway, later turning to the left towards the north. After passing the Neustadt suburb of Mu\u00dfbach and the small towns of Deidesheim and Wachenheim, the Northern Railway reaches the Bad D\u00fcrkheim terminal station. Trains reverse on to the northern branch, which then crosses the Rhine-Haardt Railway to reach Freinsheim at the junction with the line from Frankenthal. A few kilometres north just before reaching Gr\u00fcnstadt is the former junction with the Leiningen Valley Railway, which was finally abandoned in 2005. North of Gr\u00fcnstadt station, the Eis Valley Railway branches off to Ramsen and Eiswoog. Shortly before Albsheim the largely abandoned Worms\u2013Gr\u00fcnstadt railway branches off to Neuoffstein. At Bockenheim is the northern terminus of the German Wine Route and the last town in the Palatinate region. About four and a half kilometres north at Monsheim\u2014in Rhenish Hesse\u2014is the terminus of the Rheinhessen Railway. ==History == ===Planning, building and opening (1860-1873) === In 1860 a local committee was established to promote the construction of a railway from Neustadt via Bad D\u00fcrkheim to Frankenthal. In particular, the workers in Bad D\u00fcrkheim\u2019s factories would benefit from the proposed line. Although such a route would run parallel to the Palatinate Ludwig Railway and the Mainz\u2013Ludwigshafen railway, the promoters were optimistic that the planned route would be preferred because of its greater scenic appeal.Sturm, p. 169 The committee\u2019s appeal however, met with little support, as there were fears that it would create difficulties for the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company. For this reason, on 25 January 1862, it was agreed that only a local line would be built between Neustadt and Bad D\u00fcrkheim.Sturm, p. 169f On 22 August 1862, a concession was issued and two months later, the Neustadt\u2013D\u00fcrkheim Railway Company (Neustadt-D\u00fcrkheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was founded, which was intended to operate the route.Sturm, p. 170 Construction of the line, however, was delayed since the location of the station at Wachenheim was unclear at first. In addition, the hilly terrain proved to be a hindrance to the construction of the railway and several K\u00f6nigsbach wine makers continued to oppose the acquisition of their land. The Neustadt\u2013Bad Durkheim section opened on 6 May 1865.Holzborn, p. 34 On 21 March 1873, the Monsheim\u2013Gr\u00fcnstadt section was opened.Holzborn, p. 35 On 20 July 1873, the gap was closed between Bad D\u00fcrkheim and Gr\u00fcnstadt. It was decided not to move the station from Bad Durkheim, which for eight years had been end of the line; rather it served from 1873 as a terminal station from both directions. In 1870, the infrastructure of the line was taken over by the Palatine Northern Railway, the Neustadt-D\u00fcrkheim Railway Company was dissolved at the same time. ===Developments since 1873 === In 1909 the Palatine Northern Railway was taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. After the First World War the line became part of the German State Railways. At the end of World War II the line became part of Deutsche Bundesbahn. ==Operations == ===Passengers === Class 628 diesel multiple units Locomotive 42 of the Wincanton Rail in Gr\u00fcnstadt station (July 2007) Steam train 50 2740 at Gr\u00fcnstadt in the summer of 2005, running to Monsheim Operationally, the Northern Railway is divided in three sections, which are run separately: *Monsheim\u2013Gr\u00fcnstadt * Gr\u00fcnstadt\u2013Freinsheim *Freinsheim\u2013Neustadt an der Weinstrasse Between Monsheim and Gr\u00fcnstadt a pair of trains run every hour; between Gr\u00fcnstadt and Neustadt trains run every 30 minutes. The line is operated with class 628 diesel multiple units. The Freinsheim\u2013Gr\u00fcnstadt section is also part of route 666, which it addition to this section runs on the Freinsheim\u2013Frankenthal line and the Eis Valley line to Ramsen and Eiswoog. ===Freight traffic === During the sugar beet harvest the Northern Railway is very important for freight transport, particularly around Gr\u00fcnstadt station.Holzborn, p. 95 ==Sources== ===Notes=== ===References=== * * * Category:Railway lines in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Anterior Palatinate Category:Railway lines opened in 1865 Category:1865 establishments in Germany ",
