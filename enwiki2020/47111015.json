    "text": "Member institutions of the University of London are colleges and universities that are members of the federal University of London. The institutions that make up the university of London have been referred to by a number of different terms historically. From federation in 1900 until the passing of the University of London Act 1994 they were formally \"schools of the university\" or (until 1978) \"colleges incorporated into the university\", from 1994 until the passing of the University of London Act 2018 they were \"colleges\", and from 2018 they have been \"member institutions\". A member institution is defined in the 2018 act as \"an educational, academic or research institution which is a constituent member of the University and has for the time being \u2014 (a) the status of a college under the statutes; or (b) the status of a university\". This had the effect of allowing institutions to change their status from colleges to universities in their own right while still remaining part of the University of London. From 2003 onwards some colleges received their own degree-awarding powers. However, these were held in abeyance until 2008, when a number of colleges began to award their own degrees. ==Member institutions== The member institutions of the University of London are currently divided as follows, in alphabetical order: ===Colleges=== *Birkbeck, University of London (BBK) *City, University of London (CIT) *Courtauld Institute of Art *Goldsmiths, University of London (GUL) *Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) *King's College London (KCL) *London Business School (LBS) *The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) *London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) *Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) *Royal Academy of Music (RAM) *Royal Central School of Speech and Drama (RCSSD) *Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL) *Royal Veterinary College (RVC) *St George's, University of London (SGUL) *School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) *University College London (UCL) ===Former Colleges=== *Heythrop College, University of London (HEY) *Imperial College London (Imperial) File:Birkbeck College, University of London.jpg|Birkbeck File:Somerset House, Strand.jpg|Courtauld Institute of Art File:Goldsmiths Main Building.jpg|Goldsmiths File:Convent of the Assumption, Kensington Square, London W8 - geograph.org.uk - 1588014.jpg|Heythrop College File:Strand102.jpg|King's College London File:London Business School facade.jpg|London Business School File:The Land Registry Offices, Lincoln Inn Fields.jpg|London School of Economics and Political Science File:London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.jpg|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine File:Queen Mary & Westfield College.jpg|Queen Mary File:Royal Academy of Music London.jpg|Royal Academy of Music File:Embassy Theatre London.jpg|Royal Central School of Speech and Drama File:Royalvetcoll.jpg|Royal Veterinary College File:St-George s-Hospital.jpg|St George's, University of London File:UCL Portico Building.jpg|University College London ==References== Category:University of London ",
