I. \"Born of the Spaniard and the India is a Mestizo, who is generally humble, tranquil, and straightforward.\" Museo de Antropolog\u00eda, Madrid. 115 x 141 cm. Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Mag\u00f3n was a late eighteenth-century Mexican painter from Puebla de los Angeles. ==Biography== Little is known of his personal life, but he was a well-known artist who produced a large number of extant religious paintings and portraits of high ecclesiastics in Puebla.P\u00e9rez Salazar, Francisco. Historia de la Pintura en Puebla. Mexico: Imprenta Universitaria 1965, pp. 84-85 He also produced two sets of casta paintings in the 1770s, not mentioned in the works of art historians Manuel Toussaint and Francisco P\u00e9rez Salazar, who are silent on the genre of casta painting. One set of his casta paintings is signed and the other is identified as Mag\u00f3n\u2019s by Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Garc\u00eda S\u00e1iz.Garc\u00eda S\u00e1iz, Maria Concepci\u00f3n, Las castas mexicanas. Milan: Olivetti 1989, casta sets X and XI, pp. 90-111. Most of Mag\u00f3n\u2019s works are religious in theme and some can be found in churches in Puebla. He was commissioned to produce paintings \u201cfor the triumphal arch on the occasion of the crowning of Charles III.\"P\u00e9rez Salazar, Historia de la Pintura en Puebla, p.85. His two sets of casta paintings have the same groupings of couples and offspring in different racial categories, but one set includes qualitative assessments of the racial categories of the offspring. The first set is signed in 1772 and was brought back to Toledo, Spain by Archbishop Francisco Antonio Lorenzana. As with most casta paintings, there is no information on if or where such paintings were displayed, but Lorenzana founded a cabinet of natural history in the Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo. The cabinet attracted notice of travelers, including Antonio Ponz (1725-1792), who remarked on it in his publication Viaje de Espa\u00f1a.Katzew, Ilona. Casta Painting, New Haven: Yale University Press 2004, pp. 155-60. ==A set of Mag\u00f3n\u2019s casta paintings== Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Mag\u00f3n. Spaniard + Negra = Mulato.

Unique in the casta painting genre is this set is identified as by Mag\u00f3n, although the canvasses are unsigned. They are dated as approximately 1770.Katzew, Casta Painting, p. 154 Each canvas includes descriptions of \u201ccharacter and moral standings of these individuals\u201d depicted, some of which are quite pejorative, showing his low regard of mixed-race castas. The Spaniard with his India wife in canvas I is reading Don Quixote and, in canvas III, the Spaniard is seen writing and there are books on shelves behind him, among them Virgil. These are indicators of Spaniards\u2019 \u201ceducated character.\u201dGarc\u00eda S\u00e1iz, Las castas mexicanas, p. 102. Here are the descriptions on each of the canvases: \"In the Americas people of different colors, customs, temperaments and languages are born.\u201d [En la Am\u00e9rica nacen Gentes diversas en color, en costumbres, genios, y lenguas].
