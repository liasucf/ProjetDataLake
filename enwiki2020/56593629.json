    "text": "Falenta, also known as Fal\u0119ta, Falanta or Walenty (died after 22 May 1267) was a Polish Catholic priest, dean of the Gniezno chapter from 1262, and in 1265-1267 the Pozna\u0144 bishop.Korytkowski: Pra\u0142aci i kanonicy katedry metropolitalnej gnie\u017anie\u0144skiej od roku 1000 a\u017c do dni naszych. Pod\u0142ug \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 archiwalnych. vol. 2. (Gniezno: 1883), p.11\u201312.Jacek Maciejewski: Episkopat polski doby dzielnicowej, 1180-1320. (Tow. Nauk. Societas Vistulana, 2003). After the death of the Poznan bishop Bogufa\u0142 from Czerlin (December 1264), the Pozna\u0144 chapter took January 25, 1265 to his successor, the provost of Pozna\u0144's Pietrzyk. However, the Archbishop of Gniezno, Janusz, refused to approve the election and tried to impose his candidate, the dean of Gniezno, Falenta, who had the support of the Duke of Gniezno-Kalisz Boles\u0142aw the Pious. Under the pressure of Archbishop Pietrzyk, he resigned himself. The chapter took in his place the Archdeacon of John, but Janusz also rejected this candidacy and consecrated Falenta to the Bishop of Pozna\u0144. Then the chapter appealed to the Pope. Through the bishop of Wroclaw, Tomasz Falenta, he was called to appear in person at the curia, which he submitted to papal confirmation. After recognizing the case, Pope Clemens IV in the bull of May 22, 1267 annulled all previous candidacies and appointed one of his chaplains, Miko\u0142aj, to whom he also gave the episcopal consecration to the post of the Pozna\u0144 bishop. However, in the bullet against Falenty, the Pope used the wording venerabil fratrem nostrum V. episcopum quondam Poznaniensem, which suggests that he acknowledged the validity of his consecration. The fate of Falenty is unknown. He seems to have returned to the post of dean of Gniezno. The date of his death is also unknown. ==References== Category:Catholic bishops ",
