He was the godfather and namesake of Joseph's son Victor Hugo. He served in the revolutionary armies, but souring on Napoleon joined the Moreau conspiracy. When the plan fell apart in 1801, he was proscribed and went into hiding on the estate of Joseph Hugo. There the young Victor Hugo got to know the general. After fleeing abroad, he returned to France in 1808 and was arrested and held at La Force Prison. He was freed during the Malet coup of 1812, but after the coup's failure he was recaptured and executed. == References == ===Sources=== * Category:1766 births Category:1812 deaths Category:French generals Category:French military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Executed French people Category:People executed by the First French Empire Category:People executed by France by firing squad Category:People from Mayenne Category:Executed people from Pays de la Loire ",
