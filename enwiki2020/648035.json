The Eastern Counties Football League, currently known as the Thurlow Nunn League for sponsorship purposes, is an English football league at levels 9 and 10 of the English football league system. It currently contains clubs from Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, eastern Cambridgeshire, eastern Hertfordshire and north and east London and is a feeder to Division One North of the Isthmian League. ==History== ===Formation=== During the early part of the 20th century there were several leagues covering East Anglia, including the Norfolk & Suffolk League, the East Anglian League, the Essex & Suffolk Border League and the Ipswich & District League, whilst some of the larger clubs (including Ipswich Town and Cambridge Town) played in the Southern Amateur League. Suggestions of forming a league to cover the whole region had been made since the early 1900s, but intensified after Norwich City were promoted to Division Two of the Football League in 1934 and saw a significant rise in attendances.Blakeman, M (2010) The official history of the Eastern Counties Football League 1935\u20132010 Volume I During the 1934\u201335 season there was a strong movement in Harwich and Ipswich for the formation of such a league and after canvassing, a 'Meeting of Representatives of East Anglian Football Clubs' was held at the Picture House in Ipswich on 17 February 1935. The ten clubs in attendance were Cambridge Town, Harwich & Parkeston and Ipswich Town from the SAL, Colchester Town and Crittall Athletic from the Spartan League, and Gorleston, Great Yarmouth Town, King's Lynn, Lowestoft Town and Norwich CEYMS from the Norfolk & Suffolk League. Although Cambridge Town and Norwich CEYMS later decided against joining, a further four clubs were recruited; Bury Town and Thetford Town from the Norfolk & Suffolk League, Chelmsford City from the London League and Clacton Town from the Ipswich & District League. ===Early years=== The first season commenced on 31 August 1935 and ended with Harwich and Lowestoft level at the top of the league with 26 points each. Although Lowestoft had a better goal average, the championship was decided by a play-off match held at Layer Road on 29 August 1936. The match ended in a 3\u20133 draw and the two were declared joint champions and allowed to hold the trophy for six months each. At the end of the first season Ipswich left to join the Southern League and were replaced by their reserve team. At the end of the 1936\u201337 season there were concerns about the league's viability. All five Essex clubs had left to join the newly established Essex County League, whilst Thetford had resigned after finishing bottom of the league, leaving only six remaining clubs. However, four new members (Colchester United reserves, Cromer, Newmarket Town and Norwich CEYMS) were recruited. The following season the league expanded to 13 clubs as two of the Essex clubs rejoined (the Essex County League had been a failure with only five members completing the season and was not continued). The 1939\u201340 season started on 26 August, but was abandoned after the outbreak of World War II. After the war ended in May 1945 a meeting was held in late June to see whether the league could be restarted. However, a further meeting on 28 July decided that too few clubs were ready to resume footballing activities as many were unable to sign players and some grounds remained under the control of the armed forces. The league finally resumed for the 1946\u201347 season with ten clubs. ===Later development=== Prior to the start of the 1948\u201349 season the league was expanded to 16 clubs, largely through the addition of the 'A' teams of four London clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. The following season Gillingham reserves joined, becoming the only Kent-based club to ever play in the league (Dartford also applied to join at the same time, but were rejected). In 1951 the league gained its first Cambridgeshire club with the admission of Cambridge United, and by 1955\u201356 the league was up to 20 clubs, of which five were reserve or 'A' teams. Although a succession of clubs leaving the league saw it reduced to fourteen clubs by 1964, it quickly regained numbers and was back up to 18 members two years later. In 1976 the league was renamed the Eastern League, but returned to its original name six years later. The league was among the first to be sponsored by an external company when, in the late 1970s, it was sponsored by local building societies Magnet and Planet, and Town and Country. More recently it has been sponsored by building supplies company Jewson, Ridgeons, and current sponsor Thurlow Nunn. ===Expansion to two divisions=== There had been occasional discussions about adding a second division to the league since its formation, but in 1983 it seemed about to become a reality. However, it was then delayed by the Football Association at the request of the Essex Senior League. The idea was resurrected during the 1987\u201388 season and a meeting was held to discuss it on 22 November 1987. The league contacted 21 clubs who were considered potential members, of which fifteen were interested in joining. A further four clubs were contacted and another (Long Sutton Athletic) asked for details. Ultimately fourteen clubs applied to join the league; eight from the Peterborough & District League (Downham Town, Huntingdon United, King's Lynn reserves, Ortonians, Somersham Town, Warboys Town and Yaxley \u2013 Parson Drove also applied later in the year, but were rejected), three from the Anglian Combination (Diss Town, Fakenham Town and Wroxham) and three from the Essex & Suffolk Border League (Bury Town reserves, Hatfield Peverel and Little Oakley). All were accepted except Hatfield Peveral and Little Oakley, whose grounds were deemed inadequate, whilst Ortonians later withdrew after difficulties getting their reserve and 'A' teams into the Peterborough & District League. Mildenhall Town from the Cambridgeshire League and Ipswich Wanderers from the Ipswich Sunday League were later invited to join, whilst Halstead Town were persuaded to transfer from the Essex Senior League after Ortonian's late withdrawal, allowing the inaugural Division One season in 1988\u201389 to start with 14 clubs. ===Addition of Division One South=== On 3 October 2017, the FA ratified the creation of a new step 6 (level 10) division in the league, Division One South, which started playing in the 2018\u201319 season. It covers the rest of Essex, as well as east London and parts of north London and east Hertfordshire and is intended to enable promotion to the Essex Senior League and relegation to the Essex Olympian League. ==Current members (2019\u201320)== {| |- | Premier Division *Brantham Athletic *Ely City *FC Clacton *Godmanchester Rovers *Gorleston *Hadleigh United *Haverhill Rovers *Kirkley & Pakefield *Long Melford *Mildenhall Town *Newmarket Town *Norwich United *Stanway Rovers *Stowmarket Town *Swaffham Town *Thetford Town *Walsham-le-Willows *Whitton United *Woodbridge Town *Wroxham |valign=top| Division One North *AFC Sudbury Reserves *Cornard United *Debenham LC *Diss Town *Downham Town *Fakenham Town *Felixstowe & Walton United Reserves *Framlingham Town *Great Yarmouth Town *Haverhill Borough *Ipswich Wanderers *King's Lynn Town Reserves *Lakenheath *Leiston Reserves *March Town United *Mulbarton Wanderers *Needham Market Reserves *Norwich CBS *Sheringham *Wisbech St Mary |valign=top| Division One South *Barkingside *Benfleet *Brightlingsea Regent Reserves *Burnham Ramblers *Coggeshall United *Fire United *Frenford *Hackney Wick *Halstead Town *Harwich & Parkeston *Holland * *Little Oakley *Lopes Tavares *May & Baker *Newbury Forest *White Ensign *Wivenhoe Town *Wormley Rovers |} ===Former clubs=== Over sixty clubs have previously played in the Eastern Counties League, including several reserve and 'A' teams.
