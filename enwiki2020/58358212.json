    "text": "The Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales is an agency of the Government of New South Wales, Australia, forming part of the Department of Communities and Justice and headed by the State's Sheriff. The current Sheriff is Tracey Hall PSM. Sheriff's Officers are defined as Law Enforcement Officers under the Crimes Act 1900. They support the work of the State's court system, providing security at court complexes; enforcing writs, warrants and property seizure orders; and managing the jury system. The Office was established in 1824; prior to this its functions were exercised by the fledgling colony's provost marshal. The sheriff's Office managed NSW prisons until 1874. == Sheriffs of New South Wales == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Sheriffs of New South Wales !Date !Sheriff |- |1824\u20131827 |John Mackanass |- |1828 |William Carter |- |1829\u20131841 |Thomas Macquoid |- |1824 |William Hustler |- |1843\u20131849 |Adolphus William Young |- |1849\u20131854 |Gilbert Eliot |- |1855\u20131860 |John O'Neill Brenan |- |1861\u20131864 |George Richard Uhr |- |1864\u20131874 |Harold Maclean |- |1874\u20131896 |Charles Cowper |- |1896\u20131917 |Cecil Edmunds Bridgewater Maybury |- |1917\u20131920 |Charles Richard Walsh |- |1920\u20131925 |Walter William Crockford |- |1925\u20131939 |George Francis Murphy |- |1939\u20131945 |Harry Charles Lester |- |1945\u20131960 |Roland Oliver Elliot |- |1960\u20131968 |Donald Mercer Richardson |- |1968\u20131974 |Thomas Alexander Woodward |- |1974\u20131985 |George Francis Hanson |- |1985\u20131997 |David Michael Lennon |- |1997\u20131998 |Nerida Johnston (Acting) |- |1998\u20132002 |Bruce Kelly |- |2002\u20132003 |Kenneth Holdgate (Acting) |- |2003\u20132007 |Gary Byles |- |2007\u20132008 |Reg Kruit (Acting) |- |2008\u20132011 |Christopher Benjamin Allen |- |2012\u2013 |Tracey Hall |} == See also == * Coroner's Court of New South Wales * Corrective Services NSW * Supreme Court of New South Wales == References == ==External links== * History of the Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales Category:Government of New South Wales Category:Sheriffs ",
