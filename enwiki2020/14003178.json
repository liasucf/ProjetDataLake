In 2013, Khosla said that he started the company to explore the opportunities around Aadhar, the recently- implemented unique identity number system for residents of India. Khosla Labs has an Aadhaar-enabled authentication and verification product, called Aadhaar Bridge, and is licensed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) (which collects the data for the system) to use the demographic data of Aadhar holders. The company played an important role in the 'Coalition for Aadhar' by petitioning the Indian Supreme Court in 2018. There has been criticism around the private sector- UIDAI connections, and Khosla Lab has been used an example. The company has had many executives who were previously part of UIDAI. Khosla Labs has given a loan of 21 lakh to an NGO called eGovernments Foundation, of which Nilekani himself was a founder. Besides Nilekani, Sanjay Jain, the chief product manager for the UIDAI from 2010 to 2012 then went on to be an entrepreneur at Khosla Labs. Similarly, Vivek Raghavan was a biometrics volunteer with UIDAI from 2010 to 2013, and he was a director of Khosla Labs until 2016. ==References== *Khosla Ventures Goes Retro for New Blood.
