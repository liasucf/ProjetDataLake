    "text": "Parliaments and legislative bodies around the world impose certain rules and standards during debates. Tradition has evolved that there are words or phrases that are deemed inappropriate for use in the legislature whilst it is in session. In a Westminster system, this is called unparliamentary language and there are similar rules in other kinds of legislative systems. This includes, but is not limited to, the suggestion of dishonesty or the use of profanity. Most unacceptable is any insinuation that another member is dishonourable. So, for example, in the British House of Commons any direct reference to a member as lying is unacceptable. A conventional alternative, when necessary, is to complain of a \"terminological inexactitude\". Exactly what constitutes unparliamentary language is generally left to the discretion of the Speaker of the House. Part of the speaker's job is to enforce the assembly's debating rules, one of which is that members may not use \"unparliamentary\" language. That is, their words must not offend the dignity of the assembly. In addition, legislators in some places are protected from prosecution and civil actions by parliamentary immunity which generally stipulates that they cannot be sued or otherwise prosecuted for anything spoken in the legislature. Consequently, they are expected to avoid using words or phrases that might be seen as abusing that immunity. Like other rules that have changed with the times, speakers' rulings on unparliamentary language reflect the tastes of the period. The Table, the annual journal of the Society of Clerks-at-the-Table in Commonwealth Parliaments, includes a list of expressions ruled unparliamentary that year in the national and regional assemblies of its members. ==Partial list, by country== ===Australia=== In the Australian Senate, the words \"liar\" and \"dumbo\" were ordered to be withdrawn and deemed unparliamentary during a session in 1997. ===Belgium=== In Belgium there is no such thing as unparliamentary language. A member of parliament is allowed to say anything he or she wishes when inside parliament. This is considered necessary in Belgium to be able to speak of a democratic state and is a constitutional right. Nevertheless, on 27 March 2014, Laurent Louis called the Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo a pedophile. The other members of parliament left the room in protest. This immunity that manifests itself in an absolute freedom of speech when in parliament does not exist when outside of parliament. In that case prosecution is possible when and if the majority of parliament decides so. ===Canada=== These are some of the words and phrases that speakers through the years have ruled \"unparliamentary\" in the Parliament of Canada, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, and the National Assembly of Qu\u00e9bec: * Parliamentary pugilist (1875) * a bag of wind (1878) * inspired by forty-rod whisky (1881) * coming into the world by accident (1886) * blatherskite (1890) * the political sewer pipe from Carleton County (1917) * lacking in intelligence (1934) * a dim-witted saboteur (1956) * liar (1959) * devoid of honour (1960) * joker in the house (1960) * ignoramus (1961) * scurrilous (1961) * to hell with Parliament attitude (1961) * trained seal (1961) * evil genius (1962) * demagogue (1963) * Canadian Mussolini (1964) * sick animal (1966) * pompous ass (1967) * crook (1971) * does not have a spine (1971) * fuddle duddle (1971) * pig (1977) * jerk (1980) * sleazebag (1984) * racist (1986) * scuzzball (1988) * weathervane (2007) * a piece of shit (2011) * like a fart (2016) ===Hong Kong=== The President of the Legislative Council ordered out for using the following phrases: * (foul grass grows out of a foul ditch), when referring to some of the members (1996). The following phrases have been deemed unparliamentary by the President of the Legislative Council: * (literally stumble on street, loosely translated as \"go die\" or \"go to hell\") widely considered by Hong Kongers as unacceptable language in civil settings (2009). ===India=== In 2012, the Indian Parliament published a book of words and phrases that were considered to be unparliamentary: : Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, bad man, badmashi, bandicoot, blackmail, blind, deaf and dumb, bluffing, bribe, bucket of shit, communist, confused mind, dacoit, darling (said to a female MP), deceive, double-minded, double-talk, downtrodden, goonda, lazy, liar, loudmouth, lousy, nuisance, racketeer, radical extremist, rat, ringmaster, scumbag, thief, thumbprint (to an illiterate MP) ===Ireland=== In D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament), the chair (Ceann Comhairle or replacement) rules in accordance with standing orders on disorderly conduct, including prohibited words, expressions, and insinuations. If the chair rules that an utterance is out of order, then typically the member withdraws the remark and no further action occurs.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7\u00a7272, 275; D\u00e1il CPP 2010 p.8 \u00a714 The relevant words are retained in the Official Report transcription despite being formally withdrawn. The chair cannot rule if they did not hear the words alleged to be unparliamentary. A member who refuses to withdraw a remark may be suspended and must leave the chamber.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7\u00a7283(b), 286 A periodically updated document, Salient Rulings of the Chair, lists past rulings, ordered by topic, with reference to the Official Report. Rulings superseded by subsequent changes to standing orders are omitted.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \"Introduction to Fourth Edition\" It is disorderly for one Teachta D\u00e1la (TD; deputy) to \"call another Deputy names\",D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7427 specifically including:D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7428 : brat, buffoon, chancer, communist, corner boy, coward, fascist, gurrier, guttersnipe, hypocrite, rat, scumbag, scurrilous speaker, or yahoo; or to insinuate that a TD is lyingD\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7\u00a7421,425 or drunk.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7426 The word \"handbagging\" is unparliamentary \"particularly with reference to a lady member of the House\".D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7429; Allegations of criminal or dishonourable conduct against a member can only be made by a formal motion.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7414 Conduct specifically ruled on includes selling one's vote, violation of cabinet confidentiality,D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7419 and doctoring the Official Report.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7418 Charges against a member's political party are allowed; the chair decides whether an allegation is \"personal\" or \"political\".D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7431 Members may not refer to the D\u00e1il or its proceedings as a:D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann 2011, \u00a7444 :circus, farce, slander machine. During a December 2009 debate, Paul Gogarty said, \"With all due respect, in the most unparliamentary language, fuck you Deputy [Emmet] Stagg.\"; D\u00e1il CPP 2010 p.13 He immediately apologised and withdrew the remark. The debate's temporary chairman at the time lacked the Ceann Comhairle's power to suspend disorderly members;D\u00e1il CPP 2010 p.17 in any case, once Gogarty withdrew the remark he was not out of order, although his words led to general disorder in the chamber.D\u00e1il CPP 2010 p.8 \u00a7\u00a714\u201315 Gogarty's apology noted (\"rather tenuously\") that the word fuck was not explicitly listed in the Salient Rulings.; D\u00e1il CPP 2010 p.9 \u00a716 Ensuing calls for tougher sanctions led the D\u00e1il Committee on Procedure and Privileges (CPP) to refer the matter to a subcommittee,D\u00e1il CPP 2010 \u00a7\u00a71(1), 2(7\u20139 [recte 1\u20133]) which said the correct response was for the CPP to issue a formal rebuke, as had in fact been done to Gogarty.D\u00e1il CPP 2010 \u00a7\u00a79, 11, 21, 22, 24 After heated interruptions to a November 2012 debate, Ceann Comhairle Se\u00e1n Barrett said \"This is not a shouting match, like gurriers on a street shouting at each other.\" A spokesperson said gurriers was not out of order since it was not addressed at an individual. ===Italy=== In Italian history, the unparliamentarian language was the only limit to free speech of a deputy. So it was claimed by Giacomo Matteotti in his last discourse in the Chamber of Deputies: In addition, during the Republic, the use of foul language in Parliament produced jurisprudence by the constitutional court, which has implemented the libel suits.See Giampiero Buonomo, Lo scudo di cartone, Rubbettino Editore, 2015, p. 25 , ; see also ((https://www.academia.edu/12695276/Autorecensione_02_dello_Scudo)). ===New Zealand=== The Parliament of New Zealand maintains a list of words, and particularly phrases, that the Speaker has ruled are unbecoming, insulting, or otherwise unparliamentary. These include:\"Special topics: unparliamentary language\", Parliament of New Zealand website, dated 28 July 2006, retrieved 16 April 2016. * idle vapourings of a mind diseased (1946) * his brains could revolve inside a peanut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides (1949) * energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral (1963) The Parliament also maintains a list of language that has been uttered in the House, and has been found not to be unparliamentary; this includes: * commo (meaning communist, 1969) * scuttles for his political funk hole (1974) ===Norway=== In 2009, a member of the Progress Party was interrupted during question period by the Speaker for calling a minister a \"highway bandit\". ===United Kingdom=== In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the following words have been deemed unparliamentary over time: :bastard, blackguard, coward, deceptive, dodgy, drunk, falsehoods, git, guttersnipe, hooligan, hypocrite, idiot, ignoramus, liar, pipsqueak, rat, slimy, sod, squirt, stoolpigeon, swine, tart, traitor,\"Unparliamentary language\", BBC News website, 31 October 2008, retrieved 3 April 2009 wart In addition, accusations of 'crooked deals' or insinuation of the use of banned substances by a member are considered unparliamentary language (all attributable to Dennis Skinner). An accusation that an MP's presence in the house has \"been bought\" is also unparliamentary. The word 'dodgy' when used by Ed Miliband, was not however, found to be unparliamentary. In 2019, in the run up to the Conservative leadership election, SNP leader Ian Blackford accused Boris Johnson of being a racist. Asked to withdraw the term by the speaker, Blackford confirmed that he had informed Johnson about his intention to use it and qualified his statement. The speaker then allowed it to stand. In the following week he accused Johnson of being a liar (\"has made a career out of lying\"). No request was made by the speaker to withdraw this statement. ====Northern Ireland==== The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, William Hay MLA, gave a ruling in the Chamber on 24 November 2009 on unparliamentary language. In essence rather than making judgements on the basis of particular words or phrases that have been ruled to be unparliamentary in the Assembly or elsewhere the Speaker said that he would judge Members' remarks against standards of courtesy, good temper and moderation which he considered to be the standards of parliamentary debate. He went on to say that in making his judgement he would consider the nature of Members' remarks and the context in which they were made. In 2013, Hay ruled that insinuation of MLAs being members of proscribed organizations was unparliamentary language. ====Wales==== In the National Assembly for Wales the Presiding Officer has intervened when the term \"lying\" has been used. In December 2004, the Presiding Officer notably sent Leanne Wood out of the chamber for referring to Queen Elizabeth II as 'Mrs Windsor'. ===United States=== In the US, representatives were censured for using unparliamentary language in the House of Representatives throughout its history. Other levels of government have similar disciplinary procedures dealing with inappropriate words spoken in the legislature. ==Avoiding unparliamentary language== It is a point of pride among some British MPs to be able to insult their opponents in the House without use of unparliamentary language. Several MPs, notably Sir Winston Churchill, have been considered masters of this game. Some terms which have evaded the Speaker's rules are: *Terminological inexactitude (lie) *Being economical with the truth (lying by omission), since used on the floor of the house as an insult or taunt. *Tired and emotional, a euphemism for intoxicated Clare Short implicitly accused the Employment minister Alan Clark of being drunk at the dispatch box shortly after her election in 1983, but avoided using the word, saying that Clark was \"incapable\". Clark's colleagues on the Conservative benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Speaker asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment. In 1991, Speaker Bernard Weatherill adjudged that usage of the word \"jerk\" by Opposition leader Neil Kinnock was not unparliamentary language.\"European Community (Intergovernmental Conferences)\". theyworkforyou.com. ==Notes== ===Sources=== * * ===Citations=== ==External links== * Short definition * CBC News: Political insults: a short history of personal attacks Category:Westminster system Category:Euphemisms Category:English phrases Category:Parliamentary procedure ",
