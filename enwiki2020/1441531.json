It was formed in 1909 by members of six amateur rowing clubs (known as the \"founding clubs\") on the River Thames: * Kingston Rowing Club * London Rowing Club * Molesey Boat Club * Staines Boat Club * Thames Rowing Club * Twickenham Rowing Club The seventh founding club, Vesta Rowing Club, was invited to join shortly after the second World War. Although originally open to any past or present member of a rowing club affiliated to the Amateur Rowing Association, in 1947 membership was restricted to members of the founding clubs. Currently, those wishing to join must have raced competitively for a period of years with their founding club, won enough status points, and displayed sufficient proficiency in oarsmanship to qualify. Remenham Club is a social club only as members are not allowed to race under the club's name. Situated approximately halfway down the Henley Royal Regatta course, a marquee is conveniently placed on \"the mound\" during the regatta, which allows members to look down at the throngs squeezing past on the towpath and, due to the restricted number of guest tickets available, offers a good view of the racing throughout the whole five days without ever getting uncomfortably busy. The club acts as the finish line for the Henley Women's Regatta. ==See also== *Rowing on the River Thames ==External links== *Remenham Club *The Rabbit's Guide to Henley Royal Regatta Category:1909 establishments in England Category:Henley-on-Thames Category:Organisations based in Berkshire Category:Henley Royal Regatta Category:Rowing in Berkshire ",
