Already interested in dress as a way of visibly meshing a multicultural background, he decided that cowboy boots were an ideal fit in more ways than one. They were comfortable and suitable to his long stride and natural rhythm while versatile enough to wear with anything from jeans to suits. When people noticed his boots, he was pleased; not only did the boots reinforce his desire to be more individualistic, \"they were a symbolic indication of my enrichment, the boot being something of the West and also a foreshadowing of my coming to Los Angeles.\" \"Interview with Sammy Hoi\" in Garb: A Fashion and Culture Reader,\" edited by Parme Giuntini and Kathryn Hagen, Prentice Hall, 2007. p. 47. == Further reading == * Dean of Design, Samuel Hoi Interview Los Angeles Business Journal, July 24, 2000 * Arts Education and the Economy, from Which Way LA?, a radio program of KCRW * KCET Video Interview with Sammy Hoi * Report of the Creative Economy of the Los Angeles Region * Speech by President Samuel Hoi at Otis College of Art and Design Commencement, 2003 * President's Messages * \"Interview with Sammy Hoi\" in Garb: A Fashion and Culture Reader, edited by Parme Giuntini and Kathryn Hagen * Video Interview with Samuel Hoi ==Notes== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Columbia Law School alumni Category:Heads of universities and colleges in the United States Category:Hong Kong people Category:Otis College of Art and Design Category:Officiers of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques Category:Parsons School of Design alumni Category:Maryland Institute College of Art faculty Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni ",
