    "text": "Code of Honor is a 2016 American action thriller film written, produced, edited, and directed by Michael Winnick. The film stars Steven Seagal and Craig Sheffer and was released to video on demand on May 6, 2016. ==Plot== Colonel Robert Sikes is a stealthy, one-man assault team who takes on a city's street gangs, mobsters, and politicians until his mission is complete. His former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, William Porter, teams up with the local police department to bring his former commander to justice and prevent him from further vigilantism. ==Cast== *Steven Seagal as Col. Robert Sikes *Craig Sheffer as Maj. William Porter *Helena Mattsson as Keri Green, a stripper *Louis Mandylor as Det. James Peterson *James Russo as Romano, a mobster *Griff Furst as Jerry Simon, a reporter *Rafael Petardi as Carlos, Romano's ally *Michael Flynn as Capt. Connely *R.D. Call as Mayor Randolf *Scott Takeda as Johnny Ito ==Production== Writer-director Michael Winnik said he wanted to make \"First Blood meets Death Wish.\". Seagal liked the script and an earlier film of Winnik's, Guns, Girls And Gambling and agreed to make the film. The film was shot in Utah in March 2015 on a budget of $8 million. The shooting schedule was 20 days. Winnik said of Seagal, \"he\u2019s definitely the real deal... he really knows his guns, his Aikido, his martial arts, his fighting skills. You know, he\u2019s teaching you weapons, he\u2019s teaching you moves. He\u2019s been around a long time, but his arms, his hands, they\u2019re still lightning fast.\" In the movie, Seagal's character dies. Winnik says the actor was not pleased with this and \"if you ask him, he didn\u2019t [die]. He escaped. That said, the implication, the way the film is structured, is that he does. Obviously you can interpret it as you wish, but yes, he does go down. And that\u2019s kind of what he\u2019s been saying throughout the film. 'Would you give your life to save the world if no one knew you did it?' is the question he keeps posing. He\u2019s completed his mission and he\u2019s even made the other character take the fall for it.\" ==Reception== The film received negative reviews from critics. In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Abele called it \"dreadful\" and \"laughably awful\". Frank Scheck wrote in The Hollywood Reporter that the film includes almost every B-action clich\u00e9, and stated that \"the latest effort from the bloated, aging star is... as bland as its title.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2016 films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2016 action thriller films Category:2016 crime drama films Category:American action thriller films Category:Films shot in Salt Lake City Category:2016 drama films ",
