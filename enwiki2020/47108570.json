This lens, at its time of manufacturing, was considered a game changer due to it being the only standard zoom boasting a constant f/1.8 aperture. The lens was designed specifically for crop body DSLRs enabling a crop factor adjusted (full frame equivalent) of f/2.88 for canon or f/2.7 for Nikon crop body DSLRs across an equivalent range of 28mm-56mm (Canon full frame adjusted) or 27mm-53mm (Nikon full frame adjusted).
