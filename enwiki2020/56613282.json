She is remembered for voting in the municipal elections in 1863 and 1866 before women were officially given voting rights. ==Biography== Born on 1 March 1802, Vilhelm\u00edna Lever was the daughter of Hans Vilhelms Lever, a merchant, and his wife \u00deur\u00ed\u00f0ur Sigf\u00fasd\u00f3ttir. She married Thord Dan\u00edelsson but obtained a divorce in 1824, becoming the first woman in Iceland to apply for a divorce. She bought a plot of land in Akureyri in 1834, built a small house and opened a shop in 1835. After spending a few years in Krossanes, she returned to Akureyri in 1852 to run a shop combined with a restaurant. In 1861, she opened a restaurant in the Oddeyri district of Akureyri. She ran it for years, gaining the nickname \"Vertsh\u00fas-M\u00edna\" or Tavern-Mina. New regulations in Danish stated that the town council could be elected by \"alle fuldmyndige M\u00e6nd\" (all men who have reached their majority) who had lived in the town for two years and paid municipal dues. Assuming \"m\u00e6nd\" meant all people (as in Icelandic) and not just men, Vilhelm\u00edna voted in the municipal elections in both 1863 and 1866. Later Vilhelm\u00edna lived in Nonnah\u00fas (Nonni's House), Akureyri's oldest house. She died in Akureyri on 19 June 1879. ==References== Category:1802 births Category:1879 deaths Vilhelmina Lever Vilhelmina Lever Vilhelmina Lever Category:19th-century businesswomen Category:19th-century Icelandic people Category:19th-century Icelandic women ",
