    "text": "The South Australian Government Gazette is the government gazette of the South Australian Government. First printed on 20 June 1839, the South Australian Government chose to have its own publication rather than using the local newspaper, South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register because the publishers were perceived as politically biased. The purpose was to publish government orders and acts with authority of the colonial secretary. Initially it was called South Australian Gazette. ==References== ==External links== *PDF images of the gazette from 1839 to 1999 - *PDF images and .DOC formats from 1999 till present - Category:Government gazettes of Australia Category:Publications established in 1839 Category:Government of South Australia ",
