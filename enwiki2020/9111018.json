    "text": "Double Fun is the fourth solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1978. Self- produced, this pop album is influenced by multiple genres including blue-eyed soul, disco and heavy rock but maintains an overall consistency of production which holds it all together. The album peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart in 1978, his highest rank up to that point, and includes a top 20 hit, \"Every Kinda People.\" The hit single from the album \"Every Kinda People\" was written by former Free bassist Andy Fraser. Fraser recorded his own version of the song which he never released but which Palmer heard. This album and the hit single paved the way for his next album Secrets which reached No. 19 on the Billboard charts and gave Palmer his biggest hit yet with the Moon Martin penned \"Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)\". The album cracked the Billboard Top 100 peaking at No. 45 thanks to the success of \"Every Kinda People\", and two follow up singles continued to keep the album afloat on the charts. The last track \"You're Going To Get What's Coming\" penned by Palmer later became a hit single (reaching No. 73 on the Billboard Charts in 1980) for Bonnie Raitt and was featured on her 1979 album The Glow. Double Fun peaked at No. 10 in the Netherlands and No. 29 in New Zealand. ==2012 reissue== Double Fun was reissued on 24 January 2012 by Culture Factory USA, an independent label that specialises in cult artists. The reissue CD is packaged in a miniature replica of the original quality vinyl packaging complete with an inner sleeve that features the original lyrics, photo of Palmer and credits for the album. The label side of the CD features a replica of what the original Island label looked like at the time of issue and even features \"grooves\" as if the black CD is made of vinyl. The reissues did not have any additional outtakes or bonus tracks. ==Track listing== All songs by Robert Palmer except where noted. #\"Every Kinda People\" (Andy Fraser) \u2013 3:17 #\"Best of Both Worlds\" \u2013 3:54 #\"Come Over\" \u2013 4:06 #\"Where Can It Go?\" \u2013 3:20 #\"Night People\" (Allen Toussaint) \u2013 4:12 #\"Love Can Run Faster\" \u2013 4:02 #\"You Overwhelm Me\" \u2013 3:05 #\"You Really Got Me\" (Ray Davies) \u2013 4:23 #\"You're Gonna Get What's Coming\" \u2013 4:29 ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1978) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 75 |- |United States (Billboard 200) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 45 |} ==Personnel== *Robert Palmer \u2013 vocals, guitar, percussion *Paul Barr\u00e8re \u2013 guitar, backing vocals *Keith Errol Benson, Richie Hayward, Chris Parker \u2013 drums *Harry Bluestone \u2013 concertmaster *Michael Brecker \u2013 saxophone *Randy Brecker \u2013 trumpet *Pierre Brock, Jimmy Williams, Bob Babbitt \u2013 bass guitar *Lenny Castro, Robert Greenidge \u2013 percussion *Gene Davis \u2013 string arrangements *John Davis \u2013 string arrangements *Freddie Harris, Neil Hubbard, James Mahoney, Donovan McKitty, T.J.
