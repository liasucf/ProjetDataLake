Smith and Nancy Schimmel \u2013 Accessed Nov 2006 ==Early life== Malvina Milder was born in San Francisco to David and Abagail Milder, Jewish and socialist immigrants, who opposed involvement in World War I. She married William (\"Bud\") Reynolds, a carpenter and labor organizer, in 1934. They had one child, Nancy Reynolds Schimmel (a songwriter and performer), in 1935. Malvina earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in English from the University of California, Berkeley, and later earned a doctorate there, finishing her dissertation in 1938. ==Music career== Though she played violin in a dance band in her twenties, Reynolds began her songwriting career late in life. She was in her late forties when she met Earl Robinson, Pete Seeger, and other folk singers and songwriters. She returned to school at UC Berkeley, where she studied music theory. Reynolds went on to write several popular songs, including \"Little Boxes\" (1962), recorded by Seeger and others, \"What Have They Done to the Rain\" (1962), recorded by The Searchers, The Seekers, Marianne Faithfull, Melanie Safka and Joan Baez (about nuclear fallout), \"It Isn't Nice\" (1964) (a civil rights anthem), \"Turn Around\" (1959) (about children growing up, later sung by Harry Belafonte), and \"There's a Bottom Below\" (about depression). Reynolds was also a noted composer of children's songs, including \"Magic Penny\" and \"Morningtown Ride\" (1957), a top-5 UK single (December 1966) recorded by The Seekers. Malvina lived on Parker Street in Berkeley. Four collections of Reynolds' music are available on compact disc. The Smithsonian Folkways label released Another County Heard From (Folkways 02524) and Ear to the Ground (Smithsonian Folkways 40124), and the Omni Recording Corporation in Australia issued Malvina Reynolds (Omni 112) and Malvina Reynolds Sings the Truth (Omni 114). A film biography, Love It Like a Fool, was made (1977) a year before she died in 1978. Reynolds' most famous song, \"Little Boxes\" (made famous by Seeger), has enjoyed renewed popularity by being featured in Showtime's TV series Weeds. \"Little Boxes\" was inspired visually by the houses of Daly City, California. Nancy Reynolds Schimmel, Reynolds' daughter, explained: > My mother and father were driving South from San Francisco through Daly City > when my mom got the idea for the song. She asked my dad to take the wheel, > and she wrote it on the way to the gathering in La Honda where she was going > to sing for the Friends Committee on Legislation. When Time Magazine (I > think, maybe Newsweek) wanted a photo of her pointing to the very place, she > couldn't find those houses because so many more had been built around them > that the hillsides were totally covered.Malvina Reynolds profile , Weeds, > homegrownseries.com. Retrieved 16 October 2007. In her later years, Reynolds contributed songs and material to PBS' Sesame Street, on which she made occasional appearances as a character named Kate. ==Activism== In 1977, Reynolds became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. ==Other== In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Reynolds's name and picture. Reynolds was a Unitarian Universalist. ==Legacy== Reynolds' song \"Little Boxes\" was used as the theme for the TV show Weeds. In 2020, most of the second verse of her one-minute ditty \"Place to Be,\" as recorded by her, was used as the sound for a Zillow commercial. ==References== ==External links== * Biography at Sister's Choice * Memories of her mother, by Malvina Reynolds' daughter * Smithsonian Folkways- Malvina Reynolds * Malvina Reynolds: Song Lyrics and Poems * Complete discography Category:1900 births Category:1978 deaths Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Jewish American musicians Category:American folk singers Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Songwriters from San Francisco Category:Singers from San Francisco Category:American female singer- songwriters Category:20th-century American singers Category:Activists from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Jewish folk singers Category:American Unitarian Universalists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American folk guitarists Category:American blues guitarists Category:American acoustic guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Guitarists from San Francisco Category:20th-century American women singers Category:Jewish female musicians ",
