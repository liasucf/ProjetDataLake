    "text": "La Muerte Viva! is The Bronx's second EP and the first recording on Wichita Records, released on November 15, 2003. The EP was only largely released both in Europe and Australia and being limited edition has since become somewhat of a collectors item. ==Track listing== *All tracks by The Bronx, except \"Private Affair\" written by The Saints The Australian version was printed with the track names in the wrong order on the case as well as in the booklet. On the actual CD \"Private Affair\" is Track 4 instead of Track 6, \"Bats\" is Track 5 instead of Track 4 and \"You want to see us burn\" is Track 6 instead of Track 5. The track listing above matches the order on the CD. The booklet is folded differently from the U.K. Version. ==Personnel== *Jorma Vik - drums *Matt Caughthran - vocals *Joby J. Ford - Guitar *James Tweedy - Bass Category:2003 EPs Category:The Bronx (band) EPs Category:Shock Records EPs Category:Wichita Recordings EPs ",
