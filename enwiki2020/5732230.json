    "text": "Prolibytherium is an extinct climacoceratid artiodactyl ungulate native to Early Miocene North Africa and Pakistan, from around 16.9 to 15.97 million years ago. Fossils of Prolibytherium were found in the Marada Formation of Libya, Vihowa Formation of Pakistan, and the Moghara Formation of Egypt. == Description == The long creature would have superficially resembled an okapi or a deer. Unlike these, however, Prolibytherium displayed dramatic sexual dimorphism, in that the male had a set of large, leaf-shaped ossicones with a width of , while the female had a set of slender, horn-like ossicones. The taxonomic status of Prolibytherium remains in flux. At one time, it was described as a relative of Sivatherium (as a precursor to \"Libytherium maurusium\" (S. maurusium)). Later, it would be regarded as a palaeomerycid, or either as a climacoceratid, or as a basal member of Giraffoidea. With the discovery and study of a female skull in 2010, Prolibytherium is tentatively confirmed as a climacoceratid. == References == Category:Climacoceratidae Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Mammalian incertae sedis Category:Miocene mammals of Africa Category:Fossils of Egypt Category:Fossils of Libya Category:Miocene mammals of Asia Category:Fossils of Pakistan Category:Fossil taxa described in 1961 ",
