    "text": "\"Sexodus\" is a song by English rapper M.I.A. from her fourth studio album, Matangi (2013). It is written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam and British record producer Switch, Doc McKinney, Illangelo, and The Weeknd are also credited due to a sample of The Weeknd's song \"Lonely Star\" from his mixtape Thursday. The album version of the song was noted for its \"striking\" similarities to a different song from the album, \"Exodus\". However, the single version features War Syntaire and was labelled as being \"Re-Loaded With War\". Before the track was recorded by M.I.A., she offered the song to Madonna. The song was originally titled \"This Exodus\", before the \"Thi\" was deleted and M.I.A. kept the typo. M.I.A. performed the song live during her 2013\u201314 Matangi Tour. ==Track listing== ;Digital download # \"M.I.A.'s Sexodus Re-Loaded With War\" \u2013 4:54 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Matangi. * M.I.A. \u2013 vocals * Hit-Boy \u2013 production * War Syntaire \u2013 production, guitar * Haze Banga \u2013 engineering; co-production; mixing * Geoff Pesche \u2013 mastering ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | 25 May 2015 | | Interscope | align=\"center\"| |} ==References== Category:2013 songs Category:2015 singles Category:British contemporary R&B; songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:M.I.A.
