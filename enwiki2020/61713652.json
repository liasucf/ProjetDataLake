In his career he worked mostly for public broadcasting stations, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (Central German Broadcasting) and later ARD. Hampel entered the newly founded AfD in 2013 and was chairman of the Landesverband (federal state association) of the party in Lower Saxony from 2013 to 2017. In 2017 a criminal investigation because of alleged fraud and tax evasion was conducted against Hampel; the lawsuit was abandoned without taking action. At the German federal election in September 2017, AfD \u2014 which was previously unrepresented in the Bundestag \u2014 became the third party in the Bundestag with 12.6% of the vote. The AfD got 94 of the 709 Bundestag seats; Hampel has one of them. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1957 births Category:Alternative for Germany politicians Category:People from Bielefeld Category:ARD (broadcaster) people Category:Members of the Bundestag 2017\u20132021 Category:Members of the Bundestag for the Alternative for Germany Category:Members of the Bundestag for Lower Saxony ",
