The Chand Kings were a Hindu ruling clan of Kumaon, which ruled the region after the decline of Katyuri Kings in 11th century AD. ==History== ===Inception=== The Chand kingdom was established by Som Chand in the 10th century, by displacing the Katyuri Kings, who had been ruling the area from the 7th century AD. He continued to call his state Kurmanchal, and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon, called so, due to its vicinity to river Kali. Many temples built in this former capital city, during the 11th and 12th century exist today, this include the Baleshwar and Nagnath temples.O.C.Handa, 2002, History of Uttaranchal, Indus Publishing Company. , . Later their capital was shifted to Almora by Raja Kalyan Chand in 1563, when he laid the foundation of a town name 'Alam Nagar', which was also called, 'Rajapur',History of Almora city Champawat British Library. a name that still used and has been found inscribed on a number of copper plates of the time.Kumaon Official website of Almora district. In 1581, the Chand King, Rudra Chand (1565\u20131597), son of Raja Kalyan Chand seized Sira defeating Raika king Hari Malla and attacked the Garhwal Kingdom for the first time, though this attack was repulsed by then king, Dularam Sah,Garhwal history www.garhwalhimalayas.com. and so were his subsequent attacks. Rudra Chandra was a contemporary of Akbar, and even paid him a visit in Lahore in 1587, as a mark of his obeisance. Akbarnama mentions him as \"one of the great landlords of India\", and further talks about his initial hesitation in approaching the court of Akbar, it was only Raja Todar Mal himself, sent his son Kalyan Das to assure him, did his proceed to meet Akbar. Subsequently, the two met and agreed on a concord,Rudra Akbarnama of Abu Fazl, Volume 3, chpt. 196.p807, \"On 9 \u0100\u1e93ar he received the felcity...\"1588 and thus Ain-e-Akbari, written during period of Akbar, also mentions the Sarkar of Kumaon, containing 21 Mahals (a geographical unit of the times) and the revenue collected.Sark\u00e1r of Kum\u00e1on Ain-e-Akbari Vol II, pp. 289. After death of Rudra Chand in 1597, his son, Lakshmi Chand, also continued attacks of Garhwal for many years, though he too was repulsed. He also constructed the \u2018Bagnath temple\u2019 at Bageshwar in 1602. ===Peak=== One of most powerful rulers of the Chand dynasty was Baz Bahadur (1638\u201378), who met Shahjahan in Delhi, and in 1655 joined forces with him to attack Garhwal, which was under its king, Pirthi Sah, and subsequently captured the Terai region including Dehradun, which was hence separated from the Garhwal kingdom. Baz Bahadur extended his territory east to Karnali river. In 1672, Baz Bahadur started a poll tax, and its revenue was sent to Delhi as a tribute. Baz Bahadur also built the Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal,History of Nainital District The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 18, p. 324-325. after Lord Golu, a general in his army, who died valiantly at war.Chitai Temple He also built the Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal.Bhimtal British Library. Towards the end of 17th century, Chand Rajas again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688 Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwer and Parbateshwer, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Pabateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple.Almora Temples www.uttaranchal.org. Later, Jagat Chand (1708\u201320), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar, and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin.History of Garhwal District The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 12, p. 165-166. However, a subsequent king of Garhwal, Pradip Shah (1717\u201372), regained control over Garhwal and retained Doon till 1757, when Rohilla leader Najib-ul-Daula established himself there, though he was ousted soon by Pradip Shah. The Chand kings also defeated the Rajwars of Askot, though the latter were allowed to hold their land on the payment of a tribute.Askot The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 6, p. 14. The hill station of Binsar, 30 km from Almora was a summer retreat of the Chand kings.Almora Almora city official website. In the coming years, Jagat Chand\u2019s successor, Debi Chand (1720-6) took part in the wars of Rohillas of Rohilkhand, and was defeated by the British troops. ===Decline=== In 1744, Ali Mohammed Khan, the Rohilla leader, sent a force into the Chand territory and penetrated through Bhimtal in the Nainital district to Almora; the resistance of Chand army, under its ruler, Kalyan Chand, was weak and ineffective, and Almora fell to the Rohillas, who stayed here for seven short months, though they were ultimately driven out, an exit made possible by paying them a sum of three lakh rupees, and hastened by the harsh terrain of the region. This peace didn\u2019t last long as after just three months, unhappy over his lieutenants, Ali Mohammed Khan attacked again, though this time, he was stopped right at the entrance to the hills, at Barakheri, and defeated; and he made no further attempts to conquer the Kumaon kingdom, nor did the Muslim rulers of Delhi, and this remained the first and the last attack by Muslim rulers on the region. Reconciliation subsequently came into effected; troops from the hills, under Dip Chand, fought side by side with the Rohillas at Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. In 1760, he renamed the old Parbateshwer temple as Dipchandeshwar temple During British rule, then divisional commissioner of Kumaon, George William Trail, got the statue of the Nanda Devi, which had been relocated to the Udyot Chandeshwar temple, from the 'Malla Mahal' (Upper Court) of Chand kings, where the present collectorate exists, and in time, the temple started being called the \u2018Nanda Devi temple\u2019. The 'Talla Mahal' (Lower Court) of Chand rulers now houses the District Hospital.. Devi Temple Nanda Devi Temple website of Almora city. Due to internal strife, in the coming thirty years the kings lost most of the land they had previously ruled in the plains, and retained only the Bhabhar region. In early 1790, the Gurkhas invaded the Kumaon hills and Almora, under the leadership of Prithvi Narayan Shah; they advanced by crossing River Kali, through Gangoli; and the Chands, under the titular Chand Raja, were driven to the Bhabhar and finally expelled. The Terai and Kashipur were ceded to the British by the Nawab of Awadh in 1801, along with the rest of Rohilkhand. Nepalese rule lasted forCruel Gurkha Regime www.uttaranchal.org. twenty-four years. The end came because of their repeated intrusion into British territories in the Terai from 1800 onwards. Lord Moira, the Governor-General of India, decided to attack Almora in December 1814, marking the beginning of the Anglo-Nepalese War. After the war, the old Lal Mandi fort, near Almora (present cantonment), was renamed \u2018Fort Moira\u2019.Almora British Library. Harak Deo Joshi, the minister of the last Chand Raja,Chand Rajas in Kashipur took the side of the British, a force of 4500 men marched from Kashipur in February, 1815. Champawat was first taken in March from Pilibhit, through the Kali River. Within two months, a strong British army under Colonel Nichols attacked and captured Almora, on 26 April 1815.History of Almora District The Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909, v. 5, p. 245-246. A truce was called the same day, and with the ratification of Treaty of Sugauli on 4 March 1816, Kumaon and Garhwal became a part of the British Raj. ==List of Chand Kings== Badri Datt Pandey, in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas lists the Chand kings as following:Pandey(1993) pg197-332 {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;font-size: 11pt\" |- !width=\"150\" rowspan=\"1\"| King !rowspan=\"1\"|Reign !rowspan=\"1\"|Notes |- | Som Chand | 700-721 | |- | Atm Chand | 721-740 | |- | Purn Chand | 740-758 | |- | Indra Chand | 758-778 | Opened Silk Factories |- | Sansar Chand | 778-813 | |- | Sudha Chand | 813-833 | |- | Hamir Chand | 833-856 | |- | Vina Chand | 856-869 | Lost to Khas Kings |- | Vir Chand | 1065-1080 | |- | Rup Chand | 1080-1093 | |- | Laxmi Chand | 1093-1113 | |- | Dharm Chand | 1113-1121 | |- | Karm Chand | 1121-1140 | |- | Ballal Chand | 1140-1149 | |- | Nami Chand | 1149-1170 | |- | Nar Chand | 1170-1177 | |- | Nanaki Chand | 1177-1195 | |- | Ram Chand | 1195-1205 | |- | Bhishm Chand | 1205-1226 | |- | Megh Chand | 1226-1233 | |- | Dhyan Chand | 1233-1251 | |- | Parvat Chand | 1251-1261 | |- | Thor Chand | 1261-1275 | |- | Kalyan Chand II | 1275-1296 | |- | Trilok Chand | 1296-1303 | Conquered Chhakhata Built a fort at Bhimtal |- | Damaru Chand | 1303-1321 | |- | Dharm Chand | 1321-1344 | |- | Abhay Chand | 1344-1374 | |- | Garur Gyan Chand | 1374-1419 | Established authority over Bhabar and Terai; later lost them to nawab of Sambhal |- | Harihar Chand | 1419-1420 | |- | Udyan Chand | 1420-1421 | built Baleshwar Temple at Champawat Captured Chaugarkha |- | Atma Chand II | 1421-1422 | |- | Hari Chand II | 1422-1423 | |- | Vikram Chand | 1423-1437 | Completed Baleshwar Temple |- | Bharati Chand | 1437-1450 | Defeated Doti |- | Ratna Chand | 1450-1488 | Defeated Bams of Sor Defeated Doti again |- | Kirti Chand | 1488-1503 | annexed Barahmandal, Pali and Faldakot |- | Pratap Chand | 1503-1517 | |- | Tara Chand | 1517-1533 | |- | Manik Chand | 1533-1542 | |- | Kalyan Chand III | 1542-1551 | |- | Purna Chand | 1551-1555 | |- | Bhishm Chand | 1555-1560 | laid foundation stone of Alamnagar lost Barahmandal to Khas Sardar Gajuwathinga |- | Balo Kalyan Chand | 1560-1568 | recaptured Barahmandal moved capital to Alamnagar and renamed it Almora Annexed Mankot and Danpur |- | Rudra Chand | 1568-1597 | Successfully defended Terai from nawab of Kath and Gola founded the city of Rudrapur Annexed Sira |- | Laxmi Chand | 1597-1621 | built Laxmeswar and Bagnath Temple at Almora and Bageshwar respectively Invaded Garhwal 7 times without any Success |- | Dilip Chand | 1621-1624 | |- | Vijay Chand | 1624-1625 | |- | Trimal Chand | 1625-1638 | |- | Baz Bahadur Chand | 1638-1678 | Captured Dehradun |- | Udyot Chand | 1678-1698 | Defeated Garhwal and Doti |- | Gyan Chand | 1698-1708 | Defeated Garhwal and expelled fateh shah from Srinagar |- | Jagat Chand | 1708-1720 | Defeated Garhwal |- | Devi Chand | 1720-1726 | |- | Ajit Chand | 1726-1729 | |- | Kalyan Chand V | 1729-1747 | Defeated Rohillas |- | Deep Chand | 1747-1777 | |- | Mohan Chand | 1777-1779 | Defeated by King Lalit Shah of Garhwal |- | Pradyumn Chand | 1779-1786 | Son of king Lalit Shah of Garhwal |- | Mohan Chand | 1786-1788 | Overthrew Pradyumn Shah; Became king for second time |- | Shiv Chand | 1788 | |- | Mahendra Chand | 1788-1790 | Defeated by Gorkhas |} ==Legacy== The first capital of Chand rulers, Champawat, in the stronghold popularly known as Kali Kumaon, is now a district headquarters town, and hold many remnants of once powerful Chand reign, including a medieval fort, Baleshwar temple, Nagnath Temple, etc. Other temples of their reign are Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal, and Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal. ==See also== *Kumauni people ==References== ==Further reading== * History of Kumaun : English version of \"Kumaun ka itihas\". by B.
