    "text": "J1 World Tour () was the debut concert tour by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai (), in support of her fifth and sixth studio albums, Magic and Castle. It started on August 7, 2004, in Shanghai, China at Hongkou Football Stadium and continued throughout Asia and North America before concluding on April 22, 2006, in Irvine, United States at Bren Events Center. ==Background== Prior to the tour, Tsai's only live concerts were limited to one-off concerts in Taiwan. Following the success of the Magic (2003) and Castle (2004) albums, the record label wanted to spread the success of the album by sending Tsai on a concert tour. However, the tour was restricted within Asia and United States. It did not visit Europe or Oceania. Tsai was quite nervous to perform in front of a huge non-Taiwanese audience, and singing with a live band for the first time. ==Concert synopsis== A giant chandelier was lowered onstage to reveal Tsai on the top. As she took off her heavy white outerwear, she performed \"Prove It\". This was followed by her hits \"36 Tricks of Love\", \"It's Love\", and \"Disappearing Castle\". After Tsai finished the first segment and disappeared backstage, a giant shell was lifted onstage then revealed Tsai in a mermaid-look costume. After Tsai disappeared backstage, the backdrops displayed a kitty turning into Tsai. The third segment started with Tsai in a red kitty-look corset to sing \"Nice Cat\". Then she performed her classic love songs from her previous albums released by Universal, including \"Do You Still Love Me\", \"Can't Speak Clearly\", \"What Kind of Love\", and \"I Know You're Feeling Blue\". The last segment began with Tsai in a swordsman-look costume to perform \"The Spirit of Knight\". The show ended with Tsai performing her dance hit \"Magic\". ==Set list== ==Shows== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, and special guest |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Special guest(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;\" | Note |- ! colspan=\"6\" | Asia |- | align=\"left\" | 7 August 2004 |Shanghai | China | Hongkou Football Stadium | Jerry Yan Edison Chen | |- | align=\"left\" | 20 November 2004 | Taipei | Taiwan | Chungshan Soccer Stadium | Show Lo Jay Chou | |- | align=\"left\" | 4 December 2004 | Beijing | China | Workers Indoor Arena | Vanness Wu | |- | align=\"left\" | 11 December 2004 | colspan=\"2\"|Singapore | Singapore Indoor Stadium | Sylvester Sim Yida Huang | |- | align=\"left\" | 20 May 2005 | rowspan=\"2\" | Kuala Lumpur | rowspan=\"2\" | Malaysia | rowspan=\"2\" | Arena of Stars | rowspan=\"2\" | Show Lo | |- | align=\"left\" | 21 May 2005 | |- ! colspan=\"6\" | North America |- | align=\"left\" | 16 April 2006 | Atlantic City | rowspan=\"2\" | United States | Etess Arena | rowspan=\"2\" | Show Lo | |- | align=\"left\" | 22 April 2006 | Irvine | Bren Events Center | |} ==References== Category:Jolin Tsai concert tours Category:2004 concert tours Category:2005 concert tours Category:2006 concert tours ",
