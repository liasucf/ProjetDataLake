The website's critical consensus states, \"Charming, hilarious, and surprisingly sincere, Solar Opposites revels in the ridiculousness of life while finding a few fresh things to say about humanity along the way.\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club gave the show a B grade, and calls it \"a mischievous cousin of 3rd Rock from the Sun\" while saying it doesn't stray too far from the template Roiland set with Rick and Morty. McLevy feels the show is still finding its feet, but \"Luckily, the humor is so reliably strong, the pacing so breakneck as it races from one plot to the next, that it's hard not to be won over by Solar Opposites' avalanche of charm.\" Dan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote; \"The early episodes have certain limited windows of continuity or running gags... but the show becomes increasingly serialized; things that seem like they might be throw-away become unexpectedly important.\" Daniel Kurland of Bubbleblabber gave the show's first season a 9/10, stating, \"Solar Opposites doesn't hit the same sweeping places of nuance and reflection that Rick and Morty does, but it still respects its characters and takes their problems seriously. It's just easy to get lost in all of the free-floating chaos that never really gets a chance to slow down. Solar Opposites delivers an exceptional first season that's as good, if not even better than Rick and Morty in some ways. It's definitely a crazier series, which is a very good thing for the nature of animated comedies on television. If this is the baseline for Solar Opposites then future seasons can only get more ambitious and insane.\" ===Audience viewership=== According to Hulu, the series was the number 1 most watched show since its debut on May 8, 2020 to May 12, 2020. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:2020s American comic science fiction television series Category:2020s American sitcoms Category:American adult animated comic science fiction television series Category:American animated sitcoms Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Animated television series about extraterrestrial life Category:Animated television series about dysfunctional families Category:English-language television shows Category:Hulu original programming Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:Television series by Fox Television Animation Category:Television series by Justin Roiland's Solo Vanity Card Productions!
