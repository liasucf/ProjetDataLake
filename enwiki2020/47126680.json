    "text": "A Swimrun is a multiple-stage competition which involves participants running and swimming over a race course or loop-course that involves at least two transitions between the swim and run stages of the race. All equipment used by participants has to be carried all the way to the finish line. ==History== The first swimrun race was the Swedish \u00d6 till \u00f6 (stylized as \u00d6till\u00d6), a course across 26 islands. In 2002, Anders Malm, the owner of Ut\u00f6 V\u00e4rdshus (the finish line hotel of \u00d6till\u00d6), his friend Janne Lindberg and some of his staff (the Andersson brothers) had a late night in the bar. They challenged each other \u2013 \"Last team of two to Sandhamn pays for hotel, dinner and drinks\". Two teams of two started the next morning with the only rule being that they had to pass the three different restaurants on the islands between the start and the finish. The last team at the restaurant had to drink and pay what the team ahead of them had ordered for them. It took them more than 24 hours and they were too tired to party on arrival. They tried again the year after with the same result. They're referred to as Original 4. In 2006, Michael Lemmel and Mats Skott were asked if they could make a commercial race out of their crazy challenge. The first couple of years only 11 teams started and only two managed to finish within the time limits. They was: Petri Forsman, Ville Niemel\u00e4 and Johan Hasselmark, Martin Sahlen ref). Then something happened and the teams learned that the only way to race is by not stopping, with constant movement. Unlike the original course set by the creators, Ut\u00f6 became the finish line while Sandhamn became the start. The race became known as \u00d6till\u00d6 (Island to island), Today the race is internationally recognized as the Swimrun World Championship for \u00d6till\u00d6 and has been ranked by CNN as one of the toughest races in the World. It was also later mentioned by one article as one of the toughest 1-day endurance races in the world, and is currently the standard when it comes to rules and style of racing. In 2011 the style of racing picked up the name \"Swimrun\", given by Erika Rosenbaum, one of the \u00d6till\u00d6 Swimrun World Championship podium finishers. In 2012 was the race with more than nine (3man/3woman/3mix) finisher teams and the years of the consolidation of the race ref. In 2014 on August 3, the first swimrun race done in warm water Results was Aquaticrunner XTriM ITALY and it started . It is an individual swimrun race and not a standard dual-team race such as in \u00d6till\u00d6. The biggest different between Aquaticrunner and the Nordic races are two: the Individual/Solo race (no team) and that swimming tools are not permitted (no fins, snorkel, etc.) with the exception that a pull buoy is allowed (Paddle starting from 2017). The Other races done outside of Sweden in 2014 was: Rockman Swimrun and XTERRA Swimrun (stapped in 2016) both in Norway, Engandina in Switzerland and Amphibianman in Italy (this was the first outside of Sweden done on May 10, 2014). Aquaticrunner 2014 was also the first Individual/Solo Swimrun done in the world and it was realized by Matteo Benedetti. In 2014, the organisation World of Swimrun / Worldofswimrun (WoS) was formed (***) [needs 2014 Constitutional meeting]. World of Swimrun is a neutral, independent and global non-profit organisation: By swimrunners - for swimrunners, with a mission to bring swimrun to everybody and provide the latest swimrun news. World of swimrun also hosts the biggest data source on available and active races in the world. (***) Please indicate the link of the Constitutional meeting or something to official of WoS foundation, Facebook is not something to consider official In 2015, the world's first Ultraswimrun, the Stockholm Archipelago Ultra Challenge (SAUC) took place, and is considered the current (2019) toughest available swimrun race challenge in the world, stretching over some 250 km. SAUC is also the official Ultraswimrun open challenge. In 2015 the swimrun started in Russia with Individual and Team forums. In 2015, the World Swimrun Federation was founded in Switzerland Constitutional meeting (Canton Ticino Switzerland - official language: Italian). The objective of WSRF is to discipline, organize, promote, advance and spread out the sport of Swimrun throughout the wide world in Individual/solo and Team formula. The scope is to promote and develop swimrun sport in the world in accordance with the principles set out by the Olympic Charter and in protection of physical and mental health of athletes, fighting doping in all its forms. The organisation is independent and global non- profit. In 2016, SwimRun Australia became the first SwimRun not only in Australia but also the southern hemisphere, bathing the way for the growth of SwimRun in the Asia-Pacific region . Most swimrun races are completed in teams of two. Starting from 2016, there are some individual/solo swimrun in the world: starting from Italy (Italian Swimrun series 12 race swimrun italy), now 17 race,http://www.swimrun.it/race-schedule-2019/ Love Swimrun, Canarie Swimrun and Portugal Swimrun, in Individual and Team forums. In 2017, In France, swimrun is linked to the FFTRi, as it is in Finland. Others individual/solo swimrun on 2017 was Canada Canaqua Swimrun and Uruguay Swimrun. In Africa, Torpedo SwimRun held the first swimrun race on the continent in Cape Town on January 15, 2017. The race covers 16 km of Cape Town coastline, with swims in the South Atlantic and running at the base of Table Mountain. In Japan, Kaiyo SwimRun held the first swimrun race in Asia on May 27, 2017. In 2018, the world's first book on swimrun was published Swimrun \u2013 The Guide to Swimrun Training & Racing, Stockholm, Sweden (2018).In 2018 Aquaticrunner was the first individual World Championship with 22 nations represented and 250 athletes qualified. The world qualified was done in Fuerteventura, Madeira, Canada, Russa, Uruguay, Belgin, and Italy. In Japan, a new swimrun race, called Marunuma Swimrun held which contained regular and sprint distance. The international focus has been growing in the last years, and on December 28, 2018 there are more than 500 known races in the world, in 24 countries and on 5 continents. In 2018, Ultra Swimrun ALPS consisted in a run, swim D+, passing through to the alpine lakes and is the swimrun race with the maximum total elevation. In 2019, SwimRun U.S. Series Ignite Swimrun became the first SwimRun series in the United States of America with 5 races using the individual/solo formula. Swimrun debuted on March 30, 2019 in Brazil and became the first race in tropical countries. B\u00fazios SwimRun changed to Hero SwimRun in honor of the effort of the athletes. With 200 athletes, the distances were (solo / teams) and (teams) in 7 different terrains and 17 beaches. The event also carried out environmental actions before the race, collecting of garbage in partnership with the Swedish Embassy in Brazil and with the local government. ==Swimrun characteristics== What defines a swimrun is that its always carried out outdoors and in water where the goal is to go from a starting point to a finish point through a course with at least 2 swim and run sections. All the equipment that a participant starts with has to be carried all the way to the finish line, meaning swimming needs to be done with shoes. Even though swimrun urges participants to use flotation equipment, equipment larger than 100\u00d760 cm is not allowed. Swimming with shoes makes the kick fairly inefficient and breaststroke not so suitable. The flotation equipment keeps the legs at surface meaning a good crawl position can be maintained without kick. Because of safety measures a swimrun competition is usually carried out by teams but there are several races where you can race individually. There are three classes to compete in; either a men's class, women's class or a mixed gender class. Given that swimrun is a cross-country race, there are no standards yet in terms of how far the total run and swim should be, or how many transitions there should be in a swimrun competition, like there is in sports related to swimrun such as aquathlon, biathle or triathlon. A difference to aquathlon is that swimrun has at least two swim legs and all equipment shall be carried all the way. While aquathlon like triathlon has one swim leg and a transition station where shoes and run clothes can be put on and wet suit be left. == Distances == The race levels vary in the world. There are no set race limits or race standards apart from having to compete in twos and as to what is constituted as a swimrun race. Currently the majority of races (2018) are spread among the following levels below (1st table). The world standard swimrun distances are divided into 6 types, in accordance with the majority of available races including \u00d6till\u00d6. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Standard swimrun distances - 2006\u20132018 |- !Level !Race distance |- |Super Sprint |<=10 km |- |Sprint |>10.1 & <=20 km |- |Regular |> 20.1 & <=40 km |- |Long |>40.1 & <=75 km |- |Ultra | +75 km |- |Multiday |>24 hours |} In Italy foremost, and few other European countries, a different distance scheme is used. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Individual swimrun distances - 2014\u20132018 |- !Level !From !To !Race distance |- |Short |1/4/4 |2/7/n |<=5k |- |Basic |2/8/4 |3/11/n |> 5.1 & <=10k |- |Half |4/17/8 |7/29/n |> 10.1 & <=21k |- |Full |8/34/14 |12/35/n |> 21.1 & <=42k |- |Long |8/34/14 |12/35/n |> 42.1 & <=75k |- |Ultra |10/65/20 |No limits |>=75.1k |} In France on 2017, the FFTri, defined the national standard distances. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |France classification distance since 2017 |- !Level !From !To |- |Distance XS | |<5k |- |Distance S |>5k |<12,5k |- |Distance M |>12,5k |<20k |- |Distance L |>20k |<35k |- |Distance XL |>35k |<55k |- |Distance XXL |>55k |No limits |} Considering that since 2018 many organizers propose both formula (team and individual), this is merge of the two distance table {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Merge between team and individual distance since 2019 |- !Level !From !To !Race distance |- |Super Sprint |1/4/4 |2/8/n |<=10k |- |Sprint or Short |2/8/6 |4/17/n |> 10 & <=21k |- |Half |4/17/8 |8/34/n |> 21 & <=42k |- |Long |8/34/10 |10/65/n |> 42 & <=75k |- |Ultra |10/65/20 |No limits |> 75k |- |muli-day |more of one day |No limits/4 |> 24 HOURS |} == The races == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
