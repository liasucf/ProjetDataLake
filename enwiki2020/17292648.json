    "text": "The Times-Union was a daily evening newspaper in the greater Rochester, New York, area for 79 years. It was published as an afternoon daily counterpart to the morning Democrat and Chronicle under the ownership of Gannett when it ceased operations in 1997. In that year the paper merged with the Democrat and Chronicle, with which it had shared a staff since 1992. The Rochester Advertiser began in 1826 with publisher Luther Tucker. It was acquired by the Rochester Union which was bought by Frank Gannett. In 1918 Gannett merged it with Evening Times to form the Times-Union. Ten years later Gannett purchased the 100-year-old Democrat and Chronicle, the paper with which the Times would ultimately merge. From 1918 until 1960 the paper was known as the Rochester Times-Union, from 1960 until 1980 it was known as The Times-Union then finally just the Times-Union from 1980 until the paper's demise in 1997. The Times- Union was for most of its existence from 1928 until 1997 was based out of the Gannett Building at 55 Exchange Boulevard which was also until 1985 the headquarters for Gannett and USA Today. The building although it was later shared with the sister Democrat and Chronicle who moved into the building in 1959 it was originally built for the Gannett and the Times-Union and still features an interlocking TU over the front door. ==Awards== The paper won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the 1971 Attica Prison riots. ==References== Category:Defunct newspapers published in New York (state) Category:Newspapers published in Rochester, New York Category:Pulitzer Prize-winning newspapers Category:1918 establishments in New York (state) Category:1997 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Daily newspapers published in New York (state) ",
