    "text": ", often shortened to , is a Japanese comedy manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Akimoto. It takes place in the present day, in and around a neighborhood police station (k\u014dban) in the downtown part of Tokyo, and revolves around the misadventures of middle-aged cop Kankichi Ryotsu. The official English title is KochiKame: Tokyo Beat Cops. It was continuously serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for 40 years, from September 1976 to September 2016. Its 1,960 chapters were collected into 200 tank\u014dbon volumes, making it the second manga series with the highest number of volumes. The manga has been adapted into an anime television series, produced by Studio Gallop and broadcast in Japan by Fuji TV, three theatrical animated films (by Tatsunoko and Gallop, respectively), two live-action movies, several stage adaptations, and a live-action television series. In addition, a short anime featuring characters from the series was produced to popularize the Paralympic sport of goalball, ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics of 2020 (now to be held in 2021). As of 2014, the series had sold over 157million tank\u014dbon copies, making KochiKame one of the best-selling manga series in history. In 2005, TV Asahi named the anime number 36 on its list of the Top 100 Anime. The series was awarded a Guinness World Record for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\" ==Plot== The typical KochiKame plot involves Kankichi \"Ryo-san\" Ryotsu coming up with a money-making scheme by inventing a new gadget or capitalizing on a fad, achieving great success, calling on Keiichi Nakagawa's help as things turn sour, and finally losing it all as the fad runs out of steam or out of control. While the plots are gag-driven, much of the humor comes from the combination of mundane characters with those that are bizarrely out of place; such as Nakagawa who has wealth and Ai Asato who is a transsexual. What they have in common is everyone's lack of actual police work, most of which is never explained or rationalized in the slightest. (It is explained in Jump that Ryo-san is one of the best officers at catching criminals.) Nakagawa and Reiko Akimoto have special licenses (such as for wearing personal clothes instead of uniforms to work) from police headquarters because of their skills in linguistics. The plot consistently evolved with the times and most of the main characters do not really age, despite the fact that the series started in the 1970s and is later clearly set in the 2010s. However, some characters do age, like the grandchild of Buchao, who was a baby in the early books, but is now close to junior high, which the author has self-mocked in a few \"look back\" episodes. KochiKame has a broad audience, ranging from adolescent boys to middle-aged salarymen. Ryo-san's antics appeal to children who can laugh at an old buffoon, and to men fearing that they are becoming old buffoons themselves\u2014and also because it often subtly mocks the latest fads and trends. The stories are generally innocent in content, and what little violence appears is comical, while the occasional risqu\u00e9 subjects are included strictly for laughs rather than to titillate. KochiKames immense popularity has led to guest appearances in the strip by real-life Japanese celebrities such as Tetsuya Komuro. For creator Osamu Akimoto, KochiKame is an homage to the working-class people and districts of old Tokyo, and most episodes open with an elaborate full-page illustration of a Shitamachi (downtown) street scene, typically with old wooden buildings and boys playing in the streets. ==Media== ===Manga=== Written and illustrated by Osamu Akimoto, Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den Mae Hashutsujo was continuously serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump since September 21, 1976.http://www.j-kochikame.com/arigatou/ Akimoto debuted the series under the pen name of \"Tatsuhiko Yamadome\", but changed to using his real name in 1978, when it reached its 100th chapter. Periodically the chapters were collected into tank\u014dbon volumes by publisher Shueisha, the first released on July 9, 1977. The series ended on September 17, 2016 in the 42nd issue of the year, in commemoration of KochiKames 40th anniversary. Its 200th and final tank\u014dbon volume was published on the same day. Shueisha reprinted the issue that included the final chapter on December 31, 2016, marking the first time a Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump issue has ever been reprinted. Akimoto created a new chapter of Kochikame for the 42nd issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump on September 16, 2017. From March 2017 to June 2019, Akimoto serialized a sequel in the seinen magazine Ultra Jump. Titled , it is set in a sent\u014d next to a police station in Shitamachi, Tokyo. ===Anime=== Since KochiKame's inception in Jump in 1976, the series was not adapted into anime often, most likely because it would have been more suited for a live-action adaptation. The closest it could get when being adapted into anime was either in the form of commercials for certain products sold in Japan such as toys and snack foods as early as 1980, and a 30-minute animated film produced by Tatsunoko Production which was shown alongside an animated adaptation of Izumi Matsumoto's Kimagure Orange Road (another popular Jump manga from 1984) produced by Studio Pierrot at a Shonen Jump Anime Festival hosted by Shueisha in 1985. It was directed by Hiroshi Sasagawa, who, at the time, was renowned for his directorial work on Tatsunoko's other works such as Speed Racer and the Time Bokan franchise. It was issued on home video by Shueisha under the Jump Video imprint as a prize for winners of a contest that took place in several issues of Weekly Shonen Jump for the magazine's 20th anniversary in 1988. However, to this day only small images of footage from the film can be seen on the internet since the film was not released broadly. An anime television adaptation of KochiKame finally began airing on Fuji Television on June 16, 1996. Produced by Studio Gallop, it ran for eight years and 382 episodes before ending on December 19, 2004. Two animated theatrical films were also produced; on December 23, 1999, and on December 20, 2003. On September 18, 2016, an hour-long special by Studio Gallop aired on Fuji TV for the manga's 40th anniversary. features several voice actors reprising their roles from the previous series, as well as director Akira Shigeno. In 2006, a dubbed Hindi version of KochiKame began airing on Hungama TV in India. ===Live-action=== KochiKame has also had live- action film, a TV drama and stage adaptations. The movie was directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi, starred Mitsuo Senda as Ryo-san and was released in 1977. A live-action TV series starring Katori Shingo as Ryo-san began airing on TBS on August 1, 2009. A second live-action movie, based on this TV series and titled KochiKame - The Movie: Save The Kachidiki Bridge!, opened in Japan on August 6, 2011. Another play adaptation opened in September 2016 for the series' 40th anniversary and, like the others, it was directed, written by and stars Lasar Ishii as Ryo-san, who is also the voice actor for the character in anime adaptations. ===Other media=== As part of its 40th anniversary celebration, the series received a 6-part crossover anthology novel with various characters from other series on September 17, 2016. Titled , the other series are Girls und Panzer, Osomatsu-san, Haruchika, Cheer Boys!!, Sorcerous Stabber Orphen and Nazotoki wa Dinner no Ato de. Ryotsu appears playable in the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump crossover fighting video games Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and J-Stars Victory VS. Other characters from the series appear in a non-playable capacity. J-Stars Victory VS.'s North American and European release (as J-Stars Victory VS.+) marks the first official release of Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den-mae Hashutsujo material in English-speaking territories. In addition, various toys and collectibles have been created, including some items that first appeared in the manga as creations of Ryo-san. ==Real-life KochiKame== The real neighborhood police station on which the manga one is based. Kameari Koen is an actual park in Tokyo's Katsushika ward. The police station is fictional, but it is modeled after a real one located on the north side of Kameari railway station. The manga has brought considerable fame to the neighborhood, and it draws sightseers from all over Japan to a (usually vacant) station in a nondescript residential neighborhood. There is only a vacant lot where the police station is actually supposed to be located. In February 2006, two life-size bronze statues of Ryo-san were erected at the north and south gates of Kameari Station. There is currently a trail of 14 statues in the area. ==30th anniversary== In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den Mae Hashutsujo's serialization, several special events were held. Separate one-shots of the series were published in thirteen different Shueisha magazines between August and October 2006. ==Reception== As of 2014, Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K\u014den-mae Hashutsujo had sold over 157million tank\u014dbon copies, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history.
