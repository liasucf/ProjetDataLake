On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of P\u00e9ry and La Heutte merged to form the new municipality of P\u00e9ry-La Heutte.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 ==History== La Heutte was first mentioned in 1393 as H\u00fctte. It was first called by the current name in 1727. A glass-hut or glassworks was mentioned in the area as part of a fief of the d'Orsans family in 1370. While a village was not mentioned then, by 1393 a village had grown around the glassworks. It was part of the seigniory of Erguel in the Diocese of Basel. It was part of the parish of P\u00e9ry. So La Heutte adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1530, when Biel converted the entire parish of P\u00e9ry to the new faith. During the 18th century, Biel attempted to expand its power, which caused frequent conflicts with the neighboring villages, including La Heutte. The first glass factory, at Le Van north of the village, dates from before 1370. Another glass factory opened in the valley at the end of the 15th century and remained in operation until the early 17th century. Between 1650 and 1750 the village expanded toward the Suze river as the population grew. A thriving pottery industry and a large mill developed along the river. The first school was built in the 1839. In 1876 a train station was built in the village, which encouraged the growth of the watch industry. Two years later, the Ammann watch factory opened in the old Bendit mill. In 1895 the Urania Watch Company replaced Ammann in the mill. It was, in turn, replaced by the Weber wire drawing factory in 1938. During a watchmaking boom between 1950 and 1974, numerous small watch and watch part workshops opened in the village. The A16 motorway connected La Heutte with Biel in 1985, transforming the village into a bedroom community. In 1995 about a dozen tracks of three-toed dinosaurs were discovered in the municipality. ==Geography== Suze river at La Heutte La Heutte is located in the lower part of Vallon de Saint-Imier, from the town of Biel/Bienne.
