    "text": "\"All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande\" is a Mexican song. It was written in the 1920s for a musical theatrical work, but now is most commonly associated with the eponymous 1936 Mexican motion picture All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande, in which it was sung by renowned actor and singer Tito Gu\u00edzar and with mariachis. Bing Crosby recorded the song on April 3, 1939 as \"El Rancho Grande\" and it reached the No. 6 spot in the charts during a ten-week stay in 1939. Crosby recorded the song again in 1954 for the album Bing: A Musical Autobiography. The song was featured in the film Mexicali Rose (1939) starring Gene Autry. Autry also made a commercial recording of the song. Others to record the song are Al Bowlly (as \"Give Me My Ranch\"), Artie Shaw and Dean Martin (on his Dino Latino album). In 1958 the song was covered by Rex Allen on his album Mister Cowboy on the Decca record label. Elvis Presley sang the song when playing around at the rehearsals for the documentary film That's the Way It Is (on Wednesday, July 15, 1970). His performance was recorded and, in 1995, released by BMG on the box set Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential '70s Masters. == Musical style == The song is a typical ranchera, with mariachi choruses and lyrics dealing with life in a traditional Mexican ranch.
