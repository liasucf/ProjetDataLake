    "text": "Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels is a 17th-century painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's Italian art collection by the Flemish Baroque painter David Teniers the Younger, now held in the Schleissheim Palace.Interieur van het schilderijenkabinet van aartshertog Leopold te Brussel met de Italiaanse schilderijen, na 1656 in the RKD The painting shows the Archduke as a collector pointing with his cane towards a few paintings propped against each other on the floor. Behind him is the artist wearing a gold chain and sword, the attributes of honor for his role as gallery director for the archduke. Above the door is a portrait of another patron of the artist, King Philip IV of Spain, and behind the large paintings on the right is a bust on a pedestal of Queen Christina of Sweden. On the left behind the table is an assistant holding a print. The table foot has been documented as a creation of the sculptor Adriaen de Vries depicting Ganymede. The paintings are arranged in rows on the walls, and is one of the paintings that David Teniers the Younger prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his Theatrum Pictorium, considered the \"first illustrated art catalog\". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.Online version of the Theatrum Pictorium, 1673 In her catalog raisonn\u00e9 of Teniers' works, Margret Klinge dates this painting after 1654 because in the similar gallery painting dated 1653 his portrait does not show the keys, chain, and sword that he is shown wearing in the portrait by Philips Fruytiers dated 1655. Furthermore, the painting of The Three Philosophers and several other Italian paintings are painted in mirror image, which may indicate that he was working from his miniature copy rather than the original, which would have been a necessity after the Archduke left Brussels with his collection to return to Vienna in 1656. ==List of paintings depicted== The following is a list of the recognizable paintings of the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, which was a selection of 243 of the most prized paintings out of a collection of 1300-1400 pieces. Many are still in the Viennese collection. Here is a list of the paintings depicted, which starts with the paintings at the top left, running from left to right and from top to bottom and continuing in the same way with the rear wall on the right. {| class='wikitable sortable' style='width:100%' !image !article !painter !year !collection !inventory nr. !catalog code |- | 128px | The Three Philosophers | Giorgione | 1500s | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_111 | 20 |- | 128px | Man with Ermine Coat | Titian | 1560 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_76 | 95 |- | 128px | Portrait of Jacopo Strada | Titian | 1567 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_81 | 92 |- | 128px | Judith with the head of Holofernes | Carlo Saraceni | 1613 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_41 | 39 |- | 128px | Christ carrying the cross meets Veronica | Jacopo Bassano | | | | 144 |- | 128px | Dead Christ Supported by an Angel | Palma il Giovane | 1612 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_9394 | 179 |- | 128px | Aeneas Takes Leave of Dido | Andrea Schiavone | 1555 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_5818 | 135 |- | 128px | King Philip IV of Spain | unknown | 1653 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_324 | |- | 128px | Lady with an Ermine | Titian | | | | 94 |- | 128px | Portrait of a Man with Beret | anonymous | 1538 | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_1552 | 56 |- | 128px | Portrait of a White-Bearded Man | Tintoretto | | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_25 | 103 |- | 128px | Portrait of Francesco Donato, Doge of Venice | anonymous | | Kunsthistorisches Museum | GG_3062 | 98 |- | 128px | The Orator Giovan Pietro Maffeis (?)
