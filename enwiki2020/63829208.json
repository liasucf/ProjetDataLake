Bryce's The Laws of Life and Health was described in a review by the Journal of the American Medical Association as \"one that the physician can conscientiously recommend to his patients because of the sterling common sense which characterizes it and the absence of \"fads\" and \"notions.\" A review by the British Medical Journal stated that medical practitioners and the public would profit from reading the book but suggested that some of his advice was impractical such as his condemnation of drinking at meals. The work was popular and went through several editions. His Modern Theories of Diet examined various diets and fad diets. It was positively reviewed.
