    "text": "\"I Need a Miracle\" is a single released by British singer-songwriter Tara McDonald in 2016. It was chosen as the Europride anthem for 2016 remixed by Gregor Salto. The single charted at No. 83 in Portugal and No. 47 in France. It is a cover of the song originally recorded by Coco Star released on Green Light Recordings, which was re-released as a mashup/remix by Fragma called \"Toca's Miracle\". It was co-written by Rob Davis and Victor Imbres. McDonald's version of the song is produced in a tropical dance style and the BPM for this cover version is slower than the original. One line repeated often in this version is \"I won't take nothing less than a deeper love\", which McDonald felt was the message of the song she wanted to share.http://www.myguide2stockholm.com/music-tara-mcdonald-releases-iconic-i- need-a-miracle/ ==Background== McDonald decided to record \"I Need a Miracle\" in 2015 after performing at the Bataclan to raise money for that year's Paris Pride, three months prior to the terrorist attack. The attack at Bataclan affected her deeply as people she worked with during her performance at the venue that were killed in the attack as well as staff from her record company Mercury/Universal France. She wanted to release a record about a deeper love and this song fitted that message perfectly. ==Use in popular culture== The song was chosen as the Europride anthem for 2016 with a special remix by Gregor Salto. The Europride event was held in Amsterdam, which led to McDonald appearing on many televised concerts performing the record. Gregor Salto created a remix for the event, which was only used for promotion and not included in the official remix package. In 2016, \"I Need a Miracle\" (Andros Remix) was used on the official soundtrack for a British film set in Ibiza titled White Island, starring Billy Zane and UK singer/rapper Example. It is used in a scene shot at the Ocean Beach club. ==Philanthropy== On 22nd May 2020 McDonald released an updated version of \"I Need A Miracle\" donating 100% of her royalties to the children's charity UNICEF during lockdown to raise money for children affected by covid-19. https://actuanews.fr/Tara-McDonald- revisite-I-need-a-miracle-pour-l-Unicef_a46952.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWCvuBuqLmk https://www.monopoli.gr/2020/05/25/promotional-items/music-promo- items/391865/i-need-a-miracle-to-neo-tragoudi-tis-tara-mcdonald-se-synergasia- me-tin-unicef/ ==Live performances== Tara McDonald's first televised performance of \"I Need a Miracle\" was at the charity event The Teleton, in Guayaquil, Ecuador in December 2015, a TV show shown nationwide in Ecuador and across Latin America.
