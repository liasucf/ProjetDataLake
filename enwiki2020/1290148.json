    "text": "The People's Political Party (PPP) was Jamaica's first modern political party. Formed in September 1929 by Marcus Garvey, the PPP set out a 14 point manifesto\u2014the first of its kind in the island's electoral history. The points contained in the PPP's manifesto were far-reaching and perceptive as illustrated by a few of them, such as: * An eight-hour work day * A minimum wage * A larger share of self-government * Protection for native industries * A legal aid department for the poor * Technical schools for each parish * Land reform * Libraries and civic improvement for parish capitals * City status for Montego Bay and Port Antonio * A National Park at the Kingston Race Course The PPP contested the 1962 elections, receiving 0.9% of the vote and failing to win a seat.Nohlen, Dieter (2005). Elections in the Americas: A Data Handbook, Volume I. p. 433-435 The party did not contest any further elections.Nohlen, p. 432. == References == Category:History of the Colony of Jamaica Category:Defunct political parties in Jamaica Category:Political parties established in 1929 ",
