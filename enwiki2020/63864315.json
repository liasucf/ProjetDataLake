Biography @ JerezSiempre == Biography == His father was employed by a winery. He was attracted to drawing and painting at an early age. He and his friend, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Barbudo, who shared his interests, frequently visited the studios of Luis Sevil (1817-1893), a local still-life painter. After learning as much as he could in Jerez, he left for Madrid in 1873 with the support of his father's employer, Guillermo Garvey (1834-?). There, he enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. At his father's prompting, he initially studied architecture, but soon switched to painting and became a student of Federico de Madrazo. Later, he developed an interest in Orientalist painting; travelling throughout North Africa. In 1878, his painting \"Arab Wedding\" was bought by the government. Urged on by Garvey, he used some of the money he received to continue his studies in Italy. By 1880, he had decided to settle in Rome. \"Gallegos, pintor y escultor jerezano\" In: Diario de Jerez, 2018 He continued to travel, however, visiting Munich, London, Paris and Berlin, as well taking an occasional trip home. His paintings sold well and he was able to enlist the Van Baerle brothers, of the Netherlands, as his agents. His works were also sold by Arthur Tooth & Sons in London. In 1887, he married Giuseppina Trelanzi, of Milan. They had four children, including the architect, . She died in 1897. Three years later, he married Constance Harding, the daughter of an English clergyman, whom he had met while she was vacationing in Italy with her mother. She was twenty-three years younger than him and they had five children. He was awarded a gold medal at the International Exposition of Fine Arts (1891) in Berlin. His paintings may be seen at museums in Germany, Russia, and throughout North America. One was owned by William Randolph Hearst. Few of his paintings are in Italy, as he rarely exhibited there; possibly out of concern for creating jealousy among the other Spanish-born artists, of which there were many. He spent every summer at a rented villa in Nettuno, near Anzio, where he painted en plein aire and hunted. One day, he was out hunting wild boar, when he fell from a tree and injured his spine. As he was recovering, he died from a stroke while watching a Corpus Christi procession. His death came less than twelve hours after the death of his eldest son, Lucas. They were buried together in Nettuno. ==Selected paintings== File:Gallegos-Arabs.jpg|Arabs Meditating File:Gallegos-Church.jpg|In the Church File:\u0413\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0410\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0430.jpg|Playing Chess File:Gallegos-Dowry.jpg|The Bride's Dowry == References == == External links == * Gallegos y Arnosa website Homepage * More works by Gallegos @ ArtNet Category:1857 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Spanish painters Category:Spanish genre painters Category:Spanish orientalists Category:Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando alumni Category:People from Jerez de la Frontera Category:Spanish emigrants to Italy ",
