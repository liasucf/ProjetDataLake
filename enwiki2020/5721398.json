    "text": "The Texas scarlet snake (Cemophora lineri ) is a species of nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. The species is endemic to the South Central United States. It was previously considered a subspecies of Cemophora coccinea. ==Etymology== The specific name or epithet, lineri, is in honor of American herpetologist Ernest A. Liner (1925\u20132010), who collected the first specimen in 1963.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America \u2013 Explained. Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cemophora coccinea lineri, p. 159). ==Geographic range== C. lineri is found in southern Texas. Its range does not overlap with the other species of scarlet snake.Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT (2016). Peterson Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Fourth Edition. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. xiv + 494 pp., 47 plates, 207 figures. . (Cemophora coccinea lineri, pp. 367-368 + Plates 32, 44 + Figure 159 on p. 330). ==Description== The Texas scarlet snake is the larger of the two scarlet snake species, and is capable of growing to a total length (including tail) of 66 cm (26 inches). It has a gray or white background color, with distinct red blotches that have black borders. Unlike the other species, the black borders do not join on the sides. Its belly is a solid white or gray. ==Behavior== Like all scarlet snakes (genus Cemophora), the Texas scarlet snake is a secretive burrower, spending most of its time under ground. It prefers sandy thicket habitats along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. ==Diet== The preferred diet of C. lineri is the eggs of other reptiles, but it will also eat small rodents and lizards. ==References== ==External links== * ==Further reading== *Behler JL, King FW (1979).
