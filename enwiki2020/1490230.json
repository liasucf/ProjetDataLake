    "text": "Carlton breweries in 1886 Carlton & United Breweries is an Australian brewing company based in Melbourne. In 1983 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elders IXL and CUB was delisted. In 1990, Elders IXL was renamed as Foster's Group, and in July 2004, CUB changed its name to Carlton & United Beverages.History of Carlton & United Breweries, AustralianBeers.com. Accessed 2009-10-10. In February 2009, Foster's announced the decision to separate the Australian Wine division from the Australian Beer, Cider & Spirits (BCS) division, and rename BCS to Carlton & United Breweries. CUB produces many of Australia's most successful beverages, including one of Australia's highest selling beers, Victoria Bitter.\"VB regains crown as nation's favourite beer\" In December 2011, SABMiller acquired Foster's Group, and took over ownership of Carlton & United Breweries as part of the acquisition. Subsequently in October 2016, CUB was included in the purchase of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev. SABMiller ceased trading on global stock markets and as a result, Carlton & United was then owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. In July 2019, Asahi Breweries agreed terms to purchase Carlton & United Breweries with the Foreign Investment Review Board approving the deal in May 2020. ==History== Carlton Dry Bottle The history of Carlton & United Breweries / Beverages or CUB began when Carlton, Fosters, Victoria, Shamrock, Castlemaine and McCracken breweries formed into a cartel known as the Society of Melbourne Brewers in 1903. Emil Resch played a significant role in enabling the amalgamation. Resch also went on to become the first general manager of CUB.Moloney, John. (1987) The Penguin bicentennial history of Australia: The story of 200 years, New York: The Viking Press, p. 219.G. P. Walsh. (1988) 'Resch, Emil Karl (1860 - 1930)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 11, Melbourne University Press, pp. 365-366. The merge allowed CUB to raise prices and remain profitable in what had been an unprofitable market. In 1907 this group merged into a single company known as the Carlton & United Breweries. The company became public in 1913 with the issue of 100,000 shares. Over time it has bought out many other brewers, such as Abbotsford Co-operative Brewery in 1924 (a company set up by independent hoteliers to combat the anti-competitive nature of the Society of Melbourne Brewers.) Their first interstate acquisition was Northern Australian Breweries and the Cairns Brewery in 1931. Further acquisitions were the Ballarat Brewing Company, Queensland Brewery Ltd, Thos McLauchlin & Co Pty Ltd, Richmond Brewery and Tooth & Co. In 1983, CUB was wholly bought by Elders IXL, a giant Australian diversified conglomerate with pastoral, financial, materials, and food interests. Elders Brewing Group (as it then became known as) continued to acquire brewing companies in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In 1990 Elders Brewing Group changed its name to Foster's Group, to reflect the name of their most internationally recognised product. In July 2004, Carlton & United Breweries changed its name to Carlton & United Beverages (retaining CUB acronym), citing the company's diversification into pre-mixed drinks, juices, ciders and non-alcoholic drinks. In February 2009, Foster's announced the outcomes of a review of its global wine business, including the decision to separate the Australian Wine division from the Australian Beer, Cider & Spirits (BCS) division, and rename BCS to Carlton & United Breweries.Foster's announces the outcomes from its wine review, ASX announcement 17 February 2009, Media Centre, fosters.com.au. Accessed 2009-10-10. In mid-June 2016 CUB made the controversial decision to lay off 55 workers (mostly electricians and fitters) before inviting those same workers to reapply for their old jobs on individual contracts involving stripped conditions, clauses and significant pay cuts (the workers are suggesting a 65 per cent wage cut once penalty rates and other entitlements are factored in).http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/staff-picket-cub- factory-as-sackings-stall-production-20160712-gq3zsx.html SABMiller, CUB's global owner, responded to criticisms from the union movement that its action was not illegal as it has no direct contractual relationship with the maintenance crews that were laid off. Rather, it has a contractual relationship with one subcontractor and the action constitutes the \"passing\" of a contract to another, which has the prerogative to set pay and conditions of workers at its own discretion. SABMiller have made no comment regarding the lower pay and poorer conditions offered to workers. Carlton Draught (bottle 375mL) The decision generated considerable poor publicity for CUB, with a widespread social media campaign as well as union efforts to highlight the workers' plight, who argue the brewer has conducted a \"transmission of business\"https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd163.pdf manoeuvre. Several pubs in Victoria have stopped selling CUB products in support of the sacked workers. In July 2019, Asahi Breweries agreed terms to purchase Carlton & United Breweries with the transaction completed in May 2020 after being cleared by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission and Foreign Investment Review Board.Asahi Group Holdings - Carlton & United Breweries (owned by Anheuser Busch InBev SA/NV) Australian Competition & Consumer Commission 1 April 2020 ==Products== After the takeovers by SABMiller and then Anheuser-Busch InBev, CUB distributed their international brands such as Aguila, Corona Extra, Stella Artois, Beck's, Budweiser, Hoegaarden, Leffe and Leffe Radieuse. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
