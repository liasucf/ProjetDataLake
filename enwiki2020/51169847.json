    "text": "Stephen Mann, FRS, FRSC, (born 1 April 1955) is Professor of Chemistry, Director of the Centre for Organized Matter Chemistry, Director of the Centre for Protolife Research, and was Principal of the Bristol Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol, UK. == Education == Mann was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in 1976, and a DPhil from the University of Oxford in 1982 under the supervision of Professor R. J. P. Williams FRS. == Career == Following his DPhil, Mann was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Keble College, University of Oxford, and then awarded a lectureship at the University of Bath in 1984 where he was appointed to a full professorship in 1990. Professor Mann moved to the University of Bristol in 1998. == Research == Mann\u2019s research is concerned with the chemical synthesis, characterization and emergence of complex forms of organized matter. His research activities include: biomineralization, biomimetic materials chemistry, synthesis and self-assembly of nanoscale objects, functional nanomaterials, complexity and emergent behaviour in hybrid nanostructures, and solvent-free liquid proteins. His current work is focused on the design and construction of synthetic protocells. Mann has published over 480 scientific papers with a current h-index of 112 and over 45,000 citations, and is listed in the 2014 Thomson Reuters index of world\u2019s most influential scientific minds. == Awards and honours == Mann was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, UK in 2003. Other accolades include: * Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize, Royal Society of Chemistry, 1991. * Fellow Royal Society of Chemistry, 1996. * Max-Planck Society/Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Award, 1998-2003. * Interdisciplinary Award, Royal Society of Chemistry, 1999. * Joseph Chatt Lecture and Medal, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2006. * de Gennes Prize and Medal, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2011. * French-British Prize, Chemical Society of France, 2011. * Royal Society Davy Medal (2016). == References == == External links == * Stephen Mann website: http://www.stephenmann.co.uk * Centre for Organized Matter Chemistry website: http://www.bristolcomc.co.uk * Centre for Protolife Research website: http://www.bristolprotolife.co.uk Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Bristol Category:English chemists Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Academics of the University of Bath Category:Academics of the University of Bristol ",
