    "text": "\"Marija Magdalena\" (English translation: \"Mary Magdalene\") was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, performed in Croatian by Doris Dragovi\u0107. The song was performed fourth on the night (following Spain's Lydia with \"No quiero escuchar\" and preceding the United Kingdom's Precious with \"Say It Again\"). At the close of voting, it had received 118 points, placing 4th of 23. This song is a love song; for a dramatic appearance, she appeared dressed in a white gown and cloak. She was accompanied on stage by one female backing singer dressed in black. At the start of the second verse, she removed the cloak, to reveal a tight bodice. When the number of countries wishing to enter the contest increased sharply, Eurovision began calculating an average of each country's scores from previous years; countries with the best marks could compete in following years. When it emerged that Dragovi\u0107 used offstage accompaniment (i.e. vocals by a male voice choir not on stage), Croatia was penalised by removal of one third of its marks average. It was too late to dock points from that night's score. Goran Karan with \"Kad zaspu an\u0111eli\" succeeded Dragovi\u0107 as Croatian representative at the 2000 Contest. In a May 2018 poll by Eurofest Hrvatska, the Croatian Eurovision Song Contest fan group, \"Marija Magdalena\" was ranked as the 2nd best Croatian ESC entry, behind \"Neka mi ne svane\". ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of 1999 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:1999 songs ",
