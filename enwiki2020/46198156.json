Madeline's success is significant and was a huge step forward for women in Zimbabwe, where women are considered culturally unequal to men. In 2014 there was a scandal as it was alleged that Madeline's husband, Deputy board chairman Eben Makonese of the medical aid society Cimas Medical Aid Society, influenced the appointment of his unqualified brother-in-law as the group's director of medical services. An extract from the Sunday Mail dated 24 August 2014 highlighted: :CIMAS:Setting the record straight :IN OUR issue of April 20\u201326, 2013, we carried an article headlined \"Nepotism scandal rocks Cimas\". :We have since learnt that there is no basis for allegations made in the report.
