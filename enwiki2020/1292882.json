    "text": "Against the Wind is the eleventh studio album by American rock singer Bob Seger and his fourth with the Silver Bullet Band. It was released in February 1980. It is Seger's only number-one album to date, spending six weeks at the top of the Billboard Top LPs chart, knocking Pink Floyd's The Wall from the top spot. ==Release== Against the Wind was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart in its third week and remaining there for five weeks behind Pink Floyd's The Wall before reaching No. 1 and holding the top position for six weeks. By late 1981 the album sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and was certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the album Against the Wind and Capitol Records art director Roy Kohara won the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. ==Critical reception== Rock critic Dave Marsh, writing for Rolling Stone, strongly criticized the album as a betrayal of Seger's longtime fans: \"I'd like to say that this is not only the worst record Bob Seger has ever made, but an absolutely cowardly one as well\" saying that Seger had crafted \"failureproof songs that are utterly listenable and quite meaningless.\" Marsh had followed Seger since before Night Moves, when Seger finally gained national fame, and said in his review that Seger's long, tireless struggle to stardom is trivialized by this record. \"He had to fight hard to prove there was still a place in rock & roll for a guy like him, and, with Night Moves, he won. This is the LP that makes such a victory meaningless ... It makes me sad, and it makes me angry (another emotion that's disappeared here, though it's often fueled Seger's finest work).\" Marsh did concede that on the album \"Seger sings fantastically well\" and called it a \"carefully constructed album.\" A review in The Boston Phoenix echoed some of Marsh's criticisms, saying that Seger offered nothing that hadn't been heard before or equaled his best work, \"only heavy-handed efforts to simulate it.\" In a more positive review in the Los Angeles Times, critic Robert Hilburn said the album was \"close to [Seger's] earlier works\" but represented a \"mastering of the form\" and that the reflective ballads stood out. John Rockwell of The New York Times called it an \"honest, attractive album\" and a \"nice return to his Night Moves form.\" Seger himself said the album \"is about trying to move ahead, keeping your sanity and integrity at the same time.\" ==Track listing== The Silver Bullet Band plays on side one tracks 1\u20133 and on side two tracks 1 & 3\\. The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section plays on side one tracks 4 & 5 and on side two tracks 2, 4, & 5\\. ==Personnel== * Bob Seger \u2013 guitar, vocals, background vocals, guitar solos on \"The Horizontal Bop\" (intro and outro), \"Her Strut\" and \"No Man's Land\" ;The Silver Bullet Band *Drew Abbott \u2013 guitar *Chris Campbell \u2013 bass *Alto Reed \u2013 horn, saxophones on \"The Horizontal Bop\", \"Good For Me\", \"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\" and \"Shinin' Brightly\" *David Teegarden \u2013 percussion, drums ;Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section *Barry Beckett \u2013 piano on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\", \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Pete Carr \u2013 guitar on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\" (including solos), \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Roger Hawkins \u2013 percussion, drums on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\", \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" *David Hood \u2013 bass on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\", \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Jimmy Johnson \u2013 guitar on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\", \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Randy McCormick \u2013 organ on \"No Man's Land\", \"Long Twin Silver Line\", \"Good for Me\", \"Fire Lake\", \"Shinin' Brightly\" ;Additional Musicians *Ginger Blake \u2013 backing vocals on \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\" \"Good For Me\" and \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Sam Clayton \u2013 percussion on \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\" *Laura Creamer \u2013 backing vocals on \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\" \"Good For Me\" and \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Linda Dillard \u2013 backing vocals on \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\" \"Good For Me\" and \"Shinin' Brightly\" *Glenn Frey \u2013 harmony vocals on \"Fire Lake\" and \"Against the Wind\" *Paul Harris \u2013 organ and piano on \"Against the Wind\" and piano on \"Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight\" *Don Henley \u2013 harmony vocals on \"Fire Lake\" *Dr. John \u2013 keyboard on \"Horizontal Bop\" *Bill Payne \u2013 organ, synthesizer, piano on \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\" *Doug Riley \u2013 synthesizer on \"No Man's Land\" *Timothy B.
