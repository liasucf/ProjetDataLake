It is one of the oldest and arguably one of the largest markets in West Africa with thousands of lock-up shops occupying various buildings in the market. The market along with Alaba international market is a major distribution hub for Home videos and music in Lagos State, and one of the biggest in Nigeria. ==Structural composition== Idumota market is so popular that large sales are recorded as early as 7am. The market is made up of multiple storey-buildings with some measuring about 5 or more floors. In 2010, the Lagos State Government demolished some illegal structures in order to improve vehicular and human movement in and around the market. == Neighborhood == During weekdays, the neighborhood of Idumota is densely populated by shoppers, traders and bus passengers.
