    "text": "Ulises Aurelio Casiano Vargas (September 25, 1933 - August 5, 2018) was a Puerto Rican bishop emeritus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mayag\u00fcez, in Mayag\u00fcez.http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dmaya.html Casiano was born at the Palmarejo ward in the nearby town of Lajas, which is also the birthplace of the first native Puerto Rican Roman Catholic cardinal, Luis Aponte Mart\u00ednez. He attended the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in nearby Ponce, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Education (Social Sciences) in 1955. He then became a schoolteacher and school administrator, with a reputation for efficiency. He then joined the University's Regina Cleri Seminar, and continued Theology studies at Our Lady of Angels seminar in New York. Casiano was eventually ordered as a priest on May 30, 1967. He later obtained a Juris Doctor degree in Canonical Law from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Monsignor Casiano was named first bishop for the newly created Diocese of the Mayaguez by Pope Paul VI on March 3, 1976, and was consecrated by Cardinal Aponte Mart\u00ednez on April 30, 1976. A former choirmaster while studying at the Regina Cleri seminar, Casiano has promoted the development of the musical ministries associated with the Mayag\u00fcez diocese. For instance, every Good Friday, at the reading of the Seven Words of Jesus on The Cross at Mayag\u00fcez's cathedral, the sermon features a musical piece, in seven parts, written by local music professor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gaudier (The Elder) in 1873, and played by the diocese's philharmonic orchestra. Monsignor Casiano has earned two nicknames among mayag\u00fcezanos. His stamina, charisma and tenacity earned him the name The Obispator, a portmanteau of the Spanish word for bishop, obispo, and The Terminator (the movie character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger). As he has successfully achieved the construction or remodeling of various diocese landmarks (such as Mayag\u00fcez's cathedral) he has also been nicknamed \"Ulises Trump\". Bishop Casiano retired on July 6, 2011. Pope Benedict XVI named Alvaro Corrada del Rio as his successor. Ulises Aurelio Casiano Vargas died on Sunday August 5, 2018 at Hospital de la Concepci\u00f3n de San Germ\u00e1n, Puerto Rico at age 84. He was buried at Our Lady of the Candelaria Cathedral in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico. ==See also== * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of Puerto Rico * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops == References == ==External links== * Roman Catholic Diocese of Mayag\u00fcez (Official Site in Spanish) ==Episcopal succession== Category:Puerto Rican Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Lajas, Puerto Rico Category:1933 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:Catholic University of America alumni ",
