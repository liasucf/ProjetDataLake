    "text": "Rough and Rowdy Ways is the 39th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on June 19, 2020 by Columbia Records. It is Dylan's first album of original songs since his 2012 album Tempest, following three releases, one a triple album, that covered traditional pop standards. It features contributions from several musicians, including Blake Mills, Fiona Apple, Benmont Tench and Alan Pasqua. The album was preceded by the singles \"Murder Most Foul\", \"I Contain Multitudes\" and \"False Prophet\". Rough and Rowdy Ways was universally praised by critics, and was described as one of Dylan's best works. It peaked at No. 1 in more than ten countries and No. 2 in the United States and Australia. ==Release== On March 27, 2020, the single \"Murder Most Foul\" was released unannounced, Dylan's first original song distributed since 2012. On April 17, 2020, \"I Contain Multitudes\", a second single, was released. Rough and Rowdy Ways was officially announced on May 8, 2020. Rough and Rowdy Ways was released as a double album, with the entirety of the second CD and the entirety of the last side of the vinyl edition dedicated to \"Murder Most Foul\". The album's third single, \"False Prophet\", was released on the same day. On June 11, 2020, Bob Dylan's YouTube channel revealed the full tracklist. ==Critical reception== Rough and Rowdy Ways was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 22 reviews. Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph in June 2020, Neil McCormick hailed the album as \"one long, magnificent ride for his most loyal fans\" and declared, \"The wise old poet has stirred up a cryptic cauldron of truths and clues, philosophy, myths and magic.\" Anne Margaret Daniel, reviewing for Hot Press, said \"Rough and Rowdy Ways is a record we need right now, and it will endure.\" Mikael Wood, in the Los Angeles Times, said the album \"rolls out one marvel after another.\" Writing for Slate, Carl Wilson called the release Dylan's best in \"many years, maybe decades\" for the breadth of its cultural references and the depth of Dylan's lyrics and songwriting. Jon Pareles, chief music critic for The New York Times, labeled the album a \"Critic's Pick,\" describing its songs as \"equal parts death-haunted and cantankerous,\" rivaling \"the grim, gallows- humored conviction of his albums Time Out of Mind (1997) and Love and Theft (2001).\" Writing for The Telegraph India, Jaimin Rajani said this release brings respite and diversity. Ken Tucker of NPR's Fresh Air gave the release a positive review for its musical diversity. In his Substack-published \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau said that the album's impact is \"muffled\" by some \"indistinct\" songs, namely \"Black Rider\" and \"I\u2019ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You\", but declared, \"The decisive musical achievement on Dylan's first album of originals since 2012 is establishing the aged voice that flubbed his Sinatra albums as the sonic signature of an elegiac retrospective.\" ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 with 53,000 units, Dylan's highest-charting album in more than a decade. It marked his seventh consecutive decade of charting top 40 albums. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Accolades for Rough and Rowdy Ways |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| Accolade ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone | Rolling Stones 50 Best Albums of 2020 \u2013 Mid-Year | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Stereogum | Stereogums 50 Best Albums of 2020 \u2013 Mid-Year | |} ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians *Bob Dylan\u2013 vocals, guitar, harmonica *Charlie Sexton\u2013 guitar *Bob Britt\u2013 guitar *Donnie Herron\u2013 steel guitar, violin, accordion, mandolin *Tony Garnier\u2013 bass guitar, acoustic bass *Matt Chamberlain\u2013 drums Additional musicians *Blake Mills *Benmont Tench *Alan Pasqua *Fiona Apple *Tommy Rhodes Engineers *Chris Shaw\u2013 engineering, mixing *Joseph Lorge\u2013 assistant engineering *Greg Calbi\u2013 mastering Artwork *Ian Berry\u2013 front cover photo *Josh Cheuse\u2013 album design *Andrea Orlandi- inner sleeve photo on vinyl edition (also used in video for \"I Contain Multitudes\") ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+Chart performance for Rough and Rowdy Ways |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 5 |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 albums Category:Bob Dylan albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Americana albums Category:Blues albums by American artists Category:Folk albums by American artists Category:Rhythm and blues albums by American artists ",
