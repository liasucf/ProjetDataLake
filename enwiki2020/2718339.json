    "text": "Bottarga is a delicacy of salted, cured fish roe, typically of the grey mullet or the bluefin tuna (bottarga di tonno). The best-known version is produced around the Mediterranean; similar foods are the Japanese karasumi, which is softer, and Korean eoran, from mullet or freshwater drum. It has many names and is prepared in various ways. ==Names and etymology== The English name, bottarga, was borrowed from Italian.; 1st edition The Italian form is thought to have been introduced from the Arabic bu\u1e6dar\u1e2bah \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e\u0629 (plural bu\u1e6dari\u1e2b \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631\u062e), itself from Byzantine Greek (oiot\u00e1rikhon) < 'egg' + \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd 'pickled'. The Italian form can be dated to ca. 1500, since the Greek form transliterated into Latin as ova tarycha occurs in Bartolomeo Platina's De Honesta Voluptate (ca. 1474), the earliest printed cookbook, and an Italian manuscript dating shortly afterward that \"closely parallels\" this cookbook attests to botarghe in the corresponding passage.. Italian MS in the Bitting Collection in the Rare Book Room of the United States Library of Congress. In Platina, the word is the Latin transliteration of \"\" The first mention of the Greek form (oiot\u00e1rikhon) occurs in the eleventh century in the writings of Simeon Seth, who denounced the food as something to be \"avoided totally\",Andrew Dalby, Siren Feasts, 1996, , p.189 although a similar phrase may have been in use since antiquity in the same denotation. 'eggs [of fish] preserved by salting', citing Diphilus of Siphnos quoted in Athenaeus III, 121 C. It has been suggested that the Coptic outarakhon might be the intermediate form between Greek and Arabic, whereas examination of dialectical variants of Greek 'egg' include Pontic Greek \u1f60\u03b2\u03cc\u03bd (traditionally where the mullets are caught) and \u1f40\u03b2\u03cc or \u03b2\u03cc in parts of Asia Minor. The modern Greek name comes from the Byzantine Greek, substituting the modern word \u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03cc for the ancient word . ==History== Bottarga production is first documented in the Nile Delta in the 10th century BCE.Dino Joannides, Semplice: Real Italian Food: Ingredients and Recipes, 2014, , s.v.Mark Kurlansky, Salt: A World History, Knopf, 2011, , p. 39 In the 15th century, Martino da Como describes the production of bottarga by salting then smoking to dry it.Maestro Martino da Como, trans. Stefania Barzini, The Art of Cooking: The First Modern Cookery Book, 2005, , p. 112 ==Preparation== Bottarga of bluefin tuna from Favignana, Sicily Bottarga is made chiefly from the roe pouch of grey mullet. Sometimes it is prepared from Atlantic bluefin tuna (bottarga di tonno rosso) or yellowfin tuna. It is massaged by hand to eliminate air pockets, then dried and cured in sea salt for a few weeks. The result is a hard, dry slab. Formerly, it was generally coated in beeswax to preserve it, as it still is in Greece and Egypt. The curing time may vary depending on the producer and the desired texture as well as the preference of the consumers, which varies by country. Bottarga usually is sliced thinly or grated when it is served. ==Regions== ===Croatia=== In Croatia, the delicacy is known as butarga or butarda. It is usually fried before serving. ===Egypt=== Bottarga is produced in the Port Said area. It is commonly pronounced Batarekh all over Egypt. ===France=== The usual French name is boutargue; in Provence, it is called poutargue and produced in the city of Martigues. ===Greece=== The Byzantine 10th century physician Simeon Seth's instruction on ootaricho (the medieval Greek form of the word): avoid it totally. BNF MS suppl. grec 634, f. 254v detail In Greece, it is called avgotaraxo or avgotaracho () and is produced primarily from the flathead mullet caught in Greek lagoons. The whole mature ovaries are removed from the fish, washed with water, salted with natural sea salt, dried under the sun, and sealed in melted beeswax. Avgotaracho Messolonghiou,Katselis G., et al. (2005). Fisheries research 75:138-148 made from fish caught in the Messolonghi-Etoliko Lagoons, is a European and Greek protected designation of origin, one of the few seafood products with a PDO.Agriculture - Quality Policy - (PDO/PGI) Fresh fish, molluscs and crustaceans and products derived therefrom ===Italy=== In Italy, it is made from bluefin tuna in Sicily, and from flathead mullet in Sardinia, where it is called Sardinian but\u00e0riga. Its culinary properties may be compared to those of dry anchovies, although it is much more expensive. Often, it is served with olive oil or lemon juice as an appetizer accompanied by bread or crostini. It is also used in pasta dishes. Bottarga is categorized as a traditional food product (prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale). ===Mauritania=== Bottarga is produced in Mauritania\"Imraguen Women's Mullet Botargo\", Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity, full text and Senegal.\"La Bottarga tra Sardegna e Senegal\", Affrica, 1 June 2010, full text ===Turkey=== In Turkey, bottarga is made from grey mullet roe. It is listed in the Ark of Taste. It is produced in Dalyan, on the southwestern coast of Turkey, from the mature fish migrating from Lake K\u00f6yce\u011fiz.; ===Spain=== Bottarga in Spain is produced and consumed mainly in the country's southeastern region, in the Autonomous Community of Murcia and the province of Alicante. It is usually made from a variety of roes including, among others, grey mullet, tuna, bonito, or even black drum or common ling (the latter two somewhat cheaper and less valued). Much of its production is centered around the town of San Pedro del Pinatar, to the shores of the Mar Menor, where there are also salt ponds. ===United States=== There are several producers in Florida.Chris Sherman, \"Roe, Roe, Roe at Mote\", Florida Trend, 10/4/2012 full textJohn T. Edge, Bottarga, an Export That Stays at Home, The New York Times July 22, 2013 full textThe Taste of Bottarga, Bradenton Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau in Bradenton, Florida The Manatee county tourist bureau states that the process of making bottarga was depicted in Ancient Egyptian murals and that documentation from the 1500s exists that the Native Americans along the western coast of Florida were consuming dried mullet roe when encountered by European explorers. ===Elsewhere=== There are various small producers elsewhere. For example, bottarga from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is produced in northern Norway, where it is air-dried.\"Bottarga Borealis\" ==Notes== Category:Italian cuisine Category:Mediterranean cuisine Category:Byzantine cuisine Category:Greek cuisine Category:Appetizers Category:Cuisine of Sardinia Category:Roe dishes ",
