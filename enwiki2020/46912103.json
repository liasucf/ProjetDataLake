The dual character of the regiment is shown by the colors of the field, yellow for cavalry, red for artillery. World War I service is indicated by the fess which is based on the arms of ancient Brittany and the arms of Vannes where the unit served.

The boar's head, from the arms of the Oglethorpe family, closely identified with Georgia, the state in which the unit was organized is an ancient symbol of hospitality. ==Training accident== Eighty soldiers of Alpha battery of the 2nd Battalion 80th Field Artillery Regiment were standing in formation on September 27, 1989, when one or more shells apparently over-shot the intended target, landing among them.
