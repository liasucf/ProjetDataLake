The international community considers all Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, which the Israeli government disputes. ==History== Amihai is one of the few Israeli settlements to be founded in the 21st century.

Amona's residents asked to be moved to a hill near the Geulat Zion outpost, east of Shilo. Construction in Amihai began in June 2017.
