Enric Galwey i Garcia or, in Spanish, Enrique Galwey y Garc\u00eda (1864 - 10 February 1931) was a Catalan painter, associated with the Olot school of landscape painting. ==Biography== He was born in Barcelona. His father's family was of English descent. He began his studies at the Escola de la Llotja and, in 1885, went to Olot to perfect his technique with the landscape painter, Joaquim Vayreda. His first exhibition of watercolors in Barcelona came that same year.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado, In 1889, he decided that his paintings were a bit static and went to Paris to study the works of Rousseau, Corot, Millet and other members of the Barbizon school. His stay coincided with the first major Impressionist exhibition, which also had a significant influence on his style. When he returned in 1890, he held an exhibition at the Sala Par\u00e9s, which received good critical reviews, and opened a workshop in central Barcelona. He continued to make frequent trips to Olot until Vayreda's death and, for the rest of his life, was a regular visitor to Valldemossa on Mallorca. His first showing at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts came in 1895 and he took second place there in 1897. Together with Modest Urgell and Llu\u00eds Graner, he founded the \"Societat Art\u00edstica i Liter\u00e0ria de Catalunya\", a society of middle-class artists, writers and art collectors who were opposed to Modernisme.Brief biography @ the Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana. From 1900 to 1926, the society held annual exhibitions at the Sala Par\u00e9s. He was also an active member of the Cercle Art\u00edstic de Sant Lluc. He died in Barcelona. In 1934, the Sala Par\u00e9s published his brief memoir: El que he vist a can Par\u00e9s en els darrers quaranta anys: mem\u00f2ries d'Enric Galwey. == Selected paintings == File:Enric Galwey Garcia- Paisatge- 1692.JPG|Untitled landscape Galwey- Paisatge amb n\u00favols.jpg|Untitled landscape File:Galwey- Barques a la platja.jpg|Boats on the Beach Figura amb paisatge - Enric Galwey Garcia - Llegat 56 - 1689.JPG|Landscape with Figure == References == == Further reading == * Meritxell Casades\u00fas, Francesc Fontbona, Engr\u00e0cia Torroella; La Finestra oberta : paisatgisme catal\u00e0 1860-1936, Institut d'Edicions de la Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona, 2004 == External links == *ArtNet: More works by Galwey.
