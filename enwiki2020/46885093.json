The Lightning entered the season as the defending Eastern Conference champions. The regular season began on October 8, 2015 against the Philadelphia Flyers with a 3\u20132 victory, with Jason Garrison scoring the first 3-on-3 overtime goal in NHL history. ==Off-season== ===June=== The off season for the Lightning began on June 15, 2015, when the lightning lost in the Stanley Cup final in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks. On June 17, 2015, during exit interviews, Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman stated that his number one priority was to sign Steven Stamkos to a long term contract. Stamkos also expressed his desire to remain with the team when stated that \"I've said it all along, I want to win a championship with this group. It's been a great ride this year. I know we'll have some talks, whether it's in the next day or weeks, I don't know. But we'll definitely be getting something worked out hopefully shortly.\" Yzerman expressed that Stamkos had done everything that the team asked of him and that Stamkos played through an injury during the playoffs. The nature and the extent of the injury were not revealed during exit interviews. Yzerman also addressed the teams goaltending and expected roster changes in his interview. Yzerman stated that he would be really comfortable with Ben Bishop and Andrei Vasilevskiy as the goalies heading into the season. Yzerman also added that he was not looking to move either goalies, and that he'd like to enjoy the tandem for another year or two. When answering questions on the roster, Yzerman said that he did not expect a lot of roster changes by pointing out that Vladislav Namestnikov, Jonathan Drouin, and Nikita Nesterov will get more opportunities with the team in the coming season. On the injury front, Lightning center Tyler Johnson revealed that he was not sure if his broken right wrist would require surgery in the off season. He said that he got hurt in Game one of the Stanley Cup Final when he landed on it after getting checked at mid-ice by Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook. Goalie Ben Bishop said that his groin tear suffered in the final will not require surgery, just rest in the off season. On June 22, 2015, the Lightning released its preseason schedule for the 2015\u201316 NHL season. The Lightning will be playing the Nashville Predators, Florida Panthers, and Dallas Stars at Amalie Arena and at their opponents venue.

Along with being the host arena, the Johnstown Cambria County War Memorial Arena will receive $150,000 in upgrades. Fans may be familiar with the arena, because it was the inspiration for Charestown and the Chiefs in the 1977 Paul Newman film Slap Shot. Later in the same day, assistant coach George Gwozdecky announced that he was leaving the team to pursue other opportunities. Gwozdecky said that he felt this decision coming for \"a while,\" and that after his two-year deal expired, he and the team mutually agreed to part ways. He also stated that \"I have nothing but great memories, great things to say about the team, about the organization,\" and that \"it was a great learning experience. In his phone interview, Gwozdecky said he does not have anything lined up, other than some rest and relaxation. George will be attending this week's NHL draft with the Lightning, and taking part in the coaches association meetings before making his annual drive back home to Denver. On June 23, 2015, the Lightning announced that they will continue their partnership with the Lyon Hockey Club Lions for the 2015-16 season. The affiliation will last the entire season, which includes business and marketing elements for the clubs. The key component is that the Lightning's AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, will hold training camp and play preseason games versus the Utica Comets in Lyon, France. The games will take place at Charlemagne Skating Rink, which has been home to the Lions since 1967. On June 24, 2015, the National Hockey League held its annual awards ceremony in Las Vegas.

From there Yzerman oversaw the rebuild of the roster that reached the 2015 Stanley Cup Final, with only two holdovers from the 2011 team (Steven Stamkos, Victor Hedman). Yzerman bolstered the roster with draft acquisitions (Nikita Kucherov, Ondrej Palat), free agency (Brian Boyle, Valtteri Filppula, Tyler Johnson, Anton Stralman), and trades (Ben Bishop, Ryan Callahan, Braydon Coburn, Jason Garrison). This resulted in the Lightning setting franchise records with 50 wins and 108 points during the regular season. The Lightning led the league with 262 goals and 32 home wins. In the playoffs the Lightning captured their second Prince of Wales Trophy in franchise history, which earned them a berth in their second Stanley Cup Final. The Lightning are set to host a four team rookie tournament at Germain Arena in Estero, Florida, which takes place from September 12\u201315. The arena is the home of the Lightning's ECHL affiliate, the Florida Everblades. The teams participating will be the Nashville Predators, the Florida Panthers and the Washington Capitals. This is the first time in franchise history that the Lightning has hosted a rookie tournament. As with previous tournaments the team participated in, the tournament will feature some of the top young talent the respective teams have to offer. On June 28, 2015, the Lightning announced the signing of forward Jonathan Marchessault to a one-year, two way contract. Marchessault appeared in two Stanley Cup Playoff games with the Lightning this past postseason. He also appeared in two games during the regular season, recording one goal.

Angelidis appeared in three games with the Lightning last season, recording 12 penalty minutes.

Dr. Karl Illig said that 90 to 95 percent of people get back to being a high level athlete. The prognosis for Vasilevskiy's recovery is between two and three months.

On September 24, 2015, the Lightning announced that defenseman Dominik Masin had been reassigned to the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League, which reduces the training camp roster to 53. Masin is expected to get a larger role playing for the Petes this season than he would have with the crowded blue line in Syracuse. On September 27, 2015, the Lightning announced a series of roster cuts that reduced their training camp roster to 29 players. The Lightning prospects cut from that list are Blujus, DeAngelo, Dotchin, Erne, Gourde, Hart, Ikonen, Peca, Richard, Vermin, Walcott and Wilcox.

On October 5, 2015, the Lightning announced that forwards Mike Angelidis and Jonathan Marchessault had been placed on waivers for the purpose of assigning them to the Syracuse Crunch. Both forwards will have to go unclaimed on waivers for twenty four hours before they are officially assigned the Crunch. The Lightning also provided an update on injured backup goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Today Vasilevskiy did an on ice work out goalie coach Frantz Jean, facing shots from close range. He is still on blood thinners, which is restricting him from facing shots in the left shoulder area. He has an appointment on October 21, which will hopefully clear him for a return to full practice. Vasilevskiy stated that he thinks he will need a few games in Syracuse on a conditioning assignment before he is ready to return to the lineup. On October 6, the Lightning announced that goalie Kristers Gudlevskis and defenseman Luke Witkowski had been assigned to the Syracuse Crunch. With Gudlevskis assigned, it appears that Kevin Poulin will serve as the temporary backup behind Ben Bishop.

On October 7, 2015, the Lightning assigned Slater Koekkoek to the Syracuse Crunch. Yzerman said that both Koekkoek and Witkowski impressed during training camp and are expected to help the Lightning during the season when needed.

They're better off playing a lot of minutes in the American Hockey League.\" On the same day, Lightning head coach Jon Cooper announced that Ryan Callahan will wear a permanent \"A\" as an alternate captain this season. Cooper said the other \"A\" will be rotated among a group of players for the season. ==Standings== ==Schedule and results== ===Preseason=== {| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\" |- valign=\"top\" | 2015 Preseason game log: 3\u20133\u20131 (Home: 2\u20130\u20131; Road: 1\u20132\u20130; Neutral: 0\u20131\u20130) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
