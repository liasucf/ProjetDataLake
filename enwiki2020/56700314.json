    "text": "thumb| Armstrong believes cosmic Extensionalism is a direct universal transcendence, in art and in the artist. Cosmic Extensionalism or Cosmic X is a new style of Art which was originally founded by Jack Armstrong in 1999. Armstrong was inspired by an ethereal experience he had with the famous gem stone known as the Black Star Sapphire of Queensland. The stone is believed to have magical powers. At the time he destroyed all of his previous works. Cosmic X is a genre of modern art styles as is the famous genres of \"Cubism\" by Picasso or \"Pop Art\u201d by Warhol. It was originally founded as an organic art movement and is singular by comparison. Cosmic X requires the artist to become the art they are creating, by feeling no separation between the art itself. This requires a unique state of mind to be reached, connecting to a universal presence, which Armstrong believes exists in each being. It is this connection that creates the art, not the artist.\" Armstrong\u2019s hair, fingerprints and DNA is present in all his paintings. References Category:Art movements ",
