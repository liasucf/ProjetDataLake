Its toponym is said to be derived from a Celtic cross that stood in a field outside the village, in the townland of Aughnaglea and also from its distance of six Irish miles from Omagh. The original Irish name for Sixmilecross is Na Corracha Mora, this refers to marshy ground, probably the ground that runs along the Glusha river at the back of the village. Sixmilecross is one of the few villages in County Tyrone that lost all connection with its Irish root name. It is situated in the historic barony of Omagh East and the civil parish of Termonmaguirk. The village has a wide, tree lined main street and a population of 282 in the 2001 Census. Sixmilecross is in the Omagh District Council area about south-east of Omagh. ==History== The great O'Neill dynasty of Tyrone had some connection with the area because the hill above the village was known as Tulach U\u00ed Neill, meaning O'Neill's Hill. It lies above the Presbyterian Church in the village and is still known as Tullyneil. Tullyneil hill is said to be the geographical centre of Ulster. Sixmilecross is believed to have been established in 1634. St Michael's Church of Ireland has a stained glass window commemorating the Dunlap family, one of whom, John Dunlap printed the United States Declaration of Independence. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway (PD&O;) opened Sixmilecross railway station in September 1861 and the Ulster Transport Authority closed the station and the PD&O; line in February 1965. ==People== * Willie Anderson (rugby coach), was born here. * Mic Christopher, singer-songwriter, has maternal roots here; his mother, Vaun (n\u00e9e Heaney), comes from Sixmilecross. * Sixmilecross was the home of the poet W.F.
