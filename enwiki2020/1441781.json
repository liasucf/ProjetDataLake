    "text": "A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night is an album of classic 20th-century standards sung by American singer Harry Nilsson. The album was arranged by Frank Sinatra's arranger Gordon Jenkins, and produced by Derek Taylor. In 1988, it was reissued as A Touch More Schmilsson in the Night, containing an intro and outro (studio chatter) and six additional songs from the recording sessions. This album is notable in being a standards album produced a decade before such works started to become popular again. The title is an allusion to Shakespeare's Henry V, Act 4, in which the Chorus refers to Henry's nocturnal visit to his troops as \"a little touch of Harry in the night\". ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1973) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |- |United States (Billboard 200) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |} ==Personnel== *Harry Nilsson \u2013 \"The Singer\" *Judd Proctor \u2013 guitar *Charlie LaVere \u2013 piano *Ken Dryden \u2013 flute *David Snell \u2013 harp *Derek Taylor, Jim Brown, Jim Buck \u2013 French horn *Bill Povey, Bob Burns, Jock Sutcliffe, Martin Gatt, Roy Willox \u2013 woodwind *Alan Dalziel, Ben Thomas, Bram Martin, Brian Hawkins, Derek Jacobs, Eric Eaden, Francisco Gabarro, Frank Clarke, Fred Parrington, Gwyn Edwards, Harry Danks, Jack Mandel, Jack Rothstein, John Sharpe, John Underwood, Julian Gaillard, Laurie Lewis, Leo Birnbaum, Lou Sofier, Max Salpeter, Peter Benson, Peter Halling, Sidney Margo, Ted Bryett, Trevor Williams, William Armon \u2013 strings *Gordon Jenkins \u2013 arranger, conductor *Jack Mandel \u2013 music contractor ;Technical *Martin Wyatt \u2013 associate producer *Chrissie Hayes \u2013 assistant producer *Phil McDonald \u2013 engineer *Tom Hanley \u2013 cover photography ==References== Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, A Category:Covers albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Albums arranged by Gordon Jenkins Category:Albums conducted by Gordon Jenkins ",
