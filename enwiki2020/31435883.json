    "text": "John Cottingham (born 1943) is an English philosopher. The focus of his research has been early-modern philosophy (especially Descartes), the philosophy of religion and moral philosophy.University of Reading: John Cottingham (Accessed 7 April 2011)Athanassoulis, Nafsika and Vice, Samantha eds. (2008) The Moral Life: Essays in Honour of John Cottingham, Palgrave Macmillan He is a Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Reading, Professorial Research Fellow at Heythrop College, University of London, and Honorary Fellow of St John\u2019s College, Oxford. He is also a current Visiting Professor to the Philosophy Department at King's College, London. Cottingham has served as editor of the journal Ratio, president of the Aristotelian Society, of the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion, of the Mind Association and as Chairman of the British Society for the History of Philosophy. A Festschrift with responses by Cottingham, The Moral Life, was published by Palgrave in 2008. Cottingham was educated at Merchant Taylors\u2019 School near London, and St John\u2019s College, Oxford. == Research == ===Descartes=== Cottingham introduced trialism as an alternative interpretation of the mind\u2013body dualism of Descartes. Although composed of two substances, mind and body, the human being possesses distinctive attributes in its own right (including sensations, passions, emotions), and these form a third category, that cannot be reduced to thought or extension.Cottingham, John (1985) \u2018Cartesian Trialism\u2019, Mind, XCIV No. 374, April, pp. 218-30. Reprinted in Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Critical Assessments, ed. G. Moyal (London: Routledge, 1991). Vol. III, pp. 236-248, and Cottingham, Cartesian Reflections, ch. 9. Cottingham has also argued that Descartes\u2019s view of animals as \u2018machines\u2019 does not have the reductionistic implications commonly supposed.Cottingham, John, \u2018A Brute to the Brutes? Descartes\u2019 Treatment of Animals\u2019, Philosophy Vol. 53 (1978), pp. 551-59; repr. in Cottingham, Cartesian Reflections, ch. 8. Finally, Cottingham has explored the importance of Descartes as a moral philosopher, with a comprehensive picture of the good life that draws both on his scientific work (in physiology and psychology) and also on the theistic outlook that informs all his philosophy.Cottingham, John, Cartesian Reflections, chs 1, 12, 13. Cottingham is co-editor and translator of the three-volume Cambridge edition of The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch (eds), The Philosophical Writings of Descartes, vols I and II (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), and vol. III, The Correspondence, by the same translators plus A. Kenny (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991). ===Moral philosophy and philosophy of religion=== Cottingham criticizes a putative psychological impoverishment of contemporary moral philosophy, and argues that any plausible theory of a good and integrated life for human beings needs to draw on the insights available from a broadly psychoanalytic perspective.Cottingham, John, Philosophy and the Good Life, ch. 4. His work on partiality defends the importance of self-concern as a central ingredient in virtue.See Cottingham \u2018The ethics of self-concern\u2019, Ethics 101 (July 1991), pp. 798-817, \u2018Partiality and the Virtues\u2019, in R. Crisp (ed.), How Should One Live? Essays on the Philosophy of Virtue (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 57-76, and \u2018Impartiality and Ethical Formation,\u2019 in B. Feltham and J. Cottingham (eds), Partiality and Impartiality: Morality, Special Relationships and the Wider World (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 65-83. In On the Meaning of Life, he addresses the relationship between moral, aesthetic and religious modes of awareness in constituting a meaningful life.On the Meaning of Life (London: Routledge, 2003) Cottingham\u2019s more recent work in the philosophy of religion argues for the primacy of the moral and spiritual aspects of religious allegiance over theoretical and doctrinal components.The Spiritual Dimension: Religion, Philosophy and Human Value (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) ==Selected works== * (2015) How to Believe, Bloomsbury. * (2009) Why Believe?
