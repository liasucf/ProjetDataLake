He left Armagh to study at Queen's University, where he completed a degree in Philosophy and Russian studies before subsequently obtaining an MA in Poetry. After leaving college, following a short spell on a media-training course, Cafolla secured a one-year contract with a Belfast film collective. Cafolla himself cites the fact that both poetry and American TV drama had a large influence over him in his adolescence, despite the fact that \"TV never seemed an option for somebody from Armagh\". ==Career== His first television drama Holy Cross (2003) examined the emotive events which occurred on Belfast\u2019s Ardoyne Road in 2001 and signalled the emergence of a television writer of skill and sensitivity. This first foray into television drama earned Cafolla a BAFTA nomination for best new Drama, and a Golden FIPA award for best screenplay. Cafolla has since contributed to the TV drama Messiah and has written episodes for both series of Law & Order: UK, a British adaptation of the long-running US crime series. Other notable work includes a drama-documentary on the life of George Best, and an episode of the TV fantasy series, Camelot. He wrote The Whale, a television film starring Martin Sheen that aired on BBC One in 2014.https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/a5fbb77c-81ef-3563-9d4f-9e64d07c38de He wrote an episode of the historical drama Britannia in 2017.https://deadline.com/2016/04/kelly-reilly-in-talks-to-board-britannia- event-tv-series-sky-1201735338/ ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1969 births Category:British male screenwriters Category:British television writers Category:British male television writers Category:Television writers from Northern Ireland Category:Screenwriters from Northern Ireland Category:Male writers from Northern Ireland ",
