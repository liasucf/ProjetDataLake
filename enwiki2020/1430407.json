The town of Market Drayton lies 5.7 miles (9.2 km) north-east of the village. ==History== Evidence of a Bronze Age burial site was discovered during construction of the bypass in 2002. The Anglo-Saxon settlement, which had a chapel, was the centre of Odenet, a royal manor belonging to Edward the Confessor and held by Roger de Montgomery who supported William the Conqueror after 1066. Hodnet was recorded in the Domesday Book as Odenet. Baldwin de Hodenet built a motte and bailey castle in about 1082 possibly on a moated mound from earlier times. The timber castle was rebuilt in sandstone around 1196 but was burned down in 1264. Hodnet Castle was mentioned in a document of 1223. Odo de Hodnet was granted the right to hold a weekly fair and an annual market by Henry III in the mid-13th century and the village grew to the north and east of the castle by the 12th-century church. In 1752 the estate passed from the Vernons, who had lived there for 250 years to the Hebers whose descendants still own the property. Hodnet Old Hall was a timber-framed manor house surrounded by the park which was recorded on Christopher Saxton's Map of Shropshire in the late-16th century. The old hall was demolished in 1870 when a new hall in the neo-Elizabethan style was built. The gardens were developed in the 1920s. In the 20th century the hall was used as a convalescent hospital during the world wars and in World War II there was an airfield in the grounds for the storage and dispersal of aircraft from Ternhill and RAF Shawbury. ==Governance== Hodnet was the meeting place of an Anglo-Saxon hundred which continued to function after the Norman Conquest. Hodnet is recorded in the Domesday Book as Odenet,Open Domesday Online: Hodnet and the village's 17th-century Hundred House was named for this reason. Its hundred court was merged and moved, during the reign of King Henry I (1100\u20131135), into the Hundred of North Bradford, which was active until the late-19th century.British History Online: Bradford Hundred Hodnet was the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish containing the hamlets of Little Bolas, Hawkstone, Hopton, Kenstone, Losford, Marchamley, Peplow, and Wollerton and the chapelries of Weston-under-Redcastle and Wixhill.

The ancient parish covered 10,700 acres of fertile arable land. The underlying geology consists of red Bridgnorth Sandstone which is covered with glacial till forming a rolling landscape while the flood plain of the River Tern is flat. Marl deposited by retreating glaciers was dug for fertilizer and the resultant marl pits are now wildlife habitats. ==Transport== The four-mile Hodnet bypass, the A53 opened in 2003 at a cost \u00a314 million, taking traffic on the old A53 and A442 roads away from the village's narrow streets. It was built by contractors Alfred McAlpine. Hodnet Station was a stop on the Wellington and Market Drayton Railway, which opened in 1867 and was operated by the Great Western Railway. Lack of use forced the line to close to passenger traffic on 9 September 1963, and to freight four years later.http://archelou.co.uk/ercall_photos/Railway%20line.htm ===Bus Service=== Hodnet is served by the 64 route, operated by Arriva Midlands North, which runs between Shrewsbury and Market Drayton via Shawbury.
