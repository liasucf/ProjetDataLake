It was owned by the municipality. ==History== The company was established on 2 March 1947, though signings for shares had been done since 1943. When the municipality of Skjerstad was merged with Bod\u00f8 on 1 January 2005 an agreement to sell the power company was made, and on 19 November 2005 the company BDF-Energi, owned by Bod\u00f8 Energi (74%) and Fauske Lysverk (26%) bought the company for NOK 125 million. The purchase was strategically important to have control over a 3.3% stake in Salten Kraftsamband.
