    "text": "The infrasonic burglar alarm reacts to shock waves in the air that are produced by a break-in. When an intruder tries to break a window or force open a door or a window, the resultant air pressure variations (or shock waves) produce sound vibrations in the air, from 0.1 \u2013 50 Hz. These low frequency sound vibrations are captured by a very sensitive receiver in the alarm and converted into electronic signals. These signals are then passed through a pre-programmed electronic filtering system for analysis and when found positive, activate the alarm siren immediately; thus dissuading the potential intruder still on the outside of the property. The system is very effective for residential security installations and is basically jam proof against electronic interference, due to its infrasonic technology.
