    "text": "The gens Spuria was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens occur in ancient writers, but many are known from inscriptions. Although at least some were of equestrian rank, and a number of Spurii held public offices in the various municipia, the most illustrious person of this name may have been Lucius Spurius Maximus, a tribune of the Vigiles at Rome during the reign of Septimius Severus. ==Origin== The nomen Spurius is a patronymic surname derived from the praenomen Spurius, without a change in morphology.Chase, p. 131. The original meaning of the praenomen is unclear; it was fairly common in the early Republic, and favoured in many prominent families, but grew less abundant over time, becoming rare by imperial times, probably due to its association with the adjective spurius, meaning \"illegitimate\".Chase, p. 153. An Etruscan origin has been proposed, in which the name might have meant something akin to \"city dweller\", and been synonymous with the Latin praenomen Publius.Deecke, \"Der Dativ Lar\u03d1iale\", p. 43. Although the praenomen eventually vanished into obscurity, as a gentilicium, Spurius remained common throughout the centuries of the empire. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Spurii were Lucius and Gaius, the two most common names throughout Roman history. To a lesser degree, they used a variety of other common praenomina, including Marcus, Quintus, Aulus, and Sextus. Among the more unusual praenomina they used was the Oscan name Ovius, known from the filiation of one of the Spurii at Puteoli in Campania. ==Members== * Spuria A. l., a freedwoman named in an inscription from Rome.. * Spuria L. l., a freedwoman buried in a family sepulchre at Rome, dating to the first half of the first century, and dedicated by her son, Lucius Spurius Communis, for his mother, his brother, Lucius Spurius Picentinus, patron, Lucius Spurius Heracles, and Visena Olympia.. * Aulus Spurius C. f., dedicated a second-century tomb at Rome for his brother, Gaius Spurius Maximus, a soldier in the Praetorian Guard.. * Gaius Spurius, made an offering to Mercury at Boutae in Gallia Narbonensis.. * Gaius Spurius, buried in a second century tomb at Caesarea in Mauretania Caesariensis.. * Gnaeus Spurius Ov. f., the husband of Singullia, and father of Marcus Spurius and Gnaeus Spurius Frugi, named in an inscription from Puteoli in Campania, dating from the last quarter of the second century BC.. * Lucius Spurius, a soldier named in an inscription from Rome, dating from AD 134.Giacobelli, Gli d\u00e8i propizi, p. 418. * Lucius Spurius, the former master of Spuria Pieris, Lucius Spurius Theophanes, and Lucius Spurius Fortunatus.. * Marcus Spurius Cn. f.
