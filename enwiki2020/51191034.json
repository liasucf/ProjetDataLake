Like most private colleges in the 1970s, Monmouth suffered from declining enrollment,The Daily Register, Shrewsbury, NJ, Dec. 14, 1978, Vol. 101, No. 139, Pg. 3 national economic inflation, and debt from a large building program in the 1960s.The Daily Register, Shrewsbury, NJ, Apr. 28, 1976, Vol. 98, No. 211, Pg. 3 The faculty threatened strikes throughout the decade. There was eventually a two-week faculty strike in 1979 as well as a longer staff strike.
