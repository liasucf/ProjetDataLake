    "text": "The spirit turtle () or spirit tortoise is a mythical turtle found in Chinese and other East Asian cultures. It is believed by East Asian cultures, like other turtles in mythology, to represent longevity (). It is said to be chief among all shelled creatures. ==Identification== Among the Four Intelligent Beasts (), a list of auspicious animals, the turtle goes by several names. Although it can simply be called \"turtle\" ( gu\u012b), it is also referred to as \"old turtle\" ( l\u01ceogu\u012b) and \"spirit turtle\" ( l\u00ednggu\u012b). The latter is sometimes understood as being synonymous with \"divine turtle\" ( sh\u00e9ngu\u012b) although distinctions are made. The term is also used in reference to the turtle shells used in traditional divination. ==China== Zhang-Gui-Shen-gui-tu The Erya provides entries on the terms \"divine turtle\" () and \"spirit turtle\" (). The former term includes an annotation which simply reads \"the most sacred of turtles\" (). According to the Shuyiji ( Tales of Strange Matters) compiled by Ren Fang, a turtle that has lived for one thousand years has grown hair, a five thousand year old tortoise is called a \"divine turtle\" () and an animal older than ten thousand years is called a \"spiritual turtle\" (). The Baopuzi gives a slightly different account, describing the spirit turtle as one thousand years old. While the theme of longevity persists, the age at which the creature is recognized as a \"spirit turtle\" () is in stark contrast with the account found in the Shuyiji. The text continues to describe the turtle as having five colors: blue, red, yellow, white, and black; together representing the five elements. ==Japan== In Japanese mythology, the creature is identified as the Reiki ( \"spirit turtle\"). The Zenrin-kush\u016b provides a k\u014dan that reads Reiki o o hiku ( \"The spirit turtle sweeps its tail\"). It is described as a variant of the phrase Ato o haratte ato sh\u014dzu ( \"Erasing traces creates traces\"). The spirit turtle is an endemic motif at Shint\u014d shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan. The sang\u014d title \"Reigizan\" ( \"Spirit Turtle Mountain\") belongs to several temples across the country, including Tenry\u016b-ji and Rinsen- ji in Ky\u014dto, Hontoku-ji in Himeji, Daich\u014d-ji in Uwajima, and others. It is said the Kameoka Hachimang\u016b shrine at Sendai is so-called because a spirit turtle appeared at the time of its construction. Stone statues of the creature can be found at Zeny\u014dmitsu-ji and Kameoka Hachimang\u016b in Mashiko, Tochigi. Reiki is also the name of the first era of the Nara period. ==Korea== In Korean mythology, it is known as Yeonggwi (hangul: ; hanja: ). ==Popular culture== *Master Roshi from the Dragon Ball franchise is also known as the \"Turtle Hermit\" ( lit. \"Turtle Immortal\"). This title is inspired from the relationship between sages and turtles. *The Spirit Turtle is a character in the Japanese light novel series The Rising of the Shield Hero *Linggui () is the nickname of the character Grey \u03b1 Centauri in the Japanese light novel series Infinite Dendrogram. *The puzzle video game Puzzle & Dragons features two skills, each called Pentagon - Spirit Turtle Dance and Tri-Guard - Spirit Turtle Dance. They are attributed to the monsters Dark Paths Guardian Genbu, Meimei and Awoken Meimei, respectively. The title of the former character is derived from the Japanese name for the Black Tortoise of Chinese astrology. *It is the name of a game piece in Taikyoku sh\u014dgi. ==See also== *Ao (turtle) *Bixi *Black Tortoise *Cultural depictions of turtles *Kashyapa *World Turtle ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:Chinese culture Category:Chinese mythology Category:Four benevolent animals Category:Japanese legendary creatures Category:Legendary turtles ",
