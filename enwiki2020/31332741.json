    "text": "Holtfreter's solution (Holtfreter's medium) is a balanced salt solution that was developed by the developmental biologist Johannes Holtfreter for studying amphibian embryos and to reduce bacterial infections. As a specialised aqueous solution, it finds use in aquaria to prevent infections for early stage amphibians, where it is typically mixed with soft tap water. Amphibians such as axolotls prefer a hard water solution. ==Composition== Molarity of the component salts are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | NaCl || 0.059 M |- | KCl || 0.00067 M |- | CaCl2 || 0.00076 M |- | NaHCO3 ||0.0024 M |} ==Notes== * https://www.msu.edu/user/eisthen/lab/methods/animalcare/holtfr.html [link now dead] ==References== * Armstrong, J.B., Duhon, S.T., and Malacinski, G.M.
