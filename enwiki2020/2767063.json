    "text": "Sky was an American rock power trio active in the early 1970s, based in Detroit, Michigan. It released two albums with RCA before breaking up in 1973. It's mostly known today as an early point in musician Doug Fieger's career, later the frontman of The Knack. ==History== The group started out as their members finished high school in the Detroit, Michigan area. It consisted of Doug Fieger (bass, lead vocals), John Coury (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Rob Stawinski (drums, backing vocals). Sky gained a local following after serving as an opening act for popular groups such as Jethro Tull, The Who, Joe Cocker, Bob Seger, and The Stooges. It also played with Traffic numerous times. The group put out two albums on RCA, 1970's Don't Hold Back and 1970's Sailor's Delight (both produced in England by the Rolling Stones' producer, Jimmy Miller). Their sound was country rock along the lines of The Grateful Dead's then current phase mixed with harmony and hard rock influences. Traffic also strongly influenced their style. Sky composed and performed the soundtrack music for Roger Corman's \"Private Duty Nurses\" in 1971, and appeared in the film as Sky, the band playing at Schlumpfelder's Bar.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067618/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm Sky broke up shortly after their second album's release. The band is mostly remembered today for launching the career of musician Doug Fieger, who would later move to Los Angeles and start the seminal power pop/new wave group The Knack. Coury later worked as a guitarist and songwriter on several Don Henley and Randy Meisner albums. Stawinski worked a time in the prominent British power pop band Badfinger. ==See also== *Music of Detroit *1970s in music == References == Category:American country music groups Category:Musical groups from Detroit ",
