    "text": "\"The Damned Don't Cry\" is a song by British pop group Visage, released as a single by Polydor Records in 1982. ==Background== It was the first single from Visage's second album, The Anvil. The cover art of the 7\" single (seen to the right) differed from that of the 12\" single, which featured the same models but without Steve Strange. \"The Damned Don't Cry\" was a chart success, becoming Visage's second-highest charting single in the UK (No. 11) and the band's last international hit. ==Music video== \"The Damned Don't Cry\" was the second Visage video directed by Midge Ure. It was shot at Tenterden Town railway station in Kent, and recreates the 1930s atmosphere and mood of the Orient Express. The clip was included on the band's 1986 video release Visage. The model and singer Nick Kamen appears in this video. ==Track listing== * 7\" single (1982) # \"The Damned Don't Cry\" \u2013 3:52 # \"Motivation\" \u2013 3:35 * 12\" single (1982) # \"The Damned Don't Cry\" (Dance Mix) \u2013 5:43 # \"Motivation\" \u2013 3:46 ==Personnel== *Steve Strange \u2013 vocals *Midge Ure \u2013 synthesizer *Billy Currie \u2013 synthesizer, electric violin *Rusty Egan \u2013 electronic drums programming *Dave Formula \u2013 synthesizer *Perri Lister \u2013 backing vocals *Lorraine Whitmarsh \u2013 backing vocals ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Germany |align=\"center\"|39 |- |align=\"left\"|United Kingdom |align=\"center\"|11 |- |} ==References== Category:1982 singles Category:Songs written by Midge Ure Category:Visage songs Category:Songs written by Steve Strange Category:Songs written by Rusty Egan Category:Songs written by Billy Currie Category:Songs written by Dave Formula Category:1981 songs Category:Polydor Records singles ",
