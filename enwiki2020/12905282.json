He also owned a printing business, with an office on Union Boulevard. In the late 1960s, Shelton ran for Police Commissioner in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He finished in fifth place. Shelton served as the UKA leader starting in 1961, which peaked with an estimated 30,000 members. In 1966 Shelton received a year in prison and $1,000 fine for contempt of the United States Congress, \"for refusing to turn over membership lists to the House Committee on Un-American Activities.\" In 1984, James Knowles, a UKA member of the UKA's Klavern 900 in Mobile, was convicted of the 1981 murder of Michael Donald. At trial Knowles said he and Henry Hays killed Donald \"in order to show Klan strength in Alabama.\" In 1987, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) brought a civil case, on behalf of the victim's family, against the United Klans of America for being responsible in the lynching of Donald, a 19-year-old black man. Unable to come up with the $7 million awarded by a jury, the UKA was forced to turn over its national headquarters to Donald's mother, who then sold it.Morris Dees and Steve Fiffer.

Forever.\" ==Death== Shelton died of a heart attack on March 17, 2003 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. ==References== ==External links== * United Klans of America History * Endnotes: Robert Shelton Biography * Photos of Robert Shelton from the Moncrief Photograph Collection at the Mississippi Archives Category:1929 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Tuscaloosa, Alabama Category:Leaders of the Ku Klux Klan Category:Activists from Alabama ",
