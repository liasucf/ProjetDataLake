    "text": "2019\u20132020 Jammu and Kashmir lockdown refers to a security lockdown and communications blackout imposed to prevent protests during which thousands of people, mostly young men, have been detained in Jammu and Kashmir. The government stated that the lockdown is aimed at curbing terrorism. == Timeline == The lockdown started on 5 August 2019 following Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir via scrapping of the Article 370 of the Constitution of India, Article 35A of the Constitution of India and the introduction of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. Since 5 August, no foreign journalists have been granted permission from the Indian government to report in Kashmir. According to a September 6 report of the Indian government, nearly 4,000 people have been arrested in the disputed region. Among those arrested were more than 200 politicians, including two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K;), along with more than 100 leaders and activists from All Parties Hurriyat Conference. On 1 October 2019, a three-judge bench consisting of Justices N. V. Ramana, Ramayyagari Subhash Reddy and Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai of the Supreme Court of India, heard seven petitions on the lockdown. On 3 October 2019, journalists in Kashmir staged a sit-in protest against the communications blackout describing the blockade of the internet and mobile phones as a 'gag'. On 4 October 2019, the Indian government denied US Senator Chris Van Hollen's request to travel to Kashmir. Meanwhile, Sandeep Pandey, an education reformer, and other activists who were on an informal fact-finding mission were also barred from leaving the airport in Srinagar. The same day, during protests people chanted pro-Pakistan slogans and demanded an end to what they described as \"Indian occupation of their territory\". On 24 October 2019, amid a boycott by most parties and with many mainstream local politicians still in detention, village council elections were held across J&K.; However, political scientist Noor Ahmed Baba called it \"more like an artificial exercise\". Prepaid mobile services were barred for the 85th consecutive day on 28 October, for at least 2.5 million prepaid cell phone users in Kashmir. In January 2020, 2G internet connection was allowed in Jammu & Kashmir for certain whitelisted sites. A new curfew was imposed a day ahead of the first anniversary of India's decision to revoke the disputed region's semi-autonomy. Officials announced a two-day \"full curfew\" citing intelligence reports of looming protests in the Muslim-majority region, where locals have called for the anniversary to be marked as a \"black day\". On August 16, 2020 4G/LTE mobile services were restored in two districts of the union territory of J&K; on a trial basis, after Supreme Court of India ruled an indefinite shutdown was illegal. == Re-introduction of tourism == Despite public protests and resistance as well as the restrictions on Internet and phone usage, the government of India plans to re-introduce tourism in Kashmir and lift security restrictions for foreigners visiting that region. ==Reactions== * \u2013 Alice Wells, the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, said in a statement that the U.S. hopes \"to see rapid action \u2013 the lifting of the restrictions and the release of those who have been detained\".
