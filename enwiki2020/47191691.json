This was the first film produced by West's Pictures, which later became part of Greater Union. From 1911 to 1913, a series of mergers resulted in the formation of The Combine, a powerful alliance between exhibitor Union Theatres and the production and distribution company Australasian Films. The Combine imported many of its films and was blamed by independent competitors for a drop in the local production of films. In 1932, the box-office hit On Our Selection was produced by Cinesound Productions, a subsidiary which had been set up the previous year by Greater Union Theatres. In 1936, businessman Norman Rydge was elected chairman and managing director of Greater Union Theatres after buying a controlling interest. The company returned to profitability within three years. In 1942, Cinesound co-produced Kokoda Front Line!, the first Australian film to win an Academy Award. A full-length version of a wartime newsreel, it won an Oscar for best documentary. 1980s: In 1980, Alan Rydge inherited the company on the death of his father, becoming the youngest chairman of an Australian public company. In 1984, the company was once again fully Australian-owned after gaining control of Rank Organisation's half share. In 1987, the company acquired Thredbo Alpine Resort.https://www.thredbo.com.au/about-thredbo/history/ Retrieved 4th May 2020. In 1988, Rydge wanted to begin a hotels division and so recruited David Seargeant, who later became managing director. 2000s: In 2004, Amalgamated Hospitality Limited suffered a share plunge after writing off more than $70 million on its German cinemas. In 2005, Greater Union dropped its ban against cinemagoers bringing their own snacks and drinks after an investigation by the New South Wales Commissioner for Fair Trading. The same year, the Rydge family expanded its compound on Point Piper by buying a sixth adjoining property. In 2009, Meredith Hellicar resigned from the company board after being criticised in a judgement by the New South Wales Supreme Court for her part in approving, while chairwoman of James Hardie, a press release which falsely claimed that a trust for asbestosis victims had been fully funded. 2010s: In 2010, Amalgamated bought a chain of cinemas in New Zealand and Fiji from Skycity Entertainment Group. The same year, it also acquired outdoor cinema operator Moonlight Cinema for $1.75 million from Prime Media Group. In the financial year 2010\u20132011, Alan Rydge was among the wealthy Australians who donated to a secret fund set up for Sydney politician Malcolm Turnbull. In 2011, Amalgamated sold its 49 per cent share of a cinema chain in the Middle East. The same year, its operations in Queensland suffered losses due to severe flooding in 2010-2011. In 2013, the Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney was sold to Moss Capital for an estimated A$15 million. Amalgamated had owned the park since 1996. In 2014, a three-year plan was unveiled to build or redevelop 14 new cinemas. In December 2015, the company changed its name to Event Hospitality & Entertainment Limited. Its ticker code changed from AHD to EVT on the Australian Securities Exchange. In November 2016, David Seargeant gave notice that he would step down as managing director and CEO in the second half of 2017. He was replaced by Jane Hastings. In 2017, the company sold its two- thirds interest in a Fiji cinema joint venture. 2020s: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in mandatory government-ordered closures of cinema locations between March 2020 to July 2020 in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government also converted many Rydges hotel locations to mandatory quarantine stations for international and domestic travellers. ==See also== * Cinema of Australia \u2013 History * Notable Australian businesses ==References== == External links == * * EVT at Australian Securities Exchange * EVT:AU at Bloomberg Category:Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Holding companies of Australia ",
