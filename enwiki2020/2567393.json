It was intended as a reward for exceptional officers, notable as the first decoration that could be granted to non-nobles. By the authorities of the French Republic, it is considered a predecessor of the Legion of Honour, with which it shares the red ribbon (though the Legion of Honour is awarded to military personnel and civilians alike). Although officially abolished by the government authorities of the July Revolution in 1830 following the French Revolution, its activities carried on as a dynastic order of the formerly sovereign royal family. As such, it is still recognised by the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry.Icoregister ==Members== Letter granting Sieur des Chaillons the title of Knight, 25 March 1730 The King was the Grand Master of the order, and the Dauphin was automatically a member as well. The Order had three classes: *Grand-Croix (Grand Cross) *Commandeur (Commander) *Chevalier (Knight) The entire order included 8 Grand Crosses, 28 Commanders and a variable number of Knights. Officers of the Order included, after the Grand Master, a Tr\u00e9sorier (Treasurer), a Greffier (Registrar) and a Huissier (Gentleman Usher). The badge of the order consisted of a portrait of Saint Louis surrounded by the motto \u00ab LUD(OVICUS) M(AGNUS) IN(STITUIT) 1693 \u00bb (\"Louis the Great instituted it in 1693\"). The reverse features a sword interlaced with a laurel crown and a white sash, with the inscription \u00ab BELL(ICAE) VIRTUTIS PRAEM(IUM) \u00bb (\"reward of wartime valour\"). Knights wore the badge suspended from a ribbon on the breast, Commanders wore a red ribband (sash) over the right shoulder, and recipients of the Grand Cross wore the ribband as well as a star on the left breast. The general assembly of the Order was held annually on 25 August, the feast day of Saint Louis, in the residence of the King. Conditions for being inducted did not include nobility; however, Catholic faith was mandatory, as well as at least ten years' service as a commissioned officer in the Army or the Navy. Members of the Order received a pension. Hereditary nobility was granted to a knight's son and grandsons. Another decoration, the Institution of Military Merit (:fr:Institution du m\u00e9rite militaire) was created for the Protestant officers in service of the French king (mainly foreign mercenaries, as French Protestants were not tolerated at the time). Until the death of Louis XIV, the medal was awarded to outstanding officers only, but it gradually came to be an award that most officers would receive during their career. On 1 January 1791, during the French Revolution, a decree changed the name to d\u00e9coration militaire (\"military decoration\"). It was subsequently withdrawn on 15 October 1792. One of the first acts of Louis XVIII was to reinstate the Order of Saint Louis, using it to award officers of the Royal and Imperial armies alike. In 1830 the new king Louis-Philippe abolished the order, which was never reinstated.

We shall also in the future give a particular attention to increase the advantages of this order, so that we shall ever have the satisfaction to always be able to grant graces to the officers, and on the other hand, seeing rewards guaranteed by valour, they would every day bear renewed ardour in deserving them by their actions. : In these causes, with the advice of our council, and our certain science, full power and royal authority, we have created, instituted and built, by the present, our military Order with the name of Saint Louis, and with the forms, statutes, ordinances and rules as follow: (...) ==References== == External links == * Ordre Royal et Militaire de Saint-Louis\u2014includes photographs, explanations and a 20,000 name list of recipients * Histoire de l'Ordre royal & militaire de Saint-Louis\u2014History of the Order Saint Louis, Order of Category:Military awards and decorations of France Category:Awards established in 1693 Category:1693 establishments in France ",
