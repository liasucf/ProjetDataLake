Belloescu (March 20, 1838 - October 20, 1912) was a Romanian teacher, politician and philanthropist. ==Biography== Born in C\u00e2mpina to the well-to-do shepherds Stroe and Stana Beloiu of the Bra\u015fov area, he graduated from Ghent University in 1863 with a degree in Engineering. He taught Mathematics for two years at what is now the Nicolae B\u0103lcescu National College in Br\u0103ila, rising to director in that time. He moved on to B\u00e2rlad's Gheorghe Ro\u0219ca Codreanu National College in 1868, remaining there until his retirement in 1898. Ion Trif Ple\u015fa, \"Mari t\u00e2lhari din Bere\u015fti\" (\"Great Thieves from Bere\u015fti\"), Via\u0163a liber\u0103, 5 December 2009; accessed March 29, 2011 Belloescu was elected to the Chamber for Tutova County four times and to the Senate twice. An issue of interest to him was that of school textbooks, and in 1872, he authored the first Romanian-language high school arithmetic textbook, which went through four printings. He commanded a battalion during the Romanian War of Independence, becoming an officer of the Order of the Crown in 1882 for his deeds. In 1909, he was raised to grand cross of that order for his educational activities. He established a private fund for the direct aid of the most promising pupils at his B\u00e2rlad school; this operated from 1906 to 1916; among the beneficiaries was \u015etefan Procopiu. He donated the building for what is now B\u00e2rlad's Stroe Belloescu Library, as well as schools for the peasant children of Trestiana and Grivi\u0163a, and a church for the latter village. Also there, in the schoolyard, in 1912, he financed the first bust of Alexandru Ioan Cuza in Romania. The school in Ple\u015fa was donated by him as well, and named after him. Together with his coachman, he was suffocated to death during a robbery in his home. He left a widow, Raluca. == Death == Having the utmost respect to him, the citizens honored him with the confidence to represent them within the committees and societies and even in the Parliament of the Country as a senator. For the citizen services, he received the \"Crown of Romania\" in the degree of \"Great Cross\", one of the greatest distinctions of the time. On October 20, 1912, Stroe S. Belloescu was assassinated by a group of nine robbers from Bere\u0219ti who believed they would find money in his house, not knowing what was his great wealth consisted of.Toader Istode, \u201eMari t\u00e2lhari din Bere\u0219ti (I)\u201d, Via\u021ba Liber\u0103, 5 decembrie 2009Ion Trif Ple\u0219a, \u201eMari t\u00e2lhari din Bere\u0219ti (II)\u201d, Via\u021ba Liber\u0103, 12 decembrie 2009, p. 6Ion Trif Ple\u0219a, \u201eMari t\u00e2lhari din Bere\u0219ti (III)\u201d, Via\u021ba Liber\u0103, 19 decembrie 2009, p. 6 His lifeless body was placed at the National House.
