It is based on the novel of the same name by Ma Boyong. The Longest Day in Chang'an is produced jointly by Youku, Beijing Weying Technology Co.,Ltd, Liu Bai Entertainment and Yuyue Film Co.,Ltd. The series follows the characters Zhang Xiaojing and Li Bi, and their efforts to foil a terrorist attack on Chang'an, the capital of the Tang dynasty (618-907). It began airing in China on Youku from June 27, 2019. ==Story== Zhang Xiaojing is a former soldier in the Longyou Army who served on the frontiers of the Tang dynasty. After retiring, he joined the local security of the city of Chang'an, the heart of the empire, but he was imprisoned and sentenced to death after an incident in which Zhang killed 34 members of a gang that murdered his former Army commander Wen, and then killed his current commanding officer. Zhang is unexpectedly reprieved when plans for a major rebellion are uncovered, involving a terrorist cell, the Wolf Squad, which has slipped into Chang'an before the Lantern Festival, one of the most spectacular days in the ancient Chinese calendar. To secure the safety of the Chang'an people, the Jing'an Si (Department of City Security) grants Zhang a special 24-hour amnesty, and he is ordered to catch the terrorists and foil the plot before the day is out. If he succeeds, he will be freed, otherwise, he will be executed. But to his surprise, Zhang discovers that he has been drawn into a far greater conspiracy against the empire than anyone had suspected. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Lei Jiayin as Zhang Xiaojing * Jackson Yee as Li Bi ===Supporting=== * Zhou Yiwei as Long Bo * Peng Guanying as Qin Zheng * Wu Xiaoliang as Cao Poyan * Han Tongsheng as He Zhizhang * Cai Lu as Cui Qi * Lu Fangsheng as Yao Runeng * Yu Ailei as Yuan Zai * Djimon Hounsou as Master Ge (voiced by Chen Jianbin) * Zhao Wei as Xu Bin * Song Yunhao as Cheng Shen (based on Cen Shen) * Feng Jiayi as Emperor Xuanzong of Tang * Reyizha Alimjan as Tan Qi * Xu Lu as Yang Yuhuan * Wang Herun as Wen Ran * Ai Ru as Wang Runxiu * Gao Ye as Li Xiangxiang * Li Yuan as Yu Chang * Wang Sisi as Ding Tong'er * Qu Shanshan as Xu Hezi * Zhou Lula as Li Yu * Sukhee Ariunbyamba as Mage'er * Yin Zhusheng as Lin Jiulang (based on Li Linfu) * Yang Yi as Wen Wuji * Ge Zhao'en as Prince Yong ==Soundtrack== ==Production== Before shooting, Cao Dun and the screenplay writers read the original novel three times.
