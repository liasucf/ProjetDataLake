Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. mystery thriller film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Harrison Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner. The film score is by Ennio Morricone. == Plot == Dr. Richard Walker (Harrison Ford) is a surgeon visiting Paris with his wife Sondra (Betty Buckley) for a medical conference. At their hotel, she is unable to unlock her suitcase, and Walker determines that she picked up the wrong one at the airport. While Walker is taking a shower, Sondra receives a phone call that Walker can't hear and she mysteriously disappears from their hotel room. Still jet-lagged, Walker searches for his wife in the hotel with the help of a polite but mostly indifferent staff and then wanders outside to look for her himself. A wino overhears him in a caf\u00e9 and says he saw Sondra being forced into a car in a nearby alley. Walker is skeptical, until he finds his wife's ID bracelet on the cobblestones. He contacts the Paris police and the U.S. Embassy, but their responses are bureaucratic, and there is little hope anyone will bother looking for her. As Walker carries on the search himself (with merely sympathetic concern from the hotel staff), he stumbles onto a murder site where he encounters the streetwise young Michelle, who mistook Walker's wife's suitcase for her own at the airport. He discovers that Michelle is a career drug smuggler, but does not care or know for which dealers \u2013 the friend that hired her, D\u00e9d\u00e9, worked for some shady people. Michelle reluctantly helps Walker in his frantic attempt to learn what was packed in her switched suitcase, and how to trade the contents for the return of his kidnapped wife. Following their visit to Michelle's apartment, Walker's hotel room and shabby cabarets, it turns out that the smuggled contents are not drugs, but a krytron, an electronic switch used as a detonator for nuclear weapons, stolen and smuggled inside a souvenir replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the orders of Arab agents. The American embassy, working with Israeli agents, wants to get hold of the precious device, and they have no problem letting Sondra die for it. In order to save his wife, Walker joins forces with Michelle, who is only interested in getting her paycheck. The film ends with a confrontation on the \u00cele aux Cygnes, in the middle of the Seine, next to the enormous Statue of Liberty replica there, where Sondra is to be exchanged for the krytron. However, a gunfight ensues between the Arab agents who were to get the device, and the Israeli agents who traced and followed them. The Arabs are killed in the crossfire and Michelle is hit too, dying soon after having slipped the krytron into Walker's pocket, with Sondra at her side. Furious, Walker shows the krytron to the Israeli agents, and throws it into the Seine. He carries Michelle's body away, and he and Sondra leave Paris. == Cast == * Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Walker * Emmanuelle Seigner as Michelle * Betty Buckley as Sondra Walker * G\u00e9rard Klein as Gaillard * Jacques Ciron as The Hotel Manager * Dominique Pinon as The Wino * Yves R\u00e9nier as The French Inspector * Robert M.
