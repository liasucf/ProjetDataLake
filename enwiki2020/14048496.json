As rail use fell into decline and was discontinued in the mid 20th century, busses came to prominence with the expansion of the road and highway system. The current transportation center was constructed around the station building in 1991. SMART testing began in March 2016.. Service began with preview rides on July 8, 2017, and full service commenced on August 25, 2017. The station acted as the southern terminal of the line until December 14, 2019, when the extension to Larkspur station opened. The bus terminal was reconfigured to allow the SMART tracks to pass through. Marin Airporter service to the San Rafael Transit Center ended on October 6, 2019 due to traffic congestion around the transit center. ==Services== A Marin Transit bus at San Rafael Transit Center in 2018 San Rafael Transit Center has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the SMART mainline.
