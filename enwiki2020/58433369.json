She entered acting in her early age owing to her Armenian mother Bercuhi Han\u0131m, who was a stage actress in the \"Fasulyeciyan Theater Company\". During the six-year lasting theater tour in the Balkans, she married to Ar\u015fag S\u0131vac\u0131yan, who was an actor and comedian of the samr theater company. She gave birth to a son Yetvart. However, she lost her husband and son at a young age. She died at her home in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y on 13 August 1950, and was interred at the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Armenian Cemetery in Uzun\u00e7ay\u0131r, Istanbul. ==Acting career== She debuted on the stage at the age of 14 encouraged by her mother. She performed the role for \"Victor\" in the play \"K\u00f6r\u00fcn O\u011flu\" (\"Son of a Blind\") in Tekirda\u011f. In the following years, she played with the Fasulyeciyan Theater Company. At her age of 18, she became a regular member of the theater company. She toured six years long Balkans, which are today Bulgaria and Romania, with the theater company. Returned home in 1901, she joined the \"M\u0131nakyan Theater Company\". She was the promoted to the leading actress of the theater company. She became also an actress sought by many other theater companies, which were established in the liberal atmosphere of the Second Constitutional Era (1908\u20131919). In 1912, she co- founded the \"Yeni Osmanl\u0131 Tiyatrosu\" (\"New Ottoman Theater\") in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, Istanbul together with Aghavni Zabel Binemeciyan and S\u0131rapyon Hekimyan, another members of the M\u0131nakyan Theater Company. The theater closed down in 1915 following the death of Binemeciyan. On 19 January 1916, she performed in the play \u00c7\u00fcr\u00fck Temel, an adaptation from the French play La Maison d'Argile by \u00c9mile Fabre (1869\u20131955). It was the gala event for the celebration of the opening of the theater section of Dar\u00fclbedayi, the first Imperial conservatory in the Ottoman Empire established in 1914. The Dar\u00fclbedayi in the Ottoman Empire became later Istanbul City Theatres in the Republican Era. Her notable roles were in the theater plays Dalida, Kantocu K\u0131z, Ekmek\u00e7i Kad\u0131n, Fanfan and G\u00fclnihal. She performed under the direction of Muhsin Ertu\u011frul, prominent actor and art director. She unexpectedly retired from acting in the1930s. According to rumors, her departure from the theater was due to the increasing number of Muslim Turkish women in the theater, who spoke Turkish language without accent contrary to non-Muslims. However, as remembered by her disciple actor Vasfi R\u0131za Zobu (1902\u20131992), she left the Istanbul City Theatres resentful. She was associated with notable theater figures of the era like Eliza Binemeciyan (1890\u20131981), Neyyire Neyir (1902\u20131943), Afife Jale (1902\u20131941), Muammer Karaca (1906\u20131978), Muhsin Ertu\u011frul (1892\u20131979), Hagop Ayvaz (1911\u20132006)and Bedia Muvahhit (1897\u20131994). ==Recognition== Muhsin Ertu\u011frul laudably referred to her as \"the most competent actress of the Turkish theater in that era\". Turkish poet Ece Ayhan dedicated her poem \"K\u0131nar Han\u0131m'\u0131n Denizleri\" (\"The Seas of K\u0131nar Han\u0131m\") to K\u0131nar Han\u0131m in her 1959 published book. She was portrayed in the 1979-film Afife Jale, the first Muslim Turkish stage actress. ==Performances== *Dalida (Marta) *Kantocu K\u0131z (Somine) *Ekmek\u00e7i Kad\u0131n (Klaris) *Simone ve Mari (Mari) *Fanfan (Klodine) *G\u00fclnihal (G\u00fclnihal) *Hu\u015fenk (M\u00fcnije) *Alemdar (Cevri Kalfa) *\u00c7\u00fcr\u00fck Temel (Pervin) *Bir \u00c7i\u00e7ek \u0130ki B\u00f6cek (Servinaz Han\u0131m) *Kundak Tak\u0131mlar\u0131 (Peyker) *Ya\u011fmurdan Doluya (M\u00fczeyyen) *Kirli \u00c7ama\u015f\u0131rlar *Kabus (Selma Han\u0131m) *Fare (\u0130clal) *Harap Yurt (Kevser) *Karanl\u0131k Kuyu (Besime) *Azarya (Avare) *D\u00f6rt \u2013 \u00c7ihar *Odal\u0131k *K\u0131smet De\u011filmi\u015f *Bayku\u015f ==References== Category:1876 births Category:Armenians in Istanbul Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Actresses from Istanbul Category:Stage actresses of the Ottoman Empire Category:19th-century actresses of the Ottoman Empire Category:20th- century actresses of the Ottoman Empire Category:Turkish theatre owners Category:Turkish stage actresses Category:20th-century Turkish actresses Category:1950 deaths ",
