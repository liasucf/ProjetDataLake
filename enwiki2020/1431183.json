The Elections Alberta deputy chief electoral officer stated that candidates have four months from the time they are nominated to file financial campaign returns. Mandel stated that \"there is confusion about the actual due dates this paperwork is due to Elections Alberta.

On March 4, 2019, the 5 year ban was lifted after the Court of Queen's Bench ruled that a 5 year ban was an inappropriate penalty for a missed deadline, in this case. ==Electoral Results== ===2004 Edmonton municipal election=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Mayor !width=300px| Candidate !
