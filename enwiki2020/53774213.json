    "text": "French holds the credit of having the second maximum number of translations of the Tirukkural among European languages, next only to English. As of 2015, there were at least 18 translations of the Kural text available in French. ==History of translations== The first translation of the Kural text into French was made by an unknown author, which was titled Kural de Tiruvalluvar and found a place in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France of France in 1767. However, it is E. S. Ariel who is generally credited with bringing the Kural text to the French world. Ariel, who considered the Kural as one of the highest and purest expressions of human thought, translated fragments of the first two divisions of the work, viz. aram (virtue) and porul (wealth) in 1848. Since then several translations appeared in French, chief among which are those by Pierre-Eug\u00e8ne Lamairesse (1867), G. Fontaineu de Barrigue (1889), Dumast, Louis Jacolliot, and Alain Dani\u00e9lou (1942). Gnanou Diagou translated the entire work in 1942, which was first published in Pondicherry. Few other translations were published in the 20th century, including M. Sangeelee (1988) and Fran\u00e7ois Gros (1992). In 2007, Rama Valayden published a translation in Port-Louis, Mauritius. ==Translations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"text- align:center; width:25%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Translation !colspan=\"2\"|Chapitre 26, Abstinence de chair |- !Kural 254 (Couplet 26:4) !Kural 258 (Couplet 26:8) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Gnanou Diagou, 1942||Qu\u2019est ce que la mis\u00e9ricorde?
