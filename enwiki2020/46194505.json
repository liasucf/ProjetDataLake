The inn (\"home\") was built in 1926, and is a two- story, six bay, frame building with Colonial Revival and American Craftsman style design influences. It has a hipped roof and features a full width hip- roofed one-story porch supported by slender Tuscan order columns. Also on the property are three contributing guest cottages built about 1926: the \"Paulownia\" Cottage, \"Boxwood\" Cottage, and \"Twin Poplar\" Cottage. The property was originally developed by the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks of the Southern Railway System as a summer retreat. The union retained the property until 1962. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==References== ==External links== *Orchard Inn website Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Colonial Revival architecture in North Carolina Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1926 Category:Buildings and structures in Polk County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Polk County, North Carolina ",
