It was located between the present-day Bauman and Ulyanovsk streets near Voroshilov Avenue. In 1863, a brick house of worship was built. But the building was fragile, and in 1866 the house was demolished. In 1868, a new two-story synagogue was built in its place. The authorship of the synagogue project is attributed to architect Sovitsky, collegiate assessor and senior city architect. A.G. Kaplun, S.I. Frey-schist, A.A Danziger also participated in construction works. Funds collection was organized by rabbi F.I. Gnesin, who was the father of Mikhail Gnessin, a famous composer. At the end a sum of 16 342 rubles was collected. Main Choral Synagogue was inaugurated on August 30, 1868. The ceremony was attended by Mayor A.M. Baikov. He noted in his speech that he aims \"to equate Jews in terms of social position with the rest of the citizens of the city.\" In 1881 there was built and attached to synagogue a house of worship, which could hold up to 150 people. Jewish Library and Reading Room was opened in the synagogue in 1903. Morevover, it also housed Talmud- Torah School. Thus, the Main Choral Synagogue became a religious and educational complex. The last rabbi of the synagogue before the 1917 Revolution was Z.M. Goldenberg. In 1924, the synagogue was municipalized, but the building continued to be run by the Jewish community. In Summer of 1935 the synagogue was nationalized, and there was establsiged a Dermatological and Venereal Hospital. The building was substantially rebuiltand its architectural appearance was distorted. The interiors have undergone redevelopment, the prayer hall was demolished. The appearance of the synagogue facades was also seriously distorted: the old windows were enlarged, much of the stucco decorations were destroyed.
