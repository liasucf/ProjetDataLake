    "text": "Chhouk Rin is a former Khmer Rouge commander. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of three tourists, Australian David Wilson, 29, Briton Mark Slater, 28, and Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, 27 at Phnom Voar in 1994. In 2005, he escaped to Phnom Penh where he evaded capture because he believed that Sam Bith and Nuon Paet are the guilty ones. After he was captured, he lost an appeal to overturn the ruling that sentenced him to life imprisonment in Prey Sar prison. ==References== Category:Cambodian military personnel Category:Cambodian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Cambodia Category:Cambodian people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Cambodia Category:Living people Category:Communist Party of Kampuchea politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
