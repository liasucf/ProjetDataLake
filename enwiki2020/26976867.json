    "text": "Antonio Il Verso (1565 \u2013 August 23, 1621) was an Italian composer. Il Verso was born at Piazza Armerina, and began his musical studies under the guidance of Pietro Vinci. He was active in Venice in the last years of the sixteenth century is given in Venice, then the seat of the Venetian school, where he refined his studies in the madrigal and polyphonic music. Back in Sicily settled in Palermo where he taught music at the Convent of San Domenico, on Via dei Bambinai. He was an exponent of mannerism and set to music verses major poets such as Torquato Tasso and Gabriello Chiabrera in addition to the major poets of the period. He often utilised melodies of other composers, modifying their style but not distorting their compositional integrity. In the 1591 Second Book of ricercars, Verso based his ricercars on the models of his teacher Vinci. Between 1590 and 1619 Verso composed at least 15 books of madrigals for 5 voices, and additional books for 3 and 4 voices and monodies. He died in Palermo. Il Verso is honoured today as the patron composer of the Palermo-based Associazione per la musica antica Antonio Il Verso, and the early music group Studio di Musica Antica Antonio Il Verso, frequently directed by Gabriel Garrido. ==Works== * 1590 First Book of Madrigals for 5 voices.ANTONIO IL VERSO IL PRIMO LIBRO DI MADRIGALI A CINQUE VOCI - 1590 * 1591 Second Book of 11 Motets and 14 Ricercars in 3 voices by Pietro Vinci with 7 Ricercars by Antonio Il Verso.
