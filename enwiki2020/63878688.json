After graduating with a BA, Ollman purchased fifty-three acres of forestland in Bucksport, Maine, and started a commune while pursuing an interest in photography. He left Maine in 1974 to attend San Francisco Art Institute, and in 1975, the MFA program at Lone Mountain College (now part of University of San Francisco). There he expanded on photographing at night with long exposures, switching from black and white to color. The first museum to purchase Ollman\u2019s images was The Museum of Modern Art, in 1977. He went on to exhibit in one-person and group exhibitions at Whitney Museum of American Art, Centre Georges Pompidou, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. His work is in many international museum collections. Ollman was one of the founding members of the board of directors for San Francisco Camerawork and served as chairman of the board from 1979 to 1983. There he curated exhibitions of many well-known figures in contemporary photography. In 1976, he created The Photo History Video Project, producing oral historical video interviews with older Western photographers who had not yet been well researched. These included Laura Gilpin, Pirkle Jones and Ruth- Marion Baruch, Jack Welpott, Ruth Bernhard, Walter Chappell, and Edmund Teske. In 1979, Ollman was introduced to Ansel Adams, and the following year Adams asked Ollman to teach at his Ansel Adams Yosemite Workshop. For the next three summers, Ollman taught alongside Adams and some of the most prominent photographers of the day, including Roy DeCarava, Olivia Parker, Marie Cosindas, David Kennerly, and Arnold Newman. In 1983, Ansel Adams recommended Ollman for the position of founding director of The Museum of Photographic Arts slated for San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park. Ollman was hired in November 1982, and the museum opened in May 1983.
