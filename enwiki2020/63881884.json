    "text": "Todd Tilghman of Meridian, Mississippi, is a pastor best known as the winner of the 18th season of American series The Voice. He has the distinction of being the first artist to be aired that season and the first artist to be aired as being unanimously selected by the judges (however, this is not necessarily the case as the auditions are aired out of order). He decided to compete in the team coached by Blake Shelton, proving to do the expected. His voice took him straight to the winners circle. At age 42, he became the oldest winner in the series history, a record previously held by Josh Kaufman. ==Personal life== Tilghman has been singing in church since he was eight years old. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Brooke, and is the father of eight children. Since 2011, he has been the lead pastor of Cornerstone Church in Meridian. Tilghman's eldest son, Eagan Tilghman, was a contestant on NBC's Making It (TV series). ==The Voice== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;text-align:center;\" |- ! Stage ! Date ! Song !
