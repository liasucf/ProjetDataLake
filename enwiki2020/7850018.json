    "text": "1802 was the 16th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Cricket by this time was being heavily impacted by the Napoleonic War. E. H. Budd, who went on to become one of the most famous batsmen of the early 19th century, made his debut in important matches.Haygarth, pages 293 to 303. ==Events== Cricket was continuing to feel the impact of Great Britain's war against the Napoleonic Empire through a loss of investment which for many years reduced the number of important matches. MCC, based at Lord's Old Ground continued to play the leading role in the sport. Several matches took place involving the more prominent \"town clubs\" such as Homerton, Montpelier, Richmond and Woolwich. A \"recent discovery\" by the ACS is the match at Lord's on 8 June between Charles Lennox's XI and George Leycester's XI.Britcher, page 4.Lennox v Leycester scorecard at ESPNcricinfo ==Debutants== * Abbott (Lord Frederick Beauclerk's XI * E. H. Budd (MCC) * Harry Hampton (Kent) ==Leading players== Scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the known totals and computation of averages is ineffectual. According to the surviving sources, the leading run-scorer and wicket-taker was Lord Frederick Beauclerk. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:1802 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1787 to 1815 ",
