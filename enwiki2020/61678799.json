The film features Santhosh, Srisha and Ashwini in lead roles, with Karunas, Vaiyapuri, Manivannan, Ravikumar, Chithra and Bharathi playing supporting roles. The film, produced by Salai Maitri, had musical score by G. Ram and was released on 25 February 2005. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Preminchaka. ==Plot== For misinterpreting a friendly relationship with a girl to be a love affair, the college student Santhosh (Santhosh) gets a punishment from the court: to read Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography for a week in the Mother Teresa's library. A few months later, Santhosh joins a college in Chennai. Nithika (Srisha), a studious student and a social worker, is attracted by his attitude and she falls in love with him. Santhosh likes her too but he has only one thing in mind: having sex with her. They fall in love with each other and start dating each other. One day, Santhosh tries to have sex with Nithika in his home but Nithika, who strongly believes that premarital sex is taboo, insults him and runs away. A few months ago, Santhosh was a dedicated student in Coimbatore, he had the ambition to study aeronautics and to become a pilot. He and his collegemate Subha (Ashwini) fell in love with each other. One day, Subha wanted to have sex with him but he refused. He explained to her that love should be pure and sex should be only after the marriage. For his love, he made several sacrifices including not going to an aeronautics training. Thereafter, Subha announced to him that she will marry a wealthy NRI and explained that their love wasn't strong enough (because they didn't have sexual intercourse). He created a ruckus at the registrar's office and Subha lied by saying that they were just friends. The police then arrested Santhosh hence the punishment to read Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography. Back to the present, Santhosh tries to reconcile with Nithika but she tells him that he is \"unfit\" for love. Santhosh then meets Subha, she tells him that her husband divorced her when she got breast cancer. She apologizes to him for her mistakes and she is now working in an ashram. Santhosh and Nithika finally understand their feelings, and they make up after their quarrel. ==Cast== *Santhosh as Santhosh *Srisha as Nithika *Ashwini (Aswitha) as Subha *Karunas as Odibaba Ulaganathan *Vaiyapuri as Dharma *Manivannan as Nithika's father *Ravikumar as Santhosh's father *Chithra as Nithika's mother *Bharathi as Santhosh's mother *Sangeetha Balan as Flower seller *Sabitha *Sundari *Baby Shathiga as Sowmya *Balu Anand as Traffic police Palanisamy *Muthukaalai as Mechanic *Bava Lakshmanan as Pongal Perumal *Ravi Shanth as Dharman *Nakkheeran as Nakkheeran *Bayilvan Ranganathan *Omakuchi Narasimhan *Rajkrishnan *Theni Murugan *Vijay Ganesh as Tea master *Suja Varunee in a special appearance ==Production== Ravi Bhargavan who made his directorial debut with Well Done (2003), returned with Kadhal Seiya Virumbu under the banner of Vision 21 Creative Team Works.

Ashwini who was credited as Aswitha in this film was selected to play the second heroine. ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer G. Ram. The soundtrack features 5 tracks. ==Reception== Sify described it as \"a crass film which depends mainly on its heroine Srisha's anatomy and can be classified as a soft-porn movie\" and concluded, \"the message from the film is regressive\". A reviewer wrote, \"to drive home the point that premarital sex is wrong, the director bores you to tears\" and added, \"Music by G. Ram and cinematography by Salai Sahadevan is the only saving grace of the film\". Another critic called the film \"average\" and praised the music. ==References== Category:2005 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:2000s erotic drama films Category:2005 romantic drama films Category:Indian erotic romance films Category:Indian erotic drama films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:2005 drama films ",
