    "text": "The Mendip UHF television mast The Mendip transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility on the summit of Pen Hill, part of the Mendip Hills range in Somerset, England, at above sea level. The station is in St Cuthbert Out civil parish in Mendip district, approximately northeast of the centre of Wells. It has a tall mast, which was built in 1967 and weighs around 500 tonnes, and is the tallest structure in South West England. The mast broadcasts digital television, FM analogue radio and DAB digital radio, and had broadcast analogue colour television from 1967 until 2010. It has become a Mendip landmark, providing a method of identifying the hills from a distance. == Description == The station is owned and operated by Arqiva (which acquired National Grid Wireless, previously Crown Castle). Until 2008 a GRP aerial cylinder, containing the analogue television transmitting antennas, was mounted at the top of the mast, bringing the total height of the structure to . With a mean height of above sea level, these antennas were among the highest in the UK. They were removed in 2010, the antenna cylinder being replaced with a new antenna assembly, ready for digital switchover later that year. The present assembly is slightly shorter than the previous cylinder, causing the overall mast height to be reduced from to . There are red aircraft warning lamps (six sets of two lights) on the mast and two lights on top. The lights were upgraded in February 2007http://www.cheddarvalleygazette.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=216909&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=216903&contentPK;=16636764&moduleName;=InternalSearch&formname;=filtersearch to comply with CAA 2000 Air Navigation Order, designed to prevent low flying aircraft from hitting the mast. The mast was repainted during 2007. The mast can be seen from as far away as Puriton during the day and the red aircraft warning lights make it visible at night from pretty much anywhere on the Somerset Levels. ==Television== Mendip was set up as a C/D group transmitter when it entered service with analogue PAL transmissions. In July 2007, Ofcom confirmed that it would remain a C/D group transmitter at digital switchover. The mast broadcasts digital television over a large area of the west of England, including Somerset, Wiltshire, North Somerset, Bath and North-East Somerset, Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Southern Gloucestershire, Northern Dorset and East Devon. The station also covers the coastal areas of south east Wales, and in the days of analogue TV, many households used it in preference to their more local station, Wenvoe. This is because prior to the digital switchover, Mendip carried Channel 4 and Channel 5, whereas Wenvoe only carried S4C, which broadcast a lot of Welsh language programming. Power on analogue transmissions was 500 kW (erp) on channels 1 to 4, and 126 kW on Channel 5. The latter was transmitted outside of the original C/D grouping of the transmitter but most people in reasonable signal areas could receive it. All six digital multiplexes were transmitted at 10 kW until switchover in 2010 when the power on the \"BBC A\", \"BBC B/HD\" and \"D3&4\" multiplexes was boosted to 100 kW. In 2011, SDN was boosted to 50 kW and in 2012 the remaining two Arqiva multiplexes were boosted to 50 kW too. In June 2019, as part of the 700MHz clearance, Mendip became a K group (excluding MUXES 7 and 8, which are due to be switched off between 2020 and 2022 anyway). This means those who still have C/D group aerial may struggle to receive all channels, particularly if the site is in a poor signal area (see Mendip graph). Mendip's population coverage is around 1.5 million, although some homes in the immediate vicinity, such as those in Cheddar, are unable to receive a signal due to being in the shadow of the Mendip Hills and therefore depend on local relays. ==Radio== Mendip broadcasts FM (analogue VHF) radio for BBC Somerset and the Severn Estuary regional service Kiss 101. It transmits high power Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) signals for Digital One and BBC National DAB multiplexes, and until 2013 transmitted a lower power local service to Glastonbury for MXR Severn Estuary. These three multiplexes carry approximately ten digital radio stations each. An additional DAB multiplex, MuxCo Somerset, was awarded a licence in 2008 to broadcast local and national services to Somerset, and began transmission in 2014. ==Output== ===Radio=== ====Analogue==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !kWRadio Listeners Guide 2010 !Service |- |95.5 MHz |5 |BBC Somerset |- |101.0 MHz |40 |Kiss 101 |- |102.6 MHz |4 |Heart Somerset |} ====Digital==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !Block !kWRadio Listeners Guide 2010 !Operator |- |211.648 MHz |10B |1.2 |MuxCo Somerset |- |216.928 MHz |11A | |Sound Digital Limited |- |222.064 MHz |11D |5 |Digital One |- |225.648 MHz |12B |5 |BBC National DAB |- |227.360 MHz |12C |1.25 |South East Wales |} ===Television=== ====Analogue==== =====1 December 1969 \u2013 11 May 1970===== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !UHF !kW !Service |- | |64 |500 |BBC2 |} =====11 May 1970 \u2013 30 May 1970===== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !UHF !kW !Service |- | |58 |500 |BBC1 |- | |64 |500 |BBC2 |} =====30 May 1970 \u2013 2 November 1982===== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !UHF !kW !Service |- | |58 |500 |BBC1 |- | |61 |500 |HTV West |- | |64 |500 |BBC2 |} =====2 November 1982 \u2013 30 March 1997===== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !UHF !kW !Service |- | |54 |500 |Channel 4 |- | |58 |500 |BBC1 |- | |61 |500 |HTV West |- | |64 |500 |BBC2 |} =====30 March 1997 \u2013 15 November 1998===== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Frequency !UHF !kW !Service |- | |37 |126 |Channel 5 |- | |54 |500 |Channel 4 |- | |58 |500 |BBC One |- | |61 |500 |HTV West |- | |64 |500 |BBC Two |} ====Analogue and digital==== =====15 November 1998 \u2013 24 March 2010===== Digital terrestrial television was first transmitted from the Mendip mast from 15 November 1998 using the frequency gaps between the analogue TV broadcasts.
