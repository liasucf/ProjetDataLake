    "text": "is a Japanese Foundation with an important collection of Japanese and Chinese art, in particular ceramics, calligraphic works, and paintings. Established by Sugawara Ts\u016bsai in 1954, this includes two National Treasures, twenty-three Important Cultural Properties (six paintings, sixteen calligraphic works/old documents/classical texts, one Muromachi-period red lacquered bowl), and eighteen Important Art Objects. Sugawara Ts\u016bsai (1894\u20131981) started collecting in 1943 and in 1954 established the Tokiwayama Bunko Foundation, named after and located in the area of Kamakura where he had his private residence. Initially this was opened to the public, but amendments to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties have necessitated its closure. Tokiwayama Bunko now exhibits and loans its works at and to other institutions in Japan and overseas, in particular the Kamakura Museum of National Treasures and Tokyo National Museum, as well as making materials available for academic purposes. In recent years there has been a particular emphasis on research and publications relating to Chinese ceramics. ==See also== * List of National Treasures of Japan (writings: others) * List of Cultural Properties of Japan - paintings (Kanagawa) * Kanazawa Bunko ==References== ==External links== * Tokiwayama Bunko Category:Cultural organizations based in Japan Category:1954 establishments in Japan ",
