Reportedly, a physician, a masseur and a dietician were monitoring him throughout the match. He said he would have put in the same zeal even if the previous title holder was a non-Israeli. \"Iran is great and deserves the best. Let's not talk politics... even if this record was held by another person, I would have gone all out to break it,\" he said after the matches when asked about ousting Israeli Alik Gershon. ==Chess career== In October 2011, Ehsan Ghaem-Maghami was expelled from the Corsica Masters in Bastia, France for refusing to play in his scheduled match against Israeli player Ehud Shachar. Ghaem-Maghami told organizers he would not play the Israeli for political reasons. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which refuses to recognize the existence of the Jewish state, has long refused to engage in sports competition against Israel. In 2013 he played against British Grandmaster Nigel Short in his native homeland. ==References== ==External links== * *OlimpBase Category:Iranian chess players Category:Chess grandmasters Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Iran Category:Asian Games medalists in chess Category:Chess players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Chess players at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games ",
