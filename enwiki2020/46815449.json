    "text": "The Paterson and Ramapo Railroad was a railroad that operated mostly in New Jersey, connecting the city of and Paterson, New Jersey with Suffern, New York, just across the state line. The railroad was chartered in 1841 and construction began in 1847. It was created to form a connection between the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad, one of the earliest railroads in the United States, and the Erie Railroad in Suffern. The two Paterson railroads provided a shorter route from Suffern to New York City than did the New York and Erie Railroad. The road served freight customers from the beginning, notably cotton mills in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. Several other factories, including a paper mill, were built due to the railroad. The railroad opened in fall, 1849.The Hermitage Museum -- Paterson & Ramapo Railroad (Accessed May 27, 2015). The steam locomotives to operate on the line were ordered from Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works in Paterson. In 1852, the New York and Erie Railroad leased the track rights of the P&HR; and P&R; and made their lines the new New York and Erie Railroad mainline.Erie Railroad Home Page (Erie Lackawanna Historical Society) (Accessed November 30, 2008.) It added a third rail to make a track as well. == References == Category:Defunct New Jersey railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1841 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1852 Category:Defunct public transport operators in the United States Category:Predecessors of the Erie Railroad Category:American companies established in 1841 Category:American companies disestablished in 1852 ",
