The album features guest appearances from Quavo, Future, 2 Chainz, Juicy J, Kacy Hill, The Weeknd, Swae Lee, Chief Keef, Kanye West, Justin Bieber, Young Thug, Toro y Moi and Schoolboy Q, while the production was provided by Scott himself, alongside several high-profile record producers such as Allen Ritter, Mike Dean, Metro Boomin, Frank Dukes, Sonny Digital and WondaGurl, among others. Rodeo was supported by two singles: \"3500\" and \"Antidote\". The latter became his highest-charting single in the US Billboard Hot 100 at the time, peaking at number 16. The album received generally favorable reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200. In May 2017, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ==Background== Travis Scott announced the release date for Rodeo through social media on July 17, 2015. In the CR Fashion Book, Scott stated his life was like a rodeo and he feels like he is trying to stay on a bucking animal: == Promotion == On January 26, 2015, to support the album, Scott announced he would embark on The Rodeo Tour with Young Thug and Metro Boomin. On January 27, the following day, Scott released two new songs; \"High Fashion\" featuring Future, and \"Nothing But Net\" featuring Young Thug and PartyNextDoor. However, neither of them ended up being on the final version of the album. On June 12, 2015, a track titled \"Drunk\" featuring Young Thug, leaked online. ===Singles=== On June 8, 2015, Scott released the album's lead single, \"3500\", which features guest appearances from American rappers Future and 2 Chainz. It peaked at number 82 on the US Billboard Hot 100. On July 29, 2015, Scott released the album's second single, \"Antidote\". The song peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. On January 31, 2019, the song was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ==Critical reception== Rodeo was met with generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 15 reviews. Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as 62 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. Roger Krastz of XXL stated, \"Overall, Rodeo has plenty of bangers and noteworthy collaborations that help bring out a fantastic trap sound that could bleed into the mainstream of hip-hop in no time.\" Jason Bisnoff of HipHopDX stated, \"Rodeos back end after \"Antidote\" begin to mesh together and gets repetitive.... Nonetheless, the originality of Scott's sound within this new movement provides for a strong rookie effort leaving the listener excited for a career that is just getting started.\" Trazier Tharpe of Complex stated, \"Travis Scott made an enjoyable album for his fans peppered with undeniable bangers for his detractors.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, \"With Rodeo, Travis Scott becomes a designer drug.\" Steve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews stated, \"Somewhere beneath all the hype and production he does shine through.\" Martin Caballero of The Boston Globe stated, \"His versatility, combined with a high-profile guest list, conspires against him; among 14 tracks, Scott conjures just a handful of moments that hint at untapped reserves of talent.\" Matthew Cooper of Clash stated, \"Yes, the production is razor sharp, the beats are skewed and often very loud which makes them feel important, but in reality, it's all a fa\u00e7ade; an image.\" Kevin Ritchie of Now stated, \"Scott goes for spacey sounds, stoner vibes and vocal filters, but despite the eclecticism, he's too elusive and bland for Rodeo to amount to a stylistic-- let alone a subversive--statement.\" Sheldon Pearce from Pitchfork stated, \"He is most effective when he harshly distorts his vocals to create texture, and in the company of others he can serve as a welcome change of pace.\" David Turner from Rolling Stone stated, \"Left on his own, Scott can grow tiresome. \"I Can Tell\" sounds monochromatic without another voice to push this astute curator. Some rock stars are better leading bands than going solo.\" Matthew Ramirez of Spin stated, \"This is a cold, calculated record lacking in personality, though it certainly tries to deliver something that Scott is incapable of.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Year-end lists |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| Accolade ! scope=\"col\"| Rank ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Clash | Albums of the Year 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Complex | Best Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| HipHopDX | The Top 25 Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Pigeons & Planes | Best Albums of 2015 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| XXL | 20 of the Best Albums of 2015 | | |} == Commercial performance == Rodeo debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, moving 85,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 are pure album sales.
