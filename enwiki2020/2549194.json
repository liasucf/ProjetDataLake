    "text": "NGC 1300 is a barred spiral galaxy located about 61 million light-years away in the constellation Eridanus. The galaxy is about 110,000 light-years across (about the same size of the Milky Way). It is a member of the Eridanus Cluster, a cluster of 200 galaxies. It was discovered by John Herschel in 1835. == Nucleus == In the core of the larger spiral structure of NGC 1300, the nucleus shows a \"grand-design\" spiral structure that is about 3,300 light- years long. Only galaxies with large-scale bars appear to have these grand- design inner disks \u2014 a spiral within a spiral. Models suggest that the gas in a bar can be funneled inwards, and then spiral into the center through the grand-design disk, where it can potentially fuel a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). NGC 1300 is not known to have an active nucleus, indicating that its central black hole is not accreting matter. The SMBH has a mass of . ==See also== *NGC 1672, a similar spiral galaxy *NGC 7479, a galaxy with a very similar structure and both size and morphology similar *NGC 1232, a nearby intermediate spiral galaxy ==References== ==External links== *HST: Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1300 *Hubble Heritage * *Best of AOP: NGC 1300 - Barred Spiral in Eridanus Category:Barred spiral galaxies Category:Eridanus Group Category:Eridanus (constellation) 1300 12412 Category:UGCA objects ",
