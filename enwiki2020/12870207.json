She hired him to work for her at Rookwood in May, 1887. A vase he made won a Grand Prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. The vase was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1901 and is still in its collection. He decorated table lamp bases that were combined with stained glass shades made by Tiffany Studios, and one such lamp is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ==Museum collections== His work is in many museum collections, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Mint Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Crocker Art Museum. ==Legacy== In 1991 one of his pieces from 1900 sold for $198,000.
