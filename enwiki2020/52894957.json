    "text": "Annie Sloan (born 19 June 1949) is a British artist, colour expert and author. After studying Fine Art at university in the 1970s, Annie Sloan went on to write several books on traditional paints and decorative painting techniques, starting with The Complete Book of Decorative Paint Techniques in 1988. She developed her own line of decorative paint \"Chalk Paint\" in 1990. == Career == Following seven years of studying Fine Art in England, Annie Sloan turned her attention to decorative painting. Her first book, The Complete Book of Decorative Paint Techniques, was co-authored with Kate Gwynn and published in 1988. The success of the book launched her career as a decorative paint expert and led to opportunities to teach decorative painting techniques internationally. Annie Sloan then went on to develop her own brand of paint \"Chalk Paint\" in 1990. Initially the paint was manufactured in Belgium. She opened her first shop in Headington, Oxford, in 2000, a base from which she could sell her paint, as well as fabrics and ready-painted furniture. Her book \"Colour Recipes for Painted Furniture and More\" was published by CICO Books in 2013. This was followed by \"Room Recipes for Style and Colour\" in 2014. In 2015, Annie Sloan introduced a second brand of paint, called \"Wall Paint\", in Europe. Her business is based in Oxford, England, which she runs with her husband, David. In 2017, Annie Sloan entered into a partnership with Oxfam to create a new colour called Lem Lem, inspired by Oxfam's Ethiopian Seed Project. == Bibliography == * \"The Complete Book of Decorative Paint Techniques: An Inspirational Sourcebook of Paint Finishes and Interior Decoration\", Ebury Press (, 1988) * \"Nursery Style: Creating Beautiful Rooms for Children\", with Felicity Bryan.
