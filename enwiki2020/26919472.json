They played nine games with a final record of 7\u20131\u20131. The team captain for the 1895 season was Edwin Gregory. The team went 3\u20130\u20131 on a 6-day, 4 game road trip. ==Schedule== ==Season summary== ===North Carolina A&M;=== The season opened with a defeat of the rival A and M college by a 36\u20130 score Nicklin had runs of 57, 67, and 80 yards. The starting lineup was Gregory (left end), Steele (left tackle), Hurley (left guard), White (center), Collier (right guard), Wright (right tackle), Merritt (right ed), Whitaker (quarterback), Nicklin (left halfback), Moore (right halfback), McRae (fullback). ===Richmond=== The Tar Heels beat the winless Richmond Spiders 34\u20130. Pop Warner on the Georgia sidelines. ===Georgia=== The Georgia Bulldogs, coached by Pop Warner, were defeated 6\u20130 what some claim is the very first (legal or otherwise; the legal pass starts in 1906) forward pass. Bob Quincy notes in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime: \"John Heisman, a noted historian, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6\u20130 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.\" The ball was thrown out of desperation by back Dr. Joel Whitaker. Georgia coach Pop Warner complained to the referee that the play was illegal, however, the referee let the play stand because he did not see the pass. Only 4 minutes of game time had passed when Stephens scored. Governor William Y. Atkinson attended the game. ===Vanderbilt=== Carolina outcoached Vanderbilt on its way to a 12\u20130 victory. Butler had a punt return for a touchdown. The game was called due to darkness. ===Sewanee=== The Sewanee Tigers fought UNC to a scoreless tie. ===Georgia again=== The Georgia and Carolina teams played a second time to round out the road trip and North Carolina won 10\u20136. ===Washington and Lee=== The Tar Heels defeated Washington and Lee Generals 16\u20130. ===VAMC=== North Carolina beat VAMC in Charlotte, North Carolina with 1,000 looking on. North Carolina scored three touchdowns in the first half and then scored two more touchdowns in the second half. VAMC then drove to North Carolina's three-yard line, but was stopped on downs. The final score was 5\u201332. The starting lineup was Gregory (left end), Wright (left tackle), Hurley (left guard), White (center), Collier (right guard), Baird (right tackle), Merritt (right ed), Stanley (quarterback), Nicklin (left halfback), Moore (right halfback), Butler (fullback). ===Virginia=== Virginia defeated North Carolina 10\u20136 in this year's version of the South's Oldest Rivalry.
