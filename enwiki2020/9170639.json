    "text": "Everybody Sing is a 1938 American musical comedy film starring Allan Jones, Judy Garland, and Fanny Brice, and featuring Reginald Owen and Billie Burke. The film was a significant step in Garland's career. ==Plot== Young Judy Bellaire (Judy Garland) has trouble fitting in at school, causing trouble by introducing her jazzy style into music class and being expelled as a result. Returning home to her dysfunctional and financially challenged family, where her frustrated playwright-father (Reginald Owen), ditzy actress-mother (Billie Burke), and beautiful elder sister, Sylvia (Lynne Carver) compete for attention along with the funny Russian maid, Olga (Fanny Brice) and the hunky singing cook, Ricky (Allan Jones), who is not-so-secretly in love with Sylvia. Judy foils her father's attempt to ship her off to Europe by escaping from the ship and then trying out for a musical show as a blackface singer, taking advantage of her love of jazz to enchant the show's producer, who hires her and makes her a star of his new show. Meanwhile, Ricky cuts a record, musically expressing his love for Sylvia. Nevertheless, Sylvia is forced into engagement with another man. When the distraught parents discover their younger daughter is appearing in a musical show, Sylvia rejoins her love, who is also appearing in the show. Finally, all the cast members are reunited, including Olga, who finds her lost love, Boris. The movie's happy ending includes an extravagant stage piece with gorgeously attired chorus girls, happily reunited parents and child, and the happy kiss between Sylvia and Ricky, who is now the producer of a successful musical show. ==Cast== *Allan Jones as Richard \"Ricky\" Saboni *Judy Garland as Judy Bellaire *Fanny Brice as Olga Chekaloff *Reginald Owen as Hillary Bellaire *Billie Burke as Diana Bellaire *Reginald Gardiner as Jerrold Hope *Lynne Carver as Sylvia Bellaire *Helen Troy as Hillary's secretary *Monty Woolley as John \"Jack\" Fleming *Adia Kuznetzoff |as Boris, the bus driver *Henry Armetta as Signor Giovanni Vittorino, Cafe Nappo *Michelette Burani as Madame Le Brouchette *Mary Forbes as Miss Colvin Cast notes * Everybody Sing is the final film Allan Jones appeared in for MGM, and the first MGM contract film for Monty Woolley. ==Music== Allan Jones introduces in Everybody Sing the pop standard \"The One I Love\", with lyrics by Gus Kahn and music by Bronis\u0142aw Kaper and Walter Jurmann.

The music and lyrics for \"Quainty, Dainty Me\" and \"Snooks (Why? Because!)\" are by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. The \"Snooks\" number is based on the character \"Baby Snooks\" played on Broadway and on the radio by Brice.
