The name, written as Birklinge, was used for the parish as early as 1314, and Norsemen graves have been found in the area. Bj\u00f6rklinge is situated on a glacial ridge next to lake L\u00e5ngsj\u00f6n. European route E4 passed through the village until the new motorway east of Bj\u00f6rklinge was opened for traffic on October 17, 2007. Bj\u00f6rklinge church, which was first built in the early 14th century and re-built in the 17th century, is in the centre of the village. The spelman Anders Ljungqvist, called \"G\u00e5s-Anders\" (Anders of the geese), lived in Bj\u00f6rklinge most of his life. There is a statue of him, created by the artist Bror Hjorth, standing next to the church. Bror Hjorth had a summer cottage by L\u00e5ngsj\u00f6n. == References == ==See also== *Bj\u00f6rklinge runestones Category:Populated places in Uppsala County Category:Populated places in Uppsala Municipality ",
