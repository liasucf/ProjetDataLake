It contained all the members of the Navy Board and various other departments and offices. The day-to-day business of the Navy Office was administered by Clerk of the Acts from 1660 until 1796, who was responsible for the organisation of the office and management of its staff. When his office was abolished his duties were assumed by separate committees for Accounts, Correspondence, Stores, Transports and Victualling who were, in turn, presided over by the Comptroller of the Navy until 1832. It was one of two government offices (the other being the Department of Admiralty) that were jointly responsible for directing naval affairs. In 1832 following reforms of the naval service the Navy Office was abolished all of its functions and staff were merged within the Admiralty. ==History== In 1576 the Navy Office replaced the Office of the Council of the Marine. It was initially located at Deptford for most of the sixteenth century. It later moved to collection of offices in the Tower Hill area of London until around 1654. The office then moved to a new building at the crossroad of Crutched Friars and Seething Lane. Until 1628 following the creation of the Board of Admiralty the Navy Office was an independent advisory office to the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office when it became a subsidiary yet autonomous component of that office. In 1673 the office was destroyed by a fire and a new building was constructed to house its staff that took 10 years to complete. The Navy Office continued to be based in Tower Hill until 1786 when it relocated to a much large office space at Somerset House where it remained until it was abolished in 1832. The primary organisation within the office was the Navy Board and the various offices of its principal commissioners. However, the Treasurer of the Navy although a principal member of the board administered a separate Navy Pay Office. From 1567 until 1660 the office was administered by the Comptroller of the Navy. In 1660 the Clerk of the Acts became responsible for the organisation of the Navy Office. In 1796 administration of the Navy Office was placed under the supervision of three Committees, of Correspondence, Accounts and Stores. Throughout its history its clerical supporting staff consisting of chief clerks then first, second and third class clerks were assigned to the various offices and departments within the Navy Office. In 1808 the Naval Works Department was relocated from the Admiralty to the Navy Office. A Ticket and Wages Branch was formed in 1829. In 1832 the Navy Office and subsequently the Navy Board were abolished its functions were then transferred to the Department of Admiralty under supervision of the Board of Admiralty. ==Organisation and structure of the Navy Office== The Navy Office provided accommodation for the Commissioners of the Navy Board and senior clerical and secretarial staff, as well as office space. Different branches, departments and offices were located within different parts of the Navy Office in London, England. Royal Navy Dockyards both in the United Kingdom and overseas were also part of this office. ===Components of the Navy Office=== The Navy Office consisted of a number of specific component parts that included: ====Boards==== The Navy Board and formerly known as the Council of the Marine or Council of the Marine Causes was the organisation with responsibility for the day-to-day civil administration of the Royal Navy between 1546 and 1832.
