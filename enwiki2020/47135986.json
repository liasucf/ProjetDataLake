    "text": "Al Kharrara (; also spelled Al Harrarah) is a village in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al Wakrah. The closest sizable city is Mesaieed, located to the east. It is a desert area, characterized by high aridity and the presence of grazing animals such as dromedary camels, goats and sheep. ==Etymology== The village's name comes from the Arabic \"khar\", which roughly means \"the sound of running water\". As the area consists of varying elevations and several hills, the process of surface runoff is very noticeable during the wet months. ==Geography== Al Kharrara is situated in south-central Qatar. The villages of Al Aamriya and Umm Hawta in Al Rayyan Municipality are nearby to the west. ==History== According to Richard H. Curtiss of the Washington Report, inscriptions dedicated to the pre-Islamic Nabataean god Man\u0101t were found in Al Kharrara. In J.G. Lorimer's 1908 publication Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, he refers Al Kharrara as a Bedouin outpost that lies \"20 miles south of Dohah and 6 from the east coast, between Naqiy\u0101n and Jabalat-at- Tuwar\". He noted the presence of a masonry well, 27 fathoms deep, containing good water. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. ==Industry== The Qatar Primary Materials Company has centered its dune sand extraction operations here due to the area's relatively large deposits. ==Sports== The second stage of the Sealine Cross-Country Rally, which runs for 345.89 km, starts in Al Kharrara and ends in Sealine Beach (a section of Mesaieed). ==Gallery== File:Small farm in Al Kharrarah.jpg|Small farm with blooming fennel in Al Kharrara Limestone arch in Al Kharrara.jpg|Limestone arch in Al Kharrara View of Al Kharrara from a mountain slope.jpg|View of Al Kharrara from a mountain slope Uromastyx aegyptia near its burrow in Al Kharrara.jpg|A dhub (Uromastyx aegyptia) near its burrow in Al Kharrara Water well in Al Kharrara.jpg|Old water well in Al Kharrara ==References== Category:Populated places in Al Wakrah ",
