    "text": "The Siege of Roses (or Siege of Rosas) began on 28 November 1794 and lasted until 4 February 1795 when the Spanish garrison abandoned the port and the forces of the First French Republic took control. Dominique Catherine de P\u00e9rignon commanded the French army and Domingo Salvator Izquierdo led the Spanish defenders. The siege took place during the War of the Pyrenees which was part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The war ended in July 1795 and Roses was soon restored to Spain. Roses is a coastal city in northeastern Spain, located northeast of Girona, Catalonia. The French inflicted a severe defeat on the Spanish army at the Black Mountain in November 1794. In the aftermath, the French army quickly captured Figueras and its fortress. At the same time, they undertook a formal siege of Roses. P\u00e9rignon and his lieutenant Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Sauret soon realized that an outlying fort was the key to Roses and concentrated their energy on reducing it. A month after the fort fell, the Spanish fleet evacuated the garrison by sea. ==Background== On 17 November 1794, the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees under General of Division Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Dugommier attacked Lieutenant General Luis Firmin de Carvajal, Conde de la Union's Spanish army in the Battle of the Black Mountain. The French army routed their adversaries in a four-day combat in which both commanding generals were killed. General of Division Dominique Catherine de P\u00e9rignon assumed command of the French army and quickly occupied the city of Figueres. The French general bluffed Brigadier General Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s Valdes into surrendering the 9,000-man garrison of Sant Ferran Castle on 28 November. On the same day, General of Division Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Sauret invested the port of Roses.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 408Smith (1998), 96 ==Siege== ===Forces=== The defenses of Roses consisted of a Vauban-type citadel (Ciutadella de Roses) and the Castell de la Trinitat. These fortifications were ordered by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1543 and completed by 1570. The citadel had a modified pentagonal shape with five bastions and demi-lunes on all sides except the sea side. The Castillo de la Trinidad was a 4-pointed star-shaped work on a height.Goode (2010), Roses The citadel is located just west of the town while the castillo crowns a promontory 2.3 km south-southeast of the citadel.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 415 map The 300-meter high Mont Puy- Bois dominated the Castillo on the northeast. Lieutenant General Domingo Salvator Izquierdo commanded the 4,800 men of the Spanish garrison. Admiral Federico Carlos Gravina y Napoli's fleet of 13 ships of the line and 45 other vessels lay in the Bay of Roses. These ships provided gunfire and logistic support to the garrison.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 413 On 28 November the French invested Roses with 13,261 soldiers. While Sauret had immediate command over the besiegers, P\u00e9rignon remained the driving force in prosecuting the siege. Six brigades were subordinated to Sauret for the operation. The brigades were commanded by Generals of Brigade Claude Perrin Victor (2,455 infantry), Joseph Magdelaine Martin (1,747 infantry), Robert Motte (1,799 infantry), Jean-Jacques Causse (1,403 infantry), Th\u00e9odore Chabert (2,118 infantry), and Fran\u00e7ois Gilles Guillot (1,019 infantry and 123 cavalry). General of Division Jean Baptiste Beaufort de Thorigny's 2,586 infantry and 211 cavalry were in support at Castillon.Smith (1998), 102Prats (2007), Le Bluff. Prats placed Abel Joseph Guillot in Sauret's division.Mulli\u00e9, Guillot. This source stated that Fran\u00e7ois Gilles Guillot served in the Eastern Pyrenees and was wounded on 20 November 1794 (that is, at the Battle of the Black Mountain). ===Action=== Dominique P\u00e9rignon On 29 November, the first battery opened fire on the fortress and the French began digging siege trenches. By 7 December, six batteries were pounding the defenses. Izquierdo launched several ineffectual sorties at the French as their siege parallels drew closer to the citadel. By this time P\u00e9rignon realized that the Castillo de la Trinidad, whose fire caused serious damage to the besiegers, was the key position. He ordered that heavy guns be installed on Mont Puy-Bois. When the French engineers protested that it could not be done, the commanding general overrode their objections. The French soldiers, whose nickname for the Castillo was le Bouton de Rose (the Pimple), managed to haul three batteries to the summit by 25 December. The batteries on Mont Puy-Bois finally breached the walls of the Castillo and its garrison was taken off in boats on 1 January. From the newly captured position, the French opened fire on the citadel and the fleet. Meanwhile, the army of Lieutenant General Jos\u00e9 de Urrutia y de las Casas held a position behind the Rio Fluvi\u00e0 to the south of Roses, threatening to advance to its relief. By 25 January, when wintry weather compelled Sauret to suspend siege operations, Urrutia's army had grown menacingly large. Determined to take the fortress, P\u00e9rignon decided to try bluff again. He stormed the Spanish advanced positions on 1 February. The French army commander staged obvious preparations for a full-scale assault, such as the display of scaling ladders in the trenches. This finally broke the morale of the defenders. Izquierdo ordered the surviving members of the garrison to be evacuated by Gravina's squadron on the night of 3 February, leaving a 300-man rear guard behind to cover the operation. The rear guard was supposed to be taken off in small boats in the morning, but they were abandoned by the fleet and became French prisoners.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 413\u2013414 ==Results== The Spanish reported 113 killed, 470 wounded, and 1,160 sick during the siege. In addition, 300 soldiers fell into French hands. French losses are unknown but were claimed to be light. Annoyed that P\u00e9rignon was unable to advance beyond the Fluvi\u00e0, the French government replaced him at the end of May 1795 with General of Division Barth\u00e9lemy Louis Joseph Sch\u00e9rer. Urrutia defeated Sch\u00e9rer at the Battle of Bascara on 14 June. French losses numbered 2,500 while the Spanish army only lost 546 casualties.Smith (1998), 103 The Peace of Basel on 22 July 1795 officially ended the fighting. Spanish forces under Lieutenant General Gregorio Garc\u00eda de la Cuesta won two minor actions at Puigcerd\u00e0 and Bellver de Cerdanya in late July, before news of the peace reached the front.Smith (1998), 104 The Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, in which P\u00e9rignon played a key role, followed on 19 August 1796. By this pact, Spain became an ally of France.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 409 A subsequent Siege of Roses happened in November and December 1808, during the Peninsular War.Smith (1998), 271\u2013272 Previous sieges occurred in 1645 and 1693. ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * * * ==External links== The following reference is an excellent source for the full names of French generals. * Category:Conflicts in 1794 Category:Conflicts in 1795 Category:Sieges of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving France Category:Battles in Catalonia Category:1794 in Europe Category:1795 in Europe Category:18th century in Spain ",
