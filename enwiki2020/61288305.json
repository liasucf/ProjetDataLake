    "text": "Dizem Que Sou Louca (\"They Say I'm Crazy\") is an EP by Brazilian singer Alice Caymmi, released on 11 January 2019. It consists of four different versions of \"Louca\" (\"Crazy\"), a song she had released in 2017 and that was part of the soundtrack of superseries Onde Nascem os Fortes, by Rede Globo: a remastered version, an acoustic version, a remixed version and an a cappella version. The EP was released with a show at Sesc Pompeia, in S\u00e3o Paulo, on the following day of the release's arrival on digital platforms. == Background == The track was originally recorded by Mexican singer Thal\u00eda on her 2005 album El Sexto Sentido, but Caymmi actually first heard it in a cover version by Banda Kitara. Originally, the song would be the closer of her 2018 album Alice, but it ended up excluded from the final track listing and would only be added back as a bonus track of the album's 2019 re-release, in its a cappella version, which was exclusively released prior to the EP at Red Bull's website. \"Louca\" would close the album so that it would contrast with the opening track \"Spiritual\", which opening lines say \"I'm not getting crazy\". The idea of releasing the track was matured throughout 2018, with the original plan having the EP as a Christmas gift for the fans. However, that did not happen. Nevertheless, the idea of allowing fans \"to see different ways of making the same song also, of choosing my favorite form of them\", as the singer put it, was kept. In another interview, she said: About the lyrics, Caymmi said: The acoustic version features Mateo Pirac\u00e9s-Ugarte, from the band Francisco, el Hombre, and it received a clip, which exclusively debuted at the Tenho Mais Discos Que Amigos! website and was recorded at YouTube Space, in Rio de Janeiro. About the partnership, Pirac\u00e9s-Ugarte said: The remixed version was created by DJ J Brasil. By the time of the EP's release, she was already sure of a future release for the same year - it came in May, titled Electra. The EP cover features a photograph by Rafael Di Celio, with art by Camila Camargo and art direction by Caymmi herself. == Track listing == == References == Category:2019 debut EPs ",
