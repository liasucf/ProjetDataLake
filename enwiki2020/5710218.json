People resent this because it is more well connected and integrated with Morena than Sheopur. Even after 13 years of being in Sheopur, transportation with Sheopur is very poor. *Bijaypur is again being neglected in the proposed upgrade of Gwalior light railway from narrow gauge to broad gauge. It is an upgrade that is high demand. *There is no political initiative yet to make it a tourist destination by developing it as an attractive gateway to the nearby Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. ==See also== *Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary *Kwari River *Gird, India, a region of North India *Chambal Division *Sheopur ==References== ==External links== *Sheopur District Category:Cities and towns in Sheopur district ",
