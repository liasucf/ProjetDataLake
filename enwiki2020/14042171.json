    "text": "Recycled is the sixth album from English progressive rock band Nektar. It is a concept album addressing the band members' concerns about the environment. There are only two songs on the album, one for each side, titled simply \"Part One\" and \"Part Two\". \"Part One\" tells the tale of a nightmarish future in which only \"recycled energy\" remains, while \"Part Two\" revolves around more present-day concerns about tourism despoiling untouched wilderness. ==Reception== Allmusic gave the album a mixed retrospective review. They criticized the album as lacking the instrumental prowess, enthusiasm, and band cohesion that the players had shown on Nektar's previous albums. However, they acknowledged that \"What does hold strong is Nektar's ability to conjure up a science-fiction atmosphere through the unorthodox application of percussion, guitar, and keyboards.\" ==Track listing== All songs written and arranged by Nektar. ==Credits== *Roye Albrighton - lead vocals, guitars *Mick Brockett - visual environment *Alan \"Taff\" Freeman - keyboards, backing vocals *Ron Howden - drums, percussion *Derek \"Mo\" Moore - bass, backing vocals ;Additional personnel *Larry Fast - Moog synthesizer *The English Chorale conducted by Robert Howes, arranged by Christian Kolonovits ==References== ==External links== * Recycled at TheNektarProject.com Category:1976 albums Category:Nektar albums ",
