    "text": "SPV GmbH (short for \"Schallplatten Produktion und Vertrieb GmbH\") is a German independent record label. Founded on 1 January 1984, it has slowly grown to be one of the largest independent distributors and record labels worldwide. It has several sub-labels that it produces and distributes, including the labels Steamhammer (heavy metal, hard rock), Long Branch Records (alternative, indie, progressive rock, progressive metal, metalcore), Oblivion (darkwave, gothic), SPV Recordings (pop, rock) and Cash Machine Records (hip hop). ==Artists on Steamhammer== Steamhammer's most successful artists include Sepultura, Arena, Kreator, Rhapsody of Fire, Sodom, Evildead, Angra, Eric Burdon, Blackmore's Night, Whitesnake, Mot\u00f6rhead, Doro, Helloween, Kamelot, Iced Earth, Moonspell, Anne Clark, Vicious Rumors, Saxon, Pro-Pain, Monster Magnet, Type O Negative, Skinny Puppy, MAGNUM, and Judas Priest. ==Artists on Long Branch Records== ==Insolvency== The managing partner, Manfred Sch\u00fctz, decided to submit an application to commence insolvency proceedings on 25 May 2009 \u2013 roughly equivalent to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US and administration in the UK. In response to this, on 27 May 2009, the District Court of Hannover appointed the attorney Manuel Sack as the provisional insolvency administrator. According to Sch\u00fctz, together with Sack, the management of SPV GmbH would not only carry on business operations, but also continue working in the areas of production and distribution in the usual way. After a substantial resizing of its business and a partnership venture agreement with Sony Music, which obtained the rights for some of the German label's main artists and for part of the catalogue, SPV went back into production with a new staff at the end of 2009. ==Distribution== In Greece, the exclusive distribution is being carried out by Infinity Entertainment IKE. ==See also== *List of record labels * List of bands distributed by SPV ==References== Category:German independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1984 Category:Rock record labels Category:Heavy metal record labels Category:IFPI members ",
