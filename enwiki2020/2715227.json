    "text": "Jean Ouimet (born September 3, 1954 in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec) is a Canadian politician from Quebec and the president of Naviga-Cit\u00e9, a multimedia company. He is the former leader of the Parti vert du Qu\u00e9bec, a green party, and now an activist in the sovereigntist and social democratic Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. == Biography == After attending CEGEP in sciences, Jean Ouimet studied mathematics at McGill University and the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al before studying philosophy at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. After five years of university, research in cognitive sciences and complexity followed. An activist in the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the 1970s and in the Parti vert du Qu\u00e9bec in the 1980s, he became the latter's leader in 1989, a role he would hold until the year 1993. He then left to become an adviser on ecology for Jacques Parizeau, then leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly of Quebec. In 2001, after the resignation of Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Lucien Bouchard, Ouimet tried to enlist as a candidate for the party leadership. His ambition was said to be motivated by his desire to spark a debate in the leadership race, which would not happen otherwise, as out of the three possible leadership contenders, Fran\u00e7ois Legault and Pauline Marois withdrew, leaving Bernard Landry unopposed. Ouimet did not gather the necessary number of signatures in time to enter and Landry became leader. Bernard Landry's resignation of 2005 left him the opportunity to try again, one that he seized. He officially issued his candidacy on September 15, 2005 for the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership campaign of 2005. He ran on a series of proposals emphasising wealth redistribution, environmentalism and participatory democracy. He also proposed a collegial structure for the party and ties his vision of sovereignty to an elaboration of a social contract. Ouimet fared poorly in the contest winning 247 votes or 0.2% of ballots cast. == See also == *Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois *Green Party of Quebec *Quebec sovereignty movement *Political ecology *2005 Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership election == External links == *Official website *Biography on official site Category:1954 births Category:Leaders of the Green Party of Quebec Category:Living people Category:People from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield Category:Quebec political party leaders Category:Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois politicians ",
