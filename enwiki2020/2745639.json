The 18th-century Lorraine historian Nicolas Luton Durival (1713\u20131795) was born in Commercy. ==History== Commercy dates back to the 9th century, and at that time its lords were dependent on the bishop of Metz. In 1544 it was besieged by Charles V in person. For some time the lordship was in the hands of Jean Fran\u00e7ois Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz, who lived in the town for a number of years, and there composed his memoirs. From him it was purchased by Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine. In 1744 it became the residence of Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, king of Poland, who spent a great deal of care on the embellishment of the town, castle and neighbourhood.
