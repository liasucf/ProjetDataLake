    "text": "The Paleo Foundation is a private American organization that certifies food products related to the Paleolithic and ketogenic diet. == Programs == The organization currently issues a 'Certified Paleo' certification mark, with a previous iteration called \"Paleo Friendly\", for food products and dietary supplements that meet its standards. By 2018, it had certified food products from various food retailers and companies including Whole Foods, Walmart, and General Mills. Recently, the organization also begun certifying food products for its 'Keto Certified' program. == Standards development == In 2015, its founder, Karen Pendergrass, stated that the organization developed its standards for the Paleo diet based on \"current research, archaeological records, paleogenetics, sustainability concerns, proposed health benefits, and input from various leading health experts of the Paleo Movement.\" == Criticism == Many nutrition and law experts have also been critical of such food certification programs, citing fears of arbitrary criteria that lack evidence within the certification standards and the lack of regulation by government agencies. They have since not been investigated. == References == == See also == * Paleolithic diet * Product certification * Certification mark * Mark Sisson == External links == * Official website __FORCETOC__ Category:Certification marks Category:Product testing Category:Product certification Category:Food industry Category:Standards organizations in the United States ",
