    "text": "Andrea Gropa was a 14th-century nobleman who ruled the region and the city of Ohrid, first as a minor vassal (\u017eupan) to Serbian King Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 (r. 1365\u20131371), then as an Ottoman vassal after the Battle of Maritsa. He hailed from the noble Gropa family. ==Life== Andrea was a member of the Albanian Gropa family. His ancestor Paul Gropa was acknowledged by Charles I of Naples in 1273: \"nobili viro sevasto Paulo Gropa \u00bbcasalia Radicis maioris et Radicis minons, \u043fe\u0441 non Cobocheste, Zuadigorica, Sirclani et Craye, Zessizan sitam in valle de Ebu\".Sufflay, p. 126 During the Serbian expansion in Macedonia, the Gropa also moved towards the south, becoming neighbours with Arianiti and Spata.Sufflay 2000, p. 145: \"U vrijeme srpskog prodiranja u Makedoniju pomi\u010du se i Grope prema jugu, postaju susjedi Arianita i Spata, a po smrti kralja Vuka\u0161ina, Andrija Gropa, koji se na gr\u010dkom kamenom natpisu (1378.) naziva megas zupanos (\u017eupan velji)\" After Emperor Du\u0161an's death (1355), Gropa was a local ruler in the district of Ohrid.Soulis 1984, p. 142 Prior to the Battle of Maritsa, Gropa was a vassal to the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 family;Srejovi\u0107, Gavrilovi\u0107, \u0106irkovi\u0107 1982, p. 24 The King of Serbia Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 (r. 1365 \u2013 died 1371), held Western Macedonia as a co-ruler to Emperor Stephen Uro\u0161 V of Serbia (r. 1355 \u2013 died 1371). After the death of King Vuka\u0161in and his brother Jovan Uglje\u0161a at the Battle of Maritsa against the Ottomans in 1371, and the subsequent death of the Emperor, there was a crisis in appointing the successor of the throne. Vuka\u0161in's son, Marko, did not have the power to unite his lords, and only retained nominal rule over the area from his base at Prilep. After Maritsa, the Dejanovi\u0107i became Ottoman vassals.Soulis, p. 100 By 1377, Vuk Brankovi\u0107 extended his rule over Skopje, and Gropa is mentioned as lord of Ohrid.Fine 1994, p. 380: \"By 1377 Vuk Brankovic had Skopje and an Albanian named Andrew Gropa had Ohrid\"Mihalj\u010di\u0107, p. 170: \"\u041d\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0443 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0412\u0443\u043a \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0459\u0435, \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u0458\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430.\" Bogdan, Gropa and Marko, and the rest of the rulers in Western Macedonia became vassals to Murad I.Soulis 1984, p. 100 The vassals had to pay tribute to the Ottoman sultan and supply troops in case of war. Lesser Saint Clement Church - Gropa is mentioned in its ktetor inscription. Gropa is mentioned as megas zupanos (\u017eupan veliki) in a Greek stone inscription dating to 1378. He set himself up as Grand \u017dupan of Ohrid, in southwest Macedonia.Parry;Yapp 1975, p. 167: \"In southwest Macedonia, the Albanian Andrea Gropa (Cropa) set himself up as the 'Grand Zupan' (Prefect) of Ohrid.\" In 1379, he became a ktitor for a church in Ohrid dedicated to St. Clement. Gropa was mentioned as \"\u017eupan Gropa\" in the funeral inscription of his son-in-law Ostoja Rajakovi\u0107 (1380).Mandi\u0107, p. 85: \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0441\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435- \u043d\u0443\u0442 \u0458\u0435, \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u0438 \u0436\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043d \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430, 1380. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0443 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0420\u0430\u0458\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430 V \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0435 \u0443 \u041e\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443 (\u201e\u0437\u0435\u0442 \u0436\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\") According to the Muzaka chronicles, Gropa joined Andrea II Muzaka and the Bal\u0161i\u0107 family against Marko; He gained Kostur and Debar, and became virtually independent from Marko. Gropa also minted coins,American Numismatic Society 1964, p. 293 findings dating to c. 1377 \u2013 c. 1385,Dimitrijevi\u0107 1997, p. 103: \"47. Dinar issued by Zhupan Andrija Gropa (c. 1377 \u2013 c. 1385)\" inscribed in Old Serbian with his title as \u017eupan and gospodar, with his signature as \"Po milosti Bo\u017eijoj \u017eupan Gropa\". He was the last Christian ruler of Ohrid before the Ottoman conquest. His signature is found in the scriptorium of the Church of St. Sofia in Ohrid.Slovansk\u00fd \u00fastav, p. 208: \"Signatures of Andrea Gropa, Tsar Uros, Marko Kralevich and a concept for letter to the archbishop from the scriptorium of St. Sofia Church in Ohrid\" The date of his death is unknown, the Muzaka chronicles says there were no descendants and that his lands were assigned to the Muzaka family after his death, however, the most probable is that they were given to Marko. ==Family== Gropa married Anne (Kyranna), the daughter of Andrea II Muzaka. His brother-in-law was Bal\u0161a II Bal\u0161i\u0107. Gropa's son-in-law was Ostoja Rajakovi\u0107, a lord in Ohrid and relative to Marko.Stanojevi\u0107 1915, Delo, Volume 72, A.M. Stanojevi\u0107, p. 270 ==Legacy== Gropa is, like the other provincial lords of the fall of the Serbian Empire, enumerated in the Serb epic poetry. ==References== ===Sources=== * Marko \u0160uica, \u201eNemirno doba srpskog srednjeg veka\u201c, Beograd, 2000. * \u041c. \u0428\u0443\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u045a\u0435\u0433 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 2001. * \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0436\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043d \u0443 \u041b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u045a\u0435\u0433 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0421. \u040b\u0438\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u0438 \u0420. \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0459\u0447\u0438\u045b, Knowledge, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 1999. * Sergije Dimitrijevi\u0107, Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti, 1997, Srednjovekovni srpski novac *American Numismatic Society., 1964, Numismatic literature, Issues 58-65, p. 293 * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Medieval Ohrid Category:People from medieval Macedonia Category:14th-century Albanian people Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:14th-century rulers in Europe Category:14th-century births Category:14th-century deaths Category:People of the Serbian Empire Andrea Category:Medieval Albanian nobility ",
