    "text": "Dorothy Allison (born April 11, 1949) is an American writer from South Carolina whose writing focuses on class struggle, sexual abuse, child abuse, feminism and lesbianism. She is a self-identified lesbian femme. Allison has won a number of awards for her writing, including several Lambda Literary Awards. In 2014, Allison was elected to membership in the Fellowship of Southern Writers. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Dorothy E. Allison was born on April 11, 1949 in Greenville, South Carolina to Ruth Gibson Allison, who was fifteen at the time. Her father died when she was a baby. Her single mother was poor, working as a waitress and cook. Ruth eventually married, but when Dorothy was five, her stepfather began to abuse her sexually. This abuse lasted for seven years. At age 11 Allison told a relative about it, who told her mother. Ruth forced her husband to leave the girl alone, and the family remained together. The respite did not last long, as the stepfather resumed the sexual abuse, continuing for five years. Allison suffered mentally and physically, contracting gonorrhea that was not diagnosed and treated until she was in her 20s. The untreated disease left her unable to have children. Around age 11, Allison and family moved to Central Florida. Allison found respite from her family life in school. She says she became aware of her lesbian sexuality during her early adolescence. ===Education=== Allison was the first of her family to graduate from highschool. In 1967, Allison attended Florida Presbyterian College (now Eckerd College) on a National Merit scholarship. While in college, she joined the women's movement by way of a feminist collective. She credits \"militant feminists\" for encouraging her decision to write. Also around this time, Allison severed all ties to her family until 1981. She graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology. Allison subsequently did graduate work in anthropology at Florida State University, The Sagaris Institute, and the New School for Social Research, where she earned a M.A. in urban anthropology in 1981. ===Career=== Allison held a wide variety of jobs before gaining any success as a writer. From 1973-1974, she was the editor of the feminist magazine Amazing Grace, in Tallahassee, Florida. During this time, she was also a founding manager of Herstore Feminist Bookstore in Tallahassee. She worked as a salad girl, a maid, a nanny, and a substitute teacher. She also worked at a child-care center, answered phones at a rape crisis center, and clerked with the Social Security Administration. In certain periods, she trained during the day and at night sat in her motel room and wrote on yellow legal pads. She wrote about her life experiences, including the abuse by her stepfather, dealing with poverty, and her lust for women. This became the backbone of her future works.Marsh, Janet Z. \"Dorothy Allison\" in Dictionary of Literary Biography: Twenty-First-Century American Novelists, Second Series (Detroit, MI: Gale, Cengage Learning, 2009), Allison's first book of poetry, The Women Who Hate Me, was published with Long Haul Press in 1983. In 1988, her first short story collection, Trash was published by Firebrand Books. Her first novel Bastard Out of Carolina was published in 1992 to great acclaim, becoming a best-seller. It was later adapted as a film of the same name, directed by Anjelica Huston for TNT. The book and film both generated controversy because of the graphic content, and the TV film was aired on Showtime rather than TNT. The Canadian Maritime Film Classification Board initially banned distribution of the film in Canada, but it was reversed on appeal. In November 1997, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed a State Board of Education decision to ban the book in public high schools because of its graphic content. Allison would go on to publish another novel and 2 collections of poetry and short stories. In 1998, Allison founded The Independent Spirit Award to support writers who help sustain small presses and independent bookstores. In 2006, Allison was the writer in residence at Columbia College in Chicago. During spring, 2007, Allison was Emory University Center for Humanistic Inquiry\u2019s Distinguished Visiting Professor. In the summer of 2007, she was Famosa in residence at Macondo in San Antonio, Texas. In 2007, Allison announced that she was working on a new novel entitled She Who, to be published by Riverhead Press. Allison held a three-month residency at Emory University in Atlanta in 2008 as the Bill and Carol Fox Center Distinguished Visiting Professor. In fall 2009, Allison was The McGee Professor and writer in residence at Davidson College, in North Carolina. === Personal Life === Allison now lives in Northern California, calling herself a \"happily born-again Californian\". She lives with her partner of eighteen years, Alix Layman, and son, Wolf Michael.Allison at the 2008 Brooklyn Book Festival. == Writing == Themes in Allison's work include class struggle, child and sexual abuse, women, lesbianism, feminism, and family. French literary scholar M\u00e9lanie Gru\u00e9, describes Allison's work as a celebration of \"the vilified transgressive lesbian body.\" Gru\u00e9 also notes Allison's ability \"to make [lesbian] desire and pleasure public\" in her writing, in contrast to the second-wave feminist views on \"correct expressions\" of sexuality. Allison's first novel, the semi-autobiographical Bastard Out of Carolina (1992), was one of five finalists for the 1992 National Book Award.\"Depth, From The South At Hamilton College, Dorothy Allison Offers Crowd A Sip Of Reality.\" Laura T. Ryan Staff. The Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY). STARS; p. 21, October 22, 2000 Her influences include Flannery O\u2019Connor, James Baldwin, Jewelle Gomez, Toni Morrison, Bertha Harris, and Audre Lorde. Allison says The Bluest Eye by Morrison helped her to write about incest. In the early 1980s, Allison met Lorde at a poetry reading. After reading what would eventually become her short-story \"River of Names,\" Lorde approached her and told her that she simply must write. == Sex and gender activist == Allison says that the early Feminist movement changed her life. \"It was like opening your eyes under water. It hurt, but suddenly everything that had been dark and mysterious became visible and open to change.\" However, she admits, she would never have begun to publish her stories if she hadn't gotten over her prejudices, and started talking to her mother and sisters again. Allison has advocated for safer sex and is active in feminist and lesbian communities. She and Jo Arnone cofounded the Lesbian Sex Mafia in 1981, the \"oldest continuously running women\u2019s BDSM support and education group in the country\". ==Honors and Awards == * 1988 -- Trash -- Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction and Lesbian Small Press Book Award * 1988 --Trash -- American Library Association Prize for Lesbian and Gay Writing * 1992 -- Bastard Out of Carolina -- Ferro Grumley prize * 1992 -- Bastard Out of Carolina -- ALA Award for Lesbian and Gay Writing * 1994 -- Skin -- Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Studies * 1998 -- Cavedweller -- Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction * 1998 -- Cavedweller -- NY Times Notable book of the year * 2007 -- Allison was elected to the Fellowship of Southern Writers. * 2007 -- Jim Duggins Outstanding Mid-Career Novelists' Prize (Saints and Sinners Literary Festival)\"Saints and Sinners Literary Festival\". bestofneworleans.com, May 8, 2007. * 2007 -- Robert Penn Warren Award for Fiction ==Bibliography== ===Writing=== * The Women Who Hate Me: Poems by Dorothy Allison (1983) * Trash: Short Stories (1988) * The Women Who Hate Me: Poetry 1980\u20131990 (1991) * Bastard Out of Carolina (1992) * Skin: Talking About Sex, Class & Literature (1994) * Two or Three Things I Know for Sure (1995) * Cavedweller (1998) * She Who (TBA) ===Filmography=== * Bastard Out of Carolina (1996) * 2 or 3 Things But Nothing for Sure (1997) * After Stonewall (1999) * Cavedweller (2004), directed by Lisa Cholodenko with Aidan Quinn and Kyra Sedgwick ===Stage=== * Cavedweller (2003), adapted for stage by Kate Moira Ryan at the New York Theatre Workshop ==References== ==Further reading== *Contemporary Authors Online (Detroit, MI: Gale, 2004), *Philip Gambone, Travels in a Gay Nation: Portraits of LGBTQ Americans (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press, 2010), * * Carter, Natalie. \u201cA Southern Expendable\u201d: Cultural Patriarchy, Maternal Abandonment, and Narrativization in Dorothy Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina.\" Butler University Libraries, October 2013, https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1379&context;=facsch_papers * Johnson, Marrion. \"Songs in Isolation: 17 LGBTQ Writers on What They are Listening to Right Now.\" Lambda Literary, 19 Apr 2020, https://www.lambdaliterary.org/2020/04/what-lgbtq-writers-are-listening-to- right-now/ * Wright, Amy. \"Dorothy Allison: Tender to the Bone.\" Guernica Magazine, 2002, https://www.guernicamag.com/tender-to-the-bone/ * Dorothy Allison's * Official Lesbian Sex Mafia Website * * AuthorViews video interview about Bastard Out of Carolina * A Question of Class by Dorothy Allison * Guide to the Dorothy Allison Papers at Duke University Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st- century American novelists Category:20th-century American poets Category:21st- century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American women poets Category:American women novelists Category:Feminist writers Category:Lesbian feminists Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT novelists Category:LGBT poets Category:Sex-positive feminists Category:Writers of American Southern literature Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT people from South Carolina Category:Novelists from South Carolina Category:Writers from Greenville, South Carolina Category:Eckerd College alumni Category:Florida State University alumni Category:Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Fiction winners ",
