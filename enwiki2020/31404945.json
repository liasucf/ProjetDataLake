After a second round 82 (+11), Mickey Wright shot 70 (\u22121) in both of the final two rounds to win her fourth and final LPGA Championship, two strokes ahead of runners-up Mary Lena Faulk, Mary Mills, and Louise Suggs. Defending champion Judy Kimball finished six strokes back, in a tie for ninth place. It was Wright's second major title of the year and the eleventh of her thirteen career majors. It was her thirteenth tour victory of the 1963 season. It was the third of six consecutive LPGA Championships at Stardust, which opened two years earlier. After several ownership and name changes, it became Las Vegas National Golf Club in 1998. ==Past champions in the field== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Mickey Wright || align=left| || 1958, 1960, 1961 || 72 || 82 || 70 || 70 || 294 || +10 || 1 |- | align=left|Louise Suggs || align=left| || 1957 || 70 || 78 || 73 || 75 || 296 || +12 || T2 |- | align=left|Betsy Rawls || align=left| || 1959 || 74 || 73 || 76 || 76 || 299 || +15 || T6 |- | align=left|Judy Kimball || align=left| || 1962 || 73 || 81 || 73 || 73 || 300 || +16 || T9 |- | align=left|Marlene Hagge || align=left| || 1956 || 75 || 78 || 76 || 80 || 309 || +25 || T19 |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Sunday, October 13, 1963 {|class=\"wikitable\" !
