    "text": "G.G. Green's Block is located in Woodbury, Gloucester County, New Jersey, United States. The building was built in 1880 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 2001. ==Earthquake damage== Following the 2011 Virginia earthquake the vacant building and attached structures, which were also vacant, were ruled structurally unsafe. The sidewalk in front of the building as well as the adjoining streets were fenced off by the City of Woodbury. Due to several liens placed on the building and against the owner, the decision on what to do with the building fell to the City. Estimates to demolish the building ranged as high as $950,000. Woodbury City reached out to developers to take control of the property. A deal was struck with the RPM Development Group to repair the building, turn the ground floor into retail space, and construct age restricted apartments on the upper floors. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Gloucester County, New Jersey ==References== Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1880 Category:Buildings and structures in Gloucester County, New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Gloucester County, New Jersey Category:Woodbury, New Jersey Category:1880 establishments in New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places ",
