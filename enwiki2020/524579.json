    "text": "Michael David Apted, (born 10 February 1941) is an English director, producer, writer and actor. One of the most prolific English film directors of his generation, he is known for directing: the Up series (1964\u2013), the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough (1999), and the American film, Coal Miner's Daughter (1980). The last film received seven Academy Award nominations, including for the Best Picture. He also directed Nell (1994), which received three Golden Globe Award and one Academy Award nomination. On 29 June 2003, he was elected president of the Directors' Guild of America. He returned to television, directing the first three episodes of the TV series Rome (2005). Apted directed Amazing Grace, which premiered at the closing of the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. ==Early life== Apted was born in 1941 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the son of Frances Amelia (n\u00e9e Thomas) and Ronald William Apted; his father worked for an insurance company. Apted secured a scholarship to attend City of London School, followed by one to study law and history at Downing College, Cambridge. ==Career== ===Television=== Michael Apted at the 72nd Annual Peabody Awards He began his career in television as a six-months trainee at Granada Television in Manchester, where he worked as a researcher. One of his first projects at Granada would become his best known: the Up series, which began in 1964 as a profile of 14 seven-year-old children for the current affairs series World in Action. As a researcher and assistant to Canadian director Paul Almond, Apted was involved in selecting the children, who came from a variety of backgrounds and classes. Though it began as a one-shot documentary, the series has become an institution. The producers revisited the subjects every seven years, and Apted directed the later episodes in the series. It explores Apted's thesis that the British class system remains largely in place. It studies the participants based on the Jesuit motto \"Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man,\" looking at how they develop during their lives, compared to when they were seven. The series looks at the lives of these people over the years; the latest installment, 63 Up, was produced in 2019. It won a Peabody Award in 2012 \"for its creator\u2019s patience and its subjects' humanity.\"Annual Peabody Awards, May 2013. During his seven-year period of working at Granada, Apted also directed a number of episodes of Coronation Street, then written by Jack Rosenthal. Apted and Rosenthal later collaborated on a number of popular television and film projects, including the pilot episodes for The Dustbinmen and The Lovers. They worked together again in 1982 for the TV movie P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang, the first film commissioned by Britain's Channel 4. In 1976 Apted directed a play in the Granada TV Series Laurence Olivier Presents. The episode was The Collection by Harold Pinter. The play starred Laurence Olivier, Malcolm McDowell, Alan Bates and Helen Mirren. Apted used his idea from the Up Series a second time in Married in America and Married in America 2. The idea is to explore a subject and then return to the subject in a subsequent film to tell a more complete story. For his work in television, Apted has won several British Academy Awards, including one for Best Dramatic Director. *Coronation Street (1963\u201364) *Haunted (1967) *There's a Hole in Your Dustbin, Delilah (1968) \u2013 written by Jack Rosenthal *The Dustbinmen (1969) *Big Breadwinner Hog (1969) *The Lovers (1970) *Another Sunday and Sweet F.A.

He went to the United States in 1980, where he directed Coal Miner's Daughter, which received seven Academy Award nominations, winning best actress for Sissy Spacek. Both Spacek and Loretta Lynn, the subject of the film, have said that they believe Apted's outsider point of view was crucial to the movie's success in securing the participation of Appalachian residents and to the avoidance of stereotypes that previously had marred portrayals of mountain culture.Sissy Spacek and Michael Apted.
