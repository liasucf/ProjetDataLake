    "text": "Moonbabies is a Swedish duo formed in 1997 by vocalists, multi- instrumentalists, producers, and songwriters Ola Frick (Vocals, guitar and various instruments) and Carina Johansson (Vocals and keyboards). ==History== Their earliest efforts recalled early Indie/Shoegazer influences by bands like My Bloody Valentine and Cocteau Twins, but with their 2004 album The Orange Billboard, developed into more sophisticated pop music with a touch of The Beach Boys and The Beatles, as well as experimentation with electronics. The Single/Mini-album War on Sound was released in 2005 and became an immediate indie-anthem and followed success on radio and TV-shows like Grey's Anatomy. In 2007 Moonbabies at the Ballroom was released, a somewhat more constructed and song-oriented album including Take me to the Ballroom, Shout it Out, Walking on my Feet and Cocobelle which all were frequently aired on college radio worldwide and included in several TV shows and commercials. Their comeback album Wizards on the Beach was released in April 2015. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Wizards on the Beach (2015) *Moonbabies at the Ballroom (2007) *The Orange Billboard (2004) *June and Novas (2001) ===Singles=== *24' / 'The Ocean Kill' (Digital Single) (2014) *Chorus' / 'Raindrops' (Digital Single) (2014) *Take me to the Ballroom (Single) (2007) *War on Sound (Single) (2007) *War on Sound Mini Album (2005) *Forever Changes Everything Now (Single) (2004) *Sun A.M.
