    "text": "Pranas Puskunigis (16 July 1860 \u2013 27 November 1946) was a Lithuanian musician, one of the first and most influential proponents of kankl\u0117s. During his life, he taught about 120 people how to play kankl\u0117s and established several ensembles, one of which is still active. He laid the groundwork for kankl\u0117s education and adapted numerous folk and professional songs to the instrument, but did not attempt to modify its design. ==Early life== Puskunigis was born on 16 July 1860 in the village near Sintautai, August\u00f3w Governorate, Congress Poland. His father was well respected in the community and acted as a priest in an emergency. Therefore, it is said that his nickname puskunigis (literally: half-priest) became the surname of his children. After three years at the Sintautai primary school, Puskunigis attended the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. But his mother's death forced him to abandon studies and return to farming. He learned to play kankl\u0117s from his uncle, got introduced to a violin and clarinet in Veiveriai. In 1882, he moved to Kaunas where he worked at various churches and learned to play piano and organ. For a time he lived in the United States, but returned in 1905 and settled in near Veiveriai. He had a small farm of , but devoted his time and energy to music. He once again became a church organist and organized an ensemble of kankl\u0117s players, mostly from the students at the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. Its first performance was in 1906 at the nearby Sasnava. This ensemble, known simply as Kankl\u0117s since 1984, continues to this day. Puskunigis manufactured numerous kankl\u0117s that had 11 or 12 strings. ==World War I and after== During World War I, Saliamonas Banaitis invited Puskunigis to establish an ensemble of kankl\u0117s players at his printing press in Kaunas. The ensemble began giving performances in late 1915. Accompanied by a student choir from the Saul\u0117 Gymnasium (led by Banaitis' son and future composer ), the ensemble organized a concert at the Kaunas City Theater on 5 January 1916. The ensemble also performed at a fair in K\u00f6nigsberg. In 1922, Puskinigis was invited by General to organize an ensemble that would perform during the official state ceremonies at the Kaunas War Museum. He gathered a group of veterans of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and experienced players from Skriaud\u017eiai which debuted in May 1923 but due to conflicts the project was soon abandoned. Puskunigis was then invited by a school in \u0160an\u010diai where he trained about 60 students. The school ensemble debuted at the Vytautas' the Great Church during the first Lithuanian Song Festival in 1924 and recorded several songs with the operatic tenor Kipras Petrauskas. In June 1925, Puskunigis was one of the founders of the Kankl\u0117s Players' Society, chaired by and . The same year Puskunigis was interviewed by Armas Otto V\u00e4is\u00e4nen, the Finnish scholar of folk music. In 1925\u20131926, Puskunigis petitioned the Lithuanian government for a permit and funding to open Kankl\u0117s Musical School three times. The permit was finally received in 1930 and he became a teacher. Lithuanian composers, such as Juozas Naujalis and Juozas Gruodis, considered kankl\u0117s to be an obsolete instrument and did not support the efforts of Puskunigis. At the same time, Puskunigis protested efforts to improve and modernize kankl\u0117s. Therefore, he soon retired from the musical school and spent remainder of his life in Skriaud\u017eiai. He spent the time correcting and organizing his writings \u2013 note sheets, original and translated articles, songs, poems. His son counted 48 songs created by Puskunigis. His most successful songs are (The Anthem of Kankl\u0117s Players) and (A Song about the Past). His textbook on kankl\u0117s was published in 1932. In 1937, he recorded 34 songs. He died in 1946 in Skriaud\u017eiai. His home in Skriaud\u017eiai was turned into a museum of the 19th- century lifestyle in 1987. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Lithuanian folk musicians Category:Lithuanian organists Category:Male organists ",
