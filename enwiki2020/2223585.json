    "text": "Earth (; released in India as 1947: Earth) is a 1999 Indian period romance drama film directed by Deepa Mehta. It is based upon Bapsi Sidhwa's novel, Cracking India (1991, US; 1992, India; originally published as Ice Candy Man, 1988, UK), set during the 1947 partition of India. Earth is the second installment of Mehta's Elements trilogy, preceded by Fire (1996) and followed by Water (2005). It was India's entry for the 1999 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. ==Plot== The story is set in Lahore (now the capital of Pakistani Punjab) in the time period directly before and during the partition of India in 1947 at the time of Indian independence. A young girl with polio, Lenny (Maia Sethna), narrates the story through the voice of her adult self (Shabana Azmi). She is from a wealthy Parsi family who hope to remain neutral to the rising tensions between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims in the area. She is adored and protected by her parents, Bunty (Kitu Gidwani) and Rustom (Arif Zakaria), and cared for by her Ayah, a beautiful Hindu woman named Shanta (Nandita Das). Both Dil Navaz, the Ice-Candy Man (Aamir Khan), and Hassan, the Masseur (Rahul Khanna) are Muslim and in love with Shanta. Shanta, Dil, and Hassan are part of a small group of friends from different faiths (some of whom work for Lenny's family) who spend their days together in the park. With partition, however, this once unified group of friends becomes divided and tragedy ensues. ==Cast== * Aamir Khan \u2013 Dil Nawaz * Rahul Khanna \u2013 Hassan, the Masseur * Nandita Das \u2013 Shanta, the maid * Maia Sethna \u2013 Lenny Sethna * Shabana Azmi \u2013 older Lenny, narrator * Kitu Gidwani \u2013 Bunty Sethna * Arif Zakaria \u2013 Rustom Sethna * Kulbhushan Kharbanda \u2013 Imam Din * Kumar Rajendra \u2013 Refugee Police * Pavan Malhotra \u2013 Butcher ==Critical reception== ===Reviews=== The film holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and states that Earth, \"is effective because it doesn't require much history from its viewers, explains what needs to be known, and has a universal message.\" The New York Times described it as \"a powerful and disturbing reminder of how a civilization can suddenly crack under certain pressures.\" The New Yorker argues that, \"Deepa Mehta handles her material convincingly, and the cast is so likable that they wear the larger themes like beautiful garments.\" Rediff.com notes that, \"Aamir Khan has probably given the best performance of his life. It is hard to imagine another actor bringing alive the nuances of the ice-candy man the way he does.\" Planet Bollywood gave the film a 9.5 out of 10 and stated that, \"Earth is strongly recommended to those who want to see a different type of Hindi film and who are tired of the usual boy meets girl stories and revenge dramas.\" ===Awards and nominations=== * Asian Film Festival \u2013 Best Film Award * Filmfare Best Male Debut Award \u2013 Rahul Khanna * Filmfare Best Female Debut Award \u2013 Nandita Das * Earth was India's official entry for the 71st Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1999, but was not included among the final five nominees selected by the AMPAS. ==Soundtrack== ==References== ==External links== * *Official trailer * Category:1998 films Category:1990s romantic drama films Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:English-language films Category:English-language Indian films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Deepa Mehta Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Films set in Lahore Category:Films about religious violence in India Category:Films set in the partition of India Category:Films set in the Indian independence movement Category:Films scored by A.
