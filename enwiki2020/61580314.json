    "text": "The Junior Vagliano Trophy is a biennial girls amateur golf tournament. It is co-organised by the R&A; and the European Golf Association and is contested by teams representing \"Great Britain and Ireland\" and the \"Continent of Europe\". It is played in odd-numbered years at the same time and location as the Vagliano Trophy. The first event was in 2011. Girls must be under-16 on 1 January of the year of the event. The Continent of Europe has won all five matches to date. ==Format== The competition involves various match play matches between players selected from the two teams of 6, either singles and foursomes. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, with half a point each for any match that is tied after 18 holes. If the entire match is tied, the previously winning team retains the Trophy. A foursomes match is a competition between two teams of two golfers. The golfers on the same team take alternate shots throughout the match, with the same ball. Each hole is won by the team that completes the hole in the fewest shots. A fourball match is a competition between two teams of two golfers. All four golfers play their own ball throughout the round. Each hole is won by the team whose individual golfer had the lowest score. A singles match is a standard match play competition between two golfers. The contest is played over two days, with three foursomes and six singles matches on each day, a total of 18 points. ==Results== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" ! Year !! Venue !!
