Excerpt available at Google Books. The clip included waves reflecting a sunset, and lapping against the shore. Reeves and Fournier made the project, with the feedback of John Lasseter, to work out details of rendering water and waves realistically, including lighting, motion, and shading. It was exhibited at SIGGRAPH in Dallas, in August 1986,John Lasseter by Richard Neupert p. 55 along with Lasseter\u2019s landmark computer animated short, Luxo Jr., and another test project, Beach Chair, by Eben Ostby. The methods developed during the creation of this project were the basis of the water in Finding Nemo. It is based on an oceanographic model of ocean waves, which Fournier dug out of the literature, from the nineteenth century. Flags and Waves can also be found as an Easter egg in Pixar Short Films Collection \u2013 Volume 1. ==Content== The fourteen second short begins with the title Flags and Waves, and under it the title in French: Drapeaux et Vagues, superimposed on the SMPTE color bars, while a high pitch frequency sound is made. The bars are revealed to be a flag, which is flapping in the wind, as the noise shifts, to the sound of a calm beach side. The camera pans up, to show three more flags flapping, in front of a beach, as the bright sun appears to be setting. ==References== ==External links== *Flags and Waves on YouTube Category:1986 films Category:Pixar short films Category:1986 animated films Category:American films Category:1980s American animated films Category:1980s computer-animated films Category:American animated short films ",
