    "text": "The Graduate School of Princeton University is the main graduate school of Princeton University. Founded in 1869, the School is responsible for the majority of Princeton's master's and doctoral degree programs in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. The school offers Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in 42 disciplines. It also administers several pre-professional programs, including the Master in Finance (M.Fin.), Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.), and Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master in Public Affairs (M.P.A.), Master in Public Policy (M.P.P.), and Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degrees. The Graduate School is widely considered to be one of the best academic institutions in the United States and in the world. Students are able to work directly with faculty advisors, many of whom are the leading scholars in their fields. The relatively small number of students allows doctoral education to be tailored to each students needs, emphasizing original and independent research in a tight-knit community of scholars. Students who complete the program continue on to careers in academia, government, and industry. The Graduate School has produced a number of Nobel Prize Laureates, Fields Medal Winners, university presidents, cabinet ministers, MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" Fellows, Pulitzer Prize winners, ambassadors, heads of state, and heads of government. The School also guarantees fully funded stipends, which covers tuition, health fees, and living expenses, for all PhD students. PhD students may earn additional funding from teaching fellowships, research assistantships, and competitive awards. Master's students are also able to graduate debt-free through Princeton's \"no-loan\" policy. ==History== In 1771, future President James Madison began graduate work at Princeton University under the tutelage of President John Witherspoon, another founding father. Often considered Princeton's \"first graduate student,\" Madison studied Hebrew and Political Philosophy, which provided him the foundation for his later career as the Delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from Virginia, Secretary of State, and President of the United States. After his studies, students were then permitted to stay at the university after receiving their bachelor's degrees. By 1869, graduate education was standardized through the establishment of general examinations and graduate fellowships. Princeton conferred the first graduate degrees to James F. Williamson and William Libby in 1879. The first Dean of the Graduate School was Andrew Fleming West. He envisioned a graduate institution that would both produce high quality graduate work from a small number of students. By the 1880s, eight graduate students were enrolled in programs in art and archaeology, astronomy, biology, classics, geology, mathematics, philosophy, and physics. Enrollment gradually increased over the years, particularly under the leadership of physicist Augustus Trowbridge. Applications for graduate enrollment also rose after World War II and after federal funding for graduate fellowships increased substantially, most notably in the sciences. Women began to enroll in the Graduate School in the 1960s. The first PhD was awarded in 1964. In 1977, Nina G. Garsoian accepted a position as the ninth dean of the Graduate School, the first woman to occupy that position. ===The Graduate College=== The Graduate College, the residence of the Dean of the Graduate School and home to many graduate students, was established in 1913. Inspired by the design of Magdalen Tower at Oxford University, the architecture of the Graduate College features brown and gray Princeton stone and green and blue roofs. Build in 1913 and expanded in 1927, the Old Graduate College features traditional Gothic-style architecture in addition to the 173-foot tall Cleveland Tower, a memorial to former university trustee and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. The central quadrangle of the Graduate College, Thomson College, is a memorial to United States Senator John R. Thomson. New Graduate College was built adjacent to the Old Graduate College in 1962, presenting modern-style architecture and comfortable living spaces. ===High table=== The tradition of \"High Table\" traces back to Oxford University and Cambridge University. Fellows of the college were to sit at the end of long refectory tables on raised platforms, dais, above the undergraduates. At Princeton, the tradition began in 1913 in Procter Hall with Professor Howard Crosby Butler. Students, faculty, and guests were invited to sit with the Dean of the Graduate College at a monthly ceremony. Until the 1970s, dinner at Procter Hall opened with Latin grace spoken by a student, the Master (Professor), or the Dean. High Table continues to bring select students and faculty together for discussions and, during formal events, dinners jackets or academic gowns may also be worn. ==Academics== Policies and procedures for graduate academics at Princeton are administered by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School, located at Clio Hall. Admission to the Graduate School is highly selective with an acceptance rate of approximately 11.7% across all disciplines. The average Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores for admitted students were 163 out of 170 on the verbal section, 161 out of 170 on the quantitative section and 4.5 out of 6 on the analytical writing section. In the 2018-2019 academic year, 1,373 students were admitted into the graduate school. ===Degrees and programs=== The Graduate School offers a number of degree-granting programs in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. In addition to its own Masters and PhD programs, the School oversees graduate degrees for the Bendheim Center for Finance, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
