    "text": "The European Innovation Council (EIC) was introduced by the European Commission to support the commercialization of high-risk, high-impact technologies in the European Union. Currently in its pilot phase, the European Innovation Council will be fully implemented from 2021 under Horizon Europe. In its latest form, the concept has been put forth by the EU Research Commissioner Carlos Moedas in mid-2015. Similar proposals were presented over the years, including by Hans Wigzell in 2002, and by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisation (EARTO) in 2010. ==See also== * European Research Council (ERC) * Lisbon Strategy * Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development * European Institute of Technology (EIT) * European Research Area (ERA) * Directorate-General for Research * Directorate-General of the Joint Research Centre (European Commission) * European Research Advisory Board (EURAB) * European Council of Applied Sciences and Engineering (Euro-CASE) * Information Society Technologies Advisory Group (ISTAG) == References == Category:21st century in technology Category:European Union and science and technology Category:Science and technology in Europe Category:Technology strategy ",
