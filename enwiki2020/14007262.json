They were successful in the early 1980s, but by the mid-1980s, their popularity began to decline, and the members split up.Lustans Lakejer interview Electricity Club They were initially influenced by 1970's art rock and post-punk acts like Roxy Music, David Bowie, Joy Division, Magazine and Ultravox but adopted a more sophisticated synthpop and new romantic style on their most successful albums Uppdrag i Gen\u00e8ve and En plats i solen. The latter album was produced by Richard Barbieri from the British group Japan and featured saxophone playing on three tracks by Mick Karn. The following year an English-language version of that album, A Place in the Sun, was released under the group name Vanity Fair, but with no commercial success. By 1984 Johan Kinde had parted ways with the other original members and released two further albums as Lustans Lakejer and then embarked on a solo career. Lustans Lakejer reformed in the 1990s and released the critically acclaimed album \u00c5kersberga in 1999. In 2007 they reunited again to perform the song \"Allt vi en g\u00e5ng trodde p\u00e5\" in Melodifestivalen's second semifinal for the opportunity to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. The band failed to make the top five and was voted off the contest on 10 February before final voting. In 2011 a new album, Elixir, was released. In 2017 Lustans Lakejer performed the album En plats i solen in its entirety on a swedish tour and were joined on stage by the album's producer Richard Barbieri on keyboards. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *1981 \u2013 Lustans Lakejer *1981 \u2013 Uppdrag i Gen\u00e8ve *1982 \u2013 En plats i solen *1983 \u2013 A Place in the Sun (as \"Vanity Fair\") *1984 \u2013 Lustavision *1985 \u2013 Sinnenas rike *1999 \u2013 \u00c5kersberga *2007 \u2013 Samlade Synder 1981-2007 *2011 \u2013 Elixir ==References== ==External links== *page about Lustans lakejer *Page about lustans lakejer Category:Swedish musical groups Category:1978 establishments in Sweden Category:Musical groups established in 1978 ",
