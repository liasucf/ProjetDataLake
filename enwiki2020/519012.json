    "text": "The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion du Qu\u00e9bec (; ), branded as T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec (), is a Canadian French-language public educational television network in the province of Quebec. It is a provincial Crown corporation owned by the Government of Quebec. The network's main studios and general offices are located at the corner of Saint Catherine and Fullum streets in Downtown Montreal. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec is equivalent to Ontario's TVOntario and TFO, and British Columbia's Knowledge Network, and similar to the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and its affiliated state networks, in that it is somewhat modest in scope, runs mostly educational or cultural programming, and does not try to compete with privately-owned television networks or with the Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9 network owned and operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, unlike TFO and the anglophone educational networks, it does run commercials during its programming. All programming on T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec is in French, although there are a few shows and movies that are presented in the original language (predominantly English), with French subtitles. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec operates local offices in Val-d'Or, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Rimouski, Gatineau, Sept-\u00celes, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Carleton-sur-Mer. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec is one of the partners in the TV5 Qu\u00e9bec Canada and TV5Monde consortiums. It also had a 25% stake in the French-Canadian arts specialty channel, ARTV, which it sold to the CBC in 2010. ==History== Logo while under the name \"Radio Qu\u00e9bec\" On April 20, 1945, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, under the mandate of Premier Maurice Duplessis, passed a law allowing Quebec to create and run a public broadcasting network, as a provincial counterpart to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, it never got beyond the planning stages until February 22, 1968, when the Daniel Johnson, Sr. administration created a new public broadcasting agency, \"Radio-Qu\u00e9bec\", under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. Shortly afterward, the first Radio-Qu\u00e9bec program, a radio program on the history of Canada called En montant la rivi\u00e8re, was produced. Produced later that year was its first television program, Les Oraliens, where space aliens taught kids how to properly pronounce French words and phrases. In 1969, a new law was passed by the National Assembly of Quebec, creating l'Office de radio-t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion du Qu\u00e9bec (\"Quebec Office of Radio and Television Broadcasting\"), where Radio-Qu\u00e9bec was placed. Radio-Qu\u00e9bec began broadcasting on its own in 1972 as a cable channel, which broadcast evenings on community channels in Montreal and Quebec City, then expanded in 1973 to Hull, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. As a cable network, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec was generally on the air weeknights from 8 pm to 10 pm. The network of over-the-air transmitters was launched on January 19, 1975 with the sign-ons of CIVM-TV in Montreal and CIVQ-TV in Quebec City, making its programming available to an even wider audience. In its early days after the terrestrial network began, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec would provide week-delay videotapes of its programming line-up to cable systems in communities not served by a Radio-Qu\u00e9bec station. Some Radio- Qu\u00e9bec programs were also seen on most Radio-Canada stations, not only in Quebec, but throughout Canada as well; this arrangement continued into the 1980s.Western British Columbia TV Guide listings at Radio-Info.com: \"Retro: Vancouver/Victoria/Seattle Wed, Nov 9, 1977\", November 6, 2009; listings for CBUFT included Les Oraliens and Les 100 tours de Centour. In 1977, Radio- Qu\u00e9bec opened its third station, CIVO-TV in Hull, serving the greater Ottawa area\u2014the station was built after acquiring the licence and facilities of a failed TVA affiliate, CFVO-TV.Canadian Communications Foundation: CFVO-TV. Note: This article contradicts with the CCF's page for T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec, which states that the closedown of CFVO-TV and its conversion to CIVO-TV happened in 1976. Radio-Qu\u00e9bec was off the air during most of 1978, due to a lockout of its employees in a labour dispute. In 1979, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec's agency was restructured as a provincial crown corporation, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de radio-t\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Qu\u00e9bec (\"Quebec Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation\"). The network had also adopted the slogan, L'autre t\u00e9l\u00e9vision (\"The other television\"). On January 1, 1985, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec began providing its programming to its stations and cable systems via satellite, using Anik C-3. Also that year, the CRTC granted Radio-Qu\u00e9bec permission to show commercials during some of its programming, initially for a two-year trial run. This authorization became permanent\u2014by the 2002\u201303 fiscal year, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec's revenues from advertising would account for 45.8% of its total revenue. In 1994, the Quebec government announced budget cuts for Radio-Qu\u00e9bec, in which its budget was reduced by $10 million. In 1995, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec president Jean Fortier announced that the network was virtually bankrupt. As a result, over 150 staffers were laid off (out of over 750 people employed), with plans for further layoffs to trim the employee count to 300 staffers. Programming produced in-house would either be cancelled or transferred to independent companies. In addition, the network would adopt the \"T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec\" name the following year, in 1996, with the crown corporation renamed as \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion du Qu\u00e9bec\". A proposal for the new T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec to carry strictly educational programming was never carried out. Instead, it retained its mixed educational-entertainment schedule. The monetary shortfall was short-lived, as by 1997, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec resumed productions on its own and increased its amount of original programming. ==Programming== The Montreal offices of T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec Over 40% of T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s programming is children's programming. In 2005, Ramdam was a popular show for 2 to 11 year-olds. Other children's shows have included Cornemuse, Zoboomafoo, and Nickelodeon series Dora l'exploratrice and Bob le bricoleur. Animated shows include IDragon, Les M\u00e9lodilous, Le Petit tracteur rouge, and Toupie et Binou. For 6 to 8 year-olds, shows have included Macaroni tout garni, Nickelodeon's Rocket Power, Esprits-fant\u00f4mes, and Le Petit roi Macius. Ramdam and Banza\u00ef are both aimed at pre-teens (9 to 12), and ADN-X is a teens show that provides practical solutions to everyday problems. T\u00e9l\u00e9- Qu\u00e9bec's cultural programming reflects Quebec's diverse cultural expression in fiction, songs, music, cinema, visual art, and drama. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec shows such as Belle et Bum, M\u2019as-tu lu? and Pulsart help to promote Quebec artists and creators and their works. Belle et Bum is a music show that invited 160 performers or groups in 2005\u20132006, who performed 230 songs by Quebec songwriters or composers. M'as-tu lu? is a book show that covers books of all genres and for all audiences; in 2005\u20132006, 260 books were presented, 124 of which were by Quebec authors. Pulsart is a magazine show on cultural activities taking place all over Quebec. A new weekly cultural magazine-style show, Libre \u00e9change, deals with a ranges of different creative arts, including dance, cinema, literature, sculpture, painting, television, music, and theatre. As well, a new series of \"living portraits\" will profile notable living creators such as authors, filmmakers, architects and thinkers. T\u00e9l\u00e9- Qu\u00e9bec presents a range of films, including \"auteur\" films by notable directors, feature-length documentaries, premiere showings, and Quebec films. All films are shown without commercial interruptions. During the last five years, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec showed over 959 hours of documentaries, which made up 18% of its programming. Documentary topics included socio-political, cultural, historic, scientific, and travel. Between 2000 and 2006, 137 documentaries and 39 series were produced. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec also hosts debate and discussion-oriented shows that allow for an exchange of ideas and perspectives on social and political issues. Points chauds is a show on international political issues. M\u00e9chant contraste! is a pan-Quebec magazine show on social, political, and economic issues. Dussault-D\u00e9bat is a debate show. As a community service, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec has a number of shows that present a regional perspective, such as M\u00e9chant contraste!, \u00c0 la di Stasio, les Francs Tireurs, M'as-tu lu?, Une pilule, and Pulsart. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec also has an Internet strategy, as part of its educational and cultural mission. In 2003, the extremis.tv website won a G\u00e9meaux prize for the best Internet site. In 2004, du missionarctique.tv won the same award. The website for the teen-oriented show ADN-X has interactive activities including a comic strip-creating activity. ===Programming in English=== The only T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec program that was entirely in English was Quebec School Telecasts, a weekday, hour-long block of English-language instructional programming. The series was first telecasted on CBC Television outlets in Quebec in the early-1960s. Radio-Qu\u00e9bec picked up the program in 1981; it aired on Radio-Qu\u00e9bec and the later T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec until the early-2000s. In 1985, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec and TVOntario signed an exchange arrangement, in which English-language TVO programming would be seen on Radio- Qu\u00e9bec, and Radio-Qu\u00e9bec's French-language programming would be seen on TVO. In 2018, Vincent Brousseau-Pouliot's English Language Arts Network (ELAN) filed an intervention to CRTC licence renewals for the service, seeking that T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec be required to devote 20% of its programming and budget to programs of interest to anglophone, indigenous, and other visible minority communities of Quebec. The proposal called for at least 10% of this quota to be put towards English-language programming. ELAN stated that this was intended to reflect the diversity of the province's population, arguing that they were served well by news programming, but underserved by cultural programming of interest. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec objected to this proposal, citing that anglophones were already well-served by commercial English-language broadcasters. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Martine Ouellet similarly argued that it was \"not surprising that the anglophone community feels entitled to demand more.\" The CRTC declined the request, stating that it was beyond the scope of licence renewal, and \"should be the subject of a policy proceeding in which broadcasters as a whole are considered.\" ==T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec HD and digital conversion== T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec HD logo On June 12, 2008, T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec launched an HD simulcast of its Montr\u00e9al station CIVM-TV called \"T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec HD\". It signed on over the air on channel 27 (PSIP 17.1) from Olympic Stadium in Montreal in January 2009, making CIVM-DT the first educational television station in Canada to broadcast digitally. After the analogue shutdown and digital conversion in Canada, scheduled for August 31, 2011, CIVM-DT will move to channel 26. A digital terrestrial television transmitter requested and authorized for construction in Quebec City for CIVQ-TV did not sign on until August 2010, weeks before the September 25, 2010 deadline to sign on or file an extension.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-268, 25 September 2008, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion du Qu\u00e9bec, CIVM-DT Montr\u00e9al - New transmitter in Qu\u00e9bec That transmitter broadcasts from \u00c9difice Marie-Guyart in downtown Quebec City on channel 25 (PSIP 15.1). After the digital conversion in 2011, CIVQ moved its digital signal to channel 15. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec intended on converting all of its transmitters to digital by the digital transition deadline of August 31, 2011, including its transmitters that are not required to transition by this deadline. ==Stations== T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec's network consists of 12 stations and five repeaters, originating at CIVM-DT in Montreal. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\" | Station | City of licence | Channel (PSIP) | Channel (digital)Industry Canada: \"DTV Post-Transition Allotment Plan\", December 2008 | ERP | HAAT | Transmitter Coordinates | Notes |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVA- DT | Val-d'Or | 12.1 | 12 (VHF) | 22.0 kW | 201.1 m | | Signed on January 18, 1980 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVA-DT-1 | Rouyn- Noranda | 8.1 | 8 (VHF) | 19.0 kW | 219.6 m | | Signed on January 18, 1980, as CIVN-TV |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVB-DT | Rimouski | 22.1 | 22 (UHF) | 136.0 kW | 460.5 m | | Signed on November 3, 1981 as CIVR- TV |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVB-DT-1 | Grand-Fonds | 31.1 | 31 (UHF) | 95.0 kW | 508.0 m | | Broadcast from Mont Grand-Fonds, serving La Malbaie and Baie-Saint-Paul; signed on in 1985 |- style=\"vertical- align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVC-DT | Trois-Rivi\u00e8res | 45.1 | 45 (UHF) | 290.0 kW | 398.1 m | | Signed on October 6, 1981; originally broadcast from the old CBC Tower at Mont-Carmel until the plane crash on April 23, 2001 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVF-DT | Baie-Trinit\u00e9 | 12.1 | 12 (VHF) | 46 kW | 148.2 m | | Also covers Baie-Comeau; signed on Fall 1982 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVG-DT | Sept-\u00celes | 9.1 | 9 (VHF) | 19 kW | 218.9 m | | Signed on Fall 1982 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVK-DT | Carleton | 15.1 | 15 (UHF) | 140 kW | 459.0 m | | Signal also covers Campbellton, New Brunswick; signed on in 1984 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVK-DT-1 | Gascons | 32.1 | 32 (UHF) | 180.0 kW | 200.9 m | | Signal also covers the Acadian Peninsula; signed on in 1984 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVK- DT-2 | Perc\u00e9 | 40.1 | 40 (UHF) | 0.6 kW | 405.4 m | | Signed on in 1984 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text- align: left;\" | CIVK-DT-3 | Gasp\u00e9 | 35.1 | 35 (UHF) | 0.55 kW | 424.5 m | | Signed on in 1984 |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVM-DT | Montreal | 17.1 | 26 (UHF) | 269 kW | 170.6 m | | flagship station; signed on January 19, 1975 with CIVQ-TV; broadcasts from transmitter atop the Olympic Stadium tower; originally broadcast its analogue signal from Mount Royal |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | CIVO-DT | Gatineau | 30.1 | 30 (UHF) | 300.2 kW | 358.0 m | | Broadcasts from Camp Fortune; signed on August 15, 1977; was licensed to Hull prior to 2002.

On terrestrial cable, however, it is generally seen only in Quebec and in communities in Ontario and New Brunswick which are within the broadcast range of a T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec transmitter. Outside of this area, few cable systems, such as MTS in Winnipeg, carry T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec in their digital tiers. T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec (and its predecessor, Radio-Qu\u00e9bec) was also assigned channel 2 in Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, channel 10 in Lithium Mines and channel 21 in Mont-Laurier. As of 2009, service has yet to begin in these communities; in addition, it had later lost its channel 2 slot at Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, after that channel was reallocated to Quebec City (CFAP-TV) and Rimouski (CJBR-TV). It is also unknown if the Lithium Mines transmitter was replaced by, or provided secondary service of, CIVA-TV, the T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec outlet serving nearby Val-d'Or. ==See also== * List of Quebec television channels * List of Quebec television series * Television of Quebec * Culture of Quebec ==References== ==External links== * Official website ** T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec: Histoire * Canadian Communications Foundation - CIVM-TV History * Montreal affiliate CIVM at TV Hat * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Organizations based in Montreal Category:Television channels and stations established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Quebec ",
