This is the follow-up show of Mr Trot (including its epilogue version The Taste of Mr Trot), casting the top 7 of the now-defunct program. The program was planned as a purpose of fan meeting, which was originally for Mr Trot but never occurred due to the coronavirus pandemic. Though it was initially organised for 3 episodes, it was remade as a regular on account of high popularity. == Cast == === Hosts === * Kim Sung-joo * Boom === Main cast === * Lim Young-woong * * Lee Chan-won * (left after episode 17) * * Jang Min-ho * === Guests === * Hong Jin-young (episode 5) * (episode 6) * (episode 6) * Na Tae-joo (episode 6) * (episodes 6, 24) * (episodes 6, 21\u201322) * (episodes 6, 23) * Kim Kyung-min (episode 6) * (episode 6) * (episode 7) * Lyn (episodes 9, 18\u201319) * (episode 10) * (episodes 13, 20) * (episodes 14\u201315, 20) * (episodes 14\u201315) * (episodes 14\u201315) * Shin Sung (episodes 14\u201315, 21\u201322) * (episodes 14\u201315) * (episodes 14\u201315) * Jang Song-ho (episodes 14\u201315) * Roh Ji-hoon (episode 16) * (episode 16) * (episodes 17, 20) * Baek Ji-young (episode 18-19) * Lee Hae-ri (Davichi) (episodes 18\u201319) * Solji (EXID) (episodes 18\u201319) * U Sung-eun (episodes 18\u201319) * Ben (episodes 18\u201319) * (episode 20) * (episode 20) * (episode 20) * (episodes 23, 27) * (episodes 23, 27) * Park Ki-woong (episode 23) * (episode 23) * Jung Myung-gyu (episode 23) * (episode 24) * (episode 24) * Kang Hong-seok (episode 24) * Kim Junsu (episode 24) * Luna (f(x)) (episode 24) * Kim Young-ok (episode 26) * Baek Il-seob (episode 26) * Sunwoo Yong-nyeo (episode 26) * Im Hyun-sik (episode 26) * Noh Joo-hyun (episode 26) * (episode 26) * (episode 27) * (episode 27) * (episode 27) * (episode 27) * Jo Kwan-woo (episode 28) * Im Tae-kyung (episode 28) * Kim Tae-woo (g.o.d) (episode 28) * Tei (episode 28) * (episode 28) * (episode 28) == Episodes == === Episode 1 === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
