    "text": "\"History Repeating\" is a song written by Alex Gifford and originally performed by the Propellerheads featuring Shirley Bassey in 1997. The single was a #1 hit on the UK Indie Chart, and was also Bassey's first top ten appearance on any US chart since 1973's \"Never Never Never\", making #10 on the US Dance Club Chart. ==Single release== The single was released shortly before the Propellerheads album Decksandrumsandrockandroll (their only album to date), released in 1998 by Wall of Sound in Europe and DreamWorks in the US and Japan. The Propellerheads had previously worked with the James Bond composer David Arnold on the Bond tribute album Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project, when they remixed the John Barry composition \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". The track is a fusion of several different styles of big beat, breakbeat and jazz combined with the powerful vocals of Shirley Bassey. The sleeve cover, an illustration by Duke D. Jukes, takes its inspiration from classic album sleeve from the Capitol 1957 release Just One Of Those Things (album) by Nat King Cole. The retro style was also continued with the video, filmed in monochrome, the opening of which is themed on a BBC TV jazz show called Jazz 1200, hosted by Roger Humphries, and clearly harks back to the serious music shows of the 1960s. Scenes from the video shoot were included in the Divas are Forever DVD. ===Chart performance=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1997) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) |align=\"center\"|55 |- |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|67 |- |align=\"left\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |align=\"center\"|16 |- |align=\"left\"|France (SNEP) |align=\"center\"|71 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |align=\"center\"|65 |- |align=\"left\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |align=\"center\"|7 |- |align=\"left\"|Italy (Hit Parade Italia) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Tipparade) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |align=\"center\"|52 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|32 |- |align=\"left\"|Scotland (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|24 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|19 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Indie (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play |align=\"center\"|10 |} ==Track listing== ;European 2-track CD single #\"History Repeating\" (Knee Length Mix) \u2013 4:03 #\"History Repeating\" (Ankle Length Mix) \u2013 5:49 ;UK 3-track maxi CD single #\"History Repeating\" (Knee Length Mix) \u2013 4:03 #\"History Repeating\" (Ankle Length Mix) \u2013 5:49 #\"History Repeating\" (Hip Length Mix) \u2013 4:14 ;UK 12\" vinyl single # \"History Repeating\" (Ankle Length Mix) \u2013 5:49 # \"History Repeating\" (Knee Length Mix) \u2013 4:03 # \"History Repeating\" (Hip Length Mix) \u2013 4:14 Track 1 only appears on side A ==Personnel== *Shirley Bassey \u2013 vocals *Will White and Alex Gifford \u2013 all instruments ==Cover versions== It has been covered by Matt Dusk on his album Back In Town (2006).
