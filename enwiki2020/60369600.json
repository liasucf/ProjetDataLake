    "text": "The 2020 CONIFA World Football Cup will be the fourth edition of the CONIFA World Football Cup, an international football tournament for states, minorities, stateless peoples and regions unaffiliated with FIFA organized by CONIFA. Somaliland were originally announced as the tournament host, but were forced to withdraw as hosts in August 2019. It was later announced that the tournament would be held in Skopje, the capital city of North Macedonia, with no CONIFA member as designated host.http://www.conifa.org/en/2019/12/02/new- conifa-sportsbet-io-world-football-cup-2020-location-announced/ However, on 23 March 2020 CONIFA announced that the tournament will not be taking place in North Macedonia from 30 May \u2013 7 June because of the coronavirus pandemic.http://www.conifa.org/en/2020/03/23/announcement-conifa-sportsbet-io- world-football-cup-2020/ The Tournament was eventually cancelled by CONIFA with the organisation outlining plans to expand continental tournaments. ==Host selection== In January 2019, at the CONIFA Annual General Meeting in Krakow, Poland, it was announced that Somaliland had been selected to act as the host for the 2020 CONIFA World Football Cup. In August 2019 CONIFA announced that Somaliland had given up hosting rights for the 2020 ConIFA World Football Cup without naming a replacement. Kernow had subsequently bid to host the tournament.Kernow are officially in the running to host the 2020 WFC Kernow Football Alliance. 1 September 2019. Retrieved 9 November 2019. In December 2019 CONIFA announced that the tournament would be held in Skopje, the capital city of North Macedonia with no CONIFA member as designated host. ==Venues== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !North Macedonia |- !Skopje, Skopje |- |To\u0161e Proeski Arena |- |250px |- |Capacity: 36,460 |- !rowspan=1 colspan=2| |} ==Qualification== CONIFA assigns the number of berths for each continent according to the percentage of CONIFA members that come from that continent. Europe has 4 berths, including one for the winners of the 2019 CONIFA European Football Cup. Asia and Africa both have 3, and North America, South America and Oceania have one berth each. Additionally, one berth is reserved for a wild card team. K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja, the defending champions, qualified automatically. Originally, Somaliland qualified automatically as hosts, but the tournament has since been moved to North Macedonia and no CONIFA member is hosting, so it was unclear whether Somaliland has still qualified. Not all CONIFA members entered qualification, and in the continents of Africa and South America, an equal number of teams entered compared to the number of berths available, so all entrants from those continents qualified automatically. ===Qualified teams=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- !

On 29 April 2020 the CONIFA Executive Committee announced through its social media channels that the competition was cancelled, with no rescheduling, and the organisation outlining plans to expand continental competitions in the future by redirecting funding from the 2020 World Football Cup from sponsors Sportsbet.io. ==Notes== ==References== Category:ConIFA World Football Cup CONIFA CONIFA CONIFA CONIFA World Football Cup ",
