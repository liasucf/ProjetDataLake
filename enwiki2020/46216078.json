The length of the forewings is about 12 mm for males and about 12.5 mm for females. The forewings have a double postmedial and single subterminal and terminal fasciae. The distal line of the postmedial fascia is thin and pale brown and the proximal line is reduced to dark brown spots. The subterminal fascia is light brown and the terminal fascia dark brown, sometimes reduced to spots between the veins.
