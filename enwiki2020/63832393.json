The Institute history dates back from 1952, when it was founded as Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso (PUCV) and decided to create alongside a new institute, the Pedagogy in English School. With the goal of organising the School of History, the Institute hired University of Chile scholar H\u00e9ctor Herrera Cajas. In 1957, the Institute had its first complement when the Superior Council approved the creation of Crescente Err\u00e1zuriz Institute. That institution was dedicated to Ecclesiastical History research. Its first director was Guillermo Monckeberg.PUCV Superior Council. University Council's session minutes. Valpara\u00edso, July 1st, 1957. The Crescente Err\u00e1zuriz Institute was dedicated was dedicated to the study of old parish records from Melipilla, La Ligua, Petorca, Casablanca, Valpara\u00edso, Calbuco, Puerto Montt, La Uni\u00f3n, Tacna and Arica. The experimental University reform undertaken by PUCV during the period 1967\u20131969 had as effect suppression of the old teaching faculties, and for this reason the Social Sciences and History School became an autonomous academic unit. It was renamed as History and Geography Institute and was under History and Geography Department structure. Subsequently, on July 25, 1972, a Decree issued by Rectory established the division of History and Geography Institute into two different academic units. The Master's degree in History was created in 1983. This postgraduate degree is generally attended by students from careers such as law, philosophy, literature, among others. It includes three main areas of study: Economic and Social History, Political History and Cultural History. After first semester, the student must choose one of three options. Likewise, the Institute also offers a PhD in History under inspiration of training \"professionals capable of building new historiographical knowledge and who possess theoretical and methodological guidelines in the discipline and in the interdisciplinary field\". ==History== Caption from Paseo Valle The pedagogical and humanistic growth of Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso was not part of its objectives when it was inaugurated in 1928, but focused on technical and commercial studies. In the late 1940s, the Faculty of Philosophy and Education was created, opening with Mathematics, Physics, Spanish and Philosophy schools. Seeking to reinforce the university's pedagogy and humanities studies, in 1952, Rector Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez F\u00f6rster SJ, created the School of History and Geography as part of the mentioned pedagogical faculty. Under Ra\u00fal Montes SJ, direction, and with a reduced teaching body made up of Professors Rafael Gandolfo (SS.CC), Guillermo M\u00f6nckeberg (SDB), Juan Monted\u00f3nico and A\u00edda Chaparro Galdames, an initial enrolment of 30 students had to be accommodated, without having an adequate library for academic requirements.S\u00edntesis hist\u00f3rica The real institutional and academic organization of the School occurred in 1955 when Professor H\u00e9ctor Herrera Cajas, from Universidad de Chile, assumed position as director. The Students Center was created that year and the following year both the Teaching Council and the teaching assistantships began to function. Likewise, that year the teaching staff reached its full complement: Raimundo Barros SJ., Romolo Trebbi del Trevigiano, Fernando Manr\u00edquez, Jorge Siles Salinas, Oscar Fabres, Florencio Rivera and teachers Mar\u00eda Teresa Cobos Noriega and Mar\u00eda Eugenia del Valle. In the following years saw R\u00f3mulo Santana, Mario Orellana, Julius Spinner, Lajos Janosa, Marco Antonio Huesbe and Mario G\u00f3ngora join as lecturers. At that time, the School was located in Valpara\u00edso's Casa Central. The students Reform Movement suffered a drastic conclusion following 1973 Military Coup led by General Augusto Pinochet against President Salvador Allende's marxist government.Don Mabry, Allende's Rise and Fall. The Military Junta, Pinochet dictatorship's mainstay, appointed new university authorities until 1990 when christian\u2013democrat Patricio Aylwin assumed Presidency of the Republic on 11 March 1990. In 1976, university faculties were recreated again, and the History Institute returned to its position within Faculty of Philosophy and Education. After Reform, the Institute is based in researching and formation of high-school teachers. In addition to scholastic renewal of the staff, it demanded postgraduate studies for the future teachers. From 1985 to date, the History Institute is located at Palacio Valle around Alvares Avenue in Vina Del Mar. ==See also== * Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara\u00edso * H\u00e9ctor Herrera Cajas ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso Category:History institutes Category:History departments in Chile Category:History organisations based in Chile ",
