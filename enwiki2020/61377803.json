    "text": "People's Policy Project (abbreviated 3P) is a United States-based crowd-funded think tank that works on social, economic and political equity issues. It has been described as \"left-leaning\", \"left-wing\", \"democratic socialist-leaning\", and \"socialist\". The founder and president of 3P is Matt Bruenig, a former lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board and contributor to the US think- tank Demos. ==Funding== People's Policy Project relies on small-dollar donations for funding. All funding is done through small donors on crowdfunding websites such as Patreon, which is primarily used by artists and entertainers to coordinate small recurring donations from large numbers of supporters. This contrasts with standard funding models, which include large donations from institutions or private individuals, or paid consulting work.Weidenbaum, M. (2009). The Competition of Ideas: the world of the washington think tanks. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. ==Projects== 3P focuses on several areas of social democratic and market socialist policy in its projects. The \"Social Wealth Fund for America\" paper advocates for public ownership of capital through gradual accumulation of all capital into a publicly-owned Social Wealth Fund, called the American Solidarity Fund, in which each citizen of the US holds a non-transferable dividend-paying share; effectively providing a universal basic dividend. The \"Family Fun Pack\" paper advocates for a substantial suite of Nordic-style child welfare policies: a baby box, parental leave, free child care, free pre-kindergarten, free school lunch, free health care, and a child benefit. This project is targeted at eliminating child poverty, and removing economic concerns from family planning. The \"Fighting Climate Change with a Green TVA\" paper advocates for including a massive de-carbonization and expansion of the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of the Green New Deal, in order to shrink greenhouse gas emissions and create public jobs. ==Leadership== *Matt Bruenig is the current president. ==References== Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States Category:Progressive organizations in the United States ",
