The building involved was extensively damaged, but there were no fatalities in the accident. ==Accident== At 12:05 p.m. the twin engined Hornet launched from runway 05R at Naval Air Station Oceana on a heading of 053 degrees, conducting a scheduled training exercise. Within seconds of becoming airborne the right engine experienced a failure. The crew immediately selected maximum thrust on the left engine, but it too failed. Losing altitude, the crew then began dumping fuel to lighten the stricken aircraft and reduce the risk of fire. When the Hornet reached altitude above ground level (agl) in a nose high attitude, the pilots ejected. One eyewitness, a former Navy SEAL, spoke with Navy Times. He said, \"the pilots ejected at the last possible second in an apparent effort to make sure that the plane would not crash into a nearby school\".http://www.thewire.com/national/2012/04/f-18-crashes- virginia-beach/50837/ Retrieved February 18, 2015 The F/A-18 plowed into the Mayfair Mews apartment complex that houses about 100 residents, located less than from the departure end of the runway.

There was debris falling in our parking lot. One pilot fell into the apartment complex next to ours. He was all bloody, but conscious.\u201d A resident said his house started shaking and then the power went out, as he saw a red and orange blaze outside his window. He ran outside, where he saw billowing black smoke and then came upon the pilot as he ran to a friend's home. \"I saw the parachute on the house and he was still connected to it, and he was laying on the ground with his face full of blood\", he told a television news reporter. \"The pilot said, `I'm sorry for destroying your house.'\"https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/navy-f-18-crash_n_1408536.
