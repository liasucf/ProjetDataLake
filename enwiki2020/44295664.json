    "text": "Workforce casualisation is the process in which employment shifts from a preponderance of full-time and permanent positions to casual and contract positions. In Australia, 35% of all workers are casual or contract employees who are not paid for sick leave or annual leave. In the United Kingdom, 53% of academics teaching or doing research in British universities manage on some form of insecure, non-permanent contract, ranging from short-term contracts that typically elapse within nine months, to those paid by the hour to give classes or mark essays and exams. == See also == * Casual work * Change management * Contingent workforce * Contingent work * Gig economy * Permatemp * Precariat * Precarious work * Temporary work * Zero-hour contract == References == Category:Employment classifications Category:Labor relations Category:Precarious work ",
