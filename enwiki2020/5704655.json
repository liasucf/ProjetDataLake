Annually over 100,000 people visit the spectacle, which takes place in Leipzig (Germany) at the end of July. The Fiesta is organised by a local Marketing agency, co-partner is the City of Leipzig. In 1995 the first Balloon Fiesta attracted 5000 visitors as a local event in M\u00fcgeln. In 1996 the festival was relocated to a recreation area close to Leipzig called \u201eSilbersee\u201c. This area lies beyond the air lanes of Leipzig. The spacious recreation area \u201eSilbersee\u201c is situated between the urban areas of Loessnig (a district of Leipzig) and the open-pit landscape in the southern areas of Leipzig, which is currently in a process of recultivation and transfiguration. The public park \u201eSilbersee\u201c has room for over one hundred balloons. Competitions between the hot-air balloons are essential at the Saxonia International Balloon Fiesta. The different kinds of competition- flights are: Fox hunting, Key grab and flying as far as possible. Most of the balloons are sponsored by large companies. ==See also== *Hot air balloon *Hot air balloon festivals ==External links== *Homepage of the Saxonia International Balloon Fiesta Category:Events in Leipzig Category:Hot air balloon festivals Category:Tourist attractions in Leipzig Category:Sports festivals in Germany Category:Sport in Halle (Saale) ",
