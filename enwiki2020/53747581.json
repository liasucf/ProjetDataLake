    "text": "\"Pride\" (stylized as \"PRIDE.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, taken from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The seventh track on the album (eighth on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was written by Lamar, Steve Lacy, Anna Wise, and Anthony Tiffith, and produced by Lacy and Tiffith, with additional production by B\u0113kon. \"Pride\" charted in multiple countries in 2017. The song features background vocals from producer Steve Lacy and singer Anna Wise, the latter having previously collaborated with Lamar on \"These Walls\", which won her a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. == Writing == The song features songwriting collaborations from American singer Anna Wise who, prior to her work on \"Pride\", won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2016 with Lamar for his song \"These Walls\", from his third studio album To Pimp a Butterfly. == Production == According to producer Steve Lacy, he created the beat for \"Pride\" on his iPhone 6. Lacy also said that before the song's release, it was originally titled \"Wasn't There\" before being renamed to \"Pride\". The song has a tempo of 139 BPM and is in the key of E minor. == Critical reception == In a mixed review, Maeve McDermott of USA Today said the song was not that memorable, but its enjoyable mix of influences make it worth listening to. == Lost verse == Shortly after the release of Damn, a lost handwritten verse from \"Pride\" was released by the co-president of Top Dawg Entertainment, Punch, on his Instagram page. The lost verse reads as follows: :Pride is my biggest sin :I tried to fight it but I never win :Lay\u2019n myself down in the beds I made :Karma is always knockin with capital K\u2019s :It started when I was toss\u2019n my life in the sand :Cross\u2019n the street, momma don\u2019t you hold my hand :Time revealing itself :My ways are magnified :Same patterns requiring that I never camouflaged :Looking at me in shock you found my identity :Asking yourself do I have room 4 empathy :Everything is subject 2 change :But not me == Live performances == Lamar performed \"Pride\" live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 23, 2017. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Lamar \u2013 songwriter *Steve Lacy \u2013 songwriter, producer, background vocals *Anna Wise \u2013 songwriter, background vocals *Anthony Tiffith \u2013 songwriter, producer *B\u0113kon \u2013 additional production, additional vocals *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mixing, mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 35 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 34 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by Steve Lacy (guitarist) Category:Songs written by Anna Wise ",
