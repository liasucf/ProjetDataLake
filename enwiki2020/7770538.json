    "text": "The 1949\u201350 United States network television schedule began in September of 1949 and ended in the spring of 1950. This was the first season in which all four networks offered at least some prime time programming all seven nights of the week. The schedule below reflects the fall lineup as it all settled into place throughout October 1949, before any subsequent time changes were made and additional new series appeared in November. New fall series are highlighted in bold. Notable debuts during the season included The Plainclothesman with its unusual camera work, the popular The Lone Ranger (which is one of the few 1940s television series to be given a DVD release), The Ed Wynn Show (a short-lived series featuring popular performers as guests and the first variety show from the West Coast), and the unsuccessful series The Life of Riley, one of the first sitcoms to be produced on film as opposed to live transmission. Continuing from the prior season were the highly popular variety series Toast of the Town, the critically well-received and popular anthology series Studio One, the critically panned but popular Captain Video and His Video Rangers which was one of the earliest sci-fi TV series, the well received by critics and viewers anthology series Kraft Television Theater, the popular Kukla, Fran and Ollie, and the popular in some regions drama/comedy The Goldbergs (which is also one of the few 1940s television series to be given a DVD release). == Fall Schedule == === Sunday === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;margin-right:0;text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13%;\" |Network ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:30 p.m. |- ! colspan=\"2\" | ABC | Stained Glass Windows | ABC Penthouse Players | Think Fast | The Little Revue | colspan=\"2\" | Let There Be Stars | Celebrity Time | Youth on the March |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | CBS !Fall | Tonight on Broadway | rowspan=\"2\" | This Is Show Business | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Toast of the Town | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | The Fred Waring Show | rowspan=\"2\" | (10:00) The Week in Review (10:15) Local Programming | rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#abbfff\" | Local Programming |- !Mid-season | Starlight Theatre |- ! colspan=\"2\" | DMN | colspan=\"2\" | Front Row Center | Chicagoland Mystery Players | Cinema Varieties | colspan=\"2\" | Cross Question | colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#abbfff\" | Local Programming |- ! colspan=\"2\" | NBC | Leave It to the Girls | The Aldrich Family | The Chesterfield Supper Club | Colgate Theatre | colspan=\"2\" | The Philco Television Playhouse | Garroway at Large | bgcolor=\"#abbfff\" | Local Programming |} === Monday === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;margin- right:0;text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:13%;\"|Network ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|7:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|8:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:11.5%;\"|9:30 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:00 p.m. ! style=\"width:10%;\"|10:30 p.m. |- !
