    "text": "A Portuguese Pointer, () is a breed of dog developed as a gun dog. It is one of several pointing breeds and is mainly used in red-legged partridge hunting. == History == The Portuguese Pointer (perdigueiro Portugu\u00eas) arose from Iberian hunting dogs with its presence in Portugal traceable to the early twelfth century. Initially the dog was bred in royal kennels and later became a very popular hunting dog for the lower classes of society. In the eighteenth century, many English families established a presence in the region of Oporto in the business of wine production and came to know the Portuguese hunting breed which was taken to England where they played a part in the origin of the English pointer. However, during the nineteenth century when Portugal was experiencing considerable social hardships, the breed began a progressive decline. It was not until the 1920s when some breeders made an effort to salvage the breed by locating some of the ancient Portuguese dogs in the inaccessible north of Portugal. The Portuguese pedigree book was then established in 1932 and breed standard in 1938. For at least a thousand years, this dog has always had the same square head, a marked stop, triangular ears and compact look and since the 17th century, the same docked tail, and among pointing dogs all over the world just the perdigueiro and his \"son\" the English pointer have this kind of skull-facial convergence so typical. ==Description== A female Portuguese Pointer === Size & Build === The Portuguese Pointer is a dog of medium proportions.
