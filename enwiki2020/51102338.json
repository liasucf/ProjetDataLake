He joined Benfica in 1938, winning one league and a cup in five years there. He then moved to Estoril Praia, staying there for 14 years. ==Career== Born in Alhos Vedros, El\u00f3i started at Barreirense, before moving to Benfica in 1938, making his debut at the hands of J\u00e1nos Biri on 8 October 1939, against Belenenses. He went on to appear in every game that Benfica played in that season, making 35 appearances, many of those alongside Gaspar Pinto, helping the club win the 1939\u201340 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal. His partnership with Gaspar Pinto was kept in 1940\u201341, but without the same success, as Benfica did not win anything. Still, he played every game possible, making 31 appearances. In 1941\u201342 he battled for a first team place with Ricardo Freire, appearing in 6 league games, as Benfica won the league. El\u00f3i left the club in 1942 after playing in 75 games, subsequently starting a long career at Estoril Praia. ==Honours== Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1941\u201342 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1939\u201340 ==References== General * Specific ==External links== Category:1920 births Category:Possibly living people Category:People from Moita Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:F.C.
