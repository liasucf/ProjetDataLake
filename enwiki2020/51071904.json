He came to South Africa in 1902 and started farming near Ottoshoop on a farm he called Malemani aka Malmani after the original seTswana name of the area, \"Molemane\", which means \"place of much water\". Fluorspar was discovered on his farm. Gubbins spent his life assembling Africana in the form of old books, pictures and manuscripts. A disastrous fire on Christmas Eve 1931 at the Witwatersrand University destroyed 35,000 books, and half of Gubbins' Africana collection. Fearing for the safety of his collection on the farm due to grassfires, Gubbins had started with its relocating to Johannesburg. Undeterred, Gubbins and his patrons immediately started on a new collection which eventually became the Gubbins Library and the nucleus of Johannesburg's Africana Museum. He was director of this Museum until his death. The University conferred an honorary D.Litt. on him. ==Works== *Raven's fire: a novel by John Gaspard Gubbins (2013) *Profound river - John Gaspard Gubbins (2011) *Three- dimensional thinking - John Gaspard Gubbins (1924) http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n78001345/ ==References== ==External links== *John Gaspard Gubbins Papers 1877-1981 *\"A Place That Matters Yet: John Gubbins's MuseumAfrica in the Postcolonial World\" - Sara Byala *\"Two Worlds Collide: John Gaspard Gubbins in South Africa, 1902\u20131924\" - Sara Byala * John Gaspard Gubbins, South Africa's North-West Province - A Guide to its History and Heritage Category:Museum founders Category:South African male novelists Category:1877 births Category:1935 deaths Category:South African non-fiction writers ",
