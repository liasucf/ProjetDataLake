Erected from 1695 to 1706 according to plans by Johann Arnold Nering, Martin Gr\u00fcnberg, Andreas Schl\u00fcter and Jean de Bodt in Baroque style, it was later converted into a Prussian Hall of Fame. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the Zeughaus was rebuilt from 1949 to 1967 as part of the Forum Fridericianum.Zeughaus (in German) Landesdenkmalamt Berlin Since 2003, it has been home to the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historic Museum). ==History== The Zeughaus is the oldest structure at Unter den Linden. It was built by Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg between 1695 and 1730 in the Baroque style, to be used as an artillery arsenal for the display of cannons from Brandenburg and Prussia. The first building master was Johann Arnold Nering. After his death in 1695, he was followed by Martin Gr\u00fcnberg, then Andreas Schl\u00fcter and finally Jean de Bodt. Andreas Schl\u00fcter designed the keystones above the round-arch windows in the form of heads of giants. Georg Friedrich Hitzig (1811-1881) constructed the monumental flight of steps to the upper floor of the north wing and also a roof over the courtyard.. The building was converted into a military museum in 1875. In March 1943, Rudolf von Gersdorff tried, but failed to assassinate by suicide bombing Adolf Hitler, during the opening of an exhibition in this museum. From 1949-65 the Zeughaus was restored after heavy war damage, the interior being completely redesigned. In 1952, the government of the German Democratic Republic opened the Museum of German History (Museum f\u00fcr Deutsche Geschichte) in the Zeughaus, which presented the history of Germany, especially in the modern era, from a Communist point of view. Today, the Zeughaus is the site of the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum).
