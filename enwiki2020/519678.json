Like other Japanese professional knives, usuba are chisel ground, and have a bevel on the front side, and have a hollow ground urasuki on the back side. Usuba characteristically have a flat edge, with little or no curve, and are tall, to allow knuckle clearance when chopping on a cutting board. Usuba literally means \"thin blade\" indicating its relative thinness compared to other knives, required for cutting through firm vegetables without cracking them. Due to its height and straight edge, usuba are also used for specialized cuts such as katsuramuki, shaving a vegetable cylinder into a thin sheet.Photo of an usuba knife The Usuba b\u014dch\u014d is used by professionals and differs from the related Nakiri b\u014dch\u014d, which is preferred for home use. While the nakiri b\u014dch\u014d's cutting blade is sharpened from both sides, the usuba b\u014dch\u014d's blade is sharpened only from one side, a style known as kataba in Japanese. This kataba style edge gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the ry\u014dba used for nakiri b\u014dch\u014d, but requires more skill to use. The highest quality kataba blades have a slight depression on the flat side. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right hand use of the knife, but knives sharpened on the left side are available for left hand use. The usuba b\u014dch\u014d is heavier than a nakiri b\u014dch\u014d, although still much lighter than a deba b\u014dch\u014d. There are several variations of the usuba b\u014dch\u014d. The Kanto variation has a square blunt tip, making it appear like a small meat cleaver. The Kansai, kamagata style variation has a spine that drops down to the edge at the tip, allowing the usuba to do fine delicate work. However, this tip is also delicate and can be broken easily. The usuba is particularly popular with Kyoto chefs, who use the Kamagata usuba for most of their work. Since Kyoto is landlocked, they rely more heavily on vegetables than Tokyo, making the usuba the quintessential knife of professional chefs there. In Kyoto cuisine, the versatile tip allows for intricate cuts and preparations.Photo of an usuba knife == References == Category:Japanese kitchen knives ",
