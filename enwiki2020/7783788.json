The site also has significant evidence of human activity spanning an estimated 11,000 years. The town of Pompeys Pillar was first planned out as a railroad station within the Huntley Project, an irrigation project managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. A Catholic church and a Union Congregational church once existed in Pompeys Pillar. The Northern Pacific Railroad connected the town to Billings, about 29 miles southwest. A post office currently operates in the community. Pompeys Pillar National Monument was created in 2001 and placed under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. In 2006 a new visitor's center and museum complex opened, coinciding with the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
