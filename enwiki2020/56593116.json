    "text": "Felger & Massarotti (or Felger & Mazz) is a Marconi Award-winning afternoon radio show hosted by Michael Felger and Tony Massarotti, airing from 2 to 6 pm in Boston, Massachusetts. The show first aired on August 13, 2009 with the launch of WBZ-FM's sports talk radio station, The Sports Hub on 98.5 FM. The show is known for its negative demeanor towards local sports teams, hot takes, and willingness to go after local teams and players. The show's negativity towards local teams led to a famous bashing of the Boston Red Sox following the departure of two-time World Series champion manager Terry Francona, which resulted in Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry barging into the show in an attempt to defend his team. The show's negativity and bravado have also resulted in several controversies, most notable among them when Felger mocked the deaths of Roy Halladay and Dale Earnhardt. For all the show's negativity, however, it has also been associated with several Boston charities including Cuts for a Cause and Christmas in the City. The radio show features a simulcast television show that airs on NBC Sports Boston. The simulcast debuted on November 14, 2011 on Comcast SportsNet New England, which was later renamed NBC Sports Boston. Originally owned by CBS Sports Radio, The Sports Hub was sold to Beasley Broadcast Group in November 2017. Felger & Mazz has been a dominant broadcast since its debut in 2009, and has held the top spot for afternoon programming in the Nielsen ratings with the coveted \"men aged 25\u201354\" market since 2012. ==Show members== * Michael Felger \u2013 host * Tony Massarotti \"Mazz\" \u2013 co-host * \"Big\" Jim Murray \u2013 sports headlines/fill-in co- host * James Stewart \"J-Stew\" \u2013 executive producer * Dan \"The Angry Call Screener\" Lifshatz \u2013 producer/call screener * Billy Lanni \u2013 director of communications/call screener * Christopher L.
