Retrieved on June 27, 2010. \"MIAT building, Buyant-Ukhaa 45 Ulaanbaatar 210134, Mongolia\" The airline operates international scheduled services from its base at Chinggis Khaan International Airport near Ulaanbaatar. == History == Boeing 727-200 Airbus A310-300 === Communist era === MIAT Mongolian Airlines was established in 1956. It began operations with the help of Aeroflot and began flights on 7 July 1956 using an Antonov An-2 from Ulaanbaatar to Irkutsk. The airline also used Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-14s for flights to international destinations like Beijing and Moscow. During the 1960s and 1970s, the airline obtained Antonov An-24 and An-26 twin turboprops. A Tupolev Tu-154 jet on lease from Aeroflot was introduced in the late 1980s. === Post-communist era === In 1992, MIAT bought five Chinese Harbin Y-12 commuter aircraft and acquired a Boeing 727-200 from Korean Air, one more following in 1994. An Airbus A310 was leased in 1998, and a new Boeing 737 was leased in 2002 to replace the aging 727-200 fleet. Between 2003 and 2008, MIAT's An-24 and An-26 fleet was gradually retired. In April 2008, MIAT received its second Boeing 737-800 aircraft on lease from CIT Aerospace. In July 2008, MIAT ended scheduled domestic flights completely. In June 2009, the airline temporarily resumed scheduled domestic flights to M\u00f6r\u00f6n and Khovd using its Boeing 737-800 aircraft.UB Post: MIAT Company Expands Domestic and International Flights , accessed May 29th, 2009. In late 2009, MIAT flew charter flights to Hong Kong and Sanya, a popular resort city in Hainan, China. In June 2010, the airline's flights were brought to a halt due to a mechanics' strike. However, the situation was resolved with the replacement of the CEO and Technical Director. In early 2011, MIAT signed an agreement with Air Lease Corporation to lease two former China Eastern Boeing 767-300ERs until 2013. The first aircraft entered service in May 2011 with the second following in November 2011. In 2011 the Airbus A310 was retired after serving MIAT Mongolian Airlines for 13 years. In June 2011, MIAT began regular flights to Hong Kong. The company also ordered three aircraft, a Boeing 767-300ER and two Boeing 737-800s, to be delivered in 2013 and 2016 respectively. The order marks the first time in two decades that MIAT has chosen to expand its fleet by purchasing new aircraft straight from the manufacturer rather than leasing them. In January 2019, MIAT announced flights to Shanghai and Guangzhou in China to start from summer of 2019. In addition, it announced the leasing of 3 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to be delivered in January, May, and October 2019, thereby replacing two of its aircraft whose leases are due to expire in 2019, together with the implementation of a self- checkin system. In December 2019, MIAT announced its first Boeing 787-9 aircraft are to be delivered in spring of 2021. On the 21st of June 2020, MIAT flew for the first time in history to the United States. With a Boeing 767-300, they flew from Ulaanbaatar to Seattle, which is the first non-stop between Mongolia and the United States in history.https://simpleflying.com/mogolian-airlines-us-non-stop-flight/ == Destinations == === Codeshare agreements === MIAT Mongolian Airlines has codeshare agreements with the following airlines: *Aeroflot *Cathay Pacific * Japan Airlines *Korean Air == Fleet == A Mongolian Airlines Boeing 737-800 A Mongolian Airlines Boeing 767-300ER ===Current fleet=== As of October 2019, MIAT Mongolian Airlines operates an all-Boeing fleet consisting of the following aircraft:https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/55926-miat-sub- leases-oman-airs-only-b737-700 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse;text-align:center\" |+ MIAT Mongolian Airlines fleet |- !rowspan=2|Aircraft !rowspan=2|In service !rowspan=2|Orders !colspan=4|Passengers !rowspan=2|Notes |- !C !W !Y !Total |- |rowspan=2|Boeing 737-800 |rowspan=2|3 |rowspan=2|-- |12 |-- |150 |162 |rowspan=2| |- |12 |-- |162 |174 |- |Boeing 737 MAX 8 |1 |3 |12 |-- |150 |162https://www.ch- aviation.com/portal/news/75069-miat-mongolian-airlines-adds-first-b737-max-8 | |- |rowspan=2|Boeing 767-300ER |rowspan=2|2 |rowspan=2|-- |18 |-- |245 |263 |rowspan=2| |- |25 |-- |195 |220 |- |Boeing 787-9 |-- |1 |16 |21 |276 |313 |To be delivered in spring 2021 |- !Total !6 !4 !colspan=5| |} ===Former fleet=== MIAT has previously operated a variety of aircraft types, including: * Airbus A310-300 * Antonov An-2 * Antonov An-24 * Antonov An-26 * Antonov An-30 * Boeing 727-200 * Boeing 737-700 * Harbin Y-12 * Ilyushin Il-14 * Kamov Ka-26 * Mil Mi-4 * Mil Mi-8 * Polikarpov Po-2 * Tupolev Tu-154 * Yakovlev Yak-12 ==Accidents and incidents== MIAT Mongolian Airlines has suffered the following incidents and accidents since commencing operations: *4 August 1963: Avia 14 Super MT-105 crashed into the side of Otgontenger Mountain. *17 September 1973: Antonov An-24B BNMAU-4206 crashed into the side of a mountain in the Hovd Province of Mongolia during approach. *1 May 1979: Antonov An-24B BNMAU-1202 ran off the runway on landing at Erdenet Airport. *26 January 1990: Antonov 24RV BNMAU-10208 crashed into terrain near Ulaangom Airport at night, killing all 30 on board. *23 April 1993: Antonov An-26 BNMAU-14102 flying from Buyant Ukhaa Airport, Ulaanbaatar crashed into the side of Marz Mountain during descent into Tosontsengel Airport, Mongolia.
