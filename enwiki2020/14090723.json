There is a large Gorzan\u00f3w Castle in the village. It lies approximately north of Bystrzyca K\u0142odzka, south of K\u0142odzko, and south of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw. The village has a population of 921. ==Name and history== Saint Anthony chapel The earliest name of the locality seems to have been the German appellation Arnoldsdorf (or Arnsdorf), derived from the personal name Arnold (+dorf), probably the name of the Lokator who brought German farmers to the village. The later German name of Grafenort derives from the noble title Graf (+ort, \"locality\"). In the seventeenth century the owner of the village was Johann Gundacker Graf von Heberstein. The name \"Gorzan\u00f3w\" was introduced officially only after 1945.Nazwy miejscowe Polski: historia, pochodzenie, zmiany, ed. K. Rymut, vol. 3 (EI, ed. Urszula Bijak, et al.), Cracow, Wydawnictwo IJP PAN (Institute of the Polish Language of the Polish Academy of Sciences), 1999, p. 251\\. , . The name \"Gorzan\u00f3w\" appears in the standard gazetteer of Polish place-names, the S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego (vol. 7, p. 239, col. 1), only with reference to a Polish village in the Podolia, a different geographical region. The village discussed in the present article is listed under the name Grafenort (S\u0142ownik geograficzny, vol. 2, p. 791, col. 1), without a corresponding Polish toponymic. The history of the village dates back to the 12th century, when a defensive stronghold existed at the site.Waldemar Brygier, Tomasz Dudziak, et al., Ziemia K\u0142odzka: przewodnik dla prawdziwego turysty, Piast\u00f3w, Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, 2010, p. 328\\. . In the Middle Ages at various times it was part of Poland or Kingdom of Bohemia. Probably in the 14th century a royal castle was built, which was destroyed in 1470, and the remains were dismantled around 1804. It was annexed by Prussia in the 18th century and from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany. The S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego states that, historically, theatrical performances were staged at \"the beautiful castle of the Hebersteins\" three times a week for eight months of the year, and that the place was known for its \"steam baths\". The village had a Catholic church, and a chapel dedicated to St. Anthony surmounting a hill of the same name, which rises to the height of 1,053 feet above sea level. The location is described as \"utterly exquisite\" (prze\u015bliczne po\u0142o\u017cenie).S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego, vol. 2, p. 791, col. 1. During the Second World War the Nazis established a concentration camp on the premises of the palace,Waldemar Brygier, Tomasz Dudziak, et al., Ziemia K\u0142odzka: przewodnik dla prawdziwego turysty, Piast\u00f3w, Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, 2010, p. 329\\. . a satellite camp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. A present-day guidebook describes the \"palace of Gorzan\u00f3w\" as being in a complete state of dilapidation, unfit to accommodate sightseers.Waldemar Brygier, Tomasz Dudziak, et al., Ziemia K\u0142odzka: przewodnik dla prawdziwego turysty, Piast\u00f3w, Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, 2010, p. 219\\. . ==Gallery== 2014 Zamek w Gorzanowie 5.jpg|Castle 2015 Wiejski O\u015brodek Kultury w Gorzanowie.JPG|Culture centre 2014 Gorzan\u00f3w, figura \u015bw.
