    "text": "Seychellois Creole, also known as kreol, is the French-based creole language of the Seychelles. It shares official language status with English and French (in contrast to Mauritian and R\u00e9union Creole, which lack official status in Mauritius and France). == Description == Since its independence in 1976, the government of the Seychelles has sought to develop the language, with its own orthography and codified grammar, establishing Lenstiti Kreol (the Creole Institute) for this purpose. {| class=\"IPA wikitable\" !

Gloss | We || ||all || need || to || work || together || to || create || our || future |} In several Seychellois Creole words derived from French, the French definite article (le, la and les) has become part of the word; for example, 'future' is lavenir (French l'avenir). The possessive is the same as the pronoun, so that 'our future' is nou lavenir. Similarly in the plural, les \u00celes \u00c9loign\u00e9es Seychelles in French ('the Outer Seychelles Islands') has become Zil Elwanyen Sesel in Creole. Note the z in Zil, as, in French, les \u00celes is pronounced /le.z\u203fil/. == Samples == (Lord's Prayer) :Ou, nou papa ki dan lesyel, :Fer ou ganny rekonnet konman Bondye. :Ki ou renny i arive. :Ki ou lavolonte i ganny realize :Lo later parey i ete dan lesyel :Donn nou sak zour nou dipen ki nou bezwen. :Pardonn nou pour bann lofans :Ki noun fer anver ou, :Parey nou pardonn sa ki n ofans nou. :Pa les tantasyon domin nou, :Me tir nou dan lemal. 49 fables of La Fontaine were adapted to the dialect around 1900 by Rodolphine Young (1860\u20131932) but these remained unpublished until 1983.Fables de La Fontaine traduites en cr\u00e9ole seychellois, Hamburg, 1983; there is also a selection at Potomitan.info While Seychellois laws are written in English, the working language of the National Assembly is Creole and the verbatim record of its meetings provides an extensive corpus for its contemporary use in a formal setting.National Assembly - Hansard - Verbatim (See also Koste Seselwa, the national anthem.) ==Notes== ==References== * D'Offay, Danielle & Lionnet, Guy, Diksyonner Kreol - Franse / Dictionnaire Cr\u00e9ole Seychellois - Fran\u00e7ais.
