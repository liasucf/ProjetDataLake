    "text": "Trentino \u2013 the Autonomous Province of Trento Trentino refers to the southern part of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino region and its capital is Trento (the ancient Roman Tridentum). ==Winemaking== One main distinction between Trentino and South Tyrol wine production is the fact that in the northern area (South Tyrol) the wines are produced mostly by small family- owned and managed wineries that sell their high quality wine mainly locally with limited exports to Germany and Austria. Trentino on the other hand counts on a large number of growers who joined into large cooperatives, such as Cavit and Mezzacorona, which produce wines that have consistent taste and characteristics year after year. These wines are popular, both in Italy and abroad, among wine drinkers who look for reasonably good and affordable wines for daily enjoyment.http://www.winecountry.it/regions/trentino/ Wine making in Trentino Vineyards in Valdadige DOC ==Varieties== Three grapes are native to this region: one is the white Nosiola and the other two are the red Teroldego Rotaliano and the Marzemino. Trentino D.O.C. Nosiola is made from the eponymous vine grown on the hillsides of Valle dei Laghi and Val di Cembra. Amongst other things, its partially dried grapes are used to make the Trentino D.O.C. Vino Santo from Trentino. In addition to the native grapes, well known international grape varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet, Merlot, Moscato, Pinot Nero and Pinot Grigio, as well as M\u00fcller-Thurgau, are grown throughout the region.http://www.visittrentino.it/en/articolo/dett/i-vini-del-trentino Trentino wines ==Trentino DOC regions== Landscape of the Trentino wine region The following is a list of DOCs in the Trentino region along with the grapes that may be included in the blend under varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label.P.
