    "text": "Kimmage Development Studies Centre (DSC) was a private third level institution based at Kimmage Manor, in Dublin, Ireland from 1974 to July 2018. It provided courses in Development Studies since 1974 as well as other training courses aimed at the International Development Sector, development practitioners and activists. In July 2018 the academic and professional training programmes of Kimmage DSC were transferred to a newly established Department of International Development at Maynooth University, Ireland's first department of this kind. The company formerly known as Kimmage DSC changed its name to the Shanahan Research Group. SRG has continued to operate from Kimmage Manor, supporting doctoral research in international development. ==Programmes== === Academic Programmes === Academic programmes offered by Kimmage DSC and now available from the Department of International Development at Maynooth University reflect a combination of formal and non-formal educational methodologies and are run at undergraduate (BA) and post graduate (MA and Post Graduate Diploma) levels, with options to study on a full-time or part-time basis. Modules from the MA in International Development are also available to students on-line through a Flexible and Distance Learning (FDL) mode of delivery. From September 2016 this MA programme is accredited by Maynooth University. Prior to this date, its MA programme (previously named an MA in Development Studies) was internationally accredited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. Kimmage DSC also provided a BA in International Development in collaboration with Maynooth University, as part of their undergraduate programme from 2013 to 2018. This programme is also now delivered by the Department of International Development at Maynooth University. === Capacity Development Services === In addition to its academic programmes, Kimmage DSC provided capacity development services devoted to the professional upgrading of Irish and overseas-based international development personnel. These capacity development services were provided as mentoring and organisational support and the provision of short-term practical training either through classroom-based training or open and distance education (KODE). These services have been rebranded as the Research Engagement and Capacity Hub (REACH) in the new department. === Alliances === In addition to its collaborations with Maynooth University, Kimmage DSC developed activities and linkages with other like-minded organisations in the development sector in Ireland and internationally - most notably in Tanzania, South Africa and Vietnam. ==History== Kimmage Development Studies Centre was based at Kimmage Manor, in Dublin, Ireland from 1974 to 2018. It was established by the Irish Province of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit (also known as the Spiritans or the Holy Ghost Fathers) initially to provide education and training to intending overseas missionaries, where in addition to priestly formation they often took a degree at UCD. From 1978 onwards, to cater for the training needs of the growing development NGOs and volunteer sending agencies, the programme of studies welcomed participants of all backgrounds, cultures, nationalities, religious persuasions. To date, it has accommodated students from over 65 different countries, drawn mainly from Africa and Ireland but increasingly, also from Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2004 Kimmage DSC successfully tendered for an Irish Aid-funded contract to run a training and learning programme for the Irish development NGO and missionary sector. This programme (known as DTALK) was run by a consortium headed by Kimmage DSC which included the Dutch agency MDF, and the UK agency INTRAC. The programme continued to run until the contract ended in March 2012. Kimmage Open & Distance Education (KODE) was set up following the successful piloting of distance learning courses, primarily in East Africa, in 2007-2008. This was a tutor supported on-line professional training programme with courses ranging from 5 to 10 weeks duration. These courses were structured for learners to work through materials at their own pace and in their own time in subject areas including Results based Project Cycle Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, Governance and Accountability, Child Safeguarding in Development, Sustainable Livelihoods, HIV and Gender and Gender based Violence. In 2014, Kimmage DSC celebrated its 40th anniversary. To mark the occasion it produced and published Alumni Stories, 40 Years of Kimmage DSC. ==Kimmage Manor== Kimmage Manor in the centre of the campus is a 19th-century building formerly owned by Sir Frederick Shaw BL, the Recorder of the City of Dublin and former MP for Dublin City. In 1641 all the lands of Kimmage, Terenure and Milltown were in the hands of Peter Barnewall. At that time there was a castle in good repair on the lands of Kimmage. There were various owners and tenants through the years Rocque\u2019s map from the mid eighteenth century shows extensive buildings on the location of the present Manor House. In 1829 Frederick Shaw with his wife and family came to live in Kimmage. They occupied an \u2018L\u2019 shaped section of the present Manor building. This embraces the present Manor basement, the mezzanine floor used today as meeting room, classroom 3 and APA office. The top floor comprises the present staff office, classroom 4, administration office and MA coordinator\u2019s office. This \u2018L\u2019 shaped section is at least 250 years old. Within two years of their arrival the Shaw family had constructed a two storey addition to the south side of the \u2018L\u2019 shaped existing building and more than doubled their floor area. The front entrance, entrance hall, reception area and staircase were built. On the same floor reception rooms which later became classroom 1, the computer room, Friere room were added. Upstairs there were bedrooms which later became the assistant admin office, DEA office, the KDSC Director\u2019s office, the boardroom, and assistant director\u2019s office. These rooms are approximately one hundred and seventy five years old. The Shaw family had remodelled Kimmage House until it acquired its unique Tudor style with triangular gables, spiral turrets and tall chimneys and false window. Sir Frederick Shaw lived here until his death in 1876. His family moved to Bushy Park and Kimmage House was leased to various tenants. The Holy Ghost Fathers came to Kimmage in 1911 when they purchased the house and its 69 acres. There was significant development of the buildings in 1914, 1929 and in 1938 with the building of the church and facilities for Philosophy and Theology students. In 1974 this was to become Kimmage Development Studies Centre http://kimmagemanor.ie/ initially to provide education and training to intending overseas missionaries, and from 1978 onwards to cater for the training needs of the growing development NGOs and volunteer sending agencies. In 1991 the Kimmage Mission Institute of Theology and Cultures, was set up by the Spiritians and a number of other missionary organisations, this moved to the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy in 2003. In addition to the Manor building, Kimmage DSC also has student accommodation, a library and a student canteen on the Kimmage campus. ==External links== *Home page for the Department of International Development, Maynooth University *Kimmage Manor website *Kimmage DSC YouTube Channel ==References== Category:Universities and colleges in the Republic of Ireland Category:Catholic universities and colleges in the Republic of Ireland Category:Educational institutions established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Ireland Category:Kimmage ",
