It is located east of Blissfield on Township Road 25, in Clark Township, Coshocton County, Ohio. It was built by John Shrake and is a two-span wooden truss covered bridge. The bridge cost $2,107. It is asserted to be one of the oldest covered bridges in Ohio. \"It was an integral part of commerce in the village of Helmick during the early days. The bridge provided access to two grist mills used by farmers from as far as 25 miles away. Named for Congressman William Helmick of Tuscarawas County, the covered bridge was built by John Shrake of Newark, Ohio. The bridge fell into decay, and was closed in 1981. Citizens raised over $250,000 to restore the bridge and completed the project in 1996.\"Helmick Covered Bridge, youtube video, filmed 2016 by Vanessa Bechter ==See also== *Helmick Mill Covered Bridge, in Morgan County, Ohio, also NRHP-listed ==References== ==External links== *Helmick Covered Bridge, YouTube video, filmed 2016 by Vanessa Bechter Category:Covered bridges in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coshocton County, Ohio Category:Infrastructure completed in 1863 ",
