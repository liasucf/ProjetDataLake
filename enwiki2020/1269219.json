    "text": "Carl Clauberg (28 September 1898 - 9 August 1957) was a German gynecologist who conducted medical experiments on human subjects (mainly Jewish) at Auschwitz concentration camp. He worked with Horst Schumann in X-ray sterilization experiments at Auschwitz concentration camp. == Early life == Dr. Carl Clauberg \u201eThe beast\u201c, Image by the expressionist artist Stefan Krikl from his series Doctors of Death, 1985 Carl Clauberg was born in 1898 in Wupperhof (now part of Leichlingen), Rhine Province, into a family of craftsmen.Carl Clauberg (1898 - 1957) ==Medical career== During the First World War he served as an infantryman. After the war, he studied medicine and eventually reached the rank of chief doctor in the University gynaecological clinic. He joined the Nazi party in 1933 and later was appointed professor of gynaecology at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. He carried out research on female fertility hormones (particularly progesterone) and their application as infertility treatments, obtaining a Habilitation for this work in 1937.Robert Jay Lifton, \"The Nazi doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\", Basic Books, 2000, ; pp. 271\u2013278 of the online edition and references there, http://www.holocaust-history.org/lifton/LiftonT271.shtml He received the rank of SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer of the Reserve.Robert Jay Lifton: \u00c4rzte im Dritten Reich, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1988, S. 312. ==Human experiments at Auschwitz== In 1942 he approached Heinrich Himmler, who knew of him through treatment of a senior SS officer's wife and asked him for an opportunity to perform mass sterilizations on women for his experiments. Himmler agreed, and in December 1942 Clauberg moved to Auschwitz concentration camp. His laboratory was in a part of the Block 10 in the main camp. Clauberg's goal was to find an easy and cheap method to sterilize women. He injected formaldehyde preparations into their uteruses\u2014without anesthetics. His test subjects were Jewish and Romani women who suffered permanent damage and serious infections. Some of the subjects died because of the tests. Estimates of those who were sterilized are around 700. Himmler wanted to know how much time it would take to sterilize 1000 Jewish women in that way. Clauberg's answer was satisfactory: One doctor with 10 assistants should be able to conduct sterilization of a few hundred, or even a few thousand, Jews in one day. ==POW, 1945\u20131955== When the Red Army approached the camp, Clauberg moved to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp to continue his experiments on Romani women. Soviet troops captured him there in 1945. After the war in 1948, Clauberg was put on trial in the Soviet Union and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 1955, he was released (but not pardoned) by the Soviet Union under the Adenauer-Bulganin prisoner exchange agreement, with the final group of about 10,000 POWs and civilian internees., ==Medical career, arrest and death, 1955\u20131957== He returned to West Germany, where he was reinstated at his former clinic based on his prewar scientific output. Bizarre behavior, including openly boasting of his \"achievements\" in \"developing a new sterilization technique at the Auschwitz concentration camp\", destroyed any chance he might have had of staying unnoticed. In 1955, after public outcry from groups of survivors, Clauberg was arrested and put on trial. He died before trial on August 9, 1957 in Kiel Germany. == Clauberg test == The Clauberg test is an obsolete bioassay to assess progestational activity based on the conversion of proliferative endometrium to secretory endometrium in immature rabbits. ==See also== * Block 10 * Josef Mengele ==References== == Bibliography == * Ernst Klee: Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer. 3.
