    "text": "Pelle the Conqueror () is a Danish novel written by Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8. The book was published in four volumes, beginning with Boyhood in 1906, Apprenticeship in 1907, The Great Struggle in 1909 and concluding with Daybreak in 1910. The novel follows the character Pelle Karlsson, who immigrates to Denmark from Sweden in 1877 at age eight. At 18, he moves from Bornholm to Copenhagen, and becomes a leader in the labour movement in Denmark, motivated by poor working conditions. ==Analysis== Nex\u00f8 based the novel on many of the experiences in his own life. While written as a biography of a fictional character, Pelle the Conqueror reports on widespread economic and historic social matters. The format is of a Bildungsroman. The novel was translated into English by Jesse Muir and Bernard Miall in 1913\u20131916. Despite this, it is not a popular novel in the English-speaking world. Pelle the Conqueror has been compared to Les Mis\u00e9rables. ==Adaptations== In 1987, a Danish\u2013Swedish film adaptation directed by Bille August was released. August chose to adapt the novel because it is considered essential reading in Denmark. It starred Pelle Hvenegaard as the young Pelle and Max von Sydow, and won the Palme d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and numerous other awards. In 2017, HBO Nordic and SAM Productions announced they were producing an eight-hour miniseries The Conqueror, written by Rasmus Heisterberg and based on Nex\u00f8's Apprenticeship, The Great Struggle and Daybreak. ==References== Category:1910 Danish novels Category:Bildungsromans Category:Danish-language novels Category:Danish novels Category:Danish novels adapted into films Category:Labor literature ",
