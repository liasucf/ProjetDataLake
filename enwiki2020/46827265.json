    "text": "The 2015\u201316 season was APOEL's 76th season in the Cypriot First Division and 88th year in existence as a football club. ==Season review== ===Head coach changes=== August 2015: On 28 August 2015, APOEL terminated Domingos Paci\u00eancia's contract, following the team's failure to reach the UEFA Champions League group stage after being eliminated by FC Astana in the play-offs of the competition. At the same day, Paci\u00eancia was replaced by Georgian coach Temur Ketsbaia, who signed a two-year contract with the club. April 2016: On 21 April 2016, one day after APOEL's elimination in the Cypriot Cup semi-finals by Apollon Limassol, Temur Ketsbaia's contract with APOEL was mutually terminated, although at that moment the team were four points clear at the top of the league with only four matches remaining. The same day, APOEL's assistant coach Georgios Kostis, took over as caretaker manager for the team's remaining four crucial league games of the season. ===Pre-season and friendlies=== The first training session for the season took place on 18 June 2015 at APOEL's training centre. On 23 June 2015 the team flew to Gniewino in Poland to perform the main stage of their pre-season training and returned to Cyprus on 5 July 2015. During the pre-season training stage in Poland, APOEL played five friendly matches. They won 2\u20130 FK Atlantas, drew 0\u20130 with Lech Pozna\u0144 and lost three times against Lechia Gda\u0144sk (1\u20134), Arka Gdynia (1\u20132) and Lech Pozna\u0144 (0\u20133). After their return to Cyprus, APOEL played one friendly match, beating Doxa Katokopias 4\u20130 at Makario Stadium on 8 July 2015. In between their UEFA Champions League qualifying campaign APOEL played three more friendly matches, beating 2\u20131 Ermis Aradippou, drawing 1\u20131 with Olympiakos Nicosia and winning Greek side Asteras Tripoli 3\u20132. ===Cypriot Super Cup=== APOEL's double success last season meant that Cypriot cup runners-up AEL Limassol would be their super cup opponents. On 12 August 2015, APOEL was defeated 4\u20133 by AEL Limassol in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw at GSP Stadium. It was a match of few chances with both sides unable to muster any clear cut opportunity to get the breakthrough. The Cypriot Super Cup has no extra-time and so the match went straight to the lottery of a penalty shootout. After four accurate spot-kicks, Marios Antoniades shot wide at 2\u20132, while another miss for APOEL through Georgios Efrem turned the odds further into AEL\u2019s favour. An excellent save by Boy Waterman and a successful spot kick from Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti gave APOEL hope but at 3\u20133, AEL's captain Marios Nicolaou tuck away the decisive penalty and hand AEL the first trophy of the campaign. ===Cypriot First Division=== ====Regular season==== On 22 August 2015, APOEL opened their competitive season with an impressive 5\u20131 win at Ammochostos Stadium against Ermis Aradippou. Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti gave APOEL the lead after nine minutes and ten minutes later Lu\u00eds Leal registered his first goal for the club to make it 2\u20130. Semir \u0160tili\u0107 also got his first goal for the club in the 26th minute and Lu\u00eds Leal grabbed his second goal of the game six minutes later. Andreas Vasilogiannis scored Ermis' consolation goal in the 56th minute and Constantinos Charalambides added a fifth goal for APOEL on 63 minutes with a finish from close range. On 30 August 2015, APOEL thrashed Pafos FC 6\u20132 at GSP Stadium in Temur Ketsbaia's debut as APOEL's head coach. Vin\u00edcius broke the deadlock after 33 minutes with a close range header from a Constantinos Charalambides' corner. Jo\u00ebl Damahou leveled the proceedings in the 39th minute after beating Boy Waterman with a powerful strike, but Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti regained APOEL's lead two minutes later. Constantinos Charalambides scored his team's third goal at the hour mark, before Vin\u00edcius score his second from close range after a Nektarios Alexandrou's cross. Fernando Cavenaghi got his debut on 75 minutes and ten minutes later grabbed his first goal for APOEL with an amazing back-heel, before scoring his second goal deep into stoppage time after receiving Vander's pass. Georgian defender Gia Grigalava had scored for Pafos at the other end moments earlier with a sublime free-kick. On 12 September 2015, APOEL dropped their first league points of the season as they drew 2\u20132 away to AEK Larnaca. AEK took the lead late in the first half when Jos\u00e9 Kant\u00e9 headed past APOEL goalkeeper Boy Waterman. AEK's former winger Vander levelled the score in the 68th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the box, but parity lasted only seven minutes as Juanma Ortiz crossed for the unmarked Jorge Monteiro to score at the far post. APOEL's star signing Fernando Cavenaghi equalised with virtually his first touch after coming on as a substitute nine minutes from the end. On 21 September 2015, APOEL claimed a hard-fought 1\u20130 win over Doxa Katokopias at Makario Stadium and moved to the top of the standings, although the three points came at a price after Carl\u00e3o, I\u00f1aki Astiz and Pieros Sotiriou all suffered injuries. APOEL secured the victory in the 13th minute when Fernando Cavenaghi \u2013 who was celebrating his 32nd birthday \u2013 won and converted a penalty, firing beyond Alexandre Negri for his fourth goal in three games. On 26 September 2016, APOEL put their injury problems aside after putting on a dominant performance in a 4\u20130 thrashing of Aris Limassol at GSP Stadium. Fernando Cavenaghi opened the scoring from the penalty spot midway through the first half, while a goal by Georgios Efrem doubled APOEL's advantage before the break. Argentinian Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti wrapped up the scoring with a brace, netting his goals at the beginning and end of the second half. On 5 October 2015, APOEL stayed top of the table alongside AEK Larnaca after breezing to a 5\u20130 win away to Enosis Neon Paralimni. APOEL took the lead on 12 minutes through a Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti free- kick and Vander made it 2\u20130 at the half-hour mark with a shot from outside the area. Georgios Efrem scored the third on 51 minutes, before Fernando Cavenaghi score twice in 62nd and 65th minute. On 17 October 2015, APOEL continued their free-scoring league form under Temur Ketsbaia after thrashing AEL Limassol 6\u20130 at home and remained alone atop league standings. Georgios Efrem scored twice from outside the box in the first fifteen minutes to give his team an early two-goal lead. Fernando Cavenaghi grabbed his first hat-trick in Cyprus, while Kostakis Artymatas scored his first ever goal for APOEL. On 26 October 2015, APOEL stretched their lead at the top of the table to three points after an astonishing 9\u20130 win against Nea Salamina at Ammochostos Stadium. The carnage began early, as in the 2nd minute Georgios Efrem opened the scoring and it was already 4\u20130 by half-time after goals by Semir \u0160tili\u0107, Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti and Dragan \u017darkovi\u0107 (own goal). Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti netted another one early in the second half, while Vin\u00edcius and Pi\u0105tkowski also scored to increase APOEL's lead. Fernando Cavenaghi scored twice in the last ten minutes, snatching a total of twelve goals in seven league matches. On 31 October 2015, APOEL maintained their lead atop the standings with a difficult 3\u20130 victory over Ethnikos Achnas at GSP Stadium. APOEL managed to break the deadlock after 69 minutes, when Constantinos Charalambides received a Fernando Cavenaghi's pass and from close range riffled the ball past Ethnikos' goalkeeper. Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti doubled the advantage six minutes from time, while Vin\u00edcius added a third goal for APOEL in the last minute of the match. On 9 November 2015, APOEL's six-game winning streak came to an end after a thrilling 2\u20132 away draw against rivals Omonia. Omonia got off to the perfect start as Renato Marga\u00e7a took advantage of a lapse in APOEL's defence and slid the ball under the advancing Boy Waterman. APOEL were level in the 15th minute after Fernando Cavenaghi created space for himself outside the box and sidefooted the ball past Omonia keeper. Fernando Cavenaghi gave APOEL the lead in the 51st minute after some great approach play involving Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti and Vander, but Omonia equalized 15 minutes from time when Cillian Sheridan converted a penalty won by Nuno Assis. On 21 November 2015, APOEL suffered their first league defeat of the season, losing 0\u20132 at home to Anorthosis, but remained at the top of the table level on points with AEK Larnaca. In a game of few chances, especially in the opening 45 minutes, Anorthosis took the lead in the 69th minute through Jo\u00e3o Victor and made certain of the three points after Dino Ndlovu converted a late penalty. On 30 November 2015, a Fernando Cavenaghi penalty in the half hour mark was enough for APOEL to clinch all three points against bottom of the table Ayia Napa and move two points clear at the top the table after a difficult 1\u20130 away win. On 5 December 2015, APOEL suffered their consecutive home defeat after losing 0\u20131 to Apollon Limassol and dropped from the first place for the first time in the season. Abraham Gneki Gui\u00e9's goal in the 58th minute was enough to give Apollon the three points and to drop APOEL to the third place of the league table, one point behind the leading duo AEK Larnaca and Anorthosis. On 14 December 2015, APOEL claimed a hard-fought 2\u20130 win over Ermis Aradippou at GSP Stadium and remained one point behind leaders AEK and Anorthosis.

On 19 December 2015, APOEL maintained the pressure on the leading duo after a difficult but deserved 1\u20130 win against Pafos FC at Pafiako Stadium. Vander scored the all-important goal in the 14th minute with a close range header after a Georgios Efrem cross. On 22 December 2015, APOEL fell to their third league defeat of the season after losing 1\u20132 at home to leaders AEK Larnaca and remained to the third place, four points behind AEK. Jo\u00e3o Guilherme gave APOEL a dream start when he scored after only three minutes, but AEK hit back after 31 minutes through David Catal\u00e0. The score remained 1\u20131 until the 72nd minute when Andr\u00e9 Alves hit the winner for AEK after an accurate low cross from Tete. On 3 January 2016, APOEL suffered a second consecutive home defeat after losing 1\u20132 to Doxa Katokopias and dropped to the fourth place, seven points behind leaders AEK Larnaca. Doxa took the lead in the 10th minute through Edmar, while APOEL drew level twenty minutes from the end when substitute Pieros Sotiriou beat Evagoras Hadjifrangiskou from close range. Doxa nicked the three points at the fifth minute of added time when APOEL defender M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio handled in the box and Paulinho thumped the ball past Boy Waterman from the penalty spot. On 10 January 2016, APOEL bounced back from two consecutive league defeats by beating Aris Limassol 2\u20131 at Tsirion Stadium and moved up to the third place, seven points off top spot. Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti scored on incredible solo effort to give APOEL the lead after 31 minutes, netting his tenth league goal of the season. Pieros Sotiriou doubled his team's advantage with a nice header in the 52nd minute, while Aris only managed to pull one goal back twenty minutes before the end with Mathew Boniface. On 17 January 2016, APOEL claimed a convincing 3\u20130 home win over Enosis Neon Paralimni and remained in third place, four points behind leaders AEK Larnaca. Nuno Morais broke the deadlock after 41 minutes when he tried to cross the ball toward the center of the box and tricked Enosis goalkeeper and four minutes later Fernando Cavenaghi scored from the penalty spot to double APOEL's lead. Giannis Gianniotas added a third one with a powerful shot from outside the area in the 63rd minute, to score his first goal for APOEL. On 24 January 2016, APOEL continued their surge back to the top with a convincing 1\u20130 win over AEL Limassol at Tsirion Stadium and closed the gap on league leaders AEK Larnaca to two points. The only goal of the game came early in the second half from Portuguese captain Nuno Morais who beat Mat\u00edas Degra from just inside the area with a fierce drive. On 30 January 2016, APOEL continued their surge to the top with an impressive 6\u20131 home win against Nea Salamina and moved up to the second place, two points behind AEK Larnaca. The teams were level at half time after an early opener by Pieros Sotiriou and a penalty by Dimitar Makriev in the 14th minute. In the second half APOEL poured forward, proving too strong for Nea Salamina. Argentinian Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti started and finished the second-half rout with Vander, Vin\u00edcius and Fernando Cavenaghi scoring in between. On 7 February 2016, APOEL beat Ethnikos Achna 3\u20131 at Dasaki Stadium and returned to top of the table, one point ahead of AEK Larnaca who lost 3\u20131 to Omonia. Pieros Sotiriou opened the scoring in the 17th minute, heading home from close range and three minutes before the break he doubled his side's lead, after taking the ball past Martin Bogatinov to finish into an empty net. Fernando Cavenaghi added a third from the penalty spot on 67 minute, while Marios Elia managed just to put Ethnikos on the scoresheet with a fine goal in the 90th minute. On 13 February 2016, APOEL easily beat arch-rivals Omonia 2\u20130 and remained atop league standings, one point ahead of AEK Larnaca. Former Omonia skipper Georgios Efrem haunted his old club after scoring twice in the first half. In the 9th minute, Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti's cross from the right wing met by the Cypriot winger who finished well with his left inside the six-yard-box. Three minutes before the break Efrem grabbed his second, firing past the helpless Constantinos Panagi after receiving Giannis Gianniotas' low cross from the right side of the area. On 21 February 2016, APOEL beat Anorthosis 2\u20131 at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in the big match of the weekend to maintain their one-point lead over AEK Larnaca at the top of the table. Two first-half goals by Pieros Sotiriou and Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti were enough to give APOEL the three points. Despite reducing the deficit early in the second half through Dino Ndlovu, Anorthosis did little else with APOEL always looking the more likely team to score. On 27 February 2016, APOEL had few problems against Ayia Napa as they defeated the already relegated team 3\u20130 at home. Georgios Efrem opened the score early in the game, with Vander and Efstathios Aloneftis completing the score. On 2 March 2016, APOEL won Apollon Limassol 1\u20130 at Tsirion Stadium and ended the regular season atop the league standings, one point ahead of AEK Larnaca. Georgios Efrem scored the winning goal just six minutes into the match, while Apollon missed a great chance to equalize five minutes later, when Alex da Silva's penalty hit the bar. ====Play-offs==== On 5 March 2016, in the opening round of the championship play-offs, APOEL managed a narrow 1\u20130 win away to Nea Salamina thanks to Carl\u00e3o's strike late in the first half and opened up a three-point lead at the top, following AEK Larnaca's 2\u20132 draw with Apollon Limassol. On 12 March 2016, APOEL came from behind to beat arch-rivals Omonia 2\u20131 at GSP Stadium and preserved their three-point lead at the top of the table. Against the run of play, Omonia took the lead in 35th minute when a mix up in the APOEL defence allowed Beb\u00ea to weave past a couple of players and curl the ball past Urko Pardo. The lead lasted just seven minutes as APOEL piled on the pressure and were rewarded when Georgios Efrem blasted the ball past keeper from inside the box after receiving Zhivko Milanov's low cross from the right. The winner came just six minutes from time from Brazilian winger Vander who rolled the ball into an empty net after taking the rebound of Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti's shoot which rattled the woodwork. On 20 March 2016, APOEL took a huge step towards their fourth consecutive league title after crushing challengers AEK Larnaca 3\u20130 at GSZ Stadium and opened up a six-point gap at the top of the table. It took APOEL just eight minutes to breach AEK's defense as Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti raced clear and beat the advancing To\u00f1o with a clever chip. Six minutes before the break, Georgios Efrem received the ball on the edge of the penalty box and curled the ball into the top-left corner for a memorable goal. AEK had a chance of getting back into the game in the 50th minute after referee awarded them a controversial penalty, but APOEL's keeper Urko Pardo managed to block Andr\u00e9 Alves shot from the spot. While AEK had no answers to APOEL's relentless pressure and quick attacks, Pieros Sotiriou provided the icing on the cake in the 74th minute when he beat the keeper from close range. On 2 April 2016, APOEL's twelve-game winning streak came to an end after a 2\u20132 home draw against Apollon Limassol and AEK Larnaca took advantage to move to within four points of the top of the table. Apollon took the lead after 22 minutes through Anton Maglica, but the advantage lasted just two of minutes as Carl\u00e3o headed past keeper Bruno Vale after a Georgios Efrem cross. Alex da Silva put Apollon back in the lead before the break with a well-taken free-kick, but APOEL were fortunate to salvage a point thanks to a last-minute equaliser by former Apollon captain, Giorgos Merkis. On 9 April 2016, APOEL dropped points for the second straight match after a 1\u20131 away draw against Anorthosis and allowed second placed AEK Larnaca to move to within two points of the top. Constantinos Laifis beat APOEL keeper Urko Pardo from 20 metres out to give Anorthosis the lead in the 70th minute, but APOEL managed to equalize two minutes from time thanks to a well-taken free-kick by Giannis Gianniotas. On 16 April 2016, APOEL moved a step closer to their third consecutive championship title as they increased their lead at the top to four points, following their 4\u20131 home win against Nea Salamina and AEK Larnaca's 2\u20132 draw against Apollon Limassol. APOEL had few problems in defeating Nea Salamina with Semir \u0160tili\u0107, Pieros Sotiriou, Nuno Morais and Constantinos Charalambides getting on the scoresheet, with ex-APOEL player Aldo Adorno getting Salamina's consolation goal. On 23 April 2016, under caretaker coach Giorgos Kostis, APOEL beat arch-rivals Omonia 2\u20130 at GSP Stadium and moved a step closer to their fourth consecutive league title, as they maintained their four points advantage from AEK Larnaca, only three matches before the end. Greek winger Giannis Gianniotas was the hero for APOEL who scored both goals, after taking advantage of poor Omonia defending. The first goal came midway through the first half when he headed past Omonia keeper after Nektarios Alexandrou's cross from the left. A minute before the break, Pieros Sotiriou stole the ball from Omonia's defenders and passed to Gianniotas who slotted the ball past the oncoming goalkeeper from inside the area. On 28 April 2016, APOEL claimed their fourth consecutive league title after overcoming second placed AEK Larnaca 2\u20130 at a packed GSP Stadium. APOEL, which a few days ago parted ways with coach Temur Ketsbaia, had headed into the game four points ahead of AEK with caretaker manager Giorgos Kostis on charge. Andr\u00e9 Alves had missed the game's first big chance before a mistake by AEK defender led to a quick counter-attack involving Giannis Gianniotas and Vander and finished off by Pieros Sotiriou who had rounded the goalkeeper before scoring into an empty net just before halftime. Twenty minutes after the break APOEL made it 2\u20130, when Giannis Gianniotas was fouled in the area and the Greek winger picked himself up to score the penalty to secure APOEL's 25th Cypriot First Division title. On 7 May 2016, champions APOEL decided to rest many first-team players and saw their 17-match unbeaten run ended after suffering a 1\u20130 loss at Apollon Limassol thanks to a Luka Stojanovi\u0107 strike at the half-hour mark. On 15 May 2016, APOEL drew 2\u20132 at home against Anorthosis to break the club's best league scoring record with 91 goals and collect 83 points, the most points ever collected in a single season. Pieros Sotiriou put the champions ahead in the 12th minute but Efthimis Koulouris levelled just before the break. APOEL took the lead again through Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti amazing free-kick with 56 minutes on the clock, but seven minutes later Anorthosis equalized via Andreas Makris. After the end of the match, celebrations followed as the APOEL's captain Constantinos Charalambides lifted the Cypriot First Division trophy in front of jubilant APOEL fans in the packed GSP Stadium. ===Cypriot Cup=== ====Second round==== APOEL won the Cypriot cup last season and as such entered the second round of this season competition. APOEL were drawn to face Cypriot First Division side Nea Salamina. On 13 January 2016, APOEL secured a narrow 1\u20130 advantage over Nea Salamina at Ammochostos Stadium, thanks to a long-range goal from Nuno Morais goal just after the hour mark. On 27 January 2016, APOEL secured their place in Cypriot cup quarter-finals after beating again Nea Salamina 3\u20132 at Nicosia, to seal a 4\u20132 aggregate victory. APOEL got off to a flying start, as Argentine striker Fernando Cavenaghi opened the scoring after just nine minutes and Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti doubled his team's advantage in the 36th minute. Early into the second-half Vin\u00edcius added his name on to the scoresheet to make it 3\u20130 (4\u20130 on aggregate), ending any faint hopes of a remarkable Nea Salamina comeback. The visitors managed to register a goal through Ivan \u0106urjuri\u0107 who converted a penalty in the 74th minute, and two minutes later they added a second via a thumping Liliu header. ====Quarter-finals==== In the Cypriot cup quarter-finals, APOEL were drawn to face Cypriot First Division side Aris Limassol. In the first leg of their Cypriot Cup quarter-finals clash on 10 February 2016, APOEL were held to a 1\u20131 draw by Aris Limassol at GSP Stadium. Randy opened the scoring for the visitors in the 15th minute, but their joy was short-lived as APOEL hit back just three minutes later through a Fernando Cavenaghi penalty, leaving the tie evenly balanced. On 17 February 2016, APOEL made it through to the semi-finals of the Cypriot Cup after a 3\u20131 win over Aris Limassol at Tsirion Stadium. Georgios Efrem broke the deadlock four minutes after the restart, but Markos Maragoudakis equalized for Aris just after the hour mark. Thirteen minutes before the end Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti gave again APOEL the lead and Efstathios Aloneftis four minutes later kept Temur Ketsbaia's side on track for yet another domestic double. ====Semi-finals==== In the Cypriot cup semi-finals, APOEL were drawn to face Apollon Limassol. On 6 April 2016, in the first leg of their semi-final clash, APOEL were held to a 1\u20131 draw in Nicosia by Apollon Limassol. Apollon took the lead through Abraham Gneki Gui\u00e9 in the 21st minute after Giorgos Merkis' mistake and Pieros Sotiriou equalized just eight minutes later, with nobody unable to break the deadlock in the second half. On 20 April 2016, APOEL were defeated by Apollon Limassol 5\u20134 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw at Tsirion Stadium and eliminated from the Cypriot Cup final, missing a great chance to defend their title for a third consecutive season. Alex Da Silva gave Apollon the lead with a direct free-kick after 45 minutes, but the lead was short-lived, with Georgios Efrem equalizing two minutes later, just a few seconds before the end of the first half. Despite of Vin\u00edcius was sent off after only five minutes of extra time and APOEL played with ten players for 25 minutes, there were no more goals until the end of the 120 minutes and the match went to penalties. Both sides scored all their first four penalties, before APOEL's defender I\u00f1aki Astiz saw his effort saved by Apollon keeper Bruno Vale and Dejan Mezga made no mistake sending the ball past Urko Pardo to send Apollon to the final. On 21 April 2016, one day after APOEL's elimination in the Cypriot Cup semi-finals, coach Temur Ketsbaia's contract with APOEL was mutually terminated. ===UEFA Champions League=== ====Second qualifying round==== APOEL won the Cypriot league last season and as such entered the second qualifying round of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League. APOEL were drawn to start their campaign against FK Vardar. On 14 July 2015, APOEL endured a frustrating opening Champions League campaign after being held to a 0\u20130 home draw by FK Vardar in the first leg of the second qualifying round. Domingos Paci\u00eancia\u2019s side had squandered numerous chances in the game particularly after 40th minute, following a cagey opening to the game. FK Vardar rarely threatened Boy Waterman\u2019s goal while their own keeper Tome Pa\u010dovski was called into action on numerous occasions to foil Lu\u00eds Leal, Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti and Georgios Efrem. On 21 July 2015, APOEL survived an early scare in their Champions League qualifying campaign, scraping through the second qualifying round on the away goals rule with a nervous 1\u20131 draw at Skopje over FK Vardar. Except some problems in finding the final touch, APOEL were always the superior team against Vardar and Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti's goal on 60 minutes was enough to see them through the third qualifying round, despite Blagoj\u010de Ljam\u010devski's late equalizer. ====Third qualifying round==== APOEL were drawn to face Danish champions FC Midtjylland in the third qualifying round of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League. On 28 July 2015, APOEL took big a step towards UEFA Champions League play-offs after an important 2\u20131 win against FC Midtjylland at MCH Arena. Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti was once again the hero as he scored one and forced an own goal from Kian Hansen in a brilliant first half for the Cypriot champions, while new signing Lu\u00eds Leal missed a glorious chance to make the score 3\u20130 before Jakob Poulsen score a late goal for Midtjylland. On 4 August 2015, ten-men APOEL squeezed into the Champions League play-offs after prevailing against FC Midtjylland on the away goals rule, despite a shock 0\u20131 home defeat. APOEL got off to the worst possible start when Jakob Poulsen's resulting free-kick floated over the defence and met the head of Erik Sviatchenko who steered the ball past Boy Waterman. Then came more despair for APOEL when the referee handed the Brazilian midfielder Vin\u00edcius a straight red card for a strong challenge on Pione Sisto. The second half was a cagey affair with APOEL reluctant leak another goal, while Midtjylland players launched countless ineffective long balls into Boy Waterman's area. Albeit under extremely difficult circumstances, APOEL secured European group stage football for the fifth time in seven seasons and a place in the UEFA Champions League play-offs draw. ====Play-off round==== APOEL were drawn to face Kazakh champions FC Astana in the play-off round of the Champions League, as they attempt to reach the group stages for the fourth time in their history. On 18 August 2015, APOEL fell to a 1\u20130 defeat against FC Astana at Astana Arena in their Champions League play-off first leg match, leaving themselves with plenty of work to do in the return match in Nicosia. Domingos Paci\u00eancia's side were punished for a piece of poor defending on 14 minutes to allow Bauyrzhan Dzholchiev to score the game\u2019s only goal, while APOEL once again failed to score, despite creating chances for a crucial away goal. On 26 August 2015, APOEL were very close to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage, before a late Astana goal saw their hopes evaporate after a 1\u20131 draw at GSP Stadium. Trailing 1\u20130 from the first leg in Kazakhstan, APOEL had dominated possession in the second leg in Nicosia but failed to take their chances against seemingly weaker opposition. On the hour mark, Semir \u0160tili\u0107 whipped in a wonderful free-kick beyond the reach of the Astana keeper to bring APOEL level in the tie, but a late equaliser from Nemanja Maksimovi\u0107 sent APOEL crashing out of the UEFA Champions League. APOEL\u2019s hopes of a fourth Champions League group stage campaign came to an end, but their European season continued in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League. Also, following the team's failure to reach the UEFA Champions League group stage, Domingos Paci\u00eancia was fired two days later and he was replaced by Georgian coach Temur Ketsbaia, who signed a two-year contract with the club. ===UEFA Europa League=== ====Group stage==== After being eliminated by FC Astana in the play-off round of the Champions League, APOEL were automatically transferred to the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, drawn in Group K alongside Schalke 04, Sparta Prague and Asteras Tripolis. On 17 September 2015, APOEL's Europa League campaign got off to bad start as they suffered a 3\u20130 defeat by Schalke 04 at GSP Stadium in Nicosia. Schalke had the game wrapped up inside the opening half-an-hour after goals from Jo\u00ebl Matip and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, while Max Meyer and Johannes Geis had also rattled the crossbar early on. APOEL's hopes for a positive result ended after Huntelaar's second goal in the 71st minute, while Tom\u00e1s De Vincenti was sent off for the hosts 13 minutes before the end for swearing at the referee. On 1 October 2015, APOEL fell to a second straight defeat in the Europa League, going down to a 2\u20130 loss to Sparta Prague at Generali Arena, making the club's aspirations of reaching the next round complicated. APOEL's already tough challenge was made even more difficult due to the absence of six first team players who were suffering injuries. On 23 minutes, a chipped ball to the angle of the penalty area found David Lafata who picked out an unmarked Kehinde Fatai to tap the ball in from a few yards out. Just moments after APOEL came very close to a leveller with Georgios Efrem close range effort, Sparta sprung forward in numbers and a far post cross found Jakub Brabec who made no mistake with the finish, putting his team in front by two goals on the hour mark. On 22 October 2015, APOEL came from behind to end an eight-match wait for a home win and earned their first points in Group K after beating Asteras Tripoli 2\u20131 at GSP Stadium. After just eight minutes, Argentinian Facundo Bertoglio crossed from the left to his countryman Braian Lluy who calmly placed the ball beyond Boy Waterman to hand Asteras a shock early lead. On 16 minutes, the game was suspended because of floodlight failure, leading to a delay of 12 minutes. The breakthrough for APOEL came in the eighth minute of first-half stoppage time thanks to a Fernando Cavenaghi goal from the penalty spot. In the second half, APOEL kept pushing on for another goal and the winner came in the 59th minute when Carl\u00e3o headed the ball into the net after Semir \u0160tili\u0107's corner. The visitors failed to threaten late on and APOEL comfortably closed out the game to seal a crucial three points which put them back in contention to qualify for the knockout phase. On 5 November 2015, APOEL's chances of making the knockout phase of the Europa League were dealt a huge blow as they suffered a 2\u20130 defeat at the hands of Asteras Tripoli at Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium. APOEL got off to a nightmare start as a poor clearance from Marios Antoniades fell to Facundo Bertoglio who smashed the ball into the roof of the net to make it 1\u20130 after only two minutes. From that point on, APOEL began to dominate proceedings and were almost level when Semir \u0160tili\u0107's strike hit the post, but Asteras dealt a killer blow to their chances as they doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time after a close header by Apostolos Giannou. APOEL had been looking for a spark during the second half but it simply would not come as they slumped to their third defeat and sitting bottom of the group with just three points. On 26 November 2015, a late Schalke 04 winner at Veltins-Arena was enough to knock APOEL out of UEFA Europa League and to send the German side to the next round. Despite of Schalke's first half dominance, the biggest chances of the night fell to APOEL midway through the second half when Nuno Morais and Vander failed to beat Schalke's goalkeeper Ralf F\u00e4hrmann from close range. But just when it looked like APOEL had earned a commendable draw, Schalke grabbed a winner with just four minutes remaining after Sascha Riether's low cross found Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in the box and the forward found the net to make it 1\u20130. Two minutes later, Schalke awarded a penalty but Boy Waterman stooped low to save Dennis Aogo's kick. On 10 December 2015, APOEL suffered a 1\u20133 defeat against Sparta Prague at GSP Stadium and ended a miserable Europa League campaign bottom of Group K with only three points, after one win and five defeats in six games. Fernando Cavenaghi scored a fantastic drive after only six minutes to give APOEL an early lead, but Sparta Prague managed to equalize on the hour mark thank to a lucky deflected goal by Luk\u00e1\u0161 Juli\u0161. Experienced striker David Lafata came off the bench on 74 minutes and just three minutes later grabbed the goal that would give his side the lead. Three minutes before the end Lafata scored again to make it 1\u20133 with a neat finish. The result, in the end, was of little meaning for either side as victory for Schalke 04 over Asteras Tripolis in the group's other game meant the Germans claimed top spot with Sparta finishing second, while APOEL finished bottom. ==Current squad== Last Update: 2 April 2016 For recent transfers, see List of Cypriot football transfers summer 2015.
