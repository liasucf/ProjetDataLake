Riisvangen Stadion was constructed in the 1936 on the initiative of Aarhus Municipality. During this period, the population of Aarhus had experienced a large population growth concentrated around northern Aarhus, known as Aarhus N, and the construction of a sports facility would facilitate needs to nurture sports in the area.
