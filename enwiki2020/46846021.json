    "text": "Andrei or Andreya Shadrin () was a Cossack leader who founded a fortress at Endirey in the late 16th century.. It was named Andreyevo or Andreyaul in his honor until 1991. This story may be a folk tale. Baddeley,@kindle720 citing no source, says that in 1579 Yermak, \u201cAndreya Shadrin\u201d and another outlaw took counsel at the mouth of the Volga. Yermak went north, Andreya went south and fortified \u201cTerkee\u2019\u2019 and later settled at the present Enderey. He identifies Terkee with a previous \u201cTioumen\u201d on the lower Terek. [Tyumen (:ru:\u0422\u044e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c (\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437)) was destroyed by flood and replaced by Terkee or Tersky Gorod. Yermak started for Siberia some time between 1579 and 1582.] Barrett Thomas M. Barrett, At the Edge of Empire: The Terek Cossacks and the North Caucasus Frontier 1700-1860, 1999, pages 13-16 uses \u201cAndrei\u201d with no last name. He says the story was first recorded by captain Johann-Gustav Gerber in his 1728 description of Endirey. P.L Iudin, writing in 1914, could find no documentation for Andrei. Barrett says the Yermak-Andrei link was recorded in 1856 but does not pursue the matter. He mentions other stories about an Andrei who led various groups or founded various places in the North Caucasus. ==References== Category:Russian Cossacks Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Place of birth missing ",
