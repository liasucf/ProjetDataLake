In 1768 she married a Polish noble, General Jan Jerzy Grabowski (died 1789). Some of the children of this marriage are thought to have actually been children of the last Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth king, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski. In 1789, she became a widow and possibly entered into a secret, morganatic marriage with the King,http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/64004,,,,grabowska_elzbieta,haslo.html remaining known at court as his ma\u00eetresse-en-titre. However, Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary who knew her, reported that tales of this marriage only circulated after Poniatowski's death, and were spread about by El\u017cbieta herself, but were not generally believed. She was thought to have exercised some influence on the king during his reign perceived as negative, which made her unpopular. In 1795, King Stanis\u0142aw abdicated following the Third Partition of Poland, and lived in Grodno under Russian watch until, in 1796, Paul I of Russia invited him to Saint Petersburg. El\u017cbieta, with her two sons, Stanis\u0142aw and Micha\u0142, took the king to Saint Petersburg to care for him there, and she lived with him until his sudden death in 1798. Afterwards, she returned to Warsaw, then under Prussian rule following the Partitions, where she became a patroness of the Tableau vivant there. She died in Warsaw on 1 June 1810, survived by four of her children. She had three sons and two daughters with the king, and their second son, Micha\u0142 Grabowski, distinguished himself in combat, eventually becoming a general in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw. == Issue == Her children were: * Stanis\u0142aw * Micha\u0142 * Casimir * Aleksandra (13 April 1771 \u2013 12 May 1789), who married Franciszek Salezy Krasicki in 1787 * Izabela Grabowska (1776\u20131858), who married Walenty Faustyn Sobolewski in 1795 * Constance == References == * H.
