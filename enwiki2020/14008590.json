His father is said to have brought his family to live in Albany in 1772 from Massachusetts. ==Career== In the New York City directories of 1792 and 1793, he was listed as a \"house carpenter\" where he likely learned architecture from European architects and engineers who were working in the City. Hooker assembled a library during this period and when his parents and the rest of his family moved to Utica in 1797, he stayed behind in Albany. He became a prominent member of Albany serving as alderman assessor, city architect, city superintendent, and city surveyor. During his career, he designed Hyde Hall, the facade of the Hamilton College Chapel, The Albany Academy, Albany City Hall, and the original New York State Capitol building. He is believed to have designed the Gen. John G. Weaver House at Utica, New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ===Notable buildings=== An existing National Register of Historic Places building that he designed, with John H. Lothrop, is: *Hamilton College Chapel on the Hamilton College campus. Two other National Register of Historic Places that are also National Historic Landmarks which he designed are: *Hyde Hall, at Otsego Lake *Roscoe Conkling House, in Utica, New York Others: * New York State Arsenal (1799; razed) * St. Peter's Episcopal Church (1802; razed 1859) * New York State Bank (1803; portions of front elevation survive) * Bank of Albany (1809; rzed) * Mechanics and Farmers Bank (1811; portions reused in receiving vault, Glenmont) * Aiken House, Rensselaer, New York (1816) * St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (1829; razed) * Albany City Hall (1832, destroyed by fire in 1880) ===Private residences=== He also designed many private residences for wealthy Albanians including the Van Rensselaers, Cornings, Pruyns, Lansings, William James and others. One mansion attributed to him and built for Samuel Hill, is now the Fort Orange Club at 110 Washington Avenue.
