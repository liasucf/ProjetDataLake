Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. ==Production== The design was built by Aloha Yachts, a brand of Ouyang Boat Works, in Canada from 1979 to 1988, but it is now out of production. ==Design== The Aloha 32 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wooden trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a raised transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.

The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 171. ==Operational history== A review by Richard Sherwood described the design, \"the Aloha is light and should accelerate well. It is primarily a cruiser. In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"Mark Ellis appears to have successfully squeezed in everything from the Niagara 35 into this 32 footer - everything is just a little tighter. Aside from 3 feet in the overall length, the main difference between the two boats is that one was manufactured by Hinterhoeller, and the other by Aloha (two builders who had good reputations).\" ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Bayfield 30/32 *Beneteau 323 *C&C; 32 *Columbia 32 *Douglas 32 *Hunter 32 Vision *Hunter 326 *Mirage 32 *Nonsuch 324 *Ontario 32 *Ranger 32 *Watkins 32 ==References== Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ",
