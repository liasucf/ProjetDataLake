    "text": "Envoy Air Inc. (formerly American Eagle Airlines) is an American regional airline headquartered in Irving, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group that, along with several carriers outside the group, feeds the American Airlines route network under the American Eagle brand. With over 1000 flights a day, serving 150 cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, Envoy is considered to be one of the world's largest regional airline systems. Envoy is an affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance. The company slogan is Going for great. The name \"American Eagle Airlines\" was also used between April 1980 and April 1981 by an unrelated air charter service that suspended operations and filed bankruptcy before flying any scheduled operations. == History == Saab 340BPlus formerly operated by American Eagle at Los Angeles International Airport. (2007) Envoy began as a collection of regional carriers with contracts to carry the American Eagle brand name. The first American Eagle flight was operated by Metroflight Airlines, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Metro Airlines (formerly Houston Metro Airlines), on November 1, 1984, from Fayetteville, Arkansas and Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Metroflight utilized Convair 580 turboprop aircraft that had been formerly operated by Frontier Airlines. Other carriers that have flown in American Eagle livery include Executive Airlines, Command Airways, Air Virginia, Simmons Airlines, Chaparral Airlines and Wings West Airlines. Among other aircraft in its fleet, Chaparral flew Grumman I-C turboprops which were stretched, 37 passenger regional airliner versions of Grumman's successful propjet business aircraft and was one of only a few air carriers to ever operate the type in scheduled passenger service. Until 1987 these third-party carriers flew under contract with American Airlines to provide regional feed to its hubs. During 1987 and 1988 AMR Corp. acquired its regional carriers, starting with Simmons Airlines. AMR's final airline d/b/a American Eagle acquisition was Executive Airlines in 1989. By mid-1991 AMR had consolidated the number of carriers to four. The May 15, 1998, merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons (and the name change of Simmons Airlines to American Eagle Airlines) reduced the number of carriers flying as American Eagle under separate operating certificates to two: American Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. During 2007, AMR began studying ways to spin American Eagle Airlines off into a separate company, including, but not limited to, the possibilities of selling the company to either stockholders or to an unaffiliated third party. In 2008, AMR said any plans had been put on hold until the airline industry stabilized after the worldwide financial crisis. In July 2011, AMR announced the spin-off of American Eagle Airlines but those plans were again put on hold when Parent AMR Corp. filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In 2014 the company changed its name to Envoy Air Inc., but American Eagle continues to live on as a brand, as well as livery for Envoy-operated and third party-operated regional flights. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\" |+ American Eagle carriers |- !Carrier !Eagle service began !Acquired by AMR !Eagle service ended !Notes |- |Metroflight Airlines (formerly Metro Airlines) | |May 28, 1993 |May 28, 1993 |Bankrupt; assets acquired by Simmons Airlines |- |AVAir (formerly Air Virginia) |May 15, 1985 |May 1988 |May 1988 |Bankrupt; assets acquired by Nashville Eagle |- |Simmons Airlines |October 1, 1985 |August 1, 1987 |May 15, 1998 |Merged with Flagship and Wings West to form American Eagle Airlines |- |Command Airways |April 27, 1986 | |June 1, 1991 |Merged into Nashville Eagle to form Flagship Airlines |- |Wings West |June 1986 |August 9, 1987 |May 15, 1998 |Merged into Simmons to form American Eagle Airlines, Inc. |- |Executive Airlines |November 1, 1986 |1990 | |San Juan (SJU) American Eagle hub shut down with ATR-72 turboprop aircraft phased out of fleet |- |Nashville Eagle |January 1988 |January 1988 |June 1, 1991 |Merged with Command Airways to form Flagship Airlines |- |Flagship Airlines |June 1, 1991 |June 1, 1991 |May 15, 1998 |Formed by the merger of Command Airways into Nashville Eagle; merged into Simmons to form American Eagle Airlines, Inc. |- |American Eagle Airlines |May 15, 1998 |May 15, 1998 |Apr 15, 2014 |Formed by the merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons |- |Envoy Air |Apr 15, 2014 |May 15, 1998 |Still Operating |American Eagle Airlines rebranded to Envoy |} * In January 1988, Nashville Eagle became AMR Corp.\u2019s first and only start-up airline, using equipment acquired from Air Midwest. * American Eagle Airlines launched its regional jet service in May 1998 using Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft. * Business Express was acquired by AMR Eagle Holdings Corporation in March 1999,\"Company News: American Eagle Air buying Business Express.\" The New York Times.

Aircraft operated by American Eagle continued to operate under the current American Eagle branding, but an \"Operated by Envoy Air\" label was added, similar to the label used by other contract airlines that fly aircraft with American Eagle livery.Envoy is picked as new name for American Eagle Airlines | Dallas News - Business . The Dallas Morning News. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. This name change was created to avoid confusion when American Airlines announced that other regional carriers would operate on behalf of American. The term 'Envoy' is a reincarnation of the now deprecated Envoy Class of seating on US Airways aircraft. == Corporate affairs == The headquarters for Envoy Air located at 4301 Regent Blvd. in Irving, TX.

Until April 11, 2012, the carrier also had a codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines on California routes. == Destinations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |+ MQ hubs listed by departures (January 15, 2020) !
