    "text": "\"Always Have Always Will\" is a single by Swedish pop band Ace of Base. Heavily inspired by the Motown sound of the mid-1960s, the intro samples the intros from the Supremes track \"Where Did Our Love Go\" and the Four Tops track \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\". It was co-written by Jonas Berggren with Mike Chapman. The song was originally titled \"Killer on the Rampage\" and contained different lyrics. When the song was pitched as a potential song for the upcoming Flowers/Cruel Summer album, Arista records liked the melody; however, requested that the lyrics be rewritten. The song was released from the album Flowers in many parts of the world, but at different times. *UK on 7 December 1998 as single three, following \"Life Is a Flower\" and \"Cruel Summer\". *Australia in early 1999 as the second single, following \"Cruel Summer\" *Scandinavia & Germany on 1 March 1999 as single four, following \"Life Is a Flower\", \"Cruel Summer\", and \"Travel to Romantis\". ==Critical reception== Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet wrote that the song \"ties ecstatic summery serpentines between classic girl-pop and glittery seventies disco\".\"ACE OF BASE Flowers\".
