    "text": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 or TGF-\u03b21 is a polypeptide member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of cytokines. It is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. In humans, TGF-\u03b21 is encoded by the TGFB1 gene. == Function == TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional set of peptides that controls proliferation, differentiation, and other functions in many cell types. TGF-\u03b2 acts synergistically with TGFA in inducing transformation. It also acts as a negative autocrine growth factor. Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 activation and signaling may result in apoptosis. Many cells synthesize TGF-\u03b2 and almost all of them have specific receptors for this peptide. TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23 all function through the same receptor signaling systems. TGF-\u03b21 was first identified in human platelets as a protein with a molecular mass of 25 kilodaltons with a potential role in wound healing. It was later characterized as a large protein precursor (containing 390 amino acids) that was proteolytically processed to produce a mature peptide of 112 amino acids. TGF-\u03b21 plays an important role in controlling the immune system, and shows different activities on different types of cell, or cells at different developmental stages. Most immune cells (or leukocytes) secrete TGF-\u03b21. === T cells=== Some T cells (e.g. regulatory T cells) release TGF-\u03b21 to inhibit the actions of other T cells. Interleukin 1- and interleukin 2-dependent proliferation of activated T cells, and the activation of quiescent helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells is prevented by the activity of TGF-\u03b21. Similarly, TGF-\u03b21 can inhibit the secretion and activity of many other cytokines including interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and various interleukins. It can also decrease the expression levels of cytokine receptors, such as the IL-2 receptor to down-regulate the activity of immune cells. However, TGF-\u03b21 can also increase the expression of certain cytokines in T cells and promote their proliferation, particularly if the cells are immature. === B cells === TGF-\u03b21 has similar effects on B cells that also vary according to the differentiation state of the cell. It inhibits proliferation and stimulates apoptosis of B cells, and plays a role in controlling the expression of antibody, transferrin and MHC class II proteins on immature and mature B cells. === Myeloid cells === The effects of TGF-\u03b21 on macrophages and monocytes is predominantly suppressive; this cytokine can inhibit the proliferation of these cells and prevent their production of reactive oxygen (e.g. superoxide (O2\u2212)) and nitrogen (e.g. nitric oxide (NO)) intermediates. However, as with other cell types, TGF-\u03b21 can also have the opposite effect on cells of myeloid origin. For example, TGF-\u03b21 acts as a chemoattractant, directing an immune response to some pathogens; macrophages and monocytes respond to low levels of TGF-\u03b21 in a chemotactic manner. Furthermore, the expression of monocytic cytokines (including interleukin-1(IL-1)-alpha, IL-1-beta, and TNF-\u03b1), and phagocytic killing by macrophages can be increased by the action of TGF-\u03b21. TGF-\u03b21 reduces the efficacy of the MHC II in astrocytes and dendritic cells, which in turn decreases the activation of appropriate helper T cell populations. == Interactions == TGF beta 1 has been shown to interact with: * Decorin, * EIF3I * LTBP1, * TGF beta receptor 1, and * YWHAE. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Proteins Category:TGF\u03b2 domain ",
