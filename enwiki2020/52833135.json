    "text": "Notes on Blindness is a 2016 British documentary film directed by Peter Middleton and James Spinney. The film profiles writer and theologian John M. Hull, who became totally blind after decades of steadily deteriorating vision. To help him make sense of the upheaval in his life, Hull began documenting his experiences on audio cassette and wrote his autobiography Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness in 1990. The film won the British Independent Film Award for Best Documentary and received nominations for Best Director, Breakthrough Producer, Best Achievement in Craft (Joakim Sundstr\u00f6m for sound) and the Douglas Hickox Award. At the 70th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for Best British Film, Best Documentary and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. It was pitched at Sheffield Doc/Fest's 2012 MeetMarket. Dan Renton Skinner and Simone Kirby depict John Hull and Marilyn Hull respectively in the film. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2016 films Category:British films Category:English- language films Category:2016 documentary films Category:British documentary films Category:Documentary films about blind people ",
