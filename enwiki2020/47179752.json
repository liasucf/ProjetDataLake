On 20 September 1576 he wrote a long letter in his favour to Burghley,Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland, of the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, Volume 2, 1574-85, p. 99 and in November 1576 vainly asked the privy council to appoint Molyneux, along with another, supervisor of the attorneys, who had 'grown very crafty and corrupt'.Arthur Collins, Letters and Memorials of State in the Reigns of Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, i. 145, 187-8, 194 In September 1578 Molyneux was sent by Sidney to London to report upon the state of Ireland.Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland, of the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, Volume 2, 1574-85, p. 142 On 31 December 1579 he petitioned the privy council for his 'despatch and payment after long suit'.Calendar of the State Papers relating to Ireland, of the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, Volume 2, 1574-85, p. 203 Molyneux furnished an account of Sir Henry, Sir Philip, Sir Robert, and Thomas Sidney to Holinshed's Chronicles (ed. 1587, iii. 1548-56), in which he complained that Sir Henry Sidney, however he might strive, never succeeded in obtaining for him a comfortable office or reward of any kind.
