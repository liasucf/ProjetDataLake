    "text": "The Premier Reserve League (officially known as The Barclays Premier Reserve League for sponsorship reasons) was the reserve team league for the top English football teams in the Premier League. The league was split into a northern and a southern division. The league started out in 1999, replacing The Central League in the north and The Football Combination in the south as the top level of reserve-team football, although those competitions continued for lower-level teams and from 2004 to 2005, the regional champions would play-off for the title. From the 2006\u201307 edition until its disbandment, the league was only open to sides whose senior teams were one of the 20 members of the Premier League. As a result, a senior team's relegation from the Premier League would mean relegation for the reserve team from the Premier Reserve League and replacement by the reserve team of the promoted team from the Championship. Tottenham Hotspur decided against entering a side for the 2009\u201310 Premier Reserve League season and other teams followed suit in the 2 following seasons. The final season was the 2011\u201312 season. At the end of that season, it was replaced by an Under-21 competition, called the Professional Development League 1. ==Winners== {|class=wikitable width=60% !Season !Northern Champions !Southern Champions !Play-off Final Winners |- !1999\u20132000 |Liverpool Reserves |Derby County Reserves |\u2013 |- !2000\u201301 |Everton Reserves |Derby County Reserves |\u2013 |- !2001\u201302 |Manchester United Reserves |Ipswich Town Reserves |\u2013 |- !2002\u201303 |Sunderland Reserves |Watford Reserves |\u2013 |- !2003\u201304 |Aston Villa Reserves |Charlton Athletic Reserves |\u2013 |- !2004\u201305 |Manchester United Reserves |Charlton Athletic Reserves !Manchester United Reserves |- !2005\u201306 |Manchester United Reserves |Tottenham Hotspur Reserves !Manchester United Reserves |- !2006\u201307 |Bolton Wanderers Reserves |Reading Reserves !Reading Reserves |- !2007\u201308 |Liverpool Reserves |Aston Villa Reserves !Liverpool Reserves |- !2008\u201309 |Sunderland Reserves |Aston Villa Reserves !Aston Villa Reserves |- !2009\u201310 |Manchester United Reserves |Aston Villa Reserves !Manchester United Reserves |- !2010\u201311 |Blackburn Rovers Reserves |Chelsea Reserves !Chelsea Reserves |- !2011\u201312 |Manchester United Reserves |Aston Villa Reserves !Manchester United Reserves |- |} From 2004 to 2005 onwards, the League held its first play-off between the champions of the two sections.
