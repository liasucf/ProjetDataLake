    "text": "The United States Amateur Championship, commonly known as the U.S. Amateur, is the leading annual golf tournament in the United States for amateur golfers. It is organized by the United States Golf Association and is currently held each August over a 7-day period. In 1894 there were two tournaments called the \"National Amateur Championship\". One of them was played at Newport Country Club and was won by William G. Lawrence, and the other took place at Saint Andrew's Golf Club and was won by Laurence B. Stottard. This state of affairs prompted Charles B. Macdonald of the Chicago Golf Club to call for the creation of a national governing body to authorize an official national championship, and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States, which was soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association, was formed on December 22 of that year. In 1895 it organized both the first U.S. Amateur Championship and the first U.S. Open, both of which were played at Newport Country Club. There are no age or gender restrictions on entry, but players must have a handicap index of 2.4 or less. Originally, entry was restricted to members of USGA-affiliated private clubs (and, presumably, international players who were members of private clubs affiliated with their nations' golf governing bodies), a restriction that was not lifted until 1979. The tournament consists of two days of stroke play, with the leading 64 competitors then playing a knockout competition held at match play to decide the champion. All knockout matches are over 18 holes except for the final, which consists of 36 holes, separated into morning and afternoon 18-hole rounds. Nowadays it is usually won by players in their late teens or early twenties who are working towards a career as a tournament professional. Before World War II more top-level golfers chose to remain amateur, and the average age of U.S. Amateur champions was higher. Many of the leading figures in the history of golf have been U.S. Amateur Champion, including Bobby Jones five times, Jerome Travers four times, Jack Nicklaus twice and Tiger Woods three times (all consecutive; the only player to win three in a row). Woods' first win, as an 18-year-old in 1994, made him the youngest winner of the event, breaking the previous record of 19 years 5 months set by Robert Gardner in 1909. In 2008, New Zealander Danny Lee became the youngest ever winner, only to be eclipsed by 17-year-old An Byeong- hun the following year. Before the professional game became dominant, the event was regarded as one of the majors. This is no longer the case, but the champion still receives an automatic invitation to play in all of the majors except the PGA Championship. In addition, the runner-up also receives an invitation to play in the Masters and the U.S. Open. However, the golfers must maintain their amateur status at the time the events are held (unless they qualify for the tournaments by other means). With the growth in professional golf through the latter half of the 20th century, the U.S. Amateur has become dominated by younger players destined to soon become professionals. In 1981 the USGA established a new championship called the U.S. Mid-Amateur for amateurs aged at least 25 years old in order to give players who had not joined the professional ranks, and those who had regained their amateur status, a chance to play against each other for a national title. ==Field== While most players at the U.S. Amateur advance through sectional qualifying, a few players are exempt each year. #Winners of the U.S. Amateur each of the last ten years. #Runner-up of the U.S. Amateur each of the last three years. #Semi-finalists of the U.S. Amateur each of the last two years. #Quarter- finalists of the U.S. Amateur the previous year. #Any player who qualified for the current year's U.S. Open. #Those returning 72 hole scores from the previous year's U.S. Open. #The amateur with the lowest score from the current year's U.S. Senior Open. #From the U.S. Mid-Amateur: winner each of the last two years and runner-up from the previous year. #From the U.S. Amateur Public Links: winner each of the last two years and runner-up from the previous year. Because the Amateur Public Links was discontinued after its 2014 edition, the runner-up exemption disappeared after the 2015 U.S. Amateur, and the winner's exemption disappeared after 2016. #From the U.S. Junior Amateur: winner each of the last two years and runner-up from the previous year. #From the U.S. Senior Amateur: winner each of the last two years and runner-up from the previous year. #Playing members of the two most recent Walker Cup teams. #Playing members of the two most recent U.S. Eisenhower Trophy teams. #Playing members of the current year's U.S. Men's Copa de las Am\u00e9ricas team. #Winner of the current year's individual NCAA Division I Championship. #Winner of the British Amateur Championship each of the last five years. #Top fifty golfers in World Amateur Golf Ranking. #Winner of the current year Latin America Amateur Championship. In all cases, the exemptions only apply if the player has not turned professional as of the tournament date. ==Winners== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !Year!!Venue!!Winner!!Country!!Score!!Runner-up |- |2020 || Bandon Dunes Golf Resort || Tyler Strafaci || || align=center|1 up || Ollie Osborne |- |2019 || Pinehurst Resort || Andy Ogletree || || align=center|2 & 1 || John Augenstein |- |2018 || Pebble Beach Golf Links || Viktor Hovland || || align=center|6 & 5 || Devon Bling |- |2017 || Riviera Country Club || Doc Redman || || align=center|37th hole || Doug Ghim |- |2016 || Oakland Hills Country Club || Curtis Luck || || align=center|6 & 4 || Brad Dalke |- |2015 || Olympia Fields Country Club || Bryson DeChambeau || || align=center|7 & 6 || Derek Bard |- |2014 || Atlanta Athletic Club || Gunn Yang || || align=center|2 & 1 || Corey Conners |- |2013 || The Country Club || Matthew Fitzpatrick || || align=center|4 & 3 || Oliver Goss |- |2012 || Cherry Hills Country Club || Steven Fox || || align=center|37th hole || Michael Weaver |- |2011 || Erin Hills || Kelly Kraft || || align=center|2 up || Patrick Cantlay |- |2010 || Chambers Bay || Peter Uihlein || || align=center|4 & 2 || David Chung |- |2009 || Southern Hills Country Club || An Byeong-hun || || align=center|7 & 5 || Ben Martin |- |2008 || Pinehurst Resort || Danny Lee || || align=center|5 & 4 || Drew Kittleson |- |2007 || Olympic Club || Colt Knost || || align=center|2 & 1 || Michael Thompson |- |2006 || Hazeltine National Golf Club || Richie Ramsay || || align=center|4 & 2 || John Kelly |- |2005 || Merion Golf Club || Edoardo Molinari || || align=center|4 & 3 || Dillon Dougherty |- |2004 || Winged Foot Golf Club || Ryan Moore || || align=center|2 up || Luke List |- |2003 || Oakmont Country Club || Nick Flanagan || || align=center|37th hole || Casey Wittenberg |- |2002 || Oakland Hills Country Club || Ricky Barnes || || align=center|2 & 1 || Hunter Mahan |- |2001 || East Lake Golf Club || Bubba Dickerson || || align=center|1 up || Robert Hamilton |- |2000 || Baltusrol Golf Club || Jeff Quinney || || align=center|39th hole || James Driscoll |- |1999 || Pebble Beach Golf Links || David Gossett || || align=center|9 & 8 || Kim Sung-yoon |- |1998 || Oak Hill Country Club || Hank Kuehne || || align=center|2 & 1 || Tom McKnight |- |1997 || Cog Hill Golf & Country Club || Matt Kuchar || || align=center|2 & 1 || Joel Kribel |- |1996 || Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club || Tiger Woods (3) || || align=center|38th hole || Steve Scott |- |1995 || Newport Country Club || Tiger Woods (2) || || align=center|2 up || Buddy Marucci |- |1994 || TPC at Sawgrass || Tiger Woods || || align=center|2 up || Trip Kuehne |- |1993 || Champions Golf Club || John Harris || || align=center|5 & 3 || Danny Ellis |- |1992 || Muirfield Village || Justin Leonard || || align=center|8 & 7 || Tom Scherrer |- |1991 || Honors Course || Mitch Voges || || align=center|7 & 6 || Manny Zerman |- |1990 || Cherry Hills Country Club || Phil Mickelson || || align=center|5 & 4 || Manny Zerman |- |1989 || Merion Golf Club || Chris Patton || || align=center|3 & 1 || Danny Green |- |1988 || The Homestead || Eric Meeks || || align=center|7 & 6 || Danny Yates |- |1987 || Jupiter Hills Club || Billy Mayfair || || align=center|4 & 3 || Eric Rebmann |- |1986 || Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club || Buddy Alexander || || align=center|5 & 3 || Chris Kite |- |1985 || Montclair Golf Club || Sam Randolph || || align=center|1 up || Peter Persons |- |1984 || Oak Tree Golf Club || Scott Verplank || || align=center|4 & 3 || Sam Randolph |- |1983 || North Shore Country Club || Jay Sigel (2) || || align=center|8 & 7 || Chris Perry |- |1982 || The Country Club || Jay Sigel || || align=center|8 & 7 || David Tolley |- |1981 || Olympic Club || Nathaniel Crosby || || align=center|1 up || Brian Lindley |- |1980 || The Country Club of North Carolina || Hal Sutton || || align=center|9 & 8 || Bob Lewis |- |1979 || Canterbury Golf Club || Mark O'Meara || || align=center|8 & 7 || John Cook |- |1978 || Plainfield Country Club || John Cook || || align=center|5 & 4 || Scott Hoch |- |1977 || Aronimink Golf Club || John Fought || || align=center|9 & 8 || Doug Fischesser |- |1976 || Bel-Air Country Club || Bill Sander || || align=center|8 & 6 || C.
