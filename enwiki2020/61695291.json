    "text": "Martin Shovlin (born 1960s) is an Irish former Gaelic footballer who played for Naomh Ultan and the Donegal county team. He played against Armagh and scored a point in the 1990 Ulster final, won by Donegal. His performance led him to be awarded the Ulster GAA Writers' Player of the Year. He was part of Donegal's successful 1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship team. He started the semi-final against Mayo at Croke Park. However, he did not play in the final; he had sustained a stiff neck injury which was still affecting him on the morning of the final. John Joe Doherty took his place in the team. Donegal captain Anthony Molloy singled Shovlin out for a special mention in his victory speech. Earlier that year, Hogan Stand indicated that: \"Even objective observers of the game in Donegal recognised that the Shovlin, Gavigan and Reid combination probably represented the best lie of defence in the country. The Dublin trio of Curran, Carr and Heery were the only other combination which vied for that tag, it was suggested\". Shovlin was still playing for Naomh Ultan well into the latter half of the first decade of the twenty-first century. ==References== ==External links== * Martin Shovlin lifts the Sam Maguire Cup Category:1960s births Category:Living people Category:Donegal inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Winners of one All- Ireland medal (Gaelic football) ",
