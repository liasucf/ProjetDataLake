Around 1818, he began to study drawing at the Palais Saint-Pierre (now the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon) with the intention of becoming a draftsman. Many of his classes were taught in a strict Academic style by Pierre R\u00e9voil and Fleury Fran\u00e7ois Richard. His first publicly displayed work was a picture of his grandmother. This formal style did not suit him, however. In 1824, he and a friend from school, Paul Chenavard, left the Palais and took classes from the sculptor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Legendre-H\u00e9ral instead. Dreams of Love In 1827, he decided to go to Paris, where he met Hippolyte Flandrin and his brother, Paul Jean Flandrin. They helped him to enter the workshop of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who emphasized the importance of drawing as the basis of all great art; extolling the beautiful lines of Raphael as opposed to the passionate colors of Rubens. This approach also proved dissatisfying so, when he became a student at the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts de Paris in 1828 and discovered Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, he disavowed Ingres and painted without preliminary sketches; a practice he would follow throughout his life. Immediately after his debut at the Salon in 1831 Ingres, in his turn, disavowed Guichard. The showing was a success, however, and he obtained the patronage of the author, Auguste Jal, a distant relative. In 1833, through his numerous connections, Guichard was able to meet with Adolphe Thiers, Minister of the Interior, who had plans for a museum that would display reproductions of works by the Old Masters, to expose them to the greatest possible number of people. Guichard was chosen to copy the \"Descent from the Cross\" by Daniele da Volterra. After a brief visit with his family in Lyon, he went to Rome. When he had completed the \"Descent', he was assigned to copy The Triumph of Galatea by Rapha\u00ebl. In the meantime, Guichard's former mentor, Ingres, had been named Director of the French Academy in Rome, replacing Horace Vernet, who had become a friend of Guichard's. To everyone's surprise, he approved of the work Guichard was doing. Upon returning to Paris, he was commissioned to do decorative paintings at several churches. In 1839, he married Agathe Lagren\u00e9e (1815-1876); daughter of the painter Anthelme-Fran\u00e7ois Lagren\u00e9e (1774-1832) and granddaughter of Louis-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lagren\u00e9e; whom Vernet had introduced him to in Rome. In 1850, he had the honor of painting alongside Delacroix, decorating the plafond in the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre. The following year, he was decorated with the Legion of Honor. In 1862, he was named Professor of the painting classes at the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts de Lyon, succeeding the late Michel Philibert Genod, and returned to his hometown. Louisa Siefert at Ormes His style of teaching came under heavy criticism and, in 1871, he was suspended by Mayor Jacques-Louis H\u00e9non. His old friend, Chenavard and the art critic Charles Blanc intervened on his behalf and he was named Director of the school by Jules Simon, Minister of Instruction in the Government of National Defense. Upon hearing this news, the other teachers went on strike and he was forced to resign. As a sop, he was put in charge of the municipal painting school. In 1879, he was named the curator at the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon. During his tenure as a teacher, his students included Berthe Morisot, Germain D\u00e9tanger, F\u00e9lix Bracquemond, Alphonse Stengelin and Jean Seignemartin. He died in 1880, following a short illness. == Further reading == * Ren\u00e9 Chazelle, Joseph Guichard, peintre lyonnais (1806-1880), disciple d'Ingres et de Delacroix, Presses universitaires de Lyon, 1992 Preview Online @ Google Books * Bertrand Dumas, \"La restauration du sacr\u00e9: La Descente de Croix de Joseph Guichard\", in Art Absolument, Spring 2006 Online == External links == *More works by Guichard @ ArtNet Category:1806 births Category:1880 deaths Category:French painters Category:French Impressionist painters Category:French muralists Category:French art curators ",
