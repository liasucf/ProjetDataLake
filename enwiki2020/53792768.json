His father, Natan Grinberg, a member of the Communist Party in his youth, held a high position in the leadership of Communist Bulgaria after the war. In 1954, the family moved to Israel and settled in Bat Yam. On his arrival, Jacques went to school in a kibbutz, and at a young age began studying art at the Avni School in Tel Aviv. He probably was not exposed directly to the horrors of the Holocaust, but the subject was not repressed, certainly not by his father, who already in 1945 had published a book of documents attesting to the attempts of the Bulgarian fascist government to eliminate Bulgarian Jewry and to the involvement of the army and the police in the expulsion and extermination of the Jews of Thrace and Macedonia. After the book disappeared from the bookshops in Bulgaria, he published it again in Israel (in Bulgarian). ;1961-1970 In 1961, Natan Grinberg published another book in Israel, with a painting by his son on its cover. Jacques\u2019s communistic world view and his acute sensitivity to the events of the time and to man\u2019s fate were an inseparable part of the habitus he grew up in, and are embedded in his work. After showing his works in several exhibitions in Tel Aviv galleries, Jacques moved to Paris in 1962, L'estampe contemporaine \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale : (exposition), Paris, (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, 25 octobre-9 d\u00e9cembre) 1973, catalogue par Fran\u00e7oise Woimant, gallica.bnf and in a short time found his place among the first artists who promoted the \u201cNew Figuration\u201d orientation, which proposed a contemporary painting that struck out against the abstract, which had taken over everywhere. Grinberg\u2019s paintings \u2013 large in format, bold in their colors \u2013 focused on human and animal images, and were highly successful. He was represented by a leading gallery and his paintings were shown in well-regarded exhibitions. But the failure of the Students\u2019 Revolt in 1968 and the collapse of the gallery that represented him (and sold his paintings at a loss, which broke the market for his works) created a new reality for him, and he found it difficult to recover. ;1971-1983 Following the closure of the Galerie Schoeller Jacques Grinberg experienced significant financial difficulty and went to live in Israel for a year. His friend, the Israeli poet Meir Wieseltier, chose several of his drawings and lithographs for the covers of his poetic books and for the first issue of Proza 21, an Israeli literary magazine. On his return to Paris he rented a studio in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. His scope of inspiration widened and he began to include new influences such as the Kabbalah and Tao. His wide-ranging pictorial research became increasingly exploratory. In 1972, the Galerie de France published, in partnership with the Atelier Clot, and showed lithographs by Jacques Grinberg as well as Pierre Alechinsky, Err\u00f3, Asger Jorn, Roberto Matta, Roland Topor and Maurice Wyckaert. The following year he worked again with Jo Verbrugghen, the Belgian dealer, on a solo exhibition, which was held at the Sint Pietersabdij Museum in Ghent. In 1974, he returned to the Montparnasse neighbourhood, where he had studios in the rue des Plantes and then in rue Campagne Premi\u00e8re. At that time Jacques Grinberg's life was particularly hectic and he briefly struggled with psychiatric issues. Supported by his family, he continued to paint. He travelled in Mexico and Greece and brought back numerous ideas and works made in those countries. He also lived and worked for a while in London. ;1984-1994 A fresh start in Israel brought about three solo exhibitions, initially at the Dvir Gallery in 1984 and 1985 and then at the 27 Gallery in 1987. Jacques Grinberg's work appealed to an enthusiastic audience and enjoyed widespread media coverage. In 1987 Grinberg returned to France. He made contact with C\u00e9r\u00e8s Franco, a friend of twenty years' standing who was then director of the Galerie L'\u0152il-de-B\u0153uf in Paris. She supported him and organized four solo exhibitions for him between 1988 and 1994. In 1991 he settled in Malakoff in the Paris suburbs. ;1995-2011 During this period, Jacques Grinberg became increasingly reclusive and devoted his time exclusively to his creative work. His pictorial production was self- assured and intense. He started to write and published several collections. A number of young artists sought him out, and of these several were greatly influenced by his thinking. In 1997, the Galerie Jacques in Ann Arbor (Michigan, USA) exhibited his engravings. In 2002, the Galerie Id\u00e9es d'artistes organised what would be his last solo exhibition, entitled V\u00e9h\u00e9ment, m\u00e9lancolique. Some of his works are still regularly shown throughout France at public exhibitions of the C\u00e9r\u00e8s Franco collection. In 2008, the Galerie Polad-Hardouin \u2013 wishing to pay homage to the New Figuration painters of the 1960s \u2013 organised a manifesto exhibition entitled New Figuration: Act III. Jacques Grinberg showed works from this period in the exhibition alongside others including Maryan, Michel Macr\u00e9au (1935-1995), Paul Rebeyrolle, Antonio Saura, John Christoforou and Bengt Lindstr\u00f6m. Resolutely independent and passionate about painting, he continued his creative explorations with great freedom until his death on 31 May 2011. Jacques Grinberg died in Paris. A bilingual catalogue accompanies the exhibition at the Mishkan Museum of Art (Ein Harod (Meuhad)), in collaboration with The Homme bleu Foundation. In addition to texts by the curators, the catalogue contains an article by the poet Meir Wieseltier.
