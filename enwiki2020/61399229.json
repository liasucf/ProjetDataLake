    "text": "Klaus M\u00fcllen (born January 2 1947) is a German chemist working in the fields of polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology. He is known for the synthesis and exploration of the properties of graphene-like nanostructures and their potential applications in organic electronics. == Early life and education == M\u00fcllen was born in Cologne. He studied chemistry there and was awarded a PhD in 1971 under the supervision of Fabian Gerson at the University of Basel. He specialized in electron spin resonance spectroscopy and his dissertation was on nuclear resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies on bridged annulenes. He then completed post- doctoral studies at the ETH Zurich under Jean Fran\u00e7ois Michel Oth (1926-2003) and received his habilitation in 1977 with a thesis on dynamic NMR spectroscopy and electrochemistry. == Research career == In 1979 he became professor of organic chemistry at the University of Cologne, in 1983 he went to the University of Mainz as a professor. Since 1989 he has been director and scientific member of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. In 2016 he became emeritus. Since 1995 he has been honorary professor at the University of Mainz and at the Gutenberg Research College of the University of Mainz. He is an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society His research interests are in the field of preparative macro- and supramolecular chemistry. Among other things, his group has succeeded in synthesizing and characterizing hitherto unattainable large polycyclic aromatics such as superphenalene, which has a molecular mass of 1182 g\u00b7mol\u22121 and consists of 34 condensed benzene rings.From Hexa\u2010peri\u2010hexabenzocoronene to \u201cSuperacenes\u201d Structure of superphenalene He has developed small disc-like organic building blocks using alkyl-substituted hexabenzocoronene, and in particular HBC-C12Hexakis(n-dodecyl)-peri-hexabenzocoronene, dodecyl-substituted hexabenzocoronene. \\- which self-assembles into crystalline liquid-phase structures (columnar liquid crystals) as potential organic field-effect transistors.H.

The considered two-dimensional benzene ring structures are examples of subunits of graphene lattices (graphene nanostructures). The graphene-like structures synthesized and investigated by M\u00fcllen include two-dimensional bands of less than 50 nanometers width with jagged edges. Of interest here are the electronic conduction properties and spintronics properties with a view to future replacement of silicon-semiconductor technology. GRC Fellow Klaus M\u00fcllen receives Hermann Staudinger Award 2016. In synthesis, he introduced a new method in graphene polymer chemistry: soft-landing mass spectrometry.

Applications include synthetic light-emitting organic materials (such as OLEDs) and incorporation of molecular defects (defect engineering) organic analogues of semiconductor technology. == Selected awards and honorary posts == * 2017: Member of the Academia EuropaeaAcademy of Europe M\u00fcllen Klaus accessed July 30 2019 * 2017: Hamburger Wissenschaftspreis (shared with Xinliang Feng)Hamburg Science Award 2017 goes to Klaus M\u00fcllen and Xinliang Feng Pressemitteilung der Universit\u00e4t Dresden vom 26.
