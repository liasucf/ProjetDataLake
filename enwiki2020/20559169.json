    "text": "'Kevin () is the anglicized form of the Irish masculine given name ' (, , , Latinized ), composed of Irish (Old Irish ) \"dear; noble\" and (Old Irish ) \"birth\". The variant Kevan is anglicized from , an Irish diminutive form.A Dictionary of First Names. Oxford University Press (2007) s.v. \"Kevin\". The feminine version of the name is (anglicised as Keeva or Kweeva). ==History== Saint Kevin (d. 618) founded Glendalough abbey in the Kingdom of Leinster in 6th-century Ireland. Canonized in 1903, he is one of the patron saints of the Archdiocese of Dublin. Caomh\u00e1n of Inisheer, the patron saint of Inisheer, Aran Islands, is properly anglicized Cavan or Kevan, but often also referred to as \"Kevin\". The name was rarely given before the 20th century but has been \"widely adopted throughout the English-speaking world\" since, surging in popularity during the 1950s. The sudden rise in popularity may be tied to actor Kevin McCarthy, who first became famous with Death of a Salesman (1951). In the United States the name's popularity peaked at rank 11 in 1963. It has steadily decreased in popularity since then, but is still given with moderate frequency, at rank 89 as of 2016. The name followed a similar trajectory in the United Kingdom, gaining popularity in the 1950s, peaking in the 1960s, gradually declining in the 1970s to 1980s, and falling out of the top 100 most popularly given names by the 1990s. Oxford's A Dictionary of First Names suggests that anglicized Kevin may have influenced the adoption of Kelvin (in origin a river name) as a modern given name, which peaked in popularity at about the same time, albeit to a much lesser extent (peaking at rank 209 as of 1961 in the US).A Dictionary of First Names. Oxford University Press (2007) s.v. \"Kelvin\". Conversely, in non-English-speaking Europe, the name picked up popularity in the 1980s. The name had been introduced to Europe via pop culture, and was notorious for being extremely popular among lower class parents during the end of 1980s to 2000s. The name peaked markedly in the early 1990s, reaching first rank in France during 1989-1994, during 1991-1992 in Switzerland and in 1991 in Germany. The 1991 peak in German-speaking Europe is due to the Christmas comedy film Home Alone, marketed as \"Kevin \u2013 Allein zu Haus\" in German (named for protagonist \"Kevin McCallister\", played by 10-year- old Macaulay Culkin). Especially in Germany, the name became associated with low social status, an attitude popularised in German journalism based on a 2009 master thesis on primary teachers' reactions to children's given names. \"Kevin\" or \"Kevinismus\" in German has become a short-hand for short-lived fads in given names based in pop culture.Katrin Pribyl, \"KEVINISMUS\" Wie Namen die Zukunft von Kindern beeinflussen , Welt, 26 February 2008.Sarah Zhang, [The Strange German Disease Called \"Kevinism\": Can a Lame Name Mess Up Your Life?], Discoblog (discovermagazine.com), 1 February 2012. \"Kevinometer: Kennen Sie das Kevinismus-Risiko Ihrer Lieblingsnamen?\" (beliebte-vornamen.de) ==People== * Kevin Abernathy (born 1991), American editor and occasional host of shows on the Game Grumps platform * Kevin Abley (born 1935), Australian rules footballer * Kevin Anderson (born 1960), American actor * Kevin Anderson (born 1986), South African tennis player * Kevin J.
