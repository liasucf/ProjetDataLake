    "text": "In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, Dubthach D\u00f3eltenga (\"beetle-tongue\", beetles being proverbially black) was a cynical ally of Fergus mac R\u00f3ich who rarely had a good word to say about anyone. He accompanied Fergus to escort Deirdre and Naoise back to Ireland under the orders of Conchobar and later followed Fergus into exile in Connacht following Naoise's murder under Conchobar's orders. He was responsible for the death of Conchobar's son, among others. He later fought beside him in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, although at one point Fergus kicked him right out of the camp for his plans to kill C\u00fa Chulainn. ==References== Category:Ulster Cycle Category:Characters in T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge ",
