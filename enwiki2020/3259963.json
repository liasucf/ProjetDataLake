When Maggie is unable to gather any Easter eggs, Homer decides to take the other children's eggs. Maggie is delighted, but Hugs Bunny, who is refereeing the egg hunt, voices his immediate displeasure. Homer and Hugs get into a huge fight. Meanwhile, Marge goes on a tour of the mansion, led by Quimby's estranged wife, Martha Quimby, but things quickly go downhill when the fight spills into Quimby's office. Marge is embarrassed by Homer's childish actions, and her friends determine she is bad news and shun her. At home, Marge tells Homer exactly how she feels, and while Homer unsuccessfully tries to find some new friends for her, she meets some members of the Cheery Red Tomatoes while walking down a street. She quickly impresses the group's leader, Tammy (voiced by Lily Tomlin), and after participating in a few low-key meetings is soon invited to become a member of the women's group. However, when it comes time for the initiation, Tammy asks Marge to assist in their efforts to break into Burns's mansion to steal $1 million in Faberg\u00e9 eggs. They explain they are a group that raises funds for charity, and that Burns once promised them that amount to donate to a children's hospital; however, at a press conference, the selfish millionaire announced he would keep the money for a life-extending procedure for himself. Marge is reluctant to go ahead with the burglary, however bad of a person Burns is, but when told her membership rides on her participation, she agrees to cast her morals aside. At home, Homer finds Marge's Tomatoes folder lying around the house and after rummaging through it, learns about the group's plans to break into Burns's safe. As he tries to get to the mansion to stop her, his reckless driving gets the attention of the police, who follow him, after leaving Officer Eddie behind to direct traffic. Meanwhile, Marge is able to sneak onto Burns's grounds through an air duct and unlock a gate; from there, the women crack open the safe and begin helping themselves to the Faberg\u00e9 eggs that sit inside. As the women are leaving, Chief Wiggum and Burns arrive at the mansion to arrest the women. Homer arrives to stop Marge from doing something she might regret, but finds himself a prime suspect in the heist. However, once everything is explained, Marge realizes she does not need the group to make friends; after all, she already has one very special friend \u2013 Homer. The group returns the eggs to Burns, but Marge later reveals that she hid one in her hair and gives it to them before departing. Meanwhile, Lisa is seeking summer opportunities and decides on studying abroad in Rome. After meeting with Principal Skinner about it, Lisa realizes that she meets all but one of the requirements: being fluent in Italian. She tries to convince Principal Skinner that she speaks Italian, but the principal is skeptical. Rather than putting her on the spot, he decides to test Lisa later. This gives Lisa time to hire a tutor, who shockingly turns out to be Milhouse; Milhouse explains that ever since he was a baby, he spends some time in Tuscany every summer with his grandmother, Sophia, who only spoke to him in Italian, as she hated English due to being left pregnant by an American G.I. after World War II, whom is his uncle \"bastardo.\" Milhouse is actually quite good at teaching Lisa, and before long, Lisa's speaking the language fluently and even develops a crush on Milhouse. However, just as it seems that Milhouse's unrequited feelings for Lisa are about to be reciprocated, she catches him with a girl named Angelica. This makes Lisa mad and she starts chasing him around while beating him up and cursing him in Italian, just like his grandmother did whenever he spoke in English to her. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes Category:2005 American television episodes it:Episodi de I Simpson (diciassettesima stagione)#Le allegre comari di Rossor ",
