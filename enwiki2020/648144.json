    "text": "The Gold Cadillac is a cocktail made with Galliano, white cr\u00e8me de cacao, and cream. It is classified as an \"after-dinner\" drink, a digestif. This cocktail originated at Poor Red's in the town of El Dorado, California. ==History== Sometime in 1952, a woman and her new fianc\u00e9 came into Poor Red's, a small restaurant in the Gold Country of California, located in the Town of Eldorado on the Lincoln Highway. They were on their way to Lake Tahoe, Nevada to celebrate their engagement. The Couple asked Frank Cline, long time bartender to create a cocktail in their honor. After some trial and error, Cline finally created a drink using Galliano, Creme de Cacao, half and half and blended with ice. The couple loved it and since it had no name, Cline asked the couple what they wanted to call it. The couple decided to name it after their brand new Gold Cadillac, parked out front. ==References== Category:Cocktails with chocolate liqueur Category:Cocktails with liqueur Category:Creamy cocktails ",
