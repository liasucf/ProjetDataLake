The stadium has a capacity of 6,000 people. ==History== The Estadio Municipal (Municipal Stadium) opened in 1964. In 1983, it was named for comic Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez (Palillo) in recognition of his contributions to the original construction of the Sports City. The stadium was remodeled in 2014 at a cost of 25 million pesos, its first major maintenance in 15 years. The track bears an IAAF Class 2 designation, one of three such tracks in Mexico City, allowing it to be used for a variety of international events. Among the international events held at the stadium was the 2018 World Modern Pentathlon Championships, held in Mexico City to mark the 50th anniversary of the Olympic Games. ==Uses== ===1968 Summer Olympics=== The Estadio Municipal, as well as two adjoining fields in the Sports City, hosted the field hockey competitions of the 1968 Summer Olympics. For the Games, the 6,160-seat capacity of the roofed grandstands was augmented by additional temporary stands, with approximately 1,200 seats, installed in the end zones. Rest areas for athletes, dressing rooms, showers and a cafeteria were located in a building adjacent to the stadium. The playing field was conditioned in accordance with the regulations of the International Hockey Federation. 1968 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 1. pp. 76\u20137 ===American football=== From 2016 to 2018, the stadium was home several teams of the Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional. Initially, all of the league's Mexico City-based teams, including the Raptors and Mexicas, used the venue until relocating to other sports facilities in the Mexico City area. In the 2018 season, the Raptors were the first Mexico City-based squad to move out when they made the Estadio Jos\u00e9 Ortega Mart\u00ednez in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, their home, while the Mexicas announced that they would move to the Estadio Wilfrido Massieu in 2019. ===Non-sports=== One of the stages of the annual Vive Latino festival, which is primarily held in the Sports City's Foro Sol, is set up on the field at the stadium. In late 2018, the stadium was used by Mexico City's government as a shelter for migrants traveling in the late 2018 migrant caravan from Central America. In preparation for the arrival of migrants, the field was covered, kitchen facilities prepared and tanks with a capacity of 10,000 liters of drinking water were put in place. The shelter will have a capacity of 6,500 when all preparations are complete. ==References== ==External links== * Official page of the Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\" Category:Sports venues in Mexico City Jes\u00fas \"Palillo\" Mart\u00ednez Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Mexico Category:American football venues in Mexico Category:Venues of the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic field hockey venues ",
