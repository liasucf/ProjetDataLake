Released theatrically on October 5, 1959, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. == Synopsis == Woody tricks Gabby Gator into a swampland chase. The banjo-plucking alligator shoots down what he thinks is a southbound goose, except that it's a woodpecker. In the end, Gabby is launched into outer space. The cartoon contains an in-joke reference; when Gabby shoots down Woody, he finds Woody is wearing a dogtag reading, \"In case of accident, contact Walter Lantz, Hollywood, California.\" ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1959\".
