    "text": "United States Live is the third album release by avant-garde singer-songwriter Laurie Anderson. Released as a 5-record boxed set (later reissued on four CDs), the album was recorded at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City in February 1983. United States was Anderson's magnum opus performance-art piece featuring musical numbers, spoken word pieces, and animated vignettes about life in the United States. Segments ranged from humorous, such as \"Yankee See,\" which gently chided Anderson's record label, Warner Bros. Records, for signing her in the first place, to the apocalyptic anthem \"O Superman,\" which had been an unexpected Top 10 hit for Anderson on the UK music charts in 1981. Originally, United States was presented over the course of two nights, running some eight hours. The United States Live box set is a truncated rendering of the performance, omitting many segments that were solely of a visual nature. Among the songs performed on the album was \"Language is a Virus (from Outer Space),\" a pop-like song based upon a phrase attributed to William S. Burroughs. Anderson later performed a modified arrangement of the song in her 1986 concert film Home of the Brave. Although Anderson has since created numerous other major performance pieces (i.e. Moby- Dick, Stories from the Nerve Bible, Happiness, The End of the Moon), United States Live remains, to date, the only serious attempt at producing anything approaching a full-length recording of any of these performances, although her previous album Big Science and her segment of the compilation You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With consisted of studio-recorded excerpts from United States. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Laurie Anderson except as indicated. ===Part One=== ====Side one==== # \"Say Hello\" \u2013 5:01 # \"Walk the Dog\" \u2013 6:45 # \"Violin Solo\" \u2013 2:13 # \"Closed Circuits\" For voice and amplified mike stand \u2013 6:03 # \"For a Large and Changing Room\" \u2013 2:50 # \"Pictures of It\" For acoustic Tape Bow \u2013 1:32 # \"The Language of the Future\" \u2013 8:02 ====Side two==== # \"Cartoon Song\" \u2013 1:12 # \"Small Voice\" For speaker-in-mouth \u2013 2:03 # \"Three Walking Songs\" For Tape Bow Violin \u2013 4:19 # \"The Healing Horn\" \u2013 3:01 # \"New Jersey Turnpike\" \u2013 11:19 see New Jersey Turnpike ====Side three==== # \"So Happy Birthday\" \u2013 6:23 # \"EngliSH\" \u2013 2:08 # \"Dance of Electricity\" \u2013 3:02 see Nikola Tesla # \"Three Songs for Paper, Film and Video\" \u2013 6:02 # \"Sax Solo\" For Tape Bow Violin \u2013 0:55 # \"Sax Duet\" \u2013 0:38 # \"Born, Never Asked\" \u2013 5:16 ===Part Two=== ====Side four==== # \"From the Air\" \u2013 2:46 # \"Beginning French\" \u2013 2:16 # \"O Superman\" \u2013 11:05 # \"Talkshow\" \u2013 6:57 ====Side five==== # \"Frames for the Pictures\" \u2013 1:08 # \"Democratic Way\" \u2013 1:41 # \"Looking for You\" \u2013 1:19 # \"Walking and Falling\" \u2013 1:21 # \"Private Property\" \u2013 3:04 # \"Neon Duet\" For violin and neon bow \u2013 3:52 # \"Let X=X\" \u2013 6:17 # \"The Mailman's Nightmare\" \u2013 0:46 # \"Difficult Listening Hour\" \u2013 3:10 ====Side six==== # \"Language is a virus from outer space \u2013 William S.
