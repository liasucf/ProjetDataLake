    "text": "Michael B\u00fchl is a professor of Computational and Theoretical Chemistry in the School of Chemistry, University of St. Andrews. He has published work on the performance of various density functionals, modelling thermal and medium effects, transition-metal NMR of metalloenzymes, modelling of homogeneous catalysis, and molecular dynamics of transition metal complexes. == Biography == B\u00fchl was born in 1962. He earned his PhD at the University of Erlangen- Nuremberg's Institute for Organic Chemistry (Institut f\u00fcr organische Chemie), where his thesis advisor was Paul von Ragu\u00e9 Schleyer. In 1992, he worked as a post-doctoral researcher with Henry F. Schaefer III (University of Georgia). He was an Oberassistent at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich between 1993 and 1999. In 1999, he also worked at Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung, M\u00fclheim. He was on the faculty at the University of Z\u00fcrich from 1998 to 2000 and then at University of Wuppertal from 2000 to 2008. He is Chair of Computational Chemistry at the University of St. Andrews since 2008. == Research interests == B\u00fchl's group applies the tools of computational quantum chemistry to study a variety of chemical and biochemical systems and their properties, focussing on transition-metal and f-element chemistry, homogeneous and bio-catalysis, and NMR properties. The methods employed are mostly rooted in density-functional theory (DFT), including quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) calculations and first- principles molecular dynamics simulations. == References == == External links == * Buehl's research group __FORCETOC__ Category:Scottish chemists Category:Academics of the University of St Andrews Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:Computational chemistry ",
