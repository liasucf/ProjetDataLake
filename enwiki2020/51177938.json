In 930 AD, emperor Erayappa of Ganga Dynasty led his troops to south west of Mysore and after conquering, called it Bayalnad meaning the land of swamps. After Erayappa, his sons Rachamalla and Battunga fought each other for the new kingdom of their father's legacy. Rachamalla was killed and Battunga became the undisputed ruler of Bayalnad. In 12th century AD, Gangas were dethroned from Bayalnad by Kadamba dynastyThe Kadamba kula A history of ancient and medieval Karnatak , By George M. Moraces BX furtado &sons; Bombay 1931 of North Canara.https://archive.org/details/kadambakula035210mbp In 1104 AD Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala invaded Bayalnad followed by Vijayanagara dynasty in 16th century. In 1610 AD, Udaiyar Raja Wadiyar of Mysore drove out Vijayanagara General and became the ruler of Bayalnad and the Nilgiris. Bayalnad is the present Wayanad. ==Mysore Sultans== When Wayanad was under Hyder Ali's rule, the ghat road from Vythiri to Thamarassery invented.Madrass District Gazetteeers, The Nilgiris. By W. Francic. Madras 1908 Pages 90-104 Then the British rulers developed this route to Carter road.Report of the Administration of Mysore 1863-64. British Parliament Library Tipu Sultan After Hyder Ali, his son Tipu Sultan took control over the territory. ==British rule== When Wayanad was under Tipu Sultan's rule British invasion started. Tussle and turbulent times followed. The British claimed Wayanad under 1792 treaty of Srirangapatna citing it was part of Malabar. Tipu Sultan went in appeal before the Governor General. Considering his arguments, relying on the successive Karnatic rule for centuries in Wayanad and its geographical detachment from Malabar, in 1798, Governor General Lord Mornington declared by proclamationProclamation No:CLXXXLL , A. Collection of treaties and engagements , By W.Logan, Calicut 1879 that Wayanad had not been ceded to the East India Company by the treaty of 1792. Consequently, the British troops withdrew from Wayanad conceding to Tipu's rule. In 1799, after the fall of Sultan, the British handed over Wayanad by treaty of 1799 to the Raja of Mysore. But by a supplementary treaty dated 29 December 1803 the East India Company repossessed South Wayanad and thereafter administrated by Col. Arthur Wellesley from Srirangapatna. ==Etymology== The Jain temple located at Wayanad was used as a battery (ammunition store) for Tipu Sulthan's marching armies and hence the town got its name \"Sultan's Battery\". Sultan Bathery was originally called as Hannaredu veethiwynad and it's peoples c gopalan nair a kannada word means twelve streets. The name was changed in the 18th century, when Tipu Sultan used the Jain Temple for his armoury (Battery). And thus the town became known as Sultan's Battery, which in Portuguese Malayalam was batheria and late became bathery. But before having the name Sulthan's Bathery, It was called \"Ganapathi vattam\", Which is derived from the presence of the Mahaganapathi temple of the town. 'Vattam' here means area.Accounts_and_papers_of_the_House_of_Comm see page 335 wayand report ==People== One important characteristic feature of the Sulthan Bathery is the large adivasi population, consisting mainly of Paniyas, Kurumas, Ooralis, Kadans, Kattunaikkans are the different aboriginal tribes. The Kurmas is the most developed among them. They are small land owners, whereas the members of other tribes are mostly labourers. Wayanad district stands first in the case of adivasi population (about 36%) among other districts in the state. Sulthan Bathery has a large settler population. There are people from almost all parts of Kerala who migrated to this fertile land for building up their lives. One Third population of Sulthan bathery is constituted by Muslims. Christians constitute One fifth population, and rest of the population belongs to Hindus. Their hard work and sacrifice helped them to prosper.
