In his later years he managed sides in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. ==Playing career== Born in the Tollcross area of Glasgow, Harris began his senior career began with Partick Thistle, whom he joined from Vale of Clyde F.C. in 1913. He spent seven seasons with Partick, \"guesting\" for Distillery and Fulham during World War I before joining Newcastle United for \u00a33,300 in May 1920. He played 174 league games for the Magpies, scoring 87 times. He was a regular scorer in Newcastle's FA Cup campaigns and scored a total of 14 goals in 20 appearances in that competition. He helped them win the 1923\u201324 FA Cup, scoring the first goal in the final. That season he also earned his first (and only) cap for the Scottish national side, in a 1\u20131 draw with England at Wembley.Neil Harris - A Squad, Scottish Football Association. Harris joined Notts County for \u00a33,000 in November 1925, then joined Oldham Athletic in 1927. He returned to Scotland with Third Lanark in 1929 before accepting the position of player-manager at Burton Town prior to the 1931-32 season. ==Managerial career== Harris spent one year in charge of Burton then moved to former side Distillery in a purely managerial capacity. He was appointed manager of Swansea Town in 1934 and soon after arriving at the Vetch Field signed his son John, a defender, from Swindon Town. Incidentally, Neil's brother Joshua ('Jack') was also a professional footballer, who played for several years with Leeds United among others; however, they were not related to Joe Harris, also from east Glasgow who played for Partick and Newcastle in the same era. Five years later Harris moved to his son's former side, after Ted Vizard left Swindon in June 1939. Due to the impending war, he was originally only offered a year's contract but, after negotiation, this was extended to end in March 1941. Just three games into his first season in charge, the Football League programme was abandoned, and Harris remained in charge for the club's season in the South West Regional League. During this season, players were often called up for military duties in the build-up to a game, and every club in the league used \"guests\" to make up the starting eleven - sometimes players even played under aliases to avoid detection by their officers. Before one game at Bristol City, Harris, now 45, was forced to come out of retirement himself to make up the numbers. He borrowed a pair of boots which were too small, and lost two toenails as the Town lost 5\u20132. By the end of the season, it was decided that the club could no longer continue whilst the war did, and Harris was relieved of his duties in August 1940, with the intention of him returning to the hotseat when the war ended. Harris died a year later. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Partick Thistle F.C. players Category:St Mirren F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Vale of Clyde F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:English Football League players Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. wartime guest players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Third Lanark A.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:Swindon Town F.C. managers Category:Place of death missing Category:Association football forwards ",
