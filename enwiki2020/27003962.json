    "text": "\"Dying Breed\" is a song by the American heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch. It is the third single from their second album War Is the Answer, and their sixth single overall. The single was released exclusively through Spinefarm Records as a digital download in the UK on November 16, 2009. The single also features the song, \"Succubus\", a bonus track from War Is the Answer. \"Dying Breed\" was featured on the Splatterhouse video game soundtrack in 2010. ==Writing and recording== Guitarist Zoltan Bathory told Metal Hammer: \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t have an awful lot of time in which to make the new record, and this was the last track that Ivan added his vocals to. That\u2019s why we originally had it down as a bonus track, because it was being worked on right at the end of our schedule\u2026 but when we heard the finished thing, we knew it had to go on the album. Track One! \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s a bit like \u2018Ashes\u2019 on the first album \u2013 196 bpm, really fast, a heavy aggressive track with a great melodic chorus. It really was the missing piece of the puzzle\u2026\u201d ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Ivan Moody \u2013 vocals *Jason Hook \u2013 guitars *Zoltan Bathory \u2013 guitars *Matt Snell \u2013 bass *Jeremy Spencer \u2013 drums ==References== ==External links== * Category:2009 singles Category:Five Finger Death Punch songs Category:2009 songs Category:Spinefarm Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Kevin Churko Category:Songs written by Zoltan Bathory Category:Songs written by Ivan Moody (vocalist) Category:Songs written by Jason Hook Category:Songs written by Jeremy Spencer (drummer) Category:Nu metal songs ",
