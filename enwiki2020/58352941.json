Schoolcraft's made-up words have disputed sources.Clarke Historical Library, Central Michigan University, Bibliography by county and region, including origin of county names While he was a devotee of Native American words and culture, some of his words may have originated with tribes from other areas of the country, such as New York or the Northeast, from which many settlers to Michigan came from. Real Native words were eradicated, and he substituted made-up words, sometimes with a kernel of Indian language or sound in them. Below are the ten counties with names Schoolcraft has created and their meanings: * Alcona County \u2013 \"the good plain\"Powers, p. 94 * Allegan County \u2013 \"the front\" or \"the mound builders\" * Alpena County \u2013 \"the good partridge country\". * Arenac County \u2013 \"a sandy place for good footing\". * Iosco County \u2013 Unknown Meaning * Kalkaska County \u2013 after Schoolcraft's family name, Calcraft (K's added later).Michigan History, County Names. * Leelanau County \u2013 after a Native American woman in Schoolcraft's writings, meaning \"delight of life\". * Lenawee County \u2013 \"man\".Michigan History, Arts and Libraries on sources of County names. * Oscoda County \u2013 \"pebbly prairie\". * Tuscola County \u2013 \"flat lands\". === Former county names === Many counties in Central and Northern Michigan have former names that were either Native Americans or Schoolcraft neologisms.
