    "text": "Christopher John Sansom is a British writer of historical crime novels. He was born in 1952 in Edinburgh and was educated at the University of Birmingham, where he took a BA and then a PhD in history. After working in a variety of jobs, he decided to retrain as a solicitor. He practised in Sussex as a lawyer for the disadvantaged, before leaving the legal profession to become a full- time writer. He lives in Sussex. ==Work== Sansom came to prominence with the Shardlake series, his historical mystery series set in the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century. The series' main character is the hunchbacked lawyer Matthew Shardlake, who is assisted in his adventures by Mark Poer, then Jack Barak and also Nicholas Overton. Shardlake works on commission initially from Thomas Cromwell in Dissolution and Dark Fire, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in Sovereign and Revelation and Queen Catherine Parr in Heartstone and Lamentation. Dark Fire won the 2005 Crime Writers' Association Historical Dagger. After Dark Fire was published, a Sunday Times review made this comment: \"Historical crime fiction is sometimes little more than a modern adventure in fancy dress. Not so the novels of CJ Sansom, whose magnificent books set in the reign of Henry VIII bring to life the sounds and smells of Tudor England...\"C. J. Sansom article at Greene Heaton. Shardlake works as a lawyer in the service of Henry's younger daughter, the Lady Elizabeth, in the novel Tombland (published in 2018), investigating a murder during the time of Kett's Rebellion in Norfolk. \"Tombland is more of a grand historical epic than a tightly packed whodunnit, like some of the earlier novels; but 800 pages in Shardlake\u2019s company will always fly by\". https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/tombland-cj-sansom-review, Tombland Review Dissolution was adapted in 10 episodes for BBC Radio 4 in September 2012, and Revelation in March 2017. Sansom explained his reasons for making his protagonist a barrister, in an interview with The Guardian. > \"I thought it made sense for Shardlake to be a lawyer for a number of > reasons. First, the law was my profession: I find legal practice endlessly > interesting. Second, it existed then and now, so it provides a point of > contact for readers. And third, it's democratic: it offers a way into any > number of mysteries, and puts Shardlake in the way of an endless variety of > characters.\" Sansom also said that he plans to write further Shardlake novels taking the lawyer into the reign of Elizabeth I. He has also written Winter in Madrid, a thriller set in Spain in 1940 in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and Dominion, an alternate history novel set in a Britain following a fictional Axis victory in World War II. About the latter novel, a Guardian review called the premise \"an invented mid-20th century Britain that has the intricate detail and delineation of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, though thankfully described in better prose\".https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/06/dominion-cj-sansom- review, Dominion by CJ Sansom \u2013 review ==Awards== Dark Fire won the 2005 Ellis Peters Historical Dagger, awarded by the Crime Writers' Association (CWA). Sansom himself was \"Very Highly Commended\" in the 2007 CWA Dagger in the Library award, for the Shardlake series.the CWA Dagger in the Library 2007 \u2013 C.J. Sansom shortlisted for the Duncan Lawrie Dagger Award. Dominion won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History.Sidewise Award Nominees, SF Site News, 1 July 2013. ==Politics== Sansom is Scottish by birth. He opposes Scottish independence, a prospect he describes as \"literally heartbreaking\". Following the publication of his 2012 novel Dominion, in which his depiction of an alternate history where Germany won World War II includes the Scottish National Party acting as collaborators with the British Nazi state, he stated that \"A party which is often referred to by its members, as the SNP is, as the National Movement should send a chill down the spine of anyone who remembers what those words have often meant in Europe\", before going on to describe the party as \"deeply dangerous, with no politics in the conventional sense, believing only in the old dream that the unleashing of 'national spirit' and 'national pride' can solve a country's problems.\" He donated \u00a3294,000 to the Better Together group which campaigned for a \"no\" vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. He also said that the Yes Scotland campaign had \"dubious\" financial backing. ==Bibliography== ===Matthew Shardlake Series=== * * * * * * * ===Other novels=== * * == References == ==External links== * Schoolboy rivalries in the Spanish civil war A review of Winter in Madrid, in Telegraph, 26 February 2006 *A wherry across the Thames A review of Dark Fire, by Stella Duffy, in The Guardian, 6 November 2004 *Spanish Civil War, stripped of Hemingway's romance A review of Winter in Madrid, by Katherine Bailey, in The Philadelphia Inquirer, 20 January 2008 *Revelation A review of \"Revelation\", by Peter Kemp, in The Sunday Times, 27 April 2008 *Romanttinen vakoojatarina A review of Finnish translated Winter in Madrid, by Jari Olavi Hiltunen, in Opettaja 21 May 2010 *Dominion A review of Dominion, in Upcoming4.me 12 July 2013 *Reviews & excerpts of Winter in Madrid, Revelation and Dominion at BookBrowse 2008\u20132014 Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century British novelists Category:British mystery writers Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:British historical novelists Category:British male novelists Category:Writers from Edinburgh Category:Sidewise Award winners Category:Writers of historical mysteries Category:21st-century British male writers Category:Writers of historical fiction set in the early modern period ",
