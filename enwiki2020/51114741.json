    "text": "D.G., Party.San 2017 Mis\u00feyrming () are a black metal band from Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. The band formed in June 2013 and are currently signed to the French record label Norma Evangelium Diaboli. They released their debut studio album S\u00f6ngvar elds og \u00f3rei\u00f0u on 7 February 2015 to widespread critical acclaim. The band have since toured Europe and the United States, performed at Eistnaflug, and were named an 'artist in residence' at the famous Roadburn Festival in 2016. ==History== The band started as founding member D.G.'s solo project. T\u00f3mas \u00cdsdal, with whom he ran the V\u00e1nagandr record label, joined him. He eventually deferred his graduation date in favour of touring with the band, passing his final exams after being tutored by band-mate Helgi. Their debut studio album S\u00f6ngvar elds og \u00f3rei\u00f0u was released on 7 February 2015 to positive reviews from critics, being named one of the best metal albums of 2015 by Stereogum. Later that year the band performed in Brussels, Belgium at the Nidrosian Black Mass V festival. The band were one of three artists in residence at the famous Roadburn Festival in 2016. In a review of the band's show on April 14 for Invisible Oranges, described the band's performance as \"incredible\", writing that \"These new songs were a swirl of near dissonance, levied by \u201cblink and you\u2019ll miss it\u201d melodies that grounded the listener just long enough to kick the floor out from under them again. It was more head spinning than head banging.\" Later that year, Metal Hammer named them one of the 10 best Icelandic black metal bands. On January 10, 2017 the band released a split 10\" EP with fellow Icelandic band Sinmara, each band contributing one song; Mis\u00feyrming's song was titled \"Hof\" while Sinmara's was titled \"Ivory Stone\". The EP was released through Terratur Possessions. On April 27, 2019 the band announced their long-awaited sophomore album would be titled Algleymi and was released on May 24 through Norma Evangelium Diaboli.https://www.heaviestofart.com/blog/misthyrming-announce-new-album- algleymi According to D.G.; he wrote the music in 2015 after the release of the band's debut and started recording it in 2016 however due to production and mixing errors caused by cheap equipment the album was delayed and entirely rerecorded from scratch. The band continued touring in spite of this and even played some of the new songs in concents throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2017 after extensive rehearsal of the material the band secured a professional studio to record a new version of the album which was done between autumn 2017 and 2018 and featured guest vocals by Sturla Vi\u00f0ar of Svartidau\u00f0i and Wraath of Behexen, as well as the second lyrical contribution from poet and musician Krist\u00f3fer P\u00e1ll for one of the songs. Algleymi like its predecessor was very well received by fans and critics alike. The band also announced performances at Ascension Festival in their native Iceland and La Derni\u00e8re Messe in Switzerland on June as well as headlining a European tour in support of Algleymi with Terratur Possessions label mates Darvaza and French band Vortex of End.http://www.bardomethodology.com/articles/2019/05/22/misthyrming- interview/ The band continued touring and performing throughout 2019 and had various planned performances for 2020 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic they were forced to reschedule their slots at festivals as well as reschedule their Denmark and Germany mini-tour with fellow Iceland band Na\u00f0ra and abruptly ended their Eastern Europe tour, but not before the band live streamed their last show in Tallinn, Estonia on March 15, 2020, with the help of the venue's; \"Sveta Baar\" staff and their touring company Damn Loud. ==Discography== * S\u00f6ngvar elds og \u00f3rei\u00f0u (2015) * Ivory Stone / Hof (2017, split with Sinmara) * Algleymi (2019) ==Band members== * D.
