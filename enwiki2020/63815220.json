In business he is known mostly as co-owner and manager of Palomino & Vergara, a sherry brand popular in Spain and beyond between the 1930s and the 1960s; he also contributed to development of the x\u00e9r\u00e8s winegrowing business. Politically he supported the Traditionalist cause. In 1932 he was involved in Sanjurjada, a coup intended to topple the Republican government. In 1933\u20131936 he served as a Carlist deputy to the Cortes, while in 1968\u20131971 he was president of Junta Suprema Tradicionalista, the top Carlist executive structure. ==Family and youth== Jerez de la Frontera, early 20th c. Most authors when referring distant Palomino past point to a half-mythical knight Fern\u00e1n Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Palomino, who originated either from Cantabriasee e.g. Palomino entry, [in:] Bisabuelos service, available here, or Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible, New York 2015, , p. 458 or Navarre.Palomino entry, [in:] HeraldryInstitute service, available here He made his name during Reconquista,Palomino wine entry, [in:] WineSearcher service, available here distinguished himself in service of Alfonso X and settled in the area of Jerez de la Frontera in the 13th century.Becky Sue Epstein, Strong, Sweet and Dry: A Guide to Vermouth, Port, Sherry, Madeira and Marsala, London 2019, , p. 312. Some sources claim the Palominos might have been growing wine since the 10th century, referred after Julian Jeffs, Sherry, London 2019, , p. 48 A frequently repeated account holds that the Palominos have been since then busy with \"cultivo del vi\u00f1edo y crianza de vinos\"Francisco Quir\u00f3s Linares, Estudios de geograf\u00eda hist\u00f3rica e historia de la geograf\u00eda: obra escogida, Oviedo 2006, , p. 350 in the region, though documents confirm this starting the year of 1483.Jeffs 2019, p. 27 During the following four centuries the family got very branched and scattered throughout not only the province of C\u00e1diz, but also across most of Western Andalusia. None of the sources consulted provides information on what particular branch the ancestors of Juan Jos\u00e9 belonged to, apart that they have emerged as large landowners in Campi\u00f1a de Jerez and continued to grow wine. Close to nothing is known about the paternal grandfather, Pedro Palomino, apart that probably in the early 19th century he married Margarita L\u00f3pez\"Pedro Palomino\" entry, [in:] Geneanet service, available here and kept developing the family wine business.

A typical path for a young man from a well-off family would have been studying law, most likely in Seville, but there is no confirmation of Palomino graduating either in the early 1920s or at any other time. bodegas At unspecified time but prior to 1927in 1927 Palomino as a witness attended the wedding of her sister, El Guadalete 01.07.27, available here 1 Palomino married Isabel Vergara Sanchiz (1895-1977),\"Isabel Vergara Sanchiz\" entry, [in:] Geneanet service, available here a girl from Jerez and descendant to another wealthy winegrower family.she was daughter to Juan Mateo Vergara Quesada (1862-?) and Manuela Sanchiz Quesada (1867-?), both born and probably resident in Jerez de la Frontera, \"Juan Mateo Vergara Quesada\" entry, [in:] Geneanet service, available here It is possible that the marriage was part of a wider agreement, as at the time the two houses merged to create a joint Palomino & Vergara company. However, information related is confusing; some sources suggest that the Palominos and the Vergaras might have been running a joint business since the lateEspa\u00f1a Productora y Comercial 10.09.35, available here or even early 19th century.Antonio Mariscal Trujillo, Mudo testigo, [in:] Diario de Jerez 13.09.2000 The couple lived on family estate in Jerez de la Frontera and either owned or co-owned with other relatives the wine economy inherited. There is no information on their children and it appears that they were childless.no source mentions any of his children. His death notice lists a number of relatives, but not any descendants, compare Don Juan J. Palomino Jim\u00e9nez, [in:] Palomino & Vergara FB account 28.12.16, available here None of Palomino's relatives became a public figure.there was no family relationship between Juan Jos\u00e9 Palomino Jim\u00e9nez and \u00c1ngel Palomino Jim\u00e9nez, a writer popular in the late 20th century ==Early public engagements (before 1932)== Palomino with friends, early 1930s Little is known about political preferences of Palomino's ancestors; some information suggest they were related to Integrism. In the 1880s his father appeared in El Siglo Futuro as co-signatory of letters, protesting alleged mistreatment of the Catholics.El Siglo Futuro 14.02.82, available here The family of Palomino's in-laws, the Vergaras, were distantly related to the Nocedal family;Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Nocedal y Mayo married Maria Rufina Vergara Gordon; exact relationship of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Nocedal to the Integrist leader Ram\u00f3n Nocedal is not clear the Nocedals, the Vergaras and the Palominos maintained family relations.El Guadalete 02.08.32, available here However, there is no confirmed information of either the Palominos or the Vergaras as active in the movement. It is known that Juan Jos\u00e9 received a \u201cs\u00f3lida formaci\u00f3n tradicionalista\u201dJes\u00fas Evaristo Casariego, La verdad del Tradicionalismo: aportaciones espa\u00f1oles a la realidad de Europa, Madrid 1940, p. 137 and was very religious, when possible attending the mass every morning.Diario de Burgos 23.10.43, available here In the late 1910s and the early 1920s he was very active in Congregaci\u00f3n Marianista de San Luis Gonzaga,El Guadalete 23.01.17, available here a Catholic charity and educational institution. In 1919 he was noted in labors to contain the Spanish Flu pandemicEl Guadalete 29.01.19, available here and in 1920 he grew to membership in provincial executive of the organisation.El Guadalete 10.06.20, available here There is nothing known of Palomino's public activity in the early and mid-1920s, the final years of liberal Restoration regime and most of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. It is not known whether he joined the primoderiverista organizations, especially Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica and Somat\u00e9n. However, he was on at least correct terms with the local regime administration, as at unspecified time and in early 1928 latest he was nominated to the Jerez de la Frontera town hall, at the time its members not elected, but appointed by the provincial administration. As councilor he entered two committees: this of policia rural and this of instrucci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, asuntos jur\u00eddicos y c\u00e1rcel.El Guadalete 10.11.28, available here His membership in ayuntamiento was confirmed in the last voting of the monarchy; the local elections of April 1931, which ultimately brought about the fall of the monarchy, secured Palomino's renewed term in the town hall.El Guadalete 14.04.31, available here. Few months later but already under the Republican administration, in October 1931, Palomino received another official appointment; he member of Comit\u00e9 Paritario de Dependencias y Oficiales of Jerez de la Frontera, a labor arbitration committee. Palomino too his seat from the \"vocales propietarios efectivos\" pool, El Guadalete 30.10.31, available here office premises of Palomino & Vergara, Jerez de la Frontera Information on Palomino's political preferences of the very early 1930s is inconclusive. In October 1930 he was active in Partido Cat\u00f3lico Nacional, an Integrist organisation created after the fall of Primo; Palomino entered the local Junta Directiva and became its secretary, apparently on excellent terms with the party leader in Western Andalusia, Manuel Fal Conde.El Guadalete 14.10.30, available here However, in the local elections of 1931 he ran as \"gremialista\" against the republican-socialist coalitionEl Guadalete 30.04.31, available here and the following year he was still counted within \"minor\u00eda gremial\".El Guadalete 06.07.32, available here During the first Republican electoral campaign of June 1931 he co-financed the Jerez branch of Acci\u00f3n Nacional, a broad conservative alliance \u201cdominated by an energetic group of middle-class Integrists\u201d.Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931\u20131939, Cambridge 2008, , pp. 52\u201353 In the summer he co-signed a manifesto, which declared setting up of a \u201cpartido pol\u00edtico cat\u00f3lico\u201d within the general \u201ctradicionalismo-integrista\u201d current.others founders were Manuel Fal Conde, Gabriel Matute, Javier Vergara, Lucio Bascu\u00f1ana, Jes\u00fas Merello, Juan Cervera, Fernando Qui\u00f1ones and Francisco Contreras y V\u00edctor Cano, Manuel Ignacio Rey Soto, La derecha gaditana en la Segunda Rep\u00fablica (1931-1936) [MA thesis Universidad de Cadiz], Cadiz 2018, p. 80 In August he co-founded a local Jerez right-wing alliance Uni\u00f3n de Derechas Independientes and entered its ruling junta;El Guadalete 01.08.31, available here in early 1932 as member of Juventud of Derechas Independientes he invited Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera to Jerez and entertained him during a banquet.El Guadalate 01.03.32, available here Also in early 1932 he took part in a joint rightist conference in Jerez, attended by one of the Carlist national leaders Conde de Rodezno.El Guadalete 07.01.32, available here ==Sanjurjada and its aftermath (1932\u20131933)== Sanjurjo In the summer of 1932 some high army officers, perturbed by a series of Republican reforms targeting the military and outraged by contemptuous stand of Manuel Aza\u00f1a, decided to stage a coup and topple the Madrid government. In Andalusia the plot was headed by general Sanjurjo. It appears that in Jerez de la Frontera local conservative activists were involved in the conspiracy. At 8 PM on August 9, few hours prior to the agreed start of the rebellion, local Uni\u00f3n de Derechas Independientes leaders gathered during a one-hour meeting; Palomino was among them. The agenda remains unclear, but a historian suspects they were discussing logistics of the coup in Jerez.Joaqu\u00edn Gil Honduvilla, Los sucesos de Jerez de la Frontera en la sublevaci\u00f3n del 10 de agosto de 1932; el 28 tercio de la Guardia Civil, [in:] Revista de Historia Militar 121 (2017), p. 24 During the night the civilians involved who owned cars, including Palomino, used their machines to transport Guardia Civil members from county village posts to Jerez.Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 29 In the early morning hours of August 10 the same cars were used in a co-ordinated action of detaining local syndicalist and left-wing activists.Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 31 Once the local commanding officer Arturo Rold\u00e1n Tr\u00e1paga assumed power in Jerez, Palomino and other UDI leaders offered their services. Roldan declared no further aid was needed,Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 36 and called for a formal town hall meeting; he asked the concejales present to remain calm and go home.Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 37 The alcalde contacted the C\u00e1diz civil governor, who remained loyal to the government and demanded compliance. Alcalde then challenged Roldan, who \u2013 apparently bewildered - withdrew to the barracks. Early afternoon the mayor invited Palomino and councilors implicated for a meeting, locked them down and put under guard. In the evening they were transported to prison in C\u00e1diz.Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 40 In few hours also the rebellious Seville garrison surrendered; Jerez and Seville were the only cities where for brief time the insurgents took control. Palomino and other deportees during their stay in Villa de Cisneros In September Palomino and 161 inmates involved in the coup, soon to become known as Sanjurjada, were transported from C\u00e1diz to Villa de Cisneros, a Spanish military outpost in Africa.El Guadalete 22.09.32, available here Though technically under arrest, they were treated rather leniently; not restrained to their cells, they enjoyed fishing or taking long walks.Gil Honduvilla 2017, p. 44 Palomino emerged among informal leaders of the group, gaining respect due to \u201cserenidad de su juicio y la inflexibilidad de sus ideas\u201d.Casariego 1940, p. 137 He reportedly set up and led a local Carlist circle.the Carlist cell set up in Villa Cisneros was formally Junta Dependiente of the Andalucia Occidental party structures, Jos\u00e9 Luis Agud\u00edn Men\u00e9ndez, Una libertad para todos?

XXX/2, Sevilla 1979, p. 57 In 1935-1936 he was among relatively few CarlistsFerrer 1979, pp. 190-191 engaged in Bloque National, an alliance with the Alfonsinos.see e.g. Palomino\u2019s March 1935 labors in the Andalusian Bloque Nacional, El Guadalete 19.03.35, available here During the 1936 electoral campaign as the CT representative he co-engineered a local Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana alliance,El Guadalete 17.01.36, available here, Rey Soto 2018, p. 91 which eventually materialized as Candidatura Antirrevolucionaria;El Guadalete 16.02.36, available here during the violent campaign Diario de Jerez premises were burnt by left-wing mob and the daily ceased to issue.Juan Jos\u00e9 T\u00e9llez, Yanitos. Viaje al coraz\u00f3n de Gibraltar (1713-2013), Sevilla 2013, , p. 167 The campaign itself was ultimately a failure; Palomino lost to Frente Popular competitors and failed to get his Cortes ticket renewed.in the 1936 elections Palomino gathered 55,802, more than during his successful 1933 campaign, El Guadalete 18.02.36, available here Pre-war drill of Andalusian requet\u00e9 Palomino was intrinsically involved in Carlist anti-Republican conspiracy of 1936; details are unclear.Montejurra III/34 (1968), p. 4 Jerez was easily seized by the rebels and Andalusian Carlism enjoyed its days of triumph, but in late 1936 Palomino was scarcely noted for his party activity, recorded rather during religious services to the fallen requet\u00e9.La Uni\u00f3n 13.10.36, available here Though he did not form part of the nationwide Carlist executive Juna Nacional Carlista, he counted among members of the broad party command layer. He was present during the crucial Carlist meeting in Insua of February 1937, when regent-claimant and the movement leaders discussed the threat of forced amalgamation into a unificated state party. It is not clear whether Palomino sided with the tractable Rodeznistas or with the intransigent Falcondistas,Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, La continuidad ideol\u00f3gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 321 even though for years he remained a close acquaintance of Fal Conde. However, following the Unification Decree Palomino was not listed as member of the FET structures; quite to the opposite, following 1937 he entirely disappeared from politics. If present in the press, it was because of the winegrowing business he kept advertising;in early 1937 Palomino published adverts mostly in Pensamiento Alaves, since September 1937 mostly in Imperio; since early 1938 they appeared in numerous titles indeed, it seems that during the following decades Palomino dedicated his time to commercial activities. ==Palomino and Vergara== P&V; bodega, Jerez As the marriage of Juan Jos\u00e9 Palomino and Isabel Vergara was parallel to merger of Palomino and Vergara winegrowing businesses, he was possibly expected to take over the joint enterprise.

It is not known that political flavor spelled trouble to Palomino\u2019s business during the Republic, but it did translate into problems during Francoism later; censors suspected that the marketing slogan \u201cla hora del cambio\u201d, which accompanied the advertising campaing of the Fabuloso brandy, contained a veiled political message, Enrique Becerra, El vino de Jerez y Sanl\u00facar, s.l. 2017, , page unavailable, see here In the mid-1940s Palomino attempted a dynamic expansion on the Spanish market. As he lacked funds, he intended to transform the company from family business to a joint-stock public limited company, the first of this kind among the Jerez wine enterprises.Hoja Oficial de Lunes 06.10.47, available here In 1947 he set up a Madrid-based Palomino SA, which controlled Palomino & Vergara.ABC 21.10.47, available here He was also opening branches across the country, with regional offices in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao, Oviedo, Palma, Santander, Logro\u00f1o, Burgos and Zaragoza.Diario de Burgos 23.10.47, available here At that time P&V; offered a wide range of products, principally brandy (Tres Racimos,La Prensa 15.08.31, available here Vencedor, Centurion,the brandy \u201cRequet\u00e9 vencedor\u201d was later re-named to \u201cCenturion\u201d, Cesar Alcal\u00e1, M\u00e1s sobre vinos y licores, [in:] ALasCatacumbas blog 14.02.08, [link blocked by Wikipedia] Eminencia) and various types of sherry: cortado (Buler\u00eda), fino (T\u00edo Mateo),Tio Mateo was positioned as a competitor to T\u00edo Pepe, heavily marketed as \u201cLo \u00fanico que no han podido destruir los rojos\u201d oloroso (Los Flamencos)Hoja Oficial de Lunes 28.05.62, available here and amontillado (John Peter).Rafael Gines de Segundo, [in:] Palomino & Vergara Jerez FB profile 21.10.13, available here The company produced also anisette (La Jerezana)ABC 22.01.46, available here ponche (Carlista)Cesar Alcal\u00e1, M\u00e1s sobre vinos y licores, [in:] ALasCatacumbas blog 14.02.08, [link blocked by Wikipedia] and gin (Palomino).Rafael Gines de Segundo, [in:] Palomino & Vergara Jerez FB profile 22.10.13, available here Its large Jerez bodega complex, known as \u201c12 disciples\u201d, was plugged into the railway network by means of own dedicated siding.now the building serves as a post office, see GoogleMaps service, available here ponche \"Carlista\" The history of Palomino & Vergara in the 1950s is somewhat unclear.

None of historiographic works dealing with Carlism of the so-called primer franquismo mentions his name;there is no historiographic work dedicated to Spanish Carlism of the early Francoism, though there is one focusing on the Navarrese Carlism. There are a few studies covering Carlism of mid- and late Francoism which in introductory chapters treat the 1940s and the 1950s; none mentions Palomino as active throughout this period, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias.

Palomino travelled also to Britain, probably on business. In 1946 he visited London and witnessed the House of Commons proceedings. When asked for comparison between the Commons and the Cortes, he responded that \u201caqu\u00ed hablan, y nosotros declamamos; aqu\u00ed discuten, y nosotros disputamos\u201d, La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola 14.04.46, available here However, Palomino at least maintained correspondence with party heavyweights. When in 1956-1958 the official Carlism turned a corner and changed its non-collaboration stand versus Francoism to cautious rapprochement, Palomino was on good terms with leaders of both currents, the departing leader Manual Falin a 1957 letter to Palomino Fal Conde criticised the collaborationist wave in the party, Mercedes V\u00e1zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi\u00f3n. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 47 and the new one Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Valiente.in a 1958 letter to Palomino Valiente discussed would-be action to be taken against the so-called \u201cEstorilos\u201d, a group of Traditionalists who declared Don Juan the legitimate heir, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 65 It is known that at the moment of takeover in 1957 Palomino was a \u201cjefe regional de Sevilla\u201d, which probably stands for leadership in Western Andalusia; Valiente intended to nominate him the head for entire Andalusia, which generated some dissent in the local Granada jeafatura.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 50 The idea was probably abandoned, as in 1962 Palomino was still noted as the CT leader in Andalusia Occidental.Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 81. One source claims that in February 1962 Palomino was among the dismissed \u201cviejos jefes provinciales\u201d, which suggests that until that point he double-hatted as a provincial jefe, though it is not clear which province (Sevilla? Cadiz?) was in question, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 160 Palomino was noted mostly for ceremonial roles in the party, e.g. in the late 1950s he entertained the Carlist infante Don Carlos Hugoin 1959 Palomino, Barrau, Mu\u00f1oz Chapuli and others hosted Don Carlos Hugo, Javier Lavard\u00edn, Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de Espa\u00f1a, Paris 1976, p. 78 or in the early 1960s he played host to infanta Mar\u00eda de las Nieves during their tours to Seville and around.Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La soluci\u00f3n federal para Espa\u00f1a que Franco rechaz\u00f3, Madrid 2014, , p. 142 It started to change with mid-decade approaching; in 1963 he co-signed \u201cEl Carlismo y la unidad cat\u00f3lica\u201d, an official party document which voiced against the perspective of introducing religious liberty in Spain.Palomino signes as jefe of Andalucia Occidental (the Andalucia Oriental jefe was Julio Mu\u00f1oz Chapuli), Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 150 One year earlier he was nominated to a 6-member Comisi\u00f3n Especial de Estudios Econ\u00f3micos, a party body entrusted with sanating the ailing CT budget, always in dramatic shortage of cash.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 178 The appointment was related to his image of a successful businessman, \u201chombre de impresa\u201d active in various chambers of commerce and capable of pulling many strings.Montejurra III/34 (1968), p. 4 However, it seems that at this role he did not meet expectations; in 1964 Palomino was noted struggling to sort things out.in 1964 Palomino kept corresponding with local jefes on financial issues, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 234 In 1965 he was eventually appointed the carlist jefe in all of Andalusia;Montejurra I/7 (1965), p. 4; Montejurra I/12 (1965), p. 20. However, in 1966 the same source referred to Palomino as the leader for Andalucia Occidental, Montejurra II/13 (1966), p. 4 his public activity was about opening new party c\u00edrculos or presiding over grand requet\u00e9 ex-combatant rallies.Montejurra I/7 (1965), p. 4, Montejurra I/12 (1965), p. 20 Carlist rally near Madrid, mid-1960s Until the mid-1960s Palomino was not noted for any role in decision-making process within the party. At the time it was increasingly divided between the Traditionalists and the new breed of militants grouped around Don Carlos Hugo, who pursued an increasingly heterodox agenda. It is not clear whether Palomino engaged in rivalry between the two factions, though his unswerving loyalty to the dynasty, shared with his close friend Fal,a monographic booklet refers to Palomino as to a \u201cclose friend\u201d of Fal Conde, Ana Mar\u00edn Fidaldo, Manuel M. Burgue\u00f1o, In memoriam. Manuel J. Fal Conde (1894-1975), Sevilla 1980, p. 57 rendered him a potential ally of the Huguistas. When in 1965 they enforced major shakeup in party executive strucutes,Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sentis Simeon was dismissed as president of Secretaria General and the entire body was dissolved. It was replaced with Secretar\u00eda T\u00e9cnica de la Junta de Gobierno by some dubbed \u201cinternal coup within Carlism\u201d,Rod\u00f3n Guinjoan 2015, pp. 280-281, Lavardin 1976, pp. 251-252 Palomino found himself promoted; he entered Junta de Gobierno, a new collegial body auxiliary to the party jefe Valiente.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, pp. 250-251. However, when in 1966 a new body, the 35-member Consejo Asesor de la Jefatura was set up, Palomino was not nominated, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 99-100 In 1966 CT introduced a new command layer, \u201cdelgaciones regias\u201d, with Spain divided into 5 zones;the entities in question were Catalonia, Vascongadas & Navarra, Le\u00f3n, Dos Castillas, and the South, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 101 Palomino was nominated head of \u201cSouth of Spain\u201d.\u201cthe South of Spain\u201d unit consisted of Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia, the Canarias, Ceuta and Melilla, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 275 ==Carlist: elevation to leadership (1967\u20131968)== Valiente (earlier photo) In 1967 the Huguistas were almost fully in control of the party; the last obstacle to total domination was the movement leader Valiente, eventually manoeuvred into dismissal later this year.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, pp. 333-337 The vacated post of Jefe Delegado was not filled and Junta de Gobierno was dissolved;Junta de Gobierno was formed by Palomino and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Valiente, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala, Jos\u00e9 Puig Pellicer, Ricardo Ruiz de Gauna y Lascura\u00edn, Manuel Piorno Mart\u00edn de los R\u00edos, Montejurra III/30 (1967), p. 16 a new collegial executive Junta Suprema Tradicionalista was set up, and the king- claimant Don Javier nominated Palomino its president,exact mechanism of Palomino\u2019s elevation is not clear. None of the sources consulted advances any theory as to why he and not any other militant was appointed to head the organisation. It is known, however, that at the time he was viewed within the party as an affluent businessman, and Huguistas used to turn to him for help as to sorting out the party financial problems, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 305 nominally the highest political position in the movement.Miralles Climent 2015, p. 67. Some authors claim that Palomino was nominated \"jefe delegado\", information not confirmed elsewhere, see e.g. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Clemente, Seis estudios sobre el carlismo, Madrid 1999, , p. 23 However, as the Junta rarely met, real power rested with Secretar\u00eda General,Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 129 which controlled all communication with regional jefaturas.the head of Secretaria and the person who enjoyed most administrative power in the Comuni\u00f3n structures was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala, Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 114 In terms of internal power struggle, Palomino is currently considered a representative of the Carlist \u201cold wave\u201d, people whose elevation gave comfort to the Traditionalists, but who were ready to accept the new trends.among \u201chombres de la \u2018vieja ola\u2019 que dar\u00edan tranquilidad a los tradicionalistas, pero aceptaban la renovaci\u00f3n\u201d, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 300. This opinion is not shared unanimously. Another scholar maintains that Palomino was a \u201creprezentant \u2018nov\u00e9ho karlismu\u2019\u201d, Chalupa 2008, p. 256 The new setup was worked out in final months of 1967, but was made public in early 1968.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, pp. 333-337 Rally at the summit of Montejurra, late 1960s At that time Carlist leaders were still hoping that collaborationist stand towards Francoism might eventually bring the dynasty somewhat closer to the throne. In public statements Palomino confirmed this policy to the full; he declared that Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista would act within the legal framework, which allows some competition of ideas united by the \u201cspirit of 18 July\u201d, and would work towards the crowning of their claimants.in a lengthy 1967 interview and still merely \u201cdelegato regional de la Zona Sur de Espa\u00f1a\u201d, Palomino laid out his vision of the Spanish politics of the time. He claimed that \"el general Sanjurjo deseaba una coordinaci\u00f3n del Ej\u00e9rcito con el pueblo. Por la parte de \u00e9ste se fund\u00f3 el Requet\u00e9 y el 18 de julio\", that \"nuestros postulados e ideales est\u00e1n perfectamente interpretados en los Principios Fundamentales de 1958. Esa monarqu\u00eda popular, social, cat\u00f3lica y representativa que propugnan es un ideal puramente carlista\", and that \"actuamos dentro de la legalidad, naturalmente, pero con todas las posibilidades. Nuestras concentraciones de Montejurra, Cerro de los Angeles, etc., lo demuestran. Nuestra actitud, por otra parte, queda reflejada en el telegrama enviado por don Javier de Borb\u00f3n Parma al Jefe del Estado, felicit\u00e1ndole por el avance que la Ley Org\u00e1nica supone para la realidad pol\u00edtica y social de Espa\u00f1a\". He noted that \"Decreto [de unificaci\u00f3n] es de 1937 y ten\u00eda un fin limitado. Era para el momento de la guerra. Concluida \u00e9sta no quer\u00edamos que la unificaci\u00f3n derivase en un partido fascista. Manifestamos nuestra disconformidad y nos quedamos quietos. Hoy el Movimiento admite una ordenada concurrencia de criterios, y en eso estamos\" \"tenemos las ideas b\u00e1sicas de la monarqu\u00eda tradicional espa\u00f1ola. Hay una dinast\u00eda espa\u00f1ol\u00edsima que representa don Javier de Borb\u00f3n Parma y su hijo don Carlos-Hugo. Est\u00e1n perfectamente preparados para reinar, y no como nuevos \u00abamadeos\u00bb.\" As to the Carlists themselves, Palomino declared that \"no somos retr\u00f3grados ni reaccionarios, aunque sea \u00e9ste el sambenito que se nos cuelga\" and that \"en l\u00edneas generales, hay cosas que se pueden reformar y mejorar por cauces legales y pac\u00edficos\", Montejurra II/24 (1967) p. 9 Careful not to breach the limits of loyalty to the regime he carefully hinted about a need for \u201creconstrucci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de nuestro tiempo\u201d and claimed 500,000 Carlist affiliates in 7,000 c\u00edrculos;when officially taking over in February 1968, Palomino declared continuation of Valiente\u2019s policy. However, some of his phrases were ambiguous. On the one hand, he admitted \u201cel mismo ep\u00edritu que os llam\u00f3 al 18 de julio\u201d, on the other he utteres some phrases about the need to rejuvenate: \u201cformamos y promocionamos a la juventud, nos integramos en la sociedad para ser levadura de una monarqu\u00eda popular, dialogamos con todos y queremos participar en la construcci\u00f3n del futuro Montejurra III/34 (1968) p. 4 he also stressed that animosity between the Falangists and the Carlists was a thing of the past.Rod\u00f3n Guinjoan 2015, pp. 403-404 However, while Palomino declared no major change to general concilliatory policy of the movement, the Huguistas were already bent on \u201clinea de dura oposici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica al R\u00e9gimen\u201d.Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 114 Already in early 1967 Palomino was in presidency of major Carlist rallies like the traditional Montejurra gathering;Montejurra III/26 (1967) in 1968 he presided over the MontserratMontejurra IV/38 (1968), p. 14 rally and the Montejurra ascent. It is not clear whether - aged 72 - he climbed the summit, but he played key role during ceremonies on the foothills in the Irache monastery and in Estella.Montejurra IV/37 (1968), p. 19, also Miralles Climent 2015, p. 107 In the summer of 1968 he entertained the infant Don Carlos Hugo and his wife Do\u00f1a Irene on their tour across southern SpainMontejurra IV/39-40 (1968), p. 11 and in November that year he hosted infanta Maria Teresa in Cadiz and around.Montejurra IV/43 (1968), p. 21 Palomino started to feature in Huguista propaganda prints, like the Montejurra review; he was presented as a leader utterly loyal to the dynasty who was first to support all royal initiatives, e.g. opened bank accounts for charity initiative of princess Irene.in 1968 Palomino opened bank accounts for Fondo Ni\u00f1os Biafra in response to the call from Princess Irene, Montejurra IV/42 (1968), p. 14 It is not clear whether he double-hatted as the Andalusian regional jefe.in 1967 he was still referred to as such, Montejurra III/25 (1967), p. 27 ==Carlist: leader of figurehead (1968\u20131971)== Princess Irene and Don Carlos Hugo Don Carlos Hugo and the Huguistas were adopting an increasingly challenging stand towards Francoism; the process climaxed when the prince and most of his family were expelled from Spain in late 1968. Palomino presided over the urgently convened sitting of Junta Suprema, which was raided and broken by the police. The later Junta declaration protested the expulsions and maintained that Carlism would never bend to \"any group of interest\", which probably stood for supporters of Don Juan Carlos. In return, official press published an open letter from a group of requet\u00e9 ex-combatants aligned with the Juanista claim, who declared that \"negamos a esa Junta el derecho a hablar en nombre del Carlismo\".Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 239 Opposition to Palomino-led jefatura originated also in Carlist circles unrelated to Juanismo and Don Juan Carlos. The traditionalists were increasingly alarmed by progressist, left-wing course adopted by the movement leaders; already in 1968 Palomino started to receive letters protesting implementation of new proto-socialist threads and demanding that he cracks down on subversive currents.e.g. in 1968 one of the correspondents asked that: \u201cpido que el Excmo. Sr. Presidente de la Junta Suprema de la Comuni\u00f3n haga una declaraci\u00f3n tajante de la vigencia de nuestro sagrado lema, sin concesiones al error, en la seguridad de que ella servir\u00e1, no s\u00f3lo para unir a todas nuestras fracciones dispersas, sino tambi\u00e9n a una inmensa mayor\u00eda de espa\u00f1oles que, sin ellos saberlo, piensan como nosotros y que est\u00e1n ansiosos de una pol\u00edtica firme, recta y clara exenta de todo liberalismo\u201d, Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 115 Among many voices of dismayGarc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 89 the one which gained particular popularity was this of Jes\u00fas Evaristo Casariego. In 1970 he first addressed Palomino with an alarming letter,Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 83 and upon receiving no response he published a pamphlet Interpelaci\u00f3n a la Junta Suprema de la Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista: \u00bfA d\u00f3nde se quiere llevar al Carlismo?, which lambasted some official statements of CT leaders as downright scandalous.Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 277, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 137 It is not exactly clear what the position of Palomino was and whether \u2013 already in his mid-70s \u2013 he realized the nature of struggle going on within the movement. Most information available points to his mostly ceremonial appearances, like presidency over homages to Carlist martyrse.g. in 1969 Palomino as president of Junta Suprema presided over homages to Antonio Molle Lazo, Montejurra IV/47 (1969), pp. 27, 29 or over ex-combatant Quintillo rallies, e.g. in 1969Montejurra IV/46 (1969), pp. 8-9 or 1970.Montejurra V/52 (1970), p. 6 Some scholars count him among promoters of the new left-wing course,one historian claims that the new, progressist Carlist policy was \u201cimpulsada por Carlos Hugo, Zavala y Palomino\u201d, Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 115; another scholar considers him \u201creprezentant \u2018nov\u00e9ho karlismu\u2019\u201d, Chalupa 2008, p. 256 others assume he was merely acquiescent or disoriented.V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 300 The only clear guideline he followed was total loyalty to the claimant, who also declared full trust in Palomino; when the latter hinted about inefficiency of the Junta,Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 130 Don Javier responded that nomination of a new Jefe Delegado was inopportune and that Palomino and the Junta enjoyed absolute confidence.Montejurra IV/46 (1969), p. 21 In late 1970 the Huguistas decided to complete their takover of Carlism by transforming the movement into a mass party of the Left. The change was consumed at Congreso de Pueblo Carlista, staged in France; it is not clear whether Palomino attended. At unclear date between May 1971 and July 1971 he was dismissed from presidency of Junta Suprema, though he remained its member.in the spring of 1971 Palomino was referred in the Carlist press as merely \u201cMiembro de la Junta Suprema y Delegado Regio de la Zona Sur\u201d; the president of Junta Suprema was Jos\u00e9 Puig Pellicer, jefe of Andalucia Occidental was Guillermo Garc\u00eda Pascual, and Andalucia Oriental was headed by Antonio Pe\u00f1a Su\u00e1rez, Rod\u00f3n Guinjoan 2015, pp. 510-511. According to one scholar Palomino was dismissed as president on July 27, 1971, Jacek Bartyzel, Kr\u00f3lowie i przyw\u00f3dcy karlistowscy, [in:] Legitymizm service, available here, the same date is given in Ferm\u00edn P\u00e9rez-Nievas Borderas, Contra viento y marea. Historia de la evoluci\u00f3n ideol\u00f3gica del carlismo a trav\u00e9s de dos siglos de lucha, Pamplona 1999, , p. 176 The official reason quoted was \u201cfailure to sort out economic issues entrusted to him\u201d.Robert Vallverd\u00fa i Mart\u00ed, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal\u00e0: del \"D\u00e9u, P\u00e0tria i Rei\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Barcelona 2014, , p. 224. Indeed, in late 1970 Palomino was nominated to Comisi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica of CT, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 129 In September Junta Suprema was dissolved and replaced by Junta de Gobierno; Palomino was not appointed its member.Vallverd\u00fa i Mart\u00ed 2014, p. 224 Later this year and in the atmosphere of all-out war between the traditionalists and the progressists, he lost also his seat in executive of the ex-combatant organisation.in May 1971 Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Acci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica y Participaci\u00f3n, an offshoot Carlist organisation pitted against the Huguistas, demanded that Junta de la Hermandad Nacional de Antiguos Combatientes de Tercios de Requet\u00e9s dismiss its president Ignacio Romero Osborne (Marq\u00faes de Marchelina), Palomino and some other members, charged with violating Traditionalist principles, Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 312. Romero refused to step down. Police intervened and raided official premises of the Hermandad, which were then taken over by the rebels. Romero formed in France the new Junta of the Hermandad, but Palomino was not listed as its member, Garc\u00eda Riol 2015, p. 317, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 338 Following this episode there is no further information on Palomino's public or Carlist activity. ==See also== * Carlism * Traditionalism (Spain) ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Francisco Bernal Garc\u00eda, El lobby del Jerez.
