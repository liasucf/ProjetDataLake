    "text": "This runestone is designated as U 871 in the Rundata catalog and is originally from \u00d6lsta, a village in the county of Uppland in Sweden. ==Description== It is believed that this stone remained in its original place until 1896. The spot was close to the Eriksgata, the road that the king travelled after having been elected at the Stone of Mora, in order to be accepted by his subjects. The stone was sold for 50 Swedish kronor in 1896 to the founder of Skansen, Artur Hazelius, where it was moved. It remains at Skansen to this day. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The inscription is signed by the runemaster \u00c5smund K\u00e5resson, who was active during the first half of the eleventh century in Uppland. Over twenty other inscriptions are listed in Rundata as being signed by \u00c5smund including U 301 in Sk\u00e5nela, the now-lost U 346 in Fr\u00f6sunda, U 356 in \u00c4ngby, the now-lost U 368 in Helg\u00e5by, U 824 in Holm, U 847 in V\u00e4ster\u00e5ker, U 859 in M\u00e5sta, U 884 in Ingla, U 932 at Uppsala Cathedral, U 956 in Vedyxa, U 969 in Bolsta, the now-lost U 986 in Kungsg\u00e5rden, U 998 in Sk\u00e4ller\u00f6, U 1142 in \u00c5byggeby, U 1144 in Tierp, U 1149 in Fler\u00e4ng, U Fv1986;84 in Bo g\u00e5rd, U Fv1988;241 in Rosersberg, Gs 11 in J\u00e4rvsta, Gs 12 in Lund, and Gs 13 in S\u00f6derby. \u00c5smund signed with the statement en Asmundr hio or \"and \u00c1smundr cut,\" words that he also used on U 969. In 1991, the Swedish Rune authority had the stone colorized as an experiment to see how well it protects the stone from moss and the weather. It is believed that the colorization of the stone will protect this stone for at least 50 years to come. ==Transliteration of runic text into Latin letters== :binrn ' au\u00feulfr ' (k)unor ' hulmtis ' ---u ri-o stin \u00feino ' ifti\u0280 ' ulf ' kinlauha\u0280 buanta ' in osmuntr hiu == Gallery == Image:Upplands Runinskrift 871 2.jpg|Detail from the U 871 runestone. ==References== ==External links== *Photograph of U 871 in 1991 - Swedish National Heritage Board Uppland Runic Inscription 0871 ",
