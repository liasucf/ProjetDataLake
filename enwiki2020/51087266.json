According to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), investigators found a list of possible targets in an appointment folder of the soldier, Kahane among them. They also found notes of a planned travel route: Franco Albrecht wanted to drive with his motorcycle from his hometown Offenbach am Main to Berlin. An accomplice should have brought him a shotgun. Albrecht also had photographs of cars belonging to members of the Berlin bureau of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung and was witnessed practicing with a sniper rifle. Prosecutors interprete these hints as a plan to kill Anetta Kahane. == Publications == * Ich durfte, die anderen mussten.
