    "text": "\"Rock and Roll Music\" is a song written and recorded by rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry. It has been widely covered and is recognized as one of Berry's most popular and enduring compositions. \"Rock and Roll Music\" was a record chart hit for Berry, reaching the top 10 in the United States. The Beatles' 1964 recording topped singles charts in Europe and in Australia, and the Beach Boys had a U.S. top 10 hit with the song in 1976. == Original song == The sessions for \"Rock and Roll Music\" took place in May 1957 in Chicago. The session was produced by Leonard Chess and Phil Chess. Backing Berry were Lafayette Leake (piano), Willie Dixon (bass), and Fred Below (drums). Chess records issued the song as a single in September 1957 on both the 45 and 78 rpm formats. It reached number six on Billboard magazine's R&B; Singles chart and number eight on Hot 100 chart before the year's end. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Berry's version number 128 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The song is also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". == The Beatles version == The Beatles performed the song in many of their early Hamburg shows, and also played it on the BBC program Pop Go The Beatles. In late 1964, exhausted from non-stop touring and recording and short of original material, they decided to record several of their old rock and rhythm and blues favorites to fill out their LP release Beatles for Sale. John Lennon provided the vocal. In contrast to Berry's even-toned rendition, Lennon sang it as loudly and dynamically as his voice would permit. In the U.S., it was released on the LP Beatles '65. The song was part of the set list for the group's final tour in 1966; the performance from their show of June 30 at the Nippon Budokan was included in 1996's Anthology 2and was also performed during the Get Back/Let It Be Sessions in January 1969. It also served as the title song to the Beatles' 1976 compilation album Rock 'n' Roll Music. Credits for the piano vary. The original Beatles for Sale liner notes, by Derek Taylor, state that \"George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano\", implying an overdub by all three that was added after the basic take. In the 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Mark Lewisohn described the recording as a single take with no overdubs, with \"all The Beatles on their familiar instruments\" and Martin on piano. In some countries, \"Rock and Roll Music\" was released as a single, with \"I'm a Loser\" as the B-side, in early 1965. It topped the charts in Norway, Sweden and Australia. The single peaked at number two in Germany and the Netherlands, and number three in Belgium. == The Beach Boys version == The Beach Boys' version includes the use of backing vocals which repeat the phrase \"Rock, roll, rockin' and roll\". There is a difference between the LP version and the single version in that the single version has more synthesizer. Their version reached No. 5 on the US chart and No. 11 in Canada during the summer of 1976. === Charts === Weekly charts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1976) !Peak position |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|36 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990 \u2013 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|11 |} Year-end charts {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1976) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|112 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|81 |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:1957 songs Category:1965 singles Category:1976 singles Category:Chuck Berry songs Category:Bill Haley songs Category:Emerson, Lake & Palmer songs Category:Humble Pie (band) songs Category:Jan and Dean songs Category:Mental As Anything songs Category:REO Speedwagon songs Category:The Beach Boys songs Category:The Beatles songs Category:Chess Records singles Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Number-one singles in Norway Category:Parlophone singles Category:Reprise Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by George Martin Category:Songs about music Category:Songs written by Chuck Berry Category:Songs written by Brian Wilson ",
