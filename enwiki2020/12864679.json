    "text": "Femoxetine (INN; tentative brand name Malexil; developmental code name FG-4963) is a drug related to paroxetine that was being developed as an antidepressant by Danish pharmaceutical company Ferrosan in 1975 before acquisition by Novo Nordisk. It acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Development was halted to focus attention on paroxetine instead, given femoxetine's inability to be administered as a daily pill. Both femoxetine and paroxetine were invented in the 1970s by Jorgen Buus-Lassen (J\u00f8rgen Anders Christensen name on the patents though). Jorgen Buus-Lassen's name is on the pharmacology paper, however. After Ferrosan's acquisition, femoxetine died from neglect. ==Analogs== #Addition of the para-fluoro atom results in a different compound that is a hybrid of femoxetine & paroxetine named FG 7080, which has a separate patent. According to the patent tables, incorporation of the fluorine atom potentiated the 5-HT affinity considerably. #Pfizer made some similar analogs in . E.g. a Viloxazine type of catechol ether is used, but 4-phenyl instead of based on a morpholine ring. ==See also== * Alaproclate * Indalpine * Zimelidine ==References== Category:Antidepressants Category:Muscarinic antagonists Category:Phenol ethers Category:Piperidines Category:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ",
