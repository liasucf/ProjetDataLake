    "text": "WrestleMania is WWE's biggest pay-per-view event. In 2019, the 35th edition took place at MetLife Stadium and attracted 82,265 spectators. This is a list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events, detailing all professional wrestling cards promoted on pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network by WWE. WWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original brand extension in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its Raw and SmackDown television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special ECW PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an ECW brand in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands. In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in high-definition. The company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of US$9.99 monthly as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, WCW, and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from NXT Arrival onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition. After the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after WrestleMania 34. In addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by In Demand. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) Vu!, Shaw PPV, or SaskTel PPV, and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the Cineplex Entertainment chain, a practice dating to the Famous Players ownership by Viacom. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on Main Event. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs were shown on Sky Sports Box Office until 2019, when BT Sport took over rights to WWE content. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently Sony TEN) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming, including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge. Currently, WWE PPV events are typically 3 hours in length, with the exception of the \"Big Four\" events which range from 4 to 4\u00bd hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length. WWE airs a pre-show before most Network events known as the Kickoff show. Each Kickoff show includes matches, interviews, and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The Kickoff pre-show began as a 30-minute show before expanding to 1 hour, beginning with Night of Champions in September 2014. The \"Big Four\" Kickoff shows are the longest, at 2 hours. WWE occasionally airs a post-show after some Network events. Originally known as Fallout, and later known as Raw Talk and Talking Smack during the brand-only events, each post- show includes interviews and a panel of experts analyzing the event. The post- shows vary in length. The NXT TakeOver events began at 2 hours in length before expanding to 2\u00bd hours, beginning with TakeOver: Brooklyn in 2015, and sometimes 3 hours, beginning with TakeOver: New Orleans in 2018. Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The TakeOver pre-shows are typically 30 minutes in length while some have been 1 hour, beginning with TakeOver: San Antonio in 2017. WWE also occasionally aired a post-show after TakeOver events known as TakeOver Fallout. Each TakeOver Fallout included interviews and a panel of experts analyzing the event. The Fallout post-shows varied in length. == Past events== ===1980s=== ====1985==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! scope=\"col\" width=\"10\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" width=\"490\"| Final match |- |March 31 |WrestleMania |Madison Square Garden |New York, New York |Hulk Hogan and Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff in a tag team match |- |November 7 |The Wrestling Classic |Rosemont Horizon |Rosemont, Illinois |Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage in the Wrestling Classic tournament final |} ====1986==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" ! scope=\"col\" width=\"10\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"| Event ! scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"| Venue ! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"| Location ! scope=\"col\" width=\"490\"| Final match ! scope=\"col\" width=\"160\"| Notes |- |rowspan=\"3\"|April 7 |rowspan=\"3\"|WrestleMania 2 |Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum |Uniondale, New York |Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper in a 10-round boxing match |rowspan=\"3\"|This aired as one event, but was staged at three locations.
