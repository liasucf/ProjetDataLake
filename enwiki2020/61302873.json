He served as a teacher in Grade\u0161nica. Later, he joined the armed group of Cretan G. Volanis, where he was distinguished for his leadership abilities. He also collaborated with G. Dikonomos Makris. In May 1906 he formed his own armed group that acted in Mariovo against the Bulgarian komitadjis and Ottoman military detachments, cooperating with the chieftain Simos Ioannidis.\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u039f \u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 1904-1908, publications \u0397\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, Thessaloniki, 1999, p. 291 - 349 Later, he collaborated with Georgios Tsontos, acting in southern Mariovo and in the region of Florina and Prespa. At the end of May 1907, due to the departure of Tsontos and a number of chieftains towards Korestia, Christou, with his group, united with the group of G. Proimos, acting in all the areas of Prespa, Florina and southern Mariovo and Pelister. Then he moved south to Verno, where he cooperated with the chieftains I. Karavitis, Pavlos Rakovitis, S. Kleidis and P. Gerogiannis. In April 1907, along with the groups of chieftains Pavlos Nikolaidis, G. Tsontos and I. Karavitis, attacked komitadjis in Florina. Many young local people rushed then to be ranked among the armed groups of those chieftains. At the end of 1907 he took over the defense in the area of the villages of Kabasnitsa (now Proti) and Kladorrachi of Florina. In May 1908, after a clash with an Ottoman army detachment, southwest of Monastir (now Bitola), he escaped to Bukovo, where he was finally arrested. He was hanged on June 21, 1908, in Monastir, as a retaliation for the assassination of Deputy Governor Zeinel Bey of Nymfaio. In 1960 a bust was erected on a central street in Florina to honor him.\u039f \u03b5\u03bc\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \u0395\u03ba\u03b5\u03af \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc, \u0399\u03cc\u03c2, \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03af\u03b1, 26 November 2000 == References == Category:1887 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Greek people of the Macedonian Struggle Category:Greek Macedonians Category:People from Bitola Municipality Category:Macedonian revolutionaries (Greek) Category:Executed Greek people Category:People executed by the Ottoman Empire by hanging Category:20th-century executions by the Ottoman Empire ",
