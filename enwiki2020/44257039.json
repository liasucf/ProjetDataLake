    "text": "Ruahine \"Roni\" Albert is New Zealand anti-domestic violence activist of Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto, Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa and Tainui descent. Albert was co-founder (with Ariana Simpson) of Te Whakaruruhau in Hamilton, the first M\u0101ori Women's Refuge, in 1987. Still active with Te Whakaruruhau, Albert also has had roles with Child, Youth and Family, Work and Income and Housing New Zealand. Now a multi-site refuge, Te Whakaruruhau operates a wh\u0101nau facility which works closely with the Te Ao Marama Unit at Waikeria Prison and focuses on reintegration of offenders and reduction of reoffending. The wh\u0101nau facility was opened by MP Tariana Turia. In 2000, Albert and national Women's Refuge head, Merepeka Raukawa-Tait clashed with M\u0101ori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia over the perceived down-playing of domestic violence in the M\u0101ori community. Albert was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for services to M\u0101ori and the community in the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Waikato Category:New Zealand activists Category:New Zealand women activists Category:Anti-domestic violence activists Category:Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa Category:Waikato Tainui Category:Recipients of the Queen's Service Medal Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:New Zealand justices of the peace ",
