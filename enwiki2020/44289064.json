    "text": "Connexion is an Indian Tamil-language celebrity game show on STAR Vijay. The game is played by three teams \u2013 each team has one celebrity and the other person could be their friend or family. It is a team game and consists of four rounds. Before the actual games start, they have a warm up round known as Javvu Mittai. In this, Jagan starts off with some random word. Each team should say a connecting word, i.e., if team A says a word connecting to the one told by Jegan, then team B should say a word connecting to what was told by team C. This is continued until each team had a few chances. However, this is not included for points. ==Gameplay format== ===Round 1: two by two=== In this round, two pictures are shown. The team has 30 seconds to guess common word/homonym from the pictures. The words sound the same but can have different spellings or have slight variations in how they are pronounced. Each team has to answer three questions in this round. If any team is unable to answer in the given time, other teams are given a chance to answer. Bonus points are also rewarded... ===Round 2: Joint Family=== In this round, a word is split into various images and the contestants have to find the answer by stringing the images together. each picture means a separate word. More than one word is picture is given and the teams have to guess having in mind that only the pictures together will make sense. In this round also, the participants have to guess four words in 30 seconds each. ===Round 3: Tent Kottai=== In this round, negative markings to teams who press the buzzer and give wrong/no answer. Totally, there are six guesses and the team pressing the buzzer first will answer. One advantage is that the pictures also indicate what the team has to guess, i.e., a person's name or a country or a movie or a song etc. ===Round 4: Panchathanthiram=== The 4th Round is the deciding round for which team is the best connector. It gives totally five pictures one by one and each picture may be linked to one word. Jagan will inform the team as to what they are guessing just like in round three. Keeping that in mind and also the pictures the teams can guess. The lesser number of pictures the team uses to guess the right word, the more is the number of points. The total point for this round is 50. ==Remake== The show has been remade into in Telugu language and Kannada language as Connexion broadcast on MAA TV and Star Suvarna and olso remade in Sri Lanka Sinhala language Channel. ==References== ==External links== *official website *STAR Vijay on Youtube *STAR Vijay US *Star Vijay Malaysia Category:Vijay TV television series Category:2013 Tamil- language television series debuts Category:Tamil-language talk shows Category:Tamil-language game shows Category:Tamil-language television shows Category:2017 Tamil-language television series endings ",
