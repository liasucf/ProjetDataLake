In 1920 both the Duluth, Mesaba & Northern Railway Company and the Duluth & Iron Range Railway Company operated fireboats in Duluth, the William A. McGonacle and the Halle. In 2016 it was reported that the Duluth and Superior Fire Department would be receiving a modern powerful fireboat through a FEMA Port Security Grant. In recent years firefighters had been reduced to fighting fires using only an inflatable boat. The Marine 19, a fireboat, manufactured by Lake Assault Boats, was delivered on May 8, 2019. She was built with the assistance of a FEMA port security grant. ==References== Category:Government of Duluth, Minnesota Duluth Category:Firefighting in Minnesota Category:Water transportation in Minnesota ",
