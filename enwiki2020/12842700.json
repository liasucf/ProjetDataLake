His father was businessman Robert Kindersley, 1st Baron Kindersley GBE. ==Early years== Kindersley was born in Knightsbridge, London, to Robert Molesworth Kindersley, 1st Baron Kindersley, GBE (1871-1954), and Gladys Margaret Beadle. He was educated at Eton College. He married Nancy Farnsworth (daughter of Dr Geoffrey Boyd of Toronto) in October 1921: they had two daughters, Patricia, who married Napier Crookenden, Ginette and a son Robert, who succeeded his father as 3rd Baron Kindersley. Kindersley was managing director of Lazard Brothers, one of the three houses of Lazard, from 1927 to 1964. ===War service=== Kindersley was commissioned into the Scots Guards in 1917 and served during the First World War. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1918. He rejoined as a lieutenant in the Regular Army Reserve of Officers from 12 November 1938 and at the outbreak of the Second World War he rejoined the Scots Guards. He later commanded a tank battalion of the Scots Guards in the Guards Armoured Division. He completed a parachute training course and qualified as a glider pilot. In May 1943, promoted to acting Brigadier, The Honourable Hugh Kindersley was appointed Commanding officer of the 6th Airlanding Brigade. It was on his recommendation that Major John Howard and D Company 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (the 52nd) were selected to lead the coup de main operation at Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge before the Allied invasion of the Normandy beaches began. Kindersley commanded 6 Airlanding Brigade, part of 6th Airborne Division, during the Normandy landings on D Day, 6 June 1944, landing at 03.30 hours with 6 Airborne divisional headquarters. He was later wounded during the Battle of Br\u00e9ville, and evacuated to England. Brigadier Edwin Flavell replaced him as commanding officer of 6 Airlanding Brigade. Kindersley was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1941 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1945. ==Post-war== Kindersley was Chairman of Lazard Brothers, one of the three houses of Lazard, from 1953 until 1964 and a director from 1965 to 1971. During his service at Lazard Brothers, he was a director of the Bank of England from March 1947 to March 1967, Chairman of Royal Exchange Assurance from 1955 to 1967, and Chairman of Rolls-Royce Limited from 1956 to 1968. He was one of the figures who, as both a Bank of England director and a financier with private interests, was suspected of having taken advantage of advance warning of a change in Bank Rate to sell gilt-edged securities ahead of the public announcement of the rate change. A judicial inquiry was held to investigate these allegations in 1957, to which he gave evidence. Although subjected to intensive and aggressive questioning by the Solicitor General Reginald Manningham-Buller during the proceedings, he was fully exonerated in Lord Justice Parker's subsequent report in what journalists at the time suspected of a whitewash.David Kynaston, Till Time's Last Stand: A History of The Bank of England, 1694-2013, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017, pp. 434-5 Kindersley was chairman of the Officers Association from 1946 to 1956, Honorary Colonel of 10th Parachute Battalion from 1947 to 1952 and High Sheriff of the County of London in 1951.
