    "text": "{| |} The Georges Leygues class (Type C70 AS or Type F70 AS) is a class of anti-submarine destroyers of the French Navy. They are multi-role ships due to their Exocet and Crotale missile armament, making them especially suitable for the defence of strategic positions, show of force operations, or as high seas escorts. The design was initially officially known as a \"corvette\" with the designation C70, but were internationally labelled an \"anti-submarine destroyer\" (hence the \"D\" in the hull numbers). Subsequently, the French referred to the ships as \"frigates\" with the designation F70. ==Design== The superstructures were built to optimise resistance to the blast from nuclear explosions. The last three ships of the class had their bridges raised one deck to overcome problems experienced by the first four in bad weather, as well as being equipped with DSBV 61 passive linear towed array sonar and several other upgraded systems.
