The Des Moines Valley Railroad built the first tracks through the area in 1865, and they built a simple frame depot to serve passenger's needs. For ten years Pella was the only rail stop in Marion County. with The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad leased the Des Moines Valley's tracks beginning in 1878 and provided service through 1980. This single story, brick depot that was a typical design used by the railroad, replaced the old frame building in 1906. It served as a passenger station until 1973. After the Rock Island Line sought bankruptcy protection the depot's existence was uncertain. The Pella Corporation, whose headquarters are adjacent, acquired the property and converted the depot into a company museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. ==References== Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1906 Category:Railway stations closed in 1973 Pella Category:Former railway stations in Iowa Category:Pella, Iowa Category:Museums in Marion County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, Iowa Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Marion County, Iowa Category:1906 establishments in Iowa Category:1973 disestablishments in Iowa ",
