    "text": "Mt. Sisa is a heavily eroded pleistocene stratovolcano in Hela, Papua New Guinea. The taller of the mountain's two main peaks is estimated to be high. The northern peak has a communications mast. The epicentre of the 2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake was on the mountain's northern foothills. A tiny species of frogs, Choerophryne allisoni, is only known from its type locality on Mount Sisa. ==See also== *Mount Sisa languages == References == Category:Stratovolcanoes of Papua New Guinea ",
