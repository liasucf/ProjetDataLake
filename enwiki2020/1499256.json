    "text": "Danger Island is a live-action adventure serial produced by Hanna-Barbera and originally broadcast in 1968\u201369 as a segment of The Banana Splits Adventure Hour. It was filmed in Mexico, directed by future Superman, The Goonies and Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner, and featured Jan-Michael Vincent as Lincoln 'Link' Simmons. The series comprises a six-hour adventure yarn broken down into 36 short chapters. Each chapter is roughly ten minutes long and includes a suspenseful cliffhanger ending that is resolved in the next installment. The live-action segment was created to cut production costs on the mostly-animated hour-long show. ==Plot== Inspired by the animated Hanna- Barbera series Jonny Quest,The history of Danger Island Danger Island depicted the adventures of a trio of explorers in an unnamed tropical island group: Prof. Irwin Hayden, an archaeologist; Lincoln \"Link\" Simmons, the professor's youthful assistant; and Leslie, the professor's daughter, who serves as both a love interest for Link and the series' token damsel in distress. Several years earlier, the professor's brother (also an archaeologist) disappeared in the same island chain while searching for the mythical lost city of Tobanya. They are joined on their quest by Morgan, a shipwrecked merchant mariner, and his sidekick Chongo, who speaks only in a series of monkey-like chatters and birdcalls. They are pursued by a group of bumbling, but heavily armed, modern- day pirates led by the murderous Captain Mu-Tan, and by three tribes of cannibal natives known as \"the Headhunters\", \"the Skeleton Men\" and \"the Ash Men\". The show spawned a popularTV Tropes:Banana Splits catchphrase, \"Uh-oh, Chongo!\", among children of that time. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== *Prof. Irwin Hayden \u2013 Frank Aletter *Lincoln 'Link' Simmons \u2013 Jan-Michael Vincent (as Michael Vincent) *Leslie Hayden \u2013 Ronne Troup *Elihu Morgan \u2013 Rockne Tarkington *Chongo \u2013 Kim Kahana (as Kahana) ===Villains=== *Captain Mu- Tan \u2013 Victor Eberg *Chu \u2013 Rodrigo Arrendondo ==References== Category:The Banana Splits Category:1968 American television series debuts Category:1969 American television series endings Category:1960s American children's television series Category:American children's adventure television series Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Hanna-Barbera Category:Television shows set on islands Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series segments ",
