It\u2019s unfortunate they didn\u2019t make the final cut, but regardless the album is still fanastic. Tessanne Chin did an exceptional job for her first album. The lyrics are deep and the songs are soulful; whether they\u2019re slow reggae ballads or fast paced rock jams, she delivers without a pinch of error. A flawless record demanding a place within your music collection. Ahmad Tafari of The Reggae Vibe wrote that the album was \"Reggae, Rock and Soul all put together beautifully in between words.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Tessanne Chin. == References == Category:2010 debut albums ",
