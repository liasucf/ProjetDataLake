It is named after its founder, Swienca or Swieca (Polish \u015awi\u0119ca, German Swenzo; referred to as Swenzo, Swenso or Suenzo in contemporary documentsCf. the respective entries in Pommersches Urkundenbuch and Pomerellisches Urkundenbuch), the elder of two brothers. In Pomerelia, the Swiencas were transiently the most powerful family after the dukes.Hartmut Boockmann, Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas.

The Puttkamer family considers them to be their first documented ancestors. However, historians are divided on this issue. ==AncestryDetlev Schwennicke, Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln. Neue Folge.
