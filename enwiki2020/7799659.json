Harold is listed with the occupation of actor. ==Career== Very little is known about Graybill's film and stage career. It is unclear when Graybill left Milwaukee. His first appearance was in a film released in 1909 titled The Light That Came directed by D.W. Griffith. A few newspaper accounts mention Graybill stage and film acting. In October 1910 Graybill performed in a play titled Miss Patsy (by Sewell Collins) at the (now demolished) Belasco Theatre in Washington, D.C. His character was named Dr. Philip Gentry.Washington Post, October 4, 1910. Page 5. In May 1908 Graybill appeared in a performance of \"The Witching Hour\" by Augustus Thomas at a Cedar Rapids, Iowa theater.Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, May 2, 1908. Page 9. In October 1909 he appeared in a performance of \"Vasta Herne\" by Edward Peple in Des Moines, Iowa. A newspaper review noted that the play opened the three weeks prior in Milwaukee.Iowa Unionist, October 1, 1909. Page 11. A Wisconsin newspaper noted in July 1916 that a film titled \"Saved From Himself\" was reissued. The paper stated that Mabel Normand appeared opposite \"the late Joseph Graybill. Mr. Graybill, it will be remembered, was a young actor of unusual promise who died three years ago.\"Janesville Daily Gazette, July 27, 1916. Page 6. Two photos of Graybill can be found in the book When the Movies Were Young by Linda Arvidson Griffith (1969). The photos depict scenes in \"How She Triumphed\" and \"The Italian Barber\".Griffith, Linda Arvidson. When the Movies Were Young. New York: Dover Publications, 1969. ==Death== Graybill died in New York City on August 3, 1913 according to his death certificate. Different records state conflicting information as to the cause of death. The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) lists it as acute spinal meningitis.Internet Movie Database The first death notice in the New York Times contradicts the death certificate as to the day of death - it lists the cause of death on August 2 as a nervous breakdown.New York Times, August 2, 1913, page 7. An obituary on August 4 lists the cause as gastritis.New York Times, August 4, 1913, page 7. Graybill's death certificate and the first death notice both note he entered Bellevue Hospital July 24.
