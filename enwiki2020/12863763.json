It was recorded by John Naclerio and mixed by Dan Coutant. ==Release== We're in Like Sin was released on August 21, 2007 through label Broken English Records. In September, the group went on the School's for Fools tour across the US, alongside Valencia, We the Kings and Metro Station. However, partway through the tour Valencia had to drop off the tour due to their vocalist Shane Henderson having strep throat. As a result, Just Surrender headlined the rest of the dates. In July 2008, the band performed on the 2008 edition of Warped Tour. In October and November, the band went on tour alongside the Higher, the Morning Of and the White Tie Affair. ==Track listing== #\"Body Language and Bad Habits\" #\"So Close / So Alive\" #\"If I Wanted To Cuddle I'd Buy a Teddy Bear\" #\"I Said it Before\" #\"Your Life and Mine\" #\"New Declaration\" #\"Payback\" #\"You'd Be in Great Shape If You Ran Like Your Mouth\" [feat.
