    "text": "Frederiksberg () is a part of the Capital Region of Denmark. It is formally an independent municipality, Frederiksberg Municipality, separate from Copenhagen Municipality, but both are a part of the City of Copenhagen. It occupies an area of less than 9 km2 and had a population of 103,192 in 2015. Frederiksberg is an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen Municipality. Some sources ambiguously refer to Frederiksberg as a quarter or neighbourhood of Copenhagen, being one of the four municipalities that constitute the City of Copenhagen (the other three being Copenhagen, T\u00e5rnby and Drag\u00f8r). See also: Provinces of Denmark. However, Frederiksberg has its own mayor and municipal council, and is fiercely independent. Frederiksberg is an affluent area, characterised by its many green spaces such as the Frederiksberg Gardens, S\u00f8ndermarken, and Hostrups Have. Some institutions and locations that are widely considered to be part of Copenhagen are actually located in Frederiksberg. For example, Copenhagen Zoo as well as several stations of the Copenhagen Metro (the stations Forum, Frederiksberg, Fasanvej, Lindevang, and Flintholm) are located in Frederiksberg. The Copenhagen S-train system also has several stations in Frederiksberg, including Peter Bangs Vej station and Flintholm station. ==History== The British Bombardment of 1807. Lower right: soldiers with cannons; Frederiksberg Palace. Background: Amager and the \u00d8resund Julius Thomsens Square with St. Mark's Church at back Frederiksberg's original name was , a combination of the Danish words (thyle) and (hill), indicating that a thyle lived there, the reciter of eldritch times. The term is known from the Snoldelev rune stone. In Beowulf, Unferth holds the same title. In H\u00e5vam\u00e5l, Odin himself is referred to as \"the old thul\". Thula translates as \"song\", like in the Rigsthula poem from the Edda. By 1443 the name Tuleh\u00f8j was spelled Tullesh\u00f8y. It was regarded as Copenhagen's border to the west. People have lived in the area since the Bronze Age. The history of Frederiksberg goes back to 2 June 1651 when King Frederik III gave 20 Danish-Dutch peasants the rights to settle at All\u00e9gade (from the words all\u00e9 (tree-lined street) and gade (street)), and founded the town then named \"Ny Amager\" (New Amager) or \"Ny Holl\u00e6nderby\" (New Dutchman-town). Farming was not very successful, and in 1697 most of the town burned down. This meant that the peasants were unable to pay taxes, and the land reverted to the crown by Frederik III's son Christian V. In 1700\u20131703, King Frederik IV built a palace on top of the hill known as Valby Bakke (bakke = hill). He named the palace Frederichs Berg, and the rebuilt town at the foot of the hill consequently changed its name to Frederiksberg. A number of the local houses were bought by wealthy citizens of Copenhagen who did not farm the land, but rather used the properties as country houses. The town changed slowly from a farming community to a merchant town, with craftsmen and merchants. During the summer rooms were offered for rent, and restaurants served food to the people of Copenhagen who had left the cramped city for the open land, and to be near the royals. Initially the town grew slowly with population growing from 1,000 in 1770, to 1,200 in 1800, and to 3,000 in 1850. In 1852, Parliament removed restrictions which prohibited permanent construction outside Copenhagen's city walls. Almost immediately numerous residential areas were constructed, starting in the eastern part near Copenhagen, and ending in the western part farthest away from Copenhagen in 1950. This led to rapid population growth; in 1900 the population reached 80,000, and in 1950 Frederiksberg peaked with a population of 120,000. Today Frederiksberg consists almost entirely of 3- to 5-story residential houses, large single-family homes, and large parks; only a few small areas with light industry remain. ==Geography== Fredericksberg's location inside Copenhagen's municipality area Frederiksberg Have Frederiksberg All\u00e9 Frederiksberg, which lies west of central Copenhagen, is completely surrounded by boroughs forming part of the city of Copenhagen \u2013 the result of an expansion of the Copenhagen Municipality's boundary in 1901, which nevertheless did not include Frederiksberg in the list of municipalities to be incorporated in the enlarged area. Frederiksberg is thus effectively a municipal island within the country's capital \u2013 a unique phenomenon in present-day Europe. Other than administratively, however, it is largely indistinguishable in character from the districts of Copenhagen city which surround it. Frederiksberg has several stations on the Copenhagen Metro system, and is home to the tallest residential structure in Denmark and the second tallest residential building in Scandinavia: the 102-metre high Domus Vista. ==Culture== The Danmark Rundt cycling race traditionally finishes on Frederiksberg Alle, often in a sprint finish. ===Education=== Frederiksberg houses the University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus, Copenhagen Business School, 9 public schools (run by the municipality), 3 private schools, 1 technical college, and more. The Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Prins Henrik, a French international school, is in Frederiksberg.\"Plan d\u2019acc\u00e8s\" /S\u00e5dan finder du skolen . Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Prins Henrik.
