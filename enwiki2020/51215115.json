    "text": "Jacob by Zurbar\u00e1n Jacob and his twelve sons () is a series of thirteen paintings by Spanish artist Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n. The series of life-size portraits was painted between 1641 and 1658.G\u00e1llego, Juli\u00e1n; Gudiol, Jos\u00e9 (1987). Zurbar\u00e1n. London: Alpine Fine Arts Collection, Ltd. pp. 353\u2013354. . Twelve of the thirteen paintings are in Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, England, and one is in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. The series traveled to the Americas for the first time in 2016, to be displayed at the Meadows Museum in Dallas, Texas, from 17 September 2017 until 7 January 2018, and then in New York City at the Frick Collection from 31 January until 22 April 2018. ==Paintings== The depiction of Jacob and his sons in epic portraits in unusual for the era. More commonly, artists, including Ribera and Vel\u00e1zquez, included these men in narrative painting of Biblical episodes. According to art historian Jeannine Baticle, a series of Jacob and his sons survives in the possession of the Orden Tercera de San Francisco in Lima, Peru, which she describes as a \"fairly close replica\" of the Auckland Zurbar\u00e1n series. An additional series, \"a more distant and awkward imitation\" by an imitator, is in the possession of the Academia de Bellas Artes in Puebla, Mexico. ==History== It is not known how the paintings reached England, although some speculate that they may have been captured by English pirates while traveling from the painter's studio in Seville to a buyer in a Spanish colony in the Americas. The series is first recorded in 1722 as part of the estate of one William Chapman. It was later owned by London Banker James Mendez, whose heirs sold twelve of the thirteen to Richard Trevor, Bishop of Durham in 1757. Bishop Trevor, a political liberal and a backer of the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753, acquired the paintings, and redesigned and reconstructed the Long Dining Room at Auckland Palace, as a public statement of his support for Jewish naturalization rights. Although the Bill was quickly repealed, the paintings still hang in the Long Dining at Auckland. The portrait of one of Jacob's sons, Benjamin, was sold separately to the Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven; it hangs in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. Bishop Trevor commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy painting of \"Benjamin\". It hangs, with Jacob and the other eleven sons, in the Castle's Long Dining Room, which Bishop Trevor rebuilt for the purpose of displaying the pictures. ===21st century=== In 2001 the Church Commissioners voted to sell the paintings, a decision that was revoked in 2011 following a donation of \u00a315 million by investment manager and philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer; new arrangements placed the paintings, along with the castle, under the Auckland Castle Trust, making them available to the public after centuries during which they hung in a private home where they could be seen only by invited guests or by special arrangement with the Bishop's staff.Jonathan Garnier Ruffer bio at Debrett's People of Today www.ft.com ==Gallery== Jacob (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Jacob Reuben (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Reuben Simeon (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Simeon Levi (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Levi Judah (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Judah Dan (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Dan Naphtali (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Naphtali Gad (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Gad Asher (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Asher Issachar (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Issachar Zebulun (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Zebulun Joseph (Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Joseph Benjamin (after Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n).jpg|Benjamin ==References== ==External links== Category:Paintings by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n Category:Painting series ",
