    "text": "Pseudoseisuropsis is a genus of extinct birds in the ovenbird family from the Pleistocene of Argentina and Uruguay. The genus was described in 1991 based on disarticulated skeletal elements and a nearly-complete skull. Although originally believed to be closely related to the extant genus Pseudoseisura, phylogenetic analyses suggested a more basal origin within the family. ==Species== * Pseudoseisuropsis nehuen Noriega, 1991 * Pseudoseisuropsis cuelloi Claramunt & Rinderknecht, 2005 * Pseudoseisuropsis wintu Stefanini et al., 2016 ==References== Category:Furnariidae Category:Furnariidae stubs Category:Pleistocene birds Category:Pleistocene animals of South America ",
