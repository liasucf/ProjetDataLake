The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, European ethnic heritage, and exploration/settlement. It was nominated for being West-central Minnesota's most prominent house of a single individual who established and promoted a rural townsite, and for being the oldest and most architecturally significant Victorian house in Murdock. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Swift County, Minnesota ==References== Category:1878 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Swift County, Minnesota Category:Houses completed in 1878 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Swift County, Minnesota ",
