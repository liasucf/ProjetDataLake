The New Dance Sound of Detroit is a 1988 compilation of early Detroit techno tracks released on the Virgin Records UK imprint 10 Records.Sicko 1999:98 The compilation's title helped establish the term \"techno\" as the name for electronic dance music emerging out of Detroit in the 1980s.Brewster 2006:354Reynolds 1999:71. Detroit's music had hitherto reached British ears as a subset of Chicago house; [Neil] Rushton and the Belleville Three decided to fasten on the word techno \u2013 a term that had been bandied about but never stressed \u2013 in order to define Detroit as a distinct genre. ==Background== Compiled by techno producer Derrick May and Kool Kat Records boss Neil Rushton (at the time an A&R; scout for Virgin's \"10 Records\" UK imprint), the album was an important milestone and marked, in the UK, the introduction of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music.Brewster 2006:354 Previously, the style was characterized as Detroit's interpretation of Chicago house rather than a genre unto itself. Detroit's \"techno\"... and many more stylistic outgrowths have occurred since the word \"house\" gained national currency in 1985. In fact, the compilation's working title had been The House Sound of Detroit until the addition of Juan Atkins' song \"Techno Music\" prompted reconsideration. Rushton was later quoted as saying he, Atkins, May, and Saunderson came up with the compilation's final name together, and that the Belleville Three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house; they instead favored a term they were already using, techno. ==Release and legacy== Commercially, the release did not fare as well as expected, and it failed to recoup, however Inner City's production \"Big Fun\" (1988), a track that was almost not included on the compilation, became a massive crossover hit in fall 1988.Sicko 2010:118\u2013120 The record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to May, Atkins and Saunderson, which led to discussions with ZTT records about forming a techno supergroup called Intellex. But, when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract, May allegedly refused to agree to Top of the Pops appearances and negotiations collapsed.Sicko 2010:71 According to May, ZTT label boss Trevor Horn had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a \"black Petshop Boys.\" RBMA called the compilation \"genre-defining.\" The compilation was the first introduction to techno for many European listeners, particularly in England, Belgium, and Germany. European musicians would subsequently be inspired to develop their own takes on the style. ==Track listing== #Rythim Is Rythim - \"It Is What It Is\" (6:45) #Blake Baxter - \"Forever and a Day\" (5:39) #Eddie \"Flashin'\" Fowkles - \"Time to Express\" (5:44) #K.S.
