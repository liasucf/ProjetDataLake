He is best known for his work on role-playing video games such as Planescape: Torment and the Fallout series. ==Biography== Avellone is an alumnus of the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. He studied at the College of William & Mary, graduating with a major in English and a minor in fine arts, focused on architecture. Working initially as a freelancer in the two years after college, Avellone wrote campaigns for Dungeons & Dragons-inspired fantasy role-playing games. After entering the video game industry through the company Interplay in 1995, he briefly worked on the development of the 1997 title Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. In 1997 he took over the development of Descent to Undermountain, which he later called a disappointment. Avellone contributed to the 1998 game Fallout 2 and continued to work on its franchise. Interplay acquired the rights to produce a role-playing video game set in the Planescape campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons with the development led by Avellone. The game, Planescape: Torment was released in 1999 and received critical acclaim for its narrative, where it has been cited as one of the best-written games of all time. Avellone worked on all the games of the Icewind Dale series, which were released from 2000 to 2002. As a designer, Avellone contributed to the fantasy titles Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (2001), Champions of Norrath (2004) and led the design of the canceled Fallout title Van Buren, after which he resigned from Interplay and co-founded Obsidian Entertainment. For the company, Avellone worked on the role-playing games Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II (2004) and Neverwinter Nights 2 (2006) and on the action role- playing game Alpha Protocol. He also worked as a senior designer on Fallout: New Vegas. He worked as the project director and lead creative designer on Dead Money, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road Fallout: New Vegas downloadable content. Avellone worked as a narrative designer on Pillars of Eternity prior to leaving Obsidian Entertainment in June 2015. Avellone has since worked as a freelancer on games such as Pillars of Eternity, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Prey, Divinity: Original Sin II, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, and Into the Breach. In June 2020, Avellone was accused by three people of using his status for sexual misconduct and harassment towards women during industry conventions. Following these accusations, Techland announced that they and Avellone agreed to end his work on Dying Light 2. Gato Studios also removed Avellone from The Waylanders. Paradox Interactive said that while Avellone had worked on an early version of Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2, much of his work had since been overwritten. ==Works== ===Video games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role(s) |- | 1996 | Conquest of the New World || Designer |- | 1997 | Star Trek: Starfleet Academy || Additional mission design |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 1998 | Descent to Undermountain || |- | Fallout 2 || Designer |- | 1999 | Planescape: Torment || |- | 2000 | Icewind Dale || Designer |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2001 | Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter || Designer |- | Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance || Senior designer |- | 2002 | Icewind Dale II || Designer |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2003 | Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound || Senior designer |- | Van Buren || Lead designer |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2004 | Champions of Norrath || |- | Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords || |- | 2006 | Neverwinter Nights 2 || Senior designer |- | 2007 | Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer || Senior designer |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2010 | Alpha Protocol || |- | Fallout: New Vegas || |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2014 | FTL: Advanced Edition || Writer |- | Wasteland 2 || Level design |- | 2015 | Pillars of Eternity || Writer |- | 2016 | Tyranny || |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 2017 | Torment: Tides of Numenera || Writer |- | Prey || Writer |- | Divinity: Original Sin II || Additional narrative designer |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 2018 | Into the Breach || Writer |- | Pathfinder: Kingmaker || Narrative designer |- | Omensight || Writer |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2019 | Degrees of Separation || Writer |- | Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order || Writer |- | 2020 | System Shock || Writer |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2021 | Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms|| |- |Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous |Narrative designerhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/owlcatgames/pathfinder-wrath-of- the-righteous |- | TBA | Burden of Command || Advisor |} ===Comic books=== Star Wars comics: *Unseen, Unheard (2005) *Heroes on Both Sides (2006) *Impregnable (2007) *Old Scores (2007) *Graduation Day (2007) Fallout comics: * All Roads (2010, part of the Fallout: New Vegas collector's edition) ===Fiction=== * The House of Wael (2016, to Pillars of Eternity Kickstarter backers) ===Tabletop role-playing game modules=== * The Puzzle Box (2020, to Pathfinder: Kingmaker Kickstarter backers) ==References== ==External links== * * The Guardian interview with Chris Avellone * SugarBombed interview with Chris Avellone (part 1). *Chris Avellone Interview with Scripts & Scribes.
