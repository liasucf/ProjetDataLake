    "text": "Entra\u00f1as () is the third mixtape by Venezuelan electronic music producer Arca. It was released for free download on 4 July 2016 through Arca's SoundCloud page and Mediafire. It features contributions from Total Freedom, Massacooraman and Mica Levi, who is also known as Micachu. Even though 14 tracks are listed, the entire mixtape is in sequence as a single track. The music video for the track, \"Sin Rumbo\", debuted one day prior to mixtape's release. ==Critical reception== Upon release, Entra\u00f1as received universal acclaim from music critics. Consequence of Sound critic David Sackllah described the record as \"purely visceral, constantly obliterating conventions\" and thought \"the underlying frenetic nature of Entra\u00f1as makes it all the more unsettling when the mix reaches its final track, the four-minute 'Sin Rumbo'.\" Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork, who considered the mixtape as \"heavier and more unrelenting\" than Arca's previous release, Mutant (2015), described it as a \"quintessential Arca recording, commingling pleasure and terror and beauty and ugliness in the most thrilling ways possible.\" ===Accolades=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
