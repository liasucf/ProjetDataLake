Theater in Israel. University of Michigan Press, 1996. . pg.22. See Theater in Israel on Google Books Over the years the theater has shown over a thousand contemporary American and European plays, as well as original productions. In 1993, Zippi Pines started managing the theater. It was separated from the Histadrut and started showing mostly original Israeli material reflecting the political and social situation in Israel. In 2003, the theater moved from Lessin House to the old residence of the Cameri Theater after it was remodeled. This venue having more seats allowed larger and more expensive plays to be produced, such as Chicago and Guys and Dolls. The theater's production \"Mikveh\" won the Israeli Theater Prize in 2005. ==See also== *Theater of Israel ==References== ==External links== * Beit Lessin English Homepage Category:Theatre companies in Israel Category:Theatres in Tel Aviv Category:Arts organizations established in 1978 Category:Buildings and structures in Tel Aviv ",
