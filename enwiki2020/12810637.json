    "text": "The Bodhisattva Precepts (, Japanese: bosatsukai) are a set of moral codes used in Mahayana Buddhism to advance a practitioner along the path to becoming a Bodhisattva. Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a (such as that of the Dharmaguptaka), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well. ==Sets of Precepts== ===Brahmajala Sutra=== The Brahmajala Sutra, translated by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows. The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the \"Brahma Net Precepts\" (), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary: # Not to kill or encourage others to kill. # Not to steal or encourage others to steal. # Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely. # Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so. # Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so. # Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so. # Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so. # Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so. # Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. # Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel)) or encourage others to do so. Breaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows: ===Bodhisattvabhumi=== Asanga (circa 300 CE) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the \"Bodhisattvabhumi\" section of the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi \u015a\u0101stra.Gyatso 1995, pp.13-34 These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows: # Praising oneself or belittling others due to attachment to receiving material offerings, praise and respect. # Not giving material aid or (due to miserliness) not teaching the Dharma to those who are suffering and without a protector. # Not listening to others' apologies or striking others. # Abandoning the Mahayana by saying that Mahayana texts are not the words of Buddha or teaching what appears to be the Dharma but is not. # Taking things belonging to the Buddha, Dharma or Sangha. # Abandoning the holy Dharma by saying that texts which teach the three vehicles are not the Buddha's word. # With anger depriving ordained ones of their robes, beating and imprisoning them or causing them to lose their ordination even if they have impure morality, for example, by saying that being ordained is useless. # Committing any of the five extremely negative actions: (1) killing one's mother, (2) killing one's father, (3) killing an arhat, (4) intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or (5) causing schism in the Sangha community by supporting and spreading sectarian views. # Holding distorted views (which are contrary to the teaching of Buddha, such as denying the existence of the Three Jewels or the law of cause and effect etc.) # Destroying towns, villages, cities or large areas by means such as fire, bombs, pollution or black magic. # Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are unprepared. # Causing those who have entered the Mahayana to turn away from working for the full enlightenment of Buddhahood and encouraging them to work merely for their own liberation from suffering. # Causing others to abandon their Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a vows. # Belittling the \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na or Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na (by holding and causing others to hold the view that these vehicles do not abandon attachment and other delusions). # Falsely stating that oneself has realised profound emptiness and that if others meditate as one has, they will realize emptiness and become as great and as highly realized as oneself. # Taking gifts from others who were encouraged to give you things originally intended as offerings to the Three Jewels. Not giving things to the Three Jewels that others have given you to give to them, or accepting property stolen from the Three Jewels. # Causing those engaged in calm-abiding meditation to give it up by giving their belongings to those who are merely reciting texts or making bad disciplinary rules which cause a spiritual community not to be harmonious. # Abandoning either of the two types of bodhicitta (aspiring and engaging). According to Ati\u015ba, the Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow. ===The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts in S\u014dt\u014d Zen=== In the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen, the founder D\u014dgen established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources. Many various translations exist, the following is used by John Daido Loori, Roshi, founder of Zen Mountain Monastery:Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism ==== The Three Treasures ==== *Taking refuge in the Buddha *Taking refuge in the Dharma *Taking refuge in the Sangha The Three Treasures are universally known in Buddhism as the Three Refuges or Three Jewels. ==== The Three Pure Precepts ==== *Do not create Evil *Practice Good *Actualize Good For Others These are also known as the Three Root Precepts, and are mentioned in the Brahma Net Sutra as well. ==== The Ten Grave Precepts ==== *Respect life \u2013 Do not kill *Be giving \u2013 Do not steal *Honor the body \u2013 Do not misuse sexuality *Manifest truth \u2013 Do not lie *Proceed clearly \u2013 Do not cloud the mind *See the perfection \u2013 Do not speak of others' errors and faults *Realize self and others as one \u2013 Do not elevate the self and blame others *Give generously \u2013 Do not be withholding *Actualize harmony \u2013 Do not be angry *Experience the intimacy of things \u2013 Do not defile the Three Treasures ==Traditional uses== ===Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions=== The Chinese Chan monk, Yin Shun, wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, \"To cultivate bodhi mind means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds.\" In practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In East Asian Buddhism, a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional pr\u0101timok\u1e63a precepts first according to the vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the Four Part Vinaya (). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well. Monks and nuns are not considered \"ordained\" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the \"Four Part Vinaya\", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals. Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well. Such disciples often take the basic Five Precepts and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement. ===Japanese traditions=== In Buddhism in Japan, the \"Four-Part Vinaya\" was deemphasized with the rise of Saich\u014d and the Tendai sect and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the Brahmajala Sutras Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at T\u014ddai-ji in Nara and Saich\u014d had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a \"purely Mahayana lineage\", and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822. Later Buddhist sects in Japan, including the S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen, J\u014ddo-sh\u016b and Shingon Buddhism, adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by J\u014dkei and the Shingon Risshu revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the Meiji period, when the of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat- eating.Horii, Mitsutoshi (2006).
