    "text": "Willoughby is a suburb located on the lower North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 8 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Willoughby. The City of Willoughby takes its name from the suburb but its administrative centre is located in the adjacent suburb of Chatswood, which is the local area's major commercial centre. ==History== There is some conjecture as to how Willoughby was named. Some historians believe it was named after a parish, while others believe that Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell decided to commemorate Sir James Willoughby Gordon whom he had served during the Peninsular War and was the quartermaster-general in England when the First Fleet sailed to Botany Bay. Captain Arthur Phillip's search for \"good land, well watered\" led to the discovery and colonisation of the rough shores of Roseville Chase, where Samuel Bates built a farm at Echo Point.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 271 left Later developments included the building of the first post office in 1871 and the construction of Pommy Lodge in the same year. The latter\u2014a small sandstone building in Penshurst Street\u2014was originally the Congregational Church, which later changed premises. Laurel Bank Cottage, a single-storey home, was constructed in Penshurst Street in 1884. The cottage is now owned and run by the local Masonic Lodge as a function and conference facility. Circa 1920, Telford Lane\u2014between Fourth Avenue and Eastern Valley Way\u2014was created and paved; the method used was the one pioneered by Thomas Telford in England in the nineteenth century. This lane is one of the few surviving examples of the Telford method in Sydney. In 1934, the Willoughby incinerator was built in Small Street, after a design by Walter Burley Griffin. It has been described as \"a particularly successful example of an industrial building integrating function with site.\"The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/122 Like Telford Lane, the incinerator is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. == Heritage listings == Willoughby has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 85-87 Penshurst Street: Laurelbank * 2 Small Street: Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator, Willoughby ==Commercial area== upright Willoughby has a number of small shops, restaurants and hotels and is also home to the headquarters of the Nine Network, under the callsign of TCN-9.
