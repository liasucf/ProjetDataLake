A payor at the Treasure (1806), Royal censor (1820-1824), director of the mayors' newspaper (1822-1824), literary critic by the Moniteur universel et officiel, director and chief curator of the biblioth\u00e8que de l'Arsenal, then librarian at the Senate in 1854, where he succeeded Paul- Mathieu Laurent, Vieillard began early in the dramatic career. He produced no less than 30 plays, 24 of which were presented in different theaters, such as the Op\u00e9ra, the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville. The verve he spent in these various works, where he worked with Armand Gouff\u00e9, Georges Duval, Ren\u00e9 de Chazet, Dumersan, Jules Merle and Joseph Pain, did not prevent him to exploit the literary criticism which asked for more seriousness and a more complete maturity of mind on his part. Vieillard published in several newspapers, mainly in the former Moniteur universel, many articles that reflected the breadth and variety of his knowledge. He also became one of the principal editors of the Encyclop\u00e9die des gens du monde, where he was specially commissioned to write biographies about famous men of the French Revolution. Well versed in the history of that time, which he lived, the moderation of his opinions and the uprightness of his character let him naturally assess accurately the events and actors. Thus he could believe he was authorized to contribute the Le Moniteur Universel a series of studies on the ' by Lamartine, a work interrupted by the Revolution of 1848. Vieillard also had in the highest degree a feeling for music ; the last pamphlets he published in 1855 at the age of 78, testify of the passion of this dilettante. M\u00e9hul, Madame Scio, Vicissitudes d\u2019un librettiste de l\u2019ancien op\u00e9ra are the titles of these curious and interesting studies reproduced by le M\u00e9nestrel. Vieillard was particularly clever at finding a musical theme in a dramatic situation or a legend. At various occasions, the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts asked him seven cantatas. Only one was crowned and executed at the solemn session of the prize at the Institut in 1845. This time, the poet and the musician had drawn their inspirations in the ballad of Imogine, borrowed from the Monk by Matthew Gregory Lewis. Vieillard married Ana\u00efs-Henriette Formey Saint-Louvent (16 February 1802, Saint-L\u00f4 \u2013 16 November 1873, Versailles) 29 March 1826. He was made a chevalier of the Order of The Lily in 1814 and of the ordre royal de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1815, and was also a member of the acad\u00e9mies de Caen and Cherbourg. Vieillard signed his works under different forms of his name or initials and the pen names Madame P.V. de L.B. et Jules.Notice d'autorit\u00e9 personne de la BnF == Main publications == ;Theatre *1800: Gilles ventriloque, one-act parade mingled with vaudevilles, with Nicolas Gersin and Antoine Ann\u00e9e, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville, 5 March Text online *1800: Le Premier Homme du monde, ou la Cr\u00e9ation du sommeil, one-act folie-vaudeville, with Antoine Ann\u00e9e, Theatre of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, 30 December *1802: Marmontel, one-act comedy, in prose, mingled with vaudevilles, with Tournay and Armand Gouff\u00e9, Vaudeville, 23 August *1803: Le P\u00e8re d'occasion, one-act comedy, in prose, with Joseph Pain, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Louvois, 25 January *1805: Les Travestissements, comedy in 1 act and in prose, with Nicolas Gersin and Antoine Ann\u00e9e, Louvois, 7 August *1806: Noir et blanc, arlequinade, in 1 act and in vaudevilles, with Th\u00e9ophile Marion Dumersan, Vaudeville, 24 May *1806: Brutal, ou Il vaut mieux tard que jamais, com\u00e9die en vaudeville in 1 act and in prose, parody of Uthal by Jacques Bins de Saint-Victor, with Joseph-Marie Pain, Vaudeville, 31 May *1806: Chapelle et Bachaumont, vaudeville anecdotique in 1 act, with Georges Duval, Montansier, 30 August *1808: Le Retour au comptoir, ou l'\u00c9ducation d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, one-act com\u00e9die en vaudeville, with Georges Duval, Vaudeville, 14 May *1809: Malherbe, one-act comedy, mingled with vaudevilles, with Georges Duval, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, 27 May *1813: Les R\u00eaveurs \u00e9veill\u00e9s, parade magn\u00e9tique in 1 act, mingled with vaudevilles, with Joseph-Marie Pain, Vaudeville, 30 January *1816: Le Mariage de Robert de France, ou l'Astrologie en d\u00e9faut, one-act comedy in free verse, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, 22 June ;Varia *1802: La Bo\u00eete de Pandore et V\u00e9nus Callipyge, tales in verse Text online *1817: Po\u00e9sies nationales *1819: Aux missionnaires de l'irr\u00e9ligion Text online *1827: \u00c9poques m\u00e9morables de la r\u00e9volution et de la Restauration, m\u00e9langes en vers et en prose *1859: Souvenirs du th\u00e9\u00e2tre.
