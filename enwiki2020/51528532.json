    "text": "Dennis Man (born 26 August 1998) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays mainly as a winger for Liga I club FCSB and the Romania national team. He began his senior career in the Romanian second division with UTA Arad in 2015, and one year later signed for FCSB. Man has since appeared in over 130 matches for the capital-based club and won a Cupa Rom\u00e2niei in 2020. He made his senior debut for his nation in March 2018 after previously being capped at under-19 and under-21 levels. ==Club career== ===Early years=== While a junior at Atletico Arad in 2010, Man traveled to English club Manchester City for a trial and played a match for their youth team against Nottingham Forest. However, he returned to his native country and later joined UTA Arad. Man was promoted from the UTA academy in the summer of 2015, aged 17, and made his senior debut on 29 August in a 1\u20132 loss to Gaz Metan Media\u0219 for the Liga II championship. On 25 October, he scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20130 away win over Bihor Oradea. ===FCSB=== On 6 September 2016, FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti transferred Man for an undisclosed fee, with the player penning a one-year deal with the option of another five years which would be activated at the end of the season. His release clause was set at \u20ac50 million. Man made his debut for the Ro\u0219-alba\u0219trii on 2 October 2016 against CS Universitatea Craiova, coming on as a substitute for injured Florin T\u0103nase in the first half of the game; he himself was replaced in the 66th minute by Ovidiu Popescu, as his team eventually won 2\u20131. Later that month he netted his first Steaua\u2014and Liga I\u2014goal, in a 2\u20130 victory over CSM Politehnica Ia\u0219i. On 16 July 2017, Man scored an injury-time winner against FC Voluntari in the campaign's opener. He recorded his first European appearance in the UEFA Champions League's third qualifying round 4\u20131 away win against Viktoria Plze\u0148, on 2 August. On 25 October he contributed with two goals and two assists in the 6\u20131 thrashing of S\u0103n\u0103tatea Cluj for the Cupa Rom\u00e2niei, and on 17 December, Man opened the scoring in a 2\u20130 success over defending champions Viitorul Constan\u021ba. In January 2018, he was included by UEFA.com in a list of the fifty best young footballers to watch for that year. On 18 February, Man scored the first of his team in a 2\u20132 draw to rivals Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti after appearing as a half- time substitute. Following his impressive performances, he signed a new contract with FCSB which increased his release clause to \u20ac100 million. In July, he was nominated along with compatriot Ianis Hagi for the 2018 Golden Boy award. On the 25th that month, he scored his first European goal in a UEFA Europa League second qualifying round 2\u20130 away win over Rudar Velenje. Man won his first career trophy on 22 July 2020, after scoring the only goal of the Cupa Rom\u00e2niei final played against Sepsi Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe at the Ilie Oan\u0103 Stadium in Ploie\u0219ti. On 17 September, amidst a challenging situation in which nine of his teammates were infected with COVID-19, he scored a hat-trick in a Europa League second qualifying round away draw with Serbian team TSC Ba\u010dka Topola. The match ended 6\u20136 after extra time, and Man converted the winning goal in the eventual penalty shoot-out. Three days later, on his 100th Liga I appearance, he once again scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 defeat of Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti. ==International career== Man was selected for the Romania under-21 team and scored on debut in a 3\u20131 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 1 September 2017. Senior manager Cosmin Contra gave Man his first Romania call- up for the friendlies with Israel and Sweden in March 2018. He made his debut in the latter game, replacing Nicolae Stanciu in 87th minute as his side won 1\u20130 at the Stadionul Ion Oblemenco in Craiova. On 11 June 2019, he netted the last of his team in a 4\u20130 defeat of Malta counting for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers. Later that month, he joined up with the under-21 side for the UEFA Euro 2019, making three appearances as Romania was eliminated by Germany in the semi-finals. ==Personal life== His father, Cristian Man, is a football coach and former player in the Divizia B. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"3\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|UTA Arad |2015\u201316 |29||10||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||0|||34||11 |- |2016\u201317 |5||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||5||5 |- !Total !34!!15!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!39!!16 |- | rowspan=\"6\" |FCSB |2016\u201317 |6||1||1||0||2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||9||1 |- |2017\u201318 |34||10||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||47||12 |- |2018\u201319 |33||9||1||0||rowspan=1 colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||5||1||rowspan=1 colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||39||10 |- |2019\u201320 |23||7||5||2|| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |\u2013||3||0||rowspan=1 colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||31||9 |- |2020\u201321 |6 |6 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2013 |2 |3 |0 |0 |8 |9 |- !Total !102!!33!!10!!4!!2!!0!!20!!4!!0!!0!!134!!39 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !136!!48!!13!!5!!2!!0!!20!!4!!2!!0!!173!!57 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Romania |- |2018||2||0 |- |2019||2||1 |- !colspan=2|Total||4||1 |} ===International goals=== (Romania score listed first, score column indicates score after each Man goal) {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ International goals by date, venue, cap, opponent, score, result and competition |- !scope=col|No. !scope=col data-sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Venue !scope=col|Cap !scope=col|Opponent !scope=col|Score !scope=col|Result !scope=col|Competition |- !scope=row|1 | 10 June 2019 || National Stadium, Ta' Qali, Malta || align=center | 4 || || 4\u20130 || 4\u20130 || UEFA Euro 2020 qualification |} ==Honours== ===Club=== FCSB *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei: 2019\u201320 ===Individual=== *Liga I Team of the Season: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:People from Arad County Category:Romanian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Liga I players Category:Liga II players Category:FC UTA Arad players Category:FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti players Category:Romania youth international footballers Category:Romania under-21 international footballers Category:Romania international footballers ",
