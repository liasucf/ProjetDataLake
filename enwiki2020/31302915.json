    "text": "Madame Gr\u00e8s (1903\u20131993) born Germaine \u00c9milie Krebs, also known as Alix Barton and Alix, was a leading French couturier of her generation and costume designer. She founded the former haute couture fashion house \"Gr\u00e8s\" as well as the associated perfume house \"Parfums Gr\u00e8s\" which still exists today in Switzerland. Remembered as the \"Sphinx of Fashion\", Gr\u00e8s was notoriously secretive about her personal life and was seen as a workaholic with a furious attention to detail, therefore she preferred to let her work do the talking. Called the \"master of the wrapped and draped dress\" and \"queen of drapery\", Gr\u00e8s is best known for her floor-length draped Grecian goddess gowns. Gr\u00e8s's minimalistic draping techniques and her attention and respect for the female body have had a lasting effect on the haute couture and fashion industry and she is credited for inspiring a number of recent designers. == Biography == === Early life === Madame Gr\u00e8s was born and raised in Paris, France. Early in life, Gr\u00e8s studied painting and sculpting. Gr\u00e8s originally dreamed of becoming a sculptress but after many objections made by her family she shifted her interests towards the art of fashion design and clothing making. Using her formal training in sculpture, Gr\u00e8s was able to apply her sculpting techniques to her fabric forms. Gr\u00e8s's first job in the industry of fashion was a woman's hat maker where she excelled until she began focusing on couture dressmaking. After distinguishing her area of interest, Gr\u00e8s received her early training in haute couture dressmaking at the fashion house, Maison Premet, a house known for requiring extreme perfection. === Alix Era === In 1932, Gr\u00e8s opened her first couture fashion house, La Maison Alix. In 1933, Gr\u00e8s and her coworker, Juliette Barton, combined their names to create Alix Barton, which she designed under for a short amount of time. Gr\u00e8s dropped the \"Barton\" in 1934 and designed under her own name, \"Alix\", for the remainder of the 1930s and up until 1942. During this time, Gr\u00e8s's signature style of classical drapery and elegant gowns became the signature of the couture fashion house. At this time she became known for her technique of using live mannequins, designing and creating garments directly on the models. Her early work shows Greco-Roman sculpture influences as well as simple lines and attention to the female body. Her preferred media during this time was silk jersey and paper taffeta While operating her haute couture fashion house under the name Alix, she first gained positive attention and critical acclaim for designing costumes in 1935 for Jean Giraudoux's play, \"The Trojan War Will Not Take Place\". After receiving much applause for her theatrical costume designs, Gr\u00e8s became one of the leading designers of that time designing for many notable figures such as the Duchess of Windsor, Paloma Picasso, Grace Kelly, Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Garbo. === Madame Gr\u00e8s Era === In 1942, after marrying Russian painter, Serge Czerefkov, Gr\u00e8s began designing under the name \"Madame Gr\u00e8s\", a partial anagram of her husband's first name During World War II, after creation of the Madame Gr\u00e8s label, German troops invaded Paris and soon occupied it. During the war, German forces demanded that Madame Gr\u00e8s design bleak and utilitarian clothing which was in complete contrast to her entire collection. Gr\u00e8s defied their orders and continued to design garments that mirrored the colors of the French flag. Consequentially, after defying German's orders, German forces ordered Gr\u00e8s's haute couture fashion house to be closed claiming her generous use of fabric during wartime as their reasoning. After the closing of her first couture house, Gr\u00e8s fled to the Pyrenees and stayed there until Paris was liberated. In 1944, with the closing of her first couture house, Gr\u00e8s began designing again and opened her second house returning to her now signature name, Madame Gr\u00e8s. Throughout the 1940s, Madame Gr\u00e8s began constructing and perfecting her most notable garment, the elegantly draped Grecian goddess gowns. These dresses could take anywhere up to three hundred hours to complete with each pleat being done by hand draping the cloth so the body shaped the dress. Gr\u00e8s's signature dress perfectly captures who Gr\u00e8s was as a fashion designer. Her painstaking attention to detail, regard for the human body, and simplistic effects can be seen in each of her gowns. In the 1950s, Gr\u00e8s experimented with simpler cuts and purer lines using ethnic traditions such as saris, kimonos and serapes as her inspiration. In addition, Gr\u00e8s tried her hands as tailoring women's suits over the course of the 1950s. Gr\u00e8s's design focus remained mostly on her couture gowns throughout the rest of her career. Gr\u00e8s debuted her bestselling fragrance, Cabochard, in 1959 which translates to \"stubborn\". In 1970, Gr\u00e8s strayed away from her signature draping style and highlighted naked flesh. She highlighted the flesh by constructing vertical peek-a-boo openings in the bodice. In 1980, she launched her first two ready-to-wear collections in collaboration with the designer Peggy Huynh Kinh. Then she reiterated in 1983, with a collection which manufacturing process she wanted to master from start to finish. Gr\u00e8s continued to design at her fashion house up until her 80s when she retired from the Gr\u00e8s fashion house in the late 1980s. The final garment designed by Madame Gr\u00e8s was a swelling bodice dress ordered by Hubert de Givenchy in 1989. Soon after Madame Gr\u00e8s retired from the couture fashion house, The House of Gr\u00e8s, began to suffer. In 1984, The House of Gr\u00e8s was bought by Bernard Tapie and then later Jacques Esterel. Due to unpaid rent, a bankruptcy petition was issued and the house's assets were liquidated and the fashion house was sold to Yagi Tsusho Limited, a Japanese company, in 1993 they hired Lloyd Klein as the head designer . === Retirement/ Death === After retiring, Madame Gr\u00e8s lived life in even more secrecy than before. Due to poor business dealings regarding the licensing of her signature perfume, Cabochard, Madame Gr\u00e8s lost the fortune that she worked six decades to build leaving her living in poverty. With help from friends, Hubert Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, and Yves Saint Laurent, Gr\u00e8s was able to rent an apartment in the 16th arrondissement in Paris and continue sewing garments for friends. In 1993, Gr\u00e8s's daughter, Anne, moved her to a retirement home in near Toulon, France. On 24 November 1993, just a few days before her 90th birthday, Gr\u00e8s died. Her death was made public a year later. ===Marriage and children=== Madame Gr\u00e8s married Serge Czerefkov, a Russian painter, in the late 1930s. The two had one daughter named Anne at some point during their marriage. Gr\u00e8s's daughter is most notable for concealing her mother's death in 1993 for over a year and forging Gr\u00e8s's handwriting in documents. == Awards == * Named Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1947 * Elected president of elected President of Chambre Syndicale of Paris Couture in 1972 * D\u00e9 d'Or (Golden Thimble) for dressmaking by Cartier in 1976 * New York University Creative Leadership in the Arts Award in 1978 * Named \"Best in Italy\u201d by the National Chamber of Italian Haute Couture == References == == Bibliography == * Martin, Richard, and Harold Koda, Madame Gr\u00e8s, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1994 (available for download) * Patricia Mears, Madame Gr\u00e8s : Sphinx of Fashion, Yale University Press, 2008 * Olivier Saillard, Madame Gr\u00e8s: Sculptural Fashion, Cannibal/Hannibal Publishers, 2012 Category:1903 births Category:1993 deaths Category:French fashion designers Category:People from Paris Category:French costume designers Category:Women costume designers Category:Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
