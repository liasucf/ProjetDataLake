Accessed 5 November 2006. According to Klauber (1936), this species is characterized by the absence of the vertical light line on the posterior edge of the prenasal and first supralabial scales. The supraocular scales are pitted, sutured, or with the outer edges broken. The color pattern consists of a straw, tan, buff, brown, or gray ground color, overlaid with a series of buff, gray, brown, or deep red-brown blotches. Often, gray suffusions occur on the sides of the body and head, and a scattering of black-tipped scales occur on the back, especially at the edges of the blotches. ==Geographic range== Crotalus stephensi is found in desert-mountain areas of the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada from Mono County, California, east to Nye County, Nevada, south through southwestern Nevada, southeast to Clark County, Nevada, and southwest to central San Bernardino County, California at altitude. ==Feeding== The diet of C. stephensi consists of small mammals, lizards, and birds. ==Reproduction== Crotalus stephensi is ovoviviparous, and the young are born in July and August. Neonates are about 25 cm in total length. ==See also== * Snakebite ==References== ==Further reading== *Klauber LM (1930). \"New and Renamed Subspecies of Crotalus confluentus Say, with Remarks on Related Species\".
