The current appearance of the cathedral is the result of work done in 1864. After Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in 1998, several donations for the renovation of the cathedral were performed, which today is in very good condition. The church is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, the Virgen de la Candelaria. The most striking feature is the huge bell tower, topped with a statue of Christ. The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and is the seat of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Camag\u00fcey (Archidioecesis Camagueyensis) which was raised to its current status in 1998 by the bull \"Maiori spirituali\". The cathedral is part of the historic center of Camag\u00fcey, a UNESCO world heritage site since 2008. In January 2014 Pope Francis also conferred on it the title of minor basilica. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Cuba *Our Lady of Candelaria Cathedral ==References== ==External links== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Cuba Category:Buildings and structures in Camag\u00fcey Category:Basilica churches in Cuba ",
