    "text": "Nicol\u00f2 Gagliano (active. c. 1730s \u2013 1787 in Naples), although there is some discussion about the exact dates) (also known as Nicolo, Nicola or Nicolaus Gagliano - also sometimes known as Nicol\u00f2 I, to differentiate him from Nicol\u00f2 II, his grandson), was an Italian violin-maker, the eldest son of Alessandro Gagliano. He made many admirable instruments, often imitated. Some have been mistaken for those of Stradivari. Nicol\u00f2 was a more prolific maker than his brother Gennaro (Januarius). Nicol\u00f2 and Gennaro are considered the greatest luthiers in the Gagliano family and the pinnacle of Neapolitan violin-making. Although Nicol\u00f2's work is not always entirely consistent in quality, it often shows great distinction. His instruments have bold and well-proportioned archings, with the instrument scrolls having a distinctive elongated pegbox and small tight spiral. He often placed a small label with a religious dedication inside his instruments. Nicol\u00f2 Gagliano had four sons, all makers \u2014 Ferdinando, Giuseppe (Joseph), Antonio, and Giovanni. Giuseppe's three sons Raffaele, Antonio and Nicol\u00f2 (II) were also violin makers and carried the family's violin-making tradition into the middle of the 19th century.
