The town has a 15th-century church with a 19th-century tower, dedicated to Saint Mary and restored to designs by T. H. Wyatt,Michael Pitt-Rivers, 1966. Dorset. London: Faber & Faber. in 1878, which overlooks the town from a hill. The town has had market rights since the time of King George I, though it has not held a regular market for many years. In the town centre stands a 10-metre (30 ft) tall market cross, said to be the finest in the country.The Dorset Page, \"Stalbridge.\" Stalbridge was home to scientist Robert Boyle (see below), and writer Douglas Adams, who wrote much of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the town. The town also boasts that it is home to the oldest living male twins in the world. Artist Sir James Thornhill lived just south of the town, in Thornhill Park, which he bought in 1725. The house is believed to have been originally owned by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century. In 1727, Sir James Thornhill erected an obelisk in the park to honour the accession of King George II. From September 1863 Stalbridge was served by Stalbridge railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, with trains to Bath and Bournemouth. During World War II a Ministry of Food depot was situated here. The last train ran on 7 March 1966, and most of the tracks, station and goods yard have been replaced, though tracks still cross the road.Mike Oakley, 2001. Dorset Railway Stations. Wimborne: Dovecote Press === Stalbridge House === In 1618 Mervyn Tucher (or Audley), 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, who had inherited Stalbridge Park from his father, decided to build a mansion house on his Stalbridge estate. He enclosed an area used as common land to the northwest of the church, moving tenant farmers out, and built a Jacobean style mansion, the fifth largest house in Dorset. In 1631 the earl's eldest son James brought a case against him for \"unnatural practices\", and he was subsequently executed. James sold the house to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. After his father's death, the scientist Robert Boyle became Lord of the Manor, and the house was his residence between 1644 and 1652. It was here that he conducted many of his experiments. At some point during the house's history a high stone wall was built around the boundary of Stalbridge Park. There is some argument as to when and why the wall was built. It may have been commissioned by Castlehaven as a status symbol, work for French prisoners of the Napoleonic Wars, or as work for local labourers in times of high unemployment. By 1822 the house was in poor repair and the current owner, the Marquess of Anglesey, had it demolished.Denys Kay-Robinson, 1984. The Landscape of Thomas Hardy. Exeter, Webb & Bower By 1827 all that remained was the raised area where it had stood. The stone was sold off and much of it is in use elsewhere in the town, including the large farm house which now stands in the park. There are many popular local myths and ghost stories about the demise of the house, mostly involving a fire destroying the house. Stalbridge Park features in Thomas Hardy's Wessex as \"Stapleford Park\". ==Governance== Stalbridge is the major part of Blackmore electoral ward.

To the east of the high street, Station Road heads down the hill, heading towards the Stalbridge trading estates, passing the modern housing estates built in the 1970s.https://www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/media/163796/Stalbridge- Part-5.2-and-5.4-Eighteenth-nineteenth-and-twentieth-century- February-2011/pdf/Stalbridge_Part_5.2_and_5.4_Eighteenth_nineteenth_and_twentieth_century_February_2011.pdf To the West, the town climbs Barrow Hill, with older housing, some estates dating to the 1950s, and the 1990s Pond Walk.
