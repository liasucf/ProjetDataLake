It merged with Ballymena Borough Council and Carrickfergus Borough Council in May 2015 under the reorganisation of local government in Northern Ireland to become Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Its headquarters was in the town of Larne, one of the most modern roll on-roll off ferry ports in the United Kingdom with a busy passenger traffic with Scotland. The Borough of Larne was divided into 3 electoral areas: Larne Town, Larne Lough and Coast Road. At the final election in 2011 15 members were elected from the following political parties: 4 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 3 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 Independent, 3 Alliance Party, 1 Traditional Unionist Voice, 1 Sinn F\u00e9in and 1 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Aldermen Jack McKee (TUV) and Roy Beggs (UUP) were the longest serving councillors on the council.
