    "text": "was a Japanese sumo wrestler from Yanagawa, Chikugo Province. He was the sport's 10th yokozuna. ==Career== He was born in Yanagawa, Fukuoka, but would later changed his name to . He lost his parents and grandmother in 1833. He made his debut in Osaka sumo in May 1846. He moved to Edo in 1847. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division in February 1852. Unry\u016b was a strong wrestler at the beginning of his career. He had the equivalent of four consecutive championships upon entering the top makuuchi division (those this was before the championship system established in 1909). On the occasion of Matthew C. Perry's visit to Japan, he had an opportunity to display his wrestling prowess in a tournament Perry and his military advisors attended. He was promoted to \u014dzeki in January 1858. He was awarded a yokozuna licence in September 1861, but by that time he had already passed his peak and was unable to win a significant number of bouts after that. In the top makuuchi division, he won 127 bouts and lost 32 bouts, recording a winning percentage of 79.9. ==Retirement from sumo== Unry\u016b Ky\u016bkichi as an elder After his retirement in February 1865, he remained in the sumo world as an elder. He was the chairman (fudegashira) of Tokyo sumo in the early Meiji period, and he acquired a reputation for honesty. The name of one style of yokozuna dohy\u014d-iri (ring entering ceremony) came from him. His ritual dance was said to be beautiful but it isn't proven that he performed the ritual dance in the Unry\u016b style. His style is said to have been imitated by Tachiyama Mineemon, but Tachiyama's style is called shiranui style now. This was due to sumo scholar Kozo Hikoyama, who without researching properly, labelled Tachiyama's style as being that of Shiranui K\u014demon, whereas it was in fact created by Unry\u016b. Hikoyama was such an authority that no one contradicted him, and the Shiranui name has stuck. == Top division record == *The actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied. *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament and the above unofficial championships are historically conferred.
