    "text": "Fireside Theatre, a.k.a. Jane Wyman Presents, is an American anthology drama series that ran on NBC from 1949 to 1958, and was the first successful filmed series on American television. Productions were low budget and often based on public domain stories or written by freelance writers such as Rod Serling. While it was panned by critics, it remained in the top ten most popular shows for most of its run. It predated the other major pioneer of filmed TV in America, I Love Lucy, by two years. Jacques Tourneur has directed in 1956 three episodes, A Hero Return, Kirsti, and The Mirror. ==Overview== Director Sidney Lanfield and Jane Wyman on the set of Fireside Theatre (1955) Fireside Theatre was created by Frank Wisbar, who also wrote and directed many episodes. From 1952 to 1958, the program was presented by a host. This role was first filled by Wisbar (1952\u20131953), then by Gene Raymond (1953\u20131955), and finally by the person most associated with the series in the public mind, Jane Wyman (1955\u20131958). When episodes of this program were rerun on ABC during the summer of 1963, it was under the title Jane Wyman Presents; during the period first-run episodes were hosted by Wyman it was sometimes known as The Jane Wyman Show. One of Fireside Theatre's most notable offerings was a 1951 condensed version of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, featuring Ralph Richardson as Ebenezer Scrooge for the first and only time on American television.IMBD:Fireside Theater He later recreated the role on a spoken word Caedmon Records LP album, with Paul Scofield as narrator.
