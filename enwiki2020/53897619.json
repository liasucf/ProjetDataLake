    "text": "Shredder Orpheus is a 1990 film that has later become a cult classic. It was Amy Denio's film debut. ==Plot summary== Orpheus heads to the underworld with a skateboard and a guitar to save people from television mind control. ==Release== ===Film festival=== The film was shown at BAM Rose Cinemas on September 23, 2013. It was later shown again at The Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts as part of the theater's \"Trash Night\" on May 19, 2015. ===Soundtrack=== On November 11, 2014, the film's remastered soundtrack was released on vinyl by Light in the Attic Records under its Traction imprint. The music was composed by Roland Barker, Bill Rieflin, Dennis Rea, and Amy Denio. It is the only release of the soundtrack. The vinyl includes 17 songs and comes bundled with a Shredder Orpheus DVD. ==Reception== Nathan Phillips, writing for The Movie Elite said, \"Shredder Orpheus is a love letter to independent artistry and \u201980s counterculture that is, frankly, missing or underrepresented in today\u2019s social climate, and if it were possible to be nostalgic about the future, it would be via the attitudes present in the future as seen in Shredder Orpheus, a blast from the past.\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s science fiction films ",
