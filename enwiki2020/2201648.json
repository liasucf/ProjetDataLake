    "text": "Inverness Burghs was a district of burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain (at Westminster) from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (also at Westminster) from 1801 to 1918. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP). There was also, 1708 to 1918, the Inverness-shire constituency, which was, as its name implies, a county constituency. ==Creation== The British parliamentary constituency was created in 1708 following the Acts of Union, 1707 and replaced the former Parliament of Scotland burgh constituencies of Inverness, Forres, Fortrose and Nairn. ==Boundaries== As first used in the 1708 general election Inverness Burghs consisted of four burghs: Inverness in the county of Inverness, Fortrose in the county of Ross, Forres in the county of Elgin and Nairn in the county of Nairn. ==History== The constituency elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system until the seat was abolished for the 1918 general election. For the 1832 general election, as a result of the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832, the boundaries of burghs for parliamentary election purposes ceased to be necessarily those for other purposes. In 1918, as a result of the Representation of the People Act 1918, the component burghs of Inverness Burghs were merged into three different county constituencies: Inverness into the Inverness constituency, Forres and Nairn into the Moray and Nairn constituency and Fortrose into the Ross and Cromarty constituency. By this date, the county of Elgin had become the county of Moray and the county of Ross had been merged with the county of Cromarty to form the county of Ross and Cromarty. ==Members of Parliament== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Elected!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1708 | Alexander Duff | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1710 | George Mackenzie | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1713 | William Steuart | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1722 | Alexander Gordon | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1722 election petition | Duncan Forbes | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1737 by-election | Duncan Urquhart | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1741 | Kenneth Mackenzie | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1747 | Alexander Brodie | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1754 | John Campbell | |- |style=\"background- color: \" | | 1761 | Sir Alexander Grant, Bt | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1768 | Sir Hector Munro | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1802 | Alexander Cumming-Gordon | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1803 by- election | George Cumming | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1806 | Francis Ogilvy-Grant | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1807 | Peter Baillie | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1811 by-election | Charles Grant | |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1818 | George Cumming | Tory |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1826 | Robert Grant | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1830 | John Baillie | Tory |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1831 | Charles Cumming-Bruce | Tory |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1832 | John Baillie | Tory |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1833 by-election |rowspan=\"2\"| Charles Cumming-Bruce | Tory |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1834 | Conservative |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1837 | Roderick Macleod | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1840 by-election | James Morrison | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1847 |rowspan=\"2\"| Alexander Matheson | Whig |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1859 change | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1868 | Aeneas William Mackintosh | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1874 |rowspan=2\"| Charles Fraser-Mackintosh | Independent Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1880 | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1885 |rowspan=\"2\"| Robert Finlay | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1886 change | Liberal Unionist |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1892 | Gilbert Beith | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1895 | Robert Finlay | Liberal Unionist |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1906 | John Annan Bryce | Liberal |- |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 1918 |colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished |} ==Election results== The original electoral system for this constituency gave each of the four burghs one vote, with an additional casting vote (to break ties) for the burgh where the election was held. The place of election rotated amongst the burghs in successive Parliaments. The vote of a burgh was exercised by a burgh commissioner, who was elected by the burgh councillors. The first direct election in Inverness Burghs was in 1832. The votes from qualified electors, in each burgh, were added together to establish the result. Unless otherwise indicated, the primary source for the results was Craig. Candidates identified by Craig as Conservatives, in the 1832-1835 Parliament, are listed as Tories. In results for elections before the formal creation of the Liberal Party, shortly after the 1859 general election, candidates identified by Craig as Liberals are divided into Whigs and Radicals following Stooks Smith. Craig's registered electorate and vote figures are sometimes different from those of Stooks Smith, but Craig's figures are used below. For details of the books of Craig and Stooks Smith, see the Reference section below. In terms of change in % votes and swing, the Conservative candidate in 1835 is related to his performance as the Tory candidate in the 1833 by-election. As there were two Tory candidates in 1832, no swing figure was calculated for the 1833 by-election. {| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"center\" | 1760s \u2013 1830s \u2013 1840s \u2013 1850s \u2013 1860s \u2013 1870s \u2013 1880s \u2013 1890s \u2013 1900s \u2013 1910s |} ===Elections in the 1760s=== This is an example of a contested election, before the extension of the franchise in 1832.
