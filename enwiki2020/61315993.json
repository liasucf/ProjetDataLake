    "text": "BerriBlue (born 1992) is a female street artist, painter and fashion designer based in Porto, Portugal. == Biography == BerriBlue grew up in Gda\u0144sk, in northern Poland, and moved to Ireland in 2005 at the age of 13. She attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, specialising in fine print. BerriBlue moved to Portugal in 2016, where she started producing street art under the new pseudonym \"BerriBlue\" and launched a line of illustrated silk scarves. == Work == BerriBlue originally produced street art under the name \"JTB\". In 2012, her work appeared in \"Inside Out\", an anthology of Irish street art. BerriBlue's street art work is well known in Porto, dealing with themes such as personal identity, sexuality, mental health, and death. Most of her pieces are pasteups, which are very a common sight in Porto city centre and have also appeared in other European cities. Her \"Death\" project became very popular in 2016, featuring large black skeleton figures painted, on walls around the city centre. Her studio work deals with the same themes as her street art work. She often works on plywood, brown packing paper and newsprint. She was recognised by Jornal de Not\u00edcias as one of Porto's foremost contemporary female illustrators, and she has exhibited with some of Porto's most popular street artists. In November 2018, her painting \"Two Thousand Five\", since sold, was featured in Attitude Magazine's \"Talk to Me in Flowers\" section. == Exhibitions == * \"Tension\", 2018, The Vintage Dept., Porto * \"Between Heart and Heaven\", 2018, (group show with Hazul and Godmess) DaVinci, Porto * \"The Studio\", 2014 Filmbase, Dublin * \"An Exhibition of Prints & Drawings\", 2014 The White Lady Gallery, Dublin * \"JTB\", 2012 The Yellow Box, Dublin == Scarves == In 2016, BerriBlue launched a line of illustrated silk scarves with designs based on her work. Rather than merchandise, she considers them to be an extension of her artwork. She decided to create this line because her mother, who grew up in India, always had silk scarves and she considers them \"magical\" sentimental objects. In 2019, online retailer Wolf & Badger began stocking BerriBlue scarves. == References == == External links == * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the National College of Art and Design Category:Artists from Gda\u0144sk Category:Polish contemporary artists Category:Portuguese women painters Category:Polish women painters Category:Portuguese fashion designers Category:Polish fashion designers Category:Pseudonymous artists Category:Street artists Category:Polish emigrants to Ireland Category:Polish emigrants to Portugal Category:Artists from Porto ",
