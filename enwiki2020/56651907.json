The building features a date stone above the door which states that it was built in 1658 as well as the initials TGN, which is said to have stood for Thomas Godfrey Newbould, a prominent Quaker and landlord. The building overlooks the village stocks as well as the cross. Although it has largely been used as a public house since its completion, in more recent years it has been used to house various restaurants.
