    "text": "The RD-0110R (GRAU Index 14D24) is a rocket engine burning liquid oxygen and kerosene in a gas generator combustion cycle. It has four nozzles that can gimbal up to 45 degrees in a single axis and is used as the vernier thruster on the Soyuz-2-1v first stage. It also has heat exchangers that heat oxygen and helium to pressurize the LOX and RG-1 tanks of the Soyuz-2.1v first stage, respectively. The oxygen is supplied from the same LOX tank in liquid form, while the helium is supplied from separate high pressure bottles (known as the T tank). The engine's development started in 2010 and it is a heavily modified version of the RD-0110. The main areas of work were shortening the nozzles to optimize them for the atmospheric part of the flight (the RD-0110 is a vacuum optimized engine), propellant piping, heat exchangers and the gimballing system, which was developed by TsSKB Progress. The RD-0110R engine is produced at the Voronezh Mechanical Plant. ==See also== *Soyuz-2-1v - The first rocket to use the RD-0110R *KBKhA - The RD-0110R designer bureau *RSC Progress - The designer of the Soyuz-2.1v and the RD-0110R nozzle gimbal *Voronezh Mechanical Plant - A space hardware manufacturer company that manufactures the RD-0110R ==References== ==External links== * KbKhA Home Page * Voronezh Mechanical Plant * RSC Progress Home Page Category:Rocket engines of Russia Category:Rocket engines of the Soviet Union Category:Rocket engines using kerosene propellant Category:Rocket engines using the gas-generator cycle Category:KBKhA rocket engines ",
