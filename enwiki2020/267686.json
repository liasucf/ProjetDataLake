The University of Saskatchewan (U of S) is a Canadian public research university, founded on March 19, 1907, and located on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. An \"Act to establish and incorporate a University for the Province of Saskatchewan\" was passed by the provincial legislature in 1907. It established the provincial university on March 19, 1907 \"for the purpose of providing facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage\". The University of Saskatchewan is the largest education institution in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan is one of Canada\u2019s top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs) and is a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (the 15 most research- intensive universities in Canada). The university began as an agricultural college in 1907 and established the first Canadian university-based department of extension in 1910. There were set aside for university buildings and for the U of S farm, and agricultural fields. In total was annexed for the university. The main University campus is situated upon , with another allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to neighbouring urban research lands. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals. The University is also home to the Canadian Light Source synchrotron, which is considered one of the largest and most innovative investments in Canadian science. Since its origins as an agricultural college, research has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the cobalt-60 cancer therapy unit. The university offers over 200 academic programs. Duncan P. McColl was appointed as the first registrar, establishing the first convocation from which Chief Justice Edward L. Wetmore was elected as the first chancellor. Walter Charles Murray became the first president of the university's board of governors. ==History== ===Beginnings=== The eastern fa\u00e7ade of the Academic Health Sciences Building prior to the construction of the D Wing The institution was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, was granted a provincial charter on March 19, 1907. A provincial statute known as the University Act. It provided for a publicly funded, yet independent institution to be created for the citizens of the whole province. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The scope of the new institution was to include colleges of arts and science, including art, music and commerce, agriculture with forestry, domestic science, education, engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary science and dentistry. Saskatoon was chosen as the site for the University on April 7, 1909 by the board of governors. On October 12, 1912 the first building opened its doors for student admission. It awarded its first degrees in 1912. In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. Battleford, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina, and Saskatoon all lobbied to be the location of the new university. Walter Murray preferred the provincial capital, Regina. In a politically influenced vote, Saskatoon was chosen on April 7, 1909. Plaque commemorating World War I veterans: \"1914\u20131918 In Memory of All Ranks of the 46th Battalion C.E.F. They are too near to be great, but our children shall understand when and how our fate was changed, and by whose hand.\" Designed by David Robertson Brown (architect), the Memorial Gates were erected in 1927 at the corner of College Drive and Hospital Drive in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the First World War. A stone wall bears inscriptions of the names of the sixty seven university students and faculty who lost their lives while on service during World War I. The hallways of the Old Administrative Building (College Building) at the University of Saskatchewan are decorated with memorial scrolls in honour of the University of Saskatchewan alumni who served in the World Wars. The National Film Board of Canada documentary \"Prairie University\" (1955) directed by John Feeney explores diverse research activities at the University of Saskatchewan on agriculture, medicine, and ice cream. A college of veterinary medicine opened at the University of Saskatchewan on July 2, 1969. The University of Saskatchewan's Arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 15, 2001. ===Campus=== Nobel Plaza, University of Saskatchewan A location next to the South Saskatchewan River, across from the city centre of Saskatoon, was selected for the campus. David Robertson Brown of Brown & Vallance were the initial architects constructing a campus plan and the first university buildings in Collegiate Gothic style: The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, laid the cornerstone of the first building, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the College Building, built 1910\u20131912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada. Brown & Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910\u201312); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910\u201312). Brown & Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910\u201312) as well as additions 1913 in 1920 and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown & Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910\u201312) and Emmanuel College (1910\u201312). Brown & Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911\u201312) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown & Vallance constructed the President's Residence (1911\u201313) Qu'Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914\u201316) Physics Building (1919\u201321); Chemistry Building (1922\u201323); St. Andrew's Presbyterian College (1922\u201323); Memorial Gates (1927\u201328) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929). The original buildings were built using native limestone \u2013 greystone \u2013 which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, this greystone became one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall stone, which is quarried in Manitoba. Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott. The Bowl, a green space on the University of Saskatchewan main campus, as seen today The original architectural plan called for the university buildings to be constructed around a green space known as The Bowl. The original university buildings are now connected by skywalks and tunnels. Clockwise, from the north; Thorvaldson Building (August 22, 1924) (Spinks addition); Geology, W.P. Thompson Biology (1960) adjoined to Physics Building (1921); College Building (May 1, 1913) (Administration addition); Saskatchewan cojoined with Athabasca Hall (1964); Qu'Appelle Hall (1916); Marquis Hall adjoined to Place Riel \u2013 Qu'Appelle Addition; Murray Memorial Main Library (1956); Arts (1960) cojoined with Law and adjoined to Commerce building complete the initial circle around the perimeter of the bowl. Francis Henry Portnall and Frank Martin designed the Dairy & Soils Laboratory (1947). ===Establishment of colleges=== Entrance to Thorvaldson Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan Roughly adhering to the original plan of 1909, numerous colleges were established: Arts & Science (1909); Agriculture, now called Agriculture and Bioresources (1912); Engineering (1912); Law (1913); Pharmacy, now called Pharmacy & Nutrition (1914); Commerce, now the N. Murray Edwards School of Business (1917); Medicine (1926); Education (1927); Home Economics (1928); Nursing (1938); Graduate Studies and Research (1946); Physical Education, now called Kinesiology (1958); Veterinary Medicine (1964); Dentistry (1965); and the School of Physical Therapy (1976). The U of S also has several graduate programs amongst these colleges, which give rise to a masters or doctorate degree. In 1966, the University of Saskatchewan introduced a masters program in adult education. Diploma, and certificate post secondary courses are also available to aid in professional development. Entrance to the Anthropology & Archaeology Building of the University of Saskatchewan Theological Colleges, affiliated with the university, were also established: Emmanuel College \u2013 (Anglican denomination) (1909), St. Andrew's College (as Presbyterian College, Saskatoon) then United Church of Canada (1913), Lutheran Theological Seminary (1920), St. Thomas More College (1936), and Central Pentecostal College (1983).University of Saskatchewan Regina College was saved from bankruptcy and became part of the university in 1934, and was given degree-granting privileges in 1959, making it a second University of Saskatchewan campus. By another act of legislation in 1974, Regina College was made an independent institution known as the University of Regina. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. Correspondence courses were established in 1929. Other federated and affiliated colleges include Briercrest Bible College and Biblical Seminary in Caronport, Saskatchewan; Gabriel Dumont College and St. Peter's Historic Junior College in Muenster, Saskatchewan. Engineering Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan ===Later development=== In the late 1990s, the U of S launched a major revitalisation program, comprising new capital projects such as an expansion to the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, the building of a new parkade, and a revision of its internal road layout (which has already seen the East Road access being realigned). The Thorvaldson Building, which is home to the departments of chemistry and computer science, hosts a new expansion known as the Spinks addition. The College of Pharmacy and Nutrition has also had a number of renovations. ===Land holdings=== Up until the late 1980s, the University of Saskatchewan held an extensive area of land in the northeast quadrant of Saskatoon, stretching far beyond the core campus, east of Preston Avenue and north of the Sutherland and Forest Grove subdivisions. Much of this land was used for farming, though some areas were intended for future campus and facility development. In the late 1980s, most U of S land beyond Circle Drive was earmarked for residential development; Silverspring was the first of these neighbourhoods to be developed. The Royal University Hospital (1955 Wing) Another section of land, west of the Preston Avenue/Circle Drive interchange and north of the Canadian Pacific Railway line, was zoned for commercial use, and led to \"big box\" retail development in the early 2000s called Preston Crossing. Realignment of two major roads in the area around this same time (Preston Avenue and 108th Street) also used up a portion of university land. The U of S obtained a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land (this land has since been itself annexed into the city). The U of S leased a site to the Correctional Service of Canada north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Drive. In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the \"green belt\" offered by the university led to these plans being dropped. The city has refrained from indicating any residential development plans for the newer land holdings in the northeast, allowing another green belt to be created separating the new communities of Evergreen and Aspen Ridge from other parts of the city. ==Rankings== The University of Saskatchewan has placed in post-secondary school rankings. In the 2020 Academic Ranking of World Universities rankings, the university ranked 301\u2013400 in the world and 13\u201318 in Canada. The 2021 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university 401\u2013500 in the world, and 17\u201318 in Canada. The 2021 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 465th in the world and sixteenth in Canada. In U.S. News & World Report 2021 global university rankings, the university placed 538th in the world, and 20th in Canada. In Maclean's 2021 ranking of Canadian universities, the university placed 15th in their medical- doctoral university category. The College of Engineering competes internationally through the University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team, which saw multiple first finishes at the X-Prize Foundation NASA challenges. The team was composed of undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and researchers drawn from across multiple disciplines. These finishes included world records in wireless energy transfer and space robotics technologies with features on Discovery Channel. The National Post and Financial Post \"Top 500\" ranking of Universities places the U of S 13th of the top 20 Canadian Universities with a population of 15,397 and revenue of $566,596,000. The Sidhpur Foundation places the University of Saskatchewan at spot 14 out of the top 25 universities in Canada. The Gourman Report Ranking of Canadian Universities gave the U of S a score of 3.28, which places it at spot 20 out of 60 Canadian Universities. The Globe and Mail's University Report Card reflects the opinions of 25,000 current undergraduates who responded to some 100 questions about their respective universities.

In addition, the University's affiliated colleges and Centre for Continuing and Distance Education offer degree programs, certificates, and training programs. Many affiliated colleges allow students to complete the first two years of a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree, and some offer full degrees in Education, Native Studies, and Theology. ==Students and alumni== Ukrainian poet Lesya Ukrainka The University Act provided that the University should provide \"facilities for higher education in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage\". It further stated that \"no woman shall by reason of her sex be deprived of any advantage or privilege accorded to the male students of the university.\" Seventy students began the first classes on September 28, 1909. The first class graduated on May 1, 1912. Of the three students who earned graduation honours, two were women. 342 students, faculty, and staff enlisted for World War I. Of these, 67 were killed, 100 were wounded, and 33 were awarded medals of valour. Between 1907 and 2007 there have been over 132,200 members of the University of Saskatchewan Alumni Association. The alumni feature those who have successfully graduated from a degree, certificate and/or diploma programme at the University of Saskatchewan. ===Notable faculty and researchers=== * Ken Coates (1956- ), historian, Canada Research Chair in Regional Innovation, Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy and Director of the International Centre for Northern Governance and Development * Sylvia Fedoruk, University Chancellor, Professor in Oncology, Associate Member in Physics, and Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan (1988\u20131994) * Paul Finkelman (1949- ), historian and legal scholar, Ariel F.

In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female chancellor of the university, Sylvia Fedoruk, was a member of the cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's lieutenant-governor from 1988 to 1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus. The University used the SCR-270 radar in 1949 to image the Aurora for the first time. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and is the size of a football field. The university also is home to the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Innovation Place Research Park is an industrial science and technology park that hosts private industry working with the university. Apart from what goes on in these research facilities, the rank-and-file faculty are highly productive on the whole, across all the colleges and schools. Many faculty members have national and international scholarly reputations second to none. Consequently, they are magnets to Canadian and overseas graduate students and researchers. ==University administration and governance== The University of Saskatchewan has a tricameral governance structure, defined by the University of Saskatchewan Act, consisting of a Board of Governors, University Council, and Senate, as well as the General Academic Assembly. Financial, management, as well as administration affairs are handled by the Board of Governors, which comprises 11 members. The University of Saskatchewan liaison between the public and professional sector is dealt with by the university Senate, a body of 100 representatives. Finally, University Council is made up of a combination of 116 faculty and students. Council is the University's academic governing body, responsible for \"overseeing and directing the University's academic affairs.\" The General Academic Assembly consists of all faculty members and elected students. As of 2006, faculty and staff total 7,000, and student enrolment comprised 15,005 full-time students as well as 3,552 part-time students. In October 2008, the University of Saskatchewan was named one of Saskatchewan's Top Employers, which was announced by the Saskatoon StarPhoenix and Regina Leader-Post newspapers. The University senior administration consists of Chancellor Grit McCreath, the President and Vice-Chancellor (Professor Peter Stoicheff); the Provost and Vice-President Academic (Professor Anthony Vannelli); Greg Fowler, Vice-President (Finance & Resources); and Professor Karen Chad, Vice-President (Research). ===University presidents=== The past 100+ years have seen 11 university presidents beginning with Walter Charles Murray (1908\u201337) who helped establish and set the groundwork for the University of Saskatchewan. In other words, > to make a University where no University existed. James Sutherland Thomson (1937\u201349) was the second president > during some of the most difficult years in the institution's history. His > term spanned the final years of the Great Depression, the Second World War, > and the hectic, early post-war years. Walter Palmer Thompson presidency term (1949\u201359) spanned the university's 50th anniversary year. Dr. Walter Murray said to him > \"Do not be appalled at the absence of all you have been accustomed to find > in other Universities. We have all had to start with nothing.. .You have > virgin soil to break.\" In many fields Biologist Walter P. Thompson leadership brought innovation, insight and research to new areas beginning with rust resistant varieties of wheat which curtailed the 1916 catastrophic outbreak of rust. He also was instrumental in developing in Saskatchewan a comprehensive medicare program. His popularity and qualities of administrator and teacher served the U of S well during his presidency. The fourth and youngest Canadian university president, John William Tranter Spinks (1959\u201374) brought in a whirlwind era for the university. > ...enrolment sky rocketed, a new campus was opened, new buildings were > erected, new colleges and schools were started and course offerings were > increased. This included a comprehensive health care complex, establishment > of a Crop Development Centre, a Linear Accelerator Laboratory, SED Systems, > an Institute for Northern Studies, and an Indian and Northern Education > Program. Robert William Begg (1974\u201380) became the fifth U of S president, who received the Order of Canada during his term in office > for his distinguished career in education and for his contributions to > cancer research. The sixth president was Leo Friman Kristjanson (1980\u201389) who served a foreshortened term due to the onset of Parkinson's disease. However, even during this tenure from which he left early, the University saw the addition of the Innovation Place research park, Geology Building, Kinsmen Children's Centre, The Centre for the Study of Co-operatives, a new Saskatoon Cancer Clinic, expansion of health science facilities, the Rt. Hon. John G. Diefenbaker Centre, and the groundwork was laid for the new agriculture building. The seventh university president was George Ivany (1989\u201399). > The J.W. George Ivany Internationalization Award, to be presented annually, > was established in 1998 to acknowledge Dr. Ivany's \"commitment to > internationalization and his leadership in fulfillment of that commitment\". The eighth president of the University of Saskatchewan was Professor R. Peter MacKinnon (1999\u20132012).

She was removed from office by the Board of Governors on May 21, 2014, in the aftermath of the temporary firing of the executive director of the School of Public Policy. The 10th president of the University of Saskatchewan is Dr. Gordon Barnhart (2014\u2013 2015). Barnhart served as Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan from 2006 to 2012 and is the first former holder of that office to serve as president of the U of S. He was appointed in an interim capacity by the Board of Governors on May 21, 2014. The 11th and current present of the University of Saskatchewan is Professor Peter Stoicheff (2015-). Professor Stoicheff served as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 2011-2015 and as Vice-Dean for the Division of Humanities and Fine arts in the College of Arts and Science from 2005\u20132010. Professor Stoicheff joined the University in 1986 as a faculty member of the English department. ===University chancellors=== The University of Saskatchewan chancellor would have the duties to preside over convocation ceremonies whereupon they would confer degrees, they chair the Senate and become members of the Board of Governors. The first University of Saskatchewan chancellor was Justice Edward Ludlow Wetmore B.A. (1909\u20131917). The University of Saskatchewan Board of Governors honoured him with an honorary D.C.L., in recognition of the contributions Edward Wetmore gave to > both (the province and country) [which] enjoy in rich measure the results of > his great common sense, his judiciousness and his high sense of public duty > in shaping those fundamental traditions which give character and direction > to the activities of two of the most influential institutions of the State, > the judiciary and the University.
