    "text": "The G1 Climax 29 was a professional wrestling tournament promoted by the Japan-based New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). The tournament commenced on July 6 and concluded on August 12, 2019. It is the twenty-ninth edition of G1 Climax, and forty-fifth edition of the tournament counting its previous forms under different names. A Block winner Kota Ibushi defeated B Block winner Jay White in the final to win the tournament. Considered NJPW's most important tournament, the G1 Climax features twenty wrestlers, divided in two blocks of ten (\"A\" and \"B\"). Each participant faces all nine other wrestlers within the same block in singles matches. The winner of each block is determined via a point system, with two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no point for a defeat; each night of the event sees the ten members of one block compete for the tournament, while the members of the non-competing block perform in tag team matches that have no influence of the tournament results. On the final day of the event, the winners of both blocks face each other to determine the winner of the G1 Climax, who will gain a future match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom, NJPW's biggest yearly event. The event saw the G1 Climax debut of Jeff Cobb, Jon Moxley, Taichi, Kenta, Shingo Takagi, and Will Ospreay as well as Lance Archer's first participation since 2014; this was Kenta's in-ring debut in NJPW. As usual, the tournament took place over several cities and locations; the 2019 edition marked the first time that the G1 Climax tournament took place outside of Japan, as the event opened with G1 Climax in Dallas at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, before moving back to Japan. The event was broadcast live on AXS TV in the United States, TV Asahi and Fighting TV Samurai in Japan, and New Japan Pro-Wrestling World worldwide. == Production == {|class=wikitable style=\"font- size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\" |+ Other on- screen personnel !|Role: !|Name: |- |rowspan=3|English Commentators |Kevin Kelly |- |Rocky Romero |- |Chris Charlton (nights 2, 3, 5\u25007, 13, 14, 16\u250019) |- |rowspan=12|Japanese Commentators |Shinpei Nogami (nights 18 & 19) |- |Shigeki Kiyono (nights 2, 3, 8\u250010) |- |Yohei Onishi (nights 1 & 4) |- |Shunichiro Fujisawa (nights 5\u25007, 12, 15) |- |Haruo Murata (nights 11, 13, 14, 16) |- |Shinji Yoshino (night 17) |- |Milano Collection A.T. |- |Miki Motoi (nights 1, 3, 5, 15, 18) |- |Yusuke Okamoto (nights 7 & 12) |- |Katsuhiko Kanazawa (nights 4, 6, 19) |- |Soichi Shibata (night 2) |- |Kazuo Yamazaki (night 17) |- |rowspan=2|Ring announcers |Kimihiko Ozaki |- |Makoto Abe |- |rowspan=4|Referees |Kenta Sato |- |Marty Asami |- |Red Shoes Unno |- |Tiger Hattori |- |} === Tournament rules === NJPW announced that the 2019 edition and its dates of the G1 Climax on January 4, 2019 at Wrestle Kingdom 13; it was announced that the first night of the tournament will be held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, marking the first time the tournament would be held outside of Japan. As per usual G1 Climax tradition, the tournament features twenty wrestlers, divided in two blocks of ten (\"A\" and \"B\"). Each participant faces all nine other wrestler within the same block in singles match, with the winner of each block being determined via a point system, gaining two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no point for a loss; each night of the event sees the ten members of a same block compete for the tournament, while the members of the non-competing block perform in tag team matches that have no influence of the tournament results, typically facing their future tournament opponents. In case of several wrestler sharing the top score, the results of the matches those wrestlers had when facing each others in the tournament act as tiebreaker, with the one having the most wins over the other top-scorers determining the winner of the block. On the final day of the event, the respective winners of both blocks face each other to determine the winner of the G1 Climax, who would gain a future match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, NJPW's top championship, at Wrestle Kingdom, NJPW's biggest yearly event; if the IWGP Heavyweight Champion himself wins, he gets to pick his opponent at Wrestle Kingdom. The low-card matches have a twenty-minutes time limit, while the matches of the tournament have a 30-minutes time limit (with the time limit being reached resulting in a tie); the final match between the two block winners has no time limit. === Storylines === The event includes matches that result from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portray heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was good, brutal fun to watch, but it also pointed a way forward for Moxley not just as an attraction, but rather as a brilliant and brilliantly violent wrestler.\" Many of the tournament's matches were acclaimed, with eight of them attaining a rating of five or more stars by wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer. ==References== ==External links== *G1 Climax at NJPW.co.jp Category:New Japan Pro-Wrestling tournaments Category:New Japan Pro-Wrestling shows Category:2019 in professional wrestling Category:July 2019 events in the United States Category:July 2019 events in Japan Category:August 2019 events in Japan Category:2019 in Texas Category:2019 in Japan Category:Events in Dallas Category:Events in Tokyo Category:Events in Sapporo Category:Events in Osaka Category:Professional wrestling in Texas Category:Professional wrestling in Tokyo Category:Professional wrestling in Osaka ",
