Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 30 June 1791, M\u00e9zi\u00e8res - 16 March 1841, Paris) was a physicist, mathematician who is primarily known for the Biot\u2013Savart law of electromagnetism, which he discovered together with his colleague Jean-Baptiste Biot. His main interest was in acoustics and the study of vibrating bodies. A particular interest in the violin led him to create an experimental trapezoidal model. He gave his name to the savart, a unit of measurement for musical intervals, and to Savart's wheel\u2014a device he used while investigating the range of human hearing. ==Biography== He was the son of G\u00e9rard Savart, an engineer at the military school of Metz. His brother, Nicolas, who was a student at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and an officer in the engineering corps, did work on vibration. At the military hospital at Metz, Savart studied medicine and later he went on to continue his studies at the University of Strasbourg, where he received his medical degree in 1816. Savart became a professor at Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1836 and was the co-originator of the Biot\u2013Savart law, along with Jean-Baptiste Biot. Together, they worked on the theory of magnetism and electrical currents. Their law was developed and published in 1820.A joint Biot-Savart paper \"Note sur le magn\u00e9tisme de la pile de Volta\" was published in the Annales de chemie et de physique in 1820. The Biot\u2013Savart law relates magnetic fields to the currents which are their sources. Savart also studied acoustics. He developed the Savart wheel which produces sound at specific graduated frequencies using rotating disks. F\u00e9lix Savart is the namesake of a unit of measurement for musical intervals, the savart, though it was actually invented by Joseph Sauveur (Stigler's law of eponymy). ==References== ==External links== * * Logarithmic Interval Measures Category:French physicists Category:1791 births Category:1841 deaths Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Music psychologists ",
