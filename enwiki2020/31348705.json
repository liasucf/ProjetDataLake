It was aired on Fuji TV's Sunday 9:00pm slot \"Dramatic Sunday\" in the 2011 winter drama season. ==Plot== The story is about Shing\u016b Elementary School which is beset by a lot of problems. Seichiro Naruse, a construction worker whose company closed down, suddenly becomes the principal of his old school. He must save the school from closing down. ==Cast== ===Main Cast=== * Y\u014dsuke Eguchi as Seichiro Naruse The construction company he was working in went bankrupt and he was appointed as the civilian principal of the Shing\u016b Elementary School. Having devoted 20 years in the construction industry, he has no teaching license. He takes up the job in order to keep a promise he made with his former teacher and ex-principal Takeichi. Nonetheless, he has a cheerful personality and takes positive action at every turn, and he frequently describes himself as a \"X X demon\". He was greatly appalled by the appearance and the change in his alma mater, which was struggling to change the status quo. In the last episode, Shing\u016b Elementary School narrowly avoided closing down, but at the same time, he resigned to take responsibility for the incident that was caused by Akira Hara in the school. * Hidetoshi Nishijima as Iori Kirihara He is the class teacher and curriculum coordinator for the sixth graders in Shing\u016b Elementary School. Born April 10, 1971, he graduated from the Tokyo Gakugei University. Being one of the super-primary school teachers from the District Board of Education, he has the confidence from other faculty members. The realist can compete with Naruse and they are at odds with each other. He observes the students better than any other teacher and actually knows about the situation.
