The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released one month after the final. Following the release of the full split voting by the EBU after the conclusion of the competition, it was revealed that Montenegro had placed fourteenth with the public televote and twelfth with the jury vote.
