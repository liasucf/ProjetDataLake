    "text": "The 1920-21 season was the 46th season of competitive football in England. ==Overview== The Football League Third Division is introduced, expanding the League's operational radius south of Birmingham. Cardiff City, however, as the strongest club in Wales in the era, is invited directly into the Second Division, and Grimsby Town takes its place in the new Third Division, thereby being the first club relegated to the League's third tier. Leeds United is also elected into the Second Division to replace Leeds City after its debacle. Lincoln City is not re-elected to the Second Division and thus Port Vale's Second Division place is formalized as well. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Burnley (1)||Manchester City |- |Second Division||Birmingham||Cardiff City |- |Third Division||Crystal Palace||Southampton\u2020 |- |FA Cup||Tottenham Hotspur (2)||Wolverhampton Wanderers |- |Charity Shield||West Bromwich Albion||Tottenham Hotspur |- |Home Championship|||| & |} \u2020 Not promoted Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Joe Smith (Bolton Wanderers) \u2013 38 goals Second Division *Syd Puddefoot (West Ham United) \u2013 29 goals Third Division *John Conner (Crystal Palace), Ernie Simms (Luton Town) and George Whitworth (Northampton Town) \u2013 28 goals ==References== ",
