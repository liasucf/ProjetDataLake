    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Everton F.C. season was the club's third consecutive campaign in the FA Women's Super League, the highest level of the football pyramid, having been promoted at the end of the 2017 Spring Series. Along with competing in the WSL, the club also contested two domestic cup competitions: the FA Cup and the League Cup. Ahead of the 2019\u201320 season, the team dropped Ladies from their name. Although now simply called Everton whenever possible, the club uses Everton Women in a formal capacity when necessary to avoid confusion with the men's team. On 13 March 2020, in line with the FA's response to the coronavirus pandemic, it was announced the season was temporarily suspended until at least 3 April 2020. After further postponements, the season was ultimately ended prematurely on 25 May 2020 with immediate effect. Everton sat in 7th at the time but moved ahead of Tottenham Hotspur into 6th on sporting merit after The FA Board's decision to award places on a points-per-game basis. == Squad == == Pre-season == == FA Women's Super League == Everton planned to only play their opening two home games at Haig Avenue in Southport before moving to their new Walton Hall Park site in time for their third home game, scheduled for 27 October 2019 against Brighton & Hove Albion. However, delays meant the move was postponed until February 2020. The Merseyside derby was also moved to Goodison Park, originally scheduled for 9 February although the game rearranged to March because of Storm Ciara. === Results summary === === Results by matchday === === Results === === League table === == Women's FA Cup == As a member of the top two tiers, Everton entered the FA Cup in the fourth round, beating Championship side London Bees in their opening fixture.
