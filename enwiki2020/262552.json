    "text": "Marcus Aurelius MariusMartindale, pg. 562 was emperor of the Gallic Empire in 269 following the assassination of Postumus. == Reign == According to later tradition, he was a blacksmith by trade, earning the nickname Mamurius Veturius, a legendary metalworker in the time of Numa.Historia Augusta, Tyranni Triginta, 8:1; Thomas Habinek, The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 25. He rose through the ranks of the Roman army to become an officer.Martindale, pg. 562 He was present with the army that revolted at Moguntiacum (Mainz) after the emperor Postumus refused to allow it to sack the city.Southern, pg. 118 They murdered the emperor and in the confusion that followed, the army elected Marius to succeed Postumus.Potter, pg. 266 His first decision was in all likelihood to allow his troops to sack the city of Moguntiacum.Polfer, Marius Seeking to solidify his power base, he then moved to Augusta Treverorum (Trier).Polfer, Marius His reign lasted no more than two or three months before Postumus\u2019 praetorian prefect Victorinus had Marius killed in the middle of 269, most likely at Augusta Treverorum.Polfer, Marius; Potter, pg. 266 According to the ancient written sources, Marius\u2019 reign lasted for two or three days only, before being killed by a sword of his own manufacture.Historia Augusta, Tyranni Triginta, 8:1-2; Eutropius, 9:2; Victor, Liber de Caesaribus, 33:11-12 This tradition is probably partially or entirely incorrect. Based upon the number of coins he issued, a more accurate length for his reign would be at least two or three months.Polfer, Marius; Martindale, pg. 562 Marius is listed among the Thirty Tyrants in the Historia Augusta. It is said that he was chosen because his names were evocative of two great Romans of the Past, Marcus Aurelius and Gaius Marius.Polfer, Marius == References == ==Sources== ===Primary sources=== * Aurelius Victor, Epitome de Caesaribus * Aurelius Victor, Liber de Caesaribus * Eutropius, Brevarium, Book 9 * Historia Augusta, Tyranni_XXX*.html The Thirty Tyrants ===Secondary sources=== * Southern, Pat.
