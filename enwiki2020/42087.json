    "text": "The Aon Center (200 East Randolph Street, formerly Amoco Building) is a modern supertall skyscraper just east of the Chicago Loop, Chicago, Illinois, United States, designed by architect firms Edward Durell Stone and The Perkins and Will partnership, and completed in 1974 as the Standard Oil Building. With 83 floors and a height of 1,136 feet (346 m), it is the fourth-tallest building in Chicago, surpassed in height by Willis Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Vista Tower. The building is managed by Jones Lang LaSalle, which is also headquartered in the building. Aon Center formerly housed the world headquarters of Aon and Amoco. Aon still maintains headquarters of its US operations there.\"Contacts\". Amoco. February 12, 1998. Retrieved on March 31, 2010. The building is also the co-headquarters of Kraft Heinz. ==History== ===Construction=== The Standard Oil Building was constructed as the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, which had previously been housed at South Michigan Avenue and East 9th Street. When it was completed in 1973, it was the tallest building in Chicago and the fourth-tallest in the world, earning it the nickname \"Big Stan\". (A year later, the Sears Tower took the title as Chicago's and world's tallest.) The building employs a tubular steel-framed structural system with V-shaped perimeter columns to resist earthquakes, reduce sway, minimize column bending, and maximize column-free space. This construction method was also used for the former World Trade Center towers in New York City. ===Refacing=== When completed, it was the world's tallest marble-clad building, sheathed entirely with 43,000 slabs of Italian Carrara marble. The marble used was thinner than previously attempted in cladding a building, which soon proved to be a mistake. On December 25, 1973, during construction a 350-pound marble slab detached from the fa\u00e7ade and penetrated the roof of the nearby Prudential Center.Chicago Tribune, December 26, 1973 In 1985, inspection found numerous cracks and bowing in the marble cladding of the building. To alleviate the problem, stainless steel straps were added to hold the marble in place. Later, from 1990 to 1992, the entire building was refaced with Mount Airy white granite at an estimated cost of over $80 million. Amoco was reluctant to divulge the actual amount, but it was well over half the original price of the building, without adjustment for inflation. Two-thirds of the discarded marble was crushed and used as landscaping decoration at Amoco's refinery in Whiting, Indiana, one-sixth was donated to Governors State University, in University Park, and one-sixth donated to Regalo, a division of Lashcon Inc. Under a grant from the Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services, Regalo's 25 handicapped workers carved the discarded marble into a variety of specialty items such as corporate gifts and mementos including desk clocks and pen holders. The building's facade somewhat resembles the former World Trade Center due to the upward flow of the columns. ===Designation=== The Standard Oil Building was renamed the Amoco Building when the company changed names in 1985. In 1998, Amoco sold the building to The Blackstone Group for an undisclosed amount, estimated to be between $430 and $440 million. It was renamed as the Aon Center on December 30, 1999, although the Aon Corporation would not become the building's primary tenant until September 2001. In May 2003, Wells Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. acquired the building for between $465 and $475 million. On August 10, 2007, Wells Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. changed its name to Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.) Real estate investors Mark Karasick and Victor Gerstein acquired the building from Piedmont in 2015 for $713 million. ===Planned observation deck=== On May 14, 2018 the owners unveiled $185 million proposal for an observatory featuring a thrill ride on the roof called the Sky Summit, the world\u2019s tallest exterior elevator, and new entrance pavilion. ==Exterior lighting== In recent years, the top floors of the building have been lit at night with colors to reflect a particular season or holiday. Orange is used for Thanksgiving, green or red for Christmas, and pink during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The lighting commonly matches the nighttime lighting on the antenna of Willis Tower, the John Hancock Center and the upper floors of the Merchandise Mart. ==Plaza== In the plaza, there is a sounding sculpture by Harry Bertoia. ==Position in Chicago's skyline== ==Gallery== File:Aon Center in Chicago May 2016.jpg|From the south File:Aon center.JPG|From the southwest File:2004-07-14 1880x2820 chicago aon looking up.jpg|Looking up the building from the ground File:Skyscrapers in Chicago, including the AON Center, Chicago, IL 11-22-15.jpg|Looking from the North, with Aqua visible ==See also== * Aon Center (Los Angeles) * First Canadian Place \u2013 a similar building from the same architect * List of buildings * List of skyscrapers * List of tallest buildings and structures in the world * List of tallest buildings in Chicago * List of tallest buildings in the United States * List of tallest freestanding structures in the world * List of tallest freestanding steel structures == References == ==External links== * Aon Center on CTBUH Skyscraper Center * List of tenants at the Aon Center - Companies located at 200 East Randolph Street, Chicago IL Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Chicago Category:Insurance company headquarters in the United States Category:Amoco Category:BP buildings and structures Category:Office buildings completed in 1973 Category:Edward Durell Stone buildings Category:JLL (company) Category:International style architecture in Illinois Category:Modernist architecture in Illinois ",
