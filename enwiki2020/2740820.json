The name and theme derive from Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 Victorian gothic novel Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. == Background == The Jekyll & Hyde restaurants' theme is spooky horror with an emphasis on English Gothic themes, with detailed decorations, set pieces, and actors who roam the restaurant and entertain patrons. Characters include Mr. Aloysius Goole, the wacky chief mortician, Jervis, the hyperactive and high-pitched French butler, charmingly manic Gertrude K. Boom, club demolitions expert, and club spokesperson Dr. Brain. These characters are the guest's link to all of the details of the club's history, and perform membership inductions table side. In addition to the live characters, there are a number of animatronic props, sounds, and special effects which contribute to the overall atmosphere of the club. The animatronic creatures (either pre-recorded or voiced live by the same actors that walk about the restaurant) animate periodically to entertain the guests and wish happy birthdays.Former alt= In addition to its original Greenwich Village location, on 7th Avenue near Bleecker Street, Jekyll and Hyde also operated a larger location on the Avenue of the Americas in Midtown near 57th street. This branch closed and moved to 44th Street, near Times Square in March 2012, which also closed March 2015. The Sixth Avenue facade continued to stand long after its closing, up to its demolition at around 2015. Other locations had been opened in Chicago and Grapevine, Texas (near DFW Airport), but closed due to poor business and the high operating costs of the restaurant.alt= The Jekyll and Hyde Entertainment Group also operate the nearby Slaughtered Lamb Pub on West 4th Street (based on the movie American Werewolf in London), and the Bayville Adventure Park on Long Island. == In popular culture == In the 12th episode of the first season of reality show The Girls Next Door, Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends are shown having dinner at one of the Jekyll & Hyde restaurants.
