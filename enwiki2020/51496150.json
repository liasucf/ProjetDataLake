Cinema Canada, September 1983. It is most noted for production problems which led to it becoming one of the first Canadian films ever to be released direct to video,\"New film premieres on video\". Ottawa Citizen, February 22, 1986. and led to a court case over production funding which was not resolved until 1995.\"Tele-Metropole ordered to pay $8 million for film fiasco\". Montreal Gazette, May 27, 1995. Based on Laird Koenig's novel The Neighbor, the film's plot centres on the girlfriend of a murdered man, who falls in love with her boyfriend's killer. ==Production== The film was originally announced with the working title Neighbor, and was originally slated to star Peter O'Toole in the role that Segal ultimately played. Due to cost overruns, however, producer Claude L\u00e9ger approached T\u00e9l\u00e9- M\u00e9tropole and the Dutch firm Mueller International as guarantors for a $3.15 million loan from the Mercantile Bank of Canada. When a dispute emerged over story rights, Mercantile Bank called in the loan, bankrupting L\u00e9ger.\"Tele- Metropole ordered to pay bank for film deal that became a legal fight\". Montreal Gazette, June 2, 1989. Mercantile Bank then sued T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole and Mueller International to recover its costs, and gave the film a minimal theatrical run under the title The Man in 5A, before selling it to Palan Entertainment for $480,000. In 1989, the Quebec Superior Court ordered T\u00e9l\u00e9- M\u00e9tropole to pay $4.6 million to the National Bank of Canada, which had by this time acquired the Mercantile Bank. T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole appealed the decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which upheld the decision in 1995; with compound interest, however, T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole was now ordered to pay $8 million. Screenwriter Leila Basen acknowledged in good humor that she had written what was widely considered \"the worst Canadian movie ever made\".\"TV scripts earn living for `housewife'\". Montreal Gazette, September 8, 1991. According to Basen, however, \"at least the script for The Man in 5A was good. The problem was that the producers ran out of money. I paid to see the movie at a theatre - and asked for my money back at the end.\" ==Awards== Campbell received a Genie Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 4th Genie Awards in 1983.\"Top Genie prospects for Bill Miner movie\". The Globe and Mail, February 10, 1983. Writing for Cinema Canada, critic J. Paul Costabile stated that the nomination had been given \"for no discernible reason\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian thriller films Category:Canadian direct-to-video films ",
