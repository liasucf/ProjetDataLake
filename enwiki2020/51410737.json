Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. == Delegation == The country sent a team of 2 athletes, both women, to the 2016 Summer Paralympics. == Powerlifting== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Result !Rank |- align=center |align=left|Greta Vardanyan |align=left|Women's \u221255 kg |96 |5 |} == Swimming== ;Women {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heats !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |- align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Maga Hovakimyan |align=left|50 m freestyle S6 |46.82 |20 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|100 m breaststroke SB5 | 2:22.57 | 13 |colspan=2|Did not advance |} == See also == *Armenia at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Category:2016 in Armenian sport ",
