    "text": "Hammatoceratidae is a family of lower and middle Jurassic ammonites included in the superfamily Hildoceratoidea. ==Diagnosis== Hammatoceratidae comprises genera which are characterized by ribbed evolute shells (all whorls visible), some bearing keels along the venter. Those in the Phymatoceratinae have more simple ribbing while those in the Hammatoceratinae have ribbing that branch higher up on the whorl sides, divided into primaries and secondaries. ==Taxonomy== In the outdated classification of the 1957 American Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Hammatoceratidae was included in the superfamily Hildoceratoidea and divided into two subfamilies, the earlier Phymatoceratinae, and later Hammatoceratinae.W.J.Arkell et al., 1957. Mesozoic Ammonoidea. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part L Hammatoceratidae is now divided into four subfamilies,Hammatoceratidae in Fossilworks the Hammatoceratinae, Erycitinae, Podagrosiceratinae, and Zurcheriinae. Hammatoceratinae includes Bredyia, Crestaites, Erycitoides, Euaptetoceras, Eudmetoceras, Fissilobiceras, Hammatoceras, Onychoceras, Paviatites, Planammatoceras, Pseudaptetoceras, and Puchenquia. Fissilobiceras, included in the Sonniniidae in the Treatise, 1957, differs from typical hammatoceratids in being rather involude and smooth shelled. The Erycitinae is said to include Erycites, Abbasotes, and Cagliceras. The Treatise Part L, 1957, includes Erycites and Abbasotes in the Hammatoceratinae. Cagliceras, named by Rulleau and Elmi, was added in 2001. Podagrosiceratinae named by Westermann and Riccardi, 1979, includes Podagrosiceras Maubeuge and Lambert, 1956, Sphaerocoeloceras, and Westermanniceras. D.T. Donovan, et al.,1981.Classification of the Jurassic Ammonitina, in The Ammonoidea, M.R House & J.R. Senior, (eds), Academic Press recognized Spaerocoaeloceras as a hammatoceratid rather than a dactyloceratid as in the Treatise. Zurcheriinae, Hyatt 1900, includes Zurcheria, H.Douville, 1885, Haplopleuroceras, Malladaites, and Spinammatoceras. Zurcheria and Haploleuroceras are included in the Sonniniidae in the Treatise Part L. ==Evolution and Phylogeny== The Hammatoceratidae with its four subfamilies has its origin in the Phymatoceratidae, with the subfamily Hammatoceratinae giving rise to the subfamilies Erycitinae and Podagrosiceratinae. If Zurcheria and Haploleurocesas belong in the Sonniniidae, the Zurcheriinae must thereby be derived and therefore belongs to the Sonniniidae. ==References== Category:Ammonitida families Category:Hildoceratoidea Category:Jurassic ammonites Category:Early Jurassic first appearances Category:Middle Jurassic extinctions ",
