    "text": "On three occasions in New York history, some members of the United States House of Representatives were elected statewide at-large. This was due to an increase of the number of representatives after the previous federal census, and the failure of the State Legislature to re-apportion the congressional districts in time for the next election. In 1872 and 1882, one representative each was elected for the ensuing term. The Legislature then re-apportioned the congressional districts before the elections in 1874 and 1884. From 1933 to 1945, two representatives elected at-large sat in the House because the Legislature could not agree on a re-apportionment of the districts. For the election to the 79th United States Congress, which was held in 1944, the congressional districts were finally re-apportioned. == List of members representing the district == === 1873\u20131875: One seat === New York gained one seat following the 1870 Census. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" !
