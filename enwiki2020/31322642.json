    "text": "The 1981\u201382 Yugoslav Cup was the 34th season of the top football knockout competition in SFR Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Cup (), also known as the \"Marshal Tito Cup\" (Kup Mar\u0161ala Tita), since its establishment in 1946. The 1980\u201381 winners Vele\u017e failed to retain the trophy as they were knocked out in the first round by minnows Mogren. Dinamo Zagreb and the Belgrade-based Red Star, who finished as winners and runners-up in the 1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League, reached the tournament final. In the two-legged final Red Star won their 10th cup title after beating Dinamo 6\u20134 on aggregate. This was their first cup win since the 1970\u201371 edition. Surprise of the tournament were second level side Galenika, who managed to reach the semi-finals, knocking out the remaining two of the Yugoslav \"Big Four\" clubs Partizan and Hajduk Split in the process. Fuelled by their prolific goalscorer Slobodan Santra\u010d, Galenika also had a successful league season as they won the 1981\u201382 Second League Division East and won promotion to the 1982\u201383 Yugoslav First League. ==Calendar== The Yugoslav Cup was a tournament for which clubs from all tiers of the football pyramid were eligible to enter. In addition, amateur teams put together by individual Yugoslav People's Army garrisons and various factories and industrial plants were also encouraged to enter, which meant that each cup edition could have several thousands of teams in its preliminary stages. These teams would play through a number of qualifying rounds before reaching the first round proper, in which they would be paired with top-flight teams. The cup final was played over two legs on 16 and 23 May, traditionally scheduled to coincide with Youth Day celebrated on 25 May, a national holiday in Yugoslavia which also doubled as the official commemoration of Josip Broz Tito's birthday. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" !width=200| Round !! width=60 | Legs!!width=130| Date !!width=100| Fixtures !! width=100 | Clubs |- |First round (round of 32) ||Single||align=\"center\"| 7 October 1981 ||align=\"center\"| 16 ||align=\"center\"| 32 \u2192 16 |- |Second round (round of 16) ||Single||align=\"center\"| 7 November 1981 ||align=\"center\"| 8 ||align=\"center\"| 16 \u2192 8 |- |Quarter-finals ||Single||align=\"center\"| 18 November 1981 ||align=\"center\"| 8 ||align=\"center\"| 8 \u2192 4 |- |Semi-finals ||Single||align=\"center\"| 21 April 1982 ||align=\"center\"| 4 ||align=\"center\"| 4 \u2192 2 |- |Final ||Double||align=\"center\"| 16 and 23 May 1982 ||align=\"center\"| 2 ||align=\"center\"| 2 \u2192 1 |- |} ==First round== First round proper was played on 7 October 1981. Ties were decided over a single leg, with penalty shootouts used to determine winners when matches ended in a draw after regular time. Sixteen out of eighteen 1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League clubs entered the competition at this stage (everyone except Osijek and Teteks, who were only promoted to top level at the end of the 1980\u201381 season). Each of the sixteen top level clubs were paired with a lower-tier team who made it to this stage through preliminary qualifiers. In addition, Croatia Zurich, a Zurich-based club ran by Croatian emigrants in Switzerland, also received a spot, but exited the tournament following a 5\u20130 defeat to Budu\u0107nost. Seven top level clubs were knocked out at this stage: OFK Belgrade, Partizan, Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161, Vardar, Zagreb and the defending cup winners Vele\u017e, who lost their tie to Montenegrin minnows Mogren on penalties.

Dinamo Zagreb played Sloboda at Maksimir Stadium and won 2\u20130 through goals by Snje\u0161ko Cerin and Zlatko Kranj\u010dar. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !width=40|Tie no !width=150|Home team !width=80|Score !width=150|Away team |- |1 |Red Star |4\u20131 |Galenika |- |2 |Dinamo Zagreb |2\u20130 |Sloboda |} ==Final== ===Summary=== Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star, two of the so-called Yugoslav \"Big Four\" clubs, had reached the 1982 final. The two clubs also dominated in the Yugoslav First League that season, with Dinamo crowned champions only two weeks before the first leg of the cup final, and Red Star finishing the season as runners-up. Red Star eventually won the final tie 6\u20134 on aggregate. For Red Star this was their 15th appearance in the Yugoslav Cup final and their first cup title since 1971. It was won by a squad featuring major club stars such as Vladimir Petrovi\u0107, Du\u0161an Savi\u0107, Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 and Milko \u0110urovski, led by experienced coach Branko Stankovi\u0107. For Dinamo Zagreb this was their 11th appearance in the final and a chance to win their 7th cup title. The team, led by Miroslav Bla\u017eevi\u0107, eventually failed to clinch what would have been their first Yugoslav Double, as they had won the 1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League with five points in front of Red Star. Dinamo's squad that season featured club legends such as Snje\u0161ko Cerin, Velimir Zajec, Zlatko Kranj\u010dar, Marko Mlinari\u0107 and Stjepan Deveri\u0107. Dinamo and Red Star had previously met in the cup final on three occasions, in 1950, 1964 and 1980. Red Star had won the first two finals while Dinamo picked up the 1980 cup. Before the competition would cease to exist amid the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s the two clubs would also met for the fifth time in the 1984\u201385 Yugoslav Cup final. ===Match details=== In the first leg, played on 16 May 1982 in front of 50,000 people at Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, Red Star took an early lead through a goal by Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 in the 15th minute. After the half-time break Dinamo equalized through D\u017eemal Mustedanagi\u0107 in the 49th minute and then went on to take the lead through Snje\u0161ko Cerin ten minutes later. Six minutes before the final whistle Dinamo's defender Zvjezdan Cvetkovi\u0107 tackled Zlatko Krmpoti\u0107 inside Dinamo's box, and a penalty was awarded to Red Star, which Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 successfully converted to make the final score 2\u20132. In the second leg played on 23 May 1982 in Belgrade Red Star coach Branko Stankovi\u0107 named Du\u0161an Savi\u0107 in the starting eleven. Savi\u0107, who had spent the first leg in Zagreb on the substitute bench, used runs down the right side to create several goalscoring opportunities for Rajko Janjanin and Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 very early on, but Dinamo's goalkeeper Tomislav Ivkovi\u0107 was on form and saved a couple of close- range efforts. In the 31st minute Savi\u0107 latched onto a long pass by Milan Jankovi\u0107 to make it 1\u20130. Four minutes before half-time Dinamo pulled back through Zlatko Kranj\u010dar's free kick, and minutes later Marko Mlinari\u0107 embarked on a solo run from the centre of the pitch to set up Snje\u0161ko Cerin for an easy tap-in which made it 2\u20131 for the Blues. Red Star's Ranko \u0110or\u0111i\u0107 equalized through a powerful shot from the edge of the box in the 66th minute, and seven minutes later Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 scored a goal after a long pass by Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 which tipped the result in Red Star's favour to make the aggregate score 5\u20134. Savi\u0107 added his second goal three minutes before full-time, which set the final score 4\u20132 on the day and 6\u20134 on aggregate. ===First leg=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK ||1 || Marijan Vlak || |- |DF ||2 || Petar Bru\u010di\u0107 |- |DF ||3 || Zvjezdan Cvetkovi\u0107 |- |DF ||4|| Ismet Had\u017ei\u0107 || |- |DF ||5|| Velimir Zajec |- |DF ||6 || Dragan Bo\u0161njak |- |MF ||7|| Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 |- |FW ||8|| Snje\u0161ko Cerin |- |FW ||9 || Zlatko Kranj\u010dar |- |MF ||10|| Marko Mlinari\u0107 |- |FW ||11|| Stjepan Deveri\u0107 |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |GK ||?|| Tomislav Ivkovi\u0107 || |- |FW ||?|| D\u017eemal Mustedanagi\u0107 || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Miroslav Bla\u017eevi\u0107 |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK ||1|| Dragan Simeunovi\u0107 || |- |DF ||2 || Zlatko Krmpoti\u0107 |- |DF ||3 || Zoran Mali\u0161evi\u0107 |- |DF ||4|| Bo\u0161ko \u0110urovski |- |DF ||5|| Zdravko Borovnica |- |DF ||6|| Ivan Juri\u0161i\u0107 || |- |MF ||7 || Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 |- |MF ||8|| Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 |- |FW ||9 || Ranko \u0110or\u0111i\u0107 |- |DF ||10|| Milan Jankovi\u0107 |- |MF ||11 || Milko \u0110urovski || |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |GK ||? || Aleksandar Stojanovi\u0107 || |- |MF ||? || Ljubi\u0161a Rajkovi\u0107 || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Branko Stankovi\u0107 |} |} ===Second leg=== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"|RED STAR: |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK ||1|| Aleksandar Stojanovi\u0107 |- |DF ||2 || Zlatko Krmpoti\u0107 |- |DF ||3 || Zoran Mali\u0161evi\u0107 |- |DF ||4|| Bo\u0161ko \u0110urovski |- |DF ||5|| Zdravko Borovnica |- |DF ||6|| Milan Jankovi\u0107 |- |MF ||7 || Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 |- |MF ||8|| Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 |- |FW ||9 || Du\u0161an Savi\u0107 |- |DF ||10|| Rajko Janjanin || |- |MF ||11 || Milko \u0110urovski || |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |MF ||? || Srebrenko Rep\u010di\u0107 || |- |MF ||? || Ranko \u0110or\u0111i\u0107 || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Branko Stankovi\u0107 |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |colspan=\"4\"|DINAMO ZAGREB: |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"200\"| !! |- |GK ||1 || Tomislav Ivkovi\u0107 |- |DF ||2 || Emil Dragi\u010devi\u0107 |- |DF ||3 || Zvjezdan Cvetkovi\u0107 |- |DF ||4|| Dragan Bo\u0161njak |- |DF ||5|| Velimir Zajec |- |DF ||6 || Sre\u0107ko Bogdan |- |MF ||7|| Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 |- |FW ||8|| Snje\u0161ko Cerin |- |FW ||9 || Zlatko Kranj\u010dar || |- |MF ||10|| Marko Mlinari\u0107 |- |FW ||11|| Zoran Pani\u0107 || |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |FW ||?|| \u017deljko Hohnjec || |- |FW ||?|| Drago Dumbovi\u0107 || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Miroslav Bla\u017eevi\u0107 |} |} ==Top scorers== The top goalscorers in the 1981\u201382 Yugoslav Cup (first round proper and onwards) were as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=40|Rank !width=140|Scorer !width=110|Club !width=40|Goals |- |rowspan=1 align=center|1 | Du\u0161an Savi\u0107 |Red Star |align=center|5 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|2 | Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 |Red Star |align=center|4 |- | Slobodan Santra\u010d |Galenika |align=center|4 |- |rowspan=6 align=center|4 | Predrag Pa\u0161i\u0107 |Sarajevo |align=center|3 |- | Mihajlo Petrovi\u0107 |Olimpija |align=center|3 |- | Ivan Gudelj |Hajduk Split |align=center|3 |- | Stjepan Deveri\u0107 |Dinamo Zagreb |align=center|3 |- | Snje\u0161ko Cerin |Dinamo Zagreb |align=center|3 |- | Milo\u0161 \u0160esti\u0107 |Red Star |align=center|3 |- |rowspan=4 align=center|10 | Moja\u0161 Radonji\u0107 |Budu\u0107nost |align=center|2 |- | Zoran Pani\u0107 |Dinamo Zagreb |align=center|2 |- | Zlatko Kranj\u010dar |Dinamo Zagreb |align=center|2 |- | Ranko \u0110or\u0111i\u0107 |Red Star |align=center|2 |} ==See also== *1981\u201382 Yugoslav First League *1981\u201382 Yugoslav Second League *1981\u201382 NK Dinamo Zagreb season ==External links== * * *1982 cup-winning squad at the Red Star Belgrade official website *1981\u201382 cup season details at Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation *1982 cup final details at Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation Category:Yugoslav Cup seasons Cup Yugo ",
