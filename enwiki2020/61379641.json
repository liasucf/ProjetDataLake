While studying abroad, in Germany, his interest in the work of Anton Chekhov and Afanasy Fet led him to study the Russian language and try his hand in translating. He eventually translated several of Chekhov's short stories and novellas, entitled \u010cehovjevih Pripovedaka and Ruski ljudi (both published in 1890) and Fet's poetry. He also authored several books, including a memoir that appeared in 1963 in Belgrade's newspaper Politika entitled \"A Witness to an Era.\" ==Works== * Slika i karakteri iz srpskoga dru\u0161tva (Picture and Characters from Serbian Orgnaizations); * Napuljska \u0161etnja (Neapoletan Walks), 1911; * Prica iz \u017eivota kralja Petra (Stoies from King Peter's Life), 1922; * Kralj Aleksandar I Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 u ratu i Mir (King Alexander I Karadjordjevi\u0107 in War and Peace); * Sun\u0107ana Pra\u0161ina (Sunny Dust), 1941-1944; * Svedok jednog stole\u0107a (A Witness to an Era), 1963 * Stevan Sremac (1936) * Unique item: delta novel with a hundred endings * Tvorci Srbije i Jugoslavije: Radovi Archdjakona Lukijana Bibi\u0107a akademskog slikara (1941) * Na\u0161 u ratu (1928) * Anegdote iz \u017eivota na\u0161ih knji\u017eevnika i umetnika (1953). == References == Category:1865 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Writers from Belgrade Category:20th- century Serbian writers Category:21st-century Serbian writers ",
