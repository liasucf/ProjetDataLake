    "text": "Tomblike memorial of Osric in Gloucester Cathedral, in Perpendicular Gothic, erected about 1530 Recumbent effigy Osric was a king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce in the late 7th century, perhaps reigning jointly with his presumed brother Oshere. Osric was probably a son of Eanhere, a previous King of the Hwicce, by Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. The only marriage recorded for Osthryth is that to \u00c6thelred of Mercia, but an earlier marriage to Eanhere would explain why Osric and his brother Oswald are described as \u00c6thelred's nepotes \u2014 usually translated as nephews or grandsons, but here probably meaning stepsons.John Leland, Collectanea, vol. 1, p. 240. Osric is claimed as the founder of two monastic houses, one at Bath (now Bath Abbey) and the other at Gloucester (now Gloucester Cathedral). In 676 Osric granted lands to Abbess Bertana to found a convent at Bath. The charter attesting this grant S51 has been queried on several grounds of later editing and interpolation, but probably has an authentic basis.H. P. R. Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester, 1961), pp. 172-4. The foundation charter of Gloucester Abbey survives in a medieval register of the abbey. It is not straightforward, but again is considered to have an authentic basis.H. P. R. Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester, 1961), pp. 158-61. The charter was apparently issued in the 670s by \u00c6thelred, king of Mercia, and records his grant of lands at Gloucester and Pershore to two of his thegns, noblemen of the Hwicce, Osric and his brother Oswald. Osric's share was at Gloucester, and he sought permission from \u00c6thelred to found a monastery there. The story of the abbey's foundation continues in the register with the claim that Osric granted the land for the abbey to his sister Kyneburge (Cyneburh), the first abbess.Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancte Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hunt (Rolls Series), vol.1 (1863), p.lxxii. H.P.R. Finberg however speculates that the Cyneburh in question was the widow of Oswald of Northumbria. Oswald was the elder brother of Oswiu and therefore the uncle of Queen Osthryth, who is said to have encouraged her aunt Cyneburh to enter a nunnery many years after Oswald's death.H.P.R.Finberg, The Early Charters of the West Midlands (Leicester 1961), p.165. Cyneburgh would therefore be the great-aunt of Osric, rather than his sister. Though the charter of Gloucester treats Osric as a subordinate of \u00c6thelred, the charter of Bath describes him as king of the Hwicce. He is also so described by Bede. He may possibly be the Osric who witnessedS 1165 a doubtful charter of Frithuwold, King of Surrey, dated 675. Osric was buried at Gloucester Abbey beside Cyneburh, before the altar of St Petronilla;Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancte Petri Gloucestriae ed. W.H. Hunt (Rolls Series), vol.1 (1863), p.6. his remains now lie in a medieval tomb in the cathedral. He seems to have been survived by his brother Oshere, and succeeded by a possible son \u00c6thelmod (mentioned in charter S 1167). ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hwiccan monarchs Category:7th-century English monarchs ",
