    "text": "Jean Aurenche (1903\u20131992) was a French screenwriter. During his career, he wrote 80 films for directors such as Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, Bertrand Tavernier, Marcel Carn\u00e9, Jean Delannoy and Claude Autant-Lara. He is often associated with the screenwriter Pierre Bost, with whom he had a fertile partnership from 1940 to 1975. == The Early Years == In the 1920s and 1930s, Jean Aurenche was friends with some members of the surrealist groups. His sister Marie-Berthe was the wife of Max Ernst and Max Ernst soon became friend with Jean Aurenche. Later, he even appeared in some film commercials directed by Jean Aurenche (for the \"Nicolas\" Wine, the \"Barbes\" stores and so on...). Jean Aurenche was also a close friend of Jean Cocteau who helped him publish several of his short stories in the famous \"NRF\". In 1933, Jean Aurenche co-directed two short documentaries with Pierre Charbonnier: Pirates du Rh\u00f4ne and Bracos de Sologne. He later co-wrote the short film Monsieur Cordon with director Pierre Pr\u00e9vert. He soon turned to screenwriting, writing or co-writing several films like L'affaire du Courrier de Lyon (1936) by Maurice Lehmann and Claude Autant- Lara, L'affaire Lafarge or, more famously, H\u00f4tel du Nord that he co-wrote with Marcel Carn\u00e9 and Henri Jeanson. == Aurench\u00e9bost == In 1942, starting with Douce (directed by Autant-Lara), Aurenche formed a longstanding partnership with Pierre Bost. Their method of writing together initially worked as such : Jean Aurenche wrote the treatment of the screenplay (sometimes based on a novel) and Pierre Bost then expanded this outline and wrote the dialogue. But soon, both of them wrote all the script together without any clear division of the writing. Together, Aurenche & Bost wrote several great successes of this time period, often associated with director Claude Autant-Lara : le Diable au corps (1945), l'Auberge rouge (1951), le Rouge et le Noir (1954), la Travers\u00e9e de Paris (1956). Meanwhile, Aurenche & Bost started a fertile collaboration with Jean Delannoy, writing for him La Symphonie Pastorale (1947) which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival of 1947. During this time, they also worked with Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment (Au-del\u00e0 des grilles, Jeux interdits and Gervaise). The film Jeux Interdits won the Academy Award on the Best Foreign Film in 1952 and soon became a classic. All these critic and commercial triumph contributed to make of Aurenche one of the most revered screenwriters of his time. == The Later Years == In 1954, future filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut wrote an article in Les Cahiers du Cinema harshly criticizing the work of Jean Aurenche & Pierre Bost. The writing team progressively went out of fashion and barely worked during the 1960s as their favorite collaborators (Autant-Lara, Cl\u00e9ment, Delannoy) grew older and retired. In 1970, young filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier (who was a fan of their work), asked them to write with him an adaptation of L'Horloger d'Everton (a Georges Simenon novel) for his first feature film. The film, titled L'Horloger de Saint Paul was a great success, both public and critical. Aurenche and Tavernier quickly became close collaborators, even after Pierre Bost's death in 1975. They went on to write three more films together and even co-directed a documentary about surrealist writer Philippe Soupaul. In 1975, Jean Aurenche and Bertrand Tavernier reworked an outline written in 1951 by Aurenche & Bost. This became the film le Juge et l'Assassin which garnered great reviews when it was released in 1976. During the 80s, Jean Aurenche kept on working with several directors like Robert Enrico (De Guerre Lasse), Bertrand Tavernier (Coup de Torchon, based on the Jim Thompson novel \"Pop. 1280\" and L'\u00c9toile du Nord de Pierre Granier-Deferre. He died in 1992 in Bandol. He was 89. == Hommages == Soon after his death, a compilation of interviews with Jean Aurenche was published. Named La Suite \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran (To be continued on the screen), this book co-wrote by French journalist Alain Riou contained insights and information about most of Jean Aurenche's screenplays and collaborators. Later, almost ten years after his death, Bertrand Tavernier co-wrote and directed a film about the life of Jean Aurenche and Jean Devaivre (a French assistant director) during World War II. The film, named Laissez Passer was starring Jacques Gamblin (as Jean Devaivre) and Denis Podalyd\u00e8s (as Jean Aurenche). In 2010, French cinema channel Cine Cinema broadcast a 52 minutes documentary about the life and work of Jean Aurenche, which is also available as a DVD. Titled Jean Aurenche, \u00e9crivain de cin\u00e9ma, this film was directed by Alexandre Hilaire and Yacine Badday. It features some of Jean Aurenche collaborators like Jean-Pierre Mocky, Alain Riou and Bertrand Tavernier. It also features Jean Aurenche himself by means of footage of a 1970 interview. == Filmography == * 1933 : Monsieur Cordon, directed by Pierre Pr\u00e9vert * 1937 : Les D\u00e9gourdis de la 11e, directed by Christian-Jaque * 1937 : Vous n'avez rien \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer ?, directed by L\u00e9o Joannon * 1937 : The Courier of Lyon, directed by Maurice Lehmann and Claude Autant-LaraClaude Autant-Lara, FilmReference.com, accessed April 2010 * 1938 : The Lafarge Case, directed by Pierre Chenal : histoire * 1938 : Le Ruisseau, directed by Maurice Lehmann : adaptation * 1938 : H\u00f4tel du Nord, directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9 : adaptation * 1939 : La Tradition de minuit * 1940 : Love Cavalcade * 1940 : The Emigrant, directed by L\u00e9o Joannon : histoire * 1940 : The Mondesir Heir, directed by Albert Valentin : histoire * 1941 : Madame Sans-G\u00eane, directed by Roger Richeb\u00e9 : adaptation * 1942 : Le Moussaillon: * 1942 : Romance \u00e0 trois, directed by Roger Richeb\u00e9 : adaptation * 1942 : Le Mariage de Chiffon, directed by Claude Autant-Lara : adaptation * 1942 : '''' * 1942 : Huit Hommes dans un ch\u00e2teau: adaptation'' * 1942 : Lettres d'amours * 1943 : L'\u00c9pouvantail : histoire'' * 1943 : Domino, directed by Roger Richeb\u00e9 * 1943 : Love Story, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1943 : Adrien, directed by Fernandel * 1944 : Le Voleur de paratonnerres: sur une id\u00e9e de * 1944 : Traveling Light, directed by Jean Anouilh * 1944 : Les Petites du quai aux fleurs, directed by Marc All\u00e9gret : sc\u00e9nario * 1946 : Sylvie et le fant\u00f4me, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1946 : Les J3 : adaptation'' * 1946 : La Symphonie pastorale, directed by Jean Delannoy * 1947 : Devil in the Flesh, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1947 : Les Amants du pont Saint-Jean, directed by Henri Decoin * 1949 : The Walls of Malapaga, directed by Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment * 1949 : Keep an Eye on Amelia, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1950 : Dieu a besoin des hommes, directed by Jean Delannoy * 1951 : Gibier de potence, directed by Roger Richeb\u00e9 : sc\u00e9nario * 1951 : The Red Inn, directed by Claude Autant-Lara: sc\u00e9nario, adaptation and dialogues * 1952 : The Seven Deadly Sins : segments La Luxure de Yves All\u00e9gret, L'Orgueil de Claude Autant- Lara et Huiti\u00e8me p\u00each\u00e9 de Georges Lacombe : sc\u00e9nario * 1952 : Forbidden Games, directed by Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment : sc\u00e9nario, dialogue * 1953 : The Proud and the Beautiful, directed by Yves All\u00e9gret * 1954 : Le Bl\u00e9 en herbe, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1954 : Daughters of Destiny (segment Jeanne), directed by Jean Delannoy * 1954 : Mam'zelle Nitouche, directed by Yves All\u00e9gret * 1954 : The Red and the Black, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1955 : ', directed by Jean Delannoy : histoire et sc\u00e9nario * 1956 : Gervaise, directed by Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment * 1956 : La Travers\u00e9e de Paris, directed by Claude Autant-Lara : dialogue et sc\u00e9nario * 1956 : The Hunchback of Notre Dame, directed by Jean Delannoy * 1958 : In Case of Adversity, directed by Claude Autant-Lara : sc\u00e9nario * 1958 : The Gambler, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1959 : The Female, directed by Julien Duvivier * 1959 : Way of Youth, directed by Michel Boisrond * 1959 : The Green Mare, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1961 : Tu ne tueras point, directed by Claude Autant-Lara * 1964 : Les amiti\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res, directed by Jean Delannoy * 1965 : A Woman in White : adaptation * 1966 : Is Paris Burning?, directed by Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment * 1967 : The Oldest Profession - one segment - directed by Claude Autant-Lara and Philippe de Broca * 1969 : Les Patates, directed by Claude Autant-Lara : scenario * 1974 : The Clockmaker, directed by Bertrand Tavernier : sc\u00e9nario * 1975 : Let Joy Reign Supreme, directed by Bertrand Tavernier : sc\u00e9nario * 1976 : The Judge and the Assassin, directed by Bertrand TavernierJean Aurenche, Cinema- Francais.fr, accessed April 2010 * 1980 : The Lady of the Camellias, directed by Mauro Bolognini : histoire * 1981 : Coup de Torchon, directed by Bertrand Tavernier : sc\u00e9nario * 1982 : L'\u00c9toile du Nord, directed by Pierre Granier- Deferre : an adaption of Georges Simenon's novel La Locataire * 1987 : Fucking Fernand, directed by G\u00e9rard Mordillat * 1987 : ', directed by Robert Enrico * 1989 : La Passion de Bernadette, directed by Jean Delannoy ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1992 deaths Category:French male screenwriters Category:20th-century French screenwriters Category:Place of birth missing ",
