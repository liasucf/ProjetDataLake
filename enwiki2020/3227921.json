It is the main town of the Tibesti Region, which was formed in 2008 from the Tibesti Department of the former Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region. ==History== The first European who reported Barda\u00ef was the German explorer Gustav Nachtigal. He reached Barda\u00ef on 8 August 1869, but had to flee on 3-4 September because of the hostile attitude of the local Toubou population. The town was invaded by the Turks in around 1908, and by 1911 they had 60 men and six cannons in Barda\u00ef. Barda\u00ef came to international attention in 1974, when a rebel group, led by Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, attacked the town and captured a French archaeologist, Fran\u00e7oise Claustre, and two other European citizens. The rebels established an anti-French radio station here during the civil war, which was known as the \"Voice of Liberation of Chad\", or Radio Barda\u00ef. An opposition government led by Goukouni Oueddei was established here with Libyan military backing in the early 1980s. In December 1986, Habr\u00e9 forces attacked the Libyans at Barda\u00ef. The Tedaga language is spoken within the Barda\u00ef area of northern Chad, although the Dazaga language is a secondary language. The town is served by Zougra Airport. The local football team is General Sal Football club. ==References== Category:Populated places in Chad Category:Tibesti Region Category:Oases of Chad Category:Tibesti Mountains ",
