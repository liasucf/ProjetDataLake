    "text": "Camael, also spelled Khamuel, Camiel, Cameel and Camniel, is the Archangel of strength, courage and war in Christian and Jewish mythology and angelology. Camael is probably an alternate spelling of either \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc (from chammah \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4: \"heat\", \"rage\"\u2014\"anger/wrath of God\")Strong's Hebrew \u2013 2536 or Qemuel \u05e7\u05b0\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc (from qum \u05e7\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd: \"to arise\", \"to stand up\"\u2014\"God is risen\", \"raised by God\", \"one who sees/stands before God\").Strong's Hebrew \u2013 7055 According to poet Gustav Davidson's popular work A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels (1967), he is known as one of the ten Kabbalah angels, assigned to the sephira Gevurah. Camael's name is also included in Pseudo-Dionysius' 5th or 6th century AD, as one of the seven Archangels along with Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Jophiel, and Zadkiel. He is claimed to be the leader of the forces that expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden holding a flaming sword. However, in iconography he is often depicted holding a cup. Camael was excluded from the Holy See's list of named angels mentioned in the Bible in the Directory of Public Piety (2002). A cult of veneration is thus excluded for Catholics.Vatican Bans Rogue Angels \"Chapter six deals with angels, delivering a stinging rebuff to followers of Uriel, Jophiel, Chamuel and Zadkiel, who enjoy a burgeoning reputation in New Age religions but make no appearance in the New or Old Testament.\" ==Gallery== File:Archangel Camael.jpg|The Principality Camael, engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, circa 1575.
