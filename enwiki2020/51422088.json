    "text": "The death of Abdirahman Abdi, a Somali-Canadian, occurred on July 24, 2016, in the neighbourhood of Hintonburg in the Kitchissippi Ward of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Abdi died in an incident with the Ottawa Police Service. ==Background== Abdi had come to Canada from Somalia in 2009. He worked at a local car wash, though he was unemployed in the months leading up to his death. At the time of his death, he was 37 years old. Following his death, Abdi's family described him as someone with mental health issues. ==Arrest and death== At approximately 9:30 a.m. on July 24, 2016, police were called to the Hintonburg Bridgehead coffee shop on the corner of Fairmont Avenue and Wellington Street West over allegations that Abdi was groping women there. (updated July 30) J.M. Duval, a witness who was present at the coffee shop since 9:15 a.m., said he saw a commotion and that the front doors were locked as a group outside restrained Abdi. Duval said it looked like Abdi was trying to either flee or get back into the shop. Duval asked the allegedly assaulted woman (who had been taken to the back of the shop) in French what had happened and she repeatedly said (translated) \"He groped me.\" Tracey Clark, the owner of Bridgehead who was not present during the incident, gave a statement on August 5 after speaking with staff and customers, describing Abdi as having harassed and assaulted multiple people in the shop. Clark mentioned this was not the first incident with him and that he would sometimes stare at customers and get too close to them. Clark said that they had previously intervened by asking Abdi if he was aware of what he was doing and if he could stop. After the Bridgehead confrontation, police pursued Abdi 250 metres (three blocks) and arrested him outside his apartment building at 55 Hilda Street. During that encounter, Abdi began to suffer \"medical distress\". Dispatchers sent an ambulance at 9:52 a.m., and a paramedic reported \"vital signs absent\" at 9:59 a.m. Abdi was later taken to the Ottawa Civic Hospital where a doctor informed the family he had died 45 minutes prior to arrival. His death was announced to the public at 3:17 p.m. on Monday, July 25. ==SIU investigation== As required under the Police Services Act, the provincial Special Investigations Unit (SIU) conducted an investigation into the incident. The SIU is required to investigate all reports of deaths, serious injuries, or sexual assaults in relation to provincial or municipal police officers. Two Ottawa Police Service officers who were involved in the arrest \u2013 Constable David Weir and Constable Daniel Montsion \u2013 were designated as subject officers during the course of the investigation. Constable Weir was later re-classified as a witness officer, while Constable Montsion would be charged with manslaughter. On March 6, 2017, the SIU laid charges against Constable Daniel Montsion for manslaughter, aggravated assault, and assault with a weapon in relation to the death of Abdi. On October 20, 2020, Montsion was found not guilty on all charges. ==Aftermath== The Abdi family retained lawyer Lawrence Greenspon two days after his death on Wednesday July 27. Abdi's funeral was held on Friday, July 29 at the Ottawa (Main) Mosque, with 800 inside and more outside. Naeem Malik, President of the Ottawa Muslim Association, estimated total attendance at over 2,000 people. The funeral was led by Imam Mohamed Hachimi and a family statement was read by Imam Sikander Hashmi of the Kanata Muslim Association. Mayor Jim Watson spoke at the funeral. The Canadian Somali Mothers' Association called for two officers to be removed and the Canadian Council of Muslim Women requested a critical look at the case. In late August, Black Lives Matter's Toronto chapter protested the SIU in Mississauga in response to Abdi's death. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:2016 deaths Category:2016 in Ontario Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths in police custody in Canada Category:History of Ottawa Category:July 2016 events in Canada ",
