He contributed to WebMuseum from 1995 before establishing the Artchive. A biography of the founder called it a \"top art resource\". A user on Pinterest called it \"such a valuable website\". However, the contact email does not currently work and the site is neglected and not updated. The Artchive website displays historic artworks with a convenient viewer that allows the size of the image to be set easily as required. It provides a leading online teaching resource for art at a university level. The Artchive contains 2,300 scans of works by more than 200 artists. Posters of displayed artworks are available. It has the same name as a service of SITO. Notable works on the site include The Fight Between Carnival and Lent by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. ==See also== * Web Gallery of Art * WebMuseum ==References== ==External links== * The Artchive Category:Virtual art museums and galleries Category:Art websites Category:Tertiary educational websites ",
