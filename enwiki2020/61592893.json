    "text": "The West Wight Potter 19 is an American trailerable sailboat that was designed by Herb Stewart as a cruiser and first built in 1971. Stewart developed the boat from the West Wight Potter 14, a British design he had bought the US rights to. The design was originally marketed by the manufacturer as the HMS 18. ==Production== The design has built by International Marine in Inglewood, California, United States since 1971 and remained in production in 2019, with more than 1600 completed. ==Design== West Wight Potter 19 West Wight Potter 19 cockpit The West Wight Potter 19 is a recreational keelboat, with a hard chine hull, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a vertically lifting fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. It is equipped with closed cell foam flotation and is unsinkable. The boat has a draft of with the lifting keel extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. The keel is retracted from the cockpit by a winch and fully retracts. The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The galley consists of a sink to port and single-burner butane stove to starboard. There is sleeping accommodation for four people and seating for five and a potable head. The manufacturer claims the boat can be rigged and launched from its trailer in 45 minutes and can also be single-handly rigged and launched. ==Operational history== A 2008 review by John Kretschmer noted, \"while plenty of Potters have made impressive passages, most are sailed quietly on lakes, bays and coastline all over the country. Most importantly, they're almost universally admired by the folks who own them, and for good reason. The boat is stable in the water, it can stand up to a breeze, it's surprisingly commodious, it's easy to launch and can be trailed behind almost any vehicle. Mounted on its trailer the West Wight Potter 19 fits snugly in most garages, which eliminates the cost of dockage and winter storage.\" Mike Brown wrote a review of the design in 2009, stating, \"it might not have the catchiest of names, but I found everything else about the West Wight Potter 19 delightful ... I am completely sold on the Potter 19, and I despair for the taste of our boating population if it does not sell in numbers. It was one of the few review boats I had to be politely ejected from. I did not want to go home.\". In a 2019 review Tom Lochhaas wrote, \"of the wide variety of small trailerable sailboats on the market, the Potter 19 better meets the needs of owners who want to do some cruising than almost others, which at this length are typically designed more for daysailing than overnighting.\" ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Com-Pac 19 *Core Sound 20 Mark 3 *Cornish Shrimper 19 *Halman 20 *Mariner 19 *Mercury 18 *Sanibel 18 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ",
