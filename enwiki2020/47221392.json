    "text": "The fourth season of American Ninja Warrior began on May 20, 2012, and aired on NBC and G4. This was a landmark season for Ninja Warrior, as the entire format was overhauled. For the first time, the finals took place on U.S. soil. In addition, regional qualifiers were added, taking place in Dallas, TX, Miami, FL, and the series' flagship location, Venice Beach, CA. New co-host Jonny Moseley replaced Jimmy Smith, while Angela Sun replaced Alison Haislip. Again, the winner would have received $500,000 and the coveted American Ninja Warrior title. Brent Steffensen became the first contestant to complete the ultimate cliffhanger. ==Qualifying== The Venice Beach regional qualifying course during season 4 Submission videos for American Ninja Warrior Season 4 had been collected since January 25, 2012. There were six regional competitions held in three locations: Venice Beach, CA (Southwest and Northwest), Dallas, TX (Midwest and Midsouth), and Miami, FL (Northeast and Southeast) that determined the 100 competitors to participate in the qualifying rounds. ===Region Finals=== The 30 competitors that went the fastest the farthest from the Qualifiers of each region, tackled an extended course, featuring three new additional obstacles, like the salmon ladder, and cargo climb. The top 15 competitors that went the fastest the farthest would move on to compete in the National Finals in Las Vegas. ====Southwest Regional Finals ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:70%;\" |- !
