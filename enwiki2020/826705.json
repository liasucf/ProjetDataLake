    "text": "Maybe I'll Catch Fire is the second album by the Chicago-based punk rock band Alkaline Trio, released on March 14, 2000 through Asian Man Records. It was their final studio album for Asian Man and their last with drummer Glenn Porter, who left the band after its release and was replaced by Mike Felumlee as the band moved to Vagrant Records. == Reception == By August 2008, the album sold 85,000 copies. Mike DaRonco of Allmusic liked the album, but less than the band's previous effort, 1998's Goddamnit, saying that \"Lyrically, Maybe I'll Catch Fire follows in the footsteps of Goddamnit, while staying true to the elaborate but emotional tone of aggressive pop-punk. Not as essential as the Trio's previous efforts, but it would be difficult for any band to follow up an album like Goddamnit\". == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Alkaline Trio *Matt Skiba \u2013 guitar, vocals *Dan Andriano \u2013 bass, vocals *Glenn Porter \u2013 drums ;Artwork *Craig Ackerman \u2013 Layout Design *Brian Case \u2013 Layout Design *Heather Han \u2013 Photography ;Production *Matt Allison \u2013 Producer, engineer *John Golden \u2013 Mastering == References == ==External links== *Maybe I'll Catch Fire at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Alkaline Trio albums Category:2000 albums Category:Asian Man Records albums Category:Albums produced by Matt Allison (record producer) ",
