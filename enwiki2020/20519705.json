    "text": "Donald William \"Dippy\" Simmons (September 13, 1931 \u2013 September 24, 2010) was a National Hockey League goaltender. He was called up by the Boston Bruins from the Springfield Indians of the AHL in order to replace an ailing Terry Sawchuk who had left the Bruins in mid-season of 1957. He then spent 3 seasons partnering with veteran Harry Lumley as an effective netminding duo in Boston. Simmons was the first goaltender to adopt the face mask after Jacques Plante introduced it in 1959. Later, Simmons would back up Johnny Bower in Toronto in the early 1960s and was instrumental in the Leafs winning the Stanley Cup in 1962. He finished his career playing with the New York Rangers. Don Simmons was the founder of Don Simmons Sports, a successful Ontario franchise specializing in goalie equipment. ==Awards and achievements== *1962 Stanley Cup Championship (Toronto) *1963 Stanley Cup Championship (Toronto) *1964 Stanley Cup Championship (Toronto) *1963 NHL All Star (Toronto) ==External links== * *Picture of Don Simmons' name on the 1962 Stanley Cup Plaque *Picture of Don Simmons' name on the 1963 Stanley Cup Plaque Category:1931 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Baltimore Clippers players Category:Boston Bruins players Category:Buffalo Bisons (AHL) players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Canadian people of British descent Category:Eastern Hockey League players Category:Galt Rockets players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Johnstown Jets (IHL) players Category:New York Rangers players Category:People from Port Colborne Category:Providence Reds players Category:Rochester Americans players Category:St. Catharines Teepees players Category:Springfield Indians players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Tulsa Oilers (1964\u20131984) players Category:Vancouver Canucks (WHL) players Category:Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States ",
