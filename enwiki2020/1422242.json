    "text": "Sorten Muld is a Danish folktronica band, formed in 1995. They have won two Danish Grammys for Mark II. The English translation of \"Sorten Muld\" is \"Black Soil\" (or \"Dark Ground\"). Their music can be characterized by elegantly composed rhythms, floating sound of typical folk-instruments like bagpipes, flutes and violins, in an electronica-composition that supports the dramatic lyrics. Some tracks on Mark II are up-beat with only few lyrics and could also be characterized as dance or techno. The lyrics are old stories from Danish folk tradition, about jealousy, murder, mythology and creatures. In \"Kirstin\" from Mark II a father serves his daughter a meal of her boyfriend's heart. In \"Ulver\" from III a man takes his girlfriend into the forest to kill and bury her. He falls asleep and she cuts him into pieces with his own sword. Sorten Muld also published a concept album called Jord, Luft, Ild, Vand (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) \u2013 a mostly instrumental journey through the classic elements. The album is a reworked recording of music commissioned by Danske Gymnastik- & Idr\u00e6tsforeninger for a gymnastics show on Bornholm. It was self-published and was only available to buy from their website. After this album the group disappeared from the public eye, but in April/May 2011 they performed three concerts in Denmark, and again in 2012 at T\u00f8nder Festival. and in 2014 and 2019. ==Members== *Ulla Bendixen \u2013 vocals *Martin Ottosen \u2013 musician-architect *Henrik Munch \u2013 electronics (all after this point appear on III only) * S\u00f8ren Bendixen \u2013 guitar * Harald Haugaard \u2013 viola, violin, hurdy-gurdy * Johannes Hejl \u2013 double bass * Niels Kilele \u2013 percussion * Tommy Nissen \u2013 drums * Martin Seeberg \u2013 bagpipe, flute, Jewish harp ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Sorten Muld (1996) *Mark II (1997) *III (2000) *Jord, Luft, Ild, Vand (2002) ===Singles=== *\"Ravnen\" (1997) *\"Ravnen\" (1997) (alternative cover/track list) *\"Bonden og Elverpigen\" (1997) *\"Som Stjernerne p\u00e5 Himlens bl\u00e5\" (1997) *\"Venelite\" (1998) *\"Mylardatter\" (1998) *\"V\u00f8lven\" (2000) ==External links== * Official site * Information from Northside * Vilden \u00d8 \u2013 unofficial site (Danish) ==References== Category:Danish musical groups Category:Danish folk music groups Category:Folktronica ",
