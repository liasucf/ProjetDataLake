It is a small campus whose students are drawn from all the other high schools in the Montebello Unified School District, which include Schurr High School, Montebello High School, Bell Gardens High School and Advanced Technology Center. The students are typically sent to Vail by their original high schools once it is determined that they are in danger of not graduating due to lack of eligible credits or poor grades. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Schools in Los Angeles County, California Category:Continuation high schools in California ",
