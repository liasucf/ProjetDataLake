    "text": "Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is a Disney Vacation Club resort at the Walt Disney World Resort. The resort is the seventh Disney Vacation Club resort and is situated on the former site of the Disney Institute. It first opened May 17, 2004 and was built in three phases. It is now the largest Disney Vacation Club resort. The resort was inspired by the city of Saratoga Springs, New York. The resort was designed by Graham Gund Architects of Cambridge, Massachusetts. There are a total of 18 Villa Buildings providing 828 Vacation Home Units (1,260 guest rooms), plus an additional 60 Treehouse Villas. Available rooms range from single room studios to three bedroom extended family suites on two floors (Grand Villas). Like other Disney Vacation Club resorts, the studios offer kitchenettes, bathrooms, one queen bed, and one sleeper sofa. While the resort has one of the lowest costs for villas on property, the Springs area is now premier status, resulting in increased prices due to the popularity. The popularity of this area is a result of the location, being one of the closest areas to the main lobby including two restaurants, the Artist's Palette and The Turf Club Bar and Grill, and the main pool, High Rock Spring pool. In October 2007, the resort received designation in the Florida Green Lodging Program.

Lake Buena Vista Golf Course is a golf course. The golf club entrance is located on the lower level of the Carriage House lobby building and is only accessible behind the Carriage House lobby building below the Turf Club Bar & Grill. The course has been a host to PGA and LPGA events. High Rock Spring Pool is the original feature pool of the resort located outside the main/clubhouse building. It is designed as a natural spring with rocks, geysers, trees, and other themed touches. It features a zero-depth entry into the pool, a waterslide that starts at the top of the spring with turns and drops into the pool below, two hot tubs outside the pool, a pop jets area for young children (with Donald Duck in a spring), and an adult bar called \"On The Rocks Pool Bar\" with pool chairs. The Paddock Pool is a second feature pool. Added in 2011, it was built due to the increased guest capacity of the Saratoga Springs Resort. Following the addition of this pool, guests who are located in the back of this large themed resort no longer must travel to the original feature pool all the way in front of resort to enjoy a feature pool. This second feature pool is the same size of the original feature pool and is themed to Paddock Village and the Springs area with a zero-depth entry into the pool, a waterslide that starts in a water tower-type structure and goes into the pool, two hot tubs, a restroom/changing room facility, and a quick service restaurant serving American, healthy, children's and Italian foods in a building themed to a Paddock building similar to the main lobby area. This building also includes a fountain drink station which accommodates to guests who purchase the souvenir mugs that get free refills. A seating area for a quick service restaurant, a pool bar adjacent to the restaurant, pool chairs and play area for young children with a spring creek theme are included. The children's play area includes smaller waterslides and a splash bucket that drops every few minutes. Additional pools are also located in The Grandstand, Congress Park, and at the Treehouse Villas. These 'quiet' pools also include whirlpools, and many include children's play areas. == Transportation == Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is served by Disney Transport bus and watercraft transportation.

There is an easement for monorail expansion, but there are currently no plans for such an expansion. As of January 2017, the springs area rooms are now premiere status, resulting in higher costs per night. The popularity of this area has increased in recent years due to the proximity to the main area including Artists pallet, high springs pool, and the dining restaurant. == Disney Vacation Club Preview Center == The Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa contains the Disney Vacation Club Preview Center, the official open house and sales center for the Disney Vacation Club. The center includes a preview lobby and several full- scale model villas of the latest Disney Vacation Club resorts. == Walt Disney World Conference Center == The Walt Disney World Conference Center was a chalet-style building that was designed for small and medium-sized business meetings. It opened in August 1980 along the banks of Club Lake and was then converted into part of the Disney Institute. It was later demolished when construction began on the Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa, which now stands on the grounds of the former Institute. The conference center had four rooms which could be broken down into several configurations. The largest breakout room, at , could seat 505 guests with theater-style seating. Each meeting room faced the lake and had automatic lighting that would turn on when external light conditions required them. Meeting planners could have themed entertainment with the Disney characters as well as the ability to arrange for a round of golf or a tennis match. The conference center could not handle large conventions and the large groups were forced to use newly created meeting spaces at the Walt Disney World Dolphin, Walt Disney World Swan, Disney's Contemporary Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa hotels, which resulted in the closure of the conference center. == References == == External links == * Category:Disney Vacation Club Category:Hotels established in 2004 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Florida ",
