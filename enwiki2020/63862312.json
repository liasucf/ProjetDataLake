The Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District (MPRPD) manages the Garland Ranch Regional Park. ==History== The Rumsen Indian tribe lived in the lower Carmel River Valley and neighboring Monterey Peninsula at the time of Spanish colonization. In 1923, Marion Hollins bought 2,000 acres from the Del Monte Properties that held property in Carmel Valley. In 1926, developer Frank Porter acquired a portion of the Hollins ranch and sold it to Byington Ford. Byington used 400-acres as a summer ranch and named it Moon Trail Ranch. The ranch was later sold to William May Garland II around 1970, who also bought other ranches in the area. The ranch was located off Carmel Valley Road and extended across the Carmel River up to the hayfield called \"La Mesa\". This area is now just off Via Las Encinas road, which is now one of the trailheads, on the Garland Ranch Regional Park, called the Via Las Encinas trailhead. On June 19, 1976, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District opened the 541-acre Garland Ranch Regional Park, 18 miles from Salinas at the south side of Carmel Valley Road on a one-half mile of the Carmel River. The park district acquired the Garland ranch in March 1975 from the late William May Garland II for $1.1 million, along with a $250,00 gift from Garland. After Garland died on May 10, 1975, the park district named the park after him. ==Habitat and conservation== Garland Ranch Regional Park; Mesa Trail Several ecosystems exist in the park and preserve.
