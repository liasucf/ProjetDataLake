    "text": "Buxus citrifolia is a species of plant in the family Buxaceae. It is found in Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela. This interesting shrub has not been known to occur in Central America, having only been collected and/or reported in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. Buxus citrifolia is nearly extinct and has been on the endangered list. The hermaphrodite shrub, having both the male and female reproductive organs in the same individual, is 3\u20135 m tall with a 5 cm diameter at breast height. Twigs are free from hair and somewhat tetragonal, while the angle ridges are prominent. The leaves are elliptic to narrowly elliptic-ovate while being wedge-shaped or round at the base. The leaves are 5\u201312 cm long, 2\u20135 cm wide having the sub-3-veined from the base with the outer 2 nerves forming submarginal veins. The petiole margined and 2\u20135 mm long. The complete flower head of a plant including stems, stalks, bracts, and flowers, inflorescence, is short only about 1\u20132 cm long axillary. Cymose, definite inflorescence, with a single terminal female flower and several lateral male flowers. The bract, modified leaf, is triangular and 1\u20132 mm long. Pedicels of male flowers 2\u20134 mm long, the female flowers sessile. Flowers are white and fragrant. Buxus citrifolia has been considered similar to another species in the family Buxaceae \u2013 Buxus laevigata. B. citrifolia differs in the fact that B. laevigata \u2013 native to Jamaica \u2013 has smaller fruits and flowers. When comparing them to B. citrifolia, the elliptic leaves are broader and has more pronounced secondary venation and more marginal lateral veins. The Martinique plant has also often been confused with B. citrifolia, however, the Martinique plant has been found to have long capsule horns and bigger flowers than B. citrifolia. ==References== citrifolia Category:Near threatened plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
