Aimed at the family and teenagers, it was initially broadcasting on Saturday afternoons. As of 19 April 1998, the TV show was aired on Sundays due to the transmissions of the 1998 World Cup, remaining on Sundays until its 2002. It was the first Sunday evening program of auditorium hosted by a woman on Brazilian television, because before Xuxa, the dispute was only between men, like Silvio Santos, Faust\u00e3o and Gugu Liberato. Presenters M\u00e1rcia Goldschmidt and Eliana followed the footsteps of Xuxa and also appeared on Sunday afternoons on Brazilian TV. The program was an audience success with averages always above 21 points, often surpassing Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o. Planeta Xuxa was being fully re-released by Canal Viva, on Sundays at 7:00 p.m., and its re-run on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. The program was re-released on September 7, 2014, leaving the channel among the 10 most watched on time, recording one of the best pay-TV audiences. After Xuxa signs a contract with Rede Record, Canal Viva ceased to show the program. ==Concept== Planeta Xuxa was focused on the musical performances from contemporary artists and bands. The program had the format of a discotech, had the participation of the public and welcomed famous guests. To animate the auditorium and keep the party mood in the studios, Xuxa counted on Paquitas New Generation, with the group of dancers You Can Dance, with the twins Mariana and Roberta Richard and with the dancer Adriana Bombom. One of the most prominent paintings was Intimidade, in which Xuxa interviewed guests by asking intimate questions. In the premiere program, the interviewee was the actor Marcello Antony. Personalities such as actresses Let\u00edcia Sabatella and Arlete Salles, soccer players Ronaldo and Renato Ga\u00facho, singer Mark Knopfler, British band Dire Straits, Judge Siro Darlan, and others. Madonna is also on the list of celebrities who spoke to the show in an interview in 1998. When it was a year in the air, in April 1998, the Planeta Xuxa won a beauty salon, where the Transforma\u00e7\u00e3o was happening, a great success. Xuxa selected people from the audience willing to give a reinvigorated look, from haircut to clothes. Weekly, when the time of attraction came, the participants would raise their hands, euphoric, and wave to the hostess, asking them to be the chosen ones. In June of the same year, another picture was implanted in the program: Viagem Surpresa do Planeta, in which the camera focused some participant in the audience that gained a trip of a week for some Brazilian tourist spot. The lucky guy should have immediate availability to board. ==History== On April 19, 1998, the program changed day and time, and it will be shown on Sundays at noon. Still with the general direction of Marlene Mattos, was subordinated to the general direction of creation of Carlos Manga. In July 1998, when the presentress entered maternity leave, several famous singers took turns in the command of the program: Ivete Sangalo; Alexandre Pires; Gabriel, o Pensador; Daniel; Zez\u00e9 di Camargo & Luciano among others. In August 1999, the Paquitas of the Generation 2000 also happened to be part of the attraction. The team was formed by Monique Alfradique, Daiane Amendola, Lana Rodes, Thalita Ribeiro, Gabriella Ferreira, Leticia Barros, Joana Mineiro and Stephanie Gulin. In April of the year 2000, the Planet Xuxa underwent new modifications. The Paquitas went to Xuxa Park (1994), infantile also presented by Xuxa. The presenter started to count on 15 new helpers, called Garotas do Zodiaco. The group consisted of Marcella Siede (Aries), Fabiana Telles (Aries), Marina Azze (Taurus), Daniele Nabor (Gemini), Ana Cec\u00edlia Calderon (Gemini), Sabrina Miragaia (Cancer), Bianca Barbosa ), Danah (Virgo), Gisella Prattes (Libra), Fernanda Fontoura (Scorpio), Francine Melo (Sagittarius), Nadja Haddad (Capricorn), Patr\u00edcia Marques (Capricorn), L\u00edvia Pais (Aquarius), Fernanda Freitas (Aquarius). Planeta Xuxa also had one more member on his team: journalist Alex Lerner, who had been doing interviews with international music stars. The program also featured new cadres this year, such as Running Behind Damage, which sought to secure extra cash for people with financial difficulties through tasks set by the program. Also in April 2000, Marlene Mattos assumed the direction of a Nucleus of Production, and happened to command entirely Planet Xuxa. At that time, the program had general direction of Marlene Mattos, writing of Vivian Perl, direction of production of Aluizio Augusto and management of production of Jayme Square. In 2001, Xuxa won other stage assistants: the \"Mano\" and the \"Mina\", a group of four boys and three girls with the task of further animating the audience. In that year, new paintings were inaugurated. In Giro do Planeta, Dudu Miranda, Alex Lerner and Andr\u00e9a Veiga carried out national and international reports on various subjects; The Redaction of the Planeta was directed by the promoters David Brazil and Amin Khader, and talked about the world of celebrities; in Address of the Heart, the presenter visited the house of famous friends - in the first edition, Xuxa went to Goi\u00e1s to visit the sertanejo singer Leonardo; and in A Man on the Wheel, a guest answered three types of questions - professional, intimate and indiscreet - by the actresses M\u00f4nica Carvalho, Paula Burlamaqui and Juliana Paes. At the beginning of 2002, Planeta Xuxa presented Jogos de Ver\u00e3o, a series of competitions that counted on the participation of special guests. The tests, which included running, climbing, jumping and crawling, among other modalities, were recorded at Marechal Hermes, Campo dos Afonsos, in the western area of Rio de Janeiro. New frames have also been created. Next to the old and successful Intimacy, which received the actress Solange Couto in her re-screening in the new phase, were Entre Amigos and Espertos do Planeta. Planeta Xuxa also hosted two new members, the Scorpio (Rafael) and Ariano (Marcelo). In June 2002, the partnership between Xuxa and Marlene Mattos, her manager and director, ended. While the presenter wanted to work with children, the director preferred the adolescent audience. The two have worked together for 18 years, since Xuxa's debut on the now-defunct TV Manchete in 1984. Marlene is the godmother of Sasha, the hostess's daughter. On July 28, 2002, the last Planeta Xuxa was shown. The presenter started to dedicate herself to the children's project in the Xuxa no Mundo da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o, which debuted on TV Globo in October 2002. == Awards == Pr\u00eamio Extra de TV (1999) * Variety Show (won) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Rede Globo original programming Category:Brazilian television talk shows Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:1998 Brazilian television series debuts Category:2002 Brazilian television series endings Category:1990s Brazilian television series Category:2000s Brazilian television series Category:Brazilian music television series Category:Brazilian television series Category:Xuxa ",
