Born in Zimbru, Arad County, her parents were Constantin T\u0103la\u0219, a notary, deputy prefect and supporter of the 1848 revolutionaries in the \u021aara Zarandului area; and his wife Amalia. Her childhood was spent at Aciua, H\u0103lmagiu and Baia de Cri\u0219; a graduate of the Romanian girls' school in H\u0103lmagiu, she also took private lessons. Nevertheless, Hodo\u0219, a precocious and voracious reader of literature, was largely self-taught. She married writer Alexandru I. Hodo\u0219, but the union proved a failure, prompting her to move to Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom, in 1886. There, she undertook sustained publishing activity, penning articles on patriotic, social and cultural themes. She edited Revista noastr\u0103 from 1905 to 1916, and also contributed to Adev\u0103rul literar \u0219i artistic, Dacia Traian\u0103, Luceaf\u0103rul, Lumea ilustrat\u0103, Minerva, Revista scriitoarei, S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul, Sibiul literar, Telegraful rom\u00e2n, Transilvania, Universul, Viea\u021ba and Via\u021ba literar\u0103. Her writing debut came in Familia in 1891, under the pseudonym Th. Costan. Using the same name, she published her first volume, the novella Aur!, in 1893. Subsequently, she wrote the short prose volumes Spre fericire (1897), Frumos (1905), Departe de lume (1909) and Aci, pe p\u0103m\u00e2nt (1914), as well as the novel Martirii (1908). Her plays included Aur! (1903), M\u00e2ntuirea (1920) and Judec\u0103torul (1922); these were staged at the National Theatre Bucharest, as well as by amateur troupes in her native Transylvania. Hodo\u0219 also wrote plays and stories for children: Teatru de copii (1914), Rodica. \u00cen v\u00e2rtejul r\u0103zboiului (1921) and Povestiri din via\u021ba copiilor (1928). She was a member of the governing committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, and in 1910 was awarded the Bene Merenti medal, first class.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol.
