    "text": "Lorenzo Alcantuz (1741-1782) was a Colombian revolutionary. He was born in Sogamoso. Alongside Jose Antonio Galan, he was a key leader of the Revoluci\u00f3n Comunera of 1781. This is considered to be the most important revolutionary movement in New Granada/Colombia prior to the achievement of national independence in the early 19th century. The insurrection was triggered by violent riots in Simacota, Mogotes, Barichara and Curit\u00ed in December 1780. The town of San Gil quickly joined the protests and it was there that Alcantuz carried out the symbolic revolutionary act of trampling on the royal coat of arms, which represented Spanish colonial power. The authorities took a dim view of the insurgency, and the main instigators Alcantuz, Gal\u00e1n, Isidro Molina and Juan Manuel Jos\u00e9 Ortiz were all hanged in Bogota on 1 February 1782. They were then decapitated and their dead bodies quartered and burned. Alcantuz's head was displayed in San Gil.Bio An indoor stadium in San Gil is now named after him. ==References== category:Colombian revolutionaries Category:1741 births Category:1782 deaths ",
