It has been given the nickname R2-D2 by the people of Nashville after the character in the Star Wars movies. The top of the building currently features the signage of Regions Financial Corporation. The new logo was put into place on May 12, 2013. Several other now-retired banks have seen their logos at the top, including Dominion Bank (acquired by First Union), First Union (which sold its presence in Nashville to Firstar), and Firstar (which acquired, and later became, US Bank). Regions has made a move to One Nashville Place and now has their logo on top of One Nashville Place. Boston investors, TA Associates Realty, bought the building in late 2014 for $98.8 million and put the Boyle Investment Company in charge of leasing and managing the office tower. In September 2018, it was purchased by Unico Properties, a Seattle-based property investment company, for $139.5 million. ==Major Tenants== *Regions Financial Corporation *Professional Credential Services *Lassiter, Tidwell, Davis, Keller & Hogan, PLLC *NASBA *Merrill Lynch *Neal & Harwell *CB Richard Ellis *Ernst & Young *Manier & Herod *Agency for the Performing Arts * BNY Mellon [May 2018] *WeWork *AllianceBernstein ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Nashville ==References== ==External links== *One Nashville Place website Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Nashville, Tennessee Category:U.S. Bank buildings Category:Regions Financial Corporation Category:Office buildings completed in 1985 ",
