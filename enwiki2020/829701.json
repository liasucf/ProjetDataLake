    "text": "Operation Lifesaver is a 501(c)(3) educational organization in the United States dedicated to promoting safety at railroad grade crossings and railroad rights-of-way. Operation Lifesaver is the largest rail safety organization in the United States. It was founded by the Union Pacific Railroad in the early 1970s. ==History== In 1972, the Idaho State Highway Patrol, then-Governor Cecil Andrus and the Union Pacific Railroad mounted campaign to promote \"Stop, Look and Listen\" safety at highway-rail grade crossings. The initial teams spoke to civic groups, school groups, school bus and truck drivers. Idaho experienced a 43% reduction in fatalities that first year. Operation Lifesaver has authorized volunteer speakers and trained instructors who provide free rail safety education programs across the U.S. and abroad. They give free presentations to school groups, driver education classes, community members, professional drivers, law enforcement officers, and emergency responders. Their programs are co-sponsored by federal, state and local government agencies, highway safety organizations and America's railroad systems. Operation Lifesaver, Inc. Who We Are. 7 February 2020. 7 February 2020. . ==Campaigns== In 2006, Operation Lifesaver requested that Disney edit a scene of the Pixar film Cars in which the character of Lightning McQueen races a train to a grade crossing while the crossing lights are flashing. Disney/Pixar has removed the scene in question from theater showings but the DVD release of the movie still includes the scene. On October 14th, 2016, Operation Lifesaver requested via a Facebook post that Hollister Co. remove advertisements from their website showing teenagers walking on railroad tracks. Hollister removed the advertisements five days later, on October 19th, 2016. In September 2017, Operation Lifesaver, Inc. spearheaded the observance of Rail Safety Week across the U.S. to raise awareness of the need for caution near railroad tracks and property. In 2018, Operation Lifesaver Canada, which had been holding rail safety week observances for years, aligned its Rail Safety Week dates to coincide with the U.S. observance. ==Criticism== Operation Lifesaver has been criticized for its strong ties to the railroad industry and the group's skew toward the railroad industry. The industry has reduced its support of the group\u2019s efforts by providing fewer workers to help spread the group\u2019s safety message. The group has also been criticized for not doing enough to support pedestrian railroad safety in the United States. ==Images== image:WAMX Loco No.4020.jpg|WAMX #4020 with an Operation Lifesaver Kansas sticker. image:NS Loco No.5262.jpg|NS #5262 (ex-Conrail) with Operation Lifesaver paint scheme. image:BN 12580.JPG|BNSF Manitoba Caboose (BN 12580) with Operation Lifesaver Canada paint scheme. ==References== == External links == * * Operation Lifesaver Canada - Official website Category:Transportation organizations based in the United States Category:Level crossings Category:Public service announcements of the United States Category:Railway safety Category:Union Pacific Railroad Category:1970s establishments in the United States simple:Non-profit ",
