Baldivis is a semi-rural residential suburb south of Perth, Western Australia|Perth , and southeast of the regional centre of Rockingham. It is located within the City of Rockingham local government area. Housing estates in the suburb include Tuart Ridge, Settlers Hills, Settlers Townside, The Rivergums, Baldivis Central, Baldivis North, Baldivis Gardens, The Chimes, Brightwood, Evermore Heights, The Ridge, The Chase, Highbury Park, Heritage Park, The Dales, Avalon, Woodleigh Grove, Sherwood and Parkland Heights. ==History== The name of Baldivis was thought up by settlers in the area who were attracted to the region by the 1920s Group Settlement Scheme. The name derives from three ships which travelled to Western Australia in 1922, all within six weeks of each other, bringing settlers under the scheme. They were named BALranald, DIogenes and the JerVIS Bay. It was the maiden voyage for all three ships and they were all built in the same shipyard in the same year. Land parallel to the eastern side of Baldivis Road was set aside for a tramway between Jandakot in the north and Karnup to the south, to provide access to the Group Settlement Scheme land. Although part of the tramway was constructed, it was never constructed in Baldivis. The tramway reserve is retained for open space. Many of the road names in Baldivis (e.g. Sixty Eight Road, Fifty Road, etc.) originate from the group numbers. Land in the western portion of Baldivis was zoned for urban development in the 1990s, and the suburb has been progressively developed for residential. The first residential estate to be developed was Settlers Hills, by Stockland. ==Geography== The western half of Baldivis (generally west of Baldivis Road) is composed of undulating sand and limestone soil with occasional wetlands. The high point is known as Tamworth Hill, which is the site of a water reservoir. Much of this land has been developed for residential use. East of Baldivis Road the land is generally flat and comprises sand and clay soils; the exception being the sandy hill known as Dog Hill. These areas are generally used for rural purposes. The western portion of Baldivis contains tuart trees; some of the trees have been retained within the residential areas. ==Transport== Baldivis is serviced by the Transperth 563 bus route, operated by Transdev WA, which operates from Warnbro Train Station.

Both routes run 7 days a week running every 30 minutes and every 10 minutes in peak hours. Route 568 services Baldivis Central and the newly developed Town Side estate and Retirement village.
