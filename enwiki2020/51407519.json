The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 68% of approval with an average rating of 6.35/10, based on 74 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Too tasteless for mainstream viewers and too silly for horror enthusiasts, Scream Queens fails to satisfy.\" On Metacritic, the season was given a score of 59 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". IGN reviewer Terri Schwartz gave a very positive review of the two-hour premiere, giving it a 9.7 out of 10 and saying \"Ryan Murphy has worked his TV magic again with a killer start to Scream Queens. From the acting to the costuming to the writing, everything about this concept and execution works. Scream Queens is as funny and self-aware as it needs to be to not bore audiences, but also offers up enough mystery and intrigue to keep even the biggest skeptic entertained.\" The Telegraph also gave a positive review, awarding the show four stars out of five. They commented that the show pummels \"the viewer into submission with sheer, rictus-grinning relentlessness\" and praised it for being \"shiny, gory and whip-smart.\" Robert Rorke of The New York Post panned the series, later putting it on his list of 10 worst TV shows of 2015 and criticized Roberts' performance, saying that she \"can't act\". ===Ratings=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | No. ! scope=\"col\" | Episode ! scope=\"col\" | Air date ! scope=\"col\" | Rating/share (18\u201349) ! scope=\"col\" | Viewers (millions) ! scope=\"col\" | DVR (18\u201349) ! scope=\"col\" | DVR viewers (millions) ! scope=\"col\" | Total (18\u201349) ! scope=\"col\" | Total viewers (millions) |- | scope=\"row\" | 1 | \"Pilot\" | rowspan=2| | rowspan=2| 1.7/5 | rowspan=2| 4.04 | rowspan=2| 1.4 | rowspan=2| 3.02 | rowspan=2| 3.1 | rowspan=2| 7.06 |- | scope=\"row\" | 2 | \"Hell Week\" |- | scope=\"row\" | 3 | \"Chainsaw\" | | 1.4/5 | 3.46 | 1.3 | 2.51 | 2.7 | 5.98 |- | scope=\"row\" | 4 | \"Haunted House\" | | 1.2/4 | 2.97 | 0.9 | 1.93 | 2.1 | 4.89 |- | scope=\"row\" | 5 | \"Pumpkin Patch\" | | 1.0/3 | 2.39 | 0.8 | 1.77 | 1.8 | 4.16 |- | scope=\"row\" | 6 | \"Seven Minutes in Hell\" | | 1.0/3 | 2.59 | 0.7 | 1.57 | 1.7 | 4.16 |- | scope=\"row\" | 7 | \"Beware of Young Girls\" | | 1.0/3 | 2.44 | 0.8 | 1.67 | 1.8 | 4.11 |- | scope=\"row\" | 8 | \"Mommie Dearest\" | | 0.9/3 | 2.51 | 0.8 | 1.67 | 1.7 | 4.18 |- | scope=\"row\" | 9 | \"Ghost Stories\" | | 0.9/3 | 2.37 | 0.8 | 1.69 | 1.7 | 4.06 |- | scope=\"row\" | 10 | \"Thanksgiving\" | | 0.8/3 | 1.98 | 1.0 | 1.97 | 1.8 | 3.95 |- | scope=\"row\" | 11 | \"Black Friday\" | | 0.9/3 | 2.40 | 0.8 | 1.57 | 1.7 | 3.96 |- | scope=\"row\" | 12 | \"Dorkus\" | rowspan=2| | rowspan=2| 0.9/3 | rowspan=2| 2.53 | rowspan=2| 0.7 | rowspan=2| 1.39 | rowspan=2| 1.6 | rowspan=2| 3.92 |- | scope=\"row\" | 13 | \"The Final Girl(s)\" |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2015 American television seasons Season 1 ",
