If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings: #Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question; #Superior goal difference resulting from the group matches played among the teams in question; #Superior goal difference in all group matches; #Superior ratio of goals in all group matches, resulting from the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded; #Higher number of goals scored in all group matches; #If only two teams had the same number of points, and they were tied according to criteria 1 to 5 after having met in the last round of the group stage, their rankings were determined by a direct free kick shoot-out (not used if more than two teams had the same number of points, or if their rankings were not relevant for qualification for the next stage).
