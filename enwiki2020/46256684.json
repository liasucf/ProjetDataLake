Soon it was stocked by department stores, including Macy's and Bloomingdale's. In the early 1980s, the brand expanded to selling women's and children's apparel. During this time, it became available worldwide. In the 1990s, Cherokee established a partnership with Target. It is listed on the NASDAQ.

From 2002, Cherokee was sold at Tesco in the United Kingdom until 2015, when Argos took over the rights to sell the brand. However, following the 2016 acquisition of Argos by the UK retailer Sainsbury's, the Cherokee brand was quietly dropped and replaced by Sainsbury's own Tu brand of clothing in 2017. In December 2002, the company further expanded by acquiring the Carole Little, Saint Tropez, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks. From 2011 to 2015 Cherokee was sold at Target Canada stores and now acquired by Sears Canada. Prior to Target, the label was sold by Zellers in Canada since 1998.
