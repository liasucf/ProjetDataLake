    "text": "Philip Michael Rivers (born December 8, 1981) is an American football quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at North Carolina State and was selected in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft as the fourth overall pick by the New York Giants, who traded him to the San Diego Chargers during the draft. Rivers was a member of the Chargers franchise for 16 seasons before signing with the Colts in 2020. After spending his first two seasons in a backup role, Rivers served as the Chargers' starting quarterback from 2006 to 2019. During his tenure with the Chargers, he was named to eight Pro Bowls while leading the team to four division titles and six postseason appearances. He also helped the team win their first playoff game since 1994 during the 2007 season, which culminated in a trip to the AFC Championship Game. His career in the postseason has been less successful, however, compiling a 5\u20136 record and never reaching the Super Bowl. Statistically, Rivers ranks sixth all-time in both passing yards and touchdowns and holds a career passer rating of 95.1, which is tenth-best all-time among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts. He is also second all-time in consecutive regular season starts by a quarterback in NFL history, having started every regular season game since 2006, and is the active leader in consecutive quarterback starts. ==Early life== Rivers was born in Decatur, Alabama, where his father, Steve, was the head coach of Decatur High's football team and his mother, Joan, was a teacher. Rivers went to Decatur then moved to Athens. As part of a fifth-grade project, he had to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations. On the poster, he pasted his face over that of a Minnesota Vikings player who had appeared on a cover of Sports Illustrated. Rivers' first start in an official game came in the seventh grade, in 1994. He has worn the number 17 jersey since the ninth grade, in honor of his father, who wore the same number in high school. After his dad got the head coaching job, Rivers played high school football at Athens High School in nearby Athens. As Rivers's senior season unfolded, he established himself as the best prep passer in the state. Although he had offers from Auburn and Alabama, neither projected him as a starting quarterback. Rivers rejected them in order to go to a program where he would have more playing time. The first college to seriously recruit Rivers as a quarterback was North Carolina State. Joe Pate convinced Rivers and his parents to consider graduating from high school in December 1999. ==College career== After high school, Rivers attended North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he played for coach Chuck Amato's Wolfpack football team. Rivers enrolled in January and suited up for his first practice as a college quarterback in the spring of 2000. As a freshman in 2000, Rivers led NC State to an 8\u20134 record, including a win against Minnesota in the MicronPC Bowl. Four of the Wolfpack's victories were comebacks. In his debut, a 38\u201331 double-overtime win over Arkansas State, he passed for 397 yards and three touchdowns. He directed a 74-yard game-tying drive as time expired. A week later, he threw for 401 yards in a 41\u201338 win against Indiana. The performance was highlighted by a timely 47-yard pass to future first round pick Koren Robinson with under a minute to go. Against Duke, NC State trailed 31\u201328 late in the fourth quarter when Rivers scored a rushing touchdown on a seven-yard run. Rivers threw for a season-high 413 yards to go along with three touchdowns and one interception For the season, Rivers passed for 3,054 yards and 25 touchdowns. He broke a half-dozen school passing marks, was ACC Rookie of the Week a record eight times, and earned honors as the conference Freshman of the Year. For the first time since Roman Gabriel ran the Wolfpack offense in the early 1960s, NC State had an All-American caliber quarterback. As a sophomore in 2001, Rivers connected for 2,586 yards and 16 touchdowns. His 65.2 percent completion mark led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The Wolfpack finished the 2001 campaign at 7\u20134 and made a return trip to the Tangerine Bowl. The quarterback had a great game against Pitt in a 34\u201319 loss, passing for 189 yards and a touchdown. In 2002, Rivers led the Wolfpack to victories in their first nine games. It was the best start in the school's history. The season took a disappointing turn however when they lost three consecutive ACC contests, but NC State defeated Florida State by a score of 17\u20137 in their season finale, and received an invitation to play against Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Once again, Rivers delivered an MVP performance in the most important game of the year, pacing the Wolfpack to a dominating 28\u20136 win over Notre Dame. In the victory, Rivers was 23-of-37 for 228 passing yards and two passing touchdowns. The game would set up a remarkable year for Rivers in 2003. As a senior in 2003, Rivers threw for 4,491 yards and 34 touchdowns in 12 games, capping his career as the most productive and durable quarterback in ACC history. The season started with a 59\u201320 victory over Western Carolina where Rivers had 320 passing yards and three passing touchdowns. The Wolfpack suffered their first loss of the season in the next game at Wake Forest despite Rivers throwing for 433 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions. In the following game, a loss at Ohio State, he had 315 passing yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. After a win over Texas Tech the following game, he passed for 423 yards and a touchdown in a victory against North Carolina. In the second half of the season, Rivers strung together three consecutive games with great passing performances. He had 369 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in a victory over Duke. The next game, he had 410 passing yards and four touchdowns in a victory over Virginia. Lastly, he had 422 passing yards and four touchdowns in a loss to Florida State. Rivers' time at NC State had a great ending, leading the Wolfpack to a 56\u201326 win over Kansas in his third Tangerine Bowl. In the victory, he threw for a career-high 475 yards and five touchdowns. Philip earned his fourth straight bowl MVP award. At the end of the season, Rivers was named ACC Player of the Year for the 2003 football season and ACC Athlete of the Year for 2003\u201304. He was considered a Heisman candidate during the season, but he was not invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation. During his collegiate career, Rivers shattered almost every NC State and ACC passing record. He started 51 straight games and completed a conference record 1,147 passes in 1,710 tries, with 95 touchdowns. His career culminated with an NCAA record 51st consecutive college start. The Wolfpack went to four consecutive bowl games under the leadership of Rivers, winning three of them. Rivers finished his career at NC State with 13,484 passing yards, 13th all-time among Division I quarterbacks (he finished in second place at the end of his collegiate career). He also threw 95 touchdown passes, which tied him for eighth all-time with Kliff Kingsbury and Brady Quinn. Rivers' number was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State. ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year !! rowspan=\"2\"| Team !! colspan=\"8\"| Passing !! colspan=\"4\"| Rushing |- ! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! |- ! 2000 !!

However, despite Rivers's record of success in college and remarkable accuracy (72% completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some NFL GMs. The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 11th pick. The San Diego Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft. However, after Eli Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with them, Rivers was their first alternative because the Chargers head coach at the time, Marty Schottenheimer, had coached him at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw. The Chargers agreed to a draft day deal with the New York Giants. San Diego selected Manning first, then traded him to New York for Rivers, taken by the Giants fourth, plus draft picks later used by the Chargers on future Pro Bowlers Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding. Rivers was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Manning and the Pittsburgh Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger. All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the 1983 NFL Draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Dan Marino. Of the three, Rivers has been the highest in pass completions, completion percentage, TD\u2013INT ratio, passing yards, passer rating, and Pro Bowl honors. However, while Manning and Roethlisberger each have two championship titles, Rivers has not reached the Super Bowl during his career. ===San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers=== ====2004 season==== In August 2004, Rivers signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract with the San Diego Chargers that included $14.5 million in signing bonuses. However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego Chargers, Rivers only reported to the team during the last week of training camp, and incumbent Drew Brees retained his starting job. Rivers began the season as the Chargers' third quarterback option, behind Doug Flutie, and ahead of the fourth quarterback on the depth chart, Cleo Lemon. Unfortunately for Rivers, Brees went on to have a then- career year and was named to the NFL Pro Bowl while winning the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. Rivers received very limited playing time, playing in only two games. He only threw passes in the second half of the last game of the 2004 season, a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, by which time the Chargers had already clinched a home playoff spot and the AFC West division title. In the victory, he threw his first touchdown pass to fellow rookie Malcom Floyd. He was not on the active roster for San Diego's Divisional Round playoff loss to the New York Jets. ====2005 season==== Rivers handing off to LaDainian Tomlinson in Baltimore in 2006 Rivers was promoted to second on the Chargers quarterback depth chart after Flutie was released. Rivers was unable to beat out Brees for the starting quarterback job in the Chargers' 2005 training camp and preseason. In the Chargers' final game of the 2005 season, at home in Qualcomm Stadium, Rivers entered the game after Brees dislocated his right shoulder late in the second quarter due to a hit from Denver Broncos safety John Lynch. Rivers completed 12 of 22 passing attempts for 115 yards with one interception and two fumbles. The Chargers lost to Denver, 23\u20137. However, Rivers led the Chargers on their only scoring drive that game, which culminated in a four-yard touchdown run by running back LaDainian Tomlinson. ====2006 season==== Rivers in Baltimore in 2006 After the 2005 season, Brees was not re-signed (partly due to the injury suffered in the Denver game) by the Chargers. Instead he signed a large contract that included sizeable guaranteed money with the New Orleans Saints, during the 2006 free agency period. Many doubted the Chargers' decision to change quarterbacks as they were a Super Bowl contender, believing that Rivers' inexperience would hinder them. Rivers was named the Chargers' starter going into training camp. Expectations were high for Rivers due to the large amount of talent on the San Diego Chargers' offense and the performance of his peers from the 2004 draft (Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger) as starters. Football Outsiders projected that Rivers would become an NFL star before the 2006 season due to his spectacular completion percentage in college (72% as a senior). After just five NFL starts, Rivers was named the second best NFL quarterback under 25 years of age by Sports Illustrated. On September 11, 2006, Rivers made his first NFL start against the Oakland Raiders. Rivers managed the game well despite only passing 11 times, but completed 8 passes, one for a touchdown, in a 27\u20130 rout of the Raiders. After his first game, Rivers led the league in QB rating with 133.9. The fifth week of the season, the reigning Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers came to town, and Bill Cowher's defensive game plan revolved around stopping running back LaDainian Tomlinson. This game marked a turning point for Rivers, who, aided by head coach Marty Schottenheimer's opening of the playbook, led the team in a come-from-behind victory, throwing 24-of-37 for 242 yards and two touchdowns, winning 23\u201313. On November 12, 2006, Rivers had the best game of his short career and led the Chargers to an improbable comeback on the road against the Cincinnati Bengals. Down 28\u20137 at halftime, Rivers led the Chargers on six drives culminating in touchdowns. After driving in for the Chargers first touchdown after halftime, Nick Hardwick, the Chargers' center, reminisced about Rivers, mimicking his southern drawl, \"He's yelling 'Y'all don't think we're out of this' to the Bengals. When he said that, I said, 'Shoot, I guess we ain't out of this. Right on.'\" He threw for 337 yards and three touchdown passes, while LaDainian Tomlinson scored three of their four rushing touchdowns. San Diego outscored Cincinnati 42\u201313 in the second half, winning the game 49\u201341, matching the biggest comeback in 23 years for the Chargers. The following week against what was considered at the time to be a strong Denver Broncos defense, the Chargers became the first team in NFL history to win back-to-back road games after trailing by 17 or more points and also the first team to win four straight when allowing at least 27 points in each game. Rivers led several 4th quarter comebacks in 2006, and posted the league's highest 4th quarter quarterback rating. His performance over the season led to his selection to the 2007 Pro Bowl. After a 14\u20132 season the Chargers had home field advantage and were set to play the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. However, the Patriots won that game 24\u201321, and Schottenheimer was fired amid conflicts with team president Dean Spanos. ====2007 season==== Norv Turner took over as head coach of the Chargers in 2007. Rivers started the 2007 season with 190 passing yards and an interception in a 14\u20139 victory over the Chicago Bears. After a 1\u20133 start, the Chargers turned their season around, finishing 11\u20135 and winning the AFC West for the second straight year. On October 7, against the Denver Broncos, he recorded a career-high 151.4 passer rating from going 13 of 18 for 270 yards and two touchdowns in the 41\u20133 victory. The Chargers also won their first two playoff games since the 1994 season, beating the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card Round and the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game 21\u201312. In the 2007 AFC Championship Game, Rivers' was lauded by his teammates and the press for playing the entire game with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which later required surgery and was ranked among the NFL Top 10 Gutsiest Performances. Chris Harry of the Orlando Sentinel said \"I don't think anyone will ever accuse Philip Rivers of being soft.\" Kevin Acee of The San Diego Union-Tribune said, \"To go out there and put his knee, and ultimately his career, on the line. It has to go down as one of the gutsiest performances.\" ====2008 season==== Kansas City in 2008 In 2008, Rivers led the NFL in multiple categories including touchdown passes (34), passer rating (105.5), yards per pass attempt (8.4), and adjusted yards per attempt (8.8). In Week 2, against the Denver Broncos, he had a season-high 377 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 39\u201338 loss. On December 28, 2008, Rivers set the Chargers team record for touchdown passes in a season with 34, a record previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 33 in 1981. After a 4\u20138 start, Rivers threw 11 touchdown passes and one interception to win the final four games of the season, winning the AFC West division on a season-finale 52\u201321 tie-breaking win over the Denver Broncos. On January 3, 2009, in the Wild Card Round, the San Diego Chargers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff. Rivers led the Chargers down the field down three points with under two minutes left. He set up Nate Kaeding for a game-tying field goal that would lead to overtime, where the Chargers would go on to win 23\u201317, thanks to a Darren Sproles touchdown. In the Divisional Round 35\u201324 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rivers played well, throwing for over 300 yards and three touchdowns, but was sacked four times and threw an interception. They possessed the ball for only 17 seconds during the third quarter and had only 15 yards rushing. ====2009 season==== On August 24, 2009, Rivers signed a six-year, $92 million contract extension with the Chargers, with approximately $38 million guaranteed. Rivers was voted into his second career Pro Bowl on December 29. He ended the season with a passer rating of 104.4, the third highest in the NFL, after passing for 4,254 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only nine interceptions. For the second consecutive year, he led the NFL in yards per attempt (8.8) and adjusted yards per attempt (9.1). He led the Chargers to the second seed in the AFC with a 13\u20133 record, tied for second best in the NFL. In the Divisional Round, Rivers was 27\u201340 for 298 yards while rushing and throwing for a touchdown and was intercepted twice in the 17\u201314 loss to the New York Jets. ====2010 season==== Rivers led the league in passing yards, throwing for a career-high 4,710 yards \u2013 10 yards more than second-place finisher, Peyton Manning. The Chargers started off the year slowly again at 3\u20135 and finished a disappointing 9\u20137 and their four-year reign as AFC West champions ended while they missed the playoffs. In Week 3 against the Seattle Seahawks, Rivers threw for 455 yards and two passing touchdowns in a losing effort 20\u201327. These 455 yards broke the franchise single-game record for most passing yardage, previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 444 in 1982. Rivers recorded 431 and threw two passing touchdowns, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in Week 5. In Week 8, Rivers threw for 305 yards, with two passing touchdowns and one interception in a 33\u201325 win against the Tennessee Titans, extending his active player-leading streak to 21 games with a touchdown thrown and giving him the record for most passing yards (2,649) ever after 8 games, passing Fouts' previous record (2,580). Rivers threw for four passing touchdowns, two to backup tight end Randy McMichael and the other two to rookie receiver Seyi Ajirotutu in a comeback 29\u201323 victory over the Houston Texans. The Chargers' top receivers Gates (torn plantar fascia), Vincent Jackson (suspended), Malcom Floyd (hamstring), and Legedu Naanee (hamstring) did not play in the game. Rivers lost his first ever game in December, a 13\u201328 loss at home against the Oakland Raiders. Rivers was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, his fourth invite overall, and started in place of an injured Tom Brady. It was the first time he played in a Pro Bowl, twice missing previous games due to injury and once for the birth of his child in the 2010 Pro Bowl. Rivers was named the quarterback in the 2010 NFL Alumni Player of the Year Awards over Brady, who was unanimously named The Associated Press 2010 Most Valuable Player. ====2011 season==== Entering the 2011 season, Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune called Rivers a \"better quarterback\" than Fouts, a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback. Canepa cited Rivers \"[completing] passes to an astounding 17 different receivers\" in 2010, amid the injuries to Chargers receivers, and his then 55\u201325 record as a starter compared to 86\u201384\u20131 for Fouts. He also noted, \"Fouts made more mistakes than Rivers.\" Rivers had completed 63.7 percent of his 2,455 passes with 58 interceptions and a 97.2 passer rating, while Fouts was successful on 58.8 percent of his 5,604 attempts with 242 interceptions and an 80.2 rating. Rivers had never thrown more than two interceptions in a game, including seven playoff games. His passer rating was the highest in league history, and he had the second-best touchdown-to-interception ratio of all-time (136/58). Rivers and the Chargers started out the season with a 24\u201317 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Rivers had 335 passing yards and two touchdowns thrown to fullback Mike Tolbert. He threw two interceptions for the first time in his career. Rivers and the Chargers lost 35\u201321 in Foxboro to the New England Patriots in Week 2. Rivers threw for 378 passing yards and had two touchdown passes to Vincent Jackson but also threw two interceptions again. Rivers threw two interceptions for the third game in a row as the Chargers held off the winless Kansas City Chiefs in Week 3, 20\u201317. In Week 4, the Chargers beat the winless Miami Dolphins 26\u201316, and Rivers threw a 55-yard touchdown to Vincent Jackson. In Week 5, Rivers threw for 250 yards and a touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd. He added a rushing touchdown as well. Despite two turnovers by him, the Chargers held off the Denver Broncos by a score of 29\u201324. Rivers struggled in Week 7 after the bye. Rex Ryan's New York Jets limited Rivers to 179 passing yards and two interceptions. He did throw a touchdown to Antonio Gates, his first of the year. The Chargers lost 23\u201320 to the Chiefs in overtime on Halloween. Rivers put up 369 yards, but had two interceptions and a crushing fumble. Rivers' poor performance during the 2011 season led to media speculation that he may have been suffering from an undisclosed injury. His former teammate, LaDainian Tomlinson, speculated that Rivers might be distracted by the burden of being the Chargers' star player. Rivers had 385 yards passing and added four touchdowns, but threw three interceptions against the defending champion Green Bay Packers. Rivers threw for 274 passing yards and an interception and a fumble in a 24\u201317 Week 10 loss against the Oakland Raiders. He did however, throw two passing touchdowns to rookie Vincent Brown. Rivers threw for 280 yards and two passing touchdowns in a 31\u201320 loss to the Chicago Bears. He added 2 more interceptions thrown. The touchdown passes went to Antonio Gates and Vincent Jackson. The Chargers lost 16\u201313 in overtime to Tim Tebow and the Broncos. Rivers threw for 188 yards and a touchdown to Antonio Gates. The Chargers finally won a game in Week 13, dominating the Jacksonville Jaguars 38\u201314. Rivers finished with 294 passing yards and 3 touchdowns. Rivers and the Chargers dominated the Buffalo Bills in Week 14, winning 37\u201310. Philip threw for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns, 2 to Antonio Gates, and Patrick Crayton. Rivers and the Chargers dominated the Baltimore Ravens in Week 15. Philip had 270 yards and a touchdown to Malcom Floyd in a 34\u201314 stomping. Rivers and the Chargers struggled in Week 16. On Christmas Eve, the Chargers fell 38\u201310 in Detroit to the Lions. Rivers had 299 passing yards and a touchdown, but two interceptions. Rivers concluded the season by throwing for 310 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, which were received by Floyd, Jackson, and Gates, in a 38\u201326 win against the Oakland Raiders, ending the Raiders' playoff hopes that season. He was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season. ====2012 season==== The Chargers began the 2012 season with a 3\u20131 record for the second consecutive season. In a 37\u201320 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4, Rivers started his 100th career game, which was also his 100th consecutive start. On November 1, in the second game against the Kansas City Chiefs, he was 18-of-20 passes to earn a career-high 90% completion percentage in the 31\u201313 victory. Rivers became the seventh fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 25,000 career yards. With a weak offensive line that season, Rivers was frequently forced to scramble and was sacked 49 times and hit on 70 other plays, contributing to his 22 turnovers\u201447 over the previous two seasons. The Chargers' 7\u20139 record was the first losing season in Rivers's career, and the team's first since 2003. They missed the playoffs for the third straight season, leading to the firing of Turner and general manager A. J. Smith. ====2013 season==== Rivers in playoffs against Denver during 2013 season Rivers's combined 35 interceptions the two previous seasons led many to wonder whether he was injured or if his career was on the decline. Only two offensive coaches returned in 2013 in an overhauled coaching staff led by new head coach Mike McCoy, and a revamped offensive system had Rivers release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded. In their Week 2 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, he threw for 419 yards and three touchdowns. In their Week 4 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Rivers set an NFL record for completion percentage (83%) for a quarterback who also threw for over 400 yards (401), three touchdowns, and one interception. In Week 7, Rivers surpassed 30,000 career yards passing. Rivers was also selected to the Pro Bowl for the fifth time in his career. In Week 17 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Rivers led a fourth quarter and overtime comeback to win the game, and clinch the 6th seed in the AFC playoffs. During the Chargers season-ending four-game winning streak, Rivers completed 67.3 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and a 142.6 rating. He finished the season completing 378 of 544 passes (69.5 percent) for 4,478 yards, 32 touchdowns and just 11 interceptions; his 105.5 passer rating tied his career high from 2008. With the Chargers having a capable running attack, an adjusted offensive line, and an improved defense, Rivers was not pressured to force his throws, and he led all quarterbacks in the league with a 49.4 third-down conversion rate when passing. He led the Chargers to a 27\u201310 win in the Wild Card Round against the Cincinnati Bengals before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round, 24\u201317. He was named Comeback Player of the Year by both Associated Press (AP) and Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA). ====2014 season==== Philip Rivers against the Arizona Cardinals in 2014 season debut The Chargers in 2014 lost their final game of the season when a win would have qualified them for the playoffs. Rivers was sacked a career-high seven times in the loss. For the season, he was voted by the Chargers as their MVP after finishing with 4,286 yards, 31 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. It was the sixth season in which he passed for over 4,000 yards. During Weeks 2\u20136, he became the first NFL player ever to have a passer rating over 120 for five consecutive games. Later in the season, Rivers suffered from sore ribs and a back injury, but he denied that they affected his performance. His 71.2 rating in December was his lowest in a single month since November 2007 (68.8). ====2015 season==== On August 15, 2015, the Chargers and Rivers agreed to a four-year, $84 million contract extension. Rivers started the 2015 season with 403 passing yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 33\u201328 victory over the Detroit Lions. On September 20, Rivers threw his 255th touchdown pass as a Charger, passing Dan Fouts as the franchise leader in touchdown passes. On October 18, in a game against the Green Bay Packers, Rivers set franchise records with 503 passing yards, 43 completions, and 65 attempts. In Week 12, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 300 passing yards and season-high four passing touchdowns. The Chargers finished with a 4\u201312 record, last in the AFC West, their worst record since 2003. The Chargers went winless against divisional opponents for the first time since 1984. Despite the disappointing season, Rivers set career highs and franchise records with 437 pass completions on 661 pass attempts and 4,792 passing yards, which ranked second among NFL quarterbacks in 2015. He finished 11 yards short of breaking the franchise single-season passing yards record held by Fouts. Rivers was invited to the 2016 Pro Bowl as an alternate but declined the invitation, citing personal reasons. He was ranked 46th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. ====2016 season==== Denver in 2016 Rivers started the 2016 season with 243 passing yards and a touchdown in a 33\u201327 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

She converted to the Catholic faith. They have nine children, and reside in Hamilton County, Indiana. On January 31, 2010, Philip and Tiffany Rivers' daughter, Sarah Catherine, was born. He had been selected to the AFC Pro Bowl team the same year, but he did not make it to the game in South Florida due to her birth. In an interview with NFL Network on the June 10, 2011, Rivers stated the family was expecting their sixth child. On October 28, 2013, Philip and Tiffany welcomed their seventh child. In April 2015, Rivers and his wife confirmed they were expecting their eighth child. On October 28, 2015, their daughter Clare was born. According to a 2017 story by San Diego Union-Tribune reporter Kevin Acee, > Rivers lives as about as modestly as one can when his career earnings are > bumping up against $200 million. His primary mode of transportation is a > 2008 Ford F250. He wears cowboy boots \u2013 real ones, plain brown, nothing made > of a swamp creature or rare bird. His dress shirts are Western cut and have > shiny buttons. Despite his simple tastes, he made a major investment in a customized SUV shortly after the Chargers' move to the Los Angeles area. Rivers and his wife had toured schools and neighborhoods in Orange County, more specifically in the general vicinity of the Chargers' new Costa Mesa practice facility, during the 2017 offseason, but decided not to move. In order to make the one-way commute productive, he spent roughly $200,000 to convert a large SUV into a rolling film room. The rear seats were torn out and replaced by two forward- facing, fully reclining seats; a TV screen was installed in the cabin divider; and satellite TV, Wi-Fi, and a cooler were also installed. The setup, including a driver that Rivers hired, allows him to analyze game videos during the commute. As he would tell Acee, > My two biggest things were my family time and my preparation and what I owe > this football team. I was not going to sacrifice either of them in any big > proportion. I can look at all the pluses and minuses and say, \u2018OK. This does > it.\u2019 This allows me to get home in the 6 to 7 hour, which is when I got home > the last 11 years, and it allows me to watch all or more of the film I > watched before. In 2011, he was named one of three finalists for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award for his work with the Rivers of Hope Foundation, an endeavor he and his wife oversaw from 2010 to 2012 to help foster children. The Foundation raised more than $1,000,000 for the cause through football camps, a 5K Fun Run and personal contributions from Rivers. The Foundation supported the San Pasqual Academy, a residential education campus designed specifically for foster teens. Rivers comes from an athletic family. He, his father Steve, and his younger brother Stephen have all played college football. Steve played linebacker at Mississippi State in the 1970s. Stephen committed to play college football at Louisiana State University (LSU) after attending Austin High School and Athens High School. On June 5, 2014, he transferred to Vanderbilt University and was eligible to play immediately, but wound up transferring to Northwestern State University for the 2015 season. Rivers received an Honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters and addressed the Class of 2014 at the 125th Annual Commencement Ceremony of The Catholic University of America (CUA) on May 17, 2014. In 2014, Rivers was part of a campaign to benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego. ==See also== * List of 500-yard passing games in the National Football League * List of most consecutive starts and games played by National Football League players * List of National Football League career passer rating leaders * List of National Football League career quarterback wins leaders * List of National Football League quarterback playoff records * List of NCAA Division I FBS career passing touchdowns leaders * List of NCAA Division I FBS career passing yards leaders * List of NCAA major college football yearly passing leaders * List of North Carolina State University people ==References== ==External links== *Indianapolis Colts bio *Los Angeles Chargers bio Category:1981 births Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Catholics from Alabama Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Living people Category:Los Angeles Chargers players Category:NC State Wolfpack football players Category:People from Athens, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Sportspeople from Decatur, Alabama Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players ",
