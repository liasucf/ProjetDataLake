It was founded in 1900 with headquarters in Hanoi in what was then French Indochina. After the independence of Vietnam, its headquarters were transferred to Phnom Penh in 1957 and subsequently to Paris in 1975. Its main fields of research are archaeology, philology and the study of modern Asian societies. Since 1907, the EFEO has been in charge of conservation work at the archeological site of Angkor. == EFEO romanization system == A romanization system for Mandarin was developed by the EFEO. It shares a few similarities with Wade-Giles and Hanyu Pinyin. In modern times, it has been superseded by Hanyu Pinyin. The differences between the three romanization systems are shown in the following table: {|class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! IPA ! EFEO ! WG !
