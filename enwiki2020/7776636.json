The Headmistress is Nicola MacGlashan who joined the school in August 2014. In 2012, it was ranked the 7th best state school in Scotland by the percentage of fifth years attaining at least five Higher passes. == Previous building and fire == The original building, completed in 1962, was partially destroyed in a large fire in 1975. It caused many pupils to be transferred to other schools while the building was demolished and replaced with a newer building. Some pupils were housed in a temporary structure made out of portable units that was reinforced by a brick built super structure at the back of the school grounds - this was built to be a temporary home for the upper school while the new main building was built and was intended to be pulled down once the new part of the school opened, with a maximum life of around 3 years. It was finally demolished in 2005 as part of the extension work, 30 years after it was first built. On the site of this building, called the Westfield Building, is a new large car park.Welcome to The Woodfarm High School December newsletter, Woodfarm High School, 1 December 2012 The original Woodfarm consisted of four separate buildings, one with all general departments including gym, office and management facilities, another with Art and Information Technology departments and the final with English, Maths, Science and Home Economics. The fire destroyed the English and Science departments. The English and Maths building was also named the \"Westfield Building\".
