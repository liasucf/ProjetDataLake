    "text": "Blaberus is a genus of cockroaches generally found in South America. About 19 species are in the genus, and they are popular among hobbyists as feed for other arthropods (Blaberus discoidalis in particular serves this function) or as pets. Unlike several genera of cockroaches considered to be pests, this genus keeps its ootheca in its abdomen until the time it hatches. They generally require a relative humidity of 60% or higher to thrive and temperatures above 25 \u00b0C (28-30 \u00b0C is best) to reproduce. B. giganteus is one of the world's longest roaches. B. craniifer's popular name, \"death's head roach\" is often attributed to B. discoidalis, as well. This genus contains these species: * Blaberus affinis Jurberg, Albuquerque, Rebordoes, Goncalves & Felippe, 1977 * Blaberus anisitsi Brancsik, 1898 * Blaberus asellus (Thunberg, 1826) * Blaberus atropos (Stoll, 1813) (= \"Blaberus fusca\") * Blaberus boliviensis Princis, 1946 * Blaberus brasilianus Saussure, 1864 * Blaberus colosseus (Illiger, 1801) * Blaberus craniifer Burmeister, 1838 * Blaberus discoidalis Serville, 1839 * Blaberus duckei Jurberg, Albuquerque, Rebordoes, Goncalves & Felippe, 1977 * Blaberus fusiformis Walker, 1868 * Blaberus giganteus (Linnaeus, 1758) * Blaberus latissimus (Herbst, 1786) * Blaberus matogrossensis Rocha e Silva & Aguiar, 1977 * Blaberus minor Saussure, 1864 * Blaberus parabolicus Walker, 1868 * Blaberus paulistanus Lopes & de Oliveira, 2000 * Blaberus peruvianus Jurberg, Albuquerque, Rebordoes, Goncalves & Felippe, 1977 * Blaberus scutatus Saussure & Zehntner, 1894 == References == Category:Cockroach genera ",
