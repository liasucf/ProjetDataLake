    "text": "The is a biography of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who rose to the office of taik\u014d during the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period of Japanese history. The Confucian scholar (1564\u20131640) published the work in 1626 during the rule of the third Tokugawa sh\u014dgun Iemitsu. The work was published five times between 1626 and 1710. The complete work spans 22 scrolls. The Taik\u014dki shows the influence of Hoan's individual views of history and interpretations of historical materials. Modern historical novels based on the Taik\u014dki include the Shinsho Taik\u014dki by Eiji Yoshikawa, Ihon Taik\u014dki by S\u014dhachi Yamaoka, and Shinshi Taik\u014dki by Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba. Yoshikawa's novel was the basis for the yearlong NHK television Taiga drama Taik\u014dki (1965). Shiba's novel and others of his works gave the story to Kunitori Monogatari (1973), another Taiga drama. ==References== Category:Edo-period works Category:Toyotomi clan ",
