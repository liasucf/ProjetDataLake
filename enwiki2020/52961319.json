    "text": "The Turkish Constitutional Reform were amendments made to the Constitution of Turkey in 2017. The reform was backed by the governing Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party. The reform altered the elections of the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors, the Presidency, and the Parliament. It saw the transformation of Turkey's semi-presidential system into a presidential one with the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister of Turkey and the transfer of executive authority to the President of Turkey. ==Constitutional amendments== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |- ! colspan=3| Description of proposed amendments |- !

In addition, all parties are required to field 5% more candidates than there are seats available in a given constituency, with a minimum of two extra candidates, in case all the constituency candidates of a party are elected. Independent candidates are required to field one reserve independent candidate when running for election.
