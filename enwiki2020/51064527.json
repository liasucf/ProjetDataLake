    "text": "Kongelig historiograf (Historicus Regius, \"Historiographer Royal\") was a position in the kingdom of Denmark-Norway (after 1814 Denmark) between 1594 and 1883. The parallel office in Sweden was established in 1618, in England in 1660 and in Scotland in 1681. The office was originally created with the aim of producing a national history of Denmark from the 13th century, a \"continuation of Saxo\", improving upon the first such work, published in the vernacular in 1600 by Arild Huitfeldt. The office is not to be confused with that of kongelig ordenshistoriograf, the position of official historian of the Danish system of orders which was established in 1808 and remains in existence today.
