    "text": "Sobiranistes () is a political party of the republican and Catalan sovereigntist left, formed by a splinter group from Catalunya en Com\u00fa (CatCom\u00fa) led by Joan Josep Nuet and Elisenda Alamany, deputies in the Parliament of Catalonia. == History == Sobiranistes was initially constituted on 23 October 2018 as a political platform the Catalunya en Com\u00fa\u2013Podem group in the Parliament of Catalonia by deputies Elisenda Alamany and Joan Josep Nuet, under the Som comuns, som sobiranistes (We are common, we are sovereigntist) motto. The goal of the platform was to \"right\" the course of the perceived drift of CatCom\u00fa towards \"the vices of traditional parties\", were very critical of the role of Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV) within the party, and accused CatCom\u00fa's leader Ada Colau of having \"abandoned sovereigntism\" and of \"disbanding Xavier Dom\u00e8nech's team\", after the latter's resigned as Podemos regional secretary-general and Catalan deputy. CatCom\u00fa's leadership would criticize Alamany for \"poor transparency\" as well as the platform's establishment not being done according to internal party procedures. Sobiranistes was formally registered as a party on 21 February 2019, with Alamany and Nuet breaking up from Catalunya en Com\u00fa, and subsequently entering coalition talks with Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) ahead of the April 2019 Spanish general election. Such alliance was formalized in March under the Republican Left of Catalonia\u2013Sovereigntists label, with the agreement providing for Sobiranistes to field candidates within ERC's list for Barcelona. The alliance was maintained for the November 2019 general election. Alamany also registered the Nova\u2013New Future () political party on 11 March, reaching an agreement with ERC to support Ernest Maragall's run to the mayorship of Barcelona in the 2019 municipal election. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sobiranistes broke ERC's group discipline in several occasions by abstaining\u2014rather than opposing\u2014in the votings for the proroguing of the state of alarm. ==Electoral performance== ===Cortes Generales=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:left;\" |- | colspan=\"10\" align=\"center\"| Cortes Generales |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"75\"| Election ! colspan=\"5\"| Congress ! colspan=\"2\"| Senate ! rowspan=\"2\"| Leading candidate ! rowspan=\"2\"| Status in legislature |- ! width=\"70\"| Votes ! width=\"35\"| % ! width=\"25\"| # !
