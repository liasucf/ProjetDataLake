The watch is available in 36 mm and 40 mm variants, available in various colours and in silicone, leather and woven straps. It pairs with a smartphone with the Nokia Health Mate application and also relays smartphone notifications. Steel HR features a heart rate monitor and is water resistant. It was the major smartwatch carrying the Nokia brand, until the company sold back the health division to the co-founder of Withings in September 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nokia Category:Smartwatches Category:Smart bands ",
