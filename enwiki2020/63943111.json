    "text": "DigitaOS was a short lived digital camera operating system created by Flashpoint Technology and used on various Kodak, Pentax, and HP cameras in the late 1990s. DigitaOS debuted with the Kodak DC220 on , and was released on a total of 11 camera models before it was abandoned in 2001. DigitaOS was notable for its ability to run third party software, a concept that was not again realized until the release of various Android based digital cameras in the early 2010s. DigitaOS applications were programmed either as JIT compiled scripts using \"Digita Script\", or AOT compiled programs written in C using an official SDK. The operating system abstracted away most camera functionality and hardware platform differences, allowing software to be compatible with most DigitaOS cameras. Additionally, DigitaOS handled the GUI presented to the user and basic camera functionality. Because of its ability to run third party software, several games were ported to it. The most notable of these being DOOM and MAME. == Cameras using DigitaOS == * Kodak DC220 * Kodak DC260 * Kodak DC265 * Kodak DC290 * Minolta Dimage 1500 EX * Minolta 1500 3D * HP C500 Photosmart * HP C618 Photosmart * HP C912 Photosmart * PENTAX EI-200 * PENTAX EI-2000 == References == Category:1998 software Category:Discontinued operating systems ",
