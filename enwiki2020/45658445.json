The lineup consisted of Sativa Novak on vocals and keyboards, Clint Yeager on bass, DD Ehrlich on guitars, and Tom Curry on drums. They have remained inactive since releasing their album, EXACTLY what You ThiNk It Is. ==Formation and EXACTLY what You ThiNk It Is (1996\u20132007)== In 1996, ex- DaisyFace members Sativa Novak and Dev Gilmore joined forces with ex-Wicked Jester guitarist Daniel \"DD\" Ehrlich to form S\u00f6uR. Ex-Wicked Jester drummer Rob Wood was on loan and recorded a 3-song EP, including \u201cAmber Glo\u201d and \u201cMe\u201d, co-produced by Ken Van Druten and Robert Long, recorded and mixed by Mike Plotnikoff at A&M;, Ocean and One on One Studios. Rob Wood was replaced by Brett Kerr for shows and then by Wade Murff. Dev Gilmore was replaced by Clint Yeager (DaisyFace, SuperFiends, Nova Cycle) on bass and the band went on to record \u201cAm I Evil\u201d at Rockline Radio, for Cleopatra Record\u2019s A Punk Tribute to Metallica in 2000. After one final lineup change, replacing Wade Murff with Tom Curry on drums and playing local shows with bands like Duff McKagen\u2019s Loaded, Otep, Pauley Parette\u2019s Lo-Ball, Ima Robot and Taime Downe\u2019s Newlydeads, S\u00f6uR went back into the studio to record Exactly What You Think It Is in 2002, produced and mixed by Greg Fidelman at Grand Master Recorders, Cello and Sound City. In 2003 the band self-released their record and garnered a few reviews, chart positions and TV placements but failed to pickup tour support. One reviewer from Allmusic even stated that \"the group showed great potential\", but claimed that \"the group would be unstoppable if they were more extreme.\" Stranded in Los Angeles, the band disbanded. ==Discography== *EXACTLY what You ThiNk It Is (2003) - Grey Goo Transmissions ==Members== ;Past members *Sativa Novak - Vocals, guitars, keyboards (1996\u20132007) *DD Ehrlich - Guitars, programming (1996\u20132007) *Dev Gilmore - Bass (1996\u20132000) *Clint Yeager - Bass (2000\u20132007) *Rob Wood - Drums (1996\u20131998) *Brett Kerr - Drums (1998\u20132000) *Wade Murff - Drums (2000\u20132001) *Tom Curry - Drums (2001\u20132007) ==References== Category:American industrial rock musical groups ",
