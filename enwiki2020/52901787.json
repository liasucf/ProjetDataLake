It was triggered by the resignation of Arthur Tonkin (the sitting Labor member) on 18 March 1987. The election was won by Labor's Frank Donovan, with the party suffering a small swing against it from the 1986 state election. ==Background== Arthur Tonkin, a former schoolteacher, had held Morley-Swan for the Labor Party since the seat's creation at the 1983 state election. He had served in parliament since the 1971 election, and represented Mirrabooka and Morley before transferring to Morley-Swan.
