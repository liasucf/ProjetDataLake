    "text": "Venture is a weekly Canadian business television series that aired on CBC Television from 1985 to 2007. The show focused mostly on business documentaries, but also aired business-related news pieces. In the beginning, Venture was hosted by Patrick Watson, who previously hosted the controversial but wildly popular Sunday evening news program This Hour has Seven Days in the 1960s. The program was hosted for most of its run by Robert Scully, and in its final years by Dianne Buckner. Venture's special features are documentary pieces called Back to the Floor, in which a chief executive officer works at an entry-level job within their own company for a day. On 4 April 2007, CBC announced the cancellation of Venture. Episodes were broadcast on Sundays until 2 September 2007. ==External links== * CBC Digital Archives \u2013 Venture Category:1985 Canadian television series debuts Category:2007 Canadian television series endings Category:CBC Television original programming Category:CBC News Category:1980s Canadian television news shows Category:1990s Canadian television news shows Category:2000s Canadian television news shows Category:Business mass media in Canada Category:Television news program articles using incorrect naming style ",
