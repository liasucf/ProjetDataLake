    "text": "The Jinapanjara (; , Chinabanchon), sometimes known in English as \"The Cage of the Conqueror\", is a post-canonical paritta Buddhist chant. It is one of the most popular texts that is widely chanted in Thailand. It has existed since the end of the nineteenth century, from the time of the reign of Rama II. It is assumed that the Jinapanjara was authored by a Lanna Buddhist monk. Later, the monk Somdej Toh modified the incantation and made it more complete, by translating the content and curtailing some parts in the chant with unknown meaning. The text can also be found in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. == Terminology == The meaning of Jinapanjara is 'the armor of the Buddha'. Jinapanjara is the combination of two words, Jina meaning 'the winner', which is the Buddha, and Panjara meaning 'cage'. Thus, Jinapanjara means 'the cage (which is strong as a piece of armor) that can protect from any dangers and enemies'. == History == Historians have found no evidence of the original author, nor where Jinapanjara was composed, but the text is mentioned in ancient Birmese scriptures. The scriptures state that Jinapanjara was written in Chiang Mai in the era of King Anawrahta Minsaw(1578\u20131607). Because of the popularity of animistic rituals considered in violation of Buddhist principles, Anawrahta consulted with the monastic community and decreed to his citizens to chant the Jinapanjara text instead. Hence, Jinapanjara was authored by Thai monks in Chiang Mai and its chanting became widespread in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. There are two well-known adaptations of the Jinapanjara in Thailand. The first version was adapted by Somdej Toh at Wat Rakhangkhositraram Woramahavihan and was further revised by Pra Pattaramuni at Wat Thong Noppakun. Another version was adapted by Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana. Both version have the same meaning, but differ slightly in pronunciation and spelling. == See also == * Buddhist chant * Samatha * Tantric Theravada == References == == External links == * Full text of the Junapanjara in Pali language, with Thai translation * Jinapanjara, rendered in Thai chanting style, with a music score Category:Pali Buddhist texts Category:Buddhist chants ",
