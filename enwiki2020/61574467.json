    "text": "James Lee Williams, better known by the stage name The Vivienne, is a British drag queen, known for being appointed the first UK RuPaul's Drag Race ambassador in 2015, and winning the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019. As part of her victory, she was awarded her own online television series, later titled The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood. The series premiered on 9 April 2020 on BBC Three and follows her trip to Hollywood to produce her own music video. ==Career== The Vivienne chose her name because she was known for wearing Vivienne Westwood, adding the definite article to make it unique. She has worked in many Liverpool bars, including Superstar Boudoir, GBar and Heaven. In May 2015, she was crowned the UK Ambassador of RuPaul's Drag Race. On 21 August 2019, Vivienne was announced as one of the ten contestants to be competing in the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK. In September 2019, she participated in Jag Race, a racing competition in collaboration with Jaguar Cars. Vivienne raced for Sahir House; a charity that provides a space in which people can speak freely without fear of prejudice, stigma, abuse or exploitation in relation to HIV, based in its hometown of Liverpool. In November 2019, she was crowned the first winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK. In November to December 2019, Vivienne, alongside the cast of the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, embarked on a tour, hosted by Drag Race alum Alyssa Edwards. In December 2019, The Vivienne alongside fellow RuPaul's Drag Race UK contestant Baga Chipz began starring in Morning T&T; on WOW Presents Plus. The show sees The Vivienne and Baga reprise their Snatch Game impersonations of Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher, respectively, to host fictional television news show, and consisted of six episodes as of January 2020. At DragCon UK in January 2020 an additional episode was filmed with The Vivienne and Baga appearing as themselves. Guests on the web series included fellow Drag Race UK alumni Sum Ting Wong as Queen Elizabeth II and Cheryl Hole as Gemma Collins. In March 2020, World of Wonder announced a six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood, documenting The Vivienne travelling to Los Angeles in order to make a music video. The show premiered on BBC Three on 9 April, and simultaneously started streaming on WOW Presents Plus. That same month, The Vivienne, once again alongside Baga Chipz, started presenting the UK version of I Like to Watch, a web series produced by Netflix in which they humorously review Netflix programming. She has since appeared on Celebrity Juice. In July 2020, The Vivienne voiced as Donald Trump in the BBC Three documentary Trump in Tweets. ==Personal life== Williams was married in 2019. He is also known for his strong Liverpool accent that he uses comedically in his drag performances. == Discography == === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Song ! |- |2020 |\"Tonight\" | |} ===As Featured Artist=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5em;\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| US Elec. |- | \"Break Up (Bye Bye)\" (Filth Harmony Version) (The Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race UK) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | 34 || 45 | rowspan=2 |- | \"To the Moon\" (Cast Version) (RuPaul ft.
