His brothers were Dionisio Chamorro Alfaro and Fernando Chamorro Alfaro. Dionisio was married to Mercedes Oreamuno ... and had two sons, Salvador Chamorro Oreamuno and Rosendo Chamorro Oreamuno, President of Nicaragua, the first of whom married Gregoria Vargas B\u00e1ez and had Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, 55th and 59th President of Nicaragua. By Josefa Per\u00e9z ... his father had a natural son, born before his marriage, Fruto Chamorro P\u00e9rez, 30th and 31st President of Nicaragua. His great-grandfather was Spanish Nobleman Diego Chamorro de Sotomayor y Murga de Villavicencio, born in Seville, who married no less than five times: to his great-grandmother Gregoria Lacayo de Briones y Pomar, In\u00e9s de Villa-Nueva y ..., Juana Fajardo y ..., Gertrudis de Pasos y ... and Rafaela Occonor y Salafranca, by whom he had a daughter Josefa Chamorro Occonor (1784 - 1843). ==Career== At an early age, he left off studies to dedicate himself, together with his brother Dionisio, to the management of paternal inheritances under the guidance of their half-brother Fruto Chamorro. His first marriage was to N. Guadamuz; his second marriage was in 1854 with Mar\u00eda de la Luz Bola\u00f1os Benda\u00f1a, born in 1828. They had three children: * Filadelfo Chamorro Bola\u00f1os, married to Bertha Benard Vivas, and had: ** Julio Chamorro Benard, married to Dolores \"Lola\" Coronel Urtecho, daughter of Manuel Coronel Matus and wife Blanca Urtecho Avil\u00e9s and sister of Jos\u00e9 Coronel Urtecho, and had: *** Edgar Chamorro Coronel, Chief of the Contras *** Other six sons and four daughters * Diego Manuel Chamorro Bola\u00f1os, 56th President of Nicaragua * Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Bola\u00f1os, married to his cousin Ana Mar\u00eda Zelaya Bola\u00f1os, and had: ** Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Zelaya, married to Margarita Cardenal Arg\u00fcello, daughter of Julio Cardenal Arg\u00fcello and wife and cousin Adela Arg\u00fcello Cervantes and maternal granddaughter of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arg\u00fcello Pe\u00f1alba and wife Mar\u00eda Cervantes Montalv\u00e1n, and had: *** Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal *** Ana Mar\u00eda Chamorro Cardenal, married to Carlos Holmann Thompson, and had: **** Eduardo Holmann Chamorro **** Ver\u00f3nica Holmann Chamorro **** Hugo Holmann Chamorro **** Ana Carolina Holmann Chamorro **** Bruno Holmann Chamorro **** Ericka Holmann Chamorro **** Juan Lorenzo Holmann Chamorro *** Ligia Chamorro y Cardenal ****Ximena Barreto ****Samuel Barreto ****Leonardo Barreto ****Juan Diego Barreto ****Dominica Barreto ****Paola Barreto *** Jaime Chamorro y Cardenal *** Xavier Chamorro Cardenal In 1849 Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro became mayor of Granada and in 1854, he participated in the defense of the city, besieged by M\u00e1ximo Jerez. He also contributed to the struggle to expel William Walker, the American filibuster. In 1862 he dedicated himself to politics as Senator of the Department of Granada. In 1869, he became a member of the governing junta of Nicaragua. He was elected president in 1871 for four years, and again joined the ruling junta in 1885. In both his public and private life, Don Pedro was considered progressive by some and an opportunist by many others, when conservative forces would keep \"campesinos\" without access to education,. He represented a faction of the Granada oligarchy and maintained strong conservative principles, which in Latin America meant the preservation of a feudal economic system, with an emphasis on trade. His influence would help form Nicaragua as a nation with the limitations of keeping the country and its economic resources under the control of a few families including the Chamorro and the few other families that still control Nicaragua economically today. He remained a political force in Nicaragua until his death on 7 June 1890. ==References== * Recorrido Historico de las Principales Figuras de la Familia Chamorro, Emilio Alvarez Lejarza, Revista Consevadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano, Vol. XIX - No. 91 (Abril, 1968) * Revisando la Historia de Nicaragua - 2004 Category:1818 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Presidents of Nicaragua Pedro Joaquin Chamorro y Alfaro Category:Conservative Party (Nicaragua) politicians Category:19th-century Nicaraguan people ",
