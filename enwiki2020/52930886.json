    "text": "Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War is a 2015 comic book miniseries featuring a crossover of characters from the DC Comics franchise Green Lantern, and the science fiction franchise Star Trek. The Star Trek characters include the Enterprise crew, depicted as they are in the J. J. Abrams trilogy. Star Trek/Green Lantern: Stranger Worlds is the sequel. ==Plot== In an alternate DC universe, the last Guardian, Ganthet, exercises his power to take one each of the remaining power rings to another universe in order to escape Nekron, the embodiment of death (seen in the Blackest Night series), who has destroyed almost all life in the universe. In the Star Trek Kelvin Universe, the crew of the Enterprise discover the remains of Ganthet and the power rings on a rogue planet. They accidentally activate the power rings even as they come under attack by a squad of Klingon ships under the command of General Chang. The blue, indigo, and violet rings find new owners among the crew of the Enterprise (Chekov, McCoy, and Uhura, respectively), while the yellow ring finds a new home with Chang. The red and orange rings head into space, eventually finding owners with the son of the leader of the Gorn Hegemony and the Praetor of the Romulan Empire, respectively. Hal Jordan arrives, wondering why Ganthet's body is on board the Enterprise, and not long after, Carol Ferris (Star Sapphire) and an injured Saint Walker arrive. Meanwhile, Sinestro, Larfleeze, and Atrocitus have also survived, and contact their respective color rings' new owners. Battle ensues, and it is discovered that three other Green Lanterns -- John Stewart, Guy Gardner, and Kilowog, have survived the death of their universe, but what no one has counted on is that Nekron has also made his way to the new universe, and is determined to slaughter it as he did his own, and starts by restoring the destroyed planet Vulcan, and making Black Lanterns out of the populace. Ultimately, Nekron is defeated by combining the ring energies. Sinestro, Atrocitus, and Larfleeze escape. The Green Lanterns, as well as Star Sapphire and Saint Walker, either join the crew of the Enterprise, or venture to the Earth of the Star Trek Kelvin universe. ==Reception== The comic received mostly positive reviews. ==References== Category:2015 comics debuts Category:Green Lantern titles Category:Intercompany crossovers Category:Comics based on Star Trek Category:IDW Publishing titles Category:Fiction set in the 23rd century ",
