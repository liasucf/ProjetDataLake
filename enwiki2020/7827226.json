She was best known for her rendition of \"In the Good Old Summer Time.\" ==Early life and family== Blanche Ring was born in Boston, Massachusetts to James H. Ring and Wilhelmena F. Ring. She came from show business stock. Her father was a comedian for 30 years and her grandfather James H. Ring, was a leading comedian of the Boston Museum company. Her great- great-grandfather, Charles Fisher, was also an actor and came to the United States from England. He journeyed with theatrical caravans as far west as the Mississippi River. Her heritage was English-Irish-Scottish. In total, four generations of her ancestors were Shakespearean actors. Blanche was one of 5 daughters and one son born to the Rings. Several of Blanche's siblings were in the entertainment business and quickly became recognizable names in the industry. In fact, they often performed together or on the same playbill. Two of the Ring sisters, Grace and Sarah, were not performers. Blanche's sister Julie Ring (1878\u201319??) became a stage actress. She married Albert H. Sutherland, a theatrical agent and former British actor. They had a son, A. Edward Sutherland, who became a film director in the United States. Her sister Frances Ring (July 4, 1882 \u2013 January 15, 1951)Who Was Who in the Theatre: 1912-1976 Gale Research (compilation of John Parker's Who's Who in the Theatre series originally published annually) Frances Ring Meighan, findagrave.com Retrieved August 7, 2017 was married in 1909 to Thomas Meighan, the popular stage and later silent film actor.

Later she acted with Nat Goodwin and Chauncey Olcott. Her version of \"In the Good Old Summertime\" in 1902 was an instant hit. She followed this with another hit song \"The Belle of Avenue A\", performed in Tommy Rot, which was staged at Mrs. Osborn's Playhouse in New York City. Ring left the US for a tour of Europe including London, returning to America in 1904 where she became even more established as a favorite performer appearing at three notable venues belonging to vaudeville impresario F.F. Proctor including Proctor's Twenty-third Street Theater, Newark Theater and Fifth Avenue Theater. \"I've Got Rings On My Fingers\" was introduced when Blanche performed in The Midnight Sons in 1909. Her recording of the song for Victor Records is listed as one of Billboard's top hits of that year, along with her recordings of \"Yip-I-Addy-I-Aye\" and \"The Billiken Man.\" Will Rogers spoke his first lines on stage in Ring's play The Wall Street Girl. In 1910, she recorded \"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\" after introducing it in a Broadway show, and the song became one of her biggest hits. Among her other songs of note are \"Bedelia\" and \"I'd Leave My Happy Home for You\". The former was featured in The Jersey Lilly. During World War I, the singer was popular with \"They're All Out of Step But Jim\". Blanche Ring possessed a talent for mime. This helped her advance in musical revues and she was billed as \"America's Favorite Singing Comedienne\" as of 1918.
