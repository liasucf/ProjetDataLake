    "text": "The Indian women's national under-17 football team represents India in international women's under-17 football. The team is controlled by the governing body for football in India, the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The team and federation is currently a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the regional South Asian Football Federation (SAFF). The team have only participated once in the AFC U-17 Women's Championship, back during the tournament's inaugural edition. ==History== ===FIFA U17 Women's World Cup=== FIFA first organised the U17 Women's WC in the year 2008 and since organised it on every even years. From Asia the top three teams from AFC U-16 Women's Championship get qualified for the world cup, but India failed to qualify any of AFC championships since 2007 edition to 2017, thus failed to qualify for the first six editions of the World Cup. India was selected the host of 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and thus automatically got qualified for the tournament and will be its first participation in the World Cup. ===AFC U16 Women's Championship=== India women's U17 team first played their international match at the inaugural edition of AFC U-16 Women's Championship in 2005 where they first faced Thailand and got defeated by 6\u22124 on 16 April 2005. In the second match South Korea defeated them again by 7\u22120, but in the third match India registered their first win defeating Indonesia by 6\u22120 but they failed to proceed beyond the group stage. This was India's only AFC Women's U16 Championship campaign, as they failed to qualify any of the championships held since, which is being organised by AFC on every odd years. ===SAFF U-15 Women's Championship=== SAFF U15 Women's championship was first organised in 2017, where India became runners-up as defeated by Bangladesh by a solitary goal. In the next edition in 2018, the final was repeated again, but this time India beat Bangladesh by a solitary goal and become the SAFF champion. In the 2019 SAFF U-15 Women's Championship, India and Bangladesh reached the final for the third time. Both the teams fail to score any goal With in the regulation time. Thus penalty shoot-out became the match decider where Bangladesh failed to convert the first spot kick, which results in India becoming the champion by a 5\u22123 result in the shoot-out. ===BRICS U-17 Cup=== In 2018, at the second edition of BRICS U-17 Football Cup, which is a U-17 Football tournament played among teams of five BRICS countries, the U17 women's teams of the respective countries were invited to play in the tournament. India played round robin matches, first against South Africa, and suffered a loss by 5\u22121, then suffered another defeat against Russia by 3\u22121. In their next match Brazil defeated them by 5\u22120 and in their last match they lost 2\u22121 to China. ==Coaches== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name !
