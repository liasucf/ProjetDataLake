    "text": "Escape the Day is a Swedish electronicore band from Gothenburg, formed in 2007 as Mindscape, by Sebastian Westman and Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock. The band currently consists of Sebastian Westman (guitar, keyboards, drums, programming), Sebastian Ekstrand (clean vocals, keyboards, programming), Jonas Jenelin (screams) and Kristian Forsell (bass). == History == ===Mindscape (2007\u20132009)=== Escape the Day began their journey in 2007, as Mindscape. The line-up included Sebastian Ekstrand (vocals & synths), Sebastian Jarfelt (screams), Johan Weicht (bass), Niklas Jonsson (drums), Sebastian Westman and Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock (both guitars & synths), They released a self-titled EP in 2008, which received immediate recognition over the internet and included the songs \"Derailed\" and \"As We Were Once\". ===Escape the Day (2009\u20132011)=== After the departure of the screamer Sebastian Jarfelt, the band looked for a new screamer, but never found anyone suitable for their music. In the process of looking for a screamer, they recruited a vocalist, Maria Peters\u00e8n. They changed the name of the band to Escape the Day. Whilst no albums or extended plays were made by this 6-member line-up, they recorded and released 10+ songs via YouTube between 2009-2011 including \"Turn Back Time\". In 2011, they recruited Jonas Jenelin as screaming vocalist, allowing them to blend their current 90s-trance influenced metal sound with their earlier metalcore style of Mindscape. They released a teaser for a new song titled \"Rain\" that featured Jenelin. However, Escape the Day went on hiatus and eventually revealed that both Maria Peters\u00e8n and Niklas Jonsson had left the band. === Reunion (2012\u20132014) === Escape the Day returned in early-2012 as a 7-piece, with Angeline Stenbock on vocals and Neil Grant on drums. They remade two songs, \"Turn Back Time\" and \"As We Were Once\", which were both recorded for the video game Rock Band 3. In 2013, both Stenbock and Grant were replaced by Jennifer Jarnek and Nidas Richmount respectively. This line-up released the song \"The Way That I Am\". In 2014, Jarnek, Richmount and founding bassist Johan Weicht left the band. Weicht was replaced by Kristian Forsell. === Confessions and Into Inception (2014\u20132016) === Escape the Day released the EP titled Confessions in 2014, which included a remake of their first song \"Derailed\". They also released their first full length album Into Inception in 2016, which saw a continuation in the bands tradition of releasing an extended play or album every two years. However, before the release of their debut album, founding member Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock decided to leave the band. === \"Breaking the Tide\", Acoustic Sessions and new music (2017\u2013present) === On 31 December 2017, the band announced, through their Facebook page, that new music was on its way. On 26 February 2018, new single \"Breaking the Tide\" was released, their first single in three years. In August, an acoustic rendition of their latest single was released, which was followed with the release of the Acoustic Sessions EP, including the acoustic version of \"Breaking the Tide\" and \"Undone\". On 5 April 2019, the band released their new single \"An Ocean Between Us\". == Musical Style == Escape the Day's sound is similar to bands, such as Dead by April, and Amaranthe. Their sound is melodic metalcore, while blending rock and pop with electronic music. The band has described their sound as \"90's dance-trance scene blended with metal and a slight touch of rock and pop.\" ==Band members== === Current members === * Sebastian Westman \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming (2007\u2013present), drums (2014\u2013present) * Sebastian Ekstrand \u2013 clean vocals, keyboards, programming (2008\u2013present) * Jonas Jenelin \u2013 screams (2012\u2013present) * Kristian Forsell \u2013 bass guitar (2014\u2013present) === Past members === * Patrick M\u00f6hlenbrock \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming (2007\u20132016) * Niklas Jonsson \u2013 drums (2007\u20132011) * Sebastian Jarfelt \u2013 screams (2008\u20132009) * Johan Weicht \u2013 bass guitar (2008\u20132014) * Maria Petersen \u2013 clean vocals (2009\u20132011) * Neil Grant \u2013 drums (2012) * Angeline Stenbock \u2013 clean vocals (2012\u20132013) * Nidas Richmount \u2013 drums (2012\u20132013) * Jennifer Jarnek \u2013 clean vocals (2013) ===Timeline=== == Discography == === Albums === * 2016: Into Inception === Extended plays === * 2008: Mindscape (as Mindscape) * 2010: Escape the Day * 2014: Confessions * 2018: Acoustic Sessions === Singles === * 2010: \"Turn Back Time\" * 2013: \"The Way That I Am\" * 2014: \"A Beautiful Lie\" * 2015: \"Undone\" * 2015: \"Love Me Like U Do\" (Ellie Goulding Cover) * 2015: \"Breathe\" (feat.
