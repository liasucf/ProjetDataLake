The company is whole or partial owner of 50 local and regional newspaper with online newspapers and printing presses, and its own news agency, Avisenes Nyhetsbyr\u00e5. The corporation also owns and operates a group of printing plants under the brand name Prime Print in Russia. ==History== Amedia AS was established on 27 May 1948 as Norsk Arbeiderpresse (lit: Norwegian Labour Press). It was an association of social democratic newspapers. It was renamed A-pressen in 1994, a name which it retained until 2012. The company was originally created to finance Norwegian labour newspapers owned by the labour unions and Labour Party. In 1990 the company was refinanced and transferred to a corporation, with the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions and the Labour Party as the largest owners. When A-pressen bought part of TV2, the Labour Party chose to sell their stake in the company, and instead the M\u00f8llerGruppen, the Finnish company Sanoma and Telenor bought part of the company and it was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the end Sanoma sold their stake, the company was delisted and was then owned by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (45,2%), Telenor (44,8%) and the Fritt Ord Foundation (10,1%). The company sold its 50% stake in TV2 in January 2012. Amedia bought competitor Edda Media from Mecom Group in 2012. Amedia was bought by Sparebankstiftelsen DnB in 2016 and the company is now owned by Amediastiftelsen (The Amedia Foundation). ===CEOs=== *Johan Ona (1948\u20131974) *Einar Olsen (1974\u20131987) *Alf Hildrum (1987\u20132007) *Even Nordstr\u00f8m (2007\u20132010) *Thor Gjermund Eriksen (2010\u20132013) *Are Stokstad (2013\u2013present) ===Chairmen of the board=== *Konrad Nordahl (1948\u20131965) *Tor Aspengren (1965\u20131981) *Tor Halvorsen (1981?\u20131987) *Leif Haraldseth (1987\u20131990, acting from 1987 to 1988) *Svein-Erik Oxholm (1990\u20131997) *Jan Balstad (1997\u20132002) *Roar Fl\u00e5then (2002\u20132005) *Gerd-Liv Valla (2005\u20132007) *Erik Nord (2007\u20132010) *Jon Hippe (2010-2011) *Roar Fl\u00e5then (2011\u2013present) ==Newspapers== * Akershus Amtstidende * Arbeidets Rett * Aura Avis * Aust Agder Blad * Avisa Nordland * Bergensavisen * Bygdeposten * Demokraten * Eiker Bladet * Enebakk Avis * Finnmarken * Finnmark Dagblad * Finnmarksposten * Firda * Firdaposten * Fremover * Gl\u00e5mdalen * Hadeland * Halden Arbeiderblad * Halden Dagblad * Hamar Arbeiderblad * Hardanger Folkeblad * Helgeland Arbeiderblad * Indre Akershus Blad * Jarlsberg * Kvinnheringen * Lofotposten * Lofot-Tidende * Malvik Bladet * Min \u00c1igi * Moss Dagblad * Namdalsavisa * Nordlys * Opdalingen * Oppland Arbeiderblad * Porsgrunns Dagblad * Rakkestad Avis * Rana Blad * Ringerikes Blad * Rjukan Arbeiderblad * Rogalands Avis * Romerikes Blad * Sarpsborg Arbeiderblad * Smaalenenes Avis * Stj\u00f8rdalens Blad * Telemarksavisa * Tidens Krav * Tvedestrandsposten * \u00d8stlands-Posten * \u00d8yene ==References== Category:1948 establishments in Norway Category:Mass media companies established in 1948 Category:Mass media companies of Norway Category:Holding companies of Norway Category:Companies formerly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in Oslo Category:Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions Category:Telenor Category:Mass media in Oslo ",
