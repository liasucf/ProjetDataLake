    "text": "In demonology, Ose is a Great President of Hell, ruling three legions of demons (thirty to other authors, and Pseudomonarchia Daemonum gives no number of legions). He makes men wise in all liberal sciences and gives true answers concerning divine and secret things; he also brings insanity to any person the conjurer wishes, making them believe that they are the creature or thing the magician desired, or makes that person think he is a king and wearing a crown, or a Pope. Ose is depicted as a leopard that after a while changes into a man. His name seems to derive from Latin 'os', mouth, language, or 'osor', that who abhors. Other spellings: Os\u00e9, Oze, Oso, Voso. ==In popular culture== Ose appears in the Megami Tensei video game series, as a demon that can be summoned by the player. Ose is featured as the villain in the 2019 horror movie \u201dCountdown\u201d. ==See also== * The Lesser Key of Solomon ==Sources== *S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A. Crowley, The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King (1904). 1995 reprint: . Category:Goetic demons ",
