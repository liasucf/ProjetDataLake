Her kingdom stretched from M\u00e4t\u00e4ma in the west to the area south of the M\u00e4r\u00e4b river in the Ethiopian province of Tigray.. According to the Chronicle of King G\u00e4lawdewos, an account of the reign of the Ethiopian emperor G\u00e4lawdewos (1540\u201359), Ga'ewa was the queen of S\u00e4l\u00e4wa, a region in central Tigray. According to the Fut\u016b\u1e25 al-\u1e24abasha (Conquest of Abyssinia), an account of the campaigns of A\u1e25mad Gr\u0101\u00f1 (died 1543), she was the queen of M\u00e4z\u00e4ga, a region that has not been conclusively identified. It has been located north of the T\u00e4kk\u00e4ze river and bordering the Funj Sultanate in the west. After the death of her brother, M\u00e4k\u00e4ttar, sultan of M\u00e4z\u00e4ga, she took over the regency on behalf of her nephew Naf\u00ee. The Fut\u016b\u1e25 al-\u1e24abasha describes her as \"a woman of good counsel, intelligent and wise\". She reportedly launched several raids against the Christian Ethiopian Empire. In 1557, the Ottomans under \u00d6zdem\u00fcr Pasha took Massawa from the bahr negus Yeshaq and massacred the monks of Debre Damo. In a counteroffensive, Yeshaq defeated the Ottomans and invaded M\u00e4z\u00e4ga. Ga'ewa's troops were defeated and she fled to Debarwa and the protection of the Ottomans. She tried to persuade \u00d6zdem\u00fcr to liberate M\u00e4z\u00e4ga by telling him where she had hidden her treasure, but Yeshaq took Debarwa before the Ottomans could mount an expedition., p. 92. In folklore and oral traditions, Ga'ewa is often confused with the semi- legendary tenth-century queen Gudit. In some places, such as the village of Addi Akaweh, they are explicitly identified as one and the same person. Another tradition makes her the wife of A\u1e25mad Gr\u0101\u00f1. The oral traditions of the village of S\u01ddfra Ga\u2018\u01ddwa depict its namesake as a wealthy woman with several herds of cattle. ==Places named after her== *Addi Ga\u2018\u01ddwa (\"country of Ga'ewa\") *Q\u01dd\u1e63ri Ga\u2018\u01ddwa (\"enceinte of Ga'ewa\") *M\u01dd\u2018raf Ga\u2018\u01ddwa (\"resting place of Ga'ewa\") *M\u00e4qab\u01ddr Ga\u2018\u01ddwa (\"tomb of Ga'ewa\") *S\u01ddfra Ga\u2018\u01ddwa (\"place of Ga'ewa\") ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Category:African women in war Category:Women rulers in Africa Category:Islam in Ethiopia Category:Rulers of Ethiopia Category:16th-century monarchs in Africa Category:16th-century women rulers Category:Women in 16th-century warfare ",
