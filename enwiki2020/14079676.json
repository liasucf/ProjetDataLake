    "text": "Blue Cheer is the fourth album by American rock band Blue Cheer. It was recorded at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco and released in December 1969 by Philips Records. Gary Lee Yoder contributed songwriting for the opening and closing tracks and would later join the group as guitarist on their next album The Original Human Being. == Release and reception == According to Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia, the album was released in December 1969. Reviewing for The Village Voice the following June, Robert Christgau gave the album a \"B\" grade and wrote: \"There ought to be hundreds of groups like this one\u2014hard, competent, slightly commercial\u2014but there probably aren't more than 20. This is not especially original, but it's good, and I'll bet they're a stone happy gas live.\" AllMusic's Mark Deming later gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and appraised it in comparison to the band's harder previous records, calling it \"a fun album that generates an impressive groove ... a more laid-back and relaxed effort, but it still rocks with a strong and steady roll.\" == Track listing == ;Side one # \"Fool\" (Gary R.
