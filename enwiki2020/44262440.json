He created images of monuments of Bratislava and its surrounding, but was famous also as author of portraits (Franz Liszt, Graf G\u00e9za Zichy). He invented and patented a procedure to expose photographs on canvas, elephant bone, porcelain, wood, glass and email. In the 1850s he was the most prominent photographer in Bratislava. His portraits were the highlights of contemporary photography. He won many medals and awards from exhibitions (Paris 1867 and 1870, Hamburg 1868, Linz 1872). He died April 25, 1874 in Bratislava. In 1847, he first encountered daguerreotype. He received training from traveling photographer Johann Bubenik. Soon he also learnt calotype (talbotype) technique and collodion process from in Vienna between 1847\u201350. His first studio was set up in the garden pavilion of Slubek's house on Gaisgasse (today Kozia street 33) in the late 1840s (probably 1847). His second studio was at Promenade no. 34 from 1856 \u2013 1868 (now Hviezdoslavovo n\u00e1mestie). On 1 October 1868 he opened in a newly built house on Promenade 2 his third studio. The place next to the Hotel zum gr\u00fcnen Baum (today hotel Carlton) was later renamed to S\u00e9tat\u00e9r 9, then Kossuth Lajos Platz/Kossuth Lajost\u00e9r 9, and today is Hviezdoslavovo n\u00e1mestie 4. The studio was known for its lively social happenings. Among Kozi\u010d's close friends was allegedly Franz Liszt. Kozic made several of his portraits, and in return Liszt gave several concerts in Kozic's studio salon. Kozic was one of Pressburg's most prominent and esteemed citizens. Kozi\u010d was considered to be 'one of the most capable lightscribes of the entire crown possession.' After his death, the studio continued to be operated by his wife Karolina Kozics-Helle until 1926. They had three children: Karol\u00edna Eleon\u00f3ra Ema (born 3 October 1856), Pavlina Jozefina (born 27 June 1859) and Eduard Franti\u0161ek Xaver (born 2 January 1864). Artefacts from the studio are archived in museums in Bratislava and Ko\u0161ice. Kozics' photographs are part of the collections of Matica slovensk\u00e1, Slovak National Museum in Martin Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava. ==References== ==Sources== *Ede Kozics on Monoskop.org *Jakub Hloho\u0161, Eduard Nepomuk Kozi\u010d (in SLovak), 2012 Apr 25, 14:19 ==External links== *Kozics' photographs at WebUmenia.sk *Set of Kozics' photographs on Flickr Category:1829 births Category:1874 deaths Category:19th-century Slovak people Category:Slovak photographers ",
