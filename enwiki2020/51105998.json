In Masters-level swimming she is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of the sport and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2015. ==Early life== Pipes was born in 1962 in Lompoc, California, and learned to swim by taking classes at the local YMCA at the age of four. By the age of six, she had competed in her first race for the Lompoc Marlins. In 1970, Pipes moved to Chula Vista, CA a city south of San Diego. At 15 years old, she won the 400-yard medley at the National Junior Olympic Swimming Championships, coached by two-time Olympic Gold medalist Mike Troy competing for the Coronado Navy Swim Association. She graduated from Coronado High School in 1980. She was offered 15 full-ride scholarships to NCAA Division I schools and accepted one from the University of Arkansas.http://www.ishof.org/karlyn-pipes.html http://www.lavendermagazine.com/uncategorized/swimming-straight-for-inclusion/ ==Career== By the age of 19, her party lifestyle, \"poor work ethic\" and \"lack of discipline\" caused her to forfeit her scholarship at Arkansas after three semesters. Pipes describes the next chapter of her life as the \"lost years\" when her addictive tendencies took over and her life began to spiral out of control. For the next 11 years Pipes dropped out of college numerous times, worked as a seasonal beach lifeguard, was a waitress and held other odd jobs such as a bartender at Hotel del Coronado. On April 16, 1993, at the age of 31, Pipes entered a ten-day alcohol and drug rehabilitation program at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital. Immediately upon her release, Pipes returned to the water to help her recover, heal and regain lost strength. Three months later, she stepped up on the blocks to race again and began competing in U.S. Masters Swimming competitions. After six months of sobriety, Pipes established a new FINA world record in the 200-meter backstroke. By the end of her first year of Masters competition, she ranked first in the U.S. in seven events and added three more world records to her cache. In 1995, she set a total of 16 FINA Masters world records for the 30\u201334 age group, competing against many former Olympians. By the time she was 35, she was ranked first in the United States in every distance and stroke in 54 official events in the 35-39 age group and came within a few tenths of a second to qualify for the 1996 US Olympic Trials in the 200-meter backstroke. In 1995, she restarted her collegiate swimming career by competing for Palomar Junior College. Over the next two years she held a 4.0 GPA, broke every women's school record but one, set 4 National and 5 State Community College records and was twice named the Pacific Coast Conference Swimmer of the Year. In 1997, Pipes accepted a full athletic scholarship to attend Cal State Bakersfield, where she graduated cum laude with a BS in communications in 1999. While at Bakersfield, Pipes swam for coach Pat Skehan and helped the Lady Roadrunners to second place finish at the National Division II Championships. Pipes also became the oldest athlete, at age 36, to set an NCAA record, with a time 2:00.54 in the 200-yard backstroke, which remained the NCAA Division II record until 2001. In addition, she won three individual NCAA Division II titles in the 100-yard backstroke, 200 and 400-yard medley. Her time in 400-medley was eight seconds faster than the time she posted at age 15 to win the National Junior Olympics. Pipes was awarded Division II All-American honors in eight separate events over her collegiate career. After her college eligibility expired, at the age of 36, Karlyn became a professional athlete earning prize money at competitions swimming against women half her age. http://www.usms.org/articles/articledisplay.php?aid=1460 http://www.coronadonewsca.com/news/coronado_sports/karlyn-pipes-inducted-into- ishof-class-of/article_5326796a-5318-11e5-aef0-df7e02c995db.html http://coronadotimes.com/news/2015/12/20/victory-addiction-swimming-success- stories-coronado/ In 2002, Pipes set 25 FINA World records, 54 National records, achieved 6 lifetime best times and became the first woman over forty years old to complete the 500-yard freestyle event in less than five minutes with a time of 4:58.98.
