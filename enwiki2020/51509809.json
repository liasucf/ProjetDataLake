The crag made of quartz is a visible part of an about 6 km long corridor that continues across the valley of the Usa River until the Wormstein in the city forest of Usingen. From a geological standpoint it is a dip fault that was formed through the internal buckling of the mountains. The tough quartz could resist on several places the erosion and appears today on many places in the Taunus, however rarely so spectacular like here. In the west of the cliffs on the other side of the Kreisstra\u00dfe Usingen- Michelbach a bit hidden in the forest there is a \u201esister rock\u201c, the Saienstein. In the south there existed earlier an Open-Air stage, whose remains are still visible. Even today there is a \u201cKlippenkonzert\u201d performed every year that is very popular in the local area.
