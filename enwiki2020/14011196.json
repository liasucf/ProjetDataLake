    "text": "\"Haze\" is a song by American rock band Korn, written and recorded for the Ubisoft video game Haze. It was released as a digital single in the US on April 22, 2008. The game itself was released in May 2008 for the PlayStation 3. Korn posted a blog entry on April 23, 2008 stating that those who purchased their untitled album would be able to download \"Haze\" as a free VBR-quality MP3 by visiting a certain website. \"Haze\" was featured as a bonus track on the Enhanced Edition and the Australian re-release of the Untitled album. ==Live performance== The song had its live premiere during the encore of the first European Avoid The Noid Pizza Party concert in Dublin on January 13, 2008 to a positive reception from the audience. ==Music video== The video is a live performance of \"Haze\" spliced with gameplay footage. There is no word regarding whether or not the video will debut on television; so far it has only been released via YouTube, and the PSN store at HD 1080p as a free download. ===Mashup contest=== Ubisoft and Korn created a video mashup contest on April 28, 2008. The fans of Haze and the fans of Korn were given the opportunity to design the official video for \"Haze\". The winners were chosen on June 13, 2008, and the user \"bootsrfun\" on gametrailers.com was the first- place winner, which means his entry is now the official \"Haze\" video. There were also second place, third place, fourth place, and fifth-place winners. ==Track listing== # \"Haze\" - 2:49 ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Ubisoft's site for Haze Category:2008 singles Category:Korn songs Category:Song articles with missing songwriters Category:Video game theme songs ",
