It is endemic to the Philippines, where it is found on several islands at elevations of 350 to 1500 m above sea level. Its body is covered with pointed scales that likely deter predators. This species typically lives at the banks of streams and rivers and in forests, where they live under decayed logs. Near water they usually hide under rocks and warm up under the sun on those rocks when there is no danger around.Republic of the Philippines - Stamps & Postal History. philippinestamps.net == References == Category:Tropidophorus Category:Reptiles described in 1908 Category:Reptiles of the Philippines ",
