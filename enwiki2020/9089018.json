    "text": "Sharp's Brewery is a British brewery founded in 1994 in St Minver Lowlands, Rock, Cornwall, by Bill Sharp. Since 2011, the brewery has been owned by Molson Coors. It is best known for its flagship ale Doom Bar, named after the notoriously perilous Doom Bar sandbank in north Cornwall. ==History== The brewery has been through three phases \u2013 from a small micro brewery, to a larger facility within the same building and finally to the current phase that has seen the Brewery extend its premises to accommodate more vessels and increase its brewing capacity. Unlike many breweries, they do not own or operate any public houses, hotels or restaurants. Their focus is solely on brewing beer. Sharp's also run a joint venture with Paul Ainsworth \u2013 the Mariners \u2013 in Rock. On 2 February 2011 the brewery was bought by Molson Coors Brewing Company for \u00a320 million. ==Beers== Sharp's produce regular cask ales, seasonal ales, and pasteurised bottled beers. ===Doom Bar bitter=== Doom Bar pump logo Doom Bar on draught alongside other beers in a pub in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. Doom Bar bitter (4.0 abv), the brewery's flagship ale, accounts for nearly 90% of sales. Over of Doom Bar was produced in 2010. In 2011, sales increased by 22 per cent, making it the UK's fastest growing ale for three years in a row. The beer is named after the dangerous Doom Bar sandbank at the mouth of the Camel Estuary in north Cornwall. Cask Doom Bar is brewed at Rock, but bottled Doom Bar has been produced, away, in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, since 2013. This ale can now be found across the UK as well as in Italy, Sweden and Japan. Doom Bar bitter became the first official beer sponsor of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race between 2008 and 2012. Securing the \"Doom Bar brand\" was cited as the reason that Molson Coors spent \u00a320 million on their takeover of Sharp's Brewery in 2011; Doom Bar is now the largest cask ale brand in Molson Coors' portfolio. Doom Bar was awarded an International Beer Challenge World Top 50 Beer award in 2006, and a bronze award in 2011 and 2012. In 2010 it won a bronze in the Publican Licensees Choice Awards. It received a Taste of the West bronze award in 2013, along with a Brussels Beer Challenge (Pale and Amber Ale: Bitter) bronze and a PMA Publican's Choice award for national cask ale brand.
