Harrison was selected to play for one State of Origin match, playing for the Queensland Maroons in game 3, 2005, thus become South Sydney's first Queensland Origin representative in many years. Harrison's elevation to the Souths captaincy in 2005 proved to be a turning point in both the club's 2005 season and his career, as the team won six of their final eight matches under his captaincy to avoid the wooden spoon (the only losses in that period were against the eventual Grand Finalists, Wests Tigers and North Queensland). ===Sydney Roosters=== Harrison moved to South Sydney's arch rivals the Sydney Roosters for the 2006 NRL season.

Harrison was picked ahead of his club captain Scott Prince (who was only drafted into the squad after a knee injury sustained by Darren Lockyer) to play in the second State of Origin on 11 June 2008. In April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. In the 2009 NRL season, Harrison was part of the first Gold Coast team to reach the finals. Harrison played in both finals matches against the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta. The following year, Harrison was a member of the Gold Coast side which enjoyed their best season on the field as they eventually reached the preliminary final before being defeated by Harrison's old club the Sydney Roosters. In the 2011 NRL season, Harrison was limited to only 13 games as the Gold Coast finished last on the table and claimed the wooden spoon. Harrison was only selected for Game I of the 2013 State of Origin series in which Queensland extended their record for consecutive series victories to eight. On 27 June 2014, he confirmed his retirement earlier than he wanted due to a neck injury.http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/sport/nrl/news/2014/4/ashley-harrison- of-gold-coast-titans-announces-retirement/ ==Footnotes== == External links == *NRL profile Category:1981 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Gold Coast Titans players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs captains Category:Brisbane Broncos players Category:Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players Category:NRL All Stars players Category:Prime Minister's XIII players Category:Rugby league locks Category:Rugby league five-eighths Category:Sportsmen from Queensland Category:Living people Category:Rugby league players from Brisbane ",
