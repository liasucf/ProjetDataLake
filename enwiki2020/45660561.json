Born in Whitechapel, London, Hamlyn initially trained as a nurse at University College Hospital London. She studied pottery part-time at Putney Adult Education Centre, before attending Harrow School of Art (1972-1974) where she was taught by Michael Casson. In 1975 she set up Millfield Pottery Workshop near Doncaster Yorkshire. Hamlyn is credited with discovering the green colour that arises when painting a titanium wash over a blue slip and in 1999 she was awarded the European Saltglaze Prize. Along with Walter Keeler she is considered a pioneer of the salt glaze revival. Hamlyn is a Fellow and former chair of the Craft Potters Association. Her work is displayed at the Victoria & Albert Museum London, in the Crafts Council Permanent Collection, and the William Alfred Ismay ceramics collection at the York Art Gallery. ==References== == External links == * Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:English potters Category:Women potters Category:British ceramists Category:British women ceramists ",
