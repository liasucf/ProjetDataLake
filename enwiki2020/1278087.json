It was named for the Titans of Greek mythology. __TOC__ == First generation (A60; 2003) == Development of the Titan began in September 1999, with design work under Diane Allen.

The design language of the future truck was previewed by the 2001 Alpha T concept shown at the 2001 Detroit Auto Show, which had previously developed through November 2000. Production began on September 21, 2003 and sales on December 1, 2003. The Titan used Nissan's new full-size F-Alpha platform.
