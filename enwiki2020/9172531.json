    "text": "Aylett Hawes (April 21, 1768 - August 31, 1833) was a nineteenth-century doctor, planter, politician and planter from Virginia. ==Early life and education== Born in Culpeper County, Virginia, Hawes received a private classical education. He then studied medicine and finished his education in Edinburgh, Scotland. ==Career== Upon returning to Virginia, Hawes practiced medicine as well as bought several plantations in Culpeper County and what became Rappahannock County, Virginia, which he farmed using enslaved labor. He owned 25 slaves in Culpeper County in 1810.1810 U.S. Federal Census for Culpeper, Culpeper County, Virginia A decade later, Hawes owned 49 slaves.1820 U.S. Federal Census for Culpeper County, Virginia In the last census before his death, he owned 70 slaves.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Culpeper County, Virginia Culpeper County voters elected Hawes as one of their two representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates. He won re-election several times, serving from 1802 to 1806, all alongside John Roberts.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978), pp. 227, 231, 235, 239 In 1810, voters in what was then Virginia's 9th congressional district elected Hawes, who ran as a Democratic- Republican to the United States House of Representatives. However, the 1810 census necessitated redistricting, so in his re-election campaign, Hawes ran in Virginia's 10th congressional district, whose incumbent John Dawson was moved into Virginia's 11th congressional district, much as Hawes was moved from the 9th. Hawes won re-election twice before resigning to resume his medical practice and plantations in Culpeper and Rappahannock Counties. He was succeeded by fellow Democratic Republican George F. Strother, who had succeeded him in the Virginia House of Delegates about a decade earlier. ==Death and legacy== Hawes died on his farm in Rappahannock County, Virginia on August 31, 1833 and was interred on another plantation, in Sperryville, Virginia. He was the uncle of Richard Hawes, Albert Gallatin Hawes and Aylett Hawes Buckner. ==References== Category:1768 births Category:1833 deaths Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia Category:Farmers from Virginia Category:People from Culpeper County, Virginia Category:American planters Category:Virginia Democratic-Republicans Category:People from Rappahannock County, Virginia Category:Democratic-Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Hawes family Category:19th-century American politicians ",
