His first stand, on Boston Post Road, was in front of Skinner's Floral shop near the-then Central School (now Town of Mamaroneck offices). He sold cider and apples from an orchard he had purchased on Quaker Ridge. Later, Walter moved south on Post Road, in Shepard's Field (approximately where Richbell Road now meets Post Road). It was here that he began selling his unique brand of hot dogs, blended from beef, pork, and veal, with the wieners split-grilled. At Shepard's Field Walter constructed a cider press to make apple cider. There were blueprints for a stand to be built on an adjacent property on Post Road that would include a residence on the second floor. The property was, however, condemned by the School Board; a junior high school was built in 1926 (now a campus of Mamaroneck High). In 1928 he purchased the property at 937 Palmer Avenue, where his then-new pagoda has been since. The Palmer Avenue building has a pagoda-style copper roof, now oxidized to a light green, and dragon lanterns. It is an example of roadside architecture. See also: The current owner is Walter's son Eugene Warrington. ==Acclaim== The stand has been featured in the New York Times;\"Quick Bite/Mamaroneck: This Is No Street Corner Hot Dog\" The New York Times, September 3, 2006 and on CBS News Sunday Morning in 2003.CBS Television Network Releases: Listings for \"CBS News Sunday Morning' for July 6, 2003 In 2010 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
