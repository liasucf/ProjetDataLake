    "text": "In algebraic geometry, the cohomology of a stack is a generalization of \u00e9tale cohomology. In a sense, it is a theory that is coarser than the Chow group of a stack. The cohomology of a quotient stack (e.g., classifying stack) can be thought of as an algebraic counterpart of equivariant cohomology. For example, Borel's theorem states that the cohomology ring of a classifying stack is a polynomial ring. == See also == *l-adic sheaf *smooth topology == References == * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
