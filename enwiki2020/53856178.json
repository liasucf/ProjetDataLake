Once, while Deva Datta is asleep a heavenly angel Tilottama (Anjali Devi), entices and lifts him together with. Chandrakanth (Sadasiva Rao), one that wants to possess Tilottama aware of it. So, she backs Deva Datta by associating with another Tilottama (again Anjali Devi) daughter of King Suurasena (Sundara Rao). Also accords him a ring with which he can meet her. Tilottama on earth also loves and marries Deva Datta without her parent's knowledge and she conceives. One night when Deva Dattudu thinks of the heavenly Tilottama, he puts the ring on and reaches her. Chandrakanth observes them, in anger curses them to live as hunters on earth and be also oblivious to their past. On one side, Haridas and Vasantha Sena are in search of Deva Datta and on another side, Tilottama on earth feels sorrow that knows no bounds. So, her father prepares the picture of Deva Datta and announces rewards to those who would be able to get him. Ganapathi (M. Kondaiah), the Deva Datta's friend, sees the picture and writes a letter to Vasantha Sena to come to Tilottama's kingdom. As a musician, Vasantha Sena gains admission to the court. Vijaya Simha (A. V. Subba Rao), chief commander of the kingdom is attracted to Vasantha Sena, but she rejects him; in anger, he orders his men to kidnap her. But by mistake, they kidnap princess Tilottama and leave her in the forest, where she gives birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, Haridas gives her shelter. As hunters, Deva Datta and heavenly Tilottama are getting on happily. Vasantha Sena is suspected for the missing of princess Tilottama. She was given a death sentence. The soldiers take her to the forest, where Deva Datta protects her, but due to the curse, he is not able to recognize her, so he pushes her and runs away. Meanwhile, heavenly Tilottama is banned from taking part in religious function because she is childless. In distress, she consults a sorceress who suggests her to offer a child to Goddess Kaali for children. Tilottama prevails on her husband to get a baby. Deva Datta kidnaps none other than princess Tilottama's child. Seeing this, she also runs behind him, Vasantha Sena and Haridas also follow them. All of them reach the temple, they try to stop from killing the baby but is goaded to it by Deva Datta.
