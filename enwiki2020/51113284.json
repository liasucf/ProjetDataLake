    "text": "Clara Seger is a character from the CBS television show Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders. Portrayed by Alana de la Garza, the character did not appear in the series' backdoor pilot (Criminal Minds \"Beyond Borders\"), but instead replaced Anna Gunn's \"law expert and linguist Lily Lambert\" in the first episode (March 16, 2016). When de la Garza spoke to Yahoo! in March 2016, she raved about the ease and comfortableness of the character's wardrobe: flat-heeled shoes, cargo pants, and loose-fitting t-shirts. Seger is a cultural anthropologist, returning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's International Response Team in the first season after taking a two-year sabbatical following the death of her co-worker and husband. She speaks 13 languages fluently, including French and Thai, a feat that complicated de la Garza's performances: \"That was tricky for me, to kind of swallow it and make it sound authentic. [\u2026] In Thai, there was a line I had to say that I kept saying like a question but it was actually a statement. I was like, 'This feels awkward.' It's like retraining your brain.\" ==References== Category:Criminal Minds characters Category:Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders Category:fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:television characters introduced in 2016 ",
