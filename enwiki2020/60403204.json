He was the son of Jewish merchants. He spent his twenties working backstage and in smaller roles, before achieving his breakthrough in 1902 in Franz Leh\u00e1r's ' opposite Mizzi G\u00fcnther. Treumann with Mizzi Gunther in The Merry Widow, 1906 In 1905 he created the role of Count Danilo Danilovitsch in Leh\u00e1r's Die lustige Witwe (The Merry Widow). During the second half of the 1920s he appeared in several films, such as Der Rastelbinder (1927), Flucht in die Fremdenlegion (1929), Spiel um den Mann (1929), Trust der Diebe (1929), Katharina Knie (1929) and Die Warschauer Zitadelle (1930). During the 1930s, as a Jew, his opportunities to perform suffered, and his final appearance was in 1935. In 1942 he was arrested and taken to a transit camp. His colleague, the actor Theo Lingen was able to get him released, but soon afterwards he was arrested again. He was repeatedly scheduled for transport to a concentration camp, each time saved by influential friends such as Franz Leh\u00e1r. However on 28 July 1942, aged 70 years old, Treumann was finally deported to Theresienstadt together with his wife Stefanie. She died just two months later, and her death plunged Treumann into a deep depression. A few months later, on 5 March 1943, still in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, he too died. In 1955, Treumanngasse in Vienna's Hietzing district was named after him. == Recordings == * Franz Leh\u00e1r, \"O Vaterland, du machst bei Tag\" from The Merry Widow.
