    "text": "Adri\u00e1n Marcelo Sporle (born 13 July 1995) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Dundee United. He previously played for Banfield in Argentina. ==Background== Sporle holds dual nationality through his German grandfather. ==Career== Sporle, after joining their ranks in 2008, began his senior career with Banfield in 2014, making his debut on 7 June in the club's final match of their 2013\u201314 Primera B Nacional-winning campaign against Uni\u00f3n Santa Fe. He made his continental debut in August 2016 against San Lorenzo in the Copa Sudamericana, prior to scoring his first goal on 19 November in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n versus Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed. On 13 June 2019, after one goal in sixty-nine games, Sporle left for Scottish football after agreeing a move to Championship side Dundee United; penning a three-year contract. His unofficial bow came in a Brechin City friendly on 5 July. Sporle made his competitive debut for Dundee United on 12 July, playing forty-five minutes of a Scottish League Cup group stage loss to Heart of Midlothian. On his second appearance in the same competition, Sporle netted his opening goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Cowdenbeath on 19 July. He didn't feature in any of the club's first four Championship fixtures, instead he played for the reserves in the SPFL Reserve League. Sporle's first league appearance belatedly arrived on 21 September, as he came off the bench to replace Louis App\u00e9r\u00e9 in a 2\u20131 home win over Arbroath. Sporle struggled to learn English in his early months. On 11 January 2020, Sporle scored his first league goal during a win away to Partick Thistle. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Banfield |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2014 |rowspan=\"6\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2015 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2016 |6||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||7||0 |- |2016\u201317 |18||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2Appearance(s) in the Copa Sudamericana||0||0||0||22||1 |- |2017\u201318 |20||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||26||0 |- |2018\u201319 |10||0||1||0||0||0||2||0||0||0||13||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !55!!1!!6!!0!!0!!0!!8!!0!!0!!0!!69!!1 |- |rowspan=3|Dundee United |2019\u201320 |Championship |11||1||1||1||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||16||3 |- |2020\u201321 |Scottish Premiership |8||1||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||8||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !19!!2!!1!!1!!3!!1!!0!!0!!1!!0!!24!!4 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !74!!3!!7!!1!!3!!1!!8!!0!!1!!0!!93!!5 |} ==Honours== ;Banfield *Primera B Nacional: 2013\u201314 ;Dundee United *Championship: 2019\u201320 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from Neuqu\u00e9n Category:Argentine people of German descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Scotland Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Banfield footballers Category:Dundee United F.C. players ",
