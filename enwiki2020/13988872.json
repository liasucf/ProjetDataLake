    "text": "Wouterus Leonardus Lutkie (February 23, 1887 in 's-Hertogenbosch \u2013 January 23, 1968 in Nuland) was a Dutch Catholic priest and fascist. ==Biography== Lutkie came from a wealthy business family and initially was influenced by the idealism of Ernest Hello and L\u00e9on Bloy. However he soon became more interested in nationalism and combining it with his fervent Catholicism.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890 He was ordained in 1919 but never completed his studies and, following a clash with his bishop over articles he published in the rightist journal Vreugde, he was set up in Nuland where he spent the rest of his life. Initially a supporter of Charles Maurras, Lutkie became drawn to Benito Mussolini and travelled to Italy in 1924, which increased his zeal. Writing for a number of fascist journals, he also set up his own Aristo in 1930. This lasted until 1943 before reappearing after the war and continuing until 1965. He also translated Mussolini's works into the Dutch language and conducted and published a series of interviews with the Italian leader. He would also co-operate with Arnold Meijer and the Black Front. In all however Lutkie sought to weld traditional Christianity to fascism's youthful dynamism and he built up a small but fanatical group of followers with the publication of Aristo.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 453-4 Lutkie had little time for Anton Mussert and did not support Nazism and as such his collaboration during World War II was minimal. As such he faced no charges after the war, despite an examination, and spent the post-war years in semi-retirement (albeit still publishing Aristo until 1965). ==See also== ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from 's-Hertogenbosch Category:Dutch fascists Category:Dutch Roman Catholics Category:Dutch Roman Catholic priests Category:Catholicism and far-right politics Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests ",
