In a waste pit in front of the small cave artifacts up to 10,500 years old have been found, which are considered to be the oldest evidence of ritual acts in Canada. The cave is located a few kilometers north of Fort St. John, near Charlie Lake. No artifacts were found in the cave itself, which measures is , but in a kind of waste pit in front of the cave entrance, they go back up to 11,000 years, including a fluted point, six retouched flakes and a small bone bead. These findings provide evidence of the northward migration of hunters and bison, in addition, found two buried ravens, which are the oldest traces of rituals in Canada.
