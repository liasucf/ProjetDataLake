He is also a Melbourne Marathon Spartan Legend which means he has completed every Melbourne Marathon since the event began in 1978 (along with six other runners: See: http://melbournemarathonspartans.com/legends/ ). In 2017 the Melbourne Marathon had its 40th Edition when 6 Legends completed their 40th Melbourne Marathon and all six followed up in 2018 with their 41st Melbourne Marathon. No other race in the world has had a 41 year streak from Event 1, and Melbourne has 6 runners who have run and finished all editions of their race.

Bruce's running achievements are very modest when compared to the elite runners of this world, but his commitment and dedication is rarely equaled. He regularly signs up to lead 'Pacing groups' in various Marathons, therefore bypassing a chance to get the best out of himself; rather he regular focuses his effort into helping others do their best. Bruce has led pacing groups in five different countries (Australia, India (Mumbai: 2012/2014), New Zealand (Rotorua 2014, Auckland 2015), USA (New York 2014) and Germany (Berlin 2017).

He has run a sub 3 hour marathon nine times. Bruce is also the Race Director/Race Co-ordinator of the following races: Maidenwell Marathon Weekend The \"Time Honoured\" Lamington Classic, Australia's oldest trail run which was established in 1970. The Australia Day Weekend 'Tamborine Mountain Relay and Marathon. He is also a 'course director/advisor' for various races in South-East Queensland. Over the years Bruce has written many articles on his running experiences, or has had articles written about him. In his travels, Bruce leaves more behind than footprints, at the moment his philanthropy extends South Africa through the Ethembeni School(https://www.ethembenischool.co.za/), besides being generous with certain worthy causes within Australia. Away from running, Bruce runs his own Geotechnical Business with bases in both Brisbane and Sydney (and has so for over 35 years), so he understands what it takes to survive both in his running shoes and the world of business. Bruce is also a corporate speaker who has over 50 years of running and motivational stories to tell. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Australian male long-distance runners Category:Australian male marathon runners Category:1953 births ",
