He was the head football coach at Ohio Northern University in 1905, 1910 and 1918.

He remained active in athletics and was chosen as captain of both the football and baseball teams. He graduated from Ohio Northern in 1904 with a degree in civil engineering. In October 1903, Smull played in a football game against Michigan. Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost was impressed by Smull and recruited him. In the fall of 1904, Smull transferred to Michigan. He appeared in five games for Yost's 1904 \"Point-a-Minute\" football team that compiled a 10\u20130 record and outscored opponents, 567 to 22. Smull left Michigan before the end of the 1904 season, transferring to Lafayette College. According to one account, he was found it impossible to arrange a schedule at Michigan that also allowed him to pursue his studies. ==Professor and coach== Smull returned to Ohio Northern in 1905 as the head of the engineering department and faculty manager of athletics.

As a tribute to Smull's contributions, Ohio Northern's engineering college is known as the T.J. Smull College of Engineering. In 1968, Smull was selected as one of the six inaugural inductees into the Ohio Northern Athletics Hall of Fame. ==Head coaching record== ===Football=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1875 births Category:1962 deaths Category:American civil engineers Category:American football tackles Category:Lock Haven Bald Eagles baseball players Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Ohio Northern Polar Bears baseball coaches Category:Ohio Northern Polar Bears baseball players Category:Ohio Northern Polar Bears football coaches Category:Ohio Northern Polar Bears football players Category:Ohio Northern University faculty Category:Susquehanna River Hawks baseball players Category:People from Clinton County, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania ",
