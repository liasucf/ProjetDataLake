    "text": "Wings Over the Pacific is a 60-minute 1943 drama film, directed by Phil Rosen and starring Inez Cooper, Edward Norris and Montagu Love. Produced by Monogram Pictures, the film depicts an island community in the South Pacific caught up in World War II. ==Plot== In 1943, World War I veteran Jim Butler (Montagu Love), along with his daughter Nona (Inez Cooper) and their English servant and friend, Harry Adams (Ernie Adams), live on Sunday Island, a small island in the South Pacific. Their idyllic life is shattered when an air battle takes place over the island. One pilot bails out of his damaged aircraft while the other pilot manages to land. A German pilot, Lt. Kurt Heiman (Henry Guttman) finds that the American pilot Allan Scott (Edward Norris) is unconscious, but before he is killed, Mona entreats Helman to bring the wounded American to her home. Butler is afraid that either pilot will contact their superiors about the valuable oil deposits on the island, so he takes control of the situation, confiscating the German's pistol and insisting that both antagonists agree to a truce. Helman has a secret ally on the island, Captain Van Bronck (Robert Armstrong) and together, the two make plans to have Japanese invaders to take over the island. An uneasy alliance of Butler and the American pilot is needed to beat back the attack, but ultimately, the islanders and their friends are able to summon help from the Americans. Mona and Scott declare their love and prepare for a life together. ==Cast== * Inez Cooper as Nona Butler * Edward Norris as Lt.

Monogram Pictures operated the Monogram Ranch, its movie ranch in Placerita Canyon near Newhall, California, in the northern San Gabriel Mountains foothills.\"Placeritos Ranch \u2013 Monogram Ranch \u2013 Melody Ranch.\" Melody Ranch History (employees.oxy.edu). Retrieved: August 1, 2016. The aircraft in Wings Over the Pacific included the use of a Curtiss P-40 as a United States Navy (USN) fighter, although it was a replica and the only flying scenes used miniatures.Santoir, Christian. \"Review: 'Wings Over the Pacific'.\" Aeromovies. Retrieved: August 1, 2016. The Capelis XC-12, a failed 1933 airliner design that most notably was used as a prop, was featured in Wings Over the Pacific as a Japanese transport. The aircraft was bought by RKO in March 1939 and was used in a number of films during World War II, when flyable aircraft were unavailable. Previously, the XC-12 had appeared in Five Came Back (1939) with Chester Morris and Lucille Ball, The Flying Tigers (1942), starring John Wayne,Hughes 2012, p. 44. and Immortal Sergeant (1943) with Henry Fonda, Thomas Mitchell and Maureen O'Hara. ==Reception== Wings Over the Pacific had a New York premiere, opening on the week of June 15, 1943. The film was seen as a primarily a B film programmer, typical of many of the propaganda films of the era.Koppes and Black 1987, p. 16. Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, however, characterized the film as \"... (a) poor Monogram production\".Pendo 1985, p. 207. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Farmer, James H. Celluloid Wings: The Impact of Movies on Aviation.
