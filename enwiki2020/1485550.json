    "text": "Jaroslav Kurzweil (born 1926) () is a Czech mathematician. He is a specialist in ordinary differential equations and defined the Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral in terms of Riemann sums, first published in 1957 in the Czechoslovak Mathematical Journal. Kurzweil has been awarded the highest possible scientific prize of the Czech Republic, the \"Czech Brain\" of the year 2006, as an acknowledgement of his life achievements.Mathematician Jaroslav Kurzweil to be awarded \"Czech Brain\" prize, Czech Radio, May 10, 2006.

Accessed January 23, 2010 With limited opportunities of contact between mathematicians within the Iron Curtain and those from the West, Kurzweil and Ivo Babuska founded a series of international scientific conferences named EQUADIFF, being held every four years since 1962 alternately in Praha, Bratislava, and Brno. He was chief editor of Mathematica Bohemica (then called Casopis pro pestovani matematiky) from 1956 to 1970 and was in its editorial board until 2007. In 2007, Kurzweil delivered a New Year's toast on Czech Television.Ninety years of Jaroslav Kurzweil == See also == * Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral ==References== *Kurzweil, Jaroslav (2012).
