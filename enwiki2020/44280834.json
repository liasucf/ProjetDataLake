    "text": "The Berkeley Global Campus at Richmond Bay, formerly the Richmond Bay campus and the Richmond Field Station, is a campus of the University of California, Berkeley, located in Richmond, California. The name was changed in October 2014, reflecting plans to expand the campus' scope, beyond the original plan to make it an extension of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Work on the extension had been halted due to federal budget cuts in 2013. ==History== UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks announced the proposed development on 29 October 2014. In August 2016, just prior to his resignation as chancellor, Dirks announced that the university would be suspending plans for the project. The name has been suspended as well and has returned to Richmond Field Station. ==References== ==External links== *LBL website Category:University of California, Berkeley Category:2014 in California Category:Education in Richmond, California ",
