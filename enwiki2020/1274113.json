    "text": "Memorial to Viscount Harry Crookshank, Lincoln Cathedral Harry Frederick Comfort Crookshank, 1st Viscount Crookshank, (27 May 1893 \u2013 17 October 1961), was a British Conservative politician. He was Minister of Health between 1951 and 1952 and Leader of the House of Commons between 1951 and 1955. ==Background and education== Crookshank was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Harry Maule Crookshank and Emma, daughter of Major Samuel Comfort, of New York City. On his father's side, he descended from Alexander Crookshank, of County Longford, Ireland, who represented Belfast in the Irish House of Commons and served as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford. In the First World War, he joined the Hampshire Regiment and served as a captain in the Grenadier Guards. On one occasion he was buried alive by an explosion for twenty minutes, and on another in 1916 he was castrated by shrapnel, requiring him to wear a surgical truss for the rest of his life.Ball 2004, p. 41, 60 He was awarded by Serbia the Order of the White Eagle and Gold Medal for Valour.Article by Viscount Chandos. He joined the Diplomatic Service in 1919 and worked at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., until 1924. ==Political career== Crookshank was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough in 1924, a seat he held for the next 32 years. He entered the government as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1934 under Ramsay MacDonald. When Stanley Baldwin became prime minister in 1935 Crookshank was appointed Secretary for Mines, a post he retained when Neville Chamberlain became prime minister in 1937 until February 1939. In the latter year, he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He continued in this post also when Winston Churchill came to power in 1940,leighrayment.com Peerage: Cowper to Cutts of Gowran and was then Postmaster General under Churchill between 1943 and 1945. In 1942 he was offered the post of British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean at Algiers following the liberation of Algeria by Operation Torch but he declined, Harold Macmillan being appointed instead. When the Conservatives returned to office under Churchill in 1951, Crookshank was appointed Minister of Health and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. In 1952 exchanged his post at the Ministry of Health for the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal, while he remained as Commons Leader. He continued in these two positions until December 1955, the last year under the premiership of Sir Anthony Eden. In the 1955 New Year Honours he was made a Companion of Honour.leighrayment.com Companions of Honour He retired from the House of Commons in 1956 and was raised to the peerage as the Viscount Crookshank, of Gainsborough in the County of Lincoln, in January of that year. He had been offered a peerage in February 1940 but declined, having considered it at the time an insult because his First World War wounds had left him incapable of fathering any heir to a title.Article by S.J. Ball. Papers released by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with Harold Macmillan, led a faction within the Cabinet of Sir Winston Churchill's government, who opposed what they perceived to be an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into a premature decision to authorise a British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954. ==Personal life== Lord Crookshank was a Scottish Rite Freemason and Grand Master of Lincolnshire.Walton Hannah, Christian by Degrees (London: Britons Publishing Company, 1954), 211. Incapable as result of his First World War wounds of fathering children, Crookshank was a lifelong bachelor. He was also (not publicly) known as a homosexual and caused a near scandal when a male lover of his was adopted as Conservative candidate for the Grimsby constituency in 1958 but later withdrawn.The Conservative candidate for Grimsby at the 1959 and 1964 elections, Wilfred Pearson, was not the same man. His home from 1937 was at 51 Pont Street, Kensington, London, where in 1947 he hosted a meeting of like- minded backbench MPs who unsuccessfully demanded Churchill's removal as Conservative Party leader. He died of cancer at Chelsea, London, in October 1961, aged 68. The viscountcy died with him. Having been since 1960 High Steward of the City of Westminster, his funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey, followed by burial at Lincoln Cathedral. His sister, Helen Elizabeth Comfort Crookshank (1895\u20131948), lies next to him. == References == == Books cited == * (a joint biography of Harold Macmillan, Lord Salisbury, Oliver Lyttelton and Crookshank) == External links == * Category:1893 births Category:1961 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Castrated people Crookshank, Harry Category:Freemasons Category:Grenadier Guards officers Category:Leaders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Chamberlain peacetime government, 1937\u20131939 Category:Ministers in the Chamberlain wartime government, 1939\u20131940 Category:Ministers in the Churchill caretaker government, 1945 Category:Ministers in the Churchill wartime government, 1940\u20131945 Category:Ministers in the Eden government, 1955\u20131957 Category:Ministers in the third Churchill government, 1951\u20131955 Category:Peers created by Elizabeth II Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People educated at Summer Fields School Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Crookshank, Harry Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:United Kingdom Postmasters General Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of the United Kingdom ",
