    "text": "Edmund Goodman (born 8 October 1873 in Birmingham UK \u2014 died 1960) was an English football manager. He had his playing career cut short by an injury, sustained playing for Aston Villa reserves, which meant he had to have his leg amputated. After this he became assistant secretary to Aston Villa. When Crystal Palace F.C. was founded Aston Villa was asked for help in setting up the club; Villa offered Goodman to Palace and he helped to appoint the first manager and found the first Chairman. After two seasons he became manager and remained so for 18 years, becoming Crystal Palace's longest serving manager in the process. Goodman could be said to be the founding father of Crystal Palace F.C. Under Goodman's management Palace was the runner up in the Southern League in 1914, behind Swindon Town, on goal-average, and won the inaugural Third Division title in 1920\u201321. Palace was relegated in 1925 and in October that year Goodman resigned and reverted to his original position of club secretary. He retired in 1933 and subsequently ran a grocery shop in nearby Anerley, South London. ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. managers Category:English amputees Category:English football managers Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:English footballers ",
