    "text": "Witnica () is a town in western Poland, situated in the Lubusz Voivodeship, with 6,747 inhabitants (2019). The town is located in the historic Lubusz Land. The town's name derives from the Polish words wi\u0107 or witka, meaning a willow twig or a type of willow. ==History== Along with Lubusz Land it was part of medieval Poland, and later it was also under the rule of Brandenburg, the Czech Crown, Prussia, and between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany, located in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. The Germans brought Polish prisoners of war for forced labour to the town during World War II. In the final stages of World War II, half of the population fled before the Red Army captured the town in February 1945. Polish POWs were liberated. After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II the area became again part of Poland. The remaining population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. New Polish citizens, mostly themselves expell\u00e9es from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, came to the town. War damage was not significant, reaching 8% of the buildings. The ruins were dismantled to obtain bricks for the reconstruction of Warsaw destroyed by the Germans. ==Economy== The town is known for its brewery (Browar Witnica), established in 1848. ==Culture== A Polish military museum (Muzeum Chwa\u0142y Or\u0119\u017ca Polskiego) is located in Witnica. ==Sports== Witnica is home to football club , which competes in the Polish lower leagues. ==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities== See twin towns of Gmina Witnica. == People == * Johannes Sch\u00fcler (1894\u20131966), German conductor ==Gallery== Witnica 98F-05.jpg|Our Lady of Perpetual Help church Urzad Miasta i Gminy Witnica seat with flags 2008-05.jpg|Town hall Witnica, \u017b\u00f3\u0142ty Pa\u0142acyk.jpg|Yellow Palace (\u017b\u00f3\u0142ty Pa\u0142acyk) Witnica brewery (2).JPG|A old townhouse and the Witnica Brewery (Browar Witnica) ==References== ==External links== *Official town webpage *Jewish Community in Witnica on Virtual Shtetl Category:Cities and towns in Lubusz Voivodeship Category:Gorz\u00f3w County ",
