Being unhappy, he wanted to encourage all the Bengalis to perform national duties. == Transliteration in English == Punye pape dukkhe sukhe patane uthhane Manus haite dao tomar santane He snehartha bangabhumi\u2013taba grihakrore Chirasishu k'are ar rakhiyo na dhare. Deshdeshantar-majhe jar jetha sthan Khunjiya laite dao kariya sandhan. Pade pade choto choto nishedher dore Bendhe bendhe rakhiyo na bhalo chele k'are. Praan diye, dukkho s'ahe, aponar hate Sangram karite dao bhalomanda- sathe. Shirna shanta sadhu taba putrader d'hare Dao sabe grihachara lakkhichara k'are. Saat koti santanere, hey mugdha janoni, Rekhechho bangali kare\u2013manus karo ni. == Present Day Context == Tagore\u2019s \"Bangamata\" poem becomes important once again today as the Bengalis are neglecting their mother tongue (Bengali) and culture. == References == == External links == * rabindra-rachanabali.nltr.org *Bangamata poem (in Bengali) Category:Poems by Rabindranath Tagore Category:Bengali poems Category:Rabindranath_Tagore Category:Works_by_Rabindranath_Tagore Category:Poems ",
