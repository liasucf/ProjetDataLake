    "text": "Notre-Dame-de-Lorette () is a station on Line 12 of the Paris M\u00e9tro in the 9th arrondissement. The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud company's line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. It was the northern terminus of the line until its extension to Pigalle on 8 April 1911. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the M\u00e9tro. The station is named after the nearby church Notre-Dame-de- Lorette. The name of the church refers to the Italian city of Loreto and its Chiesa della Casa Santa (Church of the Holy House), a centre of Marianism. The station is located within a short walking distance from Le Peletier station on line 7, but no free transfer is permitted. ==Incidents== On 30 August 2000 at 13:21, the head car of an MF 67 overturned in the tunnel on its southbound approach from Saint-Georges.
