He is now a sports historian. ==Life and career== Wilf Haskell was born in Karachi, where his father was a missionary and schoolteacher. In the 1940s the family moved to Nelson, where Wilf attended Nelson College. An accurate medium-fast bowler, Haskell made his first-class cricket debut for Wellington in 1955-56, but did not establish himself in the team until 1967-68. In the first match of the 1967-68 season, against Otago, he took 6 for 6 off 16 overs to dismiss Otago for 85 in the second innings and give Wellington victory by 149 runs. He became a schoolteacher, teaching at a number of schools in New Zealand, and finally, from 1980 to 1998, at Wellington College. Since he retired from teaching he has written sports history. ==Books== *Seasons of Honour: A Centenary History of New Zealand Hockey 1902\u20132002 (2002) (with Geoff Watson) *Faster Stronger Higher: Golden Olympians of New Zealand: Volume I: 1912\u20131968 (2011) ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Indian emigrants to New Zealand Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Wellington cricketers Category:New Zealand male field hockey players Category:Cricketers from Karachi Category:New Zealand sports historians Category:New Zealand schoolteachers Category:People educated at Nelson College ",
