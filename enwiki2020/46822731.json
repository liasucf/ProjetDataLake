Her most recent book, Understanding dyslexia and other learning disabilities, was published by Pacific Educational Press in 2013. ==Research== Siegel's earliest research was on human information processing which in the 1980s became increasingly focused on developmental disabilities, especially reading disability. Many of her most well-known papers are on the relationship between IQ and reading disability classification. Her research on that relationship has at times proved controversial. In her 2012 paper \"Confessions and Reflections of the Black Sheep of the Learning Disabilities Field\", Siegel presented evidence from her long-term research to support her contention \"that the IQ score is unnecessary in the diagnosis of whether or not there is a learning disability\". She also criticized as \"very regressive\", trends to demand testing for \"'processing deficits', even though there is no evidence that processing deficits are useful for either diagnosis or remediation\" of learning disabilities.Siegel, Linda (2012). \"Confessions and Reflections of the Black Sheep of the Learning Disabilities Field\". Australian Journal of Learning Difficulties, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 63-77. Retrieved 31 May 2015. Siegel has been one of several academics who have criticized studies supportive of \"brain training\" programs and especially the Arrowsmith program founded by Barbara Arrowsmith Young in 1978. Siegel appeared in Fixing My Brain, a 2008 CBC documentary, about the Arrowsmith program, although a portion of her highly critical commentary was removed prior to broadcast after Arrowsmith Young's lawyers threatened the CBC with a lawsuit.Hill, M. F. (29 December 2008). \"Education expert calling her lawyer\" . Vancouver Sun. Retrieved 31 May 2015.
