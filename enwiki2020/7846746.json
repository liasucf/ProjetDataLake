R\u00f6da b\u00f6nor was one of the progg movement's first real girl bands. The lyrics and music were written mainly by the band members. Their most famous song is Oh, Carol. Others include Diskoteksjakt (\"Disco-hunt\"), S\u00e5ngen om sexualmyterna (\"The song of the sexual myths\"), Det ska bli slut p\u00e5 rumban (\"It's the end of the rumba\") and Nu har vi tr\u00f6ttnat (\"We have now become tired\"). They are also known for exactly copying the Italian Socialist song La lega. Members of the band included Charlotte Adlercreutz-Carlsson, Mona Eklund, Marianne Giselsson, Annbritt Kronlund, Kjerstin Nor\u00e9n, Gunilla Szemenk\u00e1r, Eva Vahlne, Eva Westerberg and Kaya \u00c5lander.
