However, in November 1913, the Mahsud mulla died, and his son, Fazl-Din, disregarded the peace agreement and renewed raids, with encouragement from pro-Turkish and anti-British elements in the Afghan government. Hostilities between the British and the Mahsud began with the \"Tank outrage\" of April 1914. In this incident, the Mahsud killed Major Dodd, the Political Agent for South Waziristan, in addition to 2 officers and 3 sepoys. Pro-Turkish and Anti-British elements in Kabul would encourage hostilities. From April 1914 to March 1915, the Mahsuds committed 81 raids classed as serious, which do not include numerous cases of cattle lifting, burglary, wire cutting and small offences. In 1916, Viceroy Frederic Thesiger was informed that: In March 1917, the Mahsud began raiding into the British Raj. Mahsud attacks throughout the first half of 1917 on pickets, garrisons and convoys belonging to the British prompted a punitive expedition in June. Having been incurred heavy losses in that year by the Mahsud, the British intended to restore their prestige. == Conflict == British forces commanded by Major-General Benyon advanced into Mahsud tribal territory on the 6th. British forces engaged the Mahsud on the 7th, 12th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, and 24 June. On the 25th, hostilities ceased as the Mahsud began asking for peace. Part of the terms were that the Mahsuds had to hand rifles they had stolen - some of these came into the hands of British troops while they were still there. British troops began withdrawing on 12 July. The final peace agreement came on 10 August 1917 with a Mahsud jirga. Many details of the conflict are provided in a private letter dating 20 August 1917 by Harry Edward Parker (5 Oct 1895 \u2013 25 Dec 1969). Parker fought as a British soldier in this campaign. == Aftermath == The news of the peace agreement came as a great relief to the India Office. \"The North-west frontier of India is now hopefully free of trouble.\" == References == Category:1917 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1917 Category:Wars involving British India Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:20th-century military history of the United Kingdom ",
