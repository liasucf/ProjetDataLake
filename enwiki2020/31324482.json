    "text": "Tracksuit Manager is a sports management video game that takes the conventional Football Manager game style from the 1980s in a various number of methods. ==Summary== The Amiga magazine Advanced Computer Entertainment gives this game an official rating of 606 out of 1000 (60.6%) in its April 1989 issue. While \u00a39.95 was the full manufacturer's price for the game (\u00a3 in today's money), it could be bought from budget retailers for only \u00a32.99 (\u00a3 in today's money). The player controls an international football team who has failed to perform adequately in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and must qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup through the 1988 European Championships. Instead of a transfer market, the player is given a choice between 100 eligible football players and must choose from 22 of them. The matches are presented in the running commentary style of sports announcing with a small graphic depicting where the ball is. Players must qualify for the 1988 UEFA European Football Championships in West Germany. All the famous football players like Peter Shilton and Diego Maradona are included in this game. There is an England player called 'Breacher' in the game. In reality there was no recognised top flight footballer with this name. Many commentators assume that this error was due to a typo of the name of then Luton Town player Tim Breacker. Players are rated on their various attributes, using the following terms (ranked worst to best): Grim Very Poor Suffering Poor Disappointing Below Average Useful Good Very Good Excellent Brilliant World Class Best in the World These terms apply to confidence: Rock Bottom Almost .. Even Lower Very Low Low Lacking O.K. Fine Good High Sky High Even Higher Absolute These terms apply to stamina: Cannot Stand Cannot Walk Cannot Run Shouldn't Play Not Good Lacking Below Par Not at his Best He'll Pass No Problem Very Fit Extremely Fit Run all Day The 55 teams are also ranked, on the Grim to Best in the World scale, according to defence, midfield and attack. New Zealand are the weakest team. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Daley Thompson's Olympic Challenge.http://ysrnry.co.uk/ys37.htm There are appreciable skill level differences between versions. The Commodore version sees teams such as Argentina, Brazil and Italy, for example, downgraded from Excellent ratings, compared to that of the Amstrad version. World Class ratings are now downgraded to Brilliant, and no players have Best In The World in their statistics. There is also a confidence rating of \"Confident\" that goalkeepers sometimes have, which does not appear in the list above. ==References== Category:1988 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Association football management video games Category:Atari ST games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games ",
