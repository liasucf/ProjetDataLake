    "text": "The is a Japanese order, established on 4 January 1888 by Emperor Meiji as the Order of Meiji. Originally awarded in eight classes (from 8th to 1st, in ascending order of importance), since 2003 it has been awarded in six classes, the lowest two medals being abolished that year. The most widely conferred Japanese order, it is awarded to those who have made distinguished achievements in research fields, business industries, healthcare, social work, state/local government fields or the improvement of life for handicapped/impaired persons.Order of the Sacred Treasure profile , www8.cao.go.jp; accessed 6 July 2014. Originally a male-only decoration, the order has been made available to women since 1919; it is awarded for both civil and military merit, though of a lesser degree than that required for the conferment of the Order of the Rising Sun. ==Classes== The Order can be awarded in any of six classes. Conventionally, a diploma is prepared to accompany the insignia of the order, and in some rare instances, the personal signature of the emperor will have been added. As an illustration of the wording of the text, a translation of a representative 1929 diploma says: > \"By the grace of Heaven, Emperor of Japan, seated on the throne occupied by > the same dynasty from time immemorial, We confer the Second Class of the > Imperial Order of Meiji upon Henry Waters Taft, a citizen of the United > States of America and a director of the Japan Society of New York, and > invest him with the insignia of the same class of the Order of the Double > Rays of the Rising Sun, in expression of the good will which we entertain > towards him. \"In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hand and caused > the Grand Seal of State to be affixed at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, this > thirteenth day of the fifth month of the fourth year of Sh\u014dwa, corresponding > to the 2,589th year from the accession to the throne of Emperor Jimmu.\"Honor > awarded 1929 \u2013 \"Japanese Emperor Honors H.W. Taft; Consul-General Gives > Insignia for Fostering International Friendship. Diploma Also Presented; > Brother of Chief Justice Receives Order of Rising Sun at Exercises Here,\" > New York Times, 28 June 1929. ==Insignia== The insignia of the order incorporates symbols for the three imperial treasures: the Yata Mirror, so sacred that not even the Emperor is allowed to look at it; the Yasakani Jewel, which is made of the finest jade; and the Emperor's personal sword. The star for the Grand Cordon and Second Class is similar to the badge as described above, but effectively with two sets of Maltese crosses, one in gilt and one placed diagonally in silver. It is worn on the left chest by the Grand Cordon, on the right chest (without any other insignia) by the 2nd class. The badge for the first through sixth classes is a Maltese cross, in gilt (1st\u20134th classes), gilt and silver (5th class) and silver (6th class), with white enameled rays (representing the sword). The central disc is blue, bearing an eight-pointed silver star (representing the mirror), surrounded by a wreath with red-enameled dots (representing the jewel). The badge is suspended on a ribbon, worn as a sash on the right shoulder by the Grand Cordon, as a necklet by males of the 2nd and 3rd classes, on the left chest (the ribbon folded into a triangle) by the 4th to 6th classes (with a rosette for the 4th class). For females of the 2nd to 6th classes, the ribbon is a bow worn on the left shoulder (with a rosette for the 4th class). Until 2003, when it was abolished, the badge of the seventh and eighth classes was an eight-pointed silver medal, partially gilded for the 7th class, with representations of just the mirror and the jewel. The badge is suspended on a ribbon, worn by men on the left chest (the ribbon folded into a triangle). For women, the ribbon is a bow worn on the left shoulder. Until 2003, the ribbon of the order was very pale blue with a gold stripe near the borders; since then the ribbon has been light blue, but retains the gold stripe near the borders. When the ribbon is worn alone, the ribbon for the Fourth Class and above incorporates a blue-and-gold rosette (very pale blue until 2003), with a solid gold bar for the Grand Cordon, a gold and silver bar for the Second Class, a solid silver bar for the Third Class and only the rosette for the Fourth Class. The ribbon for the Fifth and Sixth Classes has a centered blue disc (very pale blue until 2003) with gold rays radiating from its center, eight rays for the Fifth Class and six rays for the Sixth Class. Formerly, the ribbon for the Seventh and Eighth Classes had a centered very pale blue disc with gold rays radiating from its center, four rays for the Seventh Class and three rays for the Eighth Class. {|align=center class=wikitable width=60% !colspan=2|Ribbons of the Order of the Sacred Treasure |- !colspan=2|1888\u20132003 |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |First Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Second Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Third Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Fourth Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Fifth Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Sixth Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Seventh Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Eighth Class |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |General ribbon of the order |- !colspan=2|2003\u2013present |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Grand Cordon |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Gold and Silver Star |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Gold Rays with Rosette |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Gold and Silver Rays |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |Silver Rays |- |width=25% valign=center align=center|center !width=50% |General ribbon of the order |- |} ==After the 2003 reform== In 2003 the lowest two classes of the Order were abolished.
