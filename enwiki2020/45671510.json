    "text": "A War () is a 2015 Danish war drama film written and directed by Tobias Lindholm, and starring Pilou Asb\u00e6k and S\u00f8ren Malling. It tells the story of a Danish military company in Afghanistan that is fighting the Taliban while trying to protect the civilians, and how the commander is accused of having committed a war crime. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards. ==Plot== A Danish soldier in a squad patrolling Helmand province sets off an IED. He dies from horrific injuries while his commander, Claus, can do little to help back at base camp. After that Claus resolves to join his men on every patrol. After treating an injured little girl, the Afghan family comes to the Danish base because the Taliban has threatened to kill them for asking for help. Claus makes the decision to send them back to their village. Meanwhile, back in Denmark, Claus' wife Maria is trying to hold everyday life together, with a husband at war and three children missing their father. The strain their father's absence takes on the family is seen as the burdens of parenting fall on Maria herself. The next day, Claus and his men return to the village only to find the Afghan family they had helped earlier murdered in their home. Without warning, an ambush by insurgent forces ensues. Claus, in the confusion of battle, calls in an airstrike on a nearby compound, though he knows he lacks proper identification (PID) of the enemy combatants. This decision allows the Danish troops to retreat from their position without any loss of life. However, back at base, Claus is charged with the killing 11 innocent civilians and is sent home. The grave consequences of these accusations shake him and his family. Claus' defense lawyer asserts that he needs to claim that he had PID in order to avoid a prison sentence. Though he plans to admit his guilt, Maria angrily admonishes him for not thinking of his children's lives without a father. He decides to claim he called in an airstrike because he had PID. Evidence mounts as Claus' men testify in court. His close friend and comrade, who had known him since boot camp, testifies that Claus, despite being a good officer, was feeling the strain of leadership and making rash decisions. In the witness box, Claus maintains his position. After being probed by the prosecution, he angrily declares that anyone who has never been in combat can never understand what it takes to make life and death decisions. Unexpectedly, Claus' former radio operator testifies that he identified muzzle flashes in the compound, giving Claus a plausible reason to call the airstrike. Though this evidence is dubious, it is enough to convince the judge and sub-committee that Claus had a legitimate PID. Later while tucking his young son into bed, Claus notices how his son's feet resemble those of the murdered little girl in Helmand. He sits alone outside looking at the night sky. ==Cast== * Pilou Asb\u00e6k as Claus Michael Pedersen * S\u00f8ren Malling as Martin R.
