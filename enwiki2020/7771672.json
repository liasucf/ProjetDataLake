The show portrays Isaak and his band members as everyday people with everyday problems. The series was produced for the Showtime channel from 2001\u20132004, and was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which stands in for the show's home setting of San Francisco. The series featured Isaak and several members of his band, Silvertone, portraying themselves. Other roles were portrayed by actors, including Jed Rees as Isaak's keyboardist. Rees (who had studied piano, though much of his character's keyboard work is performed by a session player) was hired in place of Isaak's actual keyboardist Brett Tuggle (a part-time band member) to add some comedy to the show. Other characters featured on the show include Yola Gaylen, Isaak's manager and her colleague, Cody Kurtzman. The final regular character, Mona, appears lying nude on her stomach on a revolving circular bed in the basement of Bimbo's, a club Isaak frequents. Through an optical illusion created with mirrors she's made to look as if swimming in an aquarium, and being called a mermaid (despite having human legs).https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/12/arts/television-review-relax- it-was-just-a-little-striptease.html Only once does she sit up, revealing her toplessness.Season 2, Episode 12 \"Farm Boys\" She typically talks only with Isaak, acting as his conscience or a sounding board for him.
