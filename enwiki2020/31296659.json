The 2-(2-2)-0 version was used by Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway between 1885 and 1887 on two unique divided drive compound tank locomotives, No. 687 (1885) and No. 600 (1887). He then produced two tender engine classes each of ten locomotives: the LNWR Greater Britain Class (1892-1894) and the LNWR John Hick Class (1894-1898). The locomotives were never reliable and Webb's successor George Whale withdrew them all within three years of taking up office in 1903. ==See also== * John Hick ==References== 22,2-2-2-2 ",
