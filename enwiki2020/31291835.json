    "text": "Leucobrephos brephoides, the scarce infant moth, is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is found from Yukon to Labrador and south to New York and southern Alberta and British Columbia. The habitat consists of open mixed wood forests of the boreal and mountain region. The wingspan is about 29 mm. Adults are on wing from March to May with a peak in mid to late April in Alberta. Generally, the flight period begins when snow patches are still on the ground. The larvae feed on Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Alnus, but have also been recorded on Salix and Populus balsamifera. All these species produce catkins early in spring, which may be important food sources prior to leave flush. ==References== Category:Archiearinae Category:Moths described in 1857 ",
