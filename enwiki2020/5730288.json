    "text": "__NOTOC__ \"Get the Message\" is a song by Electronic, the English band formed by Bernard Sumner of New Order and ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. It was the second single from their 1991 debut album Electronic and was a commercial success around the world. It is a good example of Marr and Sumner's original concept of mixing the fluid synthesizers of New Order with The Smiths' rich guitar sound. ==Composition== Marr composed the music then Sumner wrote the lyric as engineer Owen Morris played him the song every four bars.Select, November 1997 Marr was reluctant to layer multiple guitar parts as he was wary of treading ground, but Sumner convinced him otherwise.Electronic's Greatest Hits (VH1, October 2006) During recording, Primal Scream vocalist Denise Johnson added a vocal at the end of the song. She went on to provide additional vocals on a number of songs on Electronic's second album Raise the Pressure five years later.artistdirect.com ==Single== The single was issued in the UK on 7-inch, 12-inch, CD and cassette by Factory Records on 15 April 1991 (and two weeks later as a second 12-inch comprising two additional remixes by DNA), and as a three-format maxi single and standard cassette by Warner Bros. Records in the USA. {|class=\"wikitable\" !Song version !Duration |- |7-inch mix |align=\"center\"|4:05 |- |Album edit |align=\"center\"|3:53 |- |Album/12-inch version |align=\"center\"|5:18 |- |DNA Groove Mix |align=\"center\"|5:26 |- |DNA Sin Mix |align=\"center\"|5:23 |- |DNA Groove Mix Edit |align=\"center\"|3:40 |- |DNA Sin Mix Edit |align=\"center\"|3:56 |- |} \"Get the Message\" appeared as a remixed 7-inch edit on most of the formats, and in its original, full-length version on the first UK 12-inch. Later pressings of the UK 7-inch and the German CD maxi single featured an edit of the album version, which was also used for the music video. This was because Bernard Sumner objected to the earlier mix, having heard it on a Manchester radio station prior to the release of the single.NME, December 1990 The US and German maxi singles compiled all of these versions collectively; the only recordings from this single that remain scarce are edits of the two DNA remixes which were released on promos, namely a British 7-inch and a US CD maxi single. Like its predecessor \"Getting Away with It\", \"Get the Message\" featured a non-album track as its B-side: \"Free Will\", a mercurial, sample-heavy dance track. This appeared in greatly edited form on the 7-inch releases, and in its original six-minute form on all the others. (The German CD maxi single included both) An edited version is included on the 2013 re-release of the album Electronic. ==Artwork== The first releases were packaged by Johnson/Panas (the moniker of Trevor Johnson), who also designed Electronic's then imminent first album Electronic. Each format bore a unique colour scheme, all versions featuring the artist and single name with a bold number \"2\" underneath, signifying its place in Electronic's discography.FAC461 Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album (2006) The only format which differed from this theme was the second British 12-inch release, designed by 3a (who also oversaw third single \"Feel Every Beat\"). ==Track listings== ===UK 7-inch, 12-inch and MC=== # \"Get the Message\" # \"Free Will\" * The 7-inch and cassette comprised edits of both songs. ===UK remix 12-inch=== # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix) # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix) * This record was only released in Britain. ===UK CD=== # \"Get the Message\" (7\") # \"Free Will\" (12\") # \"Get the Message\" (12\") ===US maxi singles=== # \"Get the Message\" (Extended Mix) # \"Free Will\" (Extended Mix) # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix) # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix) * The CD included \"Get the Message\" (Single Mix). ===EU CD maxi single=== # \"Get the Message\" (7\") # \"Get the Message\" (12\") # \"Free Will\" (7\") # \"Free Will\" (12\") # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Groove Mix) # \"Get the Message\" (DNA Sin Mix) ==Music video== The single was promoted by a colourful music video in which Marr and Sumner strolled through the PhilippinesSelect, June 1991 and atop the still-active Taal Volcano \u2014 which Marr narrowly missed falling into.Melody Maker, 13 April 1991 It was directed by Gunther Deichmann,deichmann-photo.com whose published photographs had impressed Electronic. Marr and Sumner in the music video. At least two versions of this film exist, one with phrases from the song lyrics punctuating the scenic shots (and lower-case letters spelling out 'electronic') and another more simple edit without any words.

Electronic also promoted the single with appearances on Top of the Pops in April and May 1991, miming to the album edit and the edit of the \"DNA Groove Mix\" respectively. ==Reception== Commercial reception to the song was quite positive.
