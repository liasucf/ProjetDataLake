Dossier to the audio broadcast of 9 December 2013 was a concept of a high fidelity suitable magnetic tape cartridge or cassette from Philips for analog recordings. Tape and tape speed were identical to the Compact Cassette. == History == Since 1961, the Dutch company Philips had been working on the development of a hi-fi\u2013compatible cassette in its Vienna tape recorder factory WIRAG. The Viennese factory had experience with the development and production of dictation machines with single-hole cassettes. Based on this, the new cassette was to be created as a high quality tape system for home use. Apart from Philips itself both the Grundig as well as Philips affiliated record companies, the Philips Phonographische Industrie and the Deutsche Grammophon (German Gramophone company) were involved in its development. At the same time, a Belgian Philips team developed a two-hole cassette under the name Pocket Recorder in Eindhoven. The Philips management chose this product and put it on the market as Compact Cassette. Philips informed its partner Grundig late about this decision and in return offered Grundig to participate in the Pocket Recorder. Grundig was not happy about it and left the competitive system. Based on design drawings of the compact cassette Grundig developed the DC-International which was released in 1965. It was taken off the market only two years later. In 1948 the development of the Protona Minifon had started, which also contained both tape rolls inside the cassette. == Technology == The single-hole cassette used the tape of compact cassette 3.81 mm (= 0.15 inch) wide only at a tape speed 1\u215e inch = 4.7625 cm per second, rounded: 4.75 cm/s. To wind the tape back into the cassette, the single-hole cassette got onto its built-in tape reel ring gear with 8-teeth for traction, which represents the single hole. The second winding roll is part of the tape device, whereby the cassette can not be removed until it has been completely rewound. The second tape reel accommodated in the device increases the space required there, but makes the cassette more compact. The drive is a more elaborate design because the first tape end has to be feed from the inserted cassette on the take-up roll in the drive. For the data backup these properties were no disadvantages. With a 3\u2153 \u00d7 wide band, digital recording and modified traction, the concept of the single-hole cassette has seen yet another renaissance in more than 35 years Linear Tape-Open (LTO). == References == == External Links == * Techmoan: DC International & the forgotten audio cassette format war (DC International und der vergessene Krieg der Kassettenformate), YouTube, 19 March 2019 (In the credits with the two puppets this episode aims Article 13 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market) * (German) Innen und Au\u00dfenansicht der Einloch-Kassette von Uwe H.
