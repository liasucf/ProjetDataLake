It is sponsored by a coalition of multinational corporations, non-profit organizations, and universities. ==History== On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its \"Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy\". The Initiative was launched in the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). ==Profile== As a human rights organization, GNI seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders. GNI esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a \"human right and guarantor of human dignity\". Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users' ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Participants are also expected to protect users' personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user's privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies. Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively. GNI recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy. ==Staff and Board of Directors == *Judith Lichtenberg, Executive Director *Mark Stephens (solicitor), Independent Chair ICT Companies: Miranda Sissons, Facebook Lewis Segall, Google Steve Crown, Microsoft/LinkedIn Fiona Cura-Pitre, Nokia Yves Nissim, Orange Anita Househam, Telenor Group Patrik Hiselius, Telia Company Nicole Karlebach, Verizon Media Laura Okkonen, Vodafone Group Civil Society Organizations: Greg Nojeim, Center for Democracy & Technology Robert Mahoney, Committee to Protect Journalists Charles Bradley, Global Partners Digital Julie Owono, Internet sans Fronti\u00e8res Kat Duffy, Internews Academics and Academic Organizations: Jessica Fjeld, Berkman Klein Center Meg Roggensack, Georgetown University (Independent) K.S.
