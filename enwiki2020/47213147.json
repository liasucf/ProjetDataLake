There were 57 two-member constituencies and 282 single-member constituencies. ==State reorganization== On 1 November 1956, under States Reorganisation Act, 1956, Bombay state was enlarged by the addition of Saurashtra state and Kutch state, the Marathi-speaking districts of Nagpur Division of Madhya Pradesh, and the Marathi speaking Marathwada region of Hyderabad. The state's southernmost Kannada-speaking districts of Dharwad, Bijapur, North Kannada and Belgaum (excluding the Chandgad taluka) were transferred to Mysore state, while Abu Road taluk of the Banaskantha district was transferred to Rajasthan. Hence the constituencies increased from 315 to 396 in 1957 elections. ==Results== ==See also== * 1957 elections in India * Bombay State * 1952 Bombay Legislative Assembly election ==References== Category:1957 State Assembly elections in India Category:State Assembly elections in Maharashtra Category:1950s in Mumbai Category:Bombay State ",
