In 1973, during the administration of President Luis Echeverria Alvarez, the National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education (ANUIES), he presented a document to the President noting the need to establish a new university in the metropolitan area Mexico City, taking into consideration issues such as increasing student demand and the increasing failure of existing universities to admit more students. It then proposed that the nascent university project also constituted an opportunity to modernize higher education in the country. The expected characteristics of the new university were it to be public, metropolitan, independent, innovative addition to its educational and organizational terms. It is under such expectations that the law comes into force for the creation of the Autonomous Metropolitan University, on 1 January 1974. On 10 January of that year, he was appointed first Rector of the UAM architect Pedro Ramirez Vazquez. The University is established since its creation three units, which are located in Iztapalapa, Azcapotzalco and Xochimilco, with the idea of promoting decentralization and allow the full development of each. Empirically, scientific research in Iztapalapa (UAM-I) Unit is located, the traditional careers such as civil engineering and architecture at the Azcapotzalco (UAM-A) unit and the area of health in the Xochimilco Unit (UAM -X). Subsequently, it was decided that their internal organization would be composed of divisions and academic departments, creating a contrast with the Schools and Colleges of existing universities. Each division would group different areas of knowledge and related disciplines each department, in order to give a flexible structure that prevents the lag that education has suffered in relation to the progress of science. The first Rector of the Iztapalapa Unit was Dr. Alonso Fernandez Gonz\u00e1lez and began operations on September 30, 1974. In turn, the Rector of the Azcapotzalco Unit was Dr. Juan Casillas Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n, which opened its doors 11 November 1974. For the Xochimilco was Rector Dr. Ramon Villarreal Perez, initiating teaching also the November 11, 1974. Recently, the possibility of creating a new unit of the UAM was analyzed. The April 26, 2005 the Academic College of the institution approved the creation of the Cuajimalpa campus, appointing in June of that year Dr. Fres\u00e1n Magdalena Orozco as the first Rector. The activities of the Unit officially pulled the September 14, 2005, using different locations, at first at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Then he took three temporary facilities: Baja California, Artifice and Constituents Constituents adding a fourth in 647.
