Born in San Francisco, California, Oberti lived and worked there until 1978, when he moved to Sonoma County in order to devote his life to art and ceramics.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pressdemocrat/obituary.aspx?n=daniel- oberti&pid;=127019307#sthash.4VCV51w2.dpuf Oberti\u2019s best-known local sculpture, titled \u201cGuardian of the Creek,\u201d popularly known as \u201cThe Fish,\u201d is located at Gateway Park, near the entrance to the Prince Memorial Greenway on Santa Rosa Avenue. \"The Fish\" is a 13-foot-tall, mosaic-covered statue of a rainbow trout was designed by Mario Uribe and created by Oberti and students in Santa Rosa\u2019s Artstart program for artists in training. During his long career at Artstart, Oberti also created two prominently placed concrete-and- brass sculptures: \u201cThree Spheres,\u201d at the Hyatt Vineyard Creek Hotel on the Prince Memorial Greenway, and \u201cShadow Catcher, \u201d at Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa. One of Oberti's largest projects titled \"Star Dancers\" was a collaboration with astronomer Maria Sundin of Gothenburg, Sweden. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241387571_Star_Dancers_collaboration_between_an_Astronomer_and_an_Artist In this project Oberti created works based on Sundin's discoveries of the intricate and fascinating orbits of certain stars in barred galaxies. Oberti sketched newly discovered star patterns in clay, which served as a canvas to interpret Sundin's simulations in an artistic and sculptural format. The work presented cutting edge discoveries of star paths within the scope of a most ancient art form - that of potterymaking and sculpture. According to Sundin, \"The \"Star Dancers\" project is a provocative enhancement of our collaboration... For [me], this [was] an entirely new way to reach a wider audience with [my] new research results. For Oberti, [it was] an expansive and creative explosion of new works which pay homage to astronomical themes from the archaic to the contemporary.\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241387571_Star_Dancers_collaboration_between_an_Astronomer_and_an_Artist Oberti's outdoor artworks can be seen throughout the Bay Area in Healdsburg, Penngrove, Rohnert Park and Mendocino. Oberti\u2019s international work includes the \u201cVenus\u201d sphere created for the world\u2019s largest scale model of the solar system, in Stockholm, Sweden,Sweden Solar System and sculptures in Onsala, Sweden and Palermo, Italy. Oberti died peacefully at the age of 64 from cancer on May 2, 2009 at his home in Sebastopol. \"The sphere is the most perfect, the most capricious of figures, wherein neither beginning nor end can be found.\" - Copernicus. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American artists ",
