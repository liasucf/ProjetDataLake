Retrieved: 28 June 2011. Crews from No. 51 Squadron trained alongside the United States Air Force on the RC-135W Rivet Joint, which entered service with the RAF in 2014 under the Airseeker project. ==History== ===World War I=== 51 Squadron Royal Flying Corps flew B.E.2 and B.E.12 aircraft; the squadron formed at Thetford, Norfolk, before moving its headquarters to the airfield that later became RAF Marham. The squadron's primary role during the First World War was defence of the UK against German Zeppelin raids. It also used the Avro 504K to give night flying training to new pilots. The squadron disbanded in 1919. ===Interwar years=== The squadron was reborn when 'B' Flight of 58 Squadron was renumbered as 51 Squadron at Driffield in March 1937, flying Virginias and Ansons. At this time the squadron badge was being chosen and a goose was chosen as a play on words: the squadron was flying the Anson and the Latin for goose is Anser. It was also appropriate for a bomber unit to have a heavy wild fowl to represent it.Moyes 1976, p. 78. ===World War II=== 51 Squadron dropped leaflets over Germany on the very first night of the Second World War, using the Whitley aircraft; bombs replaced leaflets in early 1940. A brief period as part of Coastal Command patrolling against the U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay preceded the re-equipment with the Halifax in 1942. 51 spent the rest of the war in Europe flying as part of No. 4 Group RAF, RAF Bomber Command's strategic bombing offensive against the Nazis, operating from RAF Snaith in East Yorkshire. ===Postwar=== The squadron became part of Transport Command with Stirlings and later Yorks following the end of the European war, transporting men and material to India and the Far East. The squadron disbanded in 1950, after taking part in the Berlin Airlift. The squadron again reformed in the 'Special Duties' role when No. 192 Squadron RAF was renumbered at RAF Watton on 21 August 1958, moving to nearby Wyton in April 1963.Lake 2001, p. 130\u2013131. It was only following the end of the Cold War that the signals intelligence role of the squadron was publicly recognised. Signals intelligence encompasses both Electronic Intelligence (Elint) and Communications Intelligence (Comint). The squadron flew this role using de Havilland Comets. The Comets were replaced by a modified version of the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod in 1974. One of the three Nimrods on strength was retired at the end of November 2009 with the other two remaining in service until June 2011. The Nimrods were replaced by three Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft. In January 2011 personnel from 51 Squadron began training at Offutt Air Force Base in the US for conversion to the RC-135. Crews were to be deployed on joint missions with the USAF 343rd Reconnaissance Squadron until the new aircraft became available. The first RC135W (ZZ664) was delivered to the Royal Air Force on 12 November 2013, and entered operational service in 2014, taking part in Operation Shader against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. ==Aircraft operated== Aircraft operated have included: *B.E.2 *B.E.12 *FE2b *Martynside Elephant G.100 *Avro 504K *Sopwith Camel *Vickers Virginia Mk10 *Avro Anson Mk1 *Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk 2\u20135 *Handley Page Halifax Mk B2 and B3 *Short Stirling Mk5 *Avro York *de Havilland Comet Mk2R *English Electric Canberra B2 *Hastings C1 *Nimrod R1 *Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint ==See also== *Other Nimrod squadrons **No. 42 (Reserve) Squadron \u2013 Nimrod OCU **No. 120 Squadron **No. 201 Squadron **No. 206 Squadron *List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons *No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== *Ford, Keith S.
