    "text": "Gifford Pinchot National Forest is a National Forest located in southern Washington, USA, managed by the United States Forest Service. With an area of 1.32 million acres (5300 km2), it extends 116 km along the western slopes of Cascade Range from Mount Rainier National Park to the Columbia River. The forest straddles the crest of the South Cascades of Washington State, spread out over broad, old growth forests, high mountain meadows, several glaciers, and numerous volcanic peaks. The forest's highest point is at 12,276 ft. at the top of Mount Adams, the second tallest volcano in the state after Rainier. Often found abbreviated GPNF on maps and in texts, it includes the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, established by Congress in 1982. ==History== A U.S. Forest Service ranger and cattle grazer permittee on a hillside with cattle in Gifford Pinchot National Forest, Washington in 1949 Gifford Pinchot National Forest is one of the older national forests in the United States. Included as part of the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve in 1897, was set aside as the Columbia National Forest on July 1, 1908. In 1855, the US government commissioned Washington Territory to negotiate land cession treaties with tribes around the forest. The Yakama tribe signed a treaty agreement that stipulated their moving to a reservation while maintaining off- reservation resource rights; however, the original treaty was then broken in 1916 when the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that Yakamas' hunting off the reservation had to subscribe to state fish and game laws. Many tribes in the area have continued to use the area's resources while encountering non- Native hunters, fishers, and recreation users. It was later renamed the Gifford Pinchot National Forest on June 15, 1949 in honor of Gifford Pinchot, one of the leading figures in the creation of the national forest system of the United States. In 1985 the non-profit Gifford Pinchot Task Force formed to promote conservation of the forest. ==Geography== Map of Gifford Pinchot National Forest Lower Falls of the Lewis River Mount Adams early morning reflection at Takhlakh Lake Mount Adams above Olallie Lake Horseshoe Lake Gifford Pinchot National Forest is located in a mountainous region approximately between Mount St. Helens to the west, Mount Adams to the east, Mount Rainier National Park to the north, and the Columbia River to the south. This region of Southwest Washington is noted for its complex topography and volcanic geology. About 65 percent of the forest acreage is located in Skamania County. In descending order of land area the others are Lewis, Yakima, Cowlitz, and Klickitat. counties.http://www.fs.fed.us/land/staff/lar/2007/TABLE_6.htm === Major rivers === The Pacific Northwest brings abundant rainfall to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, feeding an extensive network of rivers. The forest has only one river currently designated as Wild and Scenic, the White Salmon River, fed from glaciers high on Mount Adams. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest recommends four rivers to be added to the Wild and Scenic System. They are the Lewis River, the Cispus River, the Clear Fork and the Muddy Fork of the Cowlitz River. There are an additional thirteen rivers in the forest being studied for consideration into the national Wild and Scenic River System. The following listed are the major streams and rivers of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Many of these provide excellent fishing. * Cispus River * Cowlitz River * White Salmon River * Little White Salmon River * Wind River * Lewis River * Muddy River * East Canyon Creek * Skate Creek * Iron Creek * Trout Lake Creek * Cultus Creek * Quartz Creek * Butter Creek * Clear Creek * Siouxon Creek * Canyon Creek * Johnson Creek === Major lakes === The Gifford Pinchot National Forest includes many popular and secluded backcountry lakes. Most of the lakes offers excellent fishing. Goose Lake is known for the best fishing in the State of Washington.

Douglas Wilderness acreage breakdown, Wilderness.net * The Shark Rock Wilderness was proposed in the mid-1970s by E.M. Sterling for the 75,000 acre Dark Divide Roadless Area in his book, The South Cascades. It is the largest unprotected roadless area (allowing motorized access) in the Washington Cascades, featuring sharp peaks and deep canyons, old growth forests, and delicate subalpine meadows. === Points of interest === Summit of Silver Star with Mount St. Helens in the background The forest also offers the following special areas and points of interest: :* Dark Divide Roadless Area :* Silver Star Scenic Area :* Lava Tubes, Caves, and Casts (notably the Ice Caves) :* Ape Caves :* Midway High Lakes Area :* Big Lava Bed :* Packwood Lake :* Berry Fields, (notably the world-renowned Sawtooth Berry Fields) :* Lone Butte Wildlife Emphasis Area ==Forest Service management== The forest supervisor's office is located in Vancouver, Washington. There are local ranger district offices in Randle, Amboy, and Trout Lake.USFS Ranger Districts by State The forest is named after the first chief of the United States Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot. Washington towns near entrances of the forest include Cougar, Randle, Packwood, Trout Lake and Carson. The Rugged Tatoosh Range from Paradise. == Ecology == A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the Forest was , some of which is contained within its wilderness areas. Northern Spotted Owl, found in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest The Gifford Pinchot National Forest is the native habitat for several threatened species which include the spotted owl (threatened 2012) as well as multiple species of Northwest fish like the bull trout (threatened 1998), chinook salmon (threatened 2011), coho salmon (threatened 2011) and steelhead (threatened 2011). People for over 6,000 years have made an impact in the ecology of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Native Americans hunted in high meadows below receding glaciers. The natives then began to manage the forest to meet their own needs. One method they used was to burn specific areas to help in the huckleberry production. About 338 spots more than 6,000 culturally modified trees were identified, of which 3,000 are protected now. Archaeological investigations on the forest continually find new information to this day about the past lifestyles of the Native Americans. The forest is home to the Big Tree at the southern flank of Mt Adams, one of the world's largest Ponderosa Trees. ==See also== * Wind River Arboretum ==References== == External links == * Official website * Gifford Pinchot Task Force Category:Cascade Range Category:National Forests of Washington (state) Category:Protected areas of Clark County, Washington Category:Protected areas of Cowlitz County, Washington Category:Protected areas of Klickitat County, Washington Category:Protected areas of Lewis County, Washington Category:Protected areas of Skamania County, Washington Category:Protected areas of Yakima County, Washington Category:Protected areas established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Washington (state) ",
