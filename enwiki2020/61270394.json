Farmer was also heavily involved in the women\u2019s political rights movement and frequently wrote letters to her representatives if she was unpleased by public affairs. Farmer also advocated for prison reform and against voting discrimination. Farmer\u2019s educational background is extensive. She served as the head of the political science and history department at Alabama College for Women [now the University of Montevallo] from 1927-1949 and later as the Dean of the Social Sciences Department from 1949-1956. ==Education== Farmer attended Terre Haute Normal School (now Indiana State University) for a B.S. and graduated in 1917.

Alabama State College for Women, now the University of Montevallo, holds annual lectures for social sciences dubbed the \u201cHallie Farmer Lecture Series\u201d and has scholarships in her name.
