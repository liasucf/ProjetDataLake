The original family gave rise to several branches, one of which became Dukes of Medina Sidonia from the 15th century to the 18th century, in turn giving rise to other branches including the Count-Dukes of Olivares. ==Origin== The founder of what became the House of Guzm\u00e1n was a Castilian nobleman named Rodrigo Mu\u00f1oz de Guzm\u00e1n, who is first seen in the mid 12th- century as tenente (Lord) of Roa and lord of the village of Guzm\u00e1n in Burgos. The family would come to be known by a toponymic surname indicating their derivation from the latter village. Rodrigo last appears in January 1186.Gonzalo Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez, \"Or\u00edgenes familiares de Santo Domingo, los linajes de Aza y Guzm\u00e1n\", in Santo Domingo de Caleruega en sus contexto socio- pol\u00edtico, 1170-1221, Luis Vicente D\u00edez Mart\u00edn and C\u00e1ndido Aniz Iriarte, eds., (Monumenta Hist\u00f3rica Iberoamericana de la Orden de Predicadores, no. 5), Salamanca: Jornadas de estudios medievales, 1994, pp. 173-228 By the 15th century, as related by Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n in his Generaciones y Semblanzas, the family had developed multiple origin traditions. One of these traced the family from a certain Count Ramiro, who had taken as wife or lover the daughter of a King of Le\u00f3n. A second legend indicated that among those from diverse nations taking part in the Reconquest was a brother of the Duke of Brittany, named Gudeman (meaning 'good man'). The legend, as related by Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, tells that Gudeman remained south of the Pyrenees, married into the lineage of Count Ramiro, and the family derived their name from him, in the derivative form of Guzm\u00e1n. Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n dismisses this unsupported legend, saying that there are no records of the tale, save for the memories of men.(anon.), Cent\u00f3n epistolario del Bachiller Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez de Cibdareal, Generaciones y Semblanzas del Noble Caballero Fernan Perez de Guzman, Claros Varones de Castilla, y Letras de Fernando de Pulger, Madrid: Imprenta Real de Gazeta, 1775, pp. 227-8 All that is known about the authentic ancestry of founder Rodrigo Mu\u00f1oz is found in his patronymic and toponymic, indicating his father was named Munio (or perhaps Nu\u00f1o) and he was from Guzm\u00e1n. Early historians would make Ramiro Mu\u00f1oz the grandfather of Saint Dominic, but modern genealogical research finds no evidence for such a connection. One of Rodrigo's sons, Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Guzm\u00e1n was killed fighting for king Alfonso VIII of Castile at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195.Salazar y Acha, \"Precisiones y nuevos datos . . . \", p. 223 Pedro's son, Guill\u00e9n P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, would fight for the same king at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212,S\u00e1nchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana en la plena Edad Media, vol. I, pp. 236\u2013237, note 102 and was father of Mayor Guill\u00e9n de Guzm\u00e1n, one of the mistresses of king Alfonso X of Castile and by him mother of Beatrice of Castile (1242\u20131303), queen of Portugal.Mart\u00edn Prieto, \"La fundaci\u00f3n del monasterio de Santa Clara de Alcocer\", pp. 240\u2013241 ==Rise to prominence== Coat of arms of the Duke of Medina Sidonia The family rose to greater prominence under the leadership of Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n (1256\u20131309), otherwise known as Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno (Guzm\u00e1n the Good), nobleman and soldier under Sancho IV of Castile.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro In 1282, that king's father, Alfonso X, had rewarded Guzm\u00e1n's services with the town of Alcal\u00e1 Sidonia, today Alcal\u00e1 de los Gazules, who would exchange him that same year for the Donad\u00edo de Monteagudo (now a farmhouse in the municipality of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda). In addition, the king married him to Mar\u00eda Alfonso Coronel, a rich woman who would contribute to the marriage a very important dowry, composed of houses in the collation (feligres\u00eda) of San Miguel in Seville, olive groves of Torrijos (now a hacienda in Valencina de la Concepci\u00f3n), Olive groves of La Roba\u00edna (in Pilas), the town of Bollullos de la Mitaci\u00f3n, the ace\u00f1as (flour mills) that were in the Guadalete river next to Jerez de la Frontera, the payment of La Ina vineyard (now a rural neighborhood in Jerez de la Frontera) and the vineyard payment of El Barroso (now a farmhouse in Jerez de la Frontera).[2] The Guzm\u00e1n lineage continued throughout the Middle Ages in the reconquest of the southern peninsula against the Arabs and was established as a noble house of first rank, achieving its climax with the conquest of Granada, playing a leading role in the Castilian politics. This line of Guzman, like others of the Civil War of the mid-fourteenth century, within the one hundred year war, continued through the male line to change the surname for female line in the family inheritance until 1779 in the main title with that of the \u00c1lvarez de Toledo lineage.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro Several current Spanish noble families derive from the House of Guzman: the House of Duke of Medina-Sidonia, as direct heirs of Beatriz Castilla, and its small Ducal House of Fernandina. From the House of Medinasidonia (Dukes since 1440) come the lesser noble houses of the Marquesados de Cazaza (in the House of Guzm\u00e1n since 1504) and Gibraltar (created in 1390 for Enrique de Guzm\u00e1n, son of the Count of Fog) from which There were and there are many gentlemen in the C\u00e1diz region.Alonso de Haro, Libro de oro == Notes == ==References== * El libro de Oro de los reyes, Ed.
