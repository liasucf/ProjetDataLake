Its population is 17,030 and its area is . ==Name== The city was named after the Portuguese colony Mazag\u00e3o in North Africa, now El Jadida, which the Portuguese abandoned in 1769 after some 250 years of occupation. Many of its inhabitants were evacuated to Brazil, where they founded a new settlement Nova Mazag\u00e3o (), now known as Mazag\u00e3o Velho. A total of 340 families arrived in the city of Bel\u00e9m in 1770 and in 1773 went to Nova Mazag\u00e3o. One of the main theories on the origin of the name of Mazagaon - one of the original Seven Islands of Bombay and still a historic neighborhood of Mumbai, India - derives this name, too, from the Moroccan city, since both were under Portuguese rule in the same time. ==Conservation== The municipality contains 44% of the Rio Cajari Extractive Reserve, created in 1990. It contains 19% of the Rio Iratapuru Sustainable Development Reserve, created in 1997. It contains part of the Jari Ecological Station. It also contains 8.56% of the Amap\u00e1 State Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit established in 2006. ==References== Category:Municipalities in Amap\u00e1 Category:Populated places established in 1773 ",
