Tehuetzquititzin became both tlatoani and governor of Tenochtitlan in 1541, after the death of the previous governor, don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin. In the same year, he participated in the Mixt\u00f3n War in Nueva Galicia (Nahuatl: Xochipillan), led by viceroy Antonio de Mendoza.Chimalpahin (1997): vol. 1, p. 173; vol. 2, p. 41. Don Diego's coat of arms. On 23 December 1546, a c\u00e9dula was issued by Charles V and his mother Joanna granting don Diego a personal coat of arms in recognition of his service, particularly in the war in Nueva Galicia, and so that \"other [Indian] nobles will be inspired to serve us\". His arms included the indigenous symbol of Tenochtitlan \u2014 a prickly pear cactus growing out of a stone in the middle of a lake \u2014 which would centuries later feature in the coat of arms of Mexico, as well as an eagle that may represent Huitzilopochtli.Casta\u00f1eda de la Paz (2009): pp. 140\u2013143; Paz y Melia (1892): p. 257. Tehuetzquititzin died in 1554, having ruled for 14 years. Rather than being immediately replaced by a successor, don Esteban de Guzm\u00e1n came to Tenochtitlan as juez de residencia. He remained as juez until 1557, when don Crist\u00f3bal de Guzm\u00e1n Cecetzin was installed as ruler.Chimalpahin (1997): vol. 1, p. 177. ==Personal life== He took as his Christian wife his first cousin, do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, with whom he had two children, don Alonso Tezcatl Popocatzin and don Pablo (or Pedro) Mauhcaxochitzin, both of whom died young. By other women he had also had children named don Miguel (or Pablo) Ixcuinantzin (who also died young), don Pedro Xiconocatzin, don Jos\u00e9 Xaxaqualiuhtocatzin, don Baltasar Ilhuicaxochitzin (who also died young), do\u00f1a Juana, do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Tlacoyehuatzin, do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Francisca, another do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, and do\u00f1a Cecilia.Chimalpahin (1997): vol. 1, pp. 153, 155, 175; vol. 2, pp. 97, 99, 105, 115, 117. ==See also== *List of Tenochtitlan rulers ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Year of birth missing Category:1554 deaths Category:Tenochca tlatoque Category:Governors of San Juan Tenochtitlan ",
