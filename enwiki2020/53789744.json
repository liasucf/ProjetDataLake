He was the founding president of the French Association of Private Enterprises (AFEP). On his death, President Jacques Chirac called him \"one of the great figures of French capitalism.\" ==Early life== Ambroise Roux was born on 26 June 1921 in Piscop, France. His father, Andr\u00e9 Roux, was a manager in the newspaper industry. His mother, C\u00e9cile Marcilhacy, was related to the founders of Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc, a pharmaceutical company now known as Sanofi. Roux graduated from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. During World War II, he was a student at the \u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech and Sup\u00e9lec. ==Career== Shortly after the war, Roux worked for his maternal family company, Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc. In 1951, he began working as an advisor to the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Jean-Marie Louvel. In 1955, he was hired by the Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. He succeeded his former boss Louvel as its president and chief executive in 1970. During his tenure, he built a private lift for himself and he banned female employees from wearing trousers.
