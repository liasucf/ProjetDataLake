Matt plays in the fly-half (and occasionally inside centre) position for Top League club Yamaha J\u00fabilo, and formerly in the Mitre 10 Cup for North Harbour and Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) rugby league club the Melbourne Storm. He is the son of rugby league legend, Hugh McGahan. ==Early life== McGahan came to the attention of national selectors at the age of 17, after he was selected in the New Zealand secondary schools team against Australia in 2010. He attended Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland, where he excelled in its first XV. Despite numerous approaches from rugby union while still at school, McGahan decided to take up a rugby league contract with the Melbourne Storm in the NRL's under-20s competition. ==References== Category:1993 births Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:Living people Category:North Harbour rugby union players Category:Blues (Super Rugby) players Category:New Zealand rugby league players ",
