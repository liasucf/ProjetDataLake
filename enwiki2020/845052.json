    "text": "Stockland Green is an area of Birmingham, England. It gives its name to a ward which is part of the Erdington formal district, and is located to the south- west of Erdington and north-east of Birmingham City Centre. The ward comprises the areas Gravelly Hill as well as Stockland Green itself. The area is often mistakenly identified as Erdington, normally through domestic and commercial addresses. The area however has its own council ward and is outside Erdington's traditional boundaries, previously in the Birmingham Aston constituency. ==Demographics== The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 23,060 people living in the ward with a population density of 4,487 people per km\u00b2 compared with 3,649 people per km\u00b2 for Birmingham. 24.7% (5,706) of the ward's population consists of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. ==Politics== The ward was dominated by the Labour Party between the mid-1980s to 2007 and sent three Labour councillors to Birmingham City Council. However, in 2008 this changed when Matt Bennett won for the local Conservative Party. Stockland Green has a Ward Support Officer. ==Places of interest== Points of interest include Witton Cemetery, one of the largest cemeteries in the Midlands, which can be seen from the M6 motorway. Other areas include the Josiah Mason/Stockland Green complex of schools and colleges and Witton lakes, an area of local beauty. A rocky outcrop is located along the Tyburn Road. There are two major areas of open space; Bleak Hill Recreation Ground and Brookvale Park, which contains a large lake. Stockland Green Community Leisure Centre serves the area. ==Transport== Three major roads dissect the area; Tyburn Road (A38), Gravelly Hill (A5127) and Reservoir Road (A4040). The M6 motorway is situated in the southern boundary of the ward. Gravelly Hill railway station on the Cross-City Line is the only railway station within the ward. ==References== ==External links== *Birmingham City Council: Stockland Green Ward Category:Wards of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Erdington Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands ",
