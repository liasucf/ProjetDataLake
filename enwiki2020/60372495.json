    "text": "Vega flight VV07 () is the Vega space launch, of the Per\u00faSAT-1 and 4 SkySat satellites. == Payload == The flight was a multi-payload mission that deployed 5 Earth observation satellites into orbit, with a total payload mass of about including the satellites, their adapters and dispensers. === Per\u00faSAT-1 === Per\u00faSAT-1, with a mass of approximately , was in the lower position and was the last satellite to be separated, approximately 1 hour, 42 minutes and 59 seconds after lift-off. It was deployed into a sun-synchronous orbit with perigee and apogee altitudes of respectively and , and an inclination of 98.2\u00b0 as target. It later reached autonomously its quasi-circular operational orbit at in altitude. === SkySat-4 to -7 === The 4 SkySats, numbered 4 to 7, with individual masses of approximately , were in the upper position. Their target orbit was a sun-synchronous orbit with a semi-major axis of (perigee of and apogee of ) and an inclination of 97.4\u00b0. They were deployed one by one every 2 seconds starting approximately 40 minutes and 21 seconds after lift-off. == Mission description == === Launch date === The launch took place on at 01:43:35UTC ( at 22:43:35 local time) from the ELV launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. === Timeline === The mission last approximately 2 hours, 6 minutes and 38 seconds until re-entry of the third stage into the Earth's lower atmosphere. === Statistics === The mission was the launch of the Vega launcher (the out of 2 in ), and the Arianespace mission (the out of 11 that year). == References == == External links == * Vega Flight VV07 \u2013 Arianespace Category:Vega (rocket) Category:2016 in French Guiana Category:2016 in spaceflight Category:Rocket launches in 2016 ",
