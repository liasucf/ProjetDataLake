It is currently a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MAI) and exercises its powers and policy in the accordance with the ministry. It was originally founded as the Border Guard Troops, and later the Border Guard Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova. It would remain a military branch until a 2012 government reform, putting it under the control of the MAI. The Day of the Border Police is celebrated annually on 10 June. ==History== Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly elected first President of Moldova, Mircea Snegur founded the border police on September 3, 1991. The administration of the border troops was entrusted to the Ministry of National Security of Moldova under the subordination of the entire subunit of the former Soviet Border Troops deployed on Moldovan territory. On January 11, 1992, Colonel Vasile Calmoi was appointed as the first commander of the boarder troops. In accordance with a government decree which was signed on June 15, 1992, the Moldovan Border Troops became an official separate branch of the armed forces, with the law \"On the State Border of the Republic of Moldova\", coming into force by November 1994. Border guards day was first celebrated in Moldova on May 27, 1995 as the professional holiday of the Border Guard Troops of Moldova, before later being celebrated annually on June 10, which marks the day that President Snegur handed the flag of the border troops to promoted Brigader General Calmoi. In December 1999, the Moldovan Border Guard was reorganized into the Department of the Border Guard Troops of the Republic of Moldova and was withdrawn from the Ministry of National Security a month and a half later. On December 1, 2005 the European Union Border Assistance Mission to the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) was launched and on July 13, 2006, the EUBAM Territorial Office in Moldova and Ukraine was opened by the Border Guard Service. On January 10, 2007, the border service established the National Border Police College in Chisinau. On July 1, 2012, the Prime Minister Vlad Filat signed a law, which would shift the border service from the armed forces to the internal affairs ministry.http://www.border.gov.md/index.php/ro/politia-de- frontiera/istoriahttp://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc\u27e8=1&id;=306988 ==Responsibilities== In the field of border management, the border police's main purpose is to fight against illegal migration and cross-border crime.
