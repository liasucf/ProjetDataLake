Edward Bell Backhouse and Mary Anne Emmeline Walford. He was educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. ==Military career== Graduating from Sandhurst, Backhouse was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Suffolk Regiment, a line infantry regiment of the British Army, on 25 February 1914. Two of his fellow graduates were Eric Dorman-Smith and Gerard Bucknall. He was posted to the regiment's 2nd Battalion, then stationed in Curragh, Ireland, as part of the 14th Brigade of Major General Charles Fergusson's 5th Division. Sent to France with his battalion in the opening stages of the First World War in mid-August 1914, he was wounded and captured at the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August, less than a month after the outbreak of war. He was promoted to captain on 1 January 1917, while still a prisoner of war (POW). Following his release after the end of the war, Backhouse returned to service with the Suffolk Regiment. Between 1927 and 1928 he attended the Staff College, Camberley, and from 1929 to 1932 he was a staff captain in Southern Command. He then served as a brigade major of the 10th Infantry Brigade before becoming Officer commanding (OC), Depot Suffolk Regiment in 1934. Between 1936 and 1938 Backhouse held various positions at the War Office, and from 1938 to 1939 he was Commanding officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Suffolk Regiment. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Backhouse became commander of the 54th Infantry Brigade, a newly created second-line Territorial Army unit which formed part of the 18th Infantry Division. After training in the United Kingdom for just over two years, the brigade, along with the rest of the 18th Division, was deployed to British Malaya. Backhouse led the 54th Brigade during the Battle of Singapore and following the British garrison's surrender was taken as a prisoner of war, for the second time in his military career, by the Japanese. He was released from capture at the end of the war and in 1946 he was mentioned in dispatches for his leadership during the fall of Singapore in 1942. On 10 February 1948 Backhouse retired from the regular army with the honorary rank of brigadier. From 1947 to 1957 Backhouse served as the honorary colonel of the Suffolk Regiment, and in 1949 he was made a Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk. He was made a Vice-Lieutenant for the county in 1965. From 1953 to 1959 Backhouse was chairman of the Suffolk Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Association. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1961 New Year Honours. ==Personal life== He married Eileen No\u00ebl Newby Jenks in Colchester in 1920; together they had one son, Colin Backhouse and one daughter, June Backhouse. ==References== ==External links== * British Army Officers 1939\u20131945 * Generals of World War II Category:1895 births Category:1973 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British World War I prisoners of war Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Suffolk Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:People educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate Category:People from Ipswich Category:Suffolk Regiment officers Category:World War I prisoners of war held by Germany Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Japan ",
