    "text": "Volumography is the science, art and practice of creating three-dimensional space images by analyzing light or other electromagnetic radiation captured on a camera and calculating the volumetric measurements of recorded objects and deducting their geometry. Volumography is the combined art and practice of range imaging with photography or cinematography. Volumography images can be static for usages such as 3D printing, or dynamic for 3D moving image applications like virtual reality or augmented reality. The final images created are known as volumetric video. The term was introduced by Addie Reiss, the cinematographer leading the development of the Mantis Vision volumographic Ring studio. ==See also== * Project Tango Category:3D imaging ",
