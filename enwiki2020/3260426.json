Its singles were \"Bluetonic\", \"Slight Return\" and \"Cut Some Rug\". A 2 CD Expanded Edition of the album was released on 9 March 2009. ==Reception== Sam Taylor in Q wrote, \"Perhaps the most accomplished rock debut album since The Stone Roses in 1989, Expecting to Fly avoids the usual primitive drive of first recordings, in favour of technical brilliance and adventurous songwriting... a classic rock album.\" List journalist Brian Donaldson likened The Bluetones to \"a Squeeze for the 90s\", and noted that the record has \"excellence exhibited throughout\". David Sinclair of Rolling Stone called the album \"an accomplished and varied collection of guitar-based tunes with a solid charm rooted in the best traditions of English alternative pop\u2014no more, but certainly no less.\" Melody Maker placed it at no. 19 on their list of 1996's Albums of the Year.
