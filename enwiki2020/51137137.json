    "text": "Calothrix crustacea is a species of cyanobacteria that is widespread in oceans worldwide. ==Anatomy== Unusually for bacteria, the filaments of this species have an elongated base and a pointed tip with transparent hair at the end. The filaments have coatings that are either firm or jelly-like, and they all are made up of concentric layers that are colored yellow or brown. The filament also grows like the root of a plant. Sometimes the filament sheds and can reproduce asexually by dropping fragments (hormogonia) off the stem. ==Habitats== This species of cyanobacteria frequently coat coastal rocks and seaweeds. This species may also form the photosynthetic part of certain rocky shore lichens, such as Lichina pygmaea. ==References== Category:Rivulariaceae Category:Bacteria described in 1886 ",
