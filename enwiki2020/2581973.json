The city lies along the Har\u015fit River, at an elevation of , about southwest of Trabzon. According to the 2010 census, population of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane urban center is 28,620.Statistical Institute The district covers an area of , and the city lies at an elevation of .

In Byzantine period, there was a town named Tzanicha or Tzantzakon ( in Byzantine Greek) means land of Zan / Laz people, possibly located to the west of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane.Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World: Map by Map directory, p.1237.Procopius of Caesarea, \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u039a\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, book C, 7. Around 840 AD, the area was included in the new Roman (Byzantine) province of Chaldia (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b4\u03af\u03b1). It was later ruled by the Byzantine Empire of Trebizond. During Ottoman years, the sanjak of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane fell under the administration successively Rum Province, Erzurum Province and Trabzon Province, and was divided into four kazas: G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, Torul (capital city Ardassa), \u015eiran (Cheriana), and Kelkit (Keltik). The sanjak in which G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane was situated at some stage comprised 37 mines of argentiferous lead and six copper mines. There is no evidence that these mines were in use during Byzantine times. As for the name of the city during the Ottoman period, Greek-speaking population was also using the name G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane (\u0393\u03ba\u03b9\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac and \u039a\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac) but, in the first decades of 19th century, the hellenized form Argyr\u00f3polis (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, from argyros \"silver\" and polis \"city\") was established.Terezakis Yorgos, Diocese of Chaldia (Ottoman Period), Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic world, Asia Minor. The Arghyropolis belonged to the Diocese of Chaldie (145 communities, 77,845 inhabitants). During the 1914-1918 Persecution of Greeks, the Turkish authorities boycott the Christians. The boycott deprived the Christians of all they possessed and reduced them to absolute poverty. The organizer of the boycott was the Djemal Azmi, Vali of Trebizonde, under whose orders were the Governor of Arghyropolis and others. In the sterile region of Argliyropolis the distress was great, because the inhabitants were entirely dependent for their existence on their local trade, and that from Russia. General mobilization was also among the causes conducive to the ruin of the Greek speaking communities, for the male inhabitants who supported their families were taken away from their homes. The Turkish officers treated the Greek speaking population in a brutal way, making many Greekophones to desert. This was the situation before the Russian advance. The Russian advance gave rise to a fresh outburst of fanaticism against the Greek element, the Turks from Turkish villages plundered the Christian villages of the region. During the Turkish retreat, the Turks pillaged many Greekophone villages of the region, the inhabitants took to the mountains and their property was plundered. Later on the retreat of the Russians, the Turks returned and the few inhabitants that remained in these villages, deprived of all resources and left to die of hunger. ==Geography== G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane is surrounded by high mountains, Zigana- Trabzon Mountains to the north, \u00c7imen Mountains to the south, Giresun Mountains to the west and Pulur, So\u011fanl\u0131 Mountains to the east. Trekking is popular sport is at these mountains. Mount Zigana has a ski center on it and it is a well known tourist destination for winter sports. Abdal Musa Peak (3331 m.) is the highest peak within it. The main trees in the forests are Scotch pine and fir, and there are many animals and birds in the area. There are many lakes such as Karanl\u0131k G\u00f6l, Be\u015f G\u00f6ller, Artebel G\u00f6l\u00fc, Kara G\u00f6ller which are at the peak of Gavurda\u011f\u0131 Mountain, and are preserved as natural parks. All these mountains compose 56% of the area of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane province. ===Climate=== G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Dsb on the border Dfb) with cold and snowy winters and warm summers. In the height of summer; July and August, temperatures at midday usually surpass 28 \u00b0C, summer nights tend to become very cool due to the high elevation of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, and in winter temperatures usually plummet to -10 \u00b0C and even go as low as -20 \u00b0C occasionally. ==Historic Sites : Architecture and Archaeology== Old G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane city, 1910s Ottoman era postcard G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane has a rich historical background so there are many historical places, mosques, churches, castles. The ancient city of Satala in the modern village of Sadak was the most important military camp of the ancient Roman Empire in the east. This place was ruled by the Colchians, Hittites, Assyrians, Urartu, Persians, Pontic Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. Today, rests of the Sadak village is protected by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. In addition, S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque is in the previous G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane settlement and it was commissioned by the Ottoman sultan S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Mosque and \u00c7it Village Mosque are some of other popular mosques in the city. Besides, there are numerous churches within G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. Santa \u00c7akall\u0131, Santa Terzili, Kalur Rock, Samamoni, and Theodor Churches are some examples of historical churches in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane.G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane (en) G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane historical places (tr) During the medieval period one of the most important guardians of the road connecting Trabzon to Erzincan was the Byzantine fortress located about northwest of modern G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. An archaeological and historical assessment of this site as well as a scaled plan were published in 1985.[13] The impressive circuit walls and defenses are clearly evident at the accessible west approach to the lofty outcrop. In addition to several rooms and cisterns, the castle has two chapels; the easternmost was once covered by a dome.Robert W. Edwards, \u201cThe Garrison Forts of the Pontos: A Case for the Diffusion of the Armenian Paradigm,\u201d Revue des \u00c9tudes Arm\u00e9niennes 19, 1985, pp.207-211, pls.39b-42b. ==Natural environment== Ecel Rocks in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane K\u00fcrt\u00fcn village in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane Mountains of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane There are numerous large and small caves which owe their formation to the geology - particularly the limestones - of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, including Alicli Agil Cave, Arili Cave, Alt\u0131nba\u015f\u0131 Cave, Asar\u00f6n\u00fc \u00d6ren Cave, Kartalkaya Cave, Ayiini Cave, K.Ardi\u00e7li Cave, Kar\u00e7ukuru Cave, Ardi\u00e7li Cave, Tepekli Cave, U\u00e7bacal\u0131 Cave, Buz Cave and Ikisu Cave.http://www.visiontours.com.au/index.php/tourism-and- travel/activities/caves/ Retrieved 25 April 2017. A distinctive local wildflower, bearing purple blossoms in Spring and frequently to be found growing in rock crevices around the mouths of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane's many caves, is a member of the nightshade genus Physochlaina : Physochlaina orientalis - a plant rich in medicinally valuable tropane alkaloids of the type found also in belladonna.Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands ed. Davis,P.H., pub. University of Edinburgh Press 1978, reprinted 1997, 2001 and 2008. The cave in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane most visited by tourists is the long Karaca Cave, popular because of its speleothems (= dripstone formations), including stalagmites, stalactites, columns and travertine pools. It is a fossil cave located between Torul and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, in which the lime-rich water percolating through fissures in the roof has slowly built up calcite structures of remarkable complexity. Other geological features of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane include the numerous plateaux commanding views of the forested areas which surround them. These include the Zigana, Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc, Artabel, \u015eiran and Kalis plateaux, which form fitting sites for the Summer festivals which are held there annually. ==Cuisine== Siron is a traditional dish in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane Many native tourists participate in these festivals - not only for entertainment's sake, but also to shop for regional delicacies. Pestil and k\u00f6me are renowned desserts of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, made from mulberries, honey, hazel nuts, walnuts and milk. In addition to k\u00f6me and pestil, rosehips, apples, and walnuts are notable local foods put to use in the many different desserts which are numbered among the regional specialities of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. Nor is the town's rich food culture restricted to sweetmeats : mant\u0131, lemis, eri\u015fte, borani, kuymak, evelek, dolmas\u0131 and siron feature among the savoury dishes local to G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane.Traditional food ==Ethnic groups== === Pontic Greek influence === The local residents of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane region were Laz people also called Chan (Tzan; by Georgians) i.e. Chald (Halt; by themselves). Just after the fall of Trebizond (1461) and the town soon became a home for miners. Sultan Murad \u0399\u0399\u0399 (1574\u20131595) appears to have granted extra privileges to the chief miners and the town prospered and soon became a centre of Hellenism. At the time, it had 60,000 residents. Its trade was increasing and the whole province of Chaldia was on the rise. Another example of its development was that they minted coins with the name Kioumous-hane on them. Another example was the settlement of chief mining families there such as the Sarasites, the Karatsades, the Stavracoglous, the Kalimachidises, the Grigorantons and others. There were also more jewellery shops opening, as well as more hagiography and other arts in the region. The rise in wealth and abundance soon brought positive changes to the communities. From the beginning of the 18th century new schools were opening, and from 1723 the Frontistirion (Greek Tuition Centre) of Argyropolis was in full operation. The tuition centre became an educational institution and spiritual centre of the region. In 1650 the diocese was elevated to archdiocese status, and hundreds of churches and temples were built. New mines rich in minerals were discovered in Ak-dag Maden and Argoni, which resulted in a large exodus of miners from Argyropolis to the new mines. The further dramatic fall in population followed the Russo-Turkish War of 1829\u201330, when many Greek speaking Pontians of the area collaborated with or welcomed the Russian army that occupied the area. So as to escape likely Turkish reprisals, the majority of the Greekophone Pontic population followed the Russian army as it withdrew back into Georgia and Southern Russia, many settling there and joining preexisting communities of Caucasus Greeks that had moved eastwards between the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461 and the 1801 Russian annexation of Georgia, including another community of Pontic Greekophone miners who had settled in Lore, then Kingdom of Kartli of Georgia in 1778 invited by the king Heraclius II of Georgia. Some of the Pontic Greekophone mining families of Gumu\u015fhane also settled in Nicomedia, Mesopotamia and other mining regions, from Tiflis (Tbilisi) to as far as Ak-Da\u011f and the Taurus. During those years tension between the Christian Greekophones and Muslim population was also growing due to the Greek Revolution and the public reversion to Greek Orthodoxy of many of the Stavriotes, Pontic Greekophones who had superficially adopted Turkish Islam in the early Ottoman period but who had remained crypto-Christian in private. Who were the crypto-Christians?, Crypto-Christians of the Trabzon Region of Pontos During those confusing and troubling times many people became benefactors of Argyropolis, such as the Sarasite family and the influential teacher Georgios Kyriakidis. Kyriakidis identified the need to extract large sums of money from the churches of Saint George, Saint Theodore, \u03a4\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd and \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 for the educational needs of the town. Sale of church property as well as donations and consecrations resulted in the erection of a new school at the Frontistirion of Argyropolis, a school which was to operate until the Exchange (1923). The Frontistirion comprised a three- grade high school, a seven-grade primary school including scholarship classes, and a six-grade girls' school, as well as a carpet-making technical school. Another public building was the library, the Educational Society Kyriakidis, as well as the Metropolis of Chaldia. The Argyropolitans therefore are very much regarded as having some of the best resources in education, due mainly to their economic rise as a result of mining.\u00d6zhan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Pontus: Antik \u00c7a\u011f\u2019dan G\u00fcn\u00fcm\u00fcze Karadeniz\u2019in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi Genesis Publishing. Ankara, 2011 pp. 695-701 After the turmoil and ethnic strife (1914\u20131923), a few ethnic Pontic Greeks managed to flee to Greece. They settled in the Macedonia region of Northern Greece. A small group which settled in Naousa brought precious items with them from their churches in town, as well as items from the library of the Frontistirion, including rare manuscripts and books. This collection is still in use today and is considered a prized asset of Naousa. The town was occupied by the Russian army on July 20, 1916, but the Russians withdrew on February 15, 1918, after the fall of the czar. After the exchange (1923) no Orthodox remained in the region. ==Economy== Historically, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane had mulberry tree plantations for sericulture. ==Notable natives== * Hasan Fehmi (Ata\u00e7) (1879, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane - 1961), Deputy during the Ottoman Empire and after declaration of republic first Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Finance of Turkey * Nihal Ats\u0131z (1905, \u0130stanbul - 1975), Prominent Turkish nationalist writer, born into a family from G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane * Bahriye \u00dc\u00e7ok (1919, Trabzon - 1990), Turkish academic of theology, left-wing politician and writer, born into Ata\u00e7 family of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane * Tar\u0131k Akan (1949, \u0130stanbul - 2016), Turkish film actor and producer, born into a family from G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane * Beren Saat (1984, Ankara - ), Turkish actress, born into a family from G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane * Turgay Erdener (1957, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane - ), Composer and teacher * Ayd\u0131n Do\u011fan (1936, Kelkit - ), Entrepreneur and businessmen * Mehmet Scholl (1970, Karlsruhe - ), German football manager and former player, born into a family from Torul * Hikmet Temel Akarsu (1960, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane - ), Turkish novelist, short-story writer, satirist and playwright * Yusuf G\u00fcney (1984, Trabzon - ), Turkish singer, born into a family from Kelkit * Arma\u011fan \u00c7a\u011flayan (1966, \u0130stanbul - ), Turkish television producer and lawyer, born into a family from G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane on his maternal side. * Saint George Karslidis (1901, Tsalka - 1959) Greek Elder * Georgios Kandilaptis (1881, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane - 1971), Greek scholar, journalist, teacher and writer * Ertu\u011frul Sa\u011flam (1969, Zonguldak - ), Turkish football manager and former player, born into a family from Torul * Ziya Do\u011fan (1961, K\u00f6se - ), Turkish football manager * Tolga Zengin (1983, Hopa - ), Turkish football goalkeeper, born into a family from Torul * Yunus Mall\u0131 (1992, Kaseel - ), Turkish footballer, born into a family from \u015eiran * Mithat Demirel (1978, Berlin - ), German former professional basketball player of Turkish descent. ==References== ==Literature== *The Encyclopedia of Pontian Hellenism.
