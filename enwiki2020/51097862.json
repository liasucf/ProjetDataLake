    "text": "Ilya Sutskever is a computer scientist working in machine learning and currently serving as the Chief scientist of OpenAI. He has made several major contributions to the field of deep learning. He is the co-inventor with Alexander Krizhevsky of AlexNet, a convolutional neural network. He invented Sequence to Sequence Learning, together with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le. Sutskever is also co-inventor of AlphaGo, and TensorFlow. ==Career== Sutskever attended the Open University of Israel between 2000 and 2002 later obtaining his B.Sc, M.Sc, and Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. After graduation in 2012, Sutskever spent two months as a postdoc with Andrew Ng at Stanford University. He then returned to University of Toronto and joined Hinton's new research company DNNResearch, a spinoff of Hinton's research group. Four months later, in March 2013, Google acquired DNNResearch and hired Sutskever as a research scientist at Google Brain. At Google Brain, Sutskever worked with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le to create the sequence to sequence learning algorithm. In 2015, Sutskever was named in MIT Technology Review's 35 Innovators Under 35. At the end of 2015 he left Google to become the director of newly founded OpenAI institute. Sutskever was the keynote speaker at NVIDIA NTECH 2018 and AI Frontiers Conference 2018. ==References== Category:Living people Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Machine learning researchers Category:Google employees Category:Canadian computer scientists Category:Artificial intelligence researchers Category:Canadian expatriates in the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
