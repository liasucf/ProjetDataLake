    "text": "This is a list of Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? episodes. The show ran for a total of four seasons from 1994-1999. The first three seasons ran their episodes weekly, while the fourth season had a season premiere in September 1996, a 1996 Halloween special, then a three-part episode that aired mid-1998, and the final four episodes airing late 1998 - early 1999. The episodes were aired out of their production order and intended broadcast order. As a result, episodes from one production season would sometimes air before all of the episodes from the previous season had aired, leaving the seasons without well- defined start or end dates, and using airdate alone to determine what season an episode belongs to is impossible. However, the seasons can be distinguished by their different intros and outros, and by their bookends around commercial breaks, and the order in which they appear on the DVD releases matches what is known about the production codes, implying that the DVD order is correct. == Season 1 (1994) == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Episode number and production !Production Code !Title !Storywriters !Release date !Description !Locations |- |1 |101 |The Stolen Smile |Kimmer Ringwald, Michael Konik, and Sean Roche |February 5, 1994 | Carmen steals parts of famous artworks to try to create her own personal masterpiece. |Amsterdam, Netherlands; Giza, Egypt; Paris, France; Lascaux Cave, France |- |2 |102 |A Higher Calling |Kimmer Ringwald and Sean Roche |February 12, 1994 | When Carmen steals Stonehenge, ACME detectives have to travel to England, Canada, Mexico, Easter Island and Australia in order to retrieve the stolen items. |Salisbury, England; Ellesmere Island; Palenque, Mexico; Easter Island; Ayers Rock, Australia |- |3 |103 |Dinosaur Delirium |Thomas Peroutka and David Ehrman |February 19, 1994 | Carmen steals four military helicopters and to India, Washington D.C., Indonesia.
