She made her solo singing debut with the digital single \"As You Are\" on January 17, 2020. She was the 2018 recipient of the Korea Image Flower Stone Award for her work on promoting Korea to the world. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Danilova was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She studied interior design at the Saint Petersburg State University of Industrial Technology and Design. ===Career=== In 2015, Danilova began a meteoric rise to fame when a Korean user reposted an image of her from 2014 to the Korean social networking site Naver with the caption \"Russian model who wants to marry a Korean man\". The post quickly went viral in Korea across all media platforms. In 2016, Palette Media scouted Danilova through her Instagram, and invited her to Korea as a main cast member for the reality survival show Babel 250, in which she lived with six other participants from across the globe and tried to establish friendships while breaking cultural and linguistic barriers. Since her appearance on the show, Danilova has met with success in Korean media and has appeared in over 10 television shows in the span of 3 years. She has featured in numerous modelling campaigns and music videos. In 2018, she appeared as Cinderella in the film New Old Story. She became the face of the Tale of Five Kingdoms, a mobile game developed by 4:33 Creative Lab, as well as a featured model of the cosmetics brand Banila Co., alongside Taeyeon from Girls' Generation. Danilova was featured in a 2016 music video for the song \"Eyescream\" by Hanhae. She later appeared in the music video for \"Heart pound (\ucff5\ucf85\ub300)\" by Eddy Kim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rQBIgavV1E and in \"\uc6b0\uc0ac\uc778\ubcfc\ud2b8 / Usain Bolt\" by Swings and Han Yo Han.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYNQ9HCCPrI On April 18, 2019, Danilova was a featured singer on Won Jang's second digital single, \"Sorry\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCMQuugfxSU On January 14, 2020, Angelina released a teaser clip on her Instagram to announce her debut as a singer.https://www.instagram.com/p/B7TW2mjgsau/ She made her debut with the ballad digital single \"As You Are\" on January 17, 2020.https://www.instagram.com/p/B7auOXCgOcU/ As of July 2020, Danilova has over 1 million followers on her Instagram page,https://www.instagram.com/angelinadanilova/ many of whom are not Korean. The influence Danilova wields in promoting Korean culture online has been a contributing factor in the spread of the Hallyu Wave throughout Western social media. The Corea Image Communication Institute (CICI), a nonprofit organization that promotes Korean culture abroad, awarded Danilova as the 2018 recipient of the Korea Image Flower Stone Award for her work promoting Korea to the world. Fellow recipients that day included Sohn Kyung-shik, chairman of CJ Group, the food and media conglomerate, and Joachim Son-Forget, the first Korean-born member of the French National Assembly. Past award winners of CICI Korea Image Awards include K-pop stars Psy and Rain, maestro Chung Myung-whun, and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. === Personal life === Danilova's interest in Korean culture began when she watched a video from Fine Brothers Entertainment titled \"YouTubers React to K-pop\". She uploads videos to her YouTube channel (currently amassing more than 200K subscribers). Her videos mainly consist of vlogs, makeup tutorials and song covers. Danilova speaks five languages; Russian, English, Serbian, Korean and Italian. Danilova is frequently called \"elf\" or \"goddess\" by her Korean fans, but in a 2016 Instagram post she spoke out against being seen only for her appearance, writing: \"Don't call me beautiful, I don't care. Call me intelligent. Tell me my laugh is contagious. Tell me I have something.\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHSGIFgg6k3/ She has stated her hobbies include: dancing, singing, playing ukulele, listening to music, fashion, traveling, horse riding, snowboarding, kite surfing, drawing and filming videos. One of her artistic aspirations is music composition. == Controversy == In 2018, Danilova left Palette Media and joined her current agency the Prizm Entertainment. Palette Media accused her of fraud, and filed a complaint with the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office against Danilova, accusing her of failing to fulfil her contractual obligations and entering into a contract with another agency without Palette Media's agreement. Palette Media claimed it made an exclusive three-year (2016-2019) contract with Danilova, who rose to fame on social media as \"the most beautiful K-pop fan\". Palette Media alleged that she took part in promotional events and received sponsorship on several occasions without the agency's permission. Separately, the agency said it has filed a damages suit against her for her \"illegal commercial activities.\" The Prizm Entertainment pointed out that Pallete did not have the basic qualifications to operate as an entertainment company, and had problems such as unwillingness to share contract details, unclear payment details, and insufficient management support.https://namu.wiki/w/ ==Filmography== === Movie === {| class = \"wikitable\" style = \"text-align: center;\" ! year ! title ! role !
