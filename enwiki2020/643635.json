    "text": "Gyachung Kang (, Gy\u0101chung K\u0101ng; ) is a mountain in the Mahalangur Himal section of the Himalayas, and is the highest peak between Cho Oyu (8,201 m) and Mount Everest (8,848 m). It lies on the border between Nepal and China. As the fifteenth-highest peak in the world, it is also the highest peak that is not eight thousand metres tall; hence it is far less well-known than the lowest of the eight-thousanders, which are only about higher. The peak's lack of significant prominence (700 m) also contributes to its relative obscurity. == Climbing history == The mountain was first climbed on April 10, 1964 by Y. Kato, K. Sakaizawa and Pasang Phutar, and on the next day by K. Machida and K. Yasuhisa. The north face was first climbed in 1999 by a Slovene expedition and was repeated by Yasushi Yamanoi in 2002. ==View== ==References== ==External links== * Slovene Gyachung Kang '99 Expedition at MountainZone.com * Costly success on Gyachung Kang * Report on the first ascent 1964 by Yukihiko Kato * Gyachung Kang Virtual Aerial Video Category:Mountains of Nepal Category:Mountains of the Tibet Autonomous Region Category:China\u2013Nepal border Category:International mountains of Asia Category:Seven-thousanders of the Himalayas Category:Mountains of the Province No. 1 ",
