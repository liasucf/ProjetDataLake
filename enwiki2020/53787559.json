    "text": "The Revue historique is a French academic journal founded in 1876 by the Protestant Gabriel Monod and the Catholic Gustave Fagniez. The journal was founded as a reaction against the Revue des questions historiques created ten years earlier by Ultramontanists and Legitimists. The Revue historique has been published quarterly since 1937.Revue historique, National Library of Australia The founders of the Revue historique stated that the journal was not intended to promote any particular religion, party, or doctrine.Guy Bourd\u00e9 et Herv\u00e9 Martin, Les \u00c9coles historiques, \u00c9ditions du Seuil 1983 p.182-188 Most of its contributors came from Protestant or free thinker circles. Fagniez resigned in 1881 to protest the attacks of the Revue against the Catholic Church. Charles B\u00e9mont was an editor for the Revue from 1876 and served as a co-director until 1939. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Revue's contributors included Charles Bayet, Arthur Giry, Camille Jullian, Gustave Bloch, Ernest Lavisse, Paul Guiraud and Ernest Havet. The Revue originated the historical method known as l'\u00c9cole m\u00e9thodique, which is particularly associated with the names of Charles-Victor Langlois et Charles Seignobos. Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond was Honorary Director until his death in 2007, as was Jean Favier who succeeded him as Honorary Director until his death in 2014. S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty and Pierre Renouvin were directors before WWII. Renouvin was the sole director for a long period after WWII. In 1967 he was a co- director with Georges Duby and also Maurice Crouzet, who had been the editor- in-chief since 1929. ==References== == External links == * La Revue historique sur le site des Presses universitaires de France * Ann\u00e9es 1876 \u00e0 2000 de la Revue historique, available online via Gallica * * Category:1876 establishments in France Category:French-language journals Category:History journals Category:Publications established in 1876 ",
