    "text": "Alpes Maritimae () was a province of the Roman Empire. It was one of the three provinces straddling the Alps between modern France and Italy, along with Alpes Poeninae and Alpes Cottiae. The province included parts of the present- day French departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes- Alpes. == History == Founded in 14 BC by Augustus, Alpes Maritimae initially had its capital at Cemenelum (modern Cimiez), currently a neighbourhood within the city of Nice, France. In 297, the province was extended to the north and north-west as far as the River Durance (Druentia) and the Montgen\u00e8vre Pass. Its capital was transferred to Civitas Ebrodunensium, known today as Embrun. In the 3rd century the province became part of the Diocese of Vienne, which was in turn part of the Prefecture of Gaul. == Settlements == Major settlements within the province included: * Cemenelum (Cimiez) * Nicaea (Nice) * Antipolis (Antibes) * Portus Herculis Monoeci (Monaco) * Salinae (Castellane) * Sanitium (Senez) * Vintium (Vence) After 297 the province was expanded to include: * Ebrodunum (Embrun) * Brigantio (Brian\u00e7on) * Brigomagus (Brian\u00e7onnet) * Civitas Rigomagensium / Rigomagus (Chorges) == References == Category:Provinces of the Roman Empire Category:Tres Alpes Category:States and territories established in the 1st century BC Category:14 BC establishments Category:10s BC establishments in the Roman Empire Category:476 disestablishments Category:470s disestablishments in the Roman Empire ",
