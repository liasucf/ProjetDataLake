    "text": "Philippine Mathilde Camille, Baroness de Rothschild (22 November 1933 \u2013 23 August 2014)Philippe de Rothschild, Milady Vine, London: Jonathan Cape, 1984, page 107 was the owner of the French winery Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. She acted under the stage name Philippine Pascale. She was the only daughter of the vintner Baron Philippe de Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild banking dynasty. ==Biography== Rothschild was born in Paris, France. At the time of her birth, her mother, Elisabeth Pelletier de Chambure, a French Catholic aristocrat, was not married to her father Philippe de Rothschild, but instead married to Jonkheer Marc de Becker-R\u00e9my, a Belgian nobleman. After a legal skirmish and the Jonkheer's threats to kidnap his wife's child, the Becker- R\u00e9mys divorced in 1934. Shortly afterwards, Rothschild's mother and father eventually married that same year in Paris. By 1939, Philippe de Rothschild separated from Elisabeth, who reverted to using her maiden name. Rothschild had one brother, Charles Henri de Rothschild, who was born in 1938 and died that same year. When Philippine de Rothschild was ten years old, she witnessed the Gestapo arrest her mother, who later died at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp, the only known member of the Rothschild family to die during The Holocaust. In 1958, she graduated from the Paris Conservatoire National d'Art Dramatique and acted in La Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise with Catherine Deneuve. She played one of the leading roles in Harold and Maude with Madeleine Renaud between 1973 and 1980. She was made an Officier of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 2007, and in 2013 was given a lifetime achievement award by the Institute of Masters of Wine. ==Work in the wine business== Rothschild entered her father's wine business in the late 1970s. When Philippe died in 1988, Philippine inherited three estates in Bordeaux: Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild (bought by her great-great grandfather Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1853), Ch\u00e2teau d'Armailhac, and Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon. She also became chairwoman and majority owner of Baron Philippe de Rothschild S.A. At the time of her father's death, the company sold 1.3 million cases of wine a year. By 2000, sales had almost doubled to 2.1 million cases. In 1999, sales amounted to around $155 million (approximately $ million in dollars).
