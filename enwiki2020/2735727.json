    "text": "In mathematics, the Fr\u00e9chet derivative is a derivative defined on Banach spaces. Named after Maurice Fr\u00e9chet, it is commonly used to generalize the derivative of a real-valued function of a single real variable to the case of a vector-valued function of multiple real variables, and to define the functional derivative used widely in the calculus of variations. Generally, it extends the idea of the derivative from real-valued functions of one real variable to functions on Banach spaces. The Fr\u00e9chet derivative should be contrasted to the more general Gateaux derivative which is a generalization of the classical directional derivative. The Fr\u00e9chet derivative has applications to nonlinear problems throughout mathematical analysis and physical sciences, particularly to the calculus of variations and much of nonlinear analysis and nonlinear functional analysis. == Definition == Let V and W be normed vector spaces, and U\\subset V be an open subset of V. A function f : U \u2192 W is called Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at x \\in U if there exists a bounded linear operator A:V\\to W such that :\\lim_{\\|h\\| \\to 0} \\frac{ \\| f(x + h) - f(x) - Ah \\|_{W} }{ \\|h\\|_{V} } = 0. The limit here is meant in the usual sense of a limit of a function defined on a metric space (see Functions on metric spaces), using V and W as the two metric spaces, and the above expression as the function of argument h in V. As a consequence, it must exist for all sequences \\langle h_n\\rangle_{n=1}^{\\infty} of non-zero elements of V that converge to the zero vector h_n \\to 0. Equivalently, the first-order expansion holds, in Landau notation : f(x + h) = f(x) + Ah +o(h). If there exists such an operator A, it is unique, so we write Df(x)=A and call it the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of f at x. A function f that is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable for any point of U is said to be C1 if the function :Df:U\\to B(V,W) ; x \\mapsto Df(x) is continuous (B(V,W) denotes the space of all bounded linear operators from V to W). Note that this is not the same as requiring that the map Df(x) : V \\to W be continuous for each value of x (which is assumed; bounded and continuous are equivalent). This notion of derivative is a generalization of the ordinary derivative of a function on the real numbers f:\\R\\to\\R since the linear maps from \\R to \\R are just multiplication by a real number. In this case, Df(x) is the function t \\mapsto f'(x)t . == Properties == A function differentiable at a point is continuous at that point. Differentiation is a linear operation in the following sense: if f and g are two maps V \u2192 W which are differentiable at x, and r and s are scalars (two real or complex numbers), then rf + sg is differentiable at x with D(rf + sg)(x) = rDf(x) + sDg(x). The chain rule is also valid in this context: if f : U \u2192 Y is differentiable at x in U, and g : Y \u2192 W is differentiable at y = f(x), then the composition g o f is differentiable in x and the derivative is the composition of the derivatives: :D(g \\circ f)(x) = Dg(f(x))\\circ Df(x). == Finite dimensions == The Fr\u00e9chet derivative in finite-dimensional spaces is the usual derivative. In particular, it is represented in coordinates by the Jacobian matrix. Suppose that f is a map, f:U\\sub\\R^n\\to\\R^m with U an open set. If f is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at a point a \u2208 U, then its derivative is :\\begin{cases} Df(a): \\R^n \\to \\R^m \\\\\\ Df(a)(v) = J_f(a) v \\end{cases} where Jf(a) denotes the Jacobian matrix of f at a. Furthermore, the partial derivatives of f are given by : \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a) = Df(a)(e_i) = J_f(a) e_i, where {ei} is the canonical basis of \\R^n. Since the derivative is a linear function, we have for all vectors h \\in \\R^n that the directional derivative of f along h is given by : Df(a)(h) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a). If all partial derivatives of f exist and are continuous, then f is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable (and, in fact, C1). The converse is not true; the function : f(x, y)= \\begin{cases} (x^2+y^2)\\sin \\left ((x^2+y^2)^{-1/2} \\right ) & (x, y) e (0, 0)\\\\\\ 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\end{cases} is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable and yet fails to have continuous partial derivatives at (0,0). == Example in infinite dimensions == One of the simplest (nontrivial) examples in infinite dimensions, is the one where the domain is a Hilbert space (H) and the function in interest is the norm. So consider \\|\\cdot\\|:H\\to\\mathbb{R}. First assume that x e 0. Then we claim that the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of \\|\\cdot\\| at x is the linear functional D, defined by :Dv:=\\left\\langle v,\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}\\right\\rangle. Indeed, :\\begin{align} \\frac{|\\|x+h\\|-\\|x\\|-Dh|}{\\|h\\|} &=\\frac{|\\|x\\|\\|x+h\\|-\\langle x,x\\rangle-\\langle x,h\\rangle|}{\\|x\\|\\|h\\|} \\\\\\\\[8pt] &=\\frac{|\\|x\\|\\|x+h\\|-\\langle x,x+h\\rangle|}{\\|x\\|\\|h\\|} \\\\\\\\[8pt] &=\\frac{|\\langle x,x\\rangle \\langle x+h,x+h\\rangle-\\langle x,x+h\\rangle^2|}{\\|x\\|\\|h\\|(|\\|x\\|\\|x+h\\|+\\langle x,x+h\\rangle|)} \\\\\\\\[8pt] &=\\frac{\\langle x,x \\rangle \\langle h,h \\rangle-\\langle x,h \\rangle^2}{\\|x\\|\\|h\\|(|\\|x\\|\\|x+h\\|+\\langle x,x+h\\rangle|)} \\\\\\ &{} \\end{align} Using continuity of the norm and inner product we obtain: :\\begin{align} \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{|\\|x+h\\|-\\|x\\|-Dh|}{\\|h\\|} &= \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\langle x,x \\rangle \\langle h,h \\rangle-\\langle x,h \\rangle^2}{\\|x\\|\\|h\\|(|\\|x\\|\\|x+h\\|+\\langle x,x+h\\rangle|)} \\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{1}{2\\|x\\|^3}\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\langle x,x \\rangle \\langle h,h \\rangle-\\langle x,h \\rangle^2}{\\|h\\|} \\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{1}{2\\|x\\|^3}\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\left(\\langle x,x\\rangle\\|h\\|-\\langle x,h\\rangle \\left\\langle x,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle\\right) \\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{1}{2\\|x\\|^3}\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\langle x,x\\rangle\\|h\\|-\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\langle x,h\\rangle \\left\\langle x,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle \\right ) \\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\frac{1}{2\\|x\\|^3}\\left(0-\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\langle x,h\\rangle \\left\\langle x,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle \\right ) \\\\\\\\[8pt] &= -\\frac{1}{2\\|x\\|^3}\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\langle x,h\\rangle \\left\\langle x,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle \\right ) \\\\\\\\[8pt] \\end{align} As h\\to 0, \\langle x,h\\rangle \\to 0 and because of the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality :\\left\\langle x,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle is bounded by \\|x\\| thus the whole limit vanishes. Now we show that at x=0 the norm is not differentiable, i.e. there does not exist bounded linear functional D such that the limit in question to be 0. Let D be any linear functional. Riesz representation theorem tells us that D could be defined by Dv=\\langle a,v\\rangle for some a\\in H. Consider :A(h)=\\frac{|\\|0+h\\|-\\|0\\|-Dh|}{\\|h\\|}=\\left|1-\\left\\langle a,\\frac{h}{\\|h\\|}\\right\\rangle\\right|. In order for the norm to be differentiable at 0 we must have :\\lim_{h\\to 0}A(h)=0. We will show that this is not true for any a. If a=0 obviously A(h)=1 independently of h, hence this is not the derivative. Assume a e 0. If we take h tending to zero in the direction of -a (i.e. h=t\\cdot(-a), where t \\to 0 ^{+}) then A(h)=|1+\\|a\\||>1>0, hence :\\lim_{h\\to 0} A(h) e 0 (If we take h tending to zero in the direction of a we would even see this limit does not exist since in this case we will obtain |1-\\|a\\||). The result just obtained agrees with the results in finite dimensions. == Relation to the Gateaux derivative == A function f : U \u2282 V \u2192 W is called Gateaux differentiable at x \u2208 U if f has a directional derivative along all directions at x. This means that there exists a function such that :g(h)=\\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{ f(x + th) - f(x) }{ t } for any chosen vector h in V, and where t is from the scalar field associated with V (usually, t is real).It is common to include in the definition that the resulting map g must be a continuous linear operator. We avoid adopting this convention here to allow examination of the widest possible class of pathologies. If f is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at x, it is also Gateaux differentiable there, and g is just the linear operator A = Df(x). However, not every Gateaux differentiable function is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable. This is analogous to the fact that the existence of all directional derivatives at a point does not guarantee total differentiability (or even continuity) at that point. For example, the real-valued function f of two real variables defined by :f(x, y)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{x^3}{x^2+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0)\\\\\\ 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\end{cases} is continuous and Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative being :g(a, b)=\\begin{cases} \\frac{a^3}{a^2+b^2}& (a, b) e (0, 0)\\\\\\ 0 & (a, b)=(0, 0) \\end{cases} The function g is not a linear operator, so this function is not Fr\u00e9chet differentiable. More generally, any function of the form f(x,y) = g (r) h (\\phi), where r and \u03c6 are the polar coordinates of (x,y), is continuous and Gateaux differentiable at (0,0) if g is differentiable at 0 and h(\\phi + \\pi) = -h(\\phi), but the Gateaux derivative is only linear and the Fr\u00e9chet derivative only exists if h is sinusoidal. In another situation, the function f given by :f(x, y)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{x^3y}{x^6+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0)\\\\\\ 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\end{cases} is Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative there being g(a, b) = 0 for all (a, b), which is a linear operator. However, f is not continuous at (0, 0) (one can see by approaching the origin along the curve (t, t3)) and therefore f cannot be Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at the origin. A more subtle example is :f(x, y)= \\begin{cases} \\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} & (x, y) e (0, 0)\\\\\\ 0 & (x, y)=(0, 0) \\end{cases} which is a continuous function that is Gateaux differentiable at (0, 0), with its derivative being g(a, b) = 0 there, which is again linear. However, f is not Fr\u00e9chet differentiable. If it were, its Fr\u00e9chet derivative would coincide with its Gateaux derivative, and hence would be the zero operator; hence the limit :\\lim_{(x,y)\\to(0,0)}\\left|\\frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}\\right| would have to be zero, whereas approaching the origin along the curve (t, t2) shows that this limit does not exist. These cases can occur because the definition of the Gateaux derivative only requires that the difference quotients converge along each direction individually, without making requirements about the rates of convergence for different directions. Thus, for a given \u03b5, although for each direction the difference quotient is within \u03b5 of its limit in some neighborhood of the given point, these neighborhoods may be different for different directions, and there may be a sequence of directions for which these neighborhoods become arbitrarily small. If a sequence of points is chosen along these directions, the quotient in the definition of the Fr\u00e9chet derivative, which considers all directions at once, may not converge. Thus, in order for a linear Gateaux derivative to imply the existence of the Fr\u00e9chet derivative, the difference quotients have to converge uniformly for all directions. The following example only works in infinite dimensions. Let X be a Banach space, and \u03c6 a linear functional on X that is discontinuous at x = 0 (a discontinuous linear functional). Let :f(x) = \\|x\\|\\varphi(x). Then f(x) is Gateaux differentiable at x = 0 with derivative 0\\. However, f(x) is not Fr\u00e9chet differentiable since the limit :\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\varphi(x) does not exist. == Higher derivatives == If is a differentiable function at all points in an open subset U of V, it follows that its derivative :D f : U \\to L(V, W) is a function from U to the space of all bounded linear operators from V to W. This function may also have a derivative, the second order derivative of f, which, by the definition of derivative, will be a map :D^2 f : U \\to L\\big(V, L(V, W)\\big). To make it easier to work with second-order derivatives, the space on the right-hand side is identified with the Banach space of all continuous bilinear maps from V to W. An element \u03c6 in is thus identified with \u03c8 in such that for all x and y in V, :\\varphi(x)(y)=\\psi(x, y). (Intuitively: a function \u03c6 linear in x with \u03c6(x) linear in y is the same as a bilinear function \u03c8 in x and y). One may differentiate :D^2 f : U \\to L^2(V\\times V, W) again, to obtain the third order derivative, which at each point will be a trilinear map, and so on. The n-th derivative will be a function :D^n f : U \\to L^n(V\\times V\\times \\cdots \\times V, W), taking values in the Banach space of continuous multilinear maps in n arguments from V to W. Recursively, a function f is times differentiable on U if it is n times differentiable on U and for each x in U there exists a continuous multilinear map A of arguments such that the limit :\\lim_{h_{n+1} \\to 0} \\frac{ \\left \\| D^nf \\left(x + h_{n+1} \\right )(h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n) - D^nf(x)(h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n) - A \\left (h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n, h_{n+1} \\right ) \\right \\| }{ \\|h_{n+1}\\| } = 0 exists uniformly for h1, h2, ..., hn in bounded sets in V. In that case, A is the st derivative of f at x. Moreover, we may obviously identify a member of the space L^n(V\\times V\\times \\cdots \\times V, W) with a linear map L(\\bigotimes_{j=1}^n V_j, W) through the identification f(x_1,x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = f(x_1 \\otimes x_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x_n) , thus viewing the derivative as a linear map. == Partial Fr\u00e9chet derivatives == In this section, we extend the usual notion of partial derivatives which is defined for functions of the form f: \\R^n \\to \\R , to functions whose domains and target spaces are arbitrary (real or complex) Banach spaces. To do this, let V_1, \\dots, V_n and W be Banach spaces (over the same field of scalars), and let f: \\prod_{i=1}^n V_i \\to W be a given function, and fix a point a = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in \\prod_{i=1}^n V_i . We say that f has an i-th partial differential at the point a if the function \\varphi_i : V_i \\to W defined by : \\varphi_i(x) = f(a_1, \\dots, a_{i-1}, x, a_{i+1}, \\dots a_n) is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at the point a_i (in the sense described above). In this case, we define \\partial_if(a) := D\\varphi_i(a_i) , and we call \\partial_if(a) the i-th partial derivative of f at the point a . It is important to note that \\partial_if(a) is a linear transformation from V_i into W . Heuristically, if f has an i-th partial differential at a , then \\partial_if(a) linearly approximates the change in the function f when we fix all of its entries to be a_j for j eq i , and we only vary the i-th entry. We can express this in the Landau notation as : f(a_1, \\dots, a_i+h, \\dots a_n) - f(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = \\partial_if(a)(h) + o(h). == Generalization to topological vector spaces == The notion of the Fr\u00e9chet derivative can be generalized to arbitrary topological vector spaces (TVS) X and Y. Letting U be an open subset of X that contains the origin and given a function f: U \\to Y such that f(0) = 0, we first define what it means for this function to have 0 as its derivative. We say that this function f is tangent to 0 if for every open neighborhood of 0, W \\sub Y there exists an open neighborhood of 0, V\\sub X and a function o: \\R \\to \\R such that :\\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{o(t)}{t} = 0, and for all t in some neighborhood of the origin, f(tV) \\sub o(t) W. We can now remove the constraint that f(0) = 0 by defining f to be Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at a point x_0 \\in U if there exists a continuous linear operator \\lambda : X \\to Y such that f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0) - \\lambda h, considered as a function of h, is tangent to 0. (Lang p. 6) If the Fr\u00e9chet derivative exists then it is unique. Furthermore, the Gateaux derivative must also exist and be equal the Fr\u00e9chet derivative in that for all v \\in X, : \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0}\\frac{f(x_0 + \\tau v) - f(x_0)}{\\tau} = f'(x_0) v, where f'(x_0) is the Fr\u00e9chet derivative. A function that is Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at a point is necessarily continuous there and sums and scalar multiples of Fr\u00e9chet differentiable functions are differentiable so that the space of functions that are Fr\u00e9chet differentiable at a point form a subspace of the functions that are continuous at that point. The chain rule also holds as does the Leibniz rule whenever Y is an algebra and a TVS in which multiplication is continuous. == See also == * Generalizations of the derivative * Infinite-dimensional holomorphy == Notes == == References == *. *. *. *. *. *. == External links == * B.
