This character may carry over to beers brewed with the smoked malt. Prior to the modern era, drying malted barley in direct sunlight was used in addition to drying over flames. Even though kiln drying of malt, using indirect heat, did not enter into widespread usage until the industrial era, the method was known as early as the first century BC. Also, there have been various methods over the years of preparing cereal grains for brewing, including making beer from bread, so smoked beer was not universal. Beginning in the 18th century, kiln drying of malt became progressively more common and, by the mid-19th century, had become the near-universal method for drying malted grain. Since the kiln method shunts the smoke away from the wet malt, a smoky flavour is not imparted to the grain, nor to the subsequent beer. As a result, smoke flavour in beer became less and less common, and eventually disappeared almost entirely from the brewing world. ==Bamberg Rauchbier== Bamberg smoked beers Certain breweries maintained the smoked beer tradition by continuing to use malt which had been dried over open flames. Two brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany-- Schlenkerla and Spezial--have continued smoked beer production for centuries. Both are still in operation today, alongside seven other breweries in the same town. Both dry their malt over fires made from beechwood logs, and produce several varieties of Rauchbier (\"smoke beer\" in German). And since the Rauchbier tradition was preserved only in Bamberg continuously, the beer style is also often referred to as \"Bamberg Rauchbier (smokebeer)\" or \"Bamberg style smoked beer\". Due to the craft beer revolution in recent years, industrially made, smoke-flavored malts became available, and so the style has a renaissance worldwide and even in its heartland Franconia and Bamberg. The traditional, elaborate way of smoke malting, however, as only Schlenkerla and Spezial are doing it, thereby becomes even rarer. Therefore in 2017 SlowFood enlisted those two last remaining traditional Rauchbiers into their Ark of Taste. ==Smoked beers outside Germany== In Australia, the Feral Brewing Company, in Western Australia, makes a smoked porter.
