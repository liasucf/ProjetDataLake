    "text": "Guy Allen (born September 5, 1958) is a ProRodeo Hall of Fame cowboy and an 18-time World Steer Roping Champion. He competes in rodeos sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). He won the world title for the steer roping event 18 times when competing at the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) and also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Average title five times. He had won the title 11 times in a row when Buster Record broke his streak. Allen is also inducted into seven rodeo halls of fame. == Early life == Guy Allen was born on September 5, 1958, in Coushatta, Louisiana, to a ranching family. He graduated from Santa Anna High School. He started rodeo in 1961. His father and brother are also PRCA members and the three all qualified together for the NFSR in 1983, the first time a father and two sons had qualified for the event at the same time. == Career == Allen competes on the PRCA rodeo circuit. He most recently competed in 2016. At age 7, Allen traveled to rodeos with his father to compete. At age 13, he had become an adept steer roper. In 1976, at age 16, he joined the PRCA. He filled his permit within a month of joining. \"Filling a permit\" is when a contestant fulfills the requirements to become a PRCA card holder, which includes purchasing a permit and earning a minimum dollar amount at sanctioned rodeos. As a card holder, a contestant is allowed to compete in finals events and gain official ranking. At age 19, he competed in his first NFSR and won his first world title. He also competes in team roping. In 2000, in Duncan, Oklahoma, Allen set a new world record for the fastest steer roping time at 7.9 seconds. He held the record until 2012 when, on June 2, Cody Scheck set a new world record with a 7.7-second run at the Old Fort Days Rodeo in Fort Smith, Arkansas. A steer roper by the name of Buster Record had been trying to win his first world record for ten years and break Allen's consecutive record streak. Allen had reached a streak of 11 straight titles by that time approaching the 2002 NFSR. Record finished the regular season ahead of Allen by $205, which had not been achieved in 13 years. Record ended Allen's world title streak at 11 consecutive titles with an all out performance at the 2002 NFSR. Record's winning earnings at the NFSR at the Amarillo National Center in Amarillo, Texas, were $56,575. He was well ahead of Trevor Brazile who earned $47,871 for No. 2 and Allen at No. 3 with $47,789. In 1959, Jim Shoulders set a record of 16 world championships. This record stood until Allen matched the record in 2001 after winning his 16th steer roping title. Two years later in 2003, Allen broke Shoulder's record after winning a 17th title. He won his 18th and final title to date in 2004. In 2013, Trevor Brazile won another all- around title and his total number of world titles moved to 19 world titles. This broke Allen's record of 18 world titles. As of 2019, Brazile has 25 world titles, seven more than Allen, who is in second place with 18 titles, and Shoulders is in third place with 16 titles. === Summary === Allen won the world title for the steer roping event 18 times in 1977, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1991\u20132001, and 2003, 2004 when competing at the NFSR at each season's end.Wrangler NFR Records, History, Past World Champions by Event, p. 302.
