Brown went into sports broadcasting in 1984 when he was offered a job doing Washington Bullets television broadcasts as well as an analyst job for The NBA on CBS, paired with Frank Glieber. He later moved on to an anchor position at WDVM-TV (later WUSA) in Washington and to some work at CBS Sports. Brown was rehired by CBS Sports in 1987, where he served as play-by-play announcer for the network's NFL and college basketball coverage, as well as reporter for the NBA Finals (calling games with Tom Heinsohn during the 1990 NBA Playoffs) and the 1990 National League Championship Series.

But, there was still a distinct emptiness in my life, and I remember riding home one lonely night early in the morning and asking the Lord to come back into my life. I knew that was the reason for the void and that I would endeavor with His help [and] the help of the Holy Spirit to walk upright and faithful before Him. It\u2019s been wonderful. \u2026 I know in my own life, there have been abundant examples that have proven that there is only one name that counts out there. One name that all the demons in hell flee from and that every knee must bow, and that\u2019s the name of Jesus Christ. You can try a number of different systems and philosophies to be successful in life, and you\u2019ll enjoy short-term success. But, there is a genuine peace in the innermost recesses of your personality that only come from knowing Jesus Christ.\" On May 3, , Brown became a minority owner of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team. Brown was one of a handful of investors in the group led by Washington, D.C. real estate developer Ted Lerner. ==References== ;Notes ==External links== *Jaffe, Harry. \"James Brown: Making Mama Proud\", Washingtonian, December 1, 2008. *Lerner Picked as Nationals New Owner *Issue 44 -- Television Sportscasters (African-American) *Fox's Brown Will Leave to Be CBS's N.F.L.
