    "text": "The Scottish Union of Dock Labourers was a Glasgow-based trade union for waterfront workers. It was formed during the seamen's and dockers' strikes of June\u2013July 1911. Locally, it replaced the National Union of Dock Labourers, which had been formed in Glasgow in 1889 but later became unpopular in that port, finally closing its local branch in February 1910. The president of the SUDL throughout its lifetime was Joe Houghton. The union joined the Transport & General Workers' Union in 1922, but many of its members left in 1932 to form the Scottish Transport and General Workers' Union (Docks). ==See also== * Transport and General Workers' Union * TGWU amalgamations ==Further reading== * William Kenefick, Rebellious and Contrary: The Glasgow Dockers, 1853-1932 (Scottish Historical Review Monograph No. 10., East Linton, Tuckwell Press, 2000 Category:Economic history of Scotland Category:Defunct trade unions of Scotland Category:Organisations based in Glasgow Category:Port workers' trade unions Category:Water transport in the United Kingdom Category:Water transport in Scotland Category:1911 establishments in Scotland Category:Transport and General Workers' Union amalgamations Category:Trade unions established in 1911 Category:Trade unions disestablished in 1922 ",
