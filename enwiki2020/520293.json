    "text": "CISSP logo CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is an independent information security certification granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, also known as (ISC)\u00b2. As of July 1, 2020 there are 141,607 (ISC)\u00b2 members holding the CISSP certification worldwide, a fall of just over 500 since the start of the year. In , the CISSP designation was accredited under the ANSI ISO/IEC Standard 17024:2003.ANSI Accreditation Services - International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, Inc. (ISC)2 . ANSI It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in their Information Assurance Technical (IAT), Managerial (IAM), and System Architect and Engineer (IASAE) categories for their DoDD 8570 certification requirement. In May 2020, The UK National Recognition Information Centre (UK NARIC - the designated United Kingdom national agency for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and skills, acting on behalf of the UK Government) assessed the CISSP qualification as a Level 7 award, confirming the certification is comparable to Masters degree standard. The change will enable cyber security professionals to use the CISSP certification towards higher education course credit. == History == In the mid-1980s, a need arose for a standardized, vendor-neutral certification program that provided structure and demonstrated competence. In November 1988, the Special Interest Group for Computer Security (SIG-CS), a member of the Data Processing Management Association (DPMA), brought together several organizations interested in this goal. The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium or \"(ISC)\u00b2\" formed in mid-1989 as a non-profit organization. By 1990, the first working committee to establish a Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) had been formed. The first version of the CBK was finalized by 1992, and the CISSP credential was launched by 1994.History of (ISC)\u00b2. (ISC)\u00b2 In 2003 the CISSP was adopted as a baseline for the U.S. National Security Agency's ISSEP program. == Certification subject matter == The CISSP curriculum breaks the subject matter down into a variety of Information Security topics referred to as domains. The CISSP examination is based on what (ISC)\u00b2 terms the Common Body of Knowledge (or CBK). According to (ISC)\u00b2, \"the CISSP CBK is a taxonomy \u2013 a collection of topics relevant to information security professionals around the world. The CISSP CBK establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles that allow information security professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding.\" From 15 April 2018, the eight domains covered are : #Security and Risk Management #Asset Security #Security Architecture and Engineering #Communication and Network Security #Identity and Access Management #Security Assessment and Testing #Security Operations #Software Development Security From 2015 to early 2018, the CISSP curriculum is divided into eight domains similar to the latest curriculum above. The only domain to have changed its name was \"Security Engineering,\" which in the 2018 revision was expanded to \"Security Architecture and Engineering.\" Before 2015, it covered ten domains : # Operations security # Telecommunications and network security # Information security governance and risk management # Software development security # Cryptography # Security architecture and design # Access control # Business continuity and disaster recovery planning # Legal, regulations, investigations and compliance # Physical (environmental) security == Requirements == * Possess a minimum of five years of direct full-time security work experience in two or more of the (ISC)\u00b2 information security domains (CBK). One year may be waived for having either a four-year college degree, a master's degree in Information Security, or for possessing one of a number of other certifications. A candidate without the five years of experience may earn the Associate of (ISC)\u00b2 designation by passing the required CISSP examination, valid for a maximum of six years. During those six years a candidate will need to obtain the required experience and submit the required endorsement form for certification as a CISSP.

The CISSP credential is valid for three years; holders renew either by submitting 40 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits per year over three years or re-taking the exam. CPE credits are gained by complete relevant professional education. == Value == In 2005, Certification Magazine surveyed 35,167 IT professionals in 170 countries on compensation and found that CISSPs led their list of certificates ranked by salary. A 2006 Certification Magazine salary survey also ranked the CISSP credential highly, and ranked CISSP concentration certifications as the top best-paid credentials in IT. In 2008, another study came to the conclusion that IT professionals with CISSP (or other major security certifications) and at least 5 years of experience tend to have salaries around US, about US (or 26%) higher than IT professionals with similar experience levels who do not have such certificates.Brodkin, Jon (2008-06-11).

Note that any actual cause-and-effect relationship between the certificate and salaries remains unproven. As of 2017, a study by CyberSecurityDegrees.com surveyed some 10,000 current and historical cyber security job listings that preferred candidates holding CISSP certifications. CyberSecurityDegrees found that these job openings offered an average salary of more than the average cyber security salary.CyberSecurityDegrees.com's Study of the Most Lucrative Cyber Security Certifications.
