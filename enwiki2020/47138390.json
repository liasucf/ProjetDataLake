    "text": "The Greg Gutfeld Show is an American weekly late-night talk show on the Fox News Channel. It airs on Saturdays at 10:00 p.m. ET and is hosted by Greg Gutfeld, a self-described libertarian Fox News personality and co-host of the weekday round table show The Five. The show features a combination of political satire, comedy, and discussion regarding current events. ==Format== The show is modeled after traditional late-night talk shows, with Gutfeld (sitting behind his desk) interviewing two guests, who are typically comedians, political commentators and Fox News personalities, along with show regulars Katherine \"Kat\" Timpf (a conservative/libertarian writer and blogger) and Tyrus (a former professional wrestler and bodyguard for celebrities). When asked how he was discovered for the show, Tyrus said, \"I was just messing around on Twitter one day and I said to Greg about one of the jokes on his show, 'I got it. It took me a minute but I got it.' He said, 'You know I\u2019ve watched you. You\u2019re a pretty funny guy. Have you ever thought about coming on and doing the show?' I was like, 'Are you serious?!' He was like, 'Yeah, I\u2019ll give you a shot.'\" The show commonly begins with Gutfeld performing a monologue, usually satirical or simply poking fun at current events. He then introduces his guests. They discuss the week's topics in a lighthearted way, focusing more on humor rather than rigorous political debate. == Reception == In 2015, Kelefa Sanneh, in The New Yorker, praised the show, saying that it was funnier than Red Eye, which \"was often nauseating.\" ==See also== *Red Eye *The 1/2 Hour News Hour ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:2010s American political comedy television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:2020s American late-night television series Category:2020s American political comedy television series Category:2020s American satirical television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Fox News original programming Category:Libertarianism in the United States Category:Political satirical television series ",
