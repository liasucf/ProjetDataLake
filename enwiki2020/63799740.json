    "text": "\"Bonanza\" is the musical theme for the NBC western television series Bonanza starring Lorne Greene. It was written for the series by Jay Livingston and Raymond Evans. In 1961, it became a hit for Al Caiola and His Orchestra, whose instrumental recording (United Artists 302, backed with \"Bounty Hunter\") reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. Johnny Cash recorded an own version, with lyrics rewritten by him and his friend Johnny Western, and released it as a single on Columbia Records (Columbia 4-42512, \"Bonanza!\" with \"Pick a Bale o' Cotton\" on the opposite side) in July or August 1962. The Billboard magazine evaluated the single upon its release as having a \"moderate sales potential\", but \"Bonanza\" only grazed the Hot 100 and entirely missed the Billboard country chart, while \"Pick a Bale o' Cotton\" didn't make either. == Background == == Track listing == Johnny Cash version == Charts == Al Caiola and His Orchestra {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (1961) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- | US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"| 19 |} Johnny Cash version {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (1962) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- | US Cash Box Country Singles |align=\"center\"| 24 |- |} == References == Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:1961 singles Category:1962 singles Category:Songs with music by Jay Livingston Category:Columbia Records singles Category:1961 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Ray Evans ",
