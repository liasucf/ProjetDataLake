    "text": "Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time is the third studio album by American dream pop band Candy Claws. It was released in 2013 through Two Syllable Records. It is a concept album with a narrative about seal-like beast and her human partner questing through the Mesozoic Era, which was adapted from the fictional document \"Blood Ark\". The album's title also alludes to Roman goddess Ceres and Greek goddess Calypso. ==Critical reception== Pitchfork critic Ian Cohen considered Ceres & Calypso as \"certainly one of 2013\u2019s more unique records\" and \"immersive listening experience, but also a claustrophobic one.\" Cohen also further wrote: \"It all leads to Ceres & Calypso feeling like concrete evidence of their [Candy Claws'] hippie cred, chock full of fantastic ideas and lacking just enough follow through.\" Philip Cosores of Diffuser.fm called the record \"forward-thinking, intellectual, challenging, post-Animal Collective music doesn\u2019t belong to these times\" and stated that the band's \"genre-hopping, while remaining true to their earthy psychedelic aesthetic, is enjoyable for any listener with the patience to take an indirect trip.\" In a more mixed review, Consequence of Sound's Adam Kivel wrote that the album \"would seem perfectly suited for a brain-melting, painstakingly detailed animated film, both in story and in its evocative soundtracking potential.\" Kivel also concluded: \"Though often too big to fully comprehend, Ceres & Calypso is the kind of album you wish you could get lost in, perhaps by opening up a wardrobe and climbing right in.\" The album gained attention from online music communities, including Album of the Year, where it is ranked 8th on the user-determined list of the best albums of 2013, and Rate Your Music, where it is ranked the 11th best album of 2013. ==Track listing== # \"Into the Deep Time (One Sun)\" \u2014 3:02 # \"White Seal (Shell & Spine)\" \u2014 3:44 # \"Fell in Love (At the Water)\" \u2014 4:01 # \"Pangaea Girls (Magic Feeling)\" \u2014 3:12 # \"New Forest (Five Heads of the Sun)\" \u2014 3:24 # \"Transitional Bird (Clever Girl)\" \u2014 4:26 # \"Charade (Fern Prairie)\" \u2014 3:20 # \"Fallen Tree Bridge (Brave Rainbow Rider)\" \u2014 3:30 # \"Birth of the Flower (Seagreen)\" \u2014 3:47 # \"Illusion (Fern Lake)\" \u2014 3:35 # \"Night Ela (Mystic Thing)\" \u2014 5:04 # \"Where I Found You (One Star)\" \u2014 3:07 ==Personnel== Album personnel as adapted from Bandcamp: ;Candy Claws * Hank Bertholf \u2014 performance * Karen McCormick \u2014 performance * Ryan Hover \u2014 performance, production ;Other personnel * Jenn Morea \u2014 lyrics * Bryan Senti \u2014 orchestration ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 albums Category:Candy Claws albums Category:Dream pop albums by American artists Category:Concept albums Category:Shoegazing albums by American artists Category:Noise pop albums ",
