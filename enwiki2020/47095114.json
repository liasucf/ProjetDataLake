    "text": "I'm from Missouri is a 1939 American comedy film directed by Theodore Reed and written by Duke Atteberry and Jack Moffitt. The film stars Bob Burns, Gladys George, Gene Lockhart, Judith Barrett, William \"Bill\" Henry and Patricia Morison. The film was released on April 7, 1939, by Paramount Pictures. ==Plot== Sweeney Bliss raises prize-winning mules in Missouri. He travels to London with a twofold purpose, to sell mules to the government there and to find a fitting husband for daughter Julie Bliss, perhaps a British dignitary or someone equally suitable. Complications set in when rival Porgie Rowe also arrives from Missouri, persuading the government that his tractors would be of more use to them than Sweeney's mules. == Cast == *Bob Burns as Sweeney Bliss *Gladys George as Julie Bliss *Gene Lockhart as Porgie Rowe *Judith Barrett as Lola Pike *William \"Bill\" Henry as Joel Streight *Patricia Morison as Mrs. Allison 'Rowe' Hamilton *E.

Frank Nugent of The New York Times said, \"The too-long absence from our cinematic midst of that genial and characteristically asymmetrical map of the Southwest Territory, the physiognomy of Bob Burns, is sensibly and, in a few low-comedy high spots, inspiredly repaired by I'm From Missouri, at the Paramount. A pleasant variation on the commonplace folksiness-vs.-social-ambition theme, carried this time to the length of finally involving half the British peerage in a riotous Missouri hoe-down, the picture is a hare-brained and occasionally hilarious example of a type of Western which we can only classify as mule opera. It is also \u2014need we emphasize? \u2014one of the funniest of this year's crop of comedies.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1939 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1939 comedy films Category:Films directed by Theodore Reed Category:American black-and-white films ",
