    "text": "The UniSport Nationals is a multi-sport event held annually between the 43 Australian universities and tertiary institutions. Overseen by UniSport Australia, the peak governing body of university sport in Australia, the nationals is the flagship event on the university sporting calendar and attracts over 6,000 competitors each year. The nationals consist of Division 1, Division 2 and a smaller number of standalone sporting competitions held throughout the year. The UniSport Nationals replaced events hosted by individual sports and brought together university sports (intervarsities) and the then tertiary college sports (intercollegiates) into the one competitive arena, aiming to bring more athletes together in a larger event. Teams qualify through regional university games. The Northern University Games are for universities from Queensland, Northern Territory and Northern New South Wales. The Eastern University Games are for universities from most of New South Wales and the ACT. The Southern University Games are for teams from Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The Western University Games Series covers teams from Western Australia. == History == The Games were first held in Melbourne at the inaugural Australian Universities Winter Games in 1992 and jointly hosted by the University of Melbourne, Monash University, La Trobe University and Deakin University.

The University of Western Australia became the first University outside the big 3 (the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, and Monash University) to win the Overall Title since 1994, when it clinched the 2010 title. The final Australian University Games concluded in 2017 with the University of Technology Sydney, claiming their second title.
