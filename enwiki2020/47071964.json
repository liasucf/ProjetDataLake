An urban legend states that the first club meeting was held in local resident Mamil Musafija's restaurant. In the pre-Second World War period from the early 1930s until the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the club was considered among the best in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the end of the Second World War the club was reestablished and took part in lower levels of the Yugoslav league system. After the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Krivaja has competed in the second and third-tier. ==See also== *Football in Bosnia and Herzegovina *Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina ==References== Category:Association football clubs established in 1919 Category:Football clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Sport in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Football clubs in Yugoslavia ",
