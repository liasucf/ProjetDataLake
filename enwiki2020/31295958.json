    "text": "Genous is an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) capture technology manufactured by OrbusNeich that promotes the accelerated natural healing of the vessel wall after stent implantation. The pro-healing technology has an antibody surface coating that captures circulating CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells to the device, forming a functional endothelial layer over the stent to protect against thrombus and minimize restenosis.Bylander, Jessica (27 October 2008). \"New Stents On The Block: Innovators Look Beyond Drug Coatings.\" The Gray Sheet.\"Novel stent promotes healing of vessel wall after implantation\" Cardiology Today The Genous Stent is a bio-engineered coronary stent coated with immobilized anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies specific to the Genous technology.\"Genous stent is a safe and effective option in STEMI patients\" Cardiovascular News International The Combo Dual Therapy Stent is a coronary stent that combines Genous with an antiproliferative, biodegradable sirolimus drug elution.
