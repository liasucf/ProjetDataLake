He is associated with the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting. ==Biography== Kaempff received his first training from 1883\u201386 at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, then at the Academy of Karlsruhe under :de:Gustav Sch\u00f6nleber (1851\u20131917) and finally at the Berlin Academy in the studio of Hans Gude (1825\u20131903). In 1905 he married his student, Else Schwager, and was appointed professor a year later. From 1908 he lived in Hamburg, later becoming a member of the Hamburg Artists Association. In 1904 he and his wife were founder members of the Oldenburg Art Society. M\u00fcller- Kaempff was a successful landscape artist. He produced watercolours, pastels and drawings as well as furniture designs and a multitude of postcards. He was also an accomplished lithographer and produced bird illustrations for the revised edition of Naumann's \"Naturgeschichte der V\u00f6gel Mitteleuropas\". During his lifetime his works were acquired by museums in Rostock, Oldenburg, Kiel and Hamburg, and bought by numerous private collectors as far afield as Argentina and China. Prince Eitel Friedrich, the second son of Emperor Wilhelm II, acquired several of M\u00fcller-Kaempff's pieces for the imperial court in 1908. M\u00fcller-Kaempff stayed in touch with his former fellow-student, Georg M\u00fcller vom Siel, and visited him at D\u00f6tlingen in June 1908. On a hike in 1889 with his friend, Oskar Frenzel (1855\u20131915), they discovered the secluded fishing village of Ahrenshoop. M\u00fcller-Kaempff was so inspired by the isolated hamlet that he moved there, built himself a house in 1892, and started the painting school of St. Lucas in 1894. Fellow artists followed his lead, and soon the artists' colony was home to Anna Gerresheim (1852\u20131921), Elisabeth von Eicken (1862\u20131940), Friedrich Wachenhusen (1859\u20131925), (1850\u20131924), (1859\u20131922), (1866\u20131913) and (1854\u20131904). ==Selected paintings== Paul M\u00fcller- Kaempff03.jpg|Farmstead with Cornfield File:Paul M\u00fcller-Kaempf - Die Ostsee bei Ahrenshoop.jpg|The Baltic Sea near Ahrenshoop File:M\u00fcller-Kaempf P.@Ahrenshop v Hohen Ufer.JPG|The High Path at Ahrenshoop File:Paul M\u00fcller- Kaempff Dar\u00df Winter 21.jpg|Dar\u00df Winter ==Sources== * Paul M\u00fcller-Kaempff: \"Erinnerungen an Ahrenshoop\" In: Mecklenburgische Monatshefte, Schwerin, Bd. 2 (1926), 7, S. 333\u2013336.
