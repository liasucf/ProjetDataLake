The skyscraper is set to reach a height of 350 meters with 70 floors and set to be finished in 2041, which upon its completion will make it the tallest wooden skyscraper, as well as Japan's highest, over all, skyscraper. The skyscraper is set to be a mixed-used building including residential, office and retail space. ==Description== It is supposed to be made of 90% wood and the rest being steel, steel braces will be used to enhance resistance to wind and earthquakes due to the area's high seismic activity. Wood was chosen since timber-based structures have proven to be very resistant to earthquakes. The project requires 185,000 cubic meters of timber (or 6.5 million cubic feet), and plans to revitalize forestry and timber demand in Japan. The choice of wood, aside from its aesthetics, is aiming \"to transform the town into a forest\". Wooden structures are also easier to rebuild or replace if it collapse than concrete structures. Two-thirds of Japan is covered by forest, making it the 2nd most tree-covered country of the OECD countries after Finland. Most of Japan's cedars and cypresses were planted after the Second World War and reaching maturity in the 2010s.Nguyen Trung, World's tallest wooden skyscraper planned in Tokyo, Redtoolead.com, 21 July 2019 The skyscraper is designed by the architectural firm Nikken Sekkei, and build by the developer Sumitomo Forestry.
