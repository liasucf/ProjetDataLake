    "text": "Space Museum is the sole studio album by British minimal wave band Solid Space. It was released in 1982 by In Phaze Records through cassette, eventually becoming a rarity. It was produced by the record label's owner Pat Bermingham.Solid Space - Space Museum liner notes. The album's sound has been described as \"cold, disconnected, minimal synth-pop full of eerie moods and bizarre melodies.\" It features lyrics inspired by science fiction novels and television programs, in particular the popular shows Doctor Who and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, and often deal with traveling through the galaxy, \"delivered in a robotic deadpan vocals.\" Tracks such as \"A Darkness In My Soul\" (inspired by the Dean Koontz novel of the same name), \"Destination Moon\" (based on The Adventures of Tintin novel of the same name), and \"Tenth Planet\" were also considered as \"dark, atmospheric and atypical\", because they feature guitar along with synthesizers and drum machines. The album was named number 2 on Fact magazine's list of \"The 20 best Minimal Wave records ever made\". The cover art is taken from a publicity still from the Doctor Who serial \"The Wheel in Space\". Two song titles on the album, also reference Doctor Who serials: \"The Tenth Planet\" and \"Earthshock\", which like \"The Wheel in Space\", also feature the Cybermen. On December 10, 2017, a remastered version of Space Museum was released by the label Dark Entries http://www.darkentriesrecords.com/store/vinyl/solid-space-space-museum-lp/.
