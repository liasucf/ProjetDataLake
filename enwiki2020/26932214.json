    "text": "Broken Britain is a term which has been used by the Conservative Party to describe a perceived widespread state of social decay in the United Kingdom. The Sun has run frequent stories under the \"Broken Britain\" theme since 2007. Whilst the phrase is essentially a political one, the frequency of these stories has decreased since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. == Political usage == David Cameron had referred to \"Broken Britain\" during his time as leader of the Conservative Party, and pledged to \"fix\" Broken Britain during the campaign for the 2010 general election. In September 2009, The Sun announced that it would back the Conservatives in the 2010 election, having supported the Labour Party in 1997, 2001 and 2005, stating that Labour had \"failed on law and order\". Iain Duncan Smith published two reports, \"Breakdown Britain\" and \"Breakthrough Britain\", dealing with similar themes, through the Centre for Social Justice. By contrast, The Guardian ran a series of articles in 2010 questioning this theme, under the title \"Is Britain Broken?\". The Conservatives also came under criticism after publishing an inaccurate figure in a report on teenage pregnancy and crime rates. After the 2011 England riots, David Cameron alluded to many of these themes while speaking on the UK's \"moral collapse\". Under the banner of \"Broken Society\", he listed: \"irresponsibility, selfishness, behaving as if your choices have no consequences, children without fathers, schools without discipline, reward without effort, crime without punishment, rights without responsibilities\". == In popular culture == A number of films released from 2006 featured the theme of Broken Britain. They include Ill Manors, Harry Brown, F (film), Eden Lake, Cherry Tree Lane, The Disappeared, Summer Scars, Outlaw, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael and Heartless. The 2000 AD story Cradlegrave also played with similar \"hoodie horror\" themes. == See also == * Social structure of the United Kingdom * Chav * Crime in the United Kingdom * Booze Britain * Rip-off Britain General: * Criticisms of welfare * Social cohesion * Social disintegration ==References== Category:Urban decay in Europe Category:Criticisms of welfare Category:Mass media theories Category:Conservative Party (UK) terms Category:21st century in the United Kingdom Category:Mass media in the United Kingdom Category:2011 England riots Category:Welfare state in the United Kingdom Category:David Cameron Category:Political terms in the United Kingdom ",
