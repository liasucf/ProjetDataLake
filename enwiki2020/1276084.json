Sinil\u00f3an is a center of education, commerce and transportation, serving towns in eastern Laguna and some towns from the provinces of Quezon and Rizal. The municipality has active business and trade activities. ==Etymology== From the early period of Spanish colonialisation, some female inhabitants of the place were milling their palay in their fields. While doing this, some Spaniards came and asked them, \"Como se llama esta pueblo?\" The natives, not knowing Spanish thought that they were asked what they were doing and one of them answered, \"cam\u00ed po ay gumiguiling\". The Spaniards repeated, \"Guiling-Guiling\", to which the natives nodded. Some this place known as \"Guiling-Guiling\" from 1583 to 1604. Another story has it that during the later part of the year 1604, three brothers, namely, Juan Puno, Juan Pili, and Juan Puhuwan, migrated into this community. They selected a lot adjacent to the river R\u00edo Romelo and divided it equally among themselves. When the parish priest saw the ingenuity of the three brothers in equally dividing the land, he asked the natives how equally was expressed in Tagalog. The natives gave him the expression \"Sinloan\". Right then and there, the name Guiling-Guiling was changed to Siniloang which meant justice, equality and fairness. The word travelled from mouth to mouth with sound variations. Because of the difficulty of some Spaniards in pronouncing Siniloang, the name Siniloan struck and became the official name of this town. The name Siniloan is also believed to have been taken from a legendary story about Luis and Ana, a married couple who chased a wild boar from a place called Luisiana. They ran after that big boar from Luisiana to Cavinti (kapit sa Binti). The people along the way who saw Luis and Ana chasing the boar took pity on them and helped them to catch it. The people chased the boar through the towns of Lumb\u00e1n, Kalayaan, Lo\u00f1gos, Pa\u00e9te, Paquil, and Pa\u00f1guil until they finally caught the boar in this town by means of the lassoed captivity or Siniloan.
