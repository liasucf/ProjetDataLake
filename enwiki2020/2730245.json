    "text": "Thomas & Friends (previously known as Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends) is a children's television series about the engines and other characters working on the railways of the Island of Sodor, and is based on The Railway Series books written by the Reverend W. Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the eighth series of the show, which was first broadcast in 2004. This series was narrated by Michael Angelis for the United Kingdom audiences, while Michael Brandon narrated the episodes for the United States audiences. This is the first season produced by HIT Entertainment. ==Production== Starting with this series, Thomas & Friends broadcast in the United States for the first time as a whole television program. It had first appeared as sequences from the American television show Shining Time Station from 1989 to 1995. For the eighth series, Steve Asquith (after 20 years as a crew member) took over as director from David Mitton (who had directed the show since its first series) and Simon Spencer became the producer. In addition, Robert Hartshorne and Ed Welch took over as composers and songwriters after Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell departed. Paul Larson and Abi Grant were the script editors for this series. This was the first series to introduce a new opening and closing credits, plus a brief description of the Island of Sodor before each episode began. Also starting with this series, the length of the episodes were increased to seven minutes from the original four-and-a-half minutes. The series was produced using digital Betacam Sp video cameras, which created a somewhat different look for the show. There was also a subtle shift towards the use of CGI elements, provided by HiT Entertainment's subsidiary HOT Animation,How Thomas the Tank Engine Works although filming remained at Shepperton Studios. For the United States broadcasts, other changes include the additions of CGI sequences in mini-segments between episodes, transition effects, and a book opening intro section. This series was also the first series that saw the use of The Steam Team, the centralised cast of eight characters including Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, Toby and Emily. ==30-minute episode version== This is an episode format that includes 2 episodes of Season 8 and a short episode from Season 7 in the middle of the airing. In addition, it also includes educational segments and additional songs. ==Episodes== ==Characters== * Thomas the Tank Engine * Edward the Blue Engine * Henry the Green Engine * Gordon the Big Engine * James the Red Engine * Percy the Small Engine * Toby the Tram Engine * Emily * Spencer the Grand * Arthur * Harvey the Crane Engine * Devious Diesel * Mavis the Quarry Diesel * 'Arry and Bert * Salty the Dockyard Diesel * Annie and Clarabel * Bertie the Bus * Elizabeth the Vintage Lorry * Harold the Helicopter * Cranky the Crane * Sir Topham Hatt / The Fat Controller * Farmer McColl * Murdoch * Trevor * Allicia Botti * The Duke and Duchess of Boxford * Henrietta * Stephen Hatt * Bridget Hatt * Tiger Moth ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== Category:2004 British television seasons Category:Thomas & Friends seasons ",
