    "text": "\"Beetlebum\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released in January 1997 as the lead single from the band's eponymous fifth album, Blur. The single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Blur's second track to reach the top of the charts (after \"Country House\"). ==Background== The song is about heroin and the drug experiences Damon Albarn had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica.No Distance Left to Run 2010 film Albarn has stated in an interview with MTV that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of \"sleepy\" and sort of \"sexy\".MTV Blurography \u2013 Broadcast December 1996 The song has been described as a \"Beatles tribute\" by several publications; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that the song \"[ran] through the White Album in the space of five minutes.\" ==Music video== The \"Beetlebum\" music video was directed by Sophie Muller. It is a relatively simple production, combining a performance of the song in a room in a tall building with computer-generated zoom-outs from the set showing the Earth in the centre of kaleidoscopic patterns. Alex James' cigarette and Dave Rowntree's Coke can are censored. Damon falls down and rolls on a carpet with pictures of poppies. At the end of the video, the camera zooms out of the room and the building and shows the surrounding area, ending with a shot of London's skyline. The band's behaviour throughout the video is muted compared to Blur's earlier videos, including \"Girls & Boys\", \"Parklife\", and \"Country House\". ==Track listing== All music composed by Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree. All lyrics composed by Albarn.
