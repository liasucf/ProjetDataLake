    "text": "Wolf Junge (5 January 1903 in Schwarzenberg / Saxe) was a German naval officer of World War II. As a Kapit\u00e4n zur See, he was appointed the executive officer of the battleship Tirpitz in August 1943 under Kapit\u00e4n zur See Hans Meyer. He temporarily took control of the ship on 3 April 1944 when Meyer was badly wounded during the Operation Tungsten air attack on Tirpitz. Junge was subsequently confirmed in this role during May. However, he was unpopular with the battleship's crew as he was perceived to have had little experience operating warships at sea. Junge handed command of Tirpitz to Kapit\u00e4n zur See Robert Weber in November 1944. ==References== ;Citations ;Works consulted * * Category:Kriegsmarine personnel ",
