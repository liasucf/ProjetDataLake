    "text": "Catherine Hyndman (born 31 August 1990) is a Northern Irish footballer and football coach. A versatile left-sided player, she has appeared for the Northern Ireland women's national team. ==Career== Hyndman was born in Belfast and moved with her family to Grange, County Sligo when she was 12 years old. She was selected for the Northern Ireland women's national under-19 football team while playing for Colchester United of the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division in England. She later played as a defender for Women's National League club Castlebar Celtic, while she attended Institute of Technology, Sligo. When Castlebar Celtic folded, she continued her football career by travelling to play for Sion Swifts of the Northern Ireland Women's Premiership. This was due to a lack of women's football teams in the Border Region. Hyndman has been capped for the Northern Ireland national team, appearing for the team during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifying cycle. She was named in the senior squad for the final UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying fixture against Belarus at The Showgrounds, Newry in July 2008. She started the match as Northern Ireland drew 1\u20131 and collected their first ever point in the Euro qualifying stage. Hyndman's nickname is Dizzy. When Sligo Rovers entered the Women's Under-17 National League in June 2018, Hyndman was announced as part of the coaching team. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland women's international footballers Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Women's National League (Ireland) players Category:Women's Premiership (Northern Ireland) players Category:Sion Swifts Ladies F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Castlebar Celtic W.F.C. players ",
