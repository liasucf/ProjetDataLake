He has been the leader of the group which has associated itself with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) since Isnilon Hapilon's death in 2017. ==Early life== Hajan Sawadjaan was born in Jolo, Sulu, to a peasant family. He likely only finished primary education according to a source from the Philippine military. Due to financial difficulties, he worked as a lumberjack in Patikul and married a woman native of Tanum. ==Career== As an elder, he served as a preacher in a local mosque. His involvement in preaching earned him the title of \"hatib\" or sermon leader in Arabic. Sawadjaan first joined the secessionist group, Moro National Liberation Front and was under commander Radulan Sahiron. He went with Sahiron in breaking away from the MNLF to join the Abu Sayyaf in 1992. At that time the group has been recently organized by Yusop Jikiri who was also a leader of the MNLF. Abu Sayaff would affiliate themselves to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group. In 2017, Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon was killed during the Battle of Marawi. Hapilon was the designated as \"emir\" for ISIL operations in Southeast Asia. According to Filipino authorities Sawadjaan sometime in 2018 has pledged to become the leader of ISIL affiliated groups in the Philippines. A United States report likewise said that Sawadjaan is serving as acting \"emir\" of ISIL in the region although has maintained that there are no confirmed direct links with Filipino militants with the central organization of the Middle East-based ISIL. ==References== Category:Abu Sayyaf members Category:Filipino Islamists Category:Leaders of Islamic terror groups Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
