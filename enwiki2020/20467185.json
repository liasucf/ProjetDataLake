    "text": "LGBTQ representations in hip hop music have been historically low. Hip hop has long been portrayed as one of the least LGBTQ-friendly genres of music (along with heavy metal and country music) with a significant body of hip hop music containing homophobic views and anti-gay lyrics. Attitudes towards homosexuality in hip hop culture have historically been negative. Gay slurs like \"sus\", \"no homo\", and \"pause\" can be heard in hip hop lyrics from the industry\u2019s biggest stars. According to the LA Times, these slurs were used to put \"queerness as a punchline\". However, since the early 2000s there has been a flourishing community of LGBTQ hip hop artists, activists and performers breaking barriers in the mainstream music industry. Labels such as homo hop or queer hip hop group all artists identifying as members of the LGBTQ community into a subgenre of hip hop based solely on their sexuality. These subgenre labels are not marked by any specific production style, as artists within it may simultaneously be associated with virtually any other subgenre of hip hop, or may also make music that falls outside the subgenre entirely.\"Is British Rap Finally Going to Have a Gay Hip Hop Scene?\". Noisey, August 7, 2014. Rather, the terms are defined by a direct engagement with LGBTQ culture in elements such as the lyrical themes or the artist's visual identity and presentation.\"Homo Hop\". Studio 360, June 26, 2009.\"Underground fruit gangstas: uncovering the hidden subculture of homo-hop music\". Columbia Chronicle, September 10, 2012. Artists who have been labelled as part of the genre have, however, varied in their acceptance of the terminology. Some have supported the identification of a distinct phenomenon of \"LGBTQ hip hop\" as an important tool for promoting LGBTQ visibility in popular music, while others have criticized it for essentially ghettoizing their music as a \"niche\" interest that circumscribed their appeal to mainstream music fans. Many artists have contributed to the increased visibility and social acceptance of the LGBTQ community's presence in hip hop music, most notably Frank Ocean, who penned an open letter addressing his sexuality in 2012. Artists such as Mykki Blanco, Big Freedia, Le1f, Tyler, the Creator and Cakes da Killa are also at the forefront of creating a more inclusive representation of bodies in the hip hop genre. There has also been an increased presence of LGBTQ allies in the mainstream hip hop community, such as Jay-Z, Murs, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. ==History== ===Early slurs=== In 1979, the Sugarhill Gang released \"Rapper\u2019s Delight\", the first hip hop record to become a top 40 hit. \"Rapper's Delight\" referred to fictional character Superman as a \"fairy\" for wearing a skin-tight garment. In 1986, the hip hop trio Beastie Boys originally wanted to name their debut album Don't Be A Faggot, but their record label Columbia Records refused to release it under that title, so it changed the title to Licensed to Ill. Years later, the Beastie Boys formally apologized to the LGBT community for the \"shitty and ignorant\" things they said on their first record. Kanye West denounced homophobia in hip-hop in an August, 2005 interview with MTV News' Sway Calloway. He discussed how his environment led him to be homophobic, and how finding out his cousin was gay changed his perspective. This statement was radical at the time - the first major statement against homophobia in hip-hop by a popular artist. ===Homo hop=== The homo hop movement first emerged in the 1990s as an underground movement, particularly in California,\"Homo Hop is dead, Queer hip hop is the real deal\" . 429 Magazine, March 11, 2013. in part as a reaction to the widespread acceptance of homophobia in the lyrics of mainstream hip hop performers such as Eminem.\"Hip-Hop's Great Gay Hope: Rainbow Noise\". Spin, April 1, 2011. Lyrics in songs such as \"Criminal\" on The Marshal Mathers LP demonstrate this homophobia. Initially coined by Tim'm T. West of Deep Dickollective, the term \"homo hop\" was not meant to signify a distinct genre of music, but simply to serve as a community building tool and promotional hook for LGBT artists. According to West: West's bandmate Juba Kalamka offered a similar assessment: In a 2001 interview with SFGate.com, West elaborated on the movement's goals: The genre received a mainstream publicity boost in 2002 and 2003 when Caushun was widely reported as the first openly LGBT rapper to be signed to a major label,\"Move over, gangstas: Here comes homo-hop\". The Globe and Mail, May 31, 2003. although Caushun was later revealed to have been a publicity stunt engineered by heterosexual musician Ivan Matias. Notable events in the 2000s included the PeaceOUT World Homo Hop Festival, which was founded in 2001 and mounted annually until 2008, and the 2006 documentary film Pick Up the Mic. However, some music critics in this era dismissed the genre as too often sacrificing musical quality in favour of a \"didactic\" political agenda. The most commercially successful LGBT rapper in the 2000s was Cazwell, who emerged as a popular artist in gay dance clubs, and has to date scored six top 40 hits on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart, with a hybrid pop-rap style which he has described as \"if Biggie Smalls ate Donna Summer for breakfast\". Cazwell described his philosophy of music as \"create your own space, your own music and have people come to you,\" and has noted in interviews that he achieved much greater success by \"breaking\" the rules of the hip hop industry than he ever did in his earlier attempts to pursue mainstream success with the 1990s hip hop duo Morplay.\"Rapper Cazwell Opens Up About Being Gay in Hip Hop\". NBC Miami, July 6, 2011. One of the first mainstream artists to speak out publicly against anti-gay discrimination in hip hop was Kanye West in a 2004 interview with Sway Calloway on MTV News. In the interview Kanye says, \"Hip-hop does discriminate against gay people. I want to just come on TV and tell my rappers, my friends, just stop it, fam. Seriously, that's really discrimination\". Kanye criticized the hip-hop community, saying, \"Hip-hop seemed like it was about fighting for your rights in the beginning, about speaking your mind, and breaking down barriers or whatever, but everybody in hip-hop discriminates against gay people. To me, that's one of the standards in hip-hop is to be like, 'You fag, you gay'\". ===Later negative representations=== In Byron Hurt's 2006 documentary Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, Hurt explores the nuanced relationships between hip-hop, masculinity, misogyny, and homophobia. Recognizing the presence of these issues in hip-hop, a genre he loves, Hurt felt a sense of hypocrisy and began working on the film. In the documentary Hurt travels around the country and interviews rap and hip hop artists, academics, and fans about their perceptions on these issues in the culture. After conducting dozens of interviews, Hurt sees a continued pattern of homophobia linked to the need to prove one's masculinity. Through the objectification of women and emasculation of other men to assert another person\u2019s masculinity, a pattern of homophobia occurs in the hip hop and rap community. Rapper Busta Rhymes walks out of his interview when he is asked a question about homophobia in the rap community. Rhymes says, \"I can't partake in that conversation,\" followed by, \"With all due respect, I ain't trying to offend nobody. . . What I represent culturally doesn't condone [homosexuality] whatsoever.\" This reaction from Rhymes exemplifies part of the negative perception of homosexuality in the hip-hop community. == Song lyrics == Ice-T stated on his autobiography that record-label executive Seymour Stein took exception to a line in his song \"409\": \"Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy / If a guy wants a guy, please take it outside\". Ice-T later became one of the first rappers to condemn homophobia on raps such as Straight Up Nigga and The Tower in his album O.G. Original Gangster (1991). Many songs by rapper Eminem have been considered homophobic for his frequent use of anti-gay slurs, especially the song \"Criminal\" from his third album The Marshall Mathers LP (2000), which containing lines like: \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or les', Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's 'yes'\". In an interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, Eminem denied being homophobic and explained the frequent use of the term \"faggot\" in his lyrics, that this word was \"thrown around constantly\" in battle rap, and that he does not use it to refer to gay people. The album The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year by the Grammy Awards 2001, which led to protests due to the album's controversial content. At the show, Eminem performed \"Stan\" with openly gay musician Elton John in response. He also did a song with Young M.A in 2020. In the lyrics of one song on rapper Trick- Trick's 2008 album The Villain, he refers to Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as \"dyke bitches\" and says that he will send a \"scud missile right through their fucking cruise ship\". Trick-Trick expressed his dislike towards homosexuals in an interview with music site AllHipHop: \u201cFaggots hate me and I don\u2019t give a fuck. I don\u2019t want your faggot money any goddam way.\u201d The phrase \"No Homo\" is often used in today's hip hop lyrics and Black culture. It means \"no gay things\" or \"nothing gay\". One example of the term's usage is in the Jay-Z song, \"Run This Town\". Kanye West, one of the featured artists on the song, stated, \"It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow / to everybody on your dick...no homo.\"https://www.glsen.org/blog/no-homo-hip-hop-and- homophobia-part-1 ==Evolution== By the early 2010s, a new wave of openly LGBT hip hop musicians began to emerge, spurred in part by the increased visibility and social acceptance of LGBT people,\"Zebra Katz, Mykki Blanco and the rise of queer rap\". The Guardian, June 9, 2012. the coming out of mainstream hip hop stars such as Azealia Banks and Frank Ocean,\"Hip-Hop\u2019s Bustin\u2019 out the Closet\" . David Atlanta, August 1, 2012. and the release of LGBT-positive songs by heterosexual artists such as Murs, Macklemore, and Ryan Lewis. Although inspired and empowered by the homo hop movement, this newer generation of artists garnered more mainstream media coverage and were able to make greater use of social media tools to build their audience, and thus did not need to rely on the old homo hop model of community building. Many of these artists were also strongly influenced by the LGBT African American ball culture, an influence not widely seen in the first wave of homo hop, and many began as performance art projects and incorporated the use of drag.\"We Invented Swag: NYC's Queer Rap\". Pitchfork, March 21, 2012. Accordingly, many of the newer artists were identified in media coverage with the newer \"queer hip hop\" label instead of \"homo hop\". In 2008, Jipsta released the single \"Middle of the Dancefloor\" which spent a total of 14 weeks (peaking at #6 for two consecutive weeks) on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart. This achievement was noteworthy for LGBT hip-hop as it marked the first time an openly gay white rapper earned a Top 10 single on the Billboard Club Play chart. The following year, Jipsta released a cover of the George Michael song \"I Want Your Sex\", which rose to the #4 position on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart in only 4 weeks time, resulting in the first Top 5 Billboard charting record by an LGBT hip-hop artist. In March 2012, Carrie Battan of Pitchfork profiled Mykki Blanco, Le1f, Zebra Katz and House of Ladosha in an article titled \"We Invented Swag: NYC Queer Rap\" about \"a group of NYC artists [who] are breaking down ideas of hip- hop identity\". In October 2012, Details profiled several LGBT hip hop artists \"indelibly changing the face\u2014and sound\u2014of rap\".\"Hip Hop's Queer Pioneers\". Details, October 2012. In March 2014 the online magazine Norient.com published a first overview of queer hip hop videos worldwide. The article talks about topics, aesthetics and challenges of LGBT hip hop in Angola, Argentina, Cuba, Germany, Israel, Serbia, South Africa and the USA.\"\"Queer Hip Hop Clips From 8 Countries\". Norient, March 2014. In December 2016, Los Angeles-based rapper Thed Jewel, who raps \"My skin is black, sexuality is Fuchsia\" said: \"There are a lot of rappers that are homosexuals and their day to be open with it will come one way or another\". In August 2018, openly gay member of Brockhampton, Kevin Abstract voiced his efforts to change Hip Hop's issue with homophobia in an interview with the BBC by stating: \"I have to exist in a homophobic space in order to make change and that homophobic space would be the hip hop community. So me just existing and being myself is making change and making things easier for other young queer kids\". In June 2019 Lil Nas X, who performed the hit song \"Old Town Road\", took the opportunity to publicly come out during Pride Month, making him one of the most visible Black queer male singers to do so, especially in country or hip hop genres, which emphasize machismo and \"historically snubbed queer artists\". Black queer male artists in hip hop gaining mainstream acceptance is relatively new\u2014preceding Nas X by less than a decade\u2014including: Frank Ocean\u2019s 2012 Channel Orange, Tyler, the Creator, ILoveMakonnen, Brockhampton frontman Kevin Abstract and Steve Lacy. Black queer female artists have been accepted more readily; while the underground queer hip hop movement goes back to the 1990s.\"Homo Hop is dead, Queer hip hop is the real deal\" . 429 Magazine, March 11, 2013. ==Criticism== Some artists, however, have criticized the genre as an arbitrary label that can potentially limit the artist's audience and may not actually correspond to their artistic goals or career aspirations. In 2013, Brooke Candy told The Guardian: One unspecified artist declined to be interviewed for the Guardian feature at all, stating that he preferred to be known as a rapper rather than as a \"gay rapper\". Eric Shorey, author of \u201cQueer Rap is Not Queer Rap,\u201d contests \u201cqueer rap\u201d labeling, arguing that \u201ccomparisons between gay and straight rap (as if they were two distinct genres) simply doesn\u2019t make sense without implied bigotry\u201d. As Shorey writes, this subversive genre is steeped in racism and homophobia in and of itself, and merely serves to further marginalize the identities and narratives it allegedly gives a voice to. Though Western society has a predisposition to impose socially construed labels and binaries, Shorey dismisses the notion of heteronormative categorical identification, insisting that listeners ignore these sexuality- based hip hop classifications and listen more closely to the quality of music being produced. He also suggests that queer artists should be booked alongside straight artists, showing that they are equally talented, and deserve the same amount of recognition. Despite criticism, others have been more circumspect about the dichotomy. British rapper RoxXxan told the Guardian that \"I want to be perceived as 'RoxXxan,' but if people label me as 'gay rapper RoxXxan' I'm not offended.\" Nicky Da B told Austinist that \"Basically, I perform for a LGBT crowd but also for everyone. A lot of the bounce rappers that are rapping and touring at the moment are all gay. The LGBT community just capitalizes on that I guess, from us being gay, and they support us on it, so that's how it goes I guess.\"\"Drop It Hot Potato Style: An Interview with Nicky Da B\". Austinist, November 1, 2012. === Commercialization === Another criticism arises from the perceived commercialization of LGBTQ representation by hip hop artists. A good example of this is with Nicki Minaj and her approach to presenting sexuality and sexual orientation. She often presents queerness in her music videos and lyrics. A notable moment was during her Vladtv interview where Nicki was asked how a man should approach her. She deflects and diverts to her love for women, saying \"I like girls to approach me\".VladTV. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzdIcpo8XYc At the same time Nicki has never explicitly confirmed queerness and has only publicly been associated with male significant others, lending her sexual orientation further ambiguity. This approach has been analyzed by critics of Nicki as strategic queerness and is often rejected by queer advocates as a performance, and is controversial because it may appear to be appropriative for commercial gain. ==Notable artists== * 070 Shake * Abdu Ali\"Push and slay: Abdu Ali finds his voice\".
