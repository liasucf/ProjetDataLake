    "text": "The MexiCali Biennial is a contemporary visual arts organization which focuses on the border between California and Mexico as a region of aesthetic production. The organization is migratory in nature and showcases exhibitions on both sides of the border. The MexiCali Biennial was originally started as a project critiquing the proliferation of international and regional art biennials and as a result may be shown at any time and at any location. The inaugural exhibition was in 2006 and subsequent programming occurred in the years spanning 2009 through 2010 and again in 2013. == History == The MexiCali Biennial was conceived in 2006 by artists Ed Gomez and Luis G. Hernandez. Curator Pilar Tompkins-Rivas was a founding member and curator of the inaugural exhibitions. The 2006 round of programming first took place at La Casa de la Tia Tina, an artist-run space on the border town of Mexicali, MX before traveling to Chavez Studios in East Los Angeles. Due to the nature of the biennial's programming, the second biennial didn't occur until 2009 through 2010, during which time it took place in four different locations in both Mexico and California. Dr. Amy Pederson Converse joined the board and served as co-curator for the 2009-2013 programming. Pederson Converse was instrumental in conceptualizing the theme for the third MexiCali Biennial, which was cannibalism, specifically in regard to philosopher 's studies of cultural cannibalism and its relationship to colonialism. == MexiCali Biennial 2006 == The 2006 MexiCali Biennial started in the border town of Mexicali, MX, at alternative art and music space La Casa de la Tia Tina before traveling to Chavez Studios in Los Angeles.

Hernandez and Amy Pederson Converse. == MexiCali Biennial 2013: Cannibalism in the New World == The 2013 programming was the first time that an official theme was conceived for the exhibitions. The theme of Cannibalism was influenced by philosopher Catalin Avramescu's research on the cannibal throughout history, in particular its place in colonialism. MB curator and art historian Amy Pederson Converse states, \"There is no need to draw a line between actual and symbolic anthropophagy; they are part of the same system of meaning. Through ingestion, digestion, and subsumation, the cannibal bridges the gap between political science and moral philosophy, nature and civilization, north, south, east and west, the self and the other.\" Artists chosen for MB 2013 were: * Fred Alvarado * Natalia Anciso * Marycarmen Arroyo Macias * Ana Baranda * Juan Bastardo * Sergio Bromberg * Helen Cahng * Matthew Carter * Carolyn Castano * Enrique Castrejon * Tony de los Reyes * Map Conception: Deborah Diehl & Arzu Arda Kosar * Dino Dinco and Rafa Esparza * Veronica Duarte * Roni Feldman * Kio Griffith and Carmina Escobar * Zoe Gruni * HELLO-O : Michael Dee, Martin Durazo, Ichiro Irie * Daniel Lara * Candice Lin * Juan Luna-Avin * Matt MacFarland * Dominic Paul Miller * Flavia Monteiro * Nancy Popp * Peter Bo Rappmund * Christopher Reynolds * Cindy Santos Bravo * Fidelius X Musical performance by Los Nuevos Maevans.
