It is found in Australia, where it has been recorded from Queensland and New South Wales. The wingspan is about 32 mm for males and 38 mm for females. The forewings are reddish ochreous with some darker irroration (sprinkles). There is an outwardly oblique dark reddish line from two-thirds of the costa to vein 6, there angled and inwardly oblique to three-fifths of the dorsum. The hindwings have a gently sinuate termen and are similar to the forewings, but the transverse line from the mid-dorsum is straight.Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. 51 : 414 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1926 Category:Drepaninae Category:Moths of Australia ",
