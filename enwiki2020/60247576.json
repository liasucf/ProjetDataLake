Talks were held with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which had been the ruling party since 1922, when the Soviet Union began. It was preceded by the 5th National Congress. It set in motion the 6th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It was held to address the failures of the First Great Communist Revolution in China. The revolution resulted in the Shanghai Massacre. The Chinese Civil War began after that point, and there would not be another Party congress until 1945. It was succeeded by the 7th National Congress. ==References== Category:National Congress of the Communist Party of China Category:1945 in China Category:1945 conferences ",
