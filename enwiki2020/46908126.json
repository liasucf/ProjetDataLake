    "text": "CSM Lugoj is a Romanian football club from Lugoj, Timis County, Romania. The club was named in the past, Vulturii Textila, after a textile company in the city of Lugoj. CSM Lugoj was founded under the name Vulturii Lugoj in 1920. The club is currently playing in Liga III, the third tier of the Romanian football league system. ==History== The club was promoted in 1934 to the newly formed Divizia B (The League II). It had previously only played in the regional championship of Banat where it had fared well since its founding. Through three seasons of constantly improving football in Divizia B, in 1937, the club made history. It convincingly defeated Mure\u015ful T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, and then beat Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti in the quarter-finals of the prestigious Romanian Cup. Despite this good run, they were eliminated in the semi-finals by the first division club Juventus Bucure\u0219ti. After the great season of 1937, the club rose to the top flight because the Divizia A League had been increased in that same year from 12 to 20 teams. Unfortunately, the club was pushed into relegation and back to a lower division the following year. Divizia A had once again decided to reduce itself to twelve participating clubs. In the years following, Vulturii was unable to show any kind of progress. They could not replay the amazing football they had once brought to the field in 1937. The club played in Divizia B and placed themselves around the middle of the league standings. Then World War II led to interruption in the league's functioning. After play resumed following the end of the war, the club dropped further and was relegated to the lowest division, Divizia C. This lasted for just one season. The club was relegated once again in the regional leagues. Vulturii Textila Lugoj played for almost twenty years in the regional leagues of the Timi\u0219 County, before the club managed to return to Divizia C in 1968. There, they were able to rise to second place and were then promoted during the year 1970\u201371, for a one-season into Divizia B, before being dropped again. Over the next 30 years, they constantly oscillated between the Divizia B and Divizia C. In 2002 the club was dissolved and a new team was founded under the name Auxerre Lugoj. In the summer of 2009, after the dissolution of Auxerre Lugoj, Vulturii Lugoj was refounded under the name of CSM Lugoj. In the summer of 2012, CSM Lugoj was renamed as Vulturii Lugoj. In the summer of 2015, the club changed its name from Vulturii Lugoj back to CSM Lugoj. ==Chronology of names== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" |- ! style=\"background:#0070FF;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #000000;\" |Name ! style=\"background:#0070FF;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #000000;\" |Period |- |align=left|Vulturii Lugoj |1920\u20131934 |- |align=left|Vulturii Textila Lugoj |1934\u20131946 |- |align=left|23 August Lugoj |1946\u20131947 |- |align=left|CSM Lugoj |1947\u20131948 |- |align=left|Vulturii Textila Lugoj |1948\u20131984 |- |align=left|CSM Lugoj |1984\u20131989 |- |align=left|Vulturii Lugoj |1989\u20132002 |- |align=left|CSM Lugoj |2009\u20132012 |- |align=left|Vulturii Lugoj |2012\u20132015 |- |align=left|CSM Lugoj |2015\u2013present |} *Note: 7 years of inactivity between 2002\u20132009, and the team was refounded as CSM Lugoj in the Liga V. ==Divizia A history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
