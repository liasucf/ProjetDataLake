    "text": "The Kristianstad Basin (Swedish: Kristianstadsbass\u00e4ngen) is a Cretaceous-age structural basin and geological formation in northeastern Sk\u00e5ne, the southernmost province of Sweden. The basin extends from Han\u00f6bukten, a bay in the Baltic Sea, in the east to the town of H\u00e4ssleholm in the west and ends with the two horsts Linder\u00f6ds\u00e5sen and N\u00e4vlinge\u00e5sen in the south. The basin's northern boundary is more diffuse and there are several outlying portions of Cretaceous-age sediments. During the Cretaceous, the region was a shallow subtropical to temperate inland sea and archipelago. Though the sediments in the basin range in age from the Barremian to the earliest Maastrichtian, the only accessible strata are from the Late Cretaceous, ranging in age from the Early or early Middle Santonian to the earliest Maastrichtian. A majority of the fossil sites only expose strata of latest Early Campanian age ( 80 million years ago). Fossils from these sites have been collected since the 18th century, but most of the excavations have taken place through commercial quarrying in the 20th century and paleontological expeditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. The Early Campanian deposits of the Kristianstad Basin preserve fossils of a diverse array of organisms, including algae, brachiopods, bryozoans, molluscs (notably large numbers of bivalves and belemnites), sea urchins, fish (including a large amount of shark species). The Kristianstad Basin has also yielded fossils of several varieties of reptiles, including plesiosaurs, turtles and crocodylomorphs, as well as one of the most diverse mosasaur faunas in the world and the only non-avian dinosaurs known from Sweden. == Geology == === Geological background === Iv\u00f6 Klack and the surrounding landscape The Balsberget hill, where the Balsberg fossil site is located The Kristianstad Basin is located in northeastern Sk\u00e5ne, the southernmost province of Sweden, extending from Han\u00f6bukten, a bay in the Baltic Sea, in the east to the town of H\u00e4ssleholm in the west. The basement of the basin is crystalline and deeply weathered bedrock from the Precambrian. Most of this weathering, and the uneven topography of the basement, is due to the warm and moist climate experienced during the Jurassic or Early Cretaceous. The basement is overlaid by approximately 250 metres (820 feet) of mainly shallow water or marine sediments from the Cretaceous, ranging in age from the Barremian to the earliest Maastrichtian. In addition to the aquatic sediments, there are delta plain deposits of late Santonian to earliest Campanian age, overlaid by marine strata of latest Early Campanian age. The surface of the basement slopes to the south and is cut off by Linder\u00f6ds\u00e5sen and N\u00e4vlinge\u00e5sen, two horsts that mark the basin's south-western boundary. To the south-east, the basin's margin is marked by the Baltic Sea while the basin's northern margin is more diffuse, with several small outliers of Cretaceous-age sediments. During the Late Cretaceous, the basement of the basin was subjected to several regressions and transgressions. The sediments within the basin are dominated by fine- to coarse-grained sandy biocalcarenites (calcarenites that contain fossils) and more or less consolidated sandstones. Conglomeratic beds are also common, typically consisting of belemnite rostra or bivalve shells and coarse terrigenous clastic rocks. There are also several flint beds in the upper parts of the strata, dating to the early Late Campanian through the earliest Maastrichtian. Dominant sediment types from the Early Campanian are oyster banks, calcarenites and calcareous, glauconitic quartz sands. Accessible strata exposed in the basin range in age from Early or early Middle Santonian to earliest Maastrichtian. A majority of the fossil sites only expose strata of latest Early Campanian age ( 80 million years ago). With the sole exception of the Ugnsmunnarna site, which is the only large natural outcrop of Late Cretaceous strata in Sweden, the sites within the Kristianstad Basin are the result of commercial kaolin clay/limestone exploitation. Some of the belemnite species and belemnite biozones in the Kristianstad Basin, exhibited at \"Havsdrakarnas hus\" in Brom\u00f6lla, Sweden The biozones of the Kristianstad Basin, based on belemnite fossils, are: * Early to Middle Santonian: Gonioteuthis westfalica westfalica. *Late Middle Santonian: Gonioteuthis westfalicagranulata. *Late Santonian: Gonioteuthis granulata. *Earliest Campanian: Gonioteuthis granulaquadrata, alongside Actinocamax verus, Belemnellocamax grossouvrei and Belemnitella alpha. *Latest Early Campanian: Belemnellocamax mammillatus, alongside Belemnitella mucronata and Gonioteuthis quadrata scaniensis. This zone is exceptionally rich in vertebrate fossils and diversity. *Earliest Late Campanian: Belemnellocamax balsvikensis. *Early Late Campanian: Belemnitella mucronata. *Middle Late Campanian: also Belemnitella mucronata. *Late Late Campanian or earliest Maastrichtian: Belemnella lanceolata. === Prominent fossil sites === * Iv\u00f6 Klack, historically known as Blaksudden, an abandoned and partly overgrown limestone and kaolin quarry on the northern slope of the island Iv\u00f6. Iv\u00f6 Klack was once the shores of a small and rocky Cretaceous island and is one of the most extensively excavated sites in the basin, having been excavated since quarrying activities started in 1888. Though quarrying stopped in the late 1960s, the site continues to be excavated by paleontologists and amateurs. * Ugnsmunnarna, a partly overgrown cliff section located on the island Iv\u00f6, about three kilometers south of Iv\u00f6 Klack. The rocks at Ugnsmunnarna were deposited in a deeper-water part surrounding the Cretaceous Iv\u00f6 island. *Ignaberga, the Ignaberga site compromises two limestone quarries situated along the southern margin of the basin created by N\u00e4vlinge\u00e5sen. *Maltesholm, a now disused limestone quarry adjacent to the northern end of Linder\u00f6ds\u00e5sen. With the exception of abundant fragmentary invertebrate fossils, few other fossil remains have been found at Maltesholm. *\u00c5sen, an abandoned clay pit, presently used as a landfill. The topography of the basement rock, the presence of floodplain sediments and the recovery of fossil hybodont shark teeth suggests that the localion was near an ancient river system. One of the most extensively excavated sites in the basin. *Axeltorp, an abandoned and overgrown limestone quarry. *Balsberg, a natural cave located on the southwestern slope of the Balsberget hill. *Ivetofta, a drill core in the town of Brom\u00f6lla, the sediments penetrated are of latest Early Campanian age. *Kjuge, a natural cliff section located near the lake Iv\u00f6sj\u00f6n. *Ullstorp, a series of five small quarries (one of which remains active) close to N\u00e4vlinge\u00e5sen. *Balsvik, an overgrown quarry which in addition to Campanian rocks also exposes approximately three meters (9 ft) of earliest Maastrichtian strata. == History of study == Contemporary pencil drawing of Swedish physician and paleontologist Magnus Bromelius, who first discovered fossils in the Kristianstad Basin in 1725. The Kristianstad Basin is one of the most prolific and historically famous Mesozoic fossil sites in Scandinavia. The earliest known fossil discoveries within the basin were made by the physician and paleontologist Magnus Bromelius at Iv\u00f6 Klack and Ignaberga in 1725. Most of the early fossil finds were belemnite fossils, descriptions of which were published by physician and naturalist Kilian Stob\u00e6us in 1752 (whose work Opuscula included the first illustrations of the common Belemnellocamax mammillatus belemnites), naturalist G\u00f6ran Wahlenberg in 1821 and zoologist and archaeologist Sven Nilsson in 1826, 1827, 1835 and 1857. Early sedimentological studies were also conducted throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, prominently by paleontologist and geologist Bernhard Lundgren in 1888 and geologist Alf Lundegren in 1931 and 1934. The various limestone and kaolin quarries throughout the basin were described in detail by geologist and paleontologist Karl A. Gr\u00f6nwall in 1915, followed by further descriptions by Alf Lundegren in 1931, geologist Lars Bjerning in 1947, geologist Per H. Lundeg\u00e5rdh in 1971, geologists Jan Bergstr\u00f6m and Naz Ahmed Shaikh in 1980 and geologists Mikael Erlstr\u00f6m and Jan Gabrielson in 1985 and 1992. Throughout the 20th century, quarrying was most intense at \u00c5sen, Axeltorp and Iv\u00f6 Klack, most of it conducted by the companies H\u00f6gan\u00e4s keramik and If\u00f6-verken. Important historical studies conducted on the basin's many invertebrate taxa include those by Bernhard Lundgren (in 1876, 1885 and 1895), paleontologist J. Christian Moberg in 1884 and 1885, geologist Anders H. Hennig in 1892, 1894 and 1904 (together with paleontologist Alfred Elis T\u00f6rnebohm), geologist and mineralogist Assar Hadding in 1919, Bernhard Lundegren in 1934, paleontologist Gustaf Troedsson in 1946 and 1954, paleontologist Richard H\u00e4gg in 1954 and geologist and paleontologist Fritz Brotzen in 1960. Further studies on the invertebrate fauna, as with the more publicized vertebrate fossils, have continued into the 21st century. Actinopterygian (ray-finned) fishes were first described form the basin by Sven Nilsson in 1827, with further studies being conducted by paleontologist John W. Davis in 1890 and by paleontologist Mohamad Bazzi and colleagues in 2016. Though shark teeth have been recovered from the basin since early times, the shark and ray fauna was first studied in detail by paleontologist Mikael Siverson in the 20th century, who in a series of publications from 1989 to 2016, some together with other authors, identified a vast number of species. Marine reptile fossils, found at Ivetofta, were first described from the basin by Sven Nilsson in 1835. Nilsson's work was followed by further investigations by physicist and chemist Wilhelm Hisinger in 1837, archaeologist and bibliographer Johan Henrik Schr\u00f6der in 1885 and paleontologist Carl Wiman in 1916. Later studies on marine reptile fossils were also conducted by J. Christian Moberg in 1884 and 1885, Bernhard Lundgren in 1888, Anders H. Hennig in 1910, Alf Lundegren in 1934, Gustaf Troedsson in 1946 and 1954 and prominently in a series of publications of paleontologist Per-Ove Persson, who described several species of mosasaurs and plesiosaurs alongside sea turtles and the crocodylomorph Aigialosuchus, from 1954 to 1996. More recent work on marine reptiles has been conducted primarily by Mikael Siverson and paleontologist Johan Lindgren (especially on mosasaurs) and paleontologists Elisabeth Einarsson, Benjamin P. Kear, Sven Sachs and Torsten M. Scheyer (especially on plesiosaurs and sea turtles). Recent dinosaur discoveries, including both non-avian dinosaurs and hesperornithiform birds, have mainly been researched by Johan Lindgren and paleontologist Jan Rees alongside several colleagues. == Depositional environment and paleoecology == Tooth of the large mosasaur Tylosaurus ivoensis, believed to have been the basin's apex predator in the Campanian, exhibited at \"Havsdrakarnas hus\" in Brom\u00f6lla, Sweden During the transgressions experienced during the Late Cretaceous, the inland sea within the Kristianstad Basin remained very shallow, and its northern parts formed an archipelago with several low islands and a number of small peninsulas. The climate was subtropical to temperate and local plant life included low-growing flowering plants, ferns, conifers and deciduous trees. Most of the area preserved in the Kristianstad Basin was a shallow marine inner shelf environment, as indicated by the present invertebrate fauna (which has been compared to modern faunas). Most of the water was probably less than 40 meters (131 ft) deep, but there were a wide range of environments present. These environments included rocky and sandy beach areas, drowned river valleys and neritic and deeper offshore environments. There were shallow and protected coastal bays as well as coastal waters that were significantly deeper. Some structures within the rocks of the Basin, combined with the often fragmented and broken condition of the fossils recovered, indicates that the Cretaceous environment was a high-energy environment (one in which the water is fast-moving and agitated, created by waves and currents). During the Late Cretaceous, the Kristianstad region was home to a diverse marine fauna. The composition of the local fauna was characteristic of shallow marine life of an inner shelf community and included abundant algae, brachiopods, bryozoans, molluscs (including bivalves, gastropods, belemnites and the ammonites Baculites and Hauericeras), sea urchins, serpulids, decapods (such as Protocallianassa) and sponges. Additionally, fish (including a vast array of sharks) were also common and fossils of many species of reptiles, most of them marine, have also been found, including mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sea turtles, crocodylmorphs and a few dinosaurs. === Shorelines of Iv\u00f6 Klack === Reconstruction of the large shark Cretoxyrhina attacking a Pteranodon pterosaur. Fossils of both Cretoxyrhina and pterosaurs have been recovered from the Kristianstad Basin. Iv\u00f6 Klack was a small island during the Campanian. Teeth from large lamniform sharks, such as Cretoxyrhina mantelli and Cretalamna appendiculata, are significantly more common at Iv\u00f6 Klack than they are in other sites, such as Ignaberga. The prominence of large sharks in the area probably derives from large sharks requiring large prey, and large marine reptiles being common at Iv\u00f6 Klack as well. There are plesiosaur fossils from Iv\u00f6 Klack with shark bite marks. Modern great white sharks are known to patrol around small islands inhabited by seals, possibly a behavior also present in the similar Cretoxyrhina. Iv\u00f6 Klack is the only site where fossils of hesperornithiforms, a group of aquatic birds, are present. Fossil remains of large marine reptiles are also especially common at Iv\u00f6 Klack. The high diversity of sharks and mosasaurs recovered at Iv\u00f6 Klack shows that large predators frequented the rocky coastline. There must have been a productive ecosystem, with a diverse invertebrate fauna attracting small nektonic predators (such as cephalopods and fish), which then in turn attracted larger predators. It is probable that the richness of the environment also made Iv\u00f6 Klack a nursery and feeding ground for migratory species, similar to rocky shores today. The discovery of the basin's only crocodylomorph at Iv\u00f6 Klack might indicate that Aigialosuchus preferred to live in coastal waters, where it could lay its egg on adjacent land, rest and heat up, similar to modern crocodilians. === Murky waters of \u00c5sen === Reconstruction of three Clidastes mosasaurs in shallow water. Young Clidastes have been found at \u00c5sen, likely using the shallow and murky water there as protection against larger predators. The \u00c5sen site is believed to have been a murky river mouth during the Campanian. Teeth and vertebrae of small-sized (probably juvenile) Clidastes propython mosasaurs have been found at \u00c5sen, which suggests that the area offered some protection against predation by larger mosasaurs and other predators, possibly due to the murky waters produced by some nearby river system. This murky setting also seems to have been preferred by the many species of benthic sharks and rays recovered at \u00c5sen. Particularly, Rays significantly more common at \u00c5sen than elsewhere. It is probable that they preferred the murky and estuarine environment there, similar to the environments preferred by their modern relatives. The sharks and rays at \u00c5sen probably fed on fish and invertebrates, which occur with less diversity (though still large numbers) at \u00c5sen than elsewhere. They might have primarily fed on soft-bodied invertebrates, less likely to be preserved in the fossil record. === Terrestrial life === Map of Europe, with important fossil deposits, during the Late Cretaceous (Santonian\u2013Maastrichtian). Most of Sweden was part of an isolated northern landmass. The few fragmentary dinosaur fossils recovered in the Kristianstad Basin represent the remains of specimens transported out into the sea during floods or storms. Despite being fragmentary, they add to our understanding of the as of yet poorly known dinosaur fauna of the Baltic Shield, which was an isolated landmass during the Late Cretaceous. It is also possible that the recovered dinosaurs were not from the landmass itself, but from the rocky islands of the adjacent archipelago in the Kristianstad Basin itself. Dinosaur fossils recovered from the Kristianstad Basin can be confidently attributed to theropod, ornithopod and leptoceratopsid dinosaurs. The recovered dinosaurs all represent animals with lengths less than three meters (9 ft), but this does not necessarily mean that larger dinosaurs were absent; it is equally likely that only small animals were transported out into the sea where they could be fossilized and preserved. When large dinosaurs are excluded, the dinosaur fauna preserved in the Kristianstad Basin resembles that of Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian dinosaur- bearing formations in Canada, which also include small ornithopods (such as Parksosaurus) and leptoceratopsids (such as Unescoceratops). Fossil wood has been recovered from late Middle Santonian to earliest Campanian-age deposits at \u00c5sen, representing the tree genera Pinus, Platanus, Scandianthus, Silvianthemum and Actinocalyx. == Vertebrate fossil content == === Fish === ==== Sharks ==== A majority of the sharks in the Kristianstad Basin were lamniforms and they were either nectonic (swimming freely in the body of water) or nectobenthic (active just above the sea floor). The lamniform shark fauna in the basin represents the most diverse Late Cretaceous lamniform fauna yet discovered. The most common genus of shark found is Carcharias. All shark species found in the Kristianstad Basin were active predators, but many of them only fed on smaller food items such as bony fish and various invertebrates. Large nektonic species, such as Squalicorax kaupi and Cretoxyrhina mantelli, presumably occupied the top of the food web. Bite marks from sharks are relatively common on reptile bones in the Kristianstad Basin. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | Sharks reported from the Kristianstad Basin |- !

The mosasaurs were large, carnivorous reptiles at the top of the food chain and since all the Campanian species are known from several sites, it is likely that all of them lived in the entire basin. The most common mosasaurs were the smaller- sized Clidastes and Eonatator. The high diversity of mosasaurs in the basin can be explained by the dissimilarity in dentition and body size between the species, meaning that they would not have competed with each other for food. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |Mosasaurs reported from the Kristianstad Basin |- !

Because plesiosaurs are found in all the different environments thought to have existed in the Kristianstad Basin, they are believed to have been present in the entire basin. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Plesiosaurs reported from the Kristianstad Basin |- !

In addition to the fossils described below, indeterminate turtle remains, including limb bones and carapace fragments, have also been recovered from Iv\u00f6 Klack, Ugnsmunnarna, Ignaberga and \u00c5sen. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Turtles reported from the Kristianstad Basin |- !

The only other certain traces of dinosaurs in Sweden are footprints of Late Triassic/Early Jurassic age in northwestern Sk\u00e5ne, made by theropods (Eubrontes giganteus and Kayentapus soltykovensis) and thyreophorans. Though theropod teeth were reported from Iv\u00f6 Klack by Per-Ove Persson in the 1950s, these have since been identified as fish teeth, probably from the genus Protosphyraena. Fossil material conclusively identified as dinosaurian was recovered only relatively recently, with material referred to a leptoceratopsid being described in 2007 and further fragmentary fossils of other groups being recovered during excavations from 2010 to 2013. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Non-avian dinosaurs reported from the Kristianstad Basin |- !
