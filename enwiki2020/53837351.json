    "text": "Elisha Wiesel (born June 6, 1972) is an American businessman. He worked for Goldman Sachs for a quarter of a century, serving as its Chief Information Officer for three years, until December 2019. He is the only child of Holocaust survivor, author, professor, and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elie Wiesel. ==Early and personal life== Elisha Wiesel was born June 6, 1972. He was named Shlomo Elisha, after his paternal grandfather, Shlomo, who died at age 50 after a death march to the Buchenwald concentration camp. At his bris, the rabbi said: \"A name has returned.\"Samuel G. Freedman (October 23, 1983). \"Bearing Witness,\" The New York Times. His father, Elie Wiesel, was a Holocaust survivor, author, professor, activist, and Nobel Peace Prize recipient of Hungarian Jewish and Romanian Jewish descent, whose hometown was Sighet, Romania. His mother, Marion Erster Rose Wiesel, is a Holocaust survivor born in Vienna, Austria, of Austrian Jewish descent, and translator. His paternal grandmother and his father's younger sister were killed in the gas chambers in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He was raised on the Upper West Side and Upper East Side in Manhattan in New York City, attending Modern Orthodox yeshiva Ramaz on the Upper East Side, and suburban New Jersey. When he was six years old, Wiesel and his family lived in Israel for a few months. His parents spoke French at home. As a teenager he moved from computer programming of computer games to electric guitar, interested in heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Metallica, but also in the punk band The Ramones. Wiesel then attended Yale University, graduating with a B.S. in computer science in 1994. At one point in his freshman year he sported a purple mohawk haircut. After graduating from Yale, he spent a few months doing basic military training in Israel. Wiesel and his wife Lynn Bartner-Wiesel have two children: a son, Elijah, and a daughter, Shira. ==Career== Wiesel joined the J. Aron commodities division of Goldman Sachs in 1994, after the head of J. Aron strats (the code-writers whose computer models and algorithms power the firm's trading desks) convinced him to give up his initial preference of working in the video game industry.Liz Hoffman (January 10, 2017). \"Goldman Sachs names new tech chief,\" Financial News. At the time, technology was in its earliest days in banking.Laura Noonan (September 4, 2019). \"Goldman Sachs braced for more top-level changes,\" The Financial Times. At Goldman he worked for Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn, who ended up leading the firm. One day Blankfein criticized him in the lobby of Goldman's headquarters as he arrived on rollerblades, saying: \"I\u2019m invested in that head, get a helmet!\" He became a managing director in 2002, and a partner in 2004. Wiesel later served as the Chief Risk Officer of its securities division (which houses Goldman's technology-intensive trading business), and global head of its securities division desk strategists.Liz Hoffman (January 10, 2017). \"Goldman Sachs Names New Tech Guru,\" The Wall Street Journal. In January 2017, when he was 44 years old, he succeeded R. Martin Chavez as Goldman's chief information officer, overseeing Engineering (the firm's Technology Division and global strategists groups). Wiesel became the highest- ranked of 9,000 Goldman engineers, who accounted for 25% of the firm's total employees. In July 2017, Institutional Investor named him # 10 in the \"2017 Tech 40.\" In December 2019 Wiesel left Goldman Sachs after a 25-year career at the firm. As he considers his next move, he said he was interested in the intersection of philanthropy and engineering and was ready to move on from banking. He was considering options that included traveling the world, computer games, and teaching, while intrigued by the health care company that Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Jamie Dimon were building, and committed to spending more time working on matters relating to his father such as deciding on the disposition of his papers. He volunteered on Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign and began an archive of his father's writings. He became a board member of the Zioness organization. ==Philanthropy == Wiesel organized fundraisers for Good Shepherd Services, a Brooklyn-based after- school program charity that provides support for at-risk youths and their families, at Goldman beginning in 2013.\"HHREC Annual Dinner to Feature Elisha Wiesel,\" The Jewish Link, October 18, 2018. He also became well-known for organizing the popular all-night Midnight Madness problem-solving scavenger hunt throughout New York City, popular among Wall Street professionals. It has raised millions of dollars for charitable non-profits.Olivia Oran (January 9, 2017). \"Goldman names Elisha Wiesel as new chief information officer,\" Reuters.Susanna Kim (June 28, 2013). \"Goldman Sachs' 'Madness' Scavenger Hunt Accepting Applications at $50K+ Per Team,\" ABC News. ==Political activity== At a November 30, 2016, event at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Wiesel spoke of the need to protect the LGBT community and Israel, which he said was \"treated as the world villain simply for making sure that Jews will never again be without a home,\" and criticized president-elect Donald Trump's policies. At another event held at the Museum of Jewish Heritage on January 29, 2017, he suggested that protesting against Executive Order 13769 (\"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\") was part of his father's legacy. In April 2017, in a speech to the March of the Living program at Auschwitz for Holocaust Remembrance Day, he said that the United States and European countries had not learned the lessons of the Holocaust, because many in those countries had turned away Syrian refugees fleeing chemical warfare. Wiesel added: \"Will you stand by when African- Americans have reason to be terrified of a routine traffic stop, when Christians are slaughtered in Egypt because they are labelled infidels, when girls in Chad, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are threatened, raped, or shot for pursuing an education, when homosexuality in Iran is a crime that carries the death penalty?\"Naomi Zeveloff (April 25, 2017). \"Elie Wiesel's Son; Holocaust Lessons Unheeded in Syria Disaster,\" The Forward.Elisha Wiesel (April 24, 2017). \"Elisha Wiesel\u2019s speech urges Jews not to be silent observers of injustice,\" The Canadian Jewish NewsElisha Wiesel (April 25, 2017). \"My father was a witness, and now I will be a witness (op-ed),\" Ynet. ==References== ==External links== *Elisha Wiesel (June 8, 2017). \"Lessons from my Father,\" Jewish Week. *\"A conversation between Elisha Wiesel, Chief Information Officer, Goldman Sachs and David Gurl\u00e9,\" Symphony Innovate 2017, October 10, 2017 (video). *Elisha Wiesel (November 5, 2017). \"Answering the Call of My Father, Elie Wiesel\" (opinion),\" Algemeiner. *Elisha Wiesel (October 29, 2018). \"How to Respond to the Unspeakable Tragedy in Pittsburgh\" (opinion),\" Algemeiner. *Elisha Wiesel (May 6, 2019). \"After Poway, We Must Unite and Stop the Hatred (opinion),\" Algemeiner. *Elisha Wiesel (November 10, 2019). \"Scrapping the \u2018Dreamers\u2019 programme should be ruled unlawful (opinion),\" Financial Times.
