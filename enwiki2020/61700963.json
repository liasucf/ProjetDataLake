    "text": "The Serenade for flute, violin and viola, Op. 25, is a chamber composition by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is in the key of D major ==Composition== The serenade was written by Beethoven around 1801, though there are preliminary sketches from 1797 when Beethoven finished his earlier serenade Op. 8. The work was definitely finished by late 1801 when Beethoven offered it the publisher G. Cappi. In 1803, arranged the serenade for flute (or violin) and piano. Beethoven checked and approved this arrangement and it was printed as his Op. 41. Similar to his Septet of the same period, the work had great popular appeal and was profitable for the young composer. ==Structure== The work consists of six movements: #Entrata, Allegro #Tempo ordinario d'un Menuetto #Allegro molto #Andante con Variazioni #Allegro scherzando e vivace #Adagio \u2013 Allegro vivace e disinvolto ==Notes== ==External Links== * Category:Compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven Category:1801 compositions Category:Chamber music by Ludwig van Beethoven Category:Compositions for flute Category:Compositions for viola Category:Compositions in D major ",
