The station is owned by High Desert Broadcasting. ==History== The station first signed on May 22, 1999 as KCEL (106.9 K-Cell). Owned by Kathryn J. Efford, it aired a variety format focusing on jazz, country music, and oldies. KCEL hosted many local specialty shows from its studios in California City, California, including one on Wednesday evenings that showcased rock music. In September 2003, KCEL switched to a full-time oldies format. This lasted until the following month, when Efford sold the station to High Desert Broadcasting for $500,000. The new owner then flipped KCEL to a regional Mexican format. On January 1, 2009, KCEL swapped frequencies with sister station KMVE on 96.1 FM. With the move, 106.9 FM assumed the KMVE call letters and began airing a classic hits format now branded as \"Classic Top 40 106.9\". In 2011, High Desert Broadcasting assigned KMVE to Mojave Radio LLC, owned by Keith Yokomoto, for $100. The station retained the classic hits format. as of June 2019, High Desert Broadcasting Dropped KMVE classic hits format and switched 106.9 to a simulcast of KGMX 106.3 ==References== ==External links== * MVE Category:Classic hits radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1997 Category:California City, California ",
