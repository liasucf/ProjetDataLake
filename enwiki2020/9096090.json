    "text": "right The International Centre for Democratic Transition (ICDT) is a non- profit organization based in Budapest, Hungary which collects the experiences of recent democratic transitions and shares them with those who are determined to follow that same path. Instead of promoting democracy in general, the ICDT sets more concrete and pragmatic goals. The Centre strives to show how dozens of young democracies have made and are making the transition, so that those who set off on this difficult journey from dictatorship to democracy in the future may learn from the successes as well as from the failures. It was founded in 2005. ==Mission statement== Because the International Centre for Democratic Transition was founded in Central Europe, we are acutely aware of the complexity of democratic transition as a process. We ourselves have recently undergone this process and know full well the fragility of new democracies. We firmly believe that a transition can only be judged to be successful when the benefits of democracy are shared by the whole of society. The ICDT\u2019s mission is to facilitate the smooth and peaceful process of democratic transition on the basis of participatory principles; the political, economic, legal, cultural, and civil societal aspects of transformation; and the socio-cultural context of regions and countries where the process takes place. ==History== The idea to establish an institute to collect and share the experiences of past democratic transitions originated from former US Ambassador Mark Palmer, Vice President of the Council for a Community of Democracies (CCD). His proposal was followed by a meeting between the Hungarian Foreign Minister L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs and the US Secretary of State in June 2004. At a conference in Budapest in March 2005 civil society and governmental leaders from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States, as well as representatives of a number of international organizations approved the concept paper on the new Centre. Subsequently, the idea was presented by the Hungarian Foreign Minister at the Third Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in Santiago de Chile. Once again, the idea was well received and endorsed by the participating Foreign Ministers, representing more than 100 democratic governments of the world. Finally, in September 2005, the President of Hungary announced at the World Summit of the United Nations that \"an International Centre for Democratic Transition (ICDT) has been set up in Budapest.\" ==Operational Method== The ICDT: * facilitates the process of democratic transition by using the knowledge pool of transitional experiences and by sharing best practices; * convenes the most important indigenous stakeholders to play key roles in the transition process; * provides an adaptable toolbox and appropriate models for the creation and consolidation of democratic institutions; * mediates between cultures and regions by generating dialogue. ==Key Achievements== * Pursued 23 distinct projects to promote democratic transition and share best practices and lessons learned; * Established a strong presence in Moldova with a series of high-profile projects; * Celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1989 democratic changes in a dignified way, with a number of conferences and high-level events; * Reached out to over a thousand members of civil society, government officials, and media representatives; * Earned the trust of new donors including the Governments of Estonia, Switzerland, and Luxembourg; * Established a long-term partnership with the Helen Bader Foundation; * Achieved broad international recognition with the publication of A European Alternative for Belarus: Report of the Belarus Task Force; * Published an Open Letter to the Obama Administration, which attracted international attention and debate; * Enlisted Paula J.
