    "text": "City Hall. The Edmonton City Council is the governing body of the City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Edmonton currently has one mayor and 12 city councillors. Elections are held every four years. The most recent was held in 2017, and the next is in 2021. The mayor is elected across the whole city, through the First Past the Post plurality voting system. Councillors are elected one per ward, a division of the city, through the First Past the Post plurality voting system. On July 22, 2009, City Council voted to change the electoral system of six wards to a system of 12 wards; each represented by a single councillor. The changes took effect in the 2010 election. In the 2010 election, Edmonton was divided into 12 wards each electing one councillor. Before that system was adopted in 1980, the city at different times used a variety of different electoral systems for the election of its councillors: two different systems of wards, one using FPTP, the other Block Voting systems; at-large elections with Block Voting; and at-large elections using Single Transferable Voting (when Alternative Voting was used to elect mayors). In May 2019, Edmonton\u2019s Ward Boundary Commission began reviewing the city\u2019s current boundary system. The findings will be reported to the City Council in May 2020, and any changes will be implemented after the 2021 municipal election. ==Current membership== City Council's current membership was elected in 2017 and will serve until the 2021 election. * Don Iveson - Mayor of Edmonton * Andrew Knack - Ward 1 (West Edmonton, Meadowlark, Jasper Place) * Bev Esslinger - Ward 2 (Northwest Edmonton, Calder, Griesbach) * Jon Dziadyk - Ward 3 (Castle Downs, Eaux Claires) * Aaron Paquette - Ward 4 (Northeast Edmonton, Manning, Clareview) * Sarah Hamilton - Ward 5 (Callingwood Park, Riverview, Glastonbury) * Scott McKeen - Ward 6 (Central Edmonton, Glenora) * Tony Caterina - Ward 7 (East Edmonton, Beverly, Highlands, Norwood) * Ben Henderson - Ward 8 (Strathcona, Gold Bar) * Tim Cartmell - Ward 9 (Southwest Edmonton, Riverbend, Whitemud) * Michael Walters - Ward 10 (Southgate) * Mike Nickel - Ward 11 (Mill Woods) * Mohinder Banga - Ward 12 (Southeast Edmonton, Mill Creek, Ellerslie) ==Past Councils== ===Since 2010=== In 2010, Edmonton adopted a ward system in which one councillor was elected from each of twelve wards. The mayor was elected from the city at-large. In 2010, council was elected to serve three years. In 2013 and 2017 they were elected to serve for four years. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected !

These wards were more organic than the previous four-ward system. The mayor was elected at-large. Those elected served for three years. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! Ward 1 !

Each ward was a north-south slice of the city so each contained territories on both sides of the river. Still the mayor and the councillors were to serve for three years. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Like the 1966 election the mayor and all the city councillors were up for election, councillors elected at large through Block Voting. But unlike 1968 they were to serve for three years. In 1968 Alberta's legislation had been changed to require elections every three years in all of the province's municipalities. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! Aldermen !

As well Edmonton unstaggered its terms for city officials, meaning that all the council seats would be up for election each election, held every two years. In preparation for this, in 1964 the mayor and all aldermanic positions up for re-election were elected to one-year terms. All alderman continued to be elected at-large through block voting. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! Aldermen ! Notes |- | 1966 | Vincent M.

The council continued to be elected at-large to staggered two-year terms until 1963, when the council seats up for election were filled just for one year (to prepare for the change in 1964 to all seats being up for election each election. From 1912 to 1960, seats were guaranteed to southsiders. The guaranteed representation for the southside was cancelled after a 1960 referendum. (But in 1971 with the introduction of wards altogether south of the river, southside representation was re-established.) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! North side ! South side !

Aldermen continued to be elected on staggered two-year terms, but the mayor was elected for a one- year term. There was still guaranteed minimum representation for the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. This number increased over time. It was two until 1936, and three thereafter. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! North side ! South side !

The effect was that no one party took all the seats up for election. Alternative Voting was used to elect mayors to ensure that the successful candidate had to have a majority of the votes to win (but no transfer took place if only two candidates ran for the post or if one candidate took a majority on the first count). The southside still had guaranteed representation, of at least two councillors. The mayor continued to be elected annually, and aldermen continued to be elected to staggered two- year terms. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year Elected ! Mayor ! North side ! South side !

(Wards were not established, but at least two southsiders had to be elected.)
