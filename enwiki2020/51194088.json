He is W. J. A. Power Professor of Biblical Hebrew and Old Testament and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. Nelson studied at Capital University, Trinity Lutheran Seminary, and Union Theological Seminary in Virginia. Prior to coming to Perkins, he served as a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and then as Assistant Professor of Religion at Ferrum College and Kraft Professor of Biblical Studies at Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. Nelson has written commentaries on Deuteronomy, Joshua, and the Book of Kings. In 2010, a Festschrift was published in his honor: Raising Up a Faithful Exegete: Essays in Honor of Richard D. Nelson, which included contributions from Niels Peter Lemche, Kurt Noll, and Ralph W. Klein. In 2014 he published Historical Roots of the Old Testament (1200\u201363 BCE) (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature Press) in which he listed some of the most important extra-biblical sources relevant for a scholarly study of the Old Testament. Nelson was a student of historian John Bright (1908\u20131995), and was influenced by him in methodological approach to Old Testament study. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:20th- century Christian biblical scholars Category:20th-century Lutheran clergy Category:21st-century American male writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century Christian biblical scholars Category:21st-century Lutheran clergy Category:American academic administrators Category:American biblical scholars Category:American Lutheran clergy Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Bible commentators Category:Capital University alumni Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Christians Category:Ferrum College Category:Living people Category:Lutheran biblical scholars Category:Old Testament scholars Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Southern Methodist University faculty Category:Union Presbyterian Seminary alumni ",
