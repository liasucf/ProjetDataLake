    "text": "The Honda HSC (Honda Sports Concept) is a concept sports car that was initially unveiled at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show. Most of the automotive media immediately speculated that it was designed to be a replacement for the Honda NSX, although this was never confirmed by Honda. It was also branded as an Acura. The HSC featured a lightweight, mid-mounted aluminum i-VTEC V6 engine with a 6-speed transmission controlled by either an F1-style paddle shifter on the steering wheel or a unique dial shifter on the center console. When shifted into reverse, the navigation system's adjustable flat-panel screen in the center console becomes a display for a rear-mounted camera. Abundant leather and aluminum trim pieces round out the interior, an all-aluminum frame with carbon fibre body panels keep it light, and swan doors affirm its sports car status. The development of this car into a production sports car appeared to stall for two years. However, the July 2005 announcement by Honda CEO Takeo Fukui indicated the HSC was only a test concept for a pure sports car. In 2009, a road car version of the Honda HSV-010 GT was seen. The similarity of the Honda HSV road car prototype and the Honda HSC concept is undeniable. For example, the names, \"HSC\" and \"HSV\" have a one-letter difference. The HSV-010 GT was purely for racing, and was supposed to be an NSX successor. The HSC was also supposed to be the new NSX. If we take a look between the two cars, the HSV and HSC, the styling looks stylishly similar. For example, the front of the Honda HSV has a sleek-looking grille, with an aerodynamic front. The HSC's front also has a sleek-looking front panel and has an aerodynamic entry. Apart from this, there is almost no evidence of Honda intentionally styling the HSV to look similar to the HSC. The only thing we know is the name. ==References== https://drivetribe.com/p/honda-hsc-the-nearly-nsx- Ak2rowNASqScORScX9Oulw?iid=bn9NGZI6QAysZJfko0FksA HSC ",
