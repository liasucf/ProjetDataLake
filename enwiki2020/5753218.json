A. Macartney, The Magyars in the Ninth Century (Cambridge University Press, 1930), p. 138n. Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107 called the Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani \"Dacian-Slavic tribes\" (da\u010dko-slovenska plemena) and considered them as Serbs. They were conquered by the Bulgarian Khan Krum in 805 AD together with the Timo\u010dani and Obodrites. The Khan annexed the territories that would serve as a frontier to Rascia and the Franks, he replaced their leaders with Bulgarian administrators. In 818 during the rule of Omurtag (814-836) Brani\u010devci, together with other tribes of the frontier, revolted because of an administrative reform that deprived them of much of their local authority and seceded from Bulgaria. They came under Frankish rule in 822. Timok and Branicevo would be of dispute between the Franks and Bulgars, the Khan sent embassies in 824 and 826 seeking to settle the border dispute, but was neglected. Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159ik connected them to the Praedenecenti mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals in 822\u2013824.John Van Antwerp Fine, When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans (University of Michigan Press, 2006), p. 35. ==References== Category:South Slavic tribes Category:History of the Serbs Category:9th century in Serbia Category:First Bulgarian Empire ",
