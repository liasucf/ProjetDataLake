    "text": "The IEEE International Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH) is a conference in the area of computer arithmetic. ARITH Symposium Website The symposium was established in 1969, initially as three-year event, then as a biennial event, and, finally, from 2015 as an annual symposium. ARITH topics span from theoretical aspects and algorithms for operations, to hardware implementations of arithmetic units and applications of computer arithmetic. ARITH symposia are sponsored by IEEE Computer Society. They have been described as one of \"the most prestigious forums for computer arithmetic\" by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as the main conference forum for new research publications in computer arithmetic by ,; see in particular the final paragraph. and as a forum for interacting with the \"international community of arithmeticians\" by participants Peter Kornerup and David W.
