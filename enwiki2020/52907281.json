    "text": "The Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Thoronto (Toronto Gaelic Society) began to meet in 1880 and was formally established in 1887. Its primary purpose was to give assistance to immigrants from the G\u00e0idhealtachd, but it also aimed to preserve the Scottish Gaelic language and culture. Through the years, as the country itself established a social safety net and more benefits, the society took on a cultural role, preserving Gaelic traditions such as c\u00e8ilidhs. As its membership aged, the club began to wane and finally ended at the end of the 1980s. It was revived in 2012, however, by young learners interested in the language. == External links == * Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Thoronto website * Aiseirigh Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Thoronto - by Zachary Wallace, in the magazine D\u00e0na, November 2015 * Oighrig McKeogh talking about the revival of the Comunn G\u00e0idhlig Thoronto (Youtube).
