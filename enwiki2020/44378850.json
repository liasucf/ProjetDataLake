By 1912, the African-American community had eight orders - including the Gospel Pilgrims - with a total of 29 lodges in Athens, Georgia. The membership of these lodges totaled about 2,500 people that year, \"or about 75 percent of the adult black population of Athens\".Thurmond, 2000, 44 The origin of the name, \"Gospel Pilgrim\", is unknown.Hester, February 2004, 11Hester, Fall 2004, 36 ==Cemetery== In 1882, the Gospel Pilgrim Society purchased 8.25 acres from the estate of William P. Talmadge. He was a white blacksmith; his widow and executrix, Elizabeth Talmadge sold the property for $238.50. The deed lists the probably illiterate laborer, Green Bullock, as the president of the society at the time of the sale. In 1902, the society purchased an additional 0.75 acres from George P. Brightwell. Finally, in 1905, a 100'x60' parcel was transferred to neighboring Springfield Baptist Church to give the cemetery its current dimensions, bordering Fourth Street and what is now the Seaboard Airline Railway.Hester, February 2004, 14Hester, Fall 2004, 33-36 A 2004 survey found the acreage to be 10.071 acres, slightly larger than given in the deeds.NRHP form The earliest burials date from 1885, and most of those are from the family of Monroe B.
