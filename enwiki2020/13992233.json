    "text": "The Blacksmith is a 1922 American short comedy film co-written, co-directed by and featuring Buster Keaton. Buster plays an assistant blacksmith to the big worker played by Joe Roberts, with predictable results. ==Cast== Buster Keaton hoists a Model T engine from a wrecked car as Virginia Fox flirts with an unidentified actor in a scene still for the 1922 comedy short The Blacksmith. * Buster Keaton as Blacksmith's assistant * Joe Roberts as Blacksmith * Virginia Fox as Horsewoman ==Alternate versions== In June 2013, Argentine film collector, curator and historian Fernando Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a (who had previously unearthed the complete version of Metropolis) discovered an alternate version of this film, a sort of remake whose last reel differs completely from the previously known version. Film historians have since found evidence that the version of The Blacksmith Pe\u00f1a uncovered was a substantial reshoot undertaken months after completion of principal photography and a preview screening in New York. They now believe the rediscovered version was Keaton's final cut intended for wide distribution. Following Pe\u00f1a's discovery, a third version of the film, featuring at least one scene which doesn't occur in either of the other two, was found in the collection of former film distributor Blackhawk Films. ==See also== * Buster Keaton filmography ==References== ==External links== * * * The Blacksmith at the International Buster Keaton Society Category:1922 films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Buster Keaton Category:Films directed by Malcolm St. Clair Category:American silent short films Category:1922 short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:First National Pictures films Category:Films produced by Joseph M.
