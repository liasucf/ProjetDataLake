They later reaffirmed this in an interview with XXL in April 2017. The recording for I Want to Die in New Orleans began in 2016 whilst the duo were on tour. == Music and lyrics == I Want to Die in New Orleans was released on September 7, 2018 and is 14 tracks long with its last song, I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel (IV), acting as the fourth iteration of the duo's popular EP series of the same name. The project chronicles semi- autobiographical stories of the duo's encounters with depression, drug addiction and suicidal ideation. The instrumentals used are often ominous, dark but clean and feature samples from news adverts, local PSAs and documentaries taken in the New Orleans area in the late 90s as a way to attempt to create an atmospheric feel. The project only has one feature on \"Fuck the Industry\", which is uncredited, but involves rapper Bones speaking a mock eulogy. All tracks are produced by Suicideboys member $crim, under his producer alias Budd Dwyer. I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel (IV) contains a guitar interlude by fellow Suicideboys member Ruby da Cherry, and Phantom Menace was co-produced by Memphis rapper and mentor Juicy J. == Critical reception == HipHopDX gave the album a rating of 3.9 out of 5, commenting \"...have they actually changed the world of music itself? It\u2019s possible to chalk it up top typical artist bravado, but after yet another well-received release, they certainly have the evidence to argue their case.\" == Commercial performance == Released to critical acclaim in the underground rap scene, the album debuted at number 9 on the US Billboard 200 with 49,000 units in its first week sales making it their first US top 10 album.https://www.billboard.com/music/Suicideboys/chart-history/billboard-200 The album also reached the top 10 in Australia and Finland. == Track listing == Sample Credits * \u201dComa\u201d contains samples of \u201cMuch Better Off\u201d by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, \u201cKreepin\u2019 Out Da Kut\u201d by Playa Fly, and \u201cFall Off Me Ho\u201d by Indo G * \u201cKing Tulip\u201d contains a sample of \u201cCuesta Blanca\u201d by Grupo Encuentro * \u201c10,000 Degrees\u201d contains a sample from \u201cThinkin\u2019 of a Driveby\u201d by Gimisum Family * \u201cI No Longer Fear The Razor (IV)\u201d contains a sample of \u201cNine To Your Dome\u201d by Three 6 Mafia == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 15 |- |- |- |- |} == References == Category:2018 debut albums Category:Suicideboys albums ",
