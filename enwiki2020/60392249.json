He has crew chiefed in NASCAR since 2000, and has been an owner in NASCAR since 2018. ==Crew chiefing== ===Sprint Cup Series=== Lane started crew chiefing in 2000 in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series with Jeremy Mayfield scoring a strong 2nd-place finish at Phoenix Raceway, he caught the attention of Kyle Petty however after the 2nd with Mayfield he would go into a slump not scoring another top ten in the Cup Series till 2006 at Watkins Glen International with Scott Pruett. After that he would bounce to the drivers of the No. 40 at Chip Ganassi Racing scoring a best finish of 8th at Talladega with David Stremme. In 2009 he would jump to new team Front Row Motorsports with John Andretti in the No. 34 scoring a beat finish of 16th at Loudon. He would then jump ship once again to Robby Gordon Motorsports in 2011 scoring a best finish of 16th at Daytona in July with Robby Gordon. Halfway through the 2011 season he would leave Robby Gordon Motorsports and join Swan Racing (then Inception Motorsports) where he would stay till 2014 having one top 15 with David Stremme at Talladega where they would finish 12th. He would have one last race with Swan in Swan's final race at Richmond Raceway with J.J. Yeley finishing 40th. Steven would follow J.J. to Team Xtreme Racing and stay till midway through 2014 after poor performance from Yeley where their best finish was a 34th.

Yeley where they would finish 20th. In a shock to everyone the next race at Kentucky with the combination of Lane and Yeley they would win the pole and finish 18th, this would lead JGL to put Lane in the car with Yeley for the rest of the season where they would rack up 14 top 20's and 4 top 15's. In 2016 Yeley split from JGL leaving Lane at JGL with new driver Dakoda Armstrong, they performed on a decent level but would split for 4 races however partner backup midway through at Pocono and finish 18th, this led JGL to partner them back up after Iowa for the rest of the season except for the races Dakoda was in with Joe Gibbs Racing in the No. 18, they would rack up 15 top 20's and 3 top 15's. In 2017 he and Armstrong were slated for a full season where they would score 2 top 10's and two top 5's while also scoring his first top 5 since the year 2000 in his Cup debut with Jeremy Mayfield at Phoenix and would score a best finish of 3rd place at Daytona. They split up after Dakoda barely missed the playoffs, He would bounce back to the No. 24 car for JGL with Corey LaJoie and Dylan Lupton where he would score 4 top 20's and 2 top 15's.
