Her paternal grandmother, Princess Mukushen, was Nurhaci's daughter, which would make the Kangxi Emperor and Noble Consort Wenxi second cousins. When she died in 1694, her younger brother, Alingga, represented her family in mourning. * Father: Ebilun (d. 1673), served as one of the Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor, and held the title of a first class duke () ** Paternal grandfather: Eidu (1562\u20131621) ** Paternal grandmother: Aisin Gioro Mukushen (; 1595\u20131659), Nurhaci's fourth daughter * Mother: Lady \u0160u\u0161u Gioro * Seven brothers ** Seventh younger brother: Alingga (1670\u20131716) * Two elder sisters and three younger sisters ** Second elder sister: Empress Xiaozhaoren (1653 \u2013 18 March 1678) ===Kangxi era=== It is not known when Lady Niohuru entered the Forbidden City and became a mistress of the Kangxi Emperor. She was first mentioned in official histories on 28 January 1682 when the Kangxi Emperor granted ranks and titles to his consorts. She was granted the title \"Noble Consort\". As she was the only one among the emperor's consorts to hold that rank, she did not receive a title to distinguish her from the other consorts. She gave birth on 28 November 1683 to the emperor's tenth son, Yun'e, and on 24 October 1685 to his 11th daughter, who would die prematurely in June or July 1686. On 17 December 1694, Lady Niohuru became critically ill. She died two days later and was interred in the Jing Mausoleum of the Eastern Qing tombs.
