The title role in Claudio Monteverdi's opera L'Arianna was written for Martinelli, but she died prior to its premier. ==Life== Martinelli was born in Rome in 1589. In 1603, she came to Mantua at the request of Duke Vincenzo, who originally intended for her to be trained in Florence first but later changed his mind.Strainchamps 159 After arriving in Mantua, she lived in Monteverdi's household.Strainchamps 161 While little is known about her life after she arrived in Mantua, it is presumable that she sang regularly at the court and that Monteverdi wrote many pieces of music for her.Strainchamps 163-164 Until her death, she was the Duke's preferred soprano in the court. Martinelli died of small pox on March 9, 1608. The Duke had a marble tomb built for her and ordered that Carmelite Priests should celebrate Mass and Offices in her memory every year on the anniversary of her death.Strainchamps 170 At the request of the Duke, Monteverdi composed a setting of a sestina written in her memory by Scipione Agnelli, a Mantuan bishop.Strainchamps 171 ==References== Category:Italian operatic sopranos Category:1608 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:17th-century Italian opera singers ",
