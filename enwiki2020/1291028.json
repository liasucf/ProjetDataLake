    "text": "Emma Anna Maria Zimmer (n\u00e9e Mezel; 14 August 1888 \u2013 20 September 1948) was a female overseer at the Lichtenburg concentration camp, the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp and the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination/concentration camp for several years during the war. Mezel was born in 1888 in Schl\u00fcchtern. In 1938, she became a guard at the Lichtenburg early concentration camp, where she became assistant camp leader under Johanna Langefeld. In 1939, she was assigned to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp, where she served as assistant chief leader, and in October 1942, she became assistant camp leader at Auschwitz II (Birkenau) as an SS-Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin. On 1 June 1943, one month before her 55th birthday, she was granted permission to stay on staff as a female overseer at Ravensbr\u00fcck, despite her age. She was one of the first chief woman officers at Ravensbr\u00fcck from 1939\u201341, and took an active part in the selection of internees to be gassed during 1941 at the Bernberg Euthanasia Center near Berlin. Zimmer served as a guard at Ravensbr\u00fcck, and was known in the camp for being brutal and sadistic in her guard duties. At Auschwitz, she was particularly feared: \"Our supervisor was an old and mean SS-woman called Emma Zimmer. She was vicious and dangerous and frightening us constantly with threats, proclaiming in a sadistic voice, \"I will report you and then you will go away, you know where? Just one way-up the chimney.\" We hated her and were scared of her.\"Lore Shelley, Auschwitz-The Nazi Civilization (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1992) p. 33 She was awarded the War Merit Cross Second Class without swords. Zimmer stood trial at the seventh Ravensbr\u00fcck Trial and was sentenced to death for her war crimes. She was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint on the gallows at Hamelin Prison on 20 September 1948; she was 60 years old. ==See also== * Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from Schl\u00fcchtern Category:People from Hesse-Nassau Category:Executed German women Category:Hamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials executions Category:Executed people from Hesse Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ",
