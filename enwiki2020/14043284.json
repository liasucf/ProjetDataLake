Along with the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS), the AOABOS is one of three leading entities that oversees physician board certification in the United States. The AOABOS assists its Member Boards in developing and implementing educational and professional standards to evaluate and certify physician specialists. AOABOS is recognized by the key healthcare accreditation organizations as a primary equivalent source of physician board certification data on medical specialists for credentialing purposes. ==History== The concept of a specialty board was first proposed in 1908 by Dr. Derrick T. Vail. In 1916, ophthalmology became the first officially incorporated board. The second specialty board, the American Board of Otolaryngology, was founded and incorporated in 1924. The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (1930) and the American Board of Dermatology and Syphilology (1932) followed. The AOABOS was organized in 1939 as the Advisory Board for Osteopathic Specialists for the certification of osteopathic physicians. The first medical specialty board part of the AOABOS was the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology. In 1993, the Board of Trustees of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), through its agency, the Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists, became the osteopathic certifying body. ==Member boards== The following are the specialty certifying boards of the American Osteopathic Association: * American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology * American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology * American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine * American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians * American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine * American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry * American Osteopathic Board of Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine * American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine * American Osteopathic Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology * American Osteopathic Board of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology * American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery * American Osteopathic Board of Pathology * American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics * American Osteopathic Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation * American Osteopathic Board of Preventive Medicine * American Osteopathic Board of Proctology * American Osteopathic Board of Radiology * American Osteopathic Board of Surgery ==See also== *American Board of Medical Specialties *Residency (medicine) *Fellowship (medicine) ==References== ==External links== * Page for the specialty boards at the Official AOA Site *List of Specialty boards Category:Osteopathic medical associations in the United States Category:Medical and health professional associations in Chicago ",
