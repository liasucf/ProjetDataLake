The authors trace the theoretical analysis of the nature and causes of unemployment over the last 150 years and argue that the shift from involuntary to so-called \"natural rate\" concepts of unemployment are behind an \"ideological backlash\" against state intervention as notably advocated, within the frame of the free economy, by Keynes in the 1930s. The authors further contend that unemployment is a reflection of systemic policy failures, rather than an \"individual problem\". They present a theoretical and empirical critique of the neo-liberal approach and suggest that the reinstatement of full employment, along with price stability, is a viable policy goal, achievable through an activist fiscal policy. ==Personal life== Muysken is married to Anne Marie du Saar. They have three children: Joan, Fransje, and Coen Muysken. ==See also== * Unemployment * Job Guarantee ==Notes== ==References== * Mitchell, William & Joan Muysken: Full Employment Abandoned: Shifting Sands and Policy Failures (2008), Edward Elgar Publishing 320 pp, Hardback, ==External links== * Faculty profile at Maastricht University * Category:Labor economists Category:Post-Keynesian economists Category:Dutch economists Category:Maastricht University faculty Category:University of Groningen alumni Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from Delft ",
