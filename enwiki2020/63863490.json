    "text": "Infinity is a studio album by jazz trumpeter Tom Harrell which was released by HighNote in 2019. ==Reception== At DownBeat magazine, Suzanne Lorge highlighted Harrell's sense of form as a composer and improvisation as a musician as two positive aspects. The playing of the sidemem \"flows flows holistically from his writing, with only the slightest of shifts between the composed and improvised sections. These natural transitions speak to a solid group rapport, where the soloists have a stake in the compositional act.\" At JazzTimes, David Whiteis wrote, \"Harrell sounds both delighted by his musical quest and enraptured by what he discovers. ... [Harrell's] muted trumpet skips with precision, dexterity, and brio, his solos so logically constructed that one could almost believe he's able to fully imagine each note, each run, each statement in its entirety before playing it.\" In Jazz Journal, Andy Hamilton gave the album five stars. == Track listing == All compositions by Tom Harrell # \"The Fast\" \u2013 6:38 # \"Dublin\" \u2013 9:40 # \"Hope\" \u2013 7:30 # \"Coronation\" \u2013 6:56 # \"Folk Song\" \u2013 6:03 # \"Blue\" \u2013 5:40 # \"Ground\" \u2013 7:18 # \"The Isle\" \u2013 8:25 # \"Duet\" \u2013 1:41 # \"Taurus\" \u2013 6:01 == Personnel == * Tom Harrell \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn * Mark Turner \u2013 tenor saxophone * Charles Altura \u2013 electric guitar, acoustic guitar * Ben Street \u2013 bass * Johnathan Blake \u2013 drums * Adam Cruz \u2013 percussion == References == Category:Tom Harrell albums Category:2019 albums Category:HighNote Records albums ",
