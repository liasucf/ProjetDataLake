The F2 2018 is the second car used by the FIA Formula 2 Championship and was introduced for the 2018 championship as a replacement for the aging Dallara GP2/11 chassis. As the Formula 2 Championship is a spec series, the F2 2018 is raced by every team and driver competing in the series. The F2 2018 was Dallara's first ever turbo-powered Formula 2 car and also the first turbo-powered Formula 1 junior feeder-series car since the Dallara GP3/10 in the GP3 Series. ==Design== ===History=== Dallara began the development, design, and construction of the F2/18 chassis in late 2015. The first F2/18 chassis was assembled in May 2017, with the first vehicle completed in early July 2017. The Dallara F2/18 was given a private shakedown in mid-July 2017 at Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. Codenamed F2/18 it was intended to see its first race in the 2018 season. During the teaser of unveiling on Formula 2's Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook account, Dallara decided to rename the F2/18 as F2 2018 in a reference for the new car naming year. Replacing the successful Dallara GP2/11 which had been raced since 2011, the F2 2018 had large shoes to fill. Built by Dallara at Dallara's main factory plant headquarters in Varano de' Melegari, Parma, Italy. On 27 August 2017 it was announced that the car would incorporate the Halo cockpit protection device for the 2018 season and beyond. The completed Dallara F2 2018 car was revealed during the race weekend at Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 31 August 2017. ===Chassis construction and aerodynamics=== The design of the car incorporates a lower nose, wider and lower rear wing, and a wider and curved front wing compared to the Dallara GP2/11 as the series adopts regulations more aesthetically in line with Formula One. The \"shark fin\" engine cover--a carbon fibre panel extending backwards from the engine cowling--was retained but its profile was lowered. While most of the car's mechanical parts were developed specifically for the F2 2018, the car continued to use the same tyres, fuel tank and brakes as the GP2/11. In , the car will use 18-inch wheels to allow Pirelli to gather data on how the larger tyres would work before they are introduced to Formula One in 2022. The design also features the \"halo\" cockpit protection device, a wishbone-shaped frame mounted to the monocoque designed to deflect debris away from a driver's head in the event of an accident. The car's rear wing still incorporates the drag reduction system (DRS) rear wing flap, for the purpose of improving overtaking maneuver assist. ===Cockpit=== The car's cockpit size also has been lengthened compared to the GP2/11. The steering wheel is completely different as it uses a single-seat Formula 2451 S3 steering wheel compared to the XAP single-seat carbon steering wheel used in the GP2/11. ===Engine package=== The F2 2018 features a brand-new engine package built specifically for the car. The aging Mecachrome V8 naturally-aspirated port electronic indirect-injected engine-- which had been used since the inaugural 2005 season of the GP2 Series--was replaced by a fuel-efficient V6 turbocharged direct-injected engine developed by Mecachrome Motorsport (V634 Turbo model). During the car's shakedown and preliminary testing phase at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, drivers noted that the change from natural aspiration to a turbocharger meant that the F2 2018 required a different driving style to its predecessor, the GP2/11, as the turbocharger produced more torque and thus required the driver to exercise greater control over the throttle. Van Der Lee Turbo Systems currently supplies turbocharger kits for all Mecachrome V634T engines. ===Fuel and lubricants=== Elf would remain as an official preferred fuel and lubricant supplier for all FIA Formula 2 Championship entrants due to in fact Mecachrome and Elf has a long-term technical partnership since 1969. ===Further development=== The F2 2018 went through a development programme after its d\u00e9but, with the car's launch control being the initial focus. The software of the electronic control unit was rewritten, introducing a new throttle map in a bid to prevent the car from stalling. The issue was attributed to difficulty in finding the bite point, or the point where the clutch engaged with the driveline to launch the car. Further updates were introduced to the car in June 2018 that were aimed at improving reliability and making the car easier to start. ===Retail cost=== The retail cost of the complete chassis package excluding the engine is currently up to EU\u20ac500,000 (GB\u00a3450,410; US$550,367.50) per car, while the Mecachrome V634T engine unit cost is up to \u20ac67,000 (GB\u00a360,355; US$73,741.88) per unit. ==Controversy== The car gained a reputation as being difficult to drive as the turbocharged engine required a more delicate touch on the throttle than the GP2/11. The opening five rounds of the 2018 championship saw several drivers stalling on the starting grid, prompting criticism of the design, led by drivers Artem Markelov, Lando Norris and George Russell. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile--the governing body of motorsport--also expressed concerns, with race director Charlie Whiting regularly examining the system. With no apparent solution to the problems, Norris expressed concerns that the stalling issue would ultimately settle the drivers' championship title, while Arjun Maini suggested that it was causing irreparable damage to their careers. Further criticism was also directed at reliability issues that prevented drivers from starting races. Series organiser Bruno Michel acknowledged that the car had too many problems at its launch, but argued that the introduction of the F2 2018 was necessary in light of the obsolete GP2/11 chassis, a view shared by team principals. The series introduced rolling starts as a temporary solution to the problem. The changes were introduced as the 2018 calendar featured three rounds over three consecutive weeks, making the introduction of a lasting solution difficult. Drivers expressed disappointment with the decision to use rolling starts, but also noted its necessity on safety grounds. A start-line accident in a Formula 3 race saw Ameya Vaidyanathan, starting from the eleventh row of the grid, crash into the stationary car of Dan Ticktum after Ticktum stalled, prompting concerns of a similar accident happening in Formula 2. A similar accident happened at the final round of the season in Abu Dhabi when Nicholas Latifi stalled on the grid and Arjun Maini was unable to avoid hitting him. Both drivers escaped unhurt. ==Fatal accidents== The F2 2018 was the first Dallara F2 chassis to suffer a fatality in FIA Formula 2 Championship to date, when Anthoine Hubert was killed in a crash during the feature race at the 2019 Belgian round. ==See also== * Dallara F3 2019 ==References== ==External links== * FIA Formula 2 Championship official website * FIA Formula 2 on dallara.it * Mecachrome Motorsport V634 Turbo Category:FIA Formula 2 Championship Category:Open wheel racing cars F2 2018 Category:Formula Two cars ",
