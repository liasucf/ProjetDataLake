The monument was erected in 1866 and constructed by builders Heard and Lindsley. In 1877 the original spire was increased from 12 feet in height to 19 feet in height. Other alterations have taken place on the Soldier's Monument throughout the years. In 1897 the two cannons were added as was a cement base, two years later a lightning strike caused damage that had to be repaired. In 1918 the eagle atop the original spire was broken off in a tornado and in 1965 a new cement base was added. The original spire featured an eagle atop the point. After damage to the original spire and the first replacement, the decision was made to exclude the eagle (which significantly increased the cost of the spire) in the most recent replacement made. ==Significance== The Soldier's Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 7, 1984 for its significant connection to social history. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ogle County, Illinois Category:Byron, Illinois Category:Monuments and memorials on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ",
