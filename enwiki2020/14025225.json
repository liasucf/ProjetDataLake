    "text": "In enzymology, a putrescine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + putrescine \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylputrescine Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and putrescine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylputrescine. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L- methionine:putrescine N-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called putrescine methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii. This enzyme is important in the synthesis of many plant alkaloids. It evolved from spermidine synthase. ==References== * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
