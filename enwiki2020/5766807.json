Seeking platinum by hydraulic mining in the early days of Happy Camp The town of Happy Camp \"The Heart of the Klamath\" is located on State Route 96, about west of Interstate 5 and northeast of Willow Creek. The town of O'Brien, Oregon is accessible from Happy Camp (which is nearly away). The shortest route to Oregon, over the Grey Back pass, is a seasonal summer road and is not cleared or maintained in snowy conditions. The Forest Service, located in Happy Camp on SR 96, provides road closure information. ==Name== Happy Camp was so named by miners in the early days of prosperity. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. H.C. Chester, who interviewed Jack Titus in 1882\u201383, states that Titus named the camp because his partner James Camp, upon arriving there, exclaimed, \"This is the happiest day in my life.\" Redick McKee mentions the camp on November 8, 1851, as \"Mr Roache's Happy Camp\" at the place known as Murderer's Bar. (Indian Report 1853:178) ==Geography== Happy Camp sits on the Klamath River and a nexus of creeks including Elk Creek, Little Grider Creek, Indian Creek, Doolittle Creek, Ikes Creek, Deer Lick Creek and Cade Creek.

It is marked by very hot summer days, being shielded in the valley behind the mountains from the cooling Pacific influence affecting nearby coastal locations. The winters are much cooler and snowier than in inland locations further south, albeit still very mild compared to areas to the east of the continent. The dry and hot summers make the surrounding forest prone to wildfires, as seen during the 2014 Happy Camp Complex Fire, which took months to extinguish and burned nearly to the Oregon border. The high winter rainfall, however, keeps the area greener than its summer climate would suggest. Average lows remain cool year- round, relieving the intense daytime heat and keeping the average July temperature at around , in sharp contrast to the average highs. ==Karuk Tribe== The Karuk Tribe is headquartered in Happy Camp. ==United States Forest Service== The U.S. Forest Service maintains an office in town.
