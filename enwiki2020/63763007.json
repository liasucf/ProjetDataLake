It took place in Uruguayan territory between March 5 and September 18, 1897. == History == The revolutionary movement was led by the Caudillo Aparicio Saravia, and the General Diego Lamas, who arrived at the Banda Oriental from Buenos Aires, together with the so-called \"22 de Lamas\", among which was Lieutenant Colonel Isabelino Canaveris. On March 17, 1897, took place the Battle of the Tres Arboles (department R\u00edo Negro), where the forces of General Diego Lamas defeated the army of Colonel Jos\u00e9 Villar. One of the causes of the conflict was electoral fraud denounced by leaders of the National Party, who demanded greater transparency in the elections. After several months of conflict, a peace agreement was signed on September 18, 1897. ==Gallery== File:Jefes blancos.jpg|Leaders of the Uruguayan National Party File:Pr\u00e1ctica de tiro de Guardias Nacionales en Canelones en la Revolucion de 1897.jpg|training of the National Party militias in Canelones File:Guerrillas de las Fuerzas Nacionalistas en la Revolucion de 1897 en Uruguay.jpg|Militiamen of the National Party File:Pr\u00e1ctica de tiro de fuerzas nacionalistas en la Revolucion de 1897 en Uruguay.jpg|Shooting practice of National Party forces File:Aparicio Saravia - Diego Lamas.jpg|Aparicio Saravia and Diego Lamas during the revolution File:Diego Lamas.jpg|Diego Lamas and Jos\u00e9 Pedro Ram\u00edrez, during the peace agreement == References == Category:Battles involving Uruguay Category:Conflicts in 1897 ",
