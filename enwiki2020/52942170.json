    "text": "Tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine is the organophosphorus compound with the formula P(SiMe3)3 (Me = methyl). It is a colorless liquid that ignites in air and hydrolyses readily. ==Synthesis== Tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine is prepared by treating trimethylsilyl chloride, white phosphorus, and sodium- potassium alloy: :1/4 P4 \\+ 3 Me3SiCl + 3 K \u2192 P(SiMe3)3 \\+ 3 KCl Several other methods exist. doi=10.1002/anie.199412901}} ==Reactions== The compound hydrolyzes to give phosphine: :P(SiMe3)3 \\+ 3 H2O \u2192 PH3 \\+ 3 HOSiMe3 Treatment of certain acyl chlorides with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine gives phosphaalkynes, one example being tert-butylphosphaacetylene.. :Synthesis of a phosphaalkyne using tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine. Reaction with potassium tert-butoxide cleaves one P-Si bond, giving the phosphide salt: :P(SiMe3)3 \\+ KO-t-Bu \u2192 KP(SiMe3)2 \\+ Me3SiO-t-Bu It is a reagent in the preparation of metal phosphido clusters by reaction with metal halides or carboxylates. In such reactions the silyl halide or silyl carboxylate is liberated as illustrated in this idealized reaction: :P(SiMe3)3 \\+ 3 CuCl \u2192 Cu3P + 3 ClSiMe3 ==Safety== Tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine spontaneously ignites in air, thus it is handled using air-free techniques. ==References== Category:Trimethylsilyl compounds Category:Phosphines ",
