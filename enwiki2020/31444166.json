    "text": "The episodes of the anime series The Twelve Kingdoms are based on the novel series written by Fuyumi Ono and illustrated by Akihiro Yamada. The series premiered on April 9, 2002 in Japan on NHK where it ran for forty-five episodes until its conclusion. The anime is licensed for English release on Region 1 DVD by AnimeWorks. The Twelve Kingdoms tells several stories from the world of the Twelve Kingdoms, located on several islands accessible through magic. On the islands, magic works and societies similar to classical China exist. While the inhabitants of the Twelve Kingdoms are aware of the existence of our world, the reverse is not true. The anime casts Yoko Nakajima, a Japanese girl who is suddenly transported to another world and eventually discovers that she is the empress of the kingdom of Kei, in the role of the main character and becomes the framing device for other stories in the novels that do not focus on her. The anime focuses on the Kingdom of Kei and the events surrounding it. Several of the other countries are introduced, the most prominent being Kou, En and Tai, while Kyou, Hou, Sai and Ryuu play a minor role compared to the other three. The rest of the kingdoms are only introduced by name and a brief description of the current ruler and taiho. The anime also introduced the characters Asano and Sugimoto to accompany Yoko to the Twelve Kingdoms. Their role is to externalize some of Yoko's problems that were internal in the novels. __TOC__ ==Episode list== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\" |- ! style=\"background: #CCF\" width=\"3%\" | Ep# ! style=\"background: #CCF\" | Title ! style=\"background: #CCF\" | Original air date |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==External links== ;Official sites * Official NHK site ;Unofficial sites * * List of Twelve Kingdoms episodes (anime) at Type40 Entertainment Category:The Twelve Kingdoms Category:Chinese mythology in anime and manga Category:Fantasy anime and manga Twelve Kingdoms episodes ",
