    "text": "Gary Mason (15 December 1962 \u2013 6 January 2011) was a British boxer who was based in Chatham, Kent, England. He was born in Jamaica. Mason fought at the heavyweight level and became the British heavyweight champion in 1989. Mason was a top ten contender, his main strengths being his punching power, heart and physical strength. Mason died on 6 January 2011 in a cycling accident in South London. ==Pro boxing career== Mason fought 38 times as a professional in a career that spanned 10 years from 1984 to 1994, with 37 wins (34 by knockout) and only one loss, that being to Lennox Lewis when he challenged for the European title in 1991. Mason gave Lewis his hardest fight up to that point in his career. Mason defeated a number of well known heavyweights, including Tyrell Biggs, James Tillis, Alfonzo Ratliff, Ricky Parkey, James Pritchard, Louis Pergaud, Hughroy Currie and David Jaco. Mason sparred with the former WBA World cruiserweight number one and avoided British heavyweight champion David Pearce. Pearce helped him with sparring in preparation for Mason's title fights. Mason praised Pearce and said he was instrumental in his helping his career. He suffered a detached retina in a bout with Everett Martin in 1990. After a short retirement he staged a comeback, which ended with a TKO defeat by Lennox Lewis, which aggravated Mason's eye injury. He came back once again, but after winning two fights in the US he retired for good. ==Professional boxing record== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ 37 Wins (34 knockouts, 3 decisions), 1 Loss (1 knockout, 0 decisions) |- !
