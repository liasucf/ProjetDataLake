Bernhard F\u00f6rster (2nd left) among other German antisemitic writers, ca. 1880 ==Biography== F\u00f6rster became a leading figure in the anti-Semitic faction on the far right of German politics and wrote on the Jewish question, characterizing Jews as constituting a \"parasite on the German body\". Also published in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichtswissenschaft 6/1994, pp. 485-496 In order to support his beliefs he set up the Deutscher Volksverein (German People's League) in 1881 with Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg.Karl Dietrich Bracher, The German Dictatorship, 1970, pp. 59-60 He left Germany in 1883 to emigrate to Paraguay and, after searching the country for many months, found a suitable site to establish a colony. It was 600 square kilometres and almost 300 kilometres north of Asuncion. The colony was to become known as \"Nueva Germania\". Forster returned to Germany in March 1885 and married Elisabeth Nietzsche on 22 May. The couple assembled a group of 'pioneers' who shared their anti-Semitic views and wished to live in a new 'Fatherland' where an Aryan could prosper. They travelled to Paraguay from Hamburg in February 1886. The initiative was a failure for many reasons, not least the harsh environment. Forster, with unserviceable debts, drank heavily and became depressed.

Bernhard F\u00f6rster was buried in San Bernardino.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011). After his death, his widow Elisabeth wrote a book entitled Bernhard F\u00f6rster's Colony New Germany in Paraguay. Intended to salvage F\u00f6rster's reputation by portraying him as a hero, the book first appeared in print in 1891. ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1889 deaths Category:German emigrants to Paraguay Category:German nationalists Category:German schoolteachers Category:People from Delitzsch Category:People from the Province of Saxony Category:Suicides by poison Category:Far-right politics in Germany Category:Antisemitism in Germany ",
