    "text": "Texas Woman's University (TWU) is a public co-educational university in Denton, Texas, with two health science center branches in Dallas and Houston. While TWU has been fully co-educational since 1994, it is the largest state- supported university primarily for women in the United States. TWU is one of four independent public universities in Texas not affiliated with one of the public university systems in the state. It currently offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in 60 areas of study across six colleges. ==History== Early class of students in a physical education program In the late nineteenth century, several Texas-based groups (including the Texas Press Women's Association, the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs, the Grange, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union) began advocating for the creation of a state-supported women's college focused on a practical education, including domestic skills young women would need to prepare as wives and mothers. In 1901, after the state Democratic Party adopted the idea as a platform in the upcoming election, the college's establishment was authorized by the Texas Legislature. Originally named the Texas Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Texas in the Arts and Sciences, it opened in Denton in 1902 with a class of 186 students and 14 faculty. With three women on its inaugural board of regents, they became the first women to sit on the governing board of a Texas university. The school was soon renamed the Girls Industrial College in 1903 and conferred its first degrees the following year.Sayles' Annotated Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, Title 86, Chapter 5a, 1908 In 1905, the name changed again to the College of Industrial Arts and expanded its programs to include liberal arts, fine arts, and sciences. Upon its founding, the school was primarily focused on rural and small town women seeking vocational training. Since many areas of the state lacked comprehensive high schools, the first two years of CIA's curriculum were preparatory; students enrolling with a high school degree were automatically admitted to the college as juniors. With its home extension program and summer school, the school was the first in Texas to offer instruction in home economics, supplying an overwhelming majority of the state's high school teachers in home economics in the early twentieth century. In 1914, CIA implemented its first four-year college curriculum, and the first bachelor's degrees were conferred in 1915. By 1929, the college had expanded its programs sufficiently to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the American Association of University Women, and the Association of American Universities, and it began offering its first master's degrees in 1930. In 1934, the school underwent another name change to the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) to reflect its growing reputation as a premiere institution of higher education for women in the state. Ann Stuart Science Complex Despite the social and cultural limitations for professional women at the time, the college pioneered several academic programs to meet the needs of a growing postwar economy in Texas and built a national reputation for its programs and research in textiles, food, and nutrition, awarding the college's first doctoral degrees in 1953. In 1950, it also developed the first nationally accredited nursing program in the state, opening at the original Parkland Hospital in downtown Dallas in 1954, and joining the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies in the 1960s, receiving a series of research grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to study the health effects on humans in space flights. In 1956, it established the first building in Texas dedicated solely to the instruction of library sciences. Finally, in 1957, the school changed its name for the fourth time to Texas Woman's University, and expanded its health sciences programs to a campus in Houston in 1960. The college also enjoyed a close relationship with Texas A&M; University in College Station in the early and mid-twentieth century. As the only gender segregated public colleges in Texas at the time, the schools generated considerable media attention for their institutional-supported fraternizing at major sporting and social events; for several decades, a \"Tessie\" was named the \"Aggie Sweetheart\" at A&M;'s football rivalry matchup. The practice fizzled in the 1970s when each school began admitting both male and female students, although the schools do still collaborate in several academic and service programs. Like most non-HBCU institutions in Texas, the school originally admitted only white students. The university integrated in 1961, admitting its first African-American student, Alsenia Dowells, to study nursing; while Dowells only attended for one year, six more black women enrolled the following year. The university currently boasts a 20% black student population and is also designated as a Hispanic-serving institution, and a member of Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, with more than 25% of its full-time student population identifying as Hispanic or Latino. After nearly six decades as a school for women, TWU began admitting men into its health sciences graduate school in 1972 in response to pending litigation at other universities regarding the Equal Protection Clause. In 1994, in anticipation of changing protocols of single-gender institutions across the United States such as the Citadel and Mississippi College for Women, the school opened all of its programs to qualified men. Despite being a co-educational university since 1972, TWU remains overwhelmingly women, with approximately 90% of the student body identifying as such, and it continues to place a heavy emphasis on meeting the educational needs of women. It remains unique among Texas higher education institutions by requiring all undergraduates, regardless of their proposed major or degree, to take three credit hours of multicultural women's studies in order to graduate. ==Campus== Old Main Building The university's main campus consists of 270 acres in Denton, Texas, approximately forty miles northwest of Dallas. Upon the university's founding, the Old Main Building was constructed in 1902 and housed all of the school's academic programs and students. The first dormitory opened in 1907 and a second classroom building was constructed in 1911. During the Great Depression, college president L.H. Hubbard used the federal government's growing funds available through the Works Projects Administration and Public Works Administration to expand the campus infrastructure, doubling instructional space, improving local roads and sidewalks, and establishing regional landmarks such as the Little Chapel in the Woods. In 1938, the campus was gifted the Pioneer Woman statue by the state legislature, commissioned to Leo Friedlander to commemorate the Texas Centennial. A second period of expansion in the 1960s and 1970s established most of the university's current campus footprint with more than twenty instructional and administrative buildings. The Denton campus also currently five residence halls, all of which are currently co-educational, including Guinn Hall, the tallest building in Denton.http://www.twu.edu/housing/residence-halls.asp > Students classified as freshmen or sophomores, or who are under the age of 21, are required to live in campus housing. TWU\u2019s Dallas campus at the Southwestern Medical District The nursing and health science programs are supported by satellite campuses in Dallas, Texas and Houston, Texas. The T. Boone Pickens Institute of Health Sciences in Dallas is based in the Southwestern Medical District, which also houses Parkland Hospital, Children's Medical Center Dallas, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The Institute of Health Sciences in Houston is located in the heart of the Texas Medical Center district, near the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Texas Children's Hospital. === Gallery === File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 01 (sign).jpg|South Entrance File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 18 (Arts and Sciences Building).jpg|Arts and Sciences Building File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 50 (The Green House).jpg|Greenhouse File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 03 (Human Development Building).jpg|Woodcock Hall File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 67 (Pioneer Hall).jpg|Pioneer Hall File:Texas Woman's University September 2015 58 (Fitness and Recreation Center).jpg|Fitness and Recreation Center, with Stark Hall and Guinn Hall in background ==Academics== With more than 500 full-time faculty, approximately 75% of classes have 30 students or fewer. Nationally recognized programs include those in nursing, multicultural and gender studies, library science and information studies, and occupational therapy. The university is divided into six colleges: #College of Arts and Sciences provides the bulk of undergraduate instruction and includes English, speech, and foreign languages; psychology and philosophy; history and government; biology, chemistry, and physics; fashion and textiles; mathematics and computer sciences; sociology; social work; and multicultural and gender studies. The college also encompasses the School of the Arts, which supports programs in music, visual art, theater, and dance. #College of Business offers undergraduate programs in accounting, business, business administration, finance, human resource management, management, and marketing, and graduate programs in business administration, healthcare administration, and health systems management. #College of Health Sciences is supported at the Denton, Houston, and Dallas campuses and includes the Schools of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, the School of Health Promotion and Kinesiology, the Department of Communication Sciences and Oral Health, and the Department of Nutrition & Food Sciences. #College of Nursing was established in 1954, growing to become the second-largest in Texas and one of the largest in the country, offering programs at the baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral level. Its doctoral program is the fifth oldest in the United States and remains the largest in the world. In addition to the Bachelor of Science program for students with no prior degree, the college offers a weekend program for students who already have a bachelor's degree; the College also has a Registered Nurse to Baccalaureate program (RN to BSN) and a Registered Nurse to Master's Program (RN to MS). With campuses in Houston and Dallas, admission is very competitive with the cut-off GPA frequently at 4.0. #College of Professional Education encompasses Departments of Family Sciences, Reading and Teacher Education, and the School of Library and Information Studies. #Graduate School functions as a distinct university component. The Graduate School processes graduate admissions to the university and subsequent academic affairs, including degrees in a variety of programs. ==The Woman's Collection== The second floor of Blagg-Huey Library houses The Woman's Collection. Established in 1932 by the library at the suggestion of then- president L.H.

Designed by leading American architect and Denton resident O'Neill Ford, recruits from the National Youth Administration constructed the building, while more than 300 students in the college's fine arts programs designed and created the building\u2019s artwork, including the stained glass windows, lighting, woodwork, doors, ceiling beams, and flooring. The stained glass windows depict scenes of \"Women Ministering to Human Needs\" including nursing, teaching, speech, literature, service, dance, and music. The Chapel is open to the public daily and remains a popular destination for recitals, baptisms, and weddings; the original bridal book contains thousands of names of couples who were married between the years 1939 and 1979. The original bridal book is currently on display at the Blagg-Huey Library. === Texas Women's Hall of Fame === Hubbard Hall Hubbard Hall, the former central dining facility, housed the Texas Women's Hall of Fame from 1984 until 2018.

Notable past editors include Pulitzer Prize-winner Caro Crawford Brown; Grace Robinson New, the first female television news reporter in Dallas; Kathy Williams, assistant news director Houston's NBC affiliate; and Stacie Walker, an award-winning former national news editor for Newsday. A magazine, The Dadaelian, was published monthly by students in the Elocution, Physical Culture and Vocal Music department in 1906 to highlight student-created prose, poetry, and visual art; it switched to a quarterly format in 1914. It is currently published online as a literary journal featuring short stories, artwork, photography, and poetry. ===Sororities=== Approximately three percent of undergraduate women are active in a sorority on campus.https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/texas-womans- university-3646/student-life *Alpha Omicron Pi *Alpha Gamma Delta *Sigma Sigma Sigma *Alpha Kappa Alpha *Delta Sigma Theta *Zeta Phi Beta *Sigma Gamma Rho *Sigma Lambda Gamma *Sigma Lambda Alpha *Sigma Alpha Iota ===Fraternities=== Approximately two percent of undergraduate men are active in a fraternity on campus.https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/texas-womans- university-3646/student-life *Kappa Sigma *Phi Beta Sigma *Phi Iota Alpha *Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia ==Notable alumni and faculty== === Alumni === *Claire Myers Owens (B.S. 1916), social worker, novelist, and Zen Buddhist theologian *Caro Crawford Brown (B.A. 1925), winner of Pulitzer Prize for local reporting in 1955 for the Alice (Texas) Daily Echo *Laura Lee Bird (B.S. 1929, M.A. 1931), New York stage costume designer and poet *Margaret Virginia (Margo) Jones (B.A. 1932) and (M.A. 1933), pioneer in the American Resident Theater Movement and author of Theater In The Round; directed the world premiere of Inherit the Wind by Lawrence and Lee in Dallas in 1955 *Nelle C.
