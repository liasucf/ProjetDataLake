Born in a Hungarian village called H\u0151gy\u00e9sz to a family of a French origin, he moved to Michalovce, Slovakia in 1911, where he stayed for another 33 years. As a result, he is often referred to as \"the painter of the Zempl\u00edn sun and people\". ==Biography== Jozef Teodor Mousson was born on 15 December 1887 in a village called H\u0151gy\u00e9sz which lies in today Hungary's Tolna County. In his vital records his family name is spelt as Moussong, i.e. with a letter g at the end. His father worked as a teacher and his mother was a housewife. It is said that their ancestors came to Hungary from the Alsace region. Between 1905 and 1909 Mousson studied at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts in Budapest. He married Irena Grundov\u00e1 in 1910 whom he met during a study trip at the Lake Balaton. Shortly after the marriage he got an offer to teach in Michalovce, Slovakia. In 1911 he moved to Michalovce, where he served as a teacher until 1919. That's when he started his career as a professional painter. In 1942 he suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage and the whole left part of his body became paralysed. In 1946 he moved to Bratislava due to his bad physical and psychic state and later to his son in Tren\u010d\u00edn, where he died. ==References== Citations * Jozef Teodor Mousson (in Slovak) \u2013 Original source of this article * ALL ABOUT SHIPPING.co.uk * SOGA, auk\u010dn\u00e1 spolo\u010dnos\u0165 (in Slovak) * Mesto Michalovce \u2013 Jozef Teodor Mousson (in Slovak) * Magistra hist\u00f3ria (in Slovak) * Zempl\u00ednske m\u00fazeum (in Slovak) * Gal\u00e9ria Nedbalka (in Slovak) * SME.sk \u2013 Maliar Michaloviec \u2013 J.
