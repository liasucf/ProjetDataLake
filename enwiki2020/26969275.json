    "text": "The Holmfast inscriptions carved into a rock face by a road in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, S\u00f6dermanland, Sweden The Holmfast Inscriptions are two Viking Age memorial runic inscriptions and one image that are designated as S\u00f6 311, S\u00f6 312, and S\u00f6 313 in the Rundata catalog. They are located in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Stockholm County and the province of S\u00f6dermanland, Sweden by the eponymous road Holmfastv\u00e4gen. ==Description== Detail showing the beast on the S\u00f6 313 image. The right carving S\u00f6 313 is purely ornamental and probably represents a wolf. The lean wolf with hanging tongue seems to quickly rush out of the picture. The carving also includes a couple of ordinary rune snakes and a braided ring cross. The depicted cross means that Holmfast's family were Christian, which is further supported by the content of the text. The style of the carvings indicate that they were made around 1050\u20131080 AD. They were signed by rune master \u00d6sten (Eysteinn in the runic text), who also signed Su 344 at Kiholm and S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Canal in V\u00e4stert\u00e4lje parish, and the recently discovered Bornhuvud carving on Bornhuvud at Vitsand in Salem parish. Road and bridge-building as described in the runic text is fairly common in runestones during this time period. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges in a practice similar to the use of indulgences in return for the church's intercession for the soul of the departed. pp. 490-492. Holmfast's road led from T\u00e4lje to N\u00e4sby, which was located on Lake M\u00e5snaren, about three kilometres west of the carving. Where the ground was sunken, the road had to be reinforced with a bridge system in the form of stone fillings or wooden structures. Today's stretch of road still follows the original route. The Holmfast carving is created on a rock that cannot be moved, and the carving is very elaborate as it consists of two messages. Rune carvings were status symbols that would be seen by many bypasses, so it is likely that Holmfast's road was part of a larger road system. There are many indications that it was a precursor to G\u00f6ta landsv\u00e4g, the oldest and most well-known road connection that went from Stockholm via S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje further south towards G\u00f6taland. The three carvings are considered to have been made contemporaneously and all made by a runemaster with the normalized name of \u00d6sten (Eysteinn in the runic text), with his signature appearing on S\u00f6 312. The inscriptions are known as Holmfastristningen or \"Holmfast carvings\" after the name of the road that passes near them. ==S\u00f6 311== Detail showing serpent head on S\u00f6 311. S\u00f6 311 consists of runic text carved onto a serpent band. The inscription, which is rather damaged, is 1.2 meters in height and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also called Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond- shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. ===Inscription=== ====Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters==== :hulfastr + lit + braut + ru\u00feia + aft\u0280 + ik----(\u00fe)i + mu(\u00fe)-r + sina + ku-- + -r-a... + sina +Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for S\u00f6 311. ====Transcription into Old Norse==== :Holmfastr let braut ry\u00f0ia \u00e6fti\u0280 Ing[i]..., mo\u00f0[u]r sina go[\u00f0a] ... sina. ====Translation in english==== :Holmfastr had the path cleared in memory of Ingi-... his good mother ... his. ==S\u00f6 312== Detail showing cross and serpent head on S\u00f6 312. S\u00f6 312 consists of runic text carved onto a serpent band that circles a Christian cross. The inscription is 1.5 meters in height and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also classified as being an Urnes style. The text in two locations follows the rule that two consecutive identical letters are represented by a single rune, even when the two identical letters are at the end of one word and the start of a second word. This inscription uses one i-rune for the words byki| |i. The inscription is signed by the runemaster Eysteinn, which is normalized as \u00d6sten, by simply adding his name at the end of the text without using any verb such as \"carved\" or \"painted.\" Although such signatures are unusual on runestones, there is another example of an inscription being signed in this manner on S\u00f6 266 in Sanda. This is the only surviving inscription known to have been signed by this runemaster, although two other Urnes style inscriptions, S\u00f6 338 at Turinge and S\u00f6 344 at Kiholm, have been attributed to \u00d6sten based upon stylistic grounds. ===Inscription=== ====Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters==== :hulfastr lit \u00d7 braut \u00d7 ry\u00feia \u00d7 auk \u00d7 bro kiara ifti\u0280 gam-- \u00d7 fa\u00feur \u00d7 sin \u00d7 sum \u00d7 byki| |i : nesby \u00d7 ku\u00fe \u00d7 hialbi ant hans aystainProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for S\u00f6 312. ====Transcription into Old Norse==== :Holmfastr let braut ry\u00f0ia ok bro g\u00e6rva \u00e6fti\u0280 Gam[al], fa\u00f0ur sinn, sum byggi i N\u00e6sby.
