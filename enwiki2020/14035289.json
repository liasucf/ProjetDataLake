    "text": "R\u0131fat Ilgaz (7 May 1911 \u2013 7 July 1993) was a Turkish teacher, writer and poet. ==Biography== He was born in Cide, in the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey). Ilgaz was one of Turkey\u2019s best-known and most prolific poets and writers, having authored over sixty works. Ilgaz started writing poetry during his junior school years and evolved into one of the prolific social-realist writers of the 20th-century Turkish literature. His poems are considered prime examples of socialist-realistic writing. While he has never really been a partisan of political ideologies, the fact that he has written about the sufferings of the people placed him at a left wing perspective. Like other writers of his time, Ilgaz was imprisoned as a result of one of his publications. In addition to his writing, he led an accomplished career as a lecturer in Turkish literature. R\u0131fat Ilgaz died in Istanbul on 7 July 1993 due to lung failure. He was buried at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. == English language bibliography == One collection of Ilgaz's short stories has been published in English translation. === Fourth Company === A 2001 short story collection by Turkish writer Rifat Ilgaz published by Milet Books, in dual Turkish and English translation by Damian Croft, as part of its series of Turkish-English Short Story Collections. The publisher states that, \u201cIn the deftly comic six-part story, Fourth Company and two further stories, Rifat Ilgaz turns his sharp but affectionate wit on compulsory military service, holidays at home and the pathological fear of doctors.\u201d The volume consists of the stories; *Fourth Company (Parts 1\u20136) *Off to Exchange Bayram Greetings *A Fear of Doctors ==== Editions ==== * ==Selected works== * Apart\u0131man \u00c7ocuklar\u0131 * Bacaks\u0131z Okulda * Bacaks\u0131z Plajda * Cart Curt * \u00c7al\u0131\u015f Osman \u00c7iftlik Senin * Devam * Don Ki\u015fot Istanbul'da * Garibin Horozu * Ge\u00e7mi\u015fe Mazi * G\u00fcvercinim Uyur mu? * Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 (1975) (made into a movie) * Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 S\u0131n\u0131fta Kald\u0131 (1975) (made into a movie) * Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 Bask\u0131nda (made into a movie) * Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 \u0130craat\u0131n \u0130\u00e7inde * Hababam S\u0131n\u0131f\u0131 Uyan\u0131yor * Hoca Nasrettin Ve \u00c7\u00f6mezleri * Karadeniz'in K\u0131y\u0131c\u0131\u011f\u0131nda * Karartma Geceleri (1990) (made into a movie) * K\u0131rk Y\u0131l Once K\u0131rk Y\u0131l Sonra * Kula\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Kiri\u015fte * Nerde Kalm\u0131\u015ft\u0131k * Nerde O Eski Usturalar * Ocak Kat\u0131r\u0131 Alag\u00f6z * \u00d6ks\u00fcz Civciv * Pijamal\u0131lar * Radar\u0131n Anahtar\u0131 * R\u00fc\u015fvetin Alamancas\u0131 * Sar\u0131 Yazma * S\u0131n\u0131f * Soluk Solu\u011fa/Karak\u0131l\u00e7\u0131k/Uzak De\u011fil * Sosyal Kad\u0131nlar Partisi * \u015eeker Kutusu * \u00dcsk\u00fcdar'da Sabah Oldu * Yarenlik * Ya\u015fad\u0131k\u00e7a * Y\u0131ld\u0131z Karayel * Yoku\u015f Yukar\u0131 ==See also== * List of contemporary Turkish poets ==References== Category:1911 births Category:People from Cide Category:People from Kastamonu Vilayet Category:Gazi E\u011fitim Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc alumni Category:Turkish schoolteachers Category:Turkish male writers Category:Turkish novelists Category:Turkish male poets Category:Turkish prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Turkey Category:20th-century novelists Category:20th-century poets Category:Turkish Marxists Category:1993 deaths Category:Burials at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery ",
