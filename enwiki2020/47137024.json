The play is a sequel to Osborne's first successful play, Look Back in Anger (1956); it portrays the life and thoughts of the central character from the earlier play, Jimmy Porter (referred to as J.P.), in middle age. ==Creation== Osborne had been thinking about a sequel to Look Back in Anger for some years, and had been working on a draft of the play since 1987 when he started jotting down ideas and plotting it out. The play itself was written over several months in from December 1988 to April 1989. He tried out several titles, but decided on D\u00e9j\u00e0vu, \"deliberately misspelt\", according to John Heilpern, as a single word (rather than the correct \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\").Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.446ff. ==Production difficulties== The play was sent to Richard Eyre at the Royal National Theatre who rejected it, suggesting that it would work best as a \"monologue performed prior to a performance of LOOK BACK IN ANGER\". Tony Richardson, the original director of Look Back in Anger, was enthusiastic, but it was again turned down by Max Stafford-Clark at the Royal Court Theatre. Several readers took the view that it was much too long, and so should be cut. Stephen Daldry thought that Osborne would have been better advised to do a one-man show, performing Porter's rants in the play himself. Osborne approached various actors and directors but was unable to develop the production, at one point writing a bitter letter to The Times about his problems. Peter O'Toole agreed to play the main role, but dropped out after conflicts with Osborne over proposed cuts to the script. John Standing also dropped out after an argument with Osborne. Eventually Peter Egan took the role of Porter, and the play was produced in May 1992 at the Thorndike Theatre directed by Tony Palmer. The play was not a commercial success, closing after a run of seven weeks. Egan later wrote, \"I knew the play wouldn't work but I couldn't turn it down. I knew John deserved to be presented again \u2013 and that it would be his last work...The play was a commercial failure but it reawakened people to the great energy and power of Osborne.\" Peter Egan, \"John Osborne: Monologue, actors on acting\", The Guardian, 25 March 2014 The failure of the play distressed Osborne who thereafter signed himself \"John Osborne, ex-playwright\". The play was revived at the Comedy Theatre, Panton Street, around 1993 but closed after some weeks. Peter O'Toole and Hayley Mills were there, among many others. O'Toole walked out shouting, \"Oi've never heard such f...\u2026. rubbish!\" ==Original cast== *Peter Egan as J.P. *Gareth Thomas as Cliff *Alison Johnston as Alison Porter, J.P.'s daughter *Eve Matheson as Helena ==Plot== Jimmy Porter (J.P.) is living with his daughter Alison, who begins the play ironing, just as her mother, also Alison, did in Look Back in Anger. J.P. and Alison argue relentlessly, as she expresses her contempt for her own misanthropic father. Jimmy's old friend Cliff tries to smooth things over, while Alison's friend Helena attempts to support her. J.P. takes consolation in his teddy bear as he objects to the vulgarisation of the English language and the corrupting influences of various social agencies. In the end, Alison walks out on her father. ==Critical reception== Osborne and Palmer both argued that Jimmy Porter (J.P.) is essentially a \"comedy character\" comparable to Falstaff, whose self-aggrandising rants are not to be taken too seriously. Osborne wrote that J.P. \"generates energy, but, also, like, say, Malvolio or Falstaff, an inescapable melancholy\". Palmer also argued that \"J.P. has a life-enhancing Falstaffian quality; he [Falstaff] was a coward, a braggart, a liar, totally unscrupulous, a drunk, with an inheritance, like J.P. And just like Falstaff, J.P. can stop the play dead in its tracks and say 'what is honour'\".\"D\u00e9j\u00e0vu\", The Independent, 10 June 1992. The play's original reviews were mixed. The Independent noted that Jimmy's rants in the original play were exhilarating because they were transgressive, but the \"ageing J.P. merely proves that, in less shockable times, the unspeakable is all too easily spoken\".\"D\u00e9j\u00e0vu\", The Independent, 12 June 1992. Several critics complained that the play was essentially a vehicle for J.P.'s pontifications, being as, as The Sunday Times put it, \"essentially one long speech\".The Sunday Time, 14 June 1992. Sheridan Morley called it \"a monologue without a play\".Morley, Sheridan, \"D\u00e9j\u00e0vu\", International Herald Tribune, 17 May 1992. Sheila Stowell, in an essay on D\u00e9j\u00e0vu, comments that the play is not a \"sequel\" in the traditional Hollywood sense of an attempt to cash-in on an earlier success; rather it is an attempt to \"blow up\" the rebellious image of Look Back\u2019s Jimmy Porter. She disputes the comparison to Falstaff because J.P.'s antagonists are all \"sham characters\", easily outwitted by the hero, unlike Shakespeare's play in which Falstaff's bluster is exposed for what it is.Sheila Stowell \"Honey, I Blew up the Ego\", Patricia D. Denison, John Osborne: A Casebook, pp.167ff. However, she argues that J.P.'s social criticisms are largely consistent with the anarchic attitudes of the 1956 Jimmy. ==References== Category:1992 plays Category:Plays by John Osborne Category:Sequel plays ",
