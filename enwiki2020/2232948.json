    "text": "Slavonian Military Frontier in 1849 The Slavonian Military Frontier ( or ; ; ; ) was a district of the Military Frontier, a territory in the Habsburg Monarchy, first during the period of the Austrian Empire and then during the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. It was formed out of territories the Habsburgs conquered from the Ottoman Empire and included southern parts of Slavonia and Syrmia; today the area it covered is mostly in eastern Croatia, with its easternmost parts in northern Serbia (mostly in Vojvodina region). ==Divisions== The Slavonian Military Frontier was divided between three regiments: Regiment N\u00b0VII, based at Vinkovci; Regiment N\u00b0VIII, based at Nova Gradi\u0161ka and Regiment N\u00b0IX, based at Petrovaradin. Other important towns in the area included Sremski Karlovci, Stara Pazova, Zemun, and Sremska Mitrovica. ==History== During the history, name Slavonian Military Frontier referred to different territories. It was first located in what is now Central Croatia and was known as the Vara\u017edin generalat. It was created from territories that had been part of medieval Banovina of Slavonia. Shortly after its creation in the 16th century, original Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Ottoman Empire to the east, the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia (part of the Habsburg Monarchy) to the west, the Croatian Military Frontier to the south-west, and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, also part of the Habsburg Empire, to the north. After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), Habsburg Monarchy expanded its territory towards east and new sections of the Military Frontier were founded along the Sava, Danube, Tisa and Mure\u015f rivers. New parts of the frontier were divided into two generalats: the first one included territory from Gradi\u0161ka to river Tisa and the second one included territories along the Tisa and Mure\u015f rivers. Until the middle of the 18th century, the entire Slavonia region was under military administration. In 1745, northern parts of Slavonia were placed under civil administration and were organized into the newly formed Habsburg crownland known as the Kingdom of Slavonia. The southern parts of Slavonia that remained under military administration were organized into Slavonian Military Frontier, while former original Slavonian Military Frontier was organized as Vara\u017edin section of the Croatian Military Frontier. In the second half of the 18th century, the Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Croatian Military Frontier to the west, the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to the north, the Banat Military Frontier to the east and the Ottoman province of Bosnia and Sanjak of Smederevo to the south. In 1783 it was placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command () headquartered in Zagreb.Gunther Erich Rothenberg: The Military Border in Croatia, 1740\u20131881: a study of an imperial institution, University of Chicago Press, 1966, p. 63 The only changes of this province's borders and neighborhood before its integration into Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1881 were in 1848\u20131849 when autonomous Serbian Vojvodina included eastern parts of Slavonian Military Frontier and between 1849 and 1860, during the existence of Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crownland which became a north-eastern neighbor of Slavonian Military Frontier. After the creation of the Principality of Serbia in 1815, this was their southeastern neighbor. ==Population and demographics== ===1776=== In 1776, the rural population of the Slavonian military frontier was 177,212.
