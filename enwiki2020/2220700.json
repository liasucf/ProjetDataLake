    "text": "Pseudophysics is a pseudoscientific practice using the language of physics or discussing issues related to or pertinent to physics to promote ideas which are either incoherent or contradictory to known physics (experimental phenomenology). According to physicists, skeptics, and science writers, pseudophysics tends to be promoted by so-called \"cranks\",http://physics.about.com/b/2012/02/17/physicscranks.htm whose ideas lack peer review, lack falsifiable predictions, and/or blatantly contradict scientific facts and experimental results. Mathematical physicist John C. Baez famously invented a crackpot index to give an idea of what sort of claims and rhetoric were commonplace among pseudophysics proposals he had come across.http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html == See also == * Hypothetico-deductive method * Statistical hypothesis testing * Theoretical physics * Mathematical physics * Experimental physics * List of pseudoscientific theories ==References== * Paine, Michael, \"Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit\".
