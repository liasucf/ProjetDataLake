    "text": "Frenet\u2013Serret frame, and the osculating plane (spanned by T and N). In mathematics, particularly in differential geometry, an osculating plane is a plane in a Euclidean space or affine space which meets a submanifold at a point in such a way as to have a second order of contact at the point. The word osculate is from the Latin osculatus which is a past participle of osculari, meaning to kiss. An osculating plane is thus a plane which \"kisses\" a submanifold. The osculating plane in the geometry of Euclidean space curves can be described in terms of the Frenet-Serret formulas as the linear span of the tangent and normal vectors. == See also == * Osculating circle * Differential geometry of curves#Special Frenet vectors and generalized curvatures Category:Differential geometry ",
