    "text": "Opijnen is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is a part of the municipality of Neerijnen, and lies about 10 km southwest of Tiel. Opijnen was a separate municipality until 1818, when it changed its name to Est en Opijnen. Opijnen is home to the graves of eight American airmen who were shot down on July 30, 1943, and killed while returning to England from a bombing raid over Kassel, Germany. The village honored the airmen - George Richard Krueger, Mike Anthony Perrotta, Daniel Victor Ohman, Hermon Daines Poling, Harold Royce Sparks, Robert Urquhart Duggan, Douglas Victor Blackwood, and Americo Chiafichi - by burying them in their cemetery. From that time and for seventy-five years afterwards, the village honored these men annually with a formal church service and then a laying of flowers on the graves. In 2006, the village opened a housing complex with eighty-six units. The airmen were further honored by having the streets in that housing complex named after them.Washington Post Magazine November 11, 2018 In 2001, the village of Opijnen had 641 inhabitants.
