    "text": "The Little Cypress Creek Brook is a historic bridge in rural western Phillips County, Arkansas. Located south of the hamlet of Postelle, it carries County Road 600 over Little Cypress Creek, west of Arkansas Highway 39. It consists of two spans of an aluminum-beam substructure, resting on concrete abutments and piers, with textured metal deck plating as the road surface. The bridge was built in 1942, and was probably designed by the engineering staff of the Arkansas State Highway Commission. It is a well-preserved example of a World War II-era bridge. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas ==References== Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Bridges completed in 1942 Category:Buildings and structures in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:1942 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:Road bridges in Arkansas Category:Beam bridges in the United States Category:Metal bridges in the United States ",
