    "text": "Wulfstan (died December 956) was Archbishop of York between 931 and 952. He is often known as Wulfstan I, to separate him from Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York. ==Early life== Wulfstan was consecrated in 931.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 224 He was presumably appointed with the consent of King \u00c6thelstan, and attested all of the king's charters between 931 and 935. Between 936-41, however, he was absent from the king's court, for unknown reasons. ==Career== Wulfstan's career is characterised by frequent swapping of allegiances, both among Viking leaders from Dublin and the Wessex kings. Perhaps Wulfstan played the part of 'king-maker' in Northumbrian politics in the mid-10th century, or perhaps he was guided by self-preservation and the interests of the Church in Northumbria.Downham \"Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland\" In 939, King Olaf Guthfrithson of Dublin invaded Northumbria and occupied York. King Edmund of England marched north to remove Olaf from York, but in 940 Wulfstan and Archbishop Wulfhelm of Canterbury arranged a treaty that ceded the area between Watling Street and the border of Northumbria to Olaf. But Olaf died in late 940, and his rule in York was inherited by his cousin, Olaf Sitricson who became King of J\u00f3rv\u00edk.Stenton Anglo Saxon England p. 357 In 944, Olaf Sitricson and his co-ruler Ragnald Guthfrithson were driven out from York; the chronicler \u00c6thelweard wrote that it was \"Bishop Wulfstan and the eoldormen of the Mercians\" who were responsible for their expulsion. In 947 Wulfstan invited Eric Bloodaxe, the King of Orkney to become King of J\u00f3rv\u00edk. Eadred of Wessex brutally ravaged Northumbria in 948, forcing Eric to leave Northumbria. Olaf Cuaran then resumed his second reign at York. By 951, Wulfstan appears to have supported Eric's claim to the kingdom of York over Olaf as he ceased to witness charters at the English court. In 952, Olaf was driven out by the Northumbrians in favor of Eric. ==Later life== Eadred then re-invaded and imprisoned Wulfstan.Keynes \"Wulfstan I\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle version D says that \"because accusations had often been made to the king against him\", Eadred arrested Wulfstan and took him to Iudanbyrig (the location of which is not known). He attested some charters in 953, so he was not imprisoned then. Although he was restored to episcopal office, he had to exercise his authority from distant Dorchester, from York. He appears not to have attended court for most of 956 and was possibly in failing health by then. According to Lesley Abrams: \"After the sidelining to the treacherous Wulfstan I, Oscytel, a kinsman of Oda, became Archbishop of York in 956.\"Abrams, \"Edgar and the Men of the Danelaw\", p. 189 He died at Oundle, Northamptonshire, on 16 or 26 December 956. He was buried at Oundle. ==Citations== ==References== * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:956 deaths Category:Archbishops of York Category:10th-century archbishops Category:Year of birth unknown ",
