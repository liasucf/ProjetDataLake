Between 1528 - 1707; 1875 - 1885 the islands were conquered by the ships commanded by two Portuguese and one Spaniard: Fernando de Magallanes, Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quir\u00f3s and \u00c1lvaro de Saavedra Cer\u00f3n and (the Spanish domain was from 1528 - 1885). === Gilbert Islands === One of the first recorded \"discoveries\" of the islands by Europeans was in 1528, when Captain Saavedra discovered the island of Tarawa. In 1686, when Francisco de Lezcano arrived on the island Yap and named that archipelago as the Caroline Islands, in honor of King Carlos II of Spain, he extended that name to the islands Palau and those that were later renamed Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. === Phoenix Islands === The Phoenix Islands or Rawaki Islands are a set of sparsely populated atolls located in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Gilbert Islands, west of the Line Islands and north of Samoa. They were discovered and conquered by Magellan in 1520 and remained under Spanish rule until 1899, when by the Treaty of Paris they passed to the United States.Oceandots === Line Islands === Archaeological remains indicate that some of the Line Islands were inhabited by Polynesians, but when the Europeans arrived they were already uninhabited. They were incorporated into the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916. == Diplomatic relations == Spain has had diplomatic relations with Kiribati since 2011 and the Embassy in Wellington, officially opened in June 2009, is accredited in Kiribati. As a member of the states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), Kiribati acceded in 2005 to Cotonou Agreement and receives assistance from EU with the objective of reducing, and in the long term, eradicate poverty and assist in the development of the country. The remote geography and the lack of historical ties explain the very low level of bilateral relations between the two countries, which are mainly channeled through the EU institutions, including development aid.Ficha de Kiribati Office of Diplomatic Information.
