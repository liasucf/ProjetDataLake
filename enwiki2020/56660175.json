De Morier spent the first twelve years of his life in the tiny town of Sanitaria Springs, New York, where his mother owned a small tropical fish store called The Mermaid Aquarium. He spent many years after that in the surrounding Binghamton, New York area, which lead him to use this location in his work later on. He graduated from Walton Central High School, Walton, New York in 1981. He also studied Communication at State University of New York at Cortland and Mechanical Engineering at DeVry University. Lawrence De Morier, Everett's father, died in November 1990, when Everett was twenty- seven. The absence of his father is reflected in many essays he later wrote, including Father\u2019s Day. De Morier moved to Dover, Delaware in 2007 where he lives with his wife Deborah J. De Morier (n\u00e9e Wilkins) and they have two children Nicholas and Alexander. == Career == De Morier started his career as a non-fiction author.
