    "text": "Bijan Ebrahimi was an Iranian refugee living in the UK. For seven years, the 44-year old disabled man had reported death threats and racial abuse from his neighbors. In 2013, Ebrahimi was murdered by his neighbour, Lee James. Lee James had falsely accused Ebrahimi of being a paedophile and beat Ebrahimi to death, later dragging Ebrahimi's body to his home's front yard and setting fire to it. Considered a case of institutional racism, the case drew international media attention. An independent review concluded that Bristol city council and the police were guilty of institutional racism in dealings with Bijan Ebrahimi. Four police and community officers were fired and two were jailed. ==References == Category:2013 murders in the United Kingdom Category:Murder in Bristol Category:Racism in England ",
