His father was in the merchant navy and his mother was a homemaker. Pires studied mathematics at the University of Lisbon, where he published his first short story. He left university to join the Portuguese Navy, from which he was later discharged for disciplinary issues. His writing was greatly influenced by the city of Lisbon, the streets of which are described in great detail in his novels and short stories. Some of his paternal family members immigrated to the United States. Pires connected to American writing styles at a time when Portugal looked to France (and somewhat to north-eastern Brazilian regionalism) for its narrative models. In a documentary produced for Portuguese television, Pires spoke about how after he saw his first film as a boy, it led him to seek refuge in cinemas. Pires would recount the plot of the movie to his peers at school. According to Pires, this helped mold his storytelling. He also talked about the formative role of , or film societies. These generally left-leaning associations, in his words, \"contributed to the political and social education of many people.\" === Publishing career === After his stint in the Portuguese Navy, Pires began working as a journalist and devoted himself to writing. He developed a reputation as an author who was capable of reconciling popularity with critical acclaim. One of his most famous works is a novel titled O Delfim published in 1968. In 1991, he was honored with the Latin Union Prize for Literature in recognition of his literary contributions. His 1997 novel, De Profundis, was inspired by him having a brain ischemia a couple years prior. In that same year, he won the Pr\u00e9mio Pessoa, the most important award in Portuguese culture. Considered as one of the greatest Portuguese writers of the twentieth century, several of his books have been adapted into film. ==List of works== * Os Caminheiros e Outros Contos (1949) * Hist\u00f3rias de Amor (1952) * O Anjo Ancorado (1958) * O Render dos Her\u00f3is (1960) * A Cartilha do Marialva (1960) * Jogos de Azar (1963) * O H\u00f3spede de Job (1963) * O Delfim (1968) * Gente (with Eduardo Gageiro) (1971) * O Dinosauro Excelent\u00edssimo (1972) * E Agora Jos\u00e9 (1977) * O Burro em P\u00e9 (1979) * O Corpo-Delito na Sala de Espelhos (1980) * A Balada de Praia dos C\u00e3es (1987) * Alexandra Alpha (1987) * A Rep\u00fablica dos Corvos (1988) * A Cavalo no Diabo (1984) * De Profundis, Valsa Lenta (1997) * Lisboa Livro de Bordo (1997) ==Film adaptations== *O Delfim, directed by Fernando Lopes *Balada da praia dos c\u00e3es, directed by Jos\u00e9 Fonseca e Costa *Casino Oceano, adaptation of the short story \"Week-End\", directed by Lauro Ant\u00f3nio *O Delfim, directed by Fernando Lopes *A Rapariga dos F\u00f3sforos, adaptation of the story \"Dom Quixote, as Velhas Vi\u00favas e a Rapariga dos F\u00f3sforos\", directed by Lu\u00eds Galv\u00e3o Teles *Ritual dos Pequenos Vampiros, adaptation of the short story \"Jogos de Azar\", directed by Eduardo Geada ==Awards== === Awarded to the author === *Pr\u00e9mio Internacional Uni\u00e3o Latina, Roma, 1991 *Astrol\u00e1bio de Ouro do Pr\u00e9mio Internacional Ultimo Novecento, Pisa, 1992 *Pr\u00e9mio Bordalo de Literatura da Casa da Imprensa, 1994 *Pr\u00e9mio Bordalo de Literatura da Casa da Imprensa, 1997 *Pessoa Prize, 1997 *Grande Pr\u00e9mio Vida Liter\u00e1ria da Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Escritores, 1998 === Awarded to individual works === *Pr\u00e9mio Camilo Castelo Branco, pela Sociedade Portuguesa de Escritores, 1964 (O H\u00f3spede de Job) *Grande Pr\u00e9mio de Romance e Novela, pela Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Escritores, 1982 (Balada da Praia dos C\u00e3es) *Pr\u00e9mio Especial da Associa\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cr\u00edticos do Brasil, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1988 (Alexandra Alpha) *Pr\u00e9mio D.
