    "text": "Henry of Burgundy (c. 1035 - January 27, 1070/1074), called the Gallant (le Damoiseau), was the eldest surviving son and heir of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy, second son of Robert II of France, and his wife, Helie of Semur, granddaughter of Henry I, Duke of Burgundy. Little is known about his life. He died shortly before his father and was never duke himself. The name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and Cl\u00e9mence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from Besan\u00e7on, Sainte-Etienne, naming \"Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy) (possibly ), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry. However, it has been argued by Jean Richard that this is a reference to Sibylla of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy, mother of the then- ruling duke, Hugh II. Richard proposed based on the name's repeated use among the descendants of her son Odo I, Duke of Burgundy that she may have been named Cl\u00e9mence,Richard, Jean (1958). \"Sur les alliances familiales des ducs de Bourgogne aux XIIe et XIIIe si\u00e8cles\". Annales de Bourgogne. 30: 34\u201346, 232. although Odo's wife had a sister, Clementia of Burgundy, who could have been the inspiration for its use among their descendants. Based on the use of the byname Borel by Odo I, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay proposed that his mother was the daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona and his third wife, Guisle of Lluca, and hence granddaughter of Ramon Borrell, Count of Barcelona,Vajay, Szabolcs de (1960). \"Bourgogne, Lorraine et Espagne aux XIe si\u00e8cle: \u00c9tiennette, dite de Vienne, comtesse de Bourgogne\".
