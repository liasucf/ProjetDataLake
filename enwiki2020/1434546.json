    "text": "R.E. Mouscron was a Belgian football club from the municipality of Mouscron, Hainaut. In December 2009 they were declared bankrupt and soon ceased to exist. A new club known as Royal Mouscron-P\u00e9ruwelz was formed in March 2010 and placed in the Belgian Third Division. ==History== The club was the result of the merger between Stade Mouscron and A.R.A. Mouscron in 1964. R.E. Mouscron had financial problems during the 2004\u201305 season and so the president and mayor of Mouscron Jean-Pierre Detremmerie left the club and was replaced by Edward Van Daele. The players with the higher wages were asked to leave the club, as did Marcin \u017bew\u0142akow, Franky Vandendriessche, Geoffrey Claeys, Koen De Vleeschauwer and Alexandre Teklak. In late 2009 Manchester City was ready to spend \u00a33million to save R.E. Mouscron from bankruptcy and use them as a feeder club. On 28 December 2009, Mouscron announced its third forfeit in a row because of enduring financial problems, and was thus, according to Belgian league rules, excluded from competition, with all its previous results in the ongoing competition being scrapped. The club in its current form ceased to exist, with all its players (and staff) becoming free agents. In March 2010 a successor club was formed with the merging of the bankrupt R.E. Mouscron and R.R.C. Peruwelz. The new club is known as Royal Mouscron-P\u00e9ruwelz. ==Honours== *Belgian Second Division: **Runners-up (1): 1993\u201394 *Belgian Second Division Final Round: **Winners (1): 1996 *Belgian Cup: **Runners-up (2): 2001\u201302, 2005\u201306 ==European record== :As of December 2008. {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" |----- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Competition ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Apps ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | P ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | W ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | D ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | L ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | GF ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | GA |----- | UEFA Cup || 2 || 8 || 2 || 3 || 3 || 11 || 15 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" !
