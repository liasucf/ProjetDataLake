The incomplete script and drawings were sold in a book-exhibition in Brussels and is today a part of the book The Mirror World of Asterix. Another reason for its failure is that Goscinny and Uderzo rejected the artists from releasing this movie because of its low quality drawings. *The Twelve Tasks of Asterix is the only animated movie not based (at least loosely) on any of the comic books until the 2018 film The Secret of the Magic Potion. It may not be mentioned in the book, but is adapted from Asterix Conquers Rome. *Starting from 1985's Asterix Versus Caesar the animation quality improved dramatically. *Asterix Conquers America was the only one produced solely outside France. *Early English dubbed versions of cartoon movies used character names from the Ranger/Look and Learn \"Asterix the Briton\" translations, such as Tunabrix for the village chieftain. *Asterix Conquers America, Asterix & the Vikings and Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods are digitally drawn and animated. *Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods is the first Asterix movie in stereoscopy 3D. * The animated Asterix movies that were dubbed into English were all dubbed in the United Kingdom, until the release of Asterix and the Vikings, where it was then dubbed in the United States, in order to bring Asterix into the U.S. market. A North American Dub of Asterix and the Big Fight is used in all DVD releases, although a British dub was available as a VHS release. ==See also== * List of films based on French-language comics ==References== ==External links== *Asterix at the IMDB * Asterix ",
