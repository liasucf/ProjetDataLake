He relocated to the United States to with limited English skills to earn his PhD, studying at the University of Kansas as a Fulbright Scholar. == Career == Farahi began his career at Kean University as a professor in the public affairs master's program. Since joining Kean, questions have been raised about the validity of Farahi's resume. Faculty members at Kean have stated that Farahi's resumes have included \"erroneous claims of publication and other misleading statements.\" After an investigation was launched in 2012, the university's board of trustees voted to retain Farahi by a vote of 7\u20134. During Farahi's tenure, the university has also struggled with maintaining accreditation. In July 2012, the university was placed on probation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education for failing to meet academic standards. In August 2018, it was announced that the public administration master's program would lose its accreditation at the start of the fall semester. In August 2019, it was announced that Farahi would retire at the end of the 2019\u20132020 academic year. == References == Category:Kean University faculty Category:Afghan emigrants to the United States Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:University of Kansas alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
