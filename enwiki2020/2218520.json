Incorporated into the Roman Empire from 15 BC, a Roman road ran along the Krimmler Ache stream up to the Alpine crest. After the Empire's decline in the 5th century, the area became largely Germanised by Bavarian settlers. Initially part of the medieval Duchy of Bavaria, the Chrvmbel manor was first mentioned in a 1228 deed, when the upper Pinzgau region was purchased by the Salzburg archbishops. A parish church was mentioned in 1244. At the time, Krimml was strategically important as a stop on the route connecting Salzburg with the Ahrntal and the County of Tyrol. As in many Salzburg lands where the Protestant Reformation had spread, the peasants in the Krimml area were subject to Counter-Reformation measures enacted by the prince-archbishops and several Protestant families were expelled. After the Archbishopric was secularised, the former ecclesiastical estates finally passed to the Austrian Empire in 1815. From the late 19th century onwards, Alpine tourism gradually became an important economic factor. ==Transport== Krimml railway station Krimml station is the western terminus of the Pinzgauer Lokalbahn narrow-gauge railway line to Zell am See. ==Politics== Seats in the municipal assembly (Gemeinderat): *Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP): 7 *Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6): 5 ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Zell am See District ",
