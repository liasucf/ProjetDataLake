Jin began performing freestyles and selling his own mixtapes on the streets, in hip hop clubs and wherever else possible. While battling on the streets, he was spotted by Kamel Pratt, who then became his manager; together, they formed Crafty Plugz Entertainment. Jin's big break came in 2002 when the BET program 106 & Park invited local rappers to compete in a segment known as Freestyle Friday. Unlike other competitors, Jin occasionally spoke Cantonese in his freestyle verses. After winning seven battles in a row, he was inducted into the Freestyle Friday Hall of Fame. The night of the ceremony, he announced that he had signed a deal with the Ruff Ryders Entertainment label. His first single under Ruff Ryders was titled \"Learn Chinese\".
