Liberty Hall ==History of the first Kenans to come to America== The first Liberty Hall was built by Thomas Kenan in the late 1730s. This home was located on what was then called Turkey Branch Plantation near the present town of Turkey, North Carolina. Thomas Kenan was the first Kenan to emigrate to the United States, sailing from Ireland in 1736 and arriving in Wilmington, North Carolina that same year. Thomas Kenan lived on this plantation until his death in 1766. His wife Elizabeth Johnson Kenan continued to live in the old place until her death in 1789 at which time it passed to their son Gen. James Kenan who named the home Liberty Hall due to the many political meetings and gatherings that took place during this in American history.
