    "text": "1,2,3,5-Tetrahydroxybenzene is a benzenetetrol. It is a metabolite in the degradation of 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (gallic acid) by Eubacterium oxidoreducens. The enzyme pyrogallol hydroxytransferase uses 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (pyrogallol), whereas its two products are 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol) and 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene.Pyrogallol hydroxytransferase at www.uniprot.org == See also == * Trihydroxybenzenes * Pentahydroxybenzene == References == Category:Phenols ",
