The College is operated by the Victorian Department of Education. Established in 1956, the College enrolled, in 2019, approximately 1,500 students from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom less than one percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 65 percent were from a language background other than English. Since 2000, Werribee Secondary College has experienced heavy demand for enrolments at Year 7 and at other levels. To manage this, a ceiling was placed on the total school enrolment. The college established an International Students Program in 2000 and attracts international students. The college has relationships with schools in USA, Spain and Japan. The college was accredited with the Council of International Schools (CIS) in 2006. Since 2013 the College was the first Victorian Government school to offer students the choice of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme alongside the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or VCAL. Students will select the senior programme (VCE, VCAL or IB) which best suits their individual interests and learning styles. ==History== In 1997 the gifted education \"Select Entry Accelerated Learning\" Program or SEAL was introduced. SEAL is the only Department of Education accredited program in the City of Wyndham. The program is for year 7 to year 10. In May 2004 the college was hit by a massive fire that destroyed the school's technology and textiles wing. It caused up to A$2 million damage, including the destruction of students' VCE assignments. Junior students had up to 12 days off school while portable classrooms were brought to the school site. In August 2006 Werribee Secondary College received accreditation from the Council of International Schools. In 2011 Werribee Secondary College became the first state school in Victoria to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma program (it had previously only been available at fifteen private schools). In December 2009 it was reported that four teachers from the school were taking legal action for psychological damage resulting from bullying and harassment by colleagues. Earlier in the same year, another staff member was awarded up to $140,000 in compensation as a result of his treatment by the school. Another case against the school was before the Supreme Court in October 2013. In 2014, a case brought by Peter Doulis against the Department resulted in Doulis being awarded damages and costs in excess of $1.2 million. It was also revealed by The Age in February 2015 that the Principal of the College received a public service medal for his services to public education despite the school being involved in another case whereby a female staff member received a \"six figure damages payout for psychological injuries\" which resulted from her treatment by the school. ==Campus== Following the 2004 fire, over 70% of classes were situated in portable classrooms. In 2005, the college received funding from the Victorian Department of Education for an extension (called the Shirley Cameron Centre) of the College's \"Eca-Centre\" (gymnasium and auditorium) which contained two food technology classrooms, two health classrooms, a canteen and a toilet block as well as new Music Centre. The construction of a new art and technology wing (called the Raymond Findlay Centre) was completed in 2007.
