Her research considers the effectiveness of public health interventions and how to improve developmental assistance for health. Sridhar previously worked at the University of Oxford from 2008. In 2014, she became the founding Director of the University of Edinburgh's Global Health Governance Programme. Sridhar compiled the first Wellcome Trust Open Research Collection on the topic of Global Public Health. Sridhar has written two books, The Battle Against Hunger: Choice, Circumstance and the World Bank (2008) and Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why? (2017). Following the West African Ebola virus epidemic, she worked with the Harvard Global Health Institute and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine assess international responses to the outbreak and use it to better inform preparations with future pandemics. In 2020, Sridhar was part of the Royal Society's Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE) group which inputs into the British Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). She is also a member of the Scottish Government's COVID-19 Advisory Group set up to provide advice on how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. == Early life and education == Sridhar was born and raised in Miami, Florida in an Indian family. After graduating from Ransom Everglades School at the age of sixteen, she enrolled in a six-year program at the University of Miami that awards a bachelor's degree in two years, after which students are in the school of medicine. In an interview with the Lancet, Sridhar explained that her passion for public health stems from her adolescence in Florida, USA, where Sridhar's father died from cancer after years of illness, \u201cEven as a teenager I could see that health was the definition of true wealth\u201d. Having received her bachelor's degree in biology at the age of eighteen, Sridhar became the youngest person in the US to be awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. She spent 8 months of her Oxford doctoral research in India studying malnutrition and infectious diseases in settings that ranged from rural villages to slum housing in Delhi. Her doctoral thesis analysed the effectiveness of the World Bank's effort to combat malnutrition in India. Sridhar turned down a funded position at Harvard Law School to join the University of Oxford Global Economic Governance Programme in 2006, where she was awarded both MPhil and DPhil degrees. She says she was inspired by her grandmother, who raised her children in the 1960s before completing her DPhil and writing several books. ==Career and research== From 2008, Sridhar was a postdoctoral fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. Her doctoral research led to her first book in 2008, The Battle Against Hunger, chosen by Foreign Affairs as a must-read book in aid policy. The book investigated the World Bank funded nutrition programme based in India, which became a blueprint for aid programmes despite lack of evidence for its effectiveness. Sridhar was concerned that the programme did not address the social conditions that cause undernutrition in India. While at Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government, Sridhar analysed the reach, effectiveness, and interdependency of supranational agencies like WHO, other UN health agencies, and organisations such as Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and the World Bank. \u201cThe aim was to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of these organisations, and their comparative advantages and relevance to health ministries, especially in low-income and middle-income countries\u201d, she explained, in an interview with the Lancet. This work informed her 2017 book, co-authored with Chelsea Clinton, Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?. In the book, Sridhar and Clinton argue that health governance is global and that global institutions are necessary to protect citizens and improve health outcomes on a broad scale. In addition, global health governance is changing, with an increasing recognition of the need for intergovernmental cooperation to combat health problems. Sridhar is an Associate Fellow with the Chatham House Centre on Global Health. In 2011, she was appointed to Wolfson College, Oxford as an Associate Professor in global health politics. Sridhar serves on the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on the Health Industry. She started to research the rise of public\u2013private partnerships in global health governance, and how, whilst they are crucial to combat infectious disease, their non-transparent accountability and effectiveness should be investigated. International organisations are redirected by specific incentives, and the asymmetry of information sharing between member states and groups like the World Health Organization or World Bank limits their impact. She worked with Chelsea Clinton and used principal agent theory to study the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the GAVI Alliance. She worked with Julio Frenk on the need for an independent and impartial World Health Organization. At 30 she became Professor of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh. Between 2014 and 2016, Sridhar was on the board of trustees of Save the Children. She regularly contributes to the The Guardian, BBC World Service, CNN, Channel 4 News, and BBC Radio 4. She is a member of Iyiola Solanke's Black Professors Forum. === Ebola and assessing responses to pandemics === Sridhar and colleagues investigated the international response to the West African Ebola virus epidemic, and what reforms were needed to heal a global system for outbreak response. She partnered with the Harvard Global Health Institute and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to independently analyse the global response. They raised questions for the next director general of the World Health Organisation and recommended ten essential reforms to prevent and respond to the next pandemic. In 2014, at the age of thirty, Sridhar was promoted to full Professor and Chair at the University of Edinburgh and became the founding Director of the Global Health Governance Programme. She works between Edinburgh Medical School and the Blavatnik School of Government. Sridhar compiled the first Wellcome Trust Open Research Collection on the topic of Global Public Health. She is concerned by the rise of chronic disease, drug-resistant infection and funding for primary healthcare. === 2020 Coronavirus policy === At the 2018 Hay Festival, Sridhar publicly warned of the risk of infectious disease from animal-to-human transmission travelling to the UK from China, saying \"Our biggest health challenges are interconnected.\" On 28 March 2020, The Lancet published a letter signed by Sridhar and 35 other UK professors, criticising the UK's secretive approach to the COVID-19 epidemic, saying \"we request that the government urgently and openly shares the scientific evidence, data, and models it is using to inform current decision making related to COVID-19 public health interventions...With the UK increasingly becoming an outlier globally in terms of its minimal social distancing population-level interventions, transparency is key to retaining the understanding, cooperation and trust of the scientific and healthcare communities as well as the general public, ultimately leading to a reduction of morbidity and mortality.\"Appendix with names of 36 signatories to 28 March 2020 letter to The Lancet In April 2020, the Royal Society established its DELVE (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics) group, whose membership included Nobel laureates Venki Ramakrishnan and Daniel Kahneman as well as Sridhar. In addition to advising the UK's SAGE team, this group has published data-driven research on COVID, e.g this paper in The Lancet, whose recommendations were summed up in The Guardian by Sridhar as 1) Test, trace, and isolate 2) Give public health guidance on avoiding the virus and 3) Control borders to prevent reimportation. Sridhar similarly in April told an interviewer from The Times that \"The virus is basically here to stay...[Testing] seems like the way to preserve your economy as much as possible.\" Also in April, Sridhar was added to the Scottish Government's \"time limited expert group,\" set up on 25 March 2020, to help develop and improve its COVID-19 response plan. The group is chaired by Edinburgh University professor Andrew Morris.Twitter She is also (since June) a member of its subgroup on Education and Children\u2019s Issues.subgroup on Education and Children\u2019s Issues Sridhar praised the resulting Scottish government strategy to deal with the pandemic, a strategy whose goals are 1) \"to reduce exposure\" and 2) \"to keep daily new cases as low as possible.\" Sridhar also repeatedly contrasted the Scottish Government's response to the pandemic to the strategy used by the British Government in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in England: > Devi Sridhar, who runs the global health governance program at the > University of Edinburgh, noted that the two countries took radically > different approaches from the start: England's priority was to prevent its > hospitals from being overrun, while Scotland's was to drive cases down to > zero. If not for imported cases from the south, Dr. Sridhar said, Scotland > could come close to that goal by the end of the summer. Scotland was widely praised for response adopting a \"zero covid\" policy early on, within the UK. It took a cautious approach to easing restrictions following lockdown compared with England, and was praised for its clear communication of public policy. Sridhar has been criticized by members of the Scottish Conservatives and others for political comments; for example, for her statement on Twitter that \"it is the tragedy of history that when a serious pandemic hit the world where leadership and good governance were required, Donald Trump was US President and Boris Johnson was UK Prime Minister.\" In August, Sridhar used a New York Times op-ed to urge \"strict border measures\" for European countries, to contain the coronavirus. Noting the different coronavirus rates in Scotland and in Northern Ireland versus in England and in Wales she expressed concern that Scotland and Northern Ireland both \"face a stream of incoming infections from England and Wales.\" The \"stream of incoming infections\" comment has been criticised by Scottish unionist parties such as Scottish Liberal Democrats and others. The Scottish Government said Sridhar \"was independent\" and \"did not speak on its behalf.\" In October, Scotland's reproduction rate was no lower than England's, although, according to The Telegraph, \"England remains the worst affected country, with 101 weekly cases per 100,000 up to October 2, compared to 80 in Scotland, .. daily cases are doubling in both nations every nine to ten days.\" On Twitter, Sridhar continued to recommend border checks as a \"front-line\" way to prevent virus entering, with public health guidance to prevent spread of the disease, and test/trace/isolate to control it. Sridhar has been praised by colleagues for her focus on improving public health through addressing health inequities, and through clear and science-based public health policy. In an interview with the Lancet, Lawrence Gostin, Professor and Director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, USA, commented: \"Devi is among the most inspirational and impactful global health leaders in the world\u2026All of Devi's work is guided by the core values of achieving a healthier and safer world with equity and justice. Her work on global governance is exceptional, illuminating the importance of global institutions like WHO, while proposing powerful reforms. Devi is a respected scholar while also being a public intellectual, guiding national and global responses to health threats.\" Sridhar co-authored an open letter in The Lancet (15 October 2020) that has been referred to as the John Snow Memorandum. The letter, which calls for science-based public health policy and rejects \"naturally acquired herd immunity\" as a dangerous fallacy, received 2000 signatures from the science and healthcare community within 24 hours. == Selected publications == Her publications include: * * * * Sridhar serves on the editorial board of the journal Public Health. == References == Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Medical researchers Category:University of Miami alumni Category:American expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh ",
