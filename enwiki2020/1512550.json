    "text": "is the second film based on the popular Bayside Shakedown TV series, known for its unique and humorous depiction of the Japanese police force while avoiding the conventions that define most police dramas. The movie was released in the summer of 2003. Bayside Shakedown 2 is the all-time highest-grossing Japanese live-action movie on domestic screens and earned at the box office. == Plot == The movie takes place again in the fictional Wangan Station of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, in the five years since the previous movie, the once empty space within Wangan's jurisdiction (the station was once referred to disparagingly as \"the empty space station\" by the surrounding jurisdictions) has become a popular tourist attraction, the officers at Wangan Station now have their hands full dealing with all manner of tourist related issues. In a sign of how much has not changed in the last five years, when Detective Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima and several of other detectives playing the part of terrorists defeat a Special Assault Team unit during a counterterrorism exercise in front of the police brass and the media, all the detectives promptly have their pay docked by headquarters. When a string of murders of company execs begins taking place, Aoshima jumps at the opportunity to pursue something other than his current case, which he finds less than inspiring. However the powers that be have other ideas, and Wangan again plays host to a special investigation team from headquarters, led by Superintendent Okita, whose inflexible methods, reliance on technology over old fashioned police work, and condescending attitude towards the locals quickly leads to one fiasco after another, with the local officers working to clean up the resulting mess. Aoshima's friend Superintendent Shinji Muroi, assigned by headquarters to assist Okita, is again powerless to help the local officers as decisions are made by the higher ups. == Credits == ===Cast=== * Y\u016bji Oda - Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima * Toshir\u014d Yanagiba - Superintendent Shinji Muroi * Eri Fukatsu - Sergeant Sumire Onda * Miki Mizuno - Sergeant Yukino Kashiwagi * Y\u016bsuke Santamaria - Inspector Masayoshi Mashita * Miki Maya - Superintendent Okita * Chosuke Ikariya - Senior Inspector Heihachiro Waku * Kenta Satoi - Section Chief Uozumi * Toshio Kakei - Superintendent Shinjo * Kotaro Koizumi - Surveillance Room Operator Shigeru Koike * Soichiro Kitamura - Chief Kanda * Takehiko Ono - Division Chief Hakamada * Satoru Saito - Assistant Chief Akiyama * John Sledge - American in Casino ===Crew=== *Chihiro Kameyama - producer *Kuga Maeda, Daisuke Sekiguchi - assistant producers. *Ryoichi Kimizuka - writer *Katsuyuki Motohiro - director ==Reception== During nine successive weeks it was number-one, a record that hasn't been matched since by a domestic live action film. ==See also== *Bayside Shakedown *Bayside Shakedown: The Movie *List of highest-grossing films in Japan ==References== ==External links== * *Movie Review from lovehkfilm.com Category:2003 films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:Japanese crime comedy films Category:2000s parody films Category:Police detective films Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:Films directed by Katsuyuki Motohiro Category:2000s police comedy films Category:2003 comedy films ",
