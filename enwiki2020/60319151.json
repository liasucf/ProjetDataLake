From > formally dexterous sonnets and sestinas, to epistles and endearing > confessionalism, this is a book that likes to keep readers on their toes. > Something Wilkinson does well is navigate the dark abyss of clinical > depression [...] from \"going about / the tedium that strings our lives / > together: paperchain people, / baskets lined under strip-lights\" ('To David > Foster Wallace'), to shivering over a beige Cornish pasty, \"ticking over / > before some godforsaken motorway service station\" ('You Must Be Joking'), > there is tenderness and touching honesty to be found in the darker moments > he describes. For this reason the collection's title is apt, for its scope > reaches way beyond the boundaries of the football pitch and the fabled buzz > of excitement, which rather serves as a backdrop against which the poet can > stand and inspect the state of his own thumping heart. \\- Jade Cuttle, The > Poetry Review > \u201cI can\u2019t make you feel what I felt\u201d (David Foster Wallace), one of the > epigraphs to Ben Wilkinson\u2019s For Real, is a challenge to which Wilkinson > rises with considerable success. His poems are like doors \u201cwhere no door was > bricked up\u201d; they frequently make us wonder how he got through. The same is > true of his translations, especially \u201cOctober\u201d, a fresh and convincing > version of Verlaine. \\- Andrew McCullouch, The Times Literary Supplement > Whenever I read Ben Wilkinson\u2019s work I find myself admiring his craft. It > carries a precision of thought and expression that\u2019s hard to reproduce, in a > syntax which is natural and a voice which is easy to hear, yet the poems > abound with subtly used devices and effects. Wilkinson disguises his full- > rhymes with enjambment, so the audience experience both form and \u2018natural > flow\u2019 at the same time. He\u2019s always conscious of form, but rarely lets form > dictate to him. \\- Noel Williams, Antiphon == References == == External links == * Author Page Seren Books * Profile Page The Guardian *Poetry London No.61 (Autumn 2008) Two poems by Ben Wilkinson *Times Literary Supplement 'Poem of the Week': 'The Nightingale' by Ben Wilkinson Category:1985 births Category:English poets Category:English critics Category:People from Stafford Category:The Guardian journalists Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:Alumni of Sheffield Hallam University Category:Writers from Sheffield Category:Living people ",
