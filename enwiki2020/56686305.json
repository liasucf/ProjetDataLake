    "text": "Emanuel Rubin (born December 5, 1928) is an American pathologist known for his contributions to the study of liver disease, cardiomyopathy and alcoholic tissue injury, and as the editor of Rubin\u2019s Pathology, a medical textbook first published in 1988, now in its eighth edition. ==Early life and education== Rubin obtained a B.S. degree from Villanova University in 1950, and an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1954. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy from 1955 to 1957. Subsequently, he trained in pathology at the Mount Sinai Hospital from 1958 to 1962. ==Career== Rubin joined the attending staff of Mt. Sinai Hospital in 1962. He was appointed Professor of Pathology in 1968, and Chairman of the Department in 1972, at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. In 1977, he moved to Philadelphia, where he was Chairman of Pathology at Drexel University Medical School. In 1986, he transferred to the Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. He was also appointed Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1987. In 2004, Rubin was named Distinguished Professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology and Chairman Emeritus of the Jefferson Department Rubin has authored numerous original contributions in the fields of liver disease, cardiomyopathy and alcoholic tissue injury. His work has been based on clinical studies of patients, volunteers and laboratory investigations of the effects of alcohol on cells and organs. Rubin originally demonstrated that primary biliary cirrhosis is an inflammatory lesion of bile ducts. His early work refuted concept that liver disease in alcoholics is caused by nutritional deficiencies, which led to the erroneous term \u201cnutritional cirrhosis\u201d. In rodents, sub-human primates and human volunteers he showed that excessive alcohol consumption is toxic to the liver independent of nutritional factors, a fact that serve as the basis of alcohol research today. Subsequently, Rubin and colleagues demonstrated the profound effects of alcohol on cell membranes, mitochondria, and other cell constituents. In a series of papers, together with co-workers in Spain, he determined that (1) alcoholic cardiomyopathy correlated with the lifetime dose of alcohol, (2) women were more susceptible to the cardiac effects of alcohol, and (3) alcoholic liver and heart diseases occurred concurrently. Rubin is the founder and editor of Rubin\u2019s Pathology, a textbook first published in 1988, now in its eight edition. == Awards and honors == * American Medical Writer\u2019s Award for Best Medical Textbook of the Year, 1989 *Doctor Honoris Causa, University of Barcelona, Spain, 1994 * The F.K.
