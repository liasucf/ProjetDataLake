On June 5, Billy Murray and Ed Smalle recorded the most popular version of \"That Old Gang of Mine\" (Victor 19095), which went to #1 on US charts. Other recording artists that charted with the song in 1923 were Benny Krueger and His Orchestra (peaked at #3), Billy Jones and Ernest Hare (peaked at #6), and The Benson Orchestra of Chicago (peaked at #6). The 1923 silent film The Country Kid used the song as its musical theme, and sheet music promoting the film was printed.
