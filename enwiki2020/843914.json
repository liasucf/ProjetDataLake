    "text": "Serotta is an American bicycle builder located in Saratoga Springs, New York. Named after founder Ben Serotta, the company was founded in 1972. Serotta built frames for the Coors, Crest and 7-Eleven pro teams, although Team 7-Eleven bikes were branded as Murray and later Huffy. Serotta also built bikes for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Serotta was known in the industry for its proprietary tube designs and revolutionizing titanium bicycle building. Serotta sold the company in 1989 to Archibald Cox Jr., son of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox Jr. Cox later purchased Fat City Cycles and merged it with Serotta in response to growing interest in mountain biking. In 1997, Ben Serotta and his wife Marcie bought the company back from Cox. Serotta also has a bicycle-fitting system. The Serotta Fit School, started in 1998, trains retailers, coaches and clinicians in a system that incorporates the rider's life, goals, fitness, body, flexibility, motion, experience, injuries, surgeries and physical concerns. In June 2013, Serotta merged with Blue Competition Cycles and Mad Fiber Wheels under the name of Divine Cycling Group. In July 2013, Serotta ceased manufacturing bicycles. In 2015, Ben Serotta helped redesign the Citi Bike for New York City's bike sharing system. In 2017, Ben Serotta returned to selling bicycles under the name of Serotta Design Studio. In 2020, Ben Serotta announced the return of Serotta branded bicycles. ==References== *Frothingham, Stephen April 21, 2017 https://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2017/04/21/ben-serotta-returns- two-bike-projects#.W6p9APlKiUk Bicycle Retailer retrieved 9/25/18 == External links == *Official website of Serotta Competition Bicycles *Official website of Serotta International Cycling Institute (SICI) *Serotta Design Studio Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Saratoga County, New York Category:Saratoga Springs, New York Category:1972 establishments in New York (state) Category:2013 disestablishments in New York (state) ",
