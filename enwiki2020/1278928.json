    "text": "Ian Laperri\u00e8re (born January 19, 1974) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey winger who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Laperri\u00e8re spent nine seasons of his NHL career with the Los Angeles Kings and also spent time with the St. Louis Blues, New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, and Philadelphia Flyers. He is currently an assistant coach for the Flyers. ==Playing career== As a youth, Laperri\u00e8re played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal. Laperri\u00e8re played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) from 1990 to 1993 and was drafted by the St. Louis Blues of the NHL in the seventh round and pick number 158 in the 1992 draft. He made his NHL debut with the Blues on March 3, 1994. On December 8, 1995, he was traded to the New York Rangers for St\u00e9phane Matteau. On March 14, 1996, he was traded with Ray Ferraro, Mattias Norstr\u00f6m, Nathan LaFayette, and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jari Kurri, Marty McSorley and Shane Churla. Laperri\u00e8re was a mainstay on the Kings roster from 1996 until 2004. On July 2, 2004, Laperri\u00e8re signed a free agent contract with the Colorado Avalanche. Laperri\u00e8re, affectionately known as 'Lappy' to his fans, was an immediate success with Colorado in the 2005\u201306 NHL season, posting the best points totals of his career. He scored 21 goals and 24 assists for 45 points, far ahead of his previous bests of 13 goals and 14 assists for 27 points in the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 NHL season. He quickly became a favorite with the Avalanche fans. Laperri\u00e8re scored the 100th goal of his career on October 29, 2006, against the Minnesota Wild. He also passed 800 career games on November 28, against the Calgary Flames in a 5\u20132 loss. On April 1, 2009, Laperri\u00e8re fought with David Hale of the Phoenix Coyotes for his 52nd hockey fight in an Avalanche jersey, passing Scott Parker in all-time franchise fighting majors. He was announced as the Avalanches' Masterton Trophy nominee for the 2008\u201309 season on April 3, 2009. He played in his 1000th NHL game on April 11, 2009, against the Vancouver Canucks in a 0\u20131 home overtime loss. He led the team that year with 163 penalty minutes, just one more minute than Cody McLeod. Unable to agree to a new deal with the Avalanche, Laperri\u00e8re signed a three- year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 1, 2009. On November 27, 2009, Laperri\u00e8re was hit with a slapshot in the mouth while killing a penalty at the end of the first period against the Buffalo Sabres. He sat out the second period receiving between 50 and 100 stitches but returned for the third period. He also played the following night against the Atlanta Thrashers. Laperri\u00e8re lost seven teeth resulting from the incident (two fake and five real). A similar event occurred during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs on April 22. Laperri\u00e8re was hit in the face near the end of a New Jersey power play, resulting in an orbital injury, and a mild concussion. Laperri\u00e8re was listed as out indefinitely and his return to the playoffs was considered unlikely. However, after missing the Flyers second round series versus the Boston Bruins he returned for game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. In the May 2010 edition of The Hockey News Laperri\u00e8re was awarded THN's John Ferguson Award for \"Toughest Player in the NHL\" in the 2009\u201310 season. His postseason play, however, came at a cost; during training camp in September 2010, Laperri\u00e8re experienced symptoms of post-concussion syndrome and nerve damage to his eyes from being hit in the face twice by pucks the previous season, and was announced as out for the entire 2010-11 season just before the season began. He was put on injured reserve before the season began, being placed on long-term injured reserve in mid-December to free up salary cap space, and doctors advised Laperri\u00e8re to retire, although he did not do so at the time. The move was repeated again for the season to free up cap space, as Laperri\u00e8re's symptoms have not subsided; his number 14 was reissued to rookie Sean Couturier. Despite never playing again after the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, Laperri\u00e8re continued to serve the Flyers off the ice as a mentor to younger players in the organization and in other capacities. For that, Laperri\u00e8re was awarded the 2011 Bill Masterton Trophy for his perseverance in the sport of hockey. Laperri\u00e8re officially retired June 12, 2012. He was named Director of Player Development for the Flyers on June 29, 2012. ==Personal life== Laperri\u00e8re is married to Magali and has two sons: Tristan, born in March 2002, and Zachary, born in April 2004. He was sworn in as a naturalized US citizen on August 30, 2011, in a ceremony in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. He portrayed Montreal Canadiens Hall Of Famer Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion in the 2005 Quebec film The Rocket (Maurice Richard) based on the life of the title individual. In 2012, Laperriere appeared in the movie This Is 40 alongside Scott Hartnell, James van Riemsdyk, and Matt Carle. Following his retirement from hockey, he turned his attention to triathlon completing the Ironman North American Championship at Mont-Tremblant (Quebec) in 12 hours, 11 minutes, 55 seconds on August 19, 2013. He also ran the Philadelphia Marathon in 2012. Laperri\u00e8re and his family live in Haddonfield, New Jersey.Philadelphia Flyers 2014-15 Media Guide, p. 21. Accessed November 30, 2017. \"Laperriere and his wife Magali reside in Haddonfield, NJ with their sons Tristan and Zachary.\" ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
