The church was restored in 1878 when the varnish was removed from the roof timbers and the ceiling and walls were painted by T.R. Hibbert of Belper. A screen was erected and the gas lighting extended. The floor of the church was lowered by and the aisles were paved with encaustic tiles. This work was carried out under the supervision of the architect Mr. Robinson of Derby. At the same time the organ, which had formerly stood on the north side, was split either side of the chancel. The work was paid for by local industrialist G.H. Strutt whose liberality enabled the church to be converted into a free and open church. ==Parish status== The parish of Belper Christ Church is part of a joint benefice with the parish of All Saints' Church, Turnditch. ==Organ== The church contains a pipe organ by Brindley & Foster A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. ===Organists=== *Thomas Barker Mellor 1862\u20131871 *James Whitehead 1877\u20131879 *A.
