    "text": "The 2004\u201305 Philadelphia Flyers season was the Flyers' 38th season in the National Hockey League (NHL), however its games were canceled due to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout. The other 29 teams did not play either due to the labor dispute. ==Off-season== After being defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning in 2003\u201304, the Flyers prepared for the looming labor unrest that was to come. While team captain Keith Primeau was re-signed to a four-year contract worth $17 million prior to hitting the free agent market, leading scorer Mark Recchi was not \u2014 general manager Bob Clarke said he would not re-sign Recchi until a new collective bargaining agreement was in place \u2014 and instead signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 9. Unsigned 2001 first-round draft pick R. J. Umberger, whose NHL rights had previously been held by the Vancouver Canucks and New York Rangers, signed with the Flyers as an unrestricted free agent on June 16. The Flyers signed free agent right wingers Mike Knuble of the Boston Bruins and Turner Stevenson of the New Jersey Devils to three-year contracts after the free agency period began. On July 13 undrafted free agent forward Tony Voce, who played four seasons at Boston College, became the first native of Philadelphia to sign with the Flyers. ==Schedule== The Flyers preseason and regular season schedules were announced on July 14, 2004. {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:50%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text- align:center;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#fff; border-top:#F4793E 5px solid; border-bottom:#000 5px solid;\"| 2004\u201305 schedule |- valign=\"top\" | Preseason {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:3%;\"| Game ! style=\"width:3%;\"| Date ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Opponent |- | 1 || September 23 || @ Washington Capitals |- | 2 || September 30 || Washington Capitals |- | 3 || October 2 || @ New York Islanders |- | 4 || October 5 || New York Islanders |- | 5 || October 6 || New Jersey Devils |- | 6 || October 9 || @ New Jersey Devils |- | colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Notes: Neutral site game which was scheduled to be played at Giant Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania |} |- valign=\"top\" | Regular season {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:3%;\"| Game ! style=\"width:3%;\"| Date ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Opponent |- | 1 || October 13 || @ Tampa Bay Lightning |- | 2 || October 14 || @ Florida Panthers |- | 3 || October 16 || @ Montreal Canadiens |- | 4 || October 20 || @ New York Rangers |- | 5 || October 21 || Carolina Hurricanes |- | 6 || October 23 || @ Ottawa Senators |- | 7 || October 25 || Chicago Blackhawks |- | 8 || October 28 || Montreal Canadiens |- | 9 || November 2 || New Jersey Devils |- | 10 || November 5 || @ Buffalo Sabres |- | 11 || November 6 || @ Washington Capitals |- | 12 || November 8 || St. Louis Blues |- | 13 || November 11 || Boston Bruins |- | 14 || November 13 || @ Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 15 || November 17 || New York Islanders |- | 16 || November 19 || Carolina Hurricanes |- | 17 || November 20 || @ Toronto Maple Leafs |- | 18 || November 24 || @ Washington Capitals |- | 19 || November 26 || Atlanta Thrashers |- | 20 || November 27 || @ New York Islanders |- | 21 || November 30 || Tampa Bay Lightning |- | 22 || December 2 || New York Rangers |- | 23 || December 4 || Buffalo Sabres |- | 24 || December 7 || @ Nashville Predators |- | 25 || December 8 || @ Dallas Stars |- | 26 || December 10 || New York Islanders |- | 27 || December 13 || @ Ottawa Senators |- | 28 || December 15 || Boston Bruins |- | 29 || December 16 || @ Boston Bruins |- | 30 || December 18 || New York Rangers |- | 31 || December 21 || Florida Panthers |- | 32 || December 23 || @ Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 33 || December 27 || @ Vancouver Canucks |- | 34 || December 29 || @ Calgary Flames |- | 35 || December 30 || @ Edmonton Oilers |- | 36 || January 2 || @ Chicago Blackhawks |- | 37 || January 5 || @ Minnesota Wild |- | 38 || January 7 || @ Mighty Ducks of Anaheim |- | 39 || January 8 || @ Los Angeles Kings |- | 40 || January 12 || Phoenix Coyotes |- | 41 || January 14 || @ Carolina Hurricanes |- | 42 || January 15 || Buffalo Sabres |- | 43 || January 18 || @ New Jersey Devils |- | 44 || January 20 || Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 45 || January 22 || @ New York Rangers |- | 46 || January 24 || @ Washington Capitals |- | 47 || January 25 || Tampa Bay Lightning |- | 48 || January 29 || Atlanta Thrashers |- | 49 || February 1 || @ New York Islanders |- | 50 || February 3 || Mighty Ducks of Anaheim |- | 51 || February 5 || New Jersey Devils |- | 52 || February 8 || Los Angeles Kings |- | 53 || February 10 || San Jose Sharks |- | 54 || February 15 || @ Montreal Canadiens |- | 55 || February 17 || New Jersey Devils |- | 56 || February 19 || @ New York Rangers |- | 57 || February 20 || Montreal Canadiens |- | 58 || February 23 || @ Carolina Hurricanes |- | 59 || February 24 || Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 60 || February 26 || Colorado Avalanche |- | 61 || February 28 || Ottawa Senators |- | 62 || March 2 || @ Atlanta Thrashers |- | 63 || March 3 || Washington Capitals |- | 64 || March 5 || @ Boston Bruins |- | 65 || March 7 || @ New Jersey Devils |- | 66 || March 8 || @ Toronto Maple Leafs |- | 67 || March 10 || Toronto Maple Leafs |- | 68 || March 12 || Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 69 || March 15 || @ Florida Panthers |- | 70 || March 16 || @ Tampa Bay Lightning |- | 71 || March 19 || @ New Jersey Devils |- | 72 || March 21 || Columbus Blue Jackets |- | 73 || March 23 || @ Buffalo Sabres |- | 74 || March 24 || Ottawa Senators |- | 75 || March 26 || Toronto Maple Leafs |- | 76 || March 28 || New York Islanders |- | 77 || March 31 || @ Atlanta Thrashers |- | 78 || April 2 || @ Pittsburgh Penguins |- | 79 || April 3 || Detroit Red Wings |- | 80 || April 5 || Florida Panthers |- | 81 || April 7 || New York Rangers |- | 82 || April 9 || @ New York Islanders |} |} ==NHL lockout== The lockout started on September 16, 2004 and those Flyers with two-way contracts were sent down to the Phantoms.
