They were the champion of the 2014\u201315 2. Bundesliga (women), but since they failed to get a license to play in the Bundesliga (women), they were not granted a promotion. Due to financial issues, they lost their 2. Bundesliga license and got relegated. They were planned to compete in the BerlinLiga, but also later on pulled out. They will start football activities again in 2017, by competing in the Bezirksliga. == Current squad == ===Former players=== == Honours == * 2.
