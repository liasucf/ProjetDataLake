    "text": "Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as is a lodging located in the town of Jayuya, Puerto Rico. In 1858, Don Eusebio P\u00e9rez del Castillo established the Gripi\u00f1as hacienda (or estate) in the Gripi\u00f1as sector, Veguitas ward, Jayuya. Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as was dedicated mainly to the plantation of coffee and contributed significantly to the growth of this industry in the island during the 19th and 20th century. P\u00e9rez and his wife died late in the 19th century, as the coffee plantation industry decayed in the island because of Hurricane San Ciriaco (1899) and the Spanish\u2013American War (1898). Jaime Oliver Mayol acquired the estate, and in 1904 its coffee product, Caf\u00e9 Gripi\u00f1as, won a \"Grand Prix\" at the St. Louis World's Fair in Louisiana. Miguel A. Sastre Oliver was Jaime Oliver Mayol's grandson. He owned and farmed Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as from 1929 to 197O. Miguel A. Sastre acquired more land and grew the estate to approximately 1,000 \"cuerdas\" before selling the Hacienda to the government of Puerto Rico. In the land where the Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as was located, the government of Puerto Rico divided the area into smaller farms through the Corporaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo Rural de Puerto Rico, and established the Parador Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as (presently operated by the municipal government of Jayuya). Migiel A. Sastre Oliver developed Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as into a sophisticated coffee and dairy farm, and made developments with different fruits, specially avocados. Today, the avocado variety Gripi\u00f1as C-5 is one of the most productive varieties and is widely used in commercial farming in Venezuela and other Latin-American countries. In 1975, the Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as main housing building was remodeled into the Parador Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as lodging, used mostly by tourists visiting the town of Jayuya. Parador Hacienda Gripi\u00f1as is near Cerro de Punta, Puerto Rico's highest mountain, and near the town of Jayuya, famous for the Festival Ta\u00edno, and other events.
