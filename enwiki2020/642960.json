The town had been destroyed in a rebellion, and was lying waste; sometime in the middle of the 9th century, M\u00e2jakas, chief of the Berber Majkasa tribe, resettled it and founded a dynasty that ruled the town until the Umayyads took it over in 931.Sabta, Halima Ferhat, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. 8, ed.
