Capable of operating on both land and water, the DSO started out from a 1959 Heil milk tank trailer and was modified by Dobbertin over the course of 4 1/2 years. On February 23, 1995, the DSO became the first car to transit the Panama Canal. ==References== ==External Links== *Official web site *Video of the DSO from Extra TV (first half, in English) and Good Morning Japan (second half, in Japanese).
