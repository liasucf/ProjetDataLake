The housing estates of Pype Hayes and Castle Vale have witnessed significant regeneration in recent times. Entire estates in Pype Hayes were cleared and replaced with modern housing by Birmingham City Council. Castle Vale was home to one of Europe's largest urban regeneration projects which resulted in the demolition of many tower blocks and low rise flats and the construction of a retail park and semi-detached modern housing. This was done by the Housing Action Trust, established in 1993. The industrial area of Bromford was formerly part of the old Kingsbury Ward most of which was incorporated into the new Tyburn Ward. It has witnessed redevelopment in the form of the construction of the Fort Shopping Centre and the Heartlands Spine Road which connects the A47 Nechells to the A47 Chester Road. ==Population== The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 16,480 people living in Tyburn with a population density of 2,816 people per km\u00b2 compared with 3,649 people per km\u00b2 for Birmingham.
