    "text": "Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae that was named and described by Lorenz Oken in 1816 who placed all the spotted cats in this group. Reginald Innes Pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the species tiger (P. tigris), lion (P. leo), jaguar (P. onca), and leopard (P. pardus) on the basis of common cranial features. Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard (formerly Uncia uncia) also belongs to the Panthera (P. uncia), a classification that was accepted by IUCN Red List assessors in 2008. The tiger, lion, leopard, and jaguar are the only cat species with the anatomical structure that enables them to roar. The primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone. However, new studies show the ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx. The snow leopard does not roar. Although its hyoid bone is incompletely ossified, it lacks the special morphology of the larynx. ==Etymology== The word panther derives from classical Latin panth\u0113ra, itself from the ancient Greek p\u00e1nth\u0113r (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1). The phonetically similar Sanskrit word \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0930 p\u00e2nd-ara means 'pale yellow, whitish, white'. ==Characteristics== In Panthera species, the dorsal profile of the skull is flattish or evenly convex. The frontal interorbital area is not noticeably elevated, and the area behind the elevation is less steeply sloped. The basicranial axis is nearly horizontal. The inner chamber of the bullae is large, the outer small. The partition between them is close to the external auditory meatus. The convexly rounded chin is sloping. All Panthera species have an incompletely ossified hyoid bone. Specially adapted larynx with proportionally larger vocal folds are covered in a large fibro-elastic pad. These characteristics enable all Panthera species except snow leopard to roar. Panthera species can prusten, which is a short, soft, snorting sound; it is used during contact between friendly individuals. The roar is an especially loud call with a distinctive pattern that depends on the species. ==Evolution== The geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia. Panthera blytheae, the oldest known Panthera species, is similar in skull features to the snow leopard. The tiger, snow leopard, and clouded leopard genetic lineages dispersed in Southeast Asia during the Miocene. Genetic studies indicate that the pantherine cats diverged from the subfamily Felinae between six and ten million years ago. The genus Neofelis is sister to Panthera. The clouded leopard appears to have diverged about . Panthera diverged from other cat species about and then evolved into the species tiger about , snow leopard about and leopard about . Mitochondrial sequence data from fossils suggest that the American lion (P. atrox) is a sister lineage to P. spelaea that diverged about . The snow leopard is nestled within Panthera and is the sister species of the tiger. Results of a study based on analysis of biparental nuclear genomes suggest the following relationships of living Panthera species: The prehistoric European jaguar Panthera onca gombaszogensis is probably closely related to the modern jaguar. The first fossil remains were excavated in Olivola in Italy and date to . Fossil remains found in South Africa that appear to belong within the Panthera lineage date to about . ==Classification== During the 19th and 20th centuries, various explorers and staff of natural history museums suggested numerous subspecies, or at times called races, for all Panthera species. The taxonomist Pocock reviewed skins and skulls in the zoological collection of the Natural History Museum, London and grouped subspecies described, thus shortening the lists considerably. Since the mid-1980s, several Panthera species became subject of genetic research, mostly using blood samples of captive individuals. Study results indicate that many of the lion and leopard subspecies are questionable because of insufficient genetic distinction between them. Subsequently, it was proposed to group all African leopard populations to P. p. pardus and retain eight subspecific names for Asian leopard populations. Based on genetic research, it was suggested to group all living sub-Saharan lion populations into P. l. leo. Results of phylogeographic studies indicate that the Western and Central African lion populations are more closely related to those in India and form a different clade than lion populations in Southern and East Africa; southeastern Ethiopia is an admixture region between North African and East African lion populations. Black panthers do not form a distinct species, but are melanistic specimens of the genus, most often encountered in the leopard and jaguar. ===Contemporary species=== The following list of the genus Panthera is based on the taxonomic assessment in Mammal Species of the World and reflects the taxonomy revised in 2017 by the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The upper one is based on phylogenetic studies by Johnson et al. (2006), and by Werdelin et al. (2010). The lower cladogram is based on a study by Davis et al. (2010) and by Maz\u00e1k et al. (2011). The cladogram below follows Maz\u00e1k, Christiansen and Kitchener (2011). In 2018, results of a phylogenetic study on living and fossil cats were published. This study was based on the morphological diversity of the mandibles of saber-toothed cats, their speciation and extinction rates. The generated cladogram indicates a different relation of the Panthera species, as shown below: ==See also== * Pantherinae * Panthera hybrid * Panther (legendary creature) ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Pantherinae Category:Mammal genera Category:Extant Miocene first appearances Category:Taxa named by Lorenz Oken ",
