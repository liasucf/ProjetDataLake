    "text": "Epsilon Leonis (\u03b5 Leo, \u03b5 Leonis) is the fifth-brightest star in the constellation Leo, consistent with its Bayer designation Epsilon. It is known as Algenubi or Ras Elased Australis. Both names mean \"the southern star of the lion's head\". Australis is Latin for \"southern\" and Genubi is Arabic for \"south\". == Properties == Epsilon Leonis has a stellar classification of G1 II, with the luminosity class of II indicating that, at an age of , it has evolved into a bright giant. It is much larger and brighter than the Sun with a luminosity 288 times and a radius 21 times solar. Consequently, its absolute magnitude is actually \u20131.49, making it one of the more luminous stars in the constellation, significantly more than Regulus. Its apparent brightness, though, is only 2.98. Given its distance of about , the star is more than three times the distance from the Sun than Regulus. At this distance, the visual magnitude of Epsilon Leonis is reduced by 0.03 as a result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. Epsilon Leonis exhibits the characteristics of a Cepheid-like variable, changing by an amplitude of 0.3 magnitude every few days. It has around four times the mass of the Sun and a projected rotational velocity of . Based upon its iron abundance, the metallicity of this star's outer atmosphere is only around 52% of the Sun's. That is, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is about half that in the Sun. == See also == * Lists of stars in the constellation Leo * Class G Stars * Variable star * Stars and planetary systems in fiction#Algenubi (Epsilon Leonis) == References == Category:Leo (constellation) Leonis, Epsilon Algenubi Leonis, 17 Category:Classical Cepheid variables Category:G-type bright giants 047908 3873 084441 Category:Suspected variables Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
