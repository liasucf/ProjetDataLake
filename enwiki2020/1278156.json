    "text": "The Toyota Tundra is a pickup truck manufactured in the United States by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota since May 1999. The Tundra was the second full- size pickup to be built by a Japanese manufacturer (the first was the Toyota T-100), but the Tundra was the first full-size pickup from a Japanese manufacturer to be built in North America. The Tundra was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award and was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year in 2000 and 2008. Initially built in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana, production was consolidated in 2008 to Toyota's San Antonio, Texas, factory and is the only full-size pickup truck manufactured in Texas. ==First generation (XK30/XK40; 2000\u20132006)== 2000-2002 Toyota Tundra Access cab SR5 The first generation Tundra had many similarities with the older Toyota T100 and the compact Toyota Tacoma. These included the shared use of a 3.4-liter V6 engine which was the top of the line engine in both the Tacoma and T100. The V6 engine would serve as the base engine for the Tundra, while a second engine was added, a 4.7-liter V8, the first V8 for a Toyota pickup. Publicly introduced in May 1999 as a 2000 model, the Tundra prototypes and \"show trucks\" were initially known as T150s. However, Ford and automotive journalists described the name was too close to the market-leader Ford F-150, and following a lawsuit by Ford, the production truck was renamed the Tundra. Toyota Tundra stepside. The Tundra was slightly larger than the T100. With a production capacity of 120,000, sales were double the rate of the T100. At its introduction, the Tundra had the highest initial vehicle sales for Toyota in its history. It was selected as Motor Trend's Truck of the Year award for 2000 and Best Full- Size Truck from Consumer Reports. It was assembled in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana, with 35 percent still being made in Japan. Engine choices available in the Tundra were a 24V 3.4-liter V6 engine that produced and of torque and an LEV certified 32 valve 4.7-liter \"i-Force\" V8 engine that produced and of torque. A Toyota Racing Development (TRD) supercharger was already available for the 3.4-liter V6 (2000-2003 models) that bumped power to the range and of torque. TRD introduced a second supercharger for the V8 (2000-2003 models) engine late into its second year of production that increased to the mid range and torque to the range. The V6 supercharger is still available, the V8 supercharger ended production once Toyota released the updated VVT-i equipped 4.7-liter engine. 2003-2006 Toyota Tundra regular cab The grille was updated in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), along with a new Stepside bed available on Access Cab models. The Tundra Double Cab, also added to the lineup in 2004, was a crew cab with four rear- opening doors, with interior and exterior details copied from the Toyota Sequoia. Its bed was nearly longer than the competing Honda Ridgeline or Ford F-150. It is also longer, taller, and wider than the Regular and Access Cab versions, with a longer wheelbase. A new engine was introduced in 2005: a 4.0-liter V6 rated at and of torque, and the existing 4.7-liter V8 was updated with Toyota's VVT-i variable valve timing technology and was rated at and of torque while the 2006 versions were rerated at and of torque. The 5-speed manual gave way to a 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic replaced the 4-speed. With a towing capacity of on the Double Cab and on Access Cab and Regular Cab models with a V8 engine, the Tundra still did not have enough power to compete with the heavier-duty offerings of the Big Three. In 2003, the T3 Special Edition was sold in conjunction with the release of the Terminator 3 movie. It included a TRD performance package, \"T3\" badging, blacked out grille and trim pieces, special 17-inch wheels and T3 limited interior trim. 650 were sold in the US as 4x2 and 200 were sold in Canada as 4x4. In 2006, the Darrell Waltrip Edition was marketed to honor the NASCAR driver and his participation in the NASCAR Truck Series. Only 2000 V8-powered Double Cab models were produced. The package included special badging and unique 18-inch wheels. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the Tundra \"Good\" overall in their frontal offset crash test. It was the first full-size pickup awarded a \"Good\" score, its then competitors from Ford and Dodge were rated \"Poor\" and in the case of GM's entry \"Marginal\". ==Second generation (XK50; 2007\u2013present)== ===2007\u20132013=== A larger Tundra was introduced at the February 2006 Chicago Auto Show. It used styling cues from the Toyota Tacoma along with some cues from the Toyota FTX concept truck (also designed by Craig Kember in 2003). The truck featured towing capacity of up to 10,000 lb, and a payload capacity of over , a new 5.7-liter 3UR-FE V8 engine mated to a new 6-speed automatic transmission. The second generation Tundra had three engine options. The new 5.7-liter V8 that produces and of torque, and the carry over 4.7-liter 2UZ-FE V8 rated at and of torque, as well as the previous 4.0-liter 1GR-FE V6 rated at and of torque. 2012 Tundra CrewMax When the new Tundra was first launched in January 2007, it was available in 31 configurations, which consisted of 3 bed lengths, 3 cab configurations, 3 wheelbases, and 2 transmissions. The new Double Cab replaces the previous generation's Access Cab, and the all new CrewMax replaces the previous generation's Double Cab, it is also built to compete with the Dodge Ram Mega Cab. The Double Cab and Regular Cab are available with a regular bed or an long bed, while the CrewMax is only available with a short bed. The Tundra also features a new 6-speed automatic transmission which can lock the torque converter in 5th and 6th gears with a manual shift mode which is standard with the 5.7-liter, giving it a time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter mile time of 14.7 seconds. Toyota made the new Tundra useful for many construction workers by including extra large door handles, deck rail system, integrated tow hitch, and head restraints that can fit a worker with a hardhat. The Tundra also includes as standard: an electronic automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock brakes and tailgate assist. However, its starting price was more expensive than the Chevrolet Silverado Work Truck and the base Ford F-150. Some other changes Toyota included in the new Tundra are optional tow mirrors, a fuel tank, available alloy wheels, backup camera, Bluetooth, large center console (big enough to fit a laptop), extra-large disc brakes and calipers, and the aforementioned 6-speed sequential automatic transmission. All 5.7-liter Tundras come equipped with a tow package which includes engine oil and transmission coolers, integrated trailer hitch, 4.30:1 axle ratio, and large braking hardware for increased fade resistance. Equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 the Tundra has a maximum tow rating of depending on body configuration. Toyota began rating the Tundra under the SAE J2807 protocol beginning in 2010. ====Model year changes==== *The 2008 model added 13 variations bringing the total to 44 model variants. The 2008 models feature additional standard features at a lower price, also include a new \"Tundra Grade\" trim which is slotted below the SR5 trim, and geared toward trades people and the price conscious consumer. *Toyota made E85 fuel capability standard to 2009 Tundra's equipped with the 5.7-liter V8 in select regions. Toyota also updated the TRD Sport package and added a TRD Rock Warrior package. Prices increased 0.4% over the previous 2008 model year. 2010 Tundra Double Cab *The 2010 model year Tundra received visual updates to the grille and tail lamps. A premium Platinum trim level was added. And a new 4.6-liter V8 paired with a 6-speed automatic replaced the previous 4.7-liter 2UZ-FE V8 engine. For added safety, driver and front passenger knee airbags became standard and NHTSA frontal crash test scores improved to five stars. The 2010 Tundra began arriving at dealers in late April 2009. ====Special editions and option packages==== =====Ivan Ironman Stewart Signature Series Tundra===== In June 2008 Toyota introduced the Ivan \"Ironman\" Stewart Signature Series Tundra. Three different packages are offered, one of which includes the TRD Supercharger. As of 2008, Stewart has won the Baja 500 seventeen times driving Toyota vehicles. =====Rock Warrior Package===== For the 2009 model year, Toyota introduced a new off-road themed option package called the TRD Rock Warrior. This option package was only available on the 4x4 Tundras with either the Double Cab or the CrewMax cab. Included in the option group included 17\" TRD forged aluminum wheels, LT285/70R-17 BF Goodrich All-Terrain T/A tires, Bilstein shocks, color matched front bumper and grille, matte-black rear bumper, and fog lights. The interior included black cloth bucket seats, sport shift knob, and pedal covers. Double cab models received a sliding rear window. The TRD Rock Warrior package was only available in Black or Super White. For the 2011 model year, the Rock Warrior package continued with some minor changes. Manual sliding rear window with privacy glass (Double Cab), and TRD Rock Warrior graphics. (Available in the following exterior colors: Black, Radiant Red, Magnetic Gray Metallic or Super White only.) =====Platinum Package===== For the 2010 model year, a new luxury option group called the Platinum package was made available exclusively on CrewMax Tundras. The option package included a chrome front bumper, unique 20-inch aluminum wheels, Platinum badges and a power moon roof. Interior upgrades included a DVD navigation system and backup monitor, JBL sound system with satellite radio and a Bluetooth system, wood grain trim, glass break sensor, and door sill protectors. This option group included heated and ventilated bucket seats with perforated leather trim, power controls and embroidered headrests. For 2010\u20132012, the Platinum was offered as a luxury package. For 2013, the Platinum package was made into a trim level. ====Engines==== =====2007\u20132009 model years===== * 4.0 L V6 GR engine and (California Air Resources Board (CARB) LEV II certified) * 4.7 L V8 UZ engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) * 5.7 L V8 UR engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) =====2010\u20132013 model years===== * 4.0 L V6 GR engine and (CARB LEV II certified) (2010) * 4.0 L V6 GR engine and (CARB LEV II certified) (2011-2013) * 4.6 L V8 UR engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) * 5.7 L V8 UR engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) === 2014\u2013present === 2014 Toyota Tundra CrewMax with TRD option package 2015 Toyota Tundra SR5 CrewMax in Chile On February 7, 2013, the refreshed 2014 Tundra was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show. The redesign featured a larger grille, more enhanced fenders front and rear, a redesigned tailgate and tail lights, as well as a completely redesigned interior. The only sheet-metal carried over from the previous model was the cab and the doors. The hood line was raised to give a more chiseled look and the tailgate includes a spoiler. The interior featured a standard 3.5 inch information screen, bluetooth connectivity, and back up camera. The interior included new seats, new gauges, new controls, updated ergonomics, and a redesigned dashboard with improved materials and metal-look surfaces. Toyota kept the same engines used since the MY 2010 update, a 4.0L V6, a 4.6L V8, and a 5.7L V8. However, the 4.0 L V6 saw a increase in power, and was rated at and . Toyota retuned the suspension with new damping rates to improve the ride quality over the previous models. The steering rack was re-valved to improve the steering feel. The Tundra line-up included a new premium luxury model called the 1794. In total, the 2014 Tundra is available in five trim levels, the SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, and 1794. For the 2014 model year, Toyota discontinued the regular cab Tundra with the box, but other configurations remain the same. ====Model year changes==== *The 2015 model year saw the introduction of a sixth trim level, the Tundra TRD Pro as part of the new TRD Pro family. A rear under seat storage tray was added to SR5 and Limited Double Cab models, and a 3.5\" TFT multi-information display was made standard. The 4.0L V6 was also discontinued. *The 2016 model has an updated front chrome grille on SR5 and 1794 Edition (on 1794 Edition the front bumper center also switched from Silver to Magnetic Gray). A large 38.0 gallon fuel tank option (standard is 26.4 gallons) on 5.7L V8 SR5 models as part of the SR5 Upgrade Package, while it is standard on Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition, and TRD Pro. Flex Fuel (FFV) availability expanded to 4x2 models. An integrated Trailer Brake Controller was added that is standard on all 5.7L V8 models (N/A with the 4.6L V8). Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert availability is also expanded as standard equipment on Platinum and 1794 Edition, while also being available on the SR5 (Safety and Convenience Package, includes front/rear sonar) and Limited (Limited Premium Package).

For the 2014 model year Toyota introduced the 1794 Edition Tundra, designed as a top tier luxury model to compete with the Chevrolet Silverado High Country, GMC Denali, Ford King Ranch and Ram Laramie. The Toyota Tundra plant sits on land that Toyota purchased from the oldest working cattle ranch in Texas. 1794 refers to the year that this ranch was established by Spanish colonist Juan Ignacio de Casanova. The 1794 Edition is a Western themed package which includes Lexus-grade saddle brown leather interior, heated/cooled/powered front seats, wood trimmed steering wheel and dash, power sunroof, blind spot monitoring, an Entune Premium JBL sound system with a navigation system, unique 20\" Alloy wheels and 1794 Badging . The seats on the 1794 are finished in leather and a suede-like material and features contrasting stitching. The dash and door panels also have leather trimmed surfaces along with wood accents. ====TRD Pro==== Toyota Tundra TRD in Chile. For the 2015 Model Year, Toyota introduced the TRD Pro option package to compete with the likes of the Ford SVT Raptor and Ram 1500 Rebel. This is marketed as a highly capable off-road package that is one step above the standard TRD option package. The TRD Pro includes large 2.5\" diameter Bilstein remote reservoir shocks at all four wheels which allow for greater maximum extension of the shocks compared to other Tundra shocks. These shocks allow for an additional of travel in the front and in the rear and employ a three- stage damping that gets progressively firmer as the suspension compresses. These shocks allow the Tundra TRD Pro to have a front ride height that is higher than other Tundras. The front coil springs have a decrease spring rated for more suspension compliance. The TRD Pro also include a thick aluminum front skid plate and a TRD cat-back dual exhaust system. The TRD Pro has a unique body coloured grille with a blacked out center section and the word \"TOYOTA\" on it instead of the Toyota Emblem. TRD PRO logo is stamped into the sides of the pickups bed, while TRD logos are on the shift knob, center console and floor mats. The interior features unique TRD Pro upholstery and door trim with contrasting red stitching and an Etune premium audio system with navigation. Tires included are P275/65-18 Michelin LTX A/T2 tires on black finished alloy wheels that have unique TRD center caps. The TRD Pro is available in three colours: Inferno, Attitude Black Metallic and Super White. The TRD Pro is available as an option only on the Tundra SR5 4x4 in either the Double Cab with the bed or the CrewMax with the bed. For the 2016 model year, the Tundra TRD Pro added Black leather with red contrast stitching and TRD Pro logo. The 38.0 gallon large fuel tank and integrated Trailer Brake Controller was made standard equipment. The color palette was changed to Quicksand (4V6), Magnetic Gray (1G3), and Super White (040). While Super White carried over from 2015, Magnetic Gray (1G3) and Quicksand (4V6) were new. Quicksand was first featured on the FJ-S Cruiser Concept that Toyota and TRD USA used as a test bed for the early TRD Pro Series concept. Quicksand pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser and FJ Cruiser from which the TRD Pro Series inherited its rugged DNA. ====Engines==== =====2014\u20132015 model years===== * 4.0 L V6 GR engine and (CARB LEV II certified) 2014 only * 4.6 L V8 UR engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) * 5.7 L V8 UR engine and (CARB ULEV II certified) ===== Availability ===== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !!

Combined, the two plants give Toyota a maximum capacity to produce 300,000 Tundra units annually or 100,000 units from the Indiana plant and another 200,000 units from the Texas plant. When designing the Texas plant, Toyota arranged for 21 key Tundra suppliers to set up factories on the same site to avoid logistical issues, however those suppliers are more vulnerable to a market downturn. Toyota also included a $9 million health care facility to serve workers and their dependents. The Tundra has 75% North American parts content. In the second quarter of 2008 Toyota moved all Tundra production to the Texas plant. All Tundra engines and transmissions are built in the United States. As sales fell in 2008, production of the Tundra at San Antonio stopped for three months. ===Safety=== The Tundra comes equipped with dual front airbags, front row side torso airbags, and rollover sensing side curtain airbags for both the front and rear rows. Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, anti-lock brakes, brake assist, and electronic brakeforce distribution are also standard. For the 2010 model year, a driver and front passenger knee airbag becomes standard. Toyota's Tundra was the first full-size pickup to have earned the IIHS's Top Safety Pick accolade, followed by the redesigned 2009 Ford F-150. In tests conducted by the IIHS, the Tundra received an overall \"Good\" score in the frontal offset crash test, the highest possible rating in the side impact crash test, and the maximum score for rear crash protection. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ NHTSA crash test ratings (2007): |- |Frontal Driver | |- |Frontal Passenger | |- |Side Driver | |- |Side Rear Passenger | |- |Rollover | |} The primary difference between IIHS and NHTSA frontal crash testing, is the IIHS conducts an offset test where a smaller portion of the vehicle's structure absorbs the energy of the crash. This type of crash test is more demanding on the vehicle's structure, while the full frontal crash test is more demanding on the vehicle's restraint systems. Both IIHS and NHTSA frontal impact tests can only be compared among vehicles of similar weights. Because the Tundra's Vehicle Stability Control system is disabled when the vehicle's 4x4 system is engaged Consumer Reports has questioned the Tundra's Top Safety Pick award. Toyota's response is the Tundra does not feature a center differential which would become a weak point in the drivetrain. However the stability control system remains operational at times when the truck is in 4x2 mode though many drivers will select the 4x4 mode in slippery conditions. As of the 2010 model year this has been corrected. Electronic stability control functions in 4x4hi and is disengaged in 4x4lo. This is verified by the updated owners manual, visor instructions, and road tests in snow and ice in 4x4hi. When understeer or oversteer occurs in 4x4hi a beeping noise is emitted, and the dash indicator lights up yellow indicating that VSC is activated, braking individual wheels to match driver input at the steering wheel. ===TRD supercharger=== Toyota began selling a bolt-on TRD supercharger kit for the 5.7-liter V8 Tundra during June 2008. Power output is increased to and of torque. When the installation is carried out by a Toyota dealership the existing warranty remains intact. This kit features Eaton's TVS Roots-type supercharger which utilizes twin four-lobe rotors, a design shared with the newly introduced Toyota TRD Aurion, Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Cadillac CTS-V. TRD discontinued the TRD Supercharger in mid 2015, meaning that the 2015 model year is the last year that has an official TRD ECU reflash available. Edmunds tested a TRD supercharged Tundra which completed the 1/4 mile in 13.3 sec at . Edmunds previously tested a naturally aspired 5.7-liter V8 Tundra which posted a 14.8 sec at time. Motor Trend's test of the supercharged Tundra resulted in a 1/4 mile of 13.0 sec at . This Tundra needed 4.4 seconds to run from 0-60 mph (97 km/h). ===Awards and comparison tests=== ====Awards==== *CanadianDriver selected the Tundra as \"Truck King\" as the best 1/2-ton pickup with an engine displacing greater than 5.0-liters, and again as best 1/2-ton with an engine displacing less than 5.0-liters. *Trailer Boats awards the Tundra with its 2007 Tow Vehicle of the Year award after completing nearly two weeks of testing. *Truckin' Magazine awards the Tundra Crew Max with its 2008 Truck of the Year award. *Motor Trend selected the Tundra its 2008 Truck of the Year. Other competitors tested were the Chevrolet Silverado HD, GMC Sierra HD, and Ford F-250, F-350 and F-450. While the Chevrolet Silverado, Motor Trend's 2007 TOTY was not in the competition, it was defeated by the Tundra in an earlier three round comparison as noted below. However, Motor Trend ranked the Silverado and Sierra ahead in a later comparison test. *iSeeCars named the Tundra as the pickup truck most original owners keep for 15 Years or more in a 2019 study. ====Media comparison testing==== *May 2009: A Motor Trend comparison test with the Ford F150 Supercrew resulted in a defeat. *April 2009: An Edmunds.com test of 4x4 trucks resulted in a 2nd-place finish for the Tundra. *November 2008: A test conducted by Pickuptrucks.com rated the Tundra 3rd, Motor Trend was asked to join the test and rated the Tundra 5th. *2007: Motor Trend and Truck Trend magazines rate the Tundra ahead of its GM competitor in a three-round battle. Parts of this comparison took place before the Tundra was officially on sale to the public. All sections were published in both magazines. Introduction Round 1: Head-to-Head Round 2: Down and Dirty Final Round - Up, Over, and Out: *2007: Peterson's 4-wheel & Off Road magazine gave the Tundra a 2nd-place finish in their 2008 4x4 of the Year competition. First place went to the Toyota Land Cruiser *August 2007: Consumer Reports rates the Tundra as the 2nd best full-size pickup behind the Chevrolet Avalanche. *April 2007: Car and Driver placed the Tundra 3rd in a 5-truck roundup. *March 2007: Popular Mechanics ranks the Tundra 2nd in a full-size pickup comparison. *January 2007: Edmunds.com places the Tundra first in their 1/2-ton comparison test. ==Recalls and reliability== Replacement frame due to excessive rust on a 2000\u201303 Tundra During late 2009, Toyota issued a recall on 2000-2003 model year Tundras regarding rust problems of a rear crossmember. This recall involved 110,000 vehicles and followed a similar action for the Tacoma. Following the Tacoma voluntary recall Tundra owners began complaining of rust issues. In some cases, trucks were inspected by dealers and found to be unsafe to drive. The dealers refused to let the owners take their vehicles without signing an affidavit that they had been informed that Toyota had declared their vehicles unsafe to drive. Complaints were subsequently brought to WCVB-TV Channel 5 investigative reporter Susan Wornick and the story ran repeatedly in spring and fall 2009 prompting the NHTSA to begin an investigation. NHTSA was particularly concerned that owners reported the potential for the spare tire to drop from the vehicle without warning due to corrosion and they opened an investigation on October 6, 2009. Toyota recalled 2000-2001 Tundras, soon expanding it through 2003. If no rust is detected an anti-corrosion compound will be applied, if rust is detected the crossmember will be replaced. While Toyota originally limited the recall to 20 cold- weather states, problems were already evident elsewhere. In March 2010, the recall was expanded throughout the country. Toyota has been replacing frames on affected vehicles rather than paying the 1.5 times Kelley Blue Book value they offered Tacoma owners in a similar campaign for frame rust in Tacomas. Toyota began replacing frames later in the Tacoma campaign. , Toyota Motor Co. is recalling 533,000 trucks and SUVs because of possible steering and suspension problems caused by faulty ball joints. The recall marks a sudden shift in policy for the Japanese automaker after repeatedly denying consumer complaints about ball joint problems and failures in the Tundra and Sequoia. The Toyota recall includes 2004 to 2007 model year Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicles and 2004 to 2006 Tundra pickups sold in the U.S. A ball joint in the front suspension may wear out causing the vehicles to be difficult or sometimes impossible to steer. Toyota reports that the defect may be the cause of 11 accidents resulting in six injuries. This can cause the wheel to fall off the truck without any notice. In May 2007, a Toyota spokesperson stated 20 camshaft failures occurred in Toyota's all-new 5.7 L 3UR-FE V-8 engine. Toyota said the failures were the result of a flaw in the camshaft casting process, and the supplier of the camshafts has since fixed the error. In the event of a camshaft failure Toyota will either replace the engine and extend the warranty or repurchase the truck from the owner. Toyota originally intended to begin selling the 5.7-liter equipped Tundra during the northern hemisphere summer of 2007 but decided to rush the engine into production in order to match the November 2006 launch date. This decision was the result of product planners and dealers desire for the larger V8's availability at the initial sale. On December 13, 2007, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 15,600 4x4 2007 model-year Tundras in the United States because a rear propeller shaft joint may fail. \"There is a possibility that a joint in the rear propeller shaft may have been improperly heat treated, resulting in insufficient hardness,\" Toyota said. Adding, \"This may cause a section of the rear propeller shaft to separate at the joint.\" There has been one reported case of abnormal noises in the affected vehicles. No accidents have been connected to the recall. Tundra owners will be notified beginning in late-December 2007 and are requested to contact their local Toyota dealer for inspection. If the hardness is not correct the dealer will then replace the rear propeller shaft. The 2007-2010 Tundra was recalled as part of the 2009\u201310 Toyota vehicle recalls for its accelerator pedal. Consumer Reports rated the 2013 Toyota Tundra 2WD pickup as having the highest predicted reliability among all full-size pickup trucks. The Toyota Tundra 4x4 was rated in second, just below the 2WD model. The Toyota Tundra also was the only full-size pickup to make Consumer Reports most reliable new car and most reliable used cars lists. The Toyota Tundra is recommended by Consumer Reports and is the only full-size truck to have an above average reliability rating. ==Sales== After being on the market for more than a decade, the Tundra has about 17% of the full-size half-ton market. In 2000, Toyota sold 107,798 Tundras, compared to the Toyota T100 pickup that sold roughly around 50,000 units. By 2005, Toyota managed to sell 126,529 units. With the added capacity of the San Antonio plant, Toyota planned to sell around 200,000 Tundras for 2007. Toyota missed its sales target for 2007, selling just under 200,000 vehicles. In comparison, for 2007, GMC Sierra sales were over 12,000 more than Tundra, Chevrolet Silverado was more than 422,000 over Tundra, and the Ford F-150 was once again the sales leader with 756,980 units that same year. Around 70-80% of the Tundra sales are the 5.7 L versions, and 46% are the Crew Max. The standard cab versions are selling at a slower rate than expected. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:97%\" |- !Calendar year !U.S. !Canada |- | 2000 | 100,445 | |- | 2001 | 108,863 | |- | 2002 | 99,333 | |- | 2003 | 101,316 | |- | 2004 | 112,484 | |- | 2005 | 126,529 | |- | 2006 | 124,508 | |- | 2007 | 196,555 | |- | 2008 | 137,249 | |- | 2009 | 79,385 | |- | 2010 | 93,309 | |- | 2011 | 82,908 | |- | 2012 | 101,621 |7,241 |- | 2013 | 112,732 |7,535 |- | 2014 | 118,493 |9,769 |- | 2015 | 118,880 |10,829 |- | 2016 | 115,489 |11,364 |- | 2017 | 116,285 |9,442 |- | 2018 | 118,258 |11,738 |- |2019 |111,673 |9,966 |} ===World markets=== As of 2015, the Toyota Tundra is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Bolivia, Chile, and the French territory of New Caledonia in LHD only.

In 2006, the Tundra got Toyota's first manufacturer championship winning 12 of the 25 races. The model also got the driver and owner championship with Todd Bodine and Germain Racing. The truck won every year from 2006 to 2018. ===Pulling the Space Shuttle Endeavour=== On Friday, October 12, 2012, an unmodified, San Antonio-built Toyota Tundra Crew Max pulled the Space Shuttle Endeavour, on top of a special lightweight dolly, across the Manchester Boulevard Bridge (which runs across Interstate 405). The shuttle's journey to the California Science Center was performed by four self-propelled robotic transporters. However, due to bridge weight restriction, the shuttle was moved to the lighter non-powered dolly and towed the short distance by the Tundra. Once it had completely crossed the bridge, the shuttle was returned to the robotic transporters to continue its course. Toyota also used this opportunity to film a commercial that aired during the 2013 Super Bowl. ===Million-mile Tundra=== In 2016, Victor Sheppard of Houma, Louisiana, clocked in over on his 2007 Tundra. In the eight years of owning the truck, he logged in an average of a year and had it serviced at his local dealership a total of 117 times. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. gave Sheppard a 2016 model year Tundra in exchange for his old truck; the company will disassemble it to study its durability and reliability. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Toyota Tundra Global Site Tundra Category:Pickup trucks Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Rear- wheel-drive vehicles Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars Category:2020s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1999 Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States ",
