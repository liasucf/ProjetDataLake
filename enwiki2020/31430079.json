He is the elder brother and guru of Pt. Jasraj and eldest son of Pt. Motiram Pandit. ==Background== Pandit was born at Pilli Mandori in Haryana to an orthodox Brahmin family with strong musical traditions in the Mewati gharana. His father, Pt. Motiram Pandit, died prematurely in 1939, hours before being announced as Osman Ali Khan's new court musician. After his father died, Maniram Pandit became the patriarch of his family and moved them to Hyderabad where he became a court musician and left deep musical roots. He began performing professionally at this point in order to support his family. While Maniram's career grew, he began teaching his younger brother, Pratap Narayan, and tabla to his youngest brother, Jasraj. In 1948, Pandit moved to Calcutta where he lived for two decades. In 1963, Pandit moved with his family to Mumbai. There, Pandit met political resistance from other musicians, like S. N. Ratanjankar. ==Music== Pandit began training with his father, Motiram Pandit, and uncle, Jyotiram Pandit, at age three until the age of 14.https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HqE8rM1IAto/V6A6ZtInxEI/AAAAAAAAFP0/o74rrNKDcGYhwFreIOD- tK0euEZoS2aKACLcB/s1600/back.jpg He was regarded for his vocal range and gamaks. ===Hyderabad Years (c. 1934-1944)=== Pandit's family relocated to Hyderabad as his father was invited to join the Hyderabad Court as a musician. ===Sanand Years (1944-1948)=== Around 1944, Pandit lost his voice and moved his family to Sanand under the patronage of Jaiwant Singhji Waghela, the maharaj of Sanand, himself a student of the Mewati gharana.

After regaining his voice during prayer at Sanand, Pandit acquired a renewed sense of spirituality and became a devotee of Durga. Since, emphasis of religious themes became central to Pandit's music, as evident in his compositions. ===Performance=== Jasraj frequently performed with Maniram from the 1950s onwards.
