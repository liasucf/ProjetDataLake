    "text": "NASCAR Kart Racing is a kart racing video game that was released for the Wii console on February 10, 2009. The game features fourteen real world NASCAR drivers and ten fictional drivers. The cover drivers are, from left to right, Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, and Jimmie Johnson. Other drivers featured in the game are Jeff Burton, Denny Hamlin, Kasey Kahne, Kevin Harvick, Elliott Sadler, and Matt Kenseth. Joey Logano and Richard Petty are unlockable drivers in the game.http://kartracing.easports.com/home.action This would be EA's only NASCAR title produced for 2009 and last game in the EA Sports NASCAR series. Due to low sales numbers for NASCAR 09 and other factors such as a difficulty making new features, the production of the annual simulation-style NASCAR games stopped until Eutechnyx's release of NASCAR The Game: 2011. EA's license as NASCAR's official video game producer expired upon the release of Gran Turismo 5. This game marks the first NASCAR video game released on a Nintendo console since NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup. == Racetracks == There are twelve different racetracks, four of which are real venues. All real venues except Talladega Superspeedway include not only a part of the real track, but a fictional, off-road section. At Daytona International Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway, the finish line is located on the off-road section. At Dover International Speedway, the finish line is located on the real track, but is located just after the crossover from the off-road section. == References == == External links == * * NASCAR Kart Racing at Nintendo's page Category:2009 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Karting video games Category:NASCAR video games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games Category:Wii Wheel games Category:Wii-only games ",
