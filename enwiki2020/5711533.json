It is less congested and has better planned than the other beaches of Goa. == History == During the late 16th century, Candolim became the first village to be entirely converted to Christianity in Bardez by the Franciscans. The present Christian identity of its villagers dates back to the conversion of Santu Sinay (Shenoy), a ganvkar (Konkani: freeholder) who belonged to the nobility of his people. Santu Sinay (1577\u20131640), was the son of Naru Sinay; who had earlier migrated from Loutolim, Salcette, and established himself in Candolim, where he purchased the fifth vangodd (clan) of the comunidade on 13 August 1604. Naru Sinay died after 1624, and was survived by his wife, and three sons\u2014Jeronimo de Souza, Santu Sinay, and Christov\u00e3o d'Andrade. Santu Sinay was converted along with the rest of his family at the age of 8, and subsequently took the name of Salvador Pinto. His godfather was Fr. Manoel Pinto, a Franciscan rector of the Church of Our Lady of Hope of Candolim and the seminary of Reis Magos. He was brought up in the seminary of Reis Magos, where he developed a great devotion to St. Francis Xavier. Salvador Pinto was tutored by two Franciscan priests, Fr. Pinto and Fr. Sim\u00e3o de Nazareth; who succeeded the former as rector of Candolim parish. Salvador Pinto worked zealously to spread Christianity in the village. Fr. de Nazareth held great influence with the Viceroys and in recognition of Salvador Pinto's tremendous work in converting the village, obtained for him many life grants and concessions which are still held by his descendants. Fr. de Nazareth, as representative of Fr. Miguel de S. Bonaventura\u2014Custodian and General Commissioner of East Indies and Diogo Dias, syndic of St. Francis and procurator of His Holiness\u2014granted two perpetual graves in the Candolim Church, to Salvador Pinto and his father-in-law Ant\u00f3nio Pereira in the transept, in front of the altar of Bom Jesus, and also to his wife and mother- in-law, Maria and Catharina Pereira in the transept; her grave located between those of two parishioners, Pedro Sequeira and Francisco de Souza. Candolim was the focal point of the anti-Portuguese revolt of 1787, also called the \"Conspiracy of the Pintos\", because it was spearheaded by priests belonging to the village's Pinto (Shenoy) clan. This revolt occurred due to the continued discrimination of the natives related to positions in clergy and government. This angered the Pinto family who were among the protectors of the Portuguese in Goa and had been awarded a coat of arms in 1770. ==Demographics== India census,http://www.census2011.co.in/data/town/626697-candolim-goa.html Candolim had a population of 8500.

Beginning at Fort Aguada and merging with Calangute Beach towards the end, it is one of the longest beaches in the state.

The main Candolim-Calangute Road is packed with shops and restaurants, but the beach front is free of any commercial activity apart from some water activities. The area around the beach can be termed as resort free as there aren't any resorts there. However, the beach has quite a number of inns. A feature about the Candolim Beach was the ship River Princess, which had been stuck at the shores of the beach since 2000 but has since been removed. == Aguada Fort == The fort was built by the Portuguese way back in 1612 for defense against the Dutch and the Maratha invaders. Along with the fort the church, lighthouse and the barracks of the Aguada Jail have become tourist attractions. ==Citations== ==References== * * * *. ==External links== * Candolim beach Category:Cities and towns in North Goa district Category:Beaches of Goa Category:Beaches of North Goa district ",
