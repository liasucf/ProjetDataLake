    "text": "The ATM-6 and ATM-7 are Austrian off-route anti-tank mines that use Misznay Schardin effect warheads to fire self forging fragments into the sides of armoured vehicles. Both mines are mounted on a pedestal base which is used to aim the mine, and have simple sights to aim the mines. The mines originally could be triggered by a variety of means, including contact wire and infra-red fuses, however as a result of Austrian laws, they now only use command detonation. The ATM-7 is a slightly larger and more powerful mine, capable of projecting a fragment that can penetrate 70 mm of armour at 80 m range, producing a hole approximately 120 mm in diameter. ==Specifications== {|class=wikitable ! || ATM-6 || ATM-7 |- !Length |colspan=2 align=center| 180 mm |- !Diameter |colspan=2 align=center| 320 mm |- !Weight | 13 kg || 14 kg |- !Explosive content | 7.2 kg of Composition B || 9 kg of Composition B |} ==References== * Jane's Mines and Mine Clearance 2005-2006 ==External links== * * Category:Anti-tank mines Category:Weapons of Austria ",
