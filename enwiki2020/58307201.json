His father Thomas was the acknowledged natural son of Sir Robert de Swyllington (died 1391), of Swillington in Yorkshire (between Temple Newsam and Methley, south-east of Leeds), who also held lands around Blythburgh in Suffolk. Sir Robert's son Sir Roger (died 1417) developed his Suffolk holdings: when, in 1428, after a series of deaths, Sir Robert was shown to have entailed his estates upon Thomas Hopton and his heirs, the Yorkshire and Suffolk estates descended around 1430 to John Hopton.C.

Sir George Hopton had left the child in the wardship of four trusted friends, and his executors Sir Robert Clere (c.1453-1529, of Ormesby St. Margaret, Norfolk) and William Eyre became engaged in lengthy Star Chamber proceedings for the recovery of Arthur's rights.The National Archives (UK), Court of Star Chamber, Proceedings (Henry VIII); refs: STAC 2/9, f.241; STAC 2/10, f. 48-49; STAC 2/17/336; STAC 2/25/144 (see Discovery Catalogue). It was then about a decade later that he made his first marriage, to Maud, daughter of Sir Robert Dymoke of Scrivelsby (died 1546). Sir Robert had been knighted on the same occasion as Arthur's grandfather Sir William Hopton, and Robert's maternal grandparents Lionel Welles, 6th Baron Welles and Joan Waterton lay in a fine tomb at Methley, beside Swillington. Sir Robert Dymoke was King's Champion at the Coronations of Kings Richard III, Henry VII and Henry VIII.S. Lodge, Scrivelsby, the Home of the Champions (W.K. Morton, Horncastle/Elliot Stock, London 1893), pp. 56-61 (Internet Archive). This marriage, however, although socially advantageous, produced no surviving children, and by 1518 Arthur Hopton had taken a second wife. The match was no less ambitious, his choice falling upon Anne, daughter of Sir Davy Owen of Cowdray House at Midhurst in West Sussex, a natural son of Sir Owen Tudor (and therefore uncle to King Henry VII).'Owen', in W.

In April 1545 the king's Court of Augmentations granted the bailiwick and keeping of the manor-place, garden and orchard of his manor of Henham to trustees who vested it in Sir Arthur Hopton. The Hall itself was granted by the king to Sir Anthony Rous of Dennington in his demesne as of fee. Sir Arthur therefore conveyed the bailiwick to Sir Anthony in November 1545, by an indenture preserved among the Earl of Stradbroke's muniments. The Tudor mansion was destroyed by fire in 1773.A.I.
