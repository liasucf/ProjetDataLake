    "text": "thumb Ocotea porosa is a species of plant in the Lauraceae, often placed in the related genus Phoebe. It is commonly called imbuia or Brazilian walnut because its wood resembles that of some walnuts (to which it is not related). The tree is a major commercial timber species in Brazil, used for high-end furniture, mostly as decorative veneers, and as flooring. The wood is very hard, measuring 3,684 lbf (16,390 N) on the Janka scale. The wood is also fragrant with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon (also a member of the Lauraceae). The tree is also a popular horticultural tree in subtropical regions of the world. In its native habitat it is a threatened species. Portuguese common names (with variant spellings) include embuia, emb\u00faia, embuya, imbuia, imb\u00faia, imbuya, canela-imbuia. ==Habitat== The tree grows naturally in the subtropical montane Araucaria angustifolia rain forests of southern Brazil, mostly in the states of Paran\u00e1 and Santa Catarina, and in smaller numbers in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.
