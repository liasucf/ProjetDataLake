    "text": "Marquess of Carpio () is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Spain accompanied by the dignity of Grandee, granted in 1559 by Philip II to Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, Lord of Carpio, veintiquatro and first chief of the Royal Stables of C\u00f3rdoba.Real Academia de la HistoriaDiputaci\u00f3n de la Grandeza The title holds dominion and lordship over what is roughly the area of El Carpio in the area of Andaluc\u00eda, Province of C\u00f3rdoba, and was at times also tied to the Se\u00f1orios of Lobr\u00edn and Sorbes. The title lends its name to the House of Carpio. == History == The Marquessate of Carpio has its origins in the Se\u00f1orio del Castillo de Carpio which was founded in 1325 by Garc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez de Sotomayor. The Marquesado del Carpio was originally tied to the title of a Grande de Espa\u00f1a granted by King Phillip II of Spain in 1559. The title was bestowed upon Diego Lopez de Haro y Sotomayor on 20 January 1559 in recognition of his services to the crown, however the Grandeeship may have been revoked or not inherited at some point along the line as another Grandeeship was conferred onto the Marquesado by King Philip IV of Spain in 1640 which was granted to Diego de Haro y Haro, 5th Marquess of Carpio and Count of Morente. It is further unclear whether the first Marquess of Carpio was in fact Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro y Sotomayor. Some sources record Diego L\u00f3pez as the I Marques and others record Diego L\u00f3pez' father Luis M\u00e9ndez de Haro y Sotomayor as the I Marques. What does appear clear is that Luis M\u00e9ndez was indeed the 9th Se\u00f1or del Carpio inheriting the title from his parents and that his son Diego L\u00f3pez was also the Marques. Whether the title was conferred upon the 9th or 10th Se\u00f1or del Carpio appears to be the main question. Luis M\u00e9ndez inherited the Se\u00f1orio del Carpio from his mother Beatriz Portocarrero C\u00e1rdenas in 1528 according to Margarita Cabrera S\u00e1nchez. If the date of the upgrade to a Marquesado is accurately put at 1559, it would seem that the first Marques of Carpio was indeed Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro y Sotomayor which is backed by the Real Academia de la Historia. ==Marquesses of Carpio== # Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro y Sotomayor, 1st Marquess of Carpio # Mar\u00eda de Haro y Sotomayor, 2nd Marchioness of Carpio # Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro Sotomayor y C\u00f3rdoba, 3rd Marquess of Carpio # Beatriz de Haro y Sotomayor, 4th Marchioness of Carpio # Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro y Sotomayor, 5th Marquess of Carpio # Luis M\u00e9ndez de Haro y Guzm\u00e1n, 6th Marquess of Carpio # Gaspar M\u00e9ndez de Haro y Guzm\u00e1n, 7th Marquess of Carpio 7th Marquess of Carpio, 1666 # Catalina de Haro y Guzm\u00e1n, 8th Marchioness of Carpio # Mar\u00eda Teresa \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Haro, 9th Marchioness of Carpio # Fernando de Silva y \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 10th Marquess of Carpio # Mar\u00eda Cayetana de Silva y \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 11th Marchioness of Carpio # Carlos Miguel Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, 12th Marquess of Carpio # Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Ventimiglia, 13th Marquess of Carpio # Carlos Mar\u00eda Fitz-James Stuart y Portocarrero, 14th Marquess of Carpio # Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Falc\u00f3, 15th Marquess of Carpio # Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, 16th Marchioness of Carpio # Carlos Fitz-James Stuart y Mart\u00ednez de Irujo, 17th Marquess of Carpio == See also == *Se\u00f1orio del Castillo de Carpio *List of current Grandees of Spain == References == * Some of the information on this page was translated from its Spanish equivalent.
