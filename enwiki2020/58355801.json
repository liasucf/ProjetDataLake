He has been called \"possibly the West's last mountain man.\" He was the guide for F. V. Hayden's survey of the Teton Range in 1872. Leigh Lake was named for Richard Leigh, and nearby Jenny Lake for his first wife, by Hayden's expedition. He corresponded frequently with his longtime friend, Charles B. Penrose, leaving behind diaries and letters that provide a personal, historical, and geographical documentation of the area. He was mentioned by Theodore Roosevelt in 1892, as a local hunter around Two Ocean Pass. His moniker \"Beaver Dick\" was reportedly given to him by Brigham Young as a tribute to his trapping skills. In 1964, Beaver Dick State Park was established near Rexburg, Idaho. ==References== Category:1831 births Category:1899 deaths Category:American fur traders Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:People from Manchester Category:People from Jackson Hole, Wyoming ",
