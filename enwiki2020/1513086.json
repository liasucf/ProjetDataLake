    "text": "{| |} Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville is a F70 type anti-submarine destroyer of the French Navy (Marine Nationale). The French Navy does not use the term \"destroyer\" for its ships. Thus, some large ships, referred to as \"fr\u00e9gates\" in French, are registered as destroyers. And additionally, some minor ships, referred to as \"avisos\" in French, are registered as frigates. She is the third French vessel named after the 18-19th century politician and admiral Louis-Ren\u00e9 Levassor de Latouche Tr\u00e9ville. ==Service history== In November 2006 and again in June 2010, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville visited London on diplomatic duties, and was moored alongside the Second World War cruiser, . In the summer of 2009, she was filmed in stormy seas as part of the documentary Oceans. A video showing the ship in towering seas was set to the Naval Hymn, Eternal Father, Strong to Save (William Whiting, 1860). Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville departing from Portsmouth Naval Base, UK, 21 September 2009. In the autumn of 2009, while attached to an international force of NATO vessels, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville visited Portsmouth Naval Base in the United Kingdom with vessels of the Dutch, Norwegian, Spanish and Turkish navies. On 15 October 2012, the frigate was moored at Leith Docks in Scotland. On 18 April 2015, she escorted a replica of the 18th century sailing ship as it departed La Rochelle, France on her maiden voyage across the Atlantic to Yorktown, Virginia in the United States. She returned to Brest with the ship on 10 August. In May 2015, Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville was among a dozen surface vessels and four submarines that took part in NATO's annual \"Dynamic Mongoose\" exercise. Amid flaring tensions with Russia, the two-week event in Norwegian waters saw ships under NATO command conducting a variety of anti- submarine warfare operations. On 4 June 2015, she was moored again at Leith Docks in Scotland. On 9 January 2020, she suffered damage in a storm soon after departing from Brest, and returned to port the next day with her top mast missing. The incident also destroyed an electronic warfare pod and damaged the starboard SYRACUSE system. ==References== ==External links== *Clip of in the documentary Oceans Category:Georges Leygues-class frigates Category:Active frigates of France Category:Ships built in France Category:1988 ships ",
