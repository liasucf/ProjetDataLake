    "text": "A Maximal arc in a finite projective plane is a largest possible (k,d)-arc in that projective plane. If the finite projective plane has order q (there are q+1 points on any line), then for a maximal arc, k, the number of points of the arc, is the maximum possible (= qd + d - q) with the property that no d+1 points of the arc lie on the same line. ==Definition== Let \\pi be a finite projective plane of order q (not necessarily desarguesian). Maximal arcs of degree d ( 2 \u2264 d \u2264 q- 1) are (k,d)-arcs in \\pi, where k is maximal with respect to the parameter d, in other words, k = qd + d - q. Equivalently, one can define maximal arcs of degree d in \\pi as non-empty sets of points K such that every line intersects the set either in 0 or d points. Some authors permit the degree of a maximal arc to be 1, q or even q+ 1. Letting K be a maximal (k, d)-arc in a projective plane of order q, if * d = 1, K is a point of the plane, * d = q, K is the complement of a line (an affine plane of order q), and * d = q + 1, K is the entire projective plane. All of these cases are considered to be trivial examples of maximal arcs, existing in any type of projective plane for any value of q. When 2 \u2264 d \u2264 q- 1, the maximal arc is called non-trivial, and the definition given above and the properties listed below all refer to non-trivial maximal arcs. ==Properties== * The number of lines through a fixed point p, not on a maximal arc K, intersecting K in d points, equals (q+1)-\\frac{q}{d}. Thus, d divides q. * In the special case of d = 2, maximal arcs are known as hyperovals which can only exist if q is even. * An arc K having one fewer point than a maximal arc can always be uniquely extended to a maximal arc by adding to K the point at which all the lines meeting K in d - 1 points meet. * In PG(2,q) with q odd, no non-trivial maximal arcs exist. * In PG(2,2h), maximal arcs for every degree 2t, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 h exist. ==Partial geometries== One can construct partial geometries, derived from maximal arcs: * Let K be a maximal arc with degree d. Consider the incidence structure S(K)=(P,B,I), where P contains all points of the projective plane not on K, B contains all line of the projective plane intersecting K in d points, and the incidence I is the natural inclusion. This is a partial geometry : pg(q-d,q-\\frac{q}{d},q-\\frac{q}{d}-d+1). * Consider the space PG(3,2^h) (h\\geq 1) and let K a maximal arc of degree d=2^s (1\\leq s\\leq m) in a two-dimensional subspace \\pi. Consider an incidence structure T_2^{*}(K)=(P,B,I) where P contains all the points not in \\pi, B contains all lines not in \\pi and intersecting \\pi in a point in K, and I is again the natural inclusion. T_2^{*}(K) is again a partial geometry : pg(2^h-1,(2^h+1)(2^m-1),2^m-1)\\,. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * Category:Projective geometry ",
