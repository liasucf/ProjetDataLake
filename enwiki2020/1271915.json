    "text": "Telling Stories is the fifth album by American singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released in 2000 (see 2000 in music). It was her first album in over four years, and her first since Crossroads to be produced or co-produced by David Kershenbaum. A special 2 CD tour edition of this album was also released in May 2000, supporting the tour going on at the time. The album is composed of contemporary rock songs in the first half, and folk songs in the second half. The song \"Unsung Psalm\" was originally written for her previous album, New Beginning, but it didn't make it onto the album. The record marked a return to shorter songs for Tracy; on New Beginning they had been somewhat longer. ==Track listing== All songs written by Tracy Chapman. ==Personnel== *Tracy Chapman \u2013 acoustic guitar, bouzouki, harp, vocals, background vocals, baritone guitar, record producer, mixing, art design ===Additional musicians=== *Alex Acu\u00f1a \u2013 percussion *Rock Deadrick \u2013 vocals, background vocals *Tommy Eyre \u2013 organ, keyboard *Mike Finnigan \u2013 organ *Denny Fongheiser \u2013 percussion, snare drums *Emmylou Harris \u2013 vocals *Howard Hersh \u2013 bass guitar *Steve Hunter \u2013 dulcimer, lap steel guitar, baritone guitar *Larry Klein \u2013 bass guitar *JayDee Mannes \u2013 pedal steel guitar *John Pierce \u2013 bass guitar *Tim Pierce \u2013 acoustic guitar, dobro, mandolin, sitar, baritone guitar *Eric Rigler \u2013 Uillean pipes, low whistle *Scarlet Rivera \u2013 violin *Glenys Rogers \u2013 percussion, vocals, background vocals *Andy Stoller \u2013 bass guitar *Patrick Warren \u2013 keyboard, Chamberlin ===Technical personnel=== *Duane Baron \u2013 engineering, mixing *Tim Hailand \u2013 artwork *Jeri Heiden \u2013 design *John Heiden \u2013 design *Renata Kanclerz \u2013 production coordination *David Kershenbaum \u2013 mixing, production *Martie Kolbl \u2013 production coordination *Curt Kroeger \u2013 assistant engineering *Iki Levy \u2013 drum programming *Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering *Herb Ritts \u2013 portraits *Roger Sommers \u2013 assistant engineering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Position |- |Austrian Albums (\u00d63 Austria) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |- |French Albums (SNEP) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|37 |- |German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|75 |- |Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|26 |} ==Certifications== ;Singles {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=2|2000 |rowspan=2|\"Telling Stories\" |Billboard Adult Top 40 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|8 |- |Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|8 |} ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Albums produced by David Kershenbaum Category:Elektra Records albums Category:Tracy Chapman albums ",
