    "text": "Brachybacterium horti is a species of Gram positive, facultatively anaerobic, white-pigmented bacterium. The cells are coccoid during the stationary phase, and irregular rods during the exponential phase. It was first isolated from soil from a garden in the Guro District of Seoul, South Korea. The species was first described in 2016, and the name is derived from the Latin horti (of/from a garden). The optimum growth temperature for B. horti is 25-37 \u00b0C, but can grow in the 18-37 \u00b0C range. The optimum pH is 7.0, and can grow in pH 6.5-7.5. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Brachybacterium horti at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-positive bacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2016 ",
