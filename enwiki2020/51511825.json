    "text": "Mihail Drume\u0219 (born Mihail V. Dumitrescu; November 26, 1901-February 27, 1982) was an Ottoman-born Romanian prose writer and playwright. He was born into an Aromanian family in Ohrid, a city that formed part of the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet and is now in North Macedonia. His parents were Vasile Dimitrie (later Dumitrescu), a bucket-maker, and his wife Despina (n\u00e9e Gero). The family emigrated to Bal\u0219, in the Oltenia region of the Romanian Old Kingdom. Mihail attended primary school there, followed by high school in Caracal and Craiova, belatedly taking his degree in 1935. He studied at the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University, graduating in 1928. For a time, he was a high school teacher, later moving on to the university system. His first published work appeared in the Craiova magazine Flamura in 1922. His first book, the 1927 Capcana, included short stories and sketches. From 1938 to 1948, he headed Editura Bucur Ciobanu. Drume\u0219 achieved unusual popularity through the novels Sf\u00e2ntul P\u0103rere, first published in 1930, retitled Cazul Magheru from the second printing and running for eighteen; and Invita\u021bie la vals (1939; 34 printings). His work appeared in Ramuri, Adev\u0103rul literar \u0219i artistic, Rampa, Convorbiri Literare, Vremea, Falanga and Universul literar. Drume\u0219 also published theatrical plays: N\u0103luca (1940) and Trei comedii. \u0218coala nevestelor. Calul de curse. Lini\u0219tea so\u021bului (1940). Later in life, he wrote historical novels such as Se revars\u0103 apele (1961) and Codrul Vl\u0103siei (1966), in an attempt to rework his style and epic manner. His output is melodramatic, erotic and has vague social implications. He left behind in manuscript form several plays, radio and television screenplays, dramatizations and memoirs.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. I, p. 526.
