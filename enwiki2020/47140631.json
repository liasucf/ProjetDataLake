For the droll and uninhibited Master Aldrich, whom radio listeners know exceedingly well, has already proven his stature as a cinematic asset in What a Life. And now, in Life With Henry, which arrived yesterday at Loew's Criterion, he displays in his further adventures an incontestable right to \"series\" rank. For pleasant family entertainment, we suggest you make Henry's acquaintance.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1941 films Category:The Aldrich Family films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1941 comedy films Category:Films directed by Theodore Reed Category:Films scored by Friedrich Hollaender ",
