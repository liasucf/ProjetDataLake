His younger brother, , also became a well-known painter. He began his art studies at the precocious age of nine, at the , under the tutelage of Matthijs de Visch. In 1740, he was awarded a second prize for drawing and, in 1741, first prize for all subjects combined. He received a prize for architectural drawing in 1743. From 1748 to 1749, he lived in Paris and Valenciennes, where he was a copyist for a merchant. After returning to Brugge, he was commissioned to paint a large landscape in the Town Hall at Kortrijk, modeled after the work of the Dutch master, Philips Wouwerman. Later, he created some large murals and bas- reliefs, many featuring horses and battlefields. He would eventually produce more than 1200 works, but he always earned his living primarily as an architect and builder. Around 1750 he became an architectural instructor at the Brugge Academie and, from 1775 until his death, he served as its Director; succeeding Jan Garemijn, with whom he occasionally lived. Most of his works are in the collection of the Groeningemuseum. The museum also has two portraits of him; one by Joseph-Beno\u00eet Suv\u00e9e, from 1779, and one by from 1789. ==References== == Sources == * Albert Schouteet, Beknopte geschiedenis van de Vrije Academie voor Schone Kunsten en van de Stedelijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten te Brugge, Brugge, 1967. * Lexicon van West-Vlaamse kunstenaars, Brugge, 1993. * Robert De Laere, \"Paul Jozef De Cock, kunstschilder en Bouwmeester\", in: Heemkundige Bijdragen voor Brugge en Ommeland, 2010, n\u00b0 5. ==External links== Category:1724 births Category:1801 deaths Category:Flemish painters Category:Flemish architects Category:People from Bruges ",
