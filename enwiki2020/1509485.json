From 1944 to 1947, he served with the Royal Air Force in India. He later taught at Manchester University, where he was a founder member of The Peterloo Group. In 1963, he emigrated to Canada, and began teaching at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Skelton was an authority on Irish literature. He is well known for his work as a literary editor; he was a founder and editor, with John Peter, of The Malahat Review, and a translator. Known as a practising Wiccan, Skelton also published a number of books on the subject of the occult and other neopagan religions. Georges Zuk, a purported French surrealist poet, was a heteronym created by Skelton. Writers he influenced include Jordan Stratford. ==Bibliography== ===Poetry=== *Patmos, And Other Poems (1955) *The Poetic Pattern (1956) *Third Day Lucky (1958) *The Cavalier Poets (1960) *Begging the Dialect: Poems and Ballads (1960) *Two Ballads of the Muse (1960) *The Dark Window (1962 *A Valedictory Poem Upon His Departure from Manchester, England, for the New World (1963) *An Irish Gathering (1964) *A Ballad of Billy Barker (1965) *Because of This and Other Poems (1968) *The Hold of Our Hands : Eight Letters to Sylvia (1968) *Selected Poems, 1947\u20131967 (1968) *An Irish Album (1969) *Answers: Poems (1969) *The Hunting Dark (1971) *Private Speech: Messages, 1962\u20131970 (1971) *A Different Mountain, Messages 1962 \u2013 1970: Poems And Photo-Collages (1971) *Remembering Synge (1971) *Musebook (1972) *Three For Herself (1972) *Country Songs (1973) *Time Light (1974) *The Poet's Calling (1975) *The Limners (1975) *Callsigns (1976) *Mystics Mild: Song (1976) *Because of Love (1977) *Three Poems (1977) *Poetic Truth (1978) *Landmarks (1979) *They Call It the Cariboo (1980) *Limits (1981) *Collected Shorter Poems, 1947\u20131977 (1981) *Zuk (1982) *The Paper Cage (1982) *De Nihilo (1982) *Wordsong: Twelve Ballads (1983) *The Collected Longer Poems, 1947\u20131977 (1985) *Distances (1985) *Telling the Tale (1987) *Openings (1988) *Celtic Contraries (1989) *A Formal Music: Poems in Classical Metres (1993) *Popping Fuchsias: Poems, 1987\u20131992 (1992) *A Formal Music: Poems In Classical Metres (1993) *Islands: Poems in The Traditional Forms And Metres Of Japan (1993) *I Am Me: Rhymes For Small (1994) *A Way of Walking : Poems in the Traditional Forms and Metres of Japan (1994) *Wrestling the Angel: Collected Shorter Poems, 1947\u20131977 (1994) *Samhain (1994) *The Edge Of Time: Poems And Translations (1995) *Three for Nick (1995) *One Leaf Shaking: Collected Later Poems, 1977\u20131990 (1996) *A Further Spring: Love Poems (1996) *Lens of Crystal: Poems (1996) *Long, Long Ago (1996) *Love Poems: A Further Spring (1996) *Or So I Say: Contentions and Confessions \u2013 A Happenstance Book (1998) *The Shapes of Our Singing (1999) *The Shapes of Our Singing: A Guide to the Meters and Set Forms of Verse from Around the World (2002) *In This Poem I Am(2007) ===Fiction=== *The Man Who Sang In His Sleep (1984) *The Parrot Who Could (1987) *Fires of the Kindred (1987) *Hanky-Panky and Other Stories (1990) *Higgledy Piggledy (1992) ===Non-fiction=== *John Ruskin: The Final Years (1955) *Teach Yourself Poetry (1963) *The Practice of Poetry (1971) *J.
