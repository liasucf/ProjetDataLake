He was a distant younger relative of Xiahou Yuan and a close friend of Cao Pi, the first emperor of the Cao Wei state. ==Early life== Xiahou Shang was a distant younger relative of Xiahou Yuan and Xiahou Dun, generals who served under Cao Cao, the warlord who rose to power in the late Eastern Han dynasty and laid the foundation for the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period. As a youth, he was already known for being well-versed in planning and strategy. Cao Pi, one of Cao Cao's sons, highly regarded Xiahou Shang and treated him as a close friend.(\u590f\u4faf\u5c1a\u5b57\u4f2f\u4ec1\uff0c\u6df5\u5f9e\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002\u6587\u5e1d\u8207\u4e4b\u89aa\u53cb\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9.(\u9b4f\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u5c1a\u6709\u7c4c\u756b\u667a\u7565\uff0c\u6587\u5e1d\u5668\u4e4b\uff0c\u8207\u70ba\u5e03\u8863\u4e4b\u4ea4\u3002) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Service under Cao Cao== In the 200s,Zizhi Tongjian vols. 63\u201365. when Cao Cao was at war with his rival Yuan Shao for control over northern China, Xiahou Shang served as a major () in Cao Cao's army and led cavalry forces into battle against Yuan Shao and his heirs.

Cao Pi, as Cao Cao's heir apparent, succeeded his father as the King of Wei and Imperial Chancellor of the Han Empire. He first appointed Xiahou Shang as a Regular Mounted Attendant and later promoted him to Commandant of the Central Army (). As a reward for Xiahou Shang's contributions, Cao Pi also enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Pingling Village ().(\u592a\u7956\u5d29\u65bc\u6d1b\u967d\uff0c\u5c1a\u6301\u7bc0\uff0c\u5949\u6893\u5bae\u9084\u9134\u3002\u5e76\u9304\u524d\u529f\uff0c\u5c01\u5e73\u9675\u4ead\u4faf\uff0c\u62dc\u6563\u9a0e\u5e38\u4f8d\uff0c\u9077\u4e2d\u9818\u8ecd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In late 220,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 69. Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the Cao Wei state with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, he elevated Xiahou Shang from a village marquis to a district marquis under the title \"Marquis of Pingling District\" (). Xiahou Shang was also appointed as General Who Attacks the South () and Inspector () of Jing Province, and put in charge of supervising military affairs in the southern frontiers of Wei.(\u6587\u5e1d\u8e10\u963c\uff0c\u66f4\u5c01\u5e73\u9675\u9109\u4faf\uff0c\u9077\u5f81\u5357\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u9818\u834a\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\uff0c\u5047\u7bc0\u90fd\u7763\u5357\u65b9\u8af8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ===Battle of Shangyong=== During this time, Xiahou Shang proposed to Cao Pi to launch an attack on Shangyong Commandery (\u4e0a\u5eb8\u90e1; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei), which was a territory of Cao Pi's rival Liu Bei. Cao Pi approved and ordered him and Xu Huang(\u6587\u5e1d\u5373\u738b\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6643\u70ba\u53f3\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u9032\u5c01\u902f\u9109\u4faf\u3002\u53ca\u8e10\u963c\uff0c\u9032\u5c01\u694a\u4faf\u3002\u8207\u590f\u4faf\u5c1a\u8a0e\u5289\u5099\u65bc\u4e0a\u5eb8\uff0c\u7834\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 17. to lead troops to attack Shangyong Commandery. Xiahou Shang achieved success in his mission and pacified a total of three commanderies and nine counties.

Cao Pi was so pleased that he awarded Sun Quan the title of a vassal king, \"King of Wu\" (), and recognised Sun Quan's claim to the territories in the Jiangdong region and southern Jing Province. Xiahou Shang knew that Sun Quan was only pretending to submit to Wei rule so he urged Cao Pi to maintain his guard against Sun Quan. As Xiahou Shang foresaw, Sun Quan broke ties with Cao Pi in 222 and declared himself the emperor of an independent Eastern Wu (or simply Wu) regime.(\u5b6b\u6b0a\u96d6\u7a31\u85e9\uff0c\u5c1a\u76ca\u8129\u653b\u8a0e\u4e4b\u5099\uff0c\u6b0a\u5f8c\u679c\u6709\u8cb3\u5fc3\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 222, Cao Pi retaliated against Sun Quan by launching the first of a series of campaigns against Wu. He ordered Xiahou Shang, Cao Zhen and others to lead troops to attack Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran, while he was stationed at Wan (\u5b9b; in present-day Nanyang, Henan) to provide backup. Sun Quan ordered his general Zhuge Jin to attack Xiahou Shang. Zhuge Jin deployed his naval forces across different locations in the river. That night, Xiahou Shang ordered some 10,000 troops to split up and board smaller boats to cross the river and launch a stealth attack on Zhuge Jin on both land and water. They scored a major victory over Zhuge Jin as they burnt down the Wu ships and destroyed some Wu camps on the opposite bank of the river.(\u9ec3\u521d\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u8eca\u99d5\u5e78\u5b9b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c1a\u7387\u8af8\u8ecd\u8207\u66f9\u771f\u5171\u570d\u6c5f\u9675\u3002\u6b0a\u5c07\u8af8\u845b\u747e\u8207\u5c1a\u8ecd\u5c0d\u6c5f\uff0c\u747e\u6e21\u5165\u6c5f\u4e2d\u6e1a\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u6c34\u8ecd\u65bc\u6c5f\u4e2d\u3002\u5c1a\u591c\u591a\u6301\u6cb9\u8229\uff0c\u5c07\u6b65\u9a0e\u842c\u9918\u4eba\uff0c\u65bc\u4e0b\u6d41\u6f5b\u6e21\uff0c\u653b\u747e\u8af8\u8ecd\uff0c\u593e\u6c5f\u71d2\u5176\u821f\u8229\uff0c\u6c34\u9678\u4e26\u653b\uff0c\u7834\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. In 223,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70. when an epidemic broke out while Wei forces were laying siege to Jiangling, Cao Pi ordered the Wei forces to pull back, thus bringing an end to the campaign. As a reward for Xiahou Shang's contributions during the campaign, Cao Pi awarded him an additional 600 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number up to 1,900. He also gave Xiahou Shang a ceremonial axe and promoted him to Governor () of Jing Province.(\u57ce\u672a\u62d4\uff0c\u6703\u5927\u75ab\uff0c\u8a54\u52d1\u5c1a\u5f15\u8af8\u8ecd\u9084\u3002\u76ca\u5c01\u516d\u767e\u6236\uff0c\u5e76\u524d\u5343\u4e5d\u767e\u6236\uff0c\u5047\u925e\uff0c\u9032\u70ba\u7267\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. When Xiahou Shang assumed governorship of (northern) Jing Province, the lands were barren and infrastructure was in ruins after years of war. Most of the population have migrated to the lands south of the Han River which were Wu territory. Besides, there were various non-Han Chinese tribes living around Jing Province who occasionally started uprisings and caused trouble for the regional government. After conquering Shangyong Commandery (\u4e0a\u5eb8\u90e1; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei) in 221, Xiahou Shang used it as a bridge to establish contact with the non-Han Chinese tribes living in the lands 700 li to the west and succeeded in pacifying them and gaining their support. Within five to six years, thousands of households pledged allegiance to Wei. In 224, Cao Pi changed Xiahou Shang's marquis title to \"Marquis of Changling District\" ().(\u834a\u5dde\u6b98\u8352\uff0c\u5916\u63a5\u883b\u5937\uff0c\u800c\u8207\u5433\u963b\u6f22\u6c34\u70ba\u5883\uff0c\u820a\u6c11\u591a\u5c45\u6c5f\u5357\u3002\u5c1a\u81ea\u4e0a\u5eb8\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u897f\u884c\u4e03\u767e\u9918\u91cc\uff0c\u5c71\u6c11\u883b\u5937\u591a\u670d\u5f9e\u8005\uff0c\u4e94\u516d\u5e74\u9593\uff0c\u964d\u9644\u6578\u5343\u5bb6\u3002\u4e94\u5e74\uff0c\u5f99\u5c01\u660c\u9675\u9109\u4faf\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ===Family feud=== Xiahou Shang married the younger sister of Cao Zhen, an adopted son of Cao Cao and a close childhood friend of Cao Pi.([\u590f\u4faf]\u7384\uff0c\u723d\u4e4b\u59d1\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9.(\u666f\u61f7\u590f\u4faf\u7687\u540e\u8af1\u5fbd\uff0c\u5b57\u5a9b\u5bb9\uff0c\u6c9b\u570b\u8b59\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u7236\u5c1a\uff0c\u9b4f\u5fb5\u5357\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\uff1b\u6bcd\u66f9\u6c0f\uff0c\u9b4f\u5fb7\u967d\u9109\u4e3b\u3002) Jin Shu vol. 31. In his later years, Xiahou Shang took a concubine, whom he loved dearly. A family feud broke out when Xiahou Shang's concubine started fighting with Cao Zhen's sister to become Xiahou Shang's official spouse. When Cao Pi heard about it, he decided to intervene as a show of support for his fellow members of the Cao clan, so he had Xiahou Shang's concubine executed by strangulation.(\u5c1a\u6709\u611b\u59be\u5b16\u5e78\uff0c\u5bf5\u596a\u9069\u5ba4\uff1b\u9069\u5ba4\uff0c\u66f9\u6c0f\u5973\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u6587\u5e1d\u9063\u4eba\u7d5e\u6bba\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. Xiahou Shang was so upset by his concubine's death that he fell sick and his health started deteriorating. After burying his concubine, he stayed indoors all the time and refused to meet anyone. When Cao Pi heard about it, he remarked, \"Maybe Du Xi had good reason(s) to look down on (Xiahou) Shang.\" Despite this incident, Cao Pi still highly favoured Xiahou Shang because he was a close childhood friend.(\u5c1a\u60b2\u611f\uff0c\u767c\u75c5\u6033\u60da\uff0c\u65e3\u846c\u57cb\u59be\uff0c\u4e0d\u52dd\u601d\u898b\uff0c\u5fa9\u51fa\u8996\u4e4b\u3002\u6587\u5e1d\u805e\u800c\u605a\u4e4b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u675c\u8972\u4e4b\u8f15\u8584\u5c1a\uff0c\u826f\u6709\u4ee5\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u7136\u4ee5\u820a\u81e3\uff0c\u6069\u5bf5\u4e0d\u8870\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 9. ==Death== In 225, when Xiahou Shang became critically ill, he had to be sent back to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, from his post in Jing Province. During this time, Cao Pi personally visited him, held his hand and sobbed with grief. Xiahou Shang died shortly after.
