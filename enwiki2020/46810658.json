    "text": "SkyFire is a planned nanosatellite spacecraft that will fly by the Moon and collect surface spectroscopy and thermography. It is planned to fly on the Space Launch System. ==Mission== Its purpose is that of a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) technology demonstration using a low-cost 6U CubeSat spacecraft. SkyFire will perform a lunar flyby, collecting spectroscopy and thermography for surface characterization, remote sensing, and site selection. The spacecraft includes two deployable solar arrays and will have a total mass of about . SkyFire was selected in April 2015 by NASA's NextSTEP program (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships) and awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin Space systems worth $1.4 million for further development. ==Launch== SkyFire will fly along other 12 CubeSats as a secondary payload mission on the maiden flight of the Space Launch System. ==Propulsion== SkyFire will also demonstrate a low thrust electric propulsion technology called electrospray propulsion to lower the spacecraft's orbit for additional science and technology mission objectives. ==See also== ;The 13 CubeSats flying in the Artemis 1 mission: *Lunar Flashlight will map exposed water ice on the Moon *Near-Earth Asteroid Scout by NASA is a solar sail spacecraft that will encounter a near-Earth asteroid *BioSentinel is an astrobiology mission *SkyFire by Lockheed Martin *Lunar IceCube, by the Morehead State University *CubeSat for Solar Particles (CuSP) *Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map), designed by the Arizona State University *EQUULEUS, submitted by JAXA and the University of Tokyo *OMOTENASHI, submitted by JAXA, is a lunar lander *ArgoMoon, designed by Argotec and coordinated by Italian Space Agency *Cislunar Explorers, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York *Earth Escape Explorer (CU-E3), University of Colorado Boulder *Team Miles, by Fluid & Reason, LLC.
