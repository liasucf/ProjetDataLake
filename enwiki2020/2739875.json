The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that the airline flew the Beech 1900C - a 19-passenger twin-engine turboprop plane - without repairing its right engine, which was consuming excessive amounts of oil. It was later determined that the engine was being operated in accordance with the engine manufacturers specifications for leaks and has been deemed legal. The Billings, Mont., company has scheduled flights in nine states in addition to Montana: Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. It also operates six aircraft repair and maintenance facilities, according to a company website. == References == == External links == * Category:Cargo airlines of the United States Category:Airlines established in 1981 Category:Airlines based in Montana Category:1981 establishments in the United States ",
