    "text": "Norbury is a district in south-west London. It shares the postcode London SW16 with neighbouring districts Streatham and Croydon. Norbury is south of Charing Cross. ==Etymology== The name Norbury derives from North Burh, (North Borough). Some local histories note that this was due to Norbury's position on the northern boundary of the former Manor of Croydon. Others state that it takes its name from a split in the borough of Bensham, one of the former seven boroughs of Croydon. \"Northbenchesham\" became the Northborough, then Norbury; \"Southbenchesham\" later became Thornton Heath. ==History== For most of its history Norbury was rural countryside through which the London to Brighton Way Roman road passed. At Hepworth Road, the intact road, 32 feet wide, was excavated in 1961. Remnants of a metalled ford across the stream were found further south at Hermitage Bridge on the River Graveney which forms part of the boundary between Norbury and Streatham, before flowing on to the River Wandle, then the River Thames. ===Norbury Manor=== By the early thirteenth century, Norbury was a sub-manor within the chief manor of Croydon. The first recorded mention of Norbury Manor was in 1229 when Peter de Bendings conveyed the Manor to John de Kemsing and his wife Idonea and is referred to as the \"lands stretching out either side of the London Road\".Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1269 the Manor comprised 91 acres of arable land in Pollards Hill, 30 acres in Grandon, 55 acres of pasture, 36 acres of heathland, 2 acres of woodland and 17 acres of meadow land.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1337, Norbury Manor was granted to Nicolas de Carew, who also held neighbouring Beddington Manor. The Carew family remained Lords of the Manor of Norbury until 1859 except for a brief interlude during the reign of Henry VIII. Norbury remained rural and agricultural throughout this period. By 1800 most of the land in Norbury was owned by a handful of people; approximately half was owned by the Carew family, and the remaining large landowners were Peter du Cane, Croydon Hospital and Pembroke College.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 ===Victorian period=== At the start of the Victorian period, the population consisted of fifty six people and three main dwellings; the Hermitage, Norbury Manor Farm House and Norbury Hall.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The Hermitage was situated alongside Green Lane and backed onto Hermitage Sports Ground (now Norbury Park). The last resident of The Hermitage was Jenny Hill, a famous music hall performer in the 1890s.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1894 the North Surrey Golf Club built a 90-acre golf club on Hermitage Sports Ground and in 1896 purchased The Hermitage to use as their club house. The following year it was destroyed by fire.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Norbury Manor Farm House was situated on the corner where Norbury Avenue meets Kensington Avenue and was the Norbury Manor House until Norbury Hall was built in 1802.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The Farm House was demolished in 1914. Only Norbury Hall remains, now used as a retirement home and protected as a Grade II listed building.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1859, the first Victorian villa, known as Norbury Villa, was built on the London Road. A second villa followed in 1878, and thereafter followed the construction of clusters of large villas along both sides of the London Road. In 1867, the Committee of Croydon Steeple Chase and Hurdle Races leased approximately 100 acres at Lonesome Farm. The following year, the first Streatham Horse Race meeting was held and a temporary grandstand was built on Northborough Road. The two day meets, held four or five times a year, proved successful and attracted large crowds from London.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 To cater for the crowds, Norbury railway station opened in 1878, built on a railway line which had run through Norbury since 1862. The increased crowds however led to an increase in anti-social behaviour, and local residents lobbied politicians to enact a new law in 1879 banning horse racing within ten miles of Westminster, effectively ending the Streatham Races.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 ===Urbanisation=== By 1900, Norbury was an affluent semi-rural suburb boasting two golf courses and cricket, football, tennis and bowls clubs.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The first shopping parades on the London Road were constructed in 1900 and side roads behind the parades began to be laid out.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Electric trams were introduced in 1901 connecting the town to Purley, however as Croydon trams and London trams used different systems and could not use the same tracks, when going to London passengers had to change in Norbury. During the next thirty years most of the housing in Norbury was constructed, with the houses and roads in different areas forming part of several residential estates. The most notable estate was the Norbury Cottage Garden Estate built in 1901 in thirty acres of land between Northborough Road and Semley Road, and which was the first cottage estate built by the London County Council.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The population of Norbury had risen from 475 people in 1901 to 15,538 by 1931.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 During the second half of the twentieth century, many of the large Victorian villas were demolished and office blocks were built on their sites. Later many of the office blocks were themselves converted into residential apartments. In 1970 Norbury Fire Station was built to replace nearby Streatham Fire Station.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Today, Norbury is a built-up residential area housing a diverse and multi-cultural community. ==Demography== The 2011 census showed that White British was the largest ethnic group at 24% of the population, followed by 13% Black Caribbean, 12% Indian and 12% Other White.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/norbury-e05000158 55% of people living in Norbury were born in England, followed by 5% in India, 4% Pakistan, 4% Jamaica and 2% Kenya.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury The most spoken language apart from English is Polish.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury A majority of the population, namely 52%, identified as Christian followed by 18% as Muslim and 12% of no religion.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury ==Politics== Norbury is part of the Croydon North constituency and the current MP is Steve Reed. The constituency replaced the Croydon North East constituency in 1997 and has returned Labour Party MP's since it was re-instated. Norbury includes two of the twenty-eight wards which make up Croydon London Borough Council. These two wards, both created in 2018, are Norbury and Pollards Hill and Norbury Park.https://www.croydon.gov.uk/aboutus ===Norbury and Pollards Hill=== ===Norbury Park=== ==Nearest places== * Brixton * Streatham * Streatham Common * West Norwood * Crystal Palace / Upper Norwood * Mitcham * Pollards Hill * Thornton Heath * Croydon ==Notable people and residents== * Kingsley Amis (1922\u20131995), novelist * Barloc of Norbury, Middle Ages Catholic saint * Correlli Barnett (1927\u2013), military historian * Edwy Searles Brooks (1889\u20131965), novelist * Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875\u20131912), composer * John Creasey (1908\u20131973), detective-story writer * Janet Francis (1947\u2013), actress * Deryck Guyler (1914\u20131999), actor * Wee Willie Harris (1933\u2013), singer * Will Hay (1888\u20131949), comedian and actor * Libera, boys' choir * Michael Moorcock (1939\u2013), writer and musician * Osh (1995\u2013), singer * Robert Prizeman (1952\u2013), composer * Ralph Reader (1903\u20131982), actor * Stormzy (1993\u2013), rapper * Roxanne Tataei (1988\u2013), singer ==Nearest railway stations== *Norbury railway station *Mitcham Eastfields railway station *Streatham Common railway station *Streatham railway station *Mitcham Junction railway station *Thornton Heath railway station ==In fiction== Norbury is portrayed in a Sherlock Holmes short story, \"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\", as one of the few places in which the detective turned out to be wrong regarding his theories (as referenced in the episode \"The Six Thatchers\" of the BBC-Series \"Sherlock\") Norbury is mentioned in Penelope Fitzgerald's The Beginning of Spring (1988). The character of Nellie Reid, who is central to the plot, but who does not appear until the book's final sentence, is from Norbury; and it is repeatedly mentioned throughout the book in contrast to a very different type of life in Moscow. ==References== Category:Districts of the London Borough of Croydon Category:Districts of the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Districts of the London Borough of Merton Category:Areas of London ",
