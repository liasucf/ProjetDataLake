    "text": "Bedsit Disco Queen: How I grew up and tried to be a pop star is an autobiography written by Tracey Thorn, first published in February 2013. The book received widespread critical acclaim and was a Sunday Times Top Ten bestseller. The book was featured on BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week in March 2013. ==Reception== Writing for The Independent, Fiona Sturges stated that \u201cThorn is about as far removed from typical notions of a successful singer as it's possible to get. Which makes her ideal to report on the pop star experience, and the ever-shifting landscape of the British music scene of the Eighties and Nineties\". In The Times, Lucy Denyer stated that \"It is a beautifully written book, dryly funny and searingly honest about growing up, whether it was discovering feminism, or being slightly out of her depth as a 15-year-old at an Anti-Nazi League rally\". ==References== Category:2013 non- fiction books Category:British autobiographies Category:British memoirs Category:Music autobiographies ",
