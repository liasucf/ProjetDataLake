    "text": "Travels is the Pat Metheny Group's first live album, released in 1983. It won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance. The album consists of live material recorded in July, October, and November 1982, in Philadelphia, Dallas, Sacramento, Hartford, and Nacogdoches (Texas). The Group for this album consisted of Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby, Dan Gottlieb, and guest Nana Vasconcelos. It was voted number 570 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Travels was recorded as part of the tour for the Group's 1982 studio album, Offramp, but also featured previously unrecorded and unreleased songs. In the liner notes for his ECM Rarum compilation album, Metheny expressed great love for the live rendition of \"Are You Going with Me?\" and appreciated the audience for whom it was played in Philadelphia. The track \"Song for Bilbao\", dedicated to audiences in Bilbao, Spain, was often played as an encore. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Pat Metheny \u2013 acoustic and electric guitars, guitar synthesizer * Lyle Mays \u2013 piano, synthesizers, electric organ, autoharp, Synclavier * Steve Rodby \u2013 acoustic and electric bass, bass synthesizer * Danny Gottlieb \u2013 drums * Nana Vasconcelos \u2013 percussion, voice, berimbau Technical staff * Randy Ezratty \u2013 recording ==Charts== Album \u2013 Billboard {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|Billboard Jazz Albums |align=\"center\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|Billboard Pop Albums |align=\"center\"|62 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|Billboard Top Jazz Albums |align=\"center\"|8 |- |} ==Awards== Grammy Awards {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Category |- |align=\"left\"|1984 |align=\"left\"|Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance |- |} ==References== Category:Pat Metheny live albums Category:1983 live albums Category:ECM Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher Category:Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance ",
