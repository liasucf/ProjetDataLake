    "text": "Two involutes (red) of a parabola In mathematics, an involute (also known as an evolvent) is a particular type of curve that is dependent on another shape or curve. An involute of a curve is the locus of a point on a piece of taut string as the string is either unwrapped from or wrapped around the curve. It is a class of curves coming under the roulette family of curves. The evolute of an involute is the original curve. The notions of the involute and evolute of a curve were introduced by Christiaan Huygens in his work titled Horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum ad horologia aptato demonstrationes geometricae (1673). == Involute of a parameterized curve == Let \\vec c(t),\\; t\\in [t_1,t_2] be a regular curve in the plane with its curvature nowhere 0 and a\\in (t_1,t_2), then the curve with the parametric representation \\vec C_a(t)=\\vec c(t) -\\frac{\\vec c'(t)}{|\\vec c'(t)|}\\; \\int_a^t|\\vec c'(w)|\\; dw is an involute of the given curve. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%; |+ | |} Adding an arbitrary but fixed number l_0 to the integral \\Bigl(\\int_a^t|\\vec c'(w)|\\; dw\\Bigr) results in an involute corresponding to a string extended by l_0 (like a ball of wool yarn having some length of thread already hanging before it is unwound). Hence, the involute can be varied by constant a and/or adding a number to the integral (see Involutes of a semicubic parabola). If \\vec c(t)=(x(t),y(t))^T one gets :\\begin{align} X(t) &= x(t) - \\frac{x'(t)}{\\sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}} \\int_a^t \\sqrt{x'(w)^2 + y'(w)^2} \\,dw \\\\\\ Y(t) &= y(t) - \\frac{y'(t)}{\\sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}} \\int_a^t \\sqrt{x'(w)^2 + y'(w)^2} \\,dw \\; . \\end{align} == Properties of involutes == Involute: properties. The angles depicted are 90 degrees. In order to derive properties of a regular curve it is advantageous to suppose the arc length s to be the parameter of the given curve, which lead to the following simplifications: \\;|\\vec c'(s)|=1\\; and \\;\\vec c(s)=\\kappa(s)\\vec n(s)\\;, with \\kappa the curvature and \\vec n the unit normal. One gets for the involute: :\\vec C_a(s)=\\vec c(s) -\\vec c'(s)(s-a)\\ and :\\vec C_a'(s)=-\\vec c(s)(s-a)=-\\kappa(s)\\vec n(s)(s-a)\\; and the statement: *At point \\vec C_a(a) the involute is not regular (because | \\vec C_a'(a)|=0 ), and from \\; \\vec C_a'(s)\\cdot\\vec c'(s)=0 \\; follows: * The normal of the involute at point \\vec C_a(s) is the tangent of the given curve at point \\vec c(s). * The involutes are parallel curves, because of \\vec C_a(s)=\\vec C_0(s)+a\\vec c'(s) and the fact, that \\vec c'(s) is the unit normal at \\vec C_0(s). == Examples == === Involutes of a circle === Involutes of a circle For a circle with parametric representation (r\\cos(t), r\\sin(t)), one has \\vec c'(t) = (-r\\sin t, r\\cos t). Hence |\\vec c'(t)| = r, and the path length is r(t - a). Evaluating the above given equation of the involute, one gets :\\begin{align} X(t) &= r(\\cos t + (t - a)\\sin t)\\\\\\ Y(t) &= r(\\sin t - (t - a)\\cos t) \\end{align} for the parametric equation of the involute of the circle. The figure shows involutes for a = -0.5 (green), a = 0 (red), a = 0.5 (purple) and a = 1 (light blue). The involutes look like Archimedean spirals, but they are actually not. The arc length for a=0 and 0 \\le t \\le t_2 of the involute is : L = \\frac{r}{2} t_2^2. Involutes of a semicubic parabola (blue). Only the red curve is a parabola. === Involutes of a semicubic parabola === The parametric equation \\vec c(t) = (\\tfrac{t^3}{3}, \\tfrac{t^2}{2}) describes a semicubical parabola. From \\vec c'(t) = (t^2, t) one gets |\\vec c'(t)| = t\\sqrt{t^2 + 1} and \\int_0^t w\\sqrt{w^2 + 1}\\,dw = \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{t^2 + 1}^3 - \\frac13. Extending the string by l_0={1\\over3} extensively simplifies further calculation, and one gets : \\begin{align} X(t)&= -\\frac{t}{3}\\\\\\ Y(t) &= \\frac{t^2}{6} - \\frac{1}{3}.\\end{align} Eliminating yields Y = \\frac{3}{2}X^2 - \\frac{1}{3}, showing that this involute is a parabola. The other involutes are thus parallel curves of a parabola, and are not parabolas, as they are curves of degree six (See ). The red involute of a catenary (blue) is a tractrix. === Involutes of a catenary === For the catenary (t, \\cosh t), the tangent vector is \\vec c'(t) = (1, \\sinh t), and, as 1 + \\sinh^2 t =\\cosh^2 t, its length is |\\vec c'(t)| = \\cosh t. Thus the arc length from the point is \\textstyle\\int_0^t \\cosh w\\,dw = \\sinh t. Hence the involute starting from is parametrized by : (t - \\tanh t, 1/\\cosh t), and is thus a tractrix. The other involutes are not tractrices, as they are parallel curves of a tractrix. === Involutes of a cycloid === Involutes of a cycloid (blue): Only the red curve is another cycloid The parametric representation \\vec c(t) = (t - \\sin t, 1 - \\cos t) describes a cycloid. From \\vec c'(t) = (1 - \\cos t, \\sin t), one gets (after having used some trigonometric formulas) :|\\vec c'(t)| = 2\\sin\\frac{t}{2}, and :\\int_\\pi^t 2\\sin\\frac{w}{2}\\,dw = -4\\cos\\frac{t}{2}. Hence the equations of the corresponding involute are : X(t) = t + \\sin t, : Y(t) = 3 + \\cos t, which describe the shifted red cycloid of the diagram. Hence * The involutes of the cycloid (t - \\sin t, 1 - \\cos t) are parallel curves of the cycloid : (t + \\sin t, 3 + \\cos t). (Parallel curves of a cycloid are not cycloids.) == Involute and evolute == The evolute of a given curve c_0 consists of the curvature centers of c_0. Between involutes and evolutes the following statement holds: K. Burg, H. Haf, F. Wille, A.

Band, Springer-Verlag, 1955, S. 267. :A curve is the evolute of any of its involutes. ==Application== The involute has some properties that makes it extremely important to the gear industry: If two intermeshed gears have teeth with the profile-shape of involutes (rather than, for example, a traditional triangular shape), they form an involute gear system. Their relative rates of rotation are constant while the teeth are engaged. The gears also always make contact along a single steady line of force. With teeth of other shapes, the relative speeds and forces rise and fall as successive teeth engage, resulting in vibration, noise, and excessive wear. For this reason, nearly all modern gear teeth bear the involute shape.V. G. A.

Mechanism of a scroll compressor The involute of a circle is also an important shape in gas compressing, as a scroll compressor can be built based on this shape. Scroll compressors make less sound than conventional compressors and have proven to be quite efficient. The High Flux Isotope Reactor uses involute-shaped fuel elements, since these allow a constant-width channel between them for coolant. ==See also== * Evolute * Scroll compressor * Involute gear * Roulette (curve) ==References== ==External links== *Involute at MathWorld Category:Differential geometry Category:Christiaan Huygens Category:Roulettes (curve) ",
