    "text": "The Estate Exchange at 46 Fountain Street, Manchester, England, is a Victorian office block by Thomas Worthington. It was built as Overseers' and Churchwardens' Offices in 1852, with the top two floors being added in 1858. It is a Grade II* listed building as of 3 October 1974. The building is in an \"Italian palazzo style, of red brick with sandstone dressings (and a) slate roof\". Hartwell considers it the best building on Fountain Street: \"Each floor is treated differently and there is a range of oeil-de-boeuf windows in stone frames in the attic.\" ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester *Listed buildings in Manchester-M2 ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Manchester Category:Grade II* listed office buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 1858 ",
