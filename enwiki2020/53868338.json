    "text": "Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Lee clan (August 15, 1696 \u2014 August 23, 1764), alternatively known as Lady Seonhui, was consort to Yeongjo of Joseon and the mother of Crown Prince Sado. She is most well known for advising Yeongjo to execute their son, as the latter suffered serious mental disorders. ==Imperial life== Consort Yeong's royal seal Consort Yeong gave birth to the heir apparent in 1735. Crown Prince Sado was not the first male child to be born to Yeongjo, but the death of Crown Prince Hyojang nearly seven years earlier, meant that the court was particularly pleased to welcome another son. Yeongjo ordered Sado to be brought up in a palace quite far from the main residence, so Consort Yeong did not personally oversee his upbringing. The ladies-in-waiting in charge of looking after the prince apparently slighted Consort Yeong frequently, as they considered her to be of common birth. Consort Yeong's daughter-in-law records that she was affectionate toward her children, but very strict and taught them, \"as if she were not their mother.\" However, she tended to her children personally when they fell ill. When Lady Hyegyeong entered the court to marry Crown Prince Sado, Consort Yeong treated her as one of her own children, despite the fact that Lady Hyegyeong was expected to address Yeongjo's primary wife, Queen Jeongseong, as her mother- in-law. In 1748, Princess Hwapyeong died in childbirth and Consort Yeong is recorded as having grieved excessively. After the death of his primary wife, Yeongjo married his second queen in 1759. Consort Yeong supported his decision to remarry and assisted in preparing the state celebrations. Consort Yeong was aware that Yeongjo disliked the crown prince, an issue that Queen Jeongseong discussed frequently with her. She was also aware that Sado suffered serious mental illness and that he was killing ladies-in-waiting and eunuchs, as Lady Hyegyeong went to her for advice after Sado's first murder in 1757. Though initially Consort Yeong wanted to talk to Sado, Lady Hyegyeong persuaded her not to, as she feared the consequences if Sado found out she had spoken to his mother. In 1760, the crown prince lost his temper at a birthday celebration and cursed at his mother and children. When Sado began to threaten Princess Hwawan to gain more personal freedoms, Consort Yeong attended their meetings, as she feared for her daughter's safety. During one meeting in 1760, she witness Sado threaten to, \"slash Princess Hwawan with [his] sword.\" ==Execution of Prince Sado== On 4 July 1762, Consort Yeong wrote to Lady Hyegyeong in response to the rumour that Crown Prince Sado had attempted to enter the upper palace to kill his father. In the letter, she apologised preemptively to her daughter-in-law. On the same day, she spoke to Yeongjo and advised him that Sado's illness was uncontrollable. She stated that Sado should be removed, but his wife and son should not be killed. After Yeongjo left, Consort Yeong apparently beat her chest and refused to eat. After the execution of her son, Lady Hyegyeong records that Consort Yeong transferred her love to her grandson. Yi San moved into the upper palace and slept in the same room as Consort Yeong, who organised his meals and study sessions. ==Death== Consort Yeong developed a tumor on her back and died on 23 August 1764. In the opinion of her daughter-in-law, however, Consort Yeong's intense grief after the execution of her son also weakened her. ==Family== *Father: Lee Yupen (\uc774\uc720\ubc88) *Mother: Lady Jeongyeong of the Hanyang Kim clan (\uc815\uacbd\ubd80\uc778 \ud55c\uc591\uae40\uc528) *Husband: Yi Geum, King Yeongjo of Joseon (31 October 1694 \u2013 22 April 1776) (\uc870\uc120 \uc601\uc870) **Daughter: Princess Hwapyeong (27 April 1727 \u2013 24 June 1748) (\ud654\ud3c9\uc639\uc8fc) ***Son-in-law: Geumseongwi Park Myeong-won (\uae08\uc131\uc704 \ubc15\uba85\uc6d0) **Daughter: (1728 \u2013 1731) **Daughter: (1729 \u2013 1731) **Daughter: (1732 \u2013 1736) **Daughter: Princess Hwahyeop (1733 \u2013 1752) (\ud654\ud611\uc639\uc8fc) ***Son-in-law: Yeongseongwi Shin Gwang-su (\uc601\uc131\uc704 \uc2e0\uad11\uc218) **Son: Yi Seon, Crown Prince Sado (13 February 1735 \u2013 12 July 1762) (\uc774\uc120 \uc0ac\ub3c4\uc138\uc790) ***Daughter-in-law: Princess Consort Hyegyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (6 August 1735 \u2013 13 January 1816) (\ud61c\uacbd\uad81 \ud64d\uc528) **Daughter: Princess Hwawan (9 March 1738 \u2013 10 June 1808) (\ud654\uc644\uc639\uc8fc) ***Son-in-law: Ilseongwi Jeong Jidal (1732 \u2013 1757) (\uc77c\uc131\uc704 \uc815\uce58\ub2ec) ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Kim Yoon Kyung in the 1988 MBC TV series 500 Years of Joseon:Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong *Portrayed by Jung Hye-sun in the 1998 MBC TV series The King's Road *Portrayed by Jeon Hye-jin in the 2015 film The Throne ==References== ===Notes=== ===Works cited=== * Category:Joseon Dynasty people Category:17th-century Korean people Category:18th-century Korean people Category:1696 births Category:1764 deaths Category:Joseon Dynasty harem Category:18th-century Korean women Category:17th-century Korean women ",
