    "text": "Under the Public Health Acts 1873 and 1875 the Poor Law Unions were used as the basis for sanitary districts. All municipal boroughs and areas with bodies such as improvement commissioners became Urban Sanitary Districts. (Any area which acquired borough or urban status after the Act also became at that point an Urban Sanitary District). The remaining areas of the country - i.e., the Unions minus the urban areas - became Rural Sanitary Districts. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts in Dorset were succeeded by Urban Districts and Rural Districts. ==Sanitary districts in Dorset between 1875 and 1894== *RSD - Rural Sanitary District *USD - Urban Sanitary District ===Axminster RSD=== In Devon but also covered the following parishes, then in Dorset: *Chardstock *Hawkchurch ===Beaminster RSD=== Dorset: *Beaminster, Bettiscombe, Broadwindsor, Burstock *Chedington, Corscombe *East Chelborough, Evershot *Halstock, Hooke *Mapperton, Marshwood, Melbury Osmond, Melbury Sampford, Mosterton *Netherbury, North Poorton *Pilsdon, Powerstock *Rampisham *South Perrott, Stoke Abbott *West Chelborough, Wraxall Somerset: *Misterton *Seaborough ===Blandford RSD=== *Almer, Anderson *Blandford Forum, Blandford St Mary, Bryanston (parts only) *Charlton Marshall *Durweston *Hilton *Iwerne Courtney, Iwerne Stepleton *Langton Long Blandford *Milborne St Andrew, Milborne Stileham, Milton Abbas *Pimperne *Spetisbury, Stourpaine *Tarrant Crawford, Tarrant Gunville, Tarrant Hinton, Tarrant Keyneston, Tarrant Launceston, Tarrant Monkton, Tarrant Rawston, Tarrant Rushton, Turnworth *Winterborne Clenston, Winterborne Houghton, Winterborne Kingston, Winterborne Stickland, Winterborne Tomson, Winterborne Whitchurch, Winterborne Zelston ===Blandford Forum USD=== *parts of Blandford Forum, Blandford St Mary and Bryanston ===Bridport RSD=== *Allington (part), Askerswell *parts of Bothenhampton, Bradpole and Burton Bradstock *Catherston Leweston, Chideock, Chilcombe *Litton Cheney, Loders *Puncknowle *Shipton Gorge, Stanton St Gabriel, Swyre, Symondsbury (part) *Walditch (part), Whitchurch Canonicorum, Wootton Fitzpaine ===Bridport USD=== *Bridport *parts of Allington, Bothenhampton, Bradpole, Burton Bradstock, Symondsbury and Walditch ===Cerne RSD=== *Alton Pancras *Batcombe, Buckland Newton *Cattistock, Cerne Abbas, Cheselbourne, West Compton *Frome St Quintin *Glanvilles Wootton, Godmanstone, Gorewood *Hermitage, Hilfield *Mappowder, Melbury Bubb, Melcombe Horsey, Minterne Magna *Nether Cerne *Piddletrenthide, Pulham *Sydling St Nicholas *Up Cerne ===Chard RSD=== In Somerset but also covered the following parish, at that time in Dorset: *Wambrook ===Dorchester RSD=== *Athelhampton *Bradford Peverell, Broadmayne, Burleston *Charminster, Chilfrome, Compton Valence *Dewlish, Dorchester (Holy Trinity) (part) *Fordington (part), Frampton, Frome Vauchurch *Kingston Russell *Littlebredy, Long Bredy *Maiden Newton *Piddlehinton, Puddletown *Stinsford, Stratton *Tincleton, Toller Fratrum, Toller Porcorum, Tolpuddle *Warmwell, Watercombe, West Knighton, West Stafford, Whitcombe, Winterborne Came, Winterborne Herringstone, Winterborne Monkton, Winterborne St Martin, Winterbourne Abbas, Winterbourne Steepleton, Woodsford, Wynford Eagle ===Dorchester USD=== *Dorchester (All Saints, St Peter;
