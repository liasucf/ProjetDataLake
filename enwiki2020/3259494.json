    "text": "John Francis Coffey (January 28, 1887 \u2013 February 14, 1966) was an infielder for the Boston Doves (1909), Detroit Tigers (1918) and Boston Red Sox (1918). Coffey graduated from Fordham University in 1910. While still in college, he was signed by the Doves and played 73 games; it was very common in those days for college players to play in the major leagues as well. He then spent most of the next 16 years in the minors, seeing his only other major-league action in 1918. He started that season playing 22 games with the Tigers before being sold to the Red Sox in mid-August. He was listed as a possible replacement for the injured Dave Shean, but never got a chance to play in the World Series. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Tigers and Red Sox). In two seasons, he played in 110 games and had 368 at bats with 33 runs, 69 hits, 5 doubles, 6 triples, 1 home run, 26 RBI, 6 stolen bases, 22 walks, a .188 batting average, .241 on-base percentage and a .242 slugging percentage. While still actively playing, he became the part-time coach at his alma mater, holding that post until 1918. He returned in 1922 as the school's first full-time coach and remained there until 1958 (Fordham didn't field a team in 1944), amassing 1160 wins. The University's baseball field is named in his honor. From 1926 to 1958, he also served as athletic director. He died in the Bronx, New York at the age of 79. ==See also== *List of college baseball coaches with 1,100 wins ==External links== *Baseball Almanac Category:1887 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Boston Doves players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Fordham Rams athletic directors Category:Fordham Rams baseball coaches Category:Fordham Rams baseball players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Denver Grizzlies (baseball) players Category:Denver Bears players Category:San Francisco Seals (baseball) players Category:Des Moines Boosters players Category:Hartford Senators players Category:Charleston Pals players Category:Macon Peaches players Category:Peoria Tractors players Category:Decatur Commodores players Category:Sportspeople from New York City ",
