    "text": "The Bezirksliga Schwaben-Nord is currently the seventh tier of the German football league system in the northern half of the Bavarian Regierungsbezirk of Swabia (German: Schwaben). Until the disbanding of the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben in 2012 it was the eighth tier. From 2008, when the 3. Liga was introduced, was the seventh tier of the league system, until the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 the sixth tier. From the leagues interception in 1968 to the introduction of the Bezirksoberliga in 1988 it was the fifth tier. == Overview == Before the Bezirksoberligas in Bavaria were introduced in 1988 the Bezirksligas were the leagues set right below the Landesligas Bayern in the football pyramid. From 1963 to 1968 the Bezirksliga Schwaben was played in one single division, in 1968 it was split in a northern and a southern division. For the purpose of administration, the two leagues are still seen as one and teams can be shifted between the two halves at the end of season. The winner of the Bezirksliga Schwaben-Nord, like the winner of the Bezirksliga Schwaben-S\u00fcd, is now directly promoted to the Landesliga Bayern-S\u00fcdwest. From 1968 to 1988, the league champions were promoted to the Landesliga Bayern-S\u00fcd, from 1988 to 2011 to the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben. In the later years of the league the runners-up were also given the opportunity to earn promotion by playing a promotion round with the runners-up of the southern division and the three Bezirksligas from Upper Bavaria. The bottom three teams of each group find themselves relegated to one of the six Kreisligas. At the same time the six Kreisliga winners are promoted to the Bezirksliga. The runners-up of those face a play-off with each other and the 13th placed teams in the Bezirksliga. The area covered by the Schwaben FA is not identical with the Bezirk Schwaben, there is a large number of clubs from Oberbayern playing in Schwaben, especially in the north. The Bezirksliga Schwaben-Nord is fed by the following Kreisligas. *Kreisliga Schwaben-Nord *Kreisliga Schwaben-West *Kreisliga Schwaben-Ost Without doubt the greatest player ever to play in the Bezirksliga Schwaben-Nord was the legendary Gerd M\u00fcller. In his last season before signing with FC Bayern Munich in 1963\u201364 he scored 51 goals in 31 matches for his hometown club TSV 1861 N\u00f6rdlingen and helped them win promotion! In 2008\u201309, the FC Schrobenhausen, league champion in 2006\u201307 and Schwaben Cup finalist in 2008, failed to win or draw any of their league games and scored only five goals in 30 games, while conceding 223.Bezirksliga Schwaben Nord 2008/09 Bayliga.de, accessed: 18 May 2009 With the league reform at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, which included an expansion of the number of Landesligas from three to five, the Bezirksoberligas were disbanded.
