Ostro\u017eac castle and Radetina Tower are located in Cazin. Cazin was the city of Knin Bishop.HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106, 1953, STARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES) https://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf #page=32 From 1929 to 1941, Cazin was part of the Vrbas Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Cazin uprising of 1950, an armed anti-state rebellion of peasants, occurred in Cazin and neighboring Velika Kladu\u0161a and Slunj, which were all part of Communist Yugoslavia at the time. The peasants revolted against the forced collectivization and collective farms by the Yugoslav government on the farmers of its country. Following a drought in 1949, the peasants of Yugoslavia were unable to meet unrealistic quotas set by their government and were punished. The revolt that followed the drought resulted in the killings and persecution of those who organized the uprising, but also many innocent civilians. It was the only peasant rebellion in the history of Cold War Europe. The city was successfully defended by the Bosnian Army during the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Settlements== Aside from the urban area of Cazin, the city administrative area comprises the following settlements: * Bajri\u0107i * Brezova Kosa * Bukovica * Crnaja * \u010caji\u0107i * \u010cizmi\u0107i * \u0106ehi\u0107i * \u0106orali\u0107i * Donja Barska * Donja Koprivna * Donja Lu\u010dka * Glogovac * Gornja Barska * Gornja Koprivna * Gornja Lu\u010dka * Gradina * Had\u017ein Potok * Kapi\u0107i * Kli\u010di\u0107i * Kova\u010devi\u0107i * Kraka\u010da * Krivaja * Li\u0111ani * Liskovac * Ljubijanki\u0107i * Majeti\u0107i * Miostrah * Mujaki\u0107i * Mutnik * Osredak * Ostro\u017eac * Ostro\u017eac na Uni * Pe\u0107igrad * Pivnice * Pjani\u0107i * Podgredina * Polje * Ponjevi\u0107i * Pro\u0161i\u0107i * Ro\u0161i\u0107i * Rujnica * Skokovi * Stijena * \u0160turli\u0107 * \u0160turli\u0107ka Platnica * Toromani * Tr\u017eac * Tr\u017ea\u010dka Platnica * Tr\u017ea\u010dka Ra\u0161tela * Urga * Vilenja\u010da * Vrelo * Zmajevac ==Demographics== According to the 2013 census, the city of Cazin has a population of 66,149 inhabitants. ===Ethnic groups=== The ethnic composition of the municipality: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
