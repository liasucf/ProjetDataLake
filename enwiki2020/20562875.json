The film is \"a hyper-real multi-angle DVD environment. Pan sonic, Mika Vainio and Ilpo V\u00e4is\u00e4nen, are immersed in the imagery of the cathode which seems to live and infect their physicality over the course of three parallel films as they merge with their own extreme sound and into Quist's sinister vision.\" \"A number of motion graphics were developed that would sync with the live documented sound and performance,\" \"From there, the idea evolved much further to include a kind of purely audio-visual narrative that included characters and suggests [the] inner life [that] goes on in a TV, as living energy. The various stages of the cathode process visually unfold.\"Earplug Magazine Locations for the documentary source footage include Philadelphia, PA, Boston, MA, New York City, Helsinki, Turku, and Tampere, Finland. Shooting commenced in 1999 and ended in 2003. With a long period of editing and motion graphic development in Quist's native Brooklyn, NY and Beaver County, Pennsylvania.

The only quote from the director was, \"Fear Television\" Stills from the film ==Critical response== \"Kuvaputki, by Edward Quist, belongs to a different genre again, so essential and hypnotic that it seems to go back to the origins of filmmaking: the bare, pure graphic representation of the steady beat of music.\"-The Milan Film Festival \"Edward Quist has managed to create a real jewel of \"counter- animation.\" The visual experimentation is extreme and magnificent, and hopefully this effort will become a point of reference over the next few months for other, similar publications.\" -Dagheisha \"This process is really impressive as anyone who watches the DVD will realize. The black and white film unites exceptionally with the sound world of the Finns capturing the spectator. While Kuvaputki is a high quality effort, it would not be an exaggeration for it to be characterized as a real work of art.\"Edjs-Edjs \"The initial idea of producing a documentary on Pan Sonic's live shows culminated in this abstract audiovisual tour de force.\"-Sonar Festival \"More than a meanly illustrated live show, here is one true multimedia proposition, like a digital update of \"In the Shadow of the Sun\" by Derek Jarman and with Throbbing Gristle.\"-Dside Sonar Electronic Festival described the film as \u201cA beautiful and unique film capturing the very essence of a Pansonic live performance\u2026. which really is quite an achievement\u201d SxSW Music Festival calls it \u201cAn embodiment. Probably the most perfect electronic music film yet\u201d ICA Film London \u201cSurprisingly watchable. Forty minutes of unswervingly modern, super intense sound & visuals\u201d ==Format== Format.
