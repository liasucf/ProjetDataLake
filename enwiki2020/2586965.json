    "text": "Lake of Two Mountains (French: Lac des Deux Montagnes) is part of the river delta widening of the Ottawa River in Quebec, Canada, at its confluence with the St. Lawrence River. Lake of Two Mountains has four outflows: Rivi\u00e8re des Mille \u00celes and Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies, bordering \u00cele J\u00e9sus, and two branches of the Ottawa River, flowing into the St. Lawrence via Lake Saint-Louis, on either side of \u00cele Perrot. The city of Deux-Montagnes is located on the lake's north shore, where it flows into Rivi\u00e8re des Mille \u00celes. The southwest portion of the city of Montreal borders the eastern part of the lake, as does the now merged village of Senneville. Kanesatake (Kanehsat\u00e0:ke), a Kanien'k\u00e9ha:ka Mohawk reserve in Kanesatake, Quebec, is also located along the northern shore. ==Origin of the name== The lake was named lac des M\u00e9dicis in 1612 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, then renamed lac des Soissons about 1632. By around 1684 French colonists named it as Lac des Deux Montagnes. The name refers to Calvaire Mountain and Saint-Joseph-du-Lac Hill, the two highest peaks of Mont Oka that face the lake on its northern shore. == See also == *List of crossings of the Ottawa River Category:Lakes of Laurentides Category:Lakes of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie Category:Landforms of Montreal ",
