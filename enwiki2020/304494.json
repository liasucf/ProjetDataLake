They appeared on the show managing to reach the \u00a31 million question, before answering it incorrectly and dropping from \u00a3500,000 down to \u00a332,000 (a loss of \u00a3468,000). For the first time ever, Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife retry the show after the company claimed that the last question \"didn't meet their standards\". After returning and being shown a different \u00a31 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing \u00a3468,000 for the second time and won \u00a3500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Children's Hospice, of which Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife are both patrons. Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom. They decided not to risk it this time and walked away with the \u00a3500,000. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? The allegedly misleading question was \"Translated from the Latin, what is the motto of the United States?\" The answer given was \"In God We Trust\" which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been \"Out of Many, One\" which is a translation of the Latin phrase E pluribus unum, which is found on the Great Seal, however it is not actually the current United States motto. E pluribus unum had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such. ==Work since 2007== Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen opening a charity shop in Stow-on-the-Wold in 2009 In 2007 he designed Decodance for Blackpool Illuminations, featuring six illuminated burlesque beauties.
