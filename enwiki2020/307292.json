    "text": "Ren\u00e9 Emile Goguen (born December 15, 1983) is a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e (). He currently works for Pro Wrestling Noah. Goguen is best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment, where he is a one-time World Tag Team Champion with Sylvain Grenier as the tag team La R\u00e9sistance and a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion with Kenzo Suzuki. He has also worked for Japanese promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling, Wrestle-1 and Hustle. He is the first wrestler in WWE to win a title as a teenager. Goguen is the son of Canadian Maritimes wrestling promoter Emile Dupr\u00e9e. ==Professional wrestling career== ===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment=== ====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2002\u20132003)==== In April 2002 Goguen signed with the World Wrestling Federation making him the youngest wrestler to sign with the WWF at the age of 18 on October 9, 2002 Goguen debuted under the ring name Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e after his father defeating Johnny Jeter. Dupr\u00e9e would team up with various wrestlers in dark matches on WWE Smackdown and WWE Raw, as well as compete in Ohio Valley Wrestling until April 2003. ====La R\u00e9sistance (2003\u20132004)==== After weeks of vignettes airing, Sylvain Grenier and Dupr\u00e9e made their first appearance on the April 28, 2003 episode of Raw as La R\u00e9sistance by attacking Scott Steiner. Steiner had made remarks two weeks earlier comparing France to hell and Grenier and Dupr\u00e9e were offended. La R\u00e9sistance went on to feud with Scott Steiner and Test, who was forced to be Steiner's tag team partner by Stacy Keibler. La R\u00e9sistance ended up defeating Steiner and Test at Judgment Day on May 18, 2003 in the team's pay-per-view debut. On June 15, 2003, La R\u00e9sistance won the World Tag Team Championship from Kane and Rob Van Dam at Bad Blood, making Dupr\u00e9e the youngest wrestler in WWE history to not only win the World Tag Team Championship, but any championship in the company's history at 19 years old. Also, as a result of winning the title, he was the first teenager in the history of the WWE that has won a championship. Dupr\u00e9e held on to this distinction until April 2018, when Nicholas won the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 34 at the age of 10. The third member of La R\u00e9sistance, Rob Conway, was originally introduced as an unnamed American serviceman being abused by Grenier and Dupr\u00e9e. When The Dudley Boyz came out to attack La R\u00e9sistance, they brought Conway into the ring with an American flag. Once the Dudley Boyz had their backs turned, Conway attacked them with the American flag and then tore it off the pole and laid it on top of them. Conway, now renamed to Rob\u00e9rt Conway, joined Dupr\u00e9e and Grenier and the trio began carrying the French flag to ringside and singing the French national anthem before their matches. La R\u00e9sistance dropped the titles to the Dudley Boyz at Unforgiven in a three-on-two handicapped tables match. The trio went on to feud with several tag teams, including the Dudley Boyz, Rosey and The Hurricane, and Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak. In October 2003, Grenier suffered a back injury. Dupr\u00e9e and Conway held the tag team together until Grenier returned in the Spring of 2004. At Armageddon, La R\u00e9sistance competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by Ric Flair and Batista. At the Royal Rumble, Dupr\u00e9e competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he eliminated Matt Hardy before getting eliminated by Rikishi. At Wrestlemania XX, La R\u00e9sistance (Dupr\u00e9e and Conway) competed in a Fatal four-way tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. Grenier returned in March 2004, thus reuniting the trio. The reunion did not last long, as Dupr\u00e9e was the first pick in the 2004 WWE Draft Lottery on March 22. ====Championship pursuits (2004\u20132005)==== 2004 Tribute to the Troops in Iraq Dupr\u00e9e made his SmackDown! debut on the March 25, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Billy Kidman. He briefly had a talk show on SmackDown!, called \"Cafe de Ren\u00e9\", but his only guest was Torrie Wilson as the segment was cancelled after only one night. Dupr\u00e9e wrestled Wilson to a draw on the April 27, 2004 edition of SmackDown. For several months, pursued the United States Championship, held by John Cena. After an incident that happened during his \"Cafe de Ren\u00e9\" (the same incident involving Torrie Wilson), Dupr\u00e9e challenged Cena to a championship match. The match was granted by the then-SmackDown! general manager Kurt Angle and it took place at Judgment Day. Cena retained the championship when he pinned Dupree after executing an F-U. At The Great American Bash, Dupr\u00e9e competed in a Four-way elimination match for the WWE United States Championship which saw Cena retain once again. After losing to Cena, he focused on the WWE Tag Team Championship and eventually won the title with Kenzo Suzuki on September 9 (making him the youngest man to win the WWE Tag Team Championship at age 20). At No Mercy, Dupr\u00e9e and Suzuki defeated Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio to retain the titles. They lost the championship on the December 9 episode of SmackDown! to Van Dam and Mysterio. This match happened just days before Van Dam and Mysterio were to challenge Dupr\u00e9e and Suzuki at Armageddon. At the pay-per-view, Dupr\u00e9e and Suzuki had a championship rematch, but they were unable to regain the tag title. At the 2005 Royal Rumble, Dupr\u00e9e competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Chris Jericho. On the February 20 edition of Sunday Night Heat before the No Way Out pay-per-view, Dupr\u00e9e and Suzuki faced Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas in a losing effort. On the March 24, 2005 airing of SmackDown!, he was \"sacrificed\" by The Undertaker as a message to Randy Orton (regarding their match at WrestleMania 21), when The Undertaker interrupted a match between Dupr\u00e9e and Booker T. The result of the \"sacrifice\" saw Dupr\u00e9e receiving a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel steps which lead up to the ring. Dupr\u00e9e was taken off television after this, working dark matches until the April 28 edition of SmackDown!, where he was defeated by John Cena. Dupr\u00e9e went back to dark matches and a few Velocity matches until the June 18 episode of Velocity, where Dupr\u00e9e came out calling himself \"The French Phenom\", defeating Mark Jindrak via submission. The following week on Velocity, Dupr\u00e9e came out with a new look, sporting black trunks with his initials as well as jet black hair and a Dal\u00ed-styled goatee. ====Brand switches and departure (2005\u20132007)==== ECW brand On June 30, Dupr\u00e9e became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, which saw him jump from SmackDown! back to Raw.
