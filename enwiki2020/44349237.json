    "text": "Territory claimed by the Castilian nationalism. United Castile or the Great Castile are political concepts used by the Castilian nationalists to define a geographic space considered to be the political territory of Castile and her jurisdiction. The Castilian nationalists aspire to unify and merge the Spanish autonomous regions of Cantabria, Castile-La Mancha, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Madrid and La Rioja into a single united territory called Castile. They consider all this territory to be their national motherland and also consider the current situation of political division to be unfair and erroneous. Castilian nationalism claims that Castile be declared Historic nationality within the political and regional framework of Spain and Madrid be the Capital city of the new unified territory. Within this proposal, there are two different political currents: * The regionalist current that claims that Castile be one region more within the regional framework of Spain. * The nationalist current that claims that Spain must convert into a confederation and let the Great Castile be a differentiated nation within a democratic and plural Spanish confederation. This political movement refers to this by speaking about the reconstruction of the motherland and lays claim to other territories which formed part of the historic Castile but they now belong to other Spanish regions. Some movements with ethnicist bias have recently appeared, however they remain insignificant and minority within the political regional outlook of Spain. Category:Castilian nationalism ",
