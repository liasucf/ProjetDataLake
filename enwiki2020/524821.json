    "text": "The bilabial clicks are a family of click consonants that sound something like a smack of the lips. They are found as phonemes only in the small Tuu language family (currently two languages, one moribund), in the \u01c2\u2019Amkoe language of Botswana (also moribund), and in the extinct Damin ritual jargon of Australia. However, bilabial clicks are found paralinguistically for a kiss in various languages, including integrated into a greeting in the Hadza language of Tanzania, and as allophones of labial\u2013velar stops in some West African languages (Ladefoged 1968), as of /mw/ in some of the languages neighboring Shona, such as Ndau and Tonga. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the place of articulation of these sounds is . This may be combined with a second letter to indicate the manner of articulation, though this is commonly omitted for tenuis clicks, and increasingly a diacritic is used instead. Common labial clicks are: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Trans. I !! Trans. II !! Trans. III !!

Damin also had an egressive bilabial , which may be an egressive click (if it is not buccal). ==Features== Features of ingressive labial clicks: *The forward place of articulation is labial, which means it is articulated with the lips. The release is a noisy, affricate-like sound. Bilabial articulation, using both lips, is typical. Sometimes this may pass through a labio-dental stage as the click is released, making it noisier.Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:251) In other cases, the lower lip may start out in contact with both the upper teeth and the upper lip.Miller, 2007, The Sounds of N\u01c0uu, pp 121ff (One of the two labial clicks in Damin is lingual egressive, which means that the trapped air pocket is compressed by the tongue until it is allowed to spurt out through the lips.) The labial clicks are sometimes erroneously described as sounding like a kiss. However, they do not have the pursed lips of a kiss. Instead, the lips are compressed, more like a than a , and they sound more like a noisy smack of the lips than a kiss. ==Symbol== The bullseye' or bull's eye (') symbol used in phonetic transcription of the phoneme was made an official part of the International Phonetic Alphabet in 1979, but had existed for at least 50 years earlier. It is encoded in Unicode as U+0298 LATIN LETTER BILABIAL CLICK. Similar graphemes consisting of a circled dot encoded by Unicode are: *Gothic \ud800\udf48 \u0195air *astronomical symbol \u2609 \"Sun\" *mathematical operators \u2299 \"circled dot operator\" and \u2a00 and \"n-ary circled dot operator\" *geometrical symbol \u25c9 \"fisheye\" *Cyrillic \ua668, \ua669 (monocular O) It was never widely used and was eventually dropped for . Still the deprecated IPA character is encoded at . Earlier it is privately encoded by SIL International at and is available in SIL supporting fonts. ==Occurrence== English does not have a labial click (or any click consonant, for that matter) as a phoneme, but a plain bilabial click does occur in mimesis, as a lip-smacking sound children use to imitate a fish. Labial clicks only occur in the Tuu and Kx'a families of southern Africa, and in the Australian ritual language Damin. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Language !! Word !! IPA !!

Starostin (2003)George Starostin (2003) A lexicostatistical approach towards reconstructing Proto-Khoisan, page 22. Mother Tongue, vol. VIII. notes that the \u01c2\u2019Amkoe words for 'one' and 'two', and , have labial clicks whereas no other Khoisan language has a labial consonant of any kind in its words for these numerals, and Starostin (2007)George Starostin (2007) '\u041b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0441\u044b \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0445' ('On labial clicks') and Sands reconstruct a series of labialized clicks in Proto-Kx\u02bca, which became labial clicks in \u01c2\u2019Amkoe.
