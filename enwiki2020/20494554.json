They were generally set up in cities with some sort of German commercial interest. In early use only the cancellation mark can identify their postal use abroad; such stamps are known as \"Vorl\u00e4ufer\" (forerunner) stamps.German Colonies Collectors Group Later stamps are identified by overprints even when not postally used. German abroad stamps started appearing in the late 19th century and reached their heyday at the beginning of the 20th century; they closed down during or shortly after World War I.

Stamps from German post offices abroad are popular with collectors and some are quite valuable. In a 2006 auction, a 40 Pfennig Germania hand-stamped \"China\" (Tientsin issue) stamp from 1900 realized 100,152 Euros.http://www.briefmarkenauktion.de/englisch/s_aktuell_e.htm ==German post offices in Morocco== Morocco, 1900 Morocco, 1905 German post offices in Morocco (German: Deutsche Post in Marokko) started to operate in 1899.
