While walking to the compound, the group is attacked by the dead and Madison is knocked to the ground while Chris stands by watching, which Alicia sees, before killing Madison's attacker. The group arrives at the compound, and are greeted by Luis' mother Celia who tells them they can stay but must leave their weapons outside. Strand finds that Thomas has been bitten and is dying. Alicia tells Chris what she saw regarding Madison's attack. Nick and Celia form a bond and she talks to him about her view of the dead and says it is just a new beginning, not the end. Madison, now aware of what Chris did, tells Travis she thinks he isn't well. They argue about her inability to want to help Chris, when Travis was always willing to help Nick. Daniel discovers that Celia is keeping the compound's dead family members in the cellar. Madison decides to sleep with Alicia that night to provide comfort and they are woken by a gunshot to find Chris standing over them, holding a knife and they chase him from the room. Strand shoots Thomas in the head. == Reception == \"Sicut Cervus\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it garnered an 85% rating, with an average score of 6.48/10 based on 13 reviews. The site consensus reads, \"\"Sicut Cervus\" offers up plenty of action, drama, and mystery, but it's the focus on family dynamics -- and a change of setting -- that bring out the best in the episode.\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fear_the_walking_dead/s02/e06 Matt Fowler of IGN gave \"Sicut Cervus\" a 7.4/10.0 rating stating; \"\"Sicut Cervus\" took us to a new, fresh location full of possibilities. And while the show began to more definitively take a harsh stance on Chris' angry, cowardly acts, even pushing him further down that road, it was hindered by a new character who was too reminiscent of a Season 2 plot over on The Walking Dead.\" ===Ratings=== \"Sicut Cervus\" was seen by 4.49 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, slightly above the previous episodes rating of 4.41 million. ==References== Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Fear the Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ",
