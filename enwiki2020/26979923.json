In a review of Belouis Some, Scott Benarde of The Palm Beach Post described the song as \"dreamy\". Norman Corbett of Aberdeen Press and Journal gave the single three out of four stars and commented: \"Laid-back cut not sharp enough to pierce big time success. Pleasing enough sound from Some flows along but lacks bite. Profligate use of vocal talent.\" ==Track listing== ;UK 12\" :A. \"Animal Magic\" (Extended Version) :B1. \"Animal Magic\" (Radio Version) :B2. \"Aware of You\" ;U.S. 12\" :A1. \"Animal Magic\" (Dance Vocal) (Remix, additional production: Justin Strauss & Murray Elias) \\- 6:58 :A2. \"Animal Magic\" (Jungle Mix) (Remix, additional production: Justin Strauss & Murray Elias) \\- 7:10 :B1. \"Animal Magic\" (Dub) (Remix, additional production: Justin Strauss & Murray Elias) \\- 6:10 :B2. \"Aware of You\" (Producer: Steve Thompson & Michael Barbiero) \\- 3:42 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1987) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|42 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |} ==References== Category:1987 singles Category:Belouis Some songs Category:1987 songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:Song recordings produced by Gary Langan Category:Songs written by Belouis Some ",
