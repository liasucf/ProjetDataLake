    "text": "Reginald Stuart Poole (27 January 18328 February 1895), known as Stuart Poole, was an English archaeologist, numismatist and Orientalist. Poole was from a famous Orientalist family as his mother Sophia Lane Poole, brother Stanley Lane-Poole, and uncle Edward William Lane were famous for their work in this field. His other uncle was Richard James Lane, a distinguished Victorian lithographer and engraver. ==Life== Born in London, Poole was the son of the Rev. Edward Poole, a well-known bibliophile. His parents became estranged during his early childhood, and his mother, Sophia Lane Poole, took her sons to Egypt to live with her brother, the Orientalist Edward William Lane. During their seven-year residence in Cairo from 1842 to 1849, Lane Poole wrote The Englishwoman in Egypt, while her son was imbibing an early taste for Egyptian antiquities. In 1852 he became an assistant in the British Museum and was assigned to the Department of Coins and Medals, of which in 1870 he became keeper. In that capacity he worked as a writer, teacher, and administrator. He was largely responsible for founding the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1882 and for starting the Society of English Medallists in 1884.P. Attwood, 'The Society of the Medallists: a nineteenth-century forerunner of the British Art Medal Society', The Medal, 4 (1983), 4\u201311 He was Yates Professor of Archaeology at University College, London and also lecturer at the Royal Academy. In 1883 he received an honorary degree from Cambridge University. He received the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1892.\"Medallists of the Royal Numismatic Society\". The Royal Numismatic Society. Retrieved 7 June 2016. On 6 August 1861 he had married Eliza Christina Forlonge, daughter of William Forlonge, with whom he had four children, including Sir Reginald Ward Poole. Poole retired in 1893 and died in 1895. ==Works== Some of Poole's best work was done in his articles for the 9th edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, on Egypt, Hieroglyphics and Numismatics; he also wrote for Smith's Dictionary of the Bible and published volumes dealing with his special subjects. Poole was one of the strong defenders in England of the work of Champollion when he was criticized harshly by Sir George Lewis even as late as 1862. In reply to Lewis critique, Poole defended Champollion's method describing it as \"the method of interpreting Hieroglyphics originated by Dr. Young and developed by Champollion\". ==Selected publications== [NC = Numismatic Chronicle] *1860 Cairo, Sinai, Jerusalem, and The Pyramids of Egypt: A Series of Sixty Photographic Viewsby Francis Frith, Sophie Lane Poole and Reginald Stuart Poole. *1860 The Genesis of the Earth and of Man: a critical examination of passages in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, chiefly with a view to the solution of the question, Whether the varieties of the Human Species be of more than one origin *1861 On a coin of Mallus in Cilicia [read 26 Jan 1859], NC, New Series, vol. 1 (1861), part 2, pp. 87\u201390, text fig. *1861 On a copper coin of the class struck after the death of Alexander the Great, by his generals, before they assumed regal titles [read 25 April 1861], NC, New Series, vol. 1 (1861), part 3, pp.; 137\u20130139, text fig. *1861 On two Cretan coins in the British Museum [read 22 March 1860], NC, New Series, vol. 1 (1861), part 3, pp. 168\u201374, pl. *1861 On a coin from the Cyrenaica, presented to the British Museum by the late F.H.
