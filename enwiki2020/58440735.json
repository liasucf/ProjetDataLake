The Center claims to challenge conventional wisdom where appropriate, add texture to the current deliberations on policy issues and build support for positions that further the national interest and the interest of key allies.https://londoncenter.org/about/about-london-center/ The London Center has been influential in the staffing and policy direction of the Trump Administration with many of its Senior Fellows taking on both officials and unofficial roles in the administration.https://www.thedailybeast.com/the- creepily-influential-trumpist-foreign-policy-think-tank-youve-never-heard-of ==Fellows== * Deroy Murdock * Gordon G.
