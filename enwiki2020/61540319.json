Loba), (Spanish for \"wolf\") is a racial category in the Spanish colonial racial label for a mixed- race casta, far down the racial hierarchy created by the Spanish colonial regime privileging European whites. ==Definitions== Lobo and coyote are derogatory names for persons of mixed race, referred to by animal names. It could include persons of African and Indian ancestry, and many related variations. Lobo does not have a fixed meaning, with possible parents being a Black and Indian woman; Cambujo (African/Amerindian) and Indian woman; Torna atr\u00e1s and Indian woman; Mestizo and Indian woman; Salta atr\u00e1s (of African/European ancestry) and Mulatto woman.Garc\u00eda Saiz, Maria Conception. Las Castas Mexicanas: Un G\u00e9nero Pict\u00f3rico Americano. Milan: Olivetti 1989, pp. 28-29. Lobo was a classification used in official colonial documentation, including the Inquisition trials, marriage registers, and censuses.Katzew, Ilona. Casta Painting. New Haven: Yale University Press 2004, p. 44. One example of a Loba is a mixed-race woman who came before the Mexican Inquisition; she had been given multiple racial labels. She was publicly known as a China, was known to be a parda (a brown-skinned person) who \u201clooked like a loba\u201d, suggesting she had visible African features.quoted in Vinson, Ben III. Before Mestizaje: The Frontiers of Race and Caste in Colonial Mexico. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 64-65 Lobos were known to be enslaved persons in seventeenth-century Mexico, likely with the mother being a Negra. The status of a child as slave or free followed that of the mother; thus children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their paternity.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 70. In historian Ben Vinson III\u2019s analysis of what he calls \u201cextreme racial categories,\u201d he includes lobos with castizos, moriscos, albinos (persons with mixed African ancestry who look European), coyotes, \"mestindios\", and chinos.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 92. There were regional differences in colonial Mexico for racial labeling. For instance, in Xich\u00fa and Casas Viejas in the Baj\u00edo region near Quer\u00e9taro and the Sierra Gorda mountains, where there were resident indigenous populations, as well as blacks and mulattos, locally the people used lobos as a \"normative category\".Vinson, Before Mestizaje, pp. 98-99. In his examination of marriage patterns from marital registers, Vinson found no records of lobos marrying each other; brides and grooms thus classified chose partners from other racial categories.Vinson, Before Mestizaje, p. 128 In eighteenth-century casta paintings, lobos are usually shown doing physical work and not lavishly dressed, indicating lower class status. In Joaqu\u00edn Antonio de Basar\u00e1s\u2019s Origen, costumbres, y estado presente de mexicanos y philipinos (1763), the lobo father is a water carrier, while his Indian wife sells chickens.Katzew, Casta Painting, pp. 186-87, illustration 248. An early 18th-century set of casta paintings shows the Lobo as the offspring of a Black father and India mother; in the same set, a Lobo father and an India mother have a dark-skinned child labeled a Lobo Torna atr\u00e1s, meaning the child more closely resembled the Black father.Garc\u00eda Saiz, \u2018\u2019Las Castas Mexicanas\u2019\u2019, pp. 58, 59.
