It lies in the dip between the southern end of the Viminal and the western end of the Esquiline hills. Most of its inhabitants lived in insulae, tall apartment buildings with tabernae on the ground floor. Julius Caesar lived in a family home (domus) in the Suburra district until he was elected pontifex maximus at the age of 37, as the Suburra had grown up around the property many years before his birth. The district is featured in Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome, Steven Saylor's Roman Blood, Martha Marks' Rubies of the Viper, SPQR series by John Maddox Roberts, and Netflix's first original motion picture in Italy, Suburra, and its prequel Suburra: Blood on Rome. ==References== ==External links== *Subura (article in Platner's Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome) *Location of Caesars house in Subura (Historian Peter Oersteds speculation: The location of Caesars house in the Subura) Category:Topography of the ancient city of Rome ",
