Five months prior, Lastovic had quit his day job to do a play for $25 a week. \"I had money saved up from the one commercial that I had done and thought I could use the money from that to do the play.\" However, the play lasted longer than expected and Lastovic ran out of money. \"I was so broke that I looked forward to the dinner scene\" so he could eat. Fortunately, Lastovic booked Days as the play ended. Lastovic had actually auditioned for the series three years prior.

After he booked the role, Lastovic admitted that he got hooked on the show when he went back to watch Patch and Kayla's love story. ===Teen years (2015\u20132017)=== The production team wanted to establish a teenage set in time for the show's 50th anniversary and Lastovic's casting was just the first in a slew of castings. Executive producer Ken Corday said \"Joey will be giving Patch the 'rebel' a little of his own medicine!\" Lastovic was very nervous about playing such an important role but Mary Beth Evans invited him over to her home and greeted him with freshly baked cookies. \"Seeing Mary Beth holding that plate of cookies, I immediately felt that motherly connection.\" He credited Evans and Stephen Nichols for making him comfortable. Lastovic also founded a mentor in costar Casey Moss who had joined the series two years prior in the similar role of troubled teenager JJ Deveraux\u2014Joey's cousin. \"I think he could see a little bit of himself in me\" Lastovic said. Lastovic later admitted that his nerves worked well for his first scenes as Joey had recently run away from boarding school -- \"he was supposed to be nervous.\" So much is changing Joey at the time of his return. \"He's just beginning to experience all these new emotions, so he's feeling a little lost.\" Joey's needing his parents helps bring Patch and Kayla back together after years of estrangement.
