    "text": "In telecommunications, reflection loss occurs on a line which results in part of the energy being reflected back to the source. This can occur: #At a discontinuity or impedance mismatch, e.g., in a transmission line, the ratio of the incident power to the reflected power. Reflection loss is usually expressed in dB. #In an optical fiber, the loss that takes place at any discontinuity of refractive index, especially at an air-glass interface such as a fiber endface, at which a fraction of the optical signal is reflected back toward the source. This reflection phenomenon is also called \"Fresnel reflection loss,\" or simply \"Fresnel loss.\" ==See also== *Federal Standard 1037C *MIL-STD-188 ==References== * Reflection loss on Answers Category:Telecommunication theory ",
