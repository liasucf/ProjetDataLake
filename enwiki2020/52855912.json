    "text": "Sodium calcium edetate (sodium calcium EDTA), also known as edetate calcium disodium among other names, is a medication primarily used to treat lead poisoning, including both short-term and long-term lead poisoning. Sodium calcium edetate came into medical use in the United States in 1953. ==Chelation agent== Sodium calcium edetate is in the chelating agent family of medication. It is a salt of edetate with two sodium and one calcium atoms. It works by binding to a number of heavy metals, which renders them almost inert and allows them to leave the body in the urine. Edetate disodium is a different formulation which does not have the same effects. ===Medical use=== Sodium calcium edetate's primarily use is to treat lead poisoning, for which it is an alternative to succimer. It is given by slow injection into a vein or into a muscle. For lead encephalopathy sodium calcium edetate is typically used together with dimercaprol. It may also be used to treat plutonium poisoning. It does not appear to be useful for poisoning by tetra-ethyl lead. === Side effects === Common side effects include pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include kidney problems, diarrhea, fever, muscle pains, and low blood pressure. Benefits when needed in pregnancy are likely greater than the risks. == History == Sodium calcium edetate came into medical use in the United States in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2015 in the United States, a course of treatment costs US$50 to US$100. == References == == External links == * Category:Calcium compounds Category:Chelating agents used as drugs Category:Organic sodium salts Category:World Health Organization essential medicines ",
