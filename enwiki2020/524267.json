    "text": "Mero\u00eb (; also spelled Meroe; Meroitic or ; and ; ) was an ancient city on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km north-east of the Kabushiya station near Shendi, Sudan, approximately 200 km north-east of Khartoum. Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah (). This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC, until its collapse in the fourth century CE. The Kushitic Kingdom of Mero\u00eb gave its name to the \"Island of Mero\u00eb\", which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah and the Blue Nile. The city of Mero\u00eb was on the edge of Butana. There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana: Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. The first of these sites was given the name Mero\u00eb by the Persian king, Cambyses, in honor of his sister who was called by that name. The city had originally borne the ancient appellation Saba, named after the country's original founder. The eponym Saba, or Seba, is named for one of the sons of Cush (see Genesis 10:7). The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production. The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Mero\u00eb represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It is one of the earliest and most impressive states found south of the Sahara. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, one's understanding of Mero\u00eb in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states. The site of the city of Mero\u00eb is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups, of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids. == History == Near East in 200 BCE, showing the Kingdom of Meroe and its neighbours. Mero\u00eb was the southern capital of the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush spanned the period c. 800 BCE \u2013 c. 350 CE but, initially, its main capital was farther north at Napata. King Aspelta moved the capital to Mero\u00eb, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly c. 591 BCE, just after the sack of Napata by Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II. Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero\u00eb, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Mero\u00eb was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people. According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, the name of the city was Medewi or Bedewi. ===First Meroitic Period (542\u2013315 BC)=== The Kings ruled over Napata and Mero\u00eb. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Meroe. The Main temple of Amun is located in Napata, but the temple at Meroe is under construction. Kings and many queens are buried in Nuri, some queens are buried in Meroe, in the West Cemetery.Dows Dunham, Notes on the History of Kush 850 B. C.-A. D. 350, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 50, No. 3 (July \u2013 September , 1946), pp. 378\u2013388 The earliest king is Analmaye (542\u2013538 BCE), the latest king of the first phase is Nastasen (335\u2013315 BCE) In the fifth century BCE, Greek historian Herodotus described it as \"a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians.\" Excavations revealed evidence of important, high ranking Kushite burials, from the Napatan Period (c. 800 \u2013 c. 280 BCE) in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western cemetery. The importance of the town gradually increased from the beginning of the Meroitic Period, especially from the reign of Arakamani (c. 280 BCE) when the royal burial ground was transferred to Mero\u00eb from Napata (Gebel Barkal). Royal burials formed the Pyramids of Mero\u00eb, containing the burials of the Kings and Queens of Mero\u00eb from ca 300 BC to about 350 AD.George A.

The first King of the period is Aktisanes (Early 3rd century BC), the last king of the period is Sabrakamani (first half 3rd century BC). ===Third Meroitic Period (270 BC-1st century AD)=== The seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroe. Kings are buried in Meroe, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. Napata's only importance is the Amun Temple. Meroe flourishes and many building projects are undertaken. The first king of the period is Arakamani (270\u2013260 BCE), the last ruler is Queen Amanitore (mid/late 1st century CE) Many beautiful artifacts were found in Meroean tombs from around this time.

In 23 BCE the Roman governor of Egypt, Publius Petronius, to end the Meroitic raids, invaded Nubia in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, pillaging the north of the region and sacking Napata (22 BCE) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues (among other things) from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed many of the statues intact, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BCE between Rome and Mero\u00eb under Augustus and Amanirenas, respectively. One looted head though, from a statue of the emperor Augustus, was buried under the steps of a temple. It is now kept in the British Museum. Kandake Amanitore, circa 50 CE The next recorded contact between Rome and Mero\u00eb was in the autumn of 61 CE. The Emperor Nero sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country, who reached the city of Mero\u00eb where they were given an escort, then proceeded up the White Nile until they encountered the swamps of the Sudd. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa. The period following Petronius' punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Mero\u00eb. L. P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country. However, the kingdom of Mero\u00eb began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century CE, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries. Mero\u00eb is mentioned succinctly in the 1st century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: ===Fourth Meroitic Period (1st century-4th century AD)=== Necklace from Mero\u00eb. 50\u2013320 CE. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. This is the twilight of the Meroitic Culture. Kings are buried in Meroe, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. In 350 CE Meroe is destroyed by Axum. The first king of the fourth period was Shorkaror (1st century CE), while the last rulers may be King Yesebokheamani or Queen Lakhideamani in the 4th century AD. A stele of Ge'ez of an unnamed ruler of Aksum thought of as Ezana was found at the site of Mero\u00eb; from his description, in Greek, that he was \"King of the Aksumites and the Omerites,\" (i.e. of Aksum and Himyar) it is likely this king ruled sometime around 330. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Axumites destroyed the kingdom of Meroe, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroe around 300. Moreover, some view the stele as military aid from Aksum to Meroe to quell down the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof to which view is correct is not currently present. == Mero\u00eb in Hebrew legend == Hebrew oral tradition avers that Moses, in his younger years, had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan (Kush), as far as the city of Mero\u00eb, which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall, and governed by a renegade king. To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country, Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge, each containing an ibis, only to be released when they approached the enemy's country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country. Having successfully laid siege to the city, the city was eventually subdued by the betrayal of the king's daughter, who had agreed to deliver the city to Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her, under the solemn assurance of an oath. == Civilization == Meroitic script Mero\u00eb was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong iron industry, as well as international trade involving India and China. Metalworking is believed to have gone on in Mero\u00eb, possibly through bloomeries and blast furnaces, and Archibald Sayce reportedly referred to it as \"the Birmingham of Africa\", because of perceived vast production and trade of iron (a contention that is a matter of debate in modern scholarship). The centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannah-oriented forms of subsistence. At the time, iron was one of the most important metals worldwide, and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Mero\u00eb also exported textiles and jewelry. Their textiles were based on cotton and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BCE. Furthermore, Nubia was very rich in gold. It is possible that the Egyptian word for gold, nub, was the source of name of Nubia. Trade in \"exotic\" animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy. Apart from the iron trade, pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Meroe kingdom. The production of fine and elaborated decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory. The sakia, was used to move water, in conjunction with irrigation, to increase crop production. At its peak, the rulers of Mero\u00eb controlled the Nile Valley north to south, over a straight-line distance of more than . The King of Mero\u00eb was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother, or Candace. However, the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of treasurers, seal bearers, heads of archives and chief scribes, among others. Although the people of Mero\u00eb also had southern deities such as Apedemak, the lion-son of Sekhmet (or Bast, depending upon the region), they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were Amun, Tefnut, Horus, Isis, Thoth and Satis, though to a lesser extent. The collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered as one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. == Language == Stamp or thumb ring in the form of three cartouches (enclosing dot pattern). Each topped with two plumes and sun disc. Faience. From Meroe. Meroitic period. Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology The Meroitic language was spoken in Mero\u00eb and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BCE). It became extinct about 400 CE. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180\u2013170 BCE. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies. By the 3rd century BCE, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs, used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Mero\u00eb/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700 \u2013 300 BCE), and first appears in the 2nd century BCE. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms. It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she proposes, are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Claude Rilly, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, proposes that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, instead belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. == Archaeology == Plan of the North pyramid field at Mero\u00eb. The site of Mero\u00eb was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cailliaud (1787\u20131869), who published an illustrated in-folio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription. As Margoliouth notes in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, small scale excavations occurred in 1834, led by Giuseppe Ferlini, who, as Margoliouth states, \"discovered (or professed to discover) various antiquities, chiefly in the form of jewelry, now in the museums of Berlin and Munich.\" Margoliouth continues, File:Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe-114985.jpg|Column and elephant - part of temple complex in Musawwarat es-Sufra File:Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe-114987.jpg|Roman Kiosk and Apedemak Temple in Naqa File:Archaeological Sites of the Island of Meroe-114991.jpg|Colonnade of rams in front of Amun-Ra temple in Naqa == World Heritage listing == A modern satellite view of the region of Meroe (October 2020) In June 2011, the Archeological Sites of Mero\u00eb were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. == See also == *Sedeinga pyramids *List of modern names for biblical place names *Kandake == References == ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Further reading=== * * * == External links == * * LearningSites.com \u2013 Gebel Barkal * UNESCO World Heritage \u2013 Gebel Barkal and the Sites of the Napatan Region * Nubia Museum \u2013 Merotic Empire * Voyage au pays des pharaons noirs Travel in Sudan and notes on Nubian history * Labelled map of the pyramids at Meroe * Sudan's forgotten pyramids \u2013 BBC News * Pictures of Mero\u00eb \u2013 An online slide show as part of a detailed travelogue (in German) Category:African civilizations Category:Ancient cities Category:Archaeological sites in Sudan Category:Former populated places in Sudan Category:History of Nubia Category:Kingdom of Kush Category:Roman frontiers Category:World Heritage Sites in Sudan Category:Ancient Greek geography-East Africa ",
