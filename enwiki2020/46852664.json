    "text": "The 70r Red Army Soldier error or RSFSR 70r error of 1922 is one of the rarest postage stamps issued by the Soviet Russia. Due to the double printing error, one clich\u00e9 of the imperforate 25-stamp sheet has a 70-ruble value instead of the correct 100-ruble. Only four intact complete sheets are known. == Description == The sheets contain 25 imperforate 100-ruble orange stamps depicting the Red Army soldier that appeared in the RSFSR 1922 Workers and Soldiers definitive issue. The twelfth stamp in the sheet has the denomination of 70 rubles, unlike all the others that have the face value of 100 rubles. == Rarity == Only four complete sheets of 25 exist, including one in the state collection of the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As promoted by the Museum, \"the celebrated Red Army Soldier of the 1922\u201323 standard issue is a well known world class rarity.\" These standout items are dubbed as \"one of the greatest rarities in Russian philately\". They represent \"one of the treasures of Russian philately in general and certainly an important highlight of Russian Soviet Federative Republic collection.\" On 20 February 2014, Cherrystone Auctions in New York City offered one complete Red Army Soldier sheet, among the items of the Igor Gorski specialised collection of Russia that contained many errors and unique varieties of the RSFSR period. It was sold for $126,500. == See also == * Definitive stamps of Russia * Definitive stamps of the Soviet Union * Errors, freaks, and oddities * First USSR stamps * Gold Standard issue * List of postage stamps * Postage stamps and postal history of Russia * Soviet and post-Soviet postage rates * Soviet Union stamp catalogue == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Category:Postage stamps Category:Postage stamps of the Soviet Union Category:1922 introductions ",
