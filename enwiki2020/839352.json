Toward the end of Erickson's career at RedState he began to increase his focus on his radio show, which was owned by Cox Media Group. He eventually quit the site to work on it full-time. ===The Resurgent=== In January 2016, Erickson launched the conservative website The Resurgent. ==Political views and controversies== The Daily Telegraph of London put Erickson on its \"List of Most Influential US Conservatives\", giving him a rank of 69th most influential in 2007 and 65th in 2010.Hamden, Toby, \"The most influential US conservatives: 80-61\", January 11, 2010, The Telegraph, retrieved May 30, 2010 According to the 2007 newspaper article: \"Erickson epitomises the new power of the internet. A small-government fiscal and social conservative based in the South, he taps into and influences the Republican 'base' that the GOP\u2019s 2008 candidates are courting.\"Hamden, Toby, \"The most influential US conservatives 2007: 61-80\", October 30, 2007, The Telegraph, retrieved May 30, 2010 According to The Atlantic, Erickson's conservatism is more traditional (as opposed to libertarian) and \"deeply informed by his evangelical faith\". Erickson emphasizes small government, strong national defense, and the primacy of the traditional family. ===Donald Trump=== During a CNN interview after a Republican Party debate hosted by Fox News on August 6, 2015, Donald Trump had said that Fox News anchor and debate co-moderator Megyn Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever\u201d while questioning him during the debate. The next day, Erickson disinvited Trump from a RedState gathering held in Atlanta, calling Trump's remark \"a bridge too far\u201d and that even \"blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross\" certain lines, including decency. The following day, Trump released a statement stating that Erickson had a history of making controversial statements for which he has had to apologize, and that he, Trump, was an outsider who did not fit into Erickson's agenda. Erickson described Trump as \"a racist\" and \"a fascist\", and insisted, \"I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever.\" In February 2019, Erickson endorsed Trump for re- election in the 2020 presidential election. === Gender === In 2013, Erickson was criticized for saying in an interview on Fox Business Network that males dominate females in the \"natural world\" and it was only \"science\" for men to be the breadwinners for their family. === Guns === In December 2015, Erickson posted a picture of a bullet ridden copy of The New York Times that he had shot at. That day's edition contained a front-page editorial in favor of gun control. Erickson spread a false story by RedState which claimed that 17-year old Parkland, Florida school shooting survivor David Hogg was not actually at the Parkland school when it was attacked. He later described Hogg as a \"bully\" after Hogg called for an advertiser boycott of right-wing Fox News host Laura Ingraham when she mocked him for not getting into a number of universities. === LGBT rights === In 2017, Erickson signed a manifesto, the Nashville Statement, which condemned homosexuality and transgender identity, saying that homosexual and transgender identity was not according to God's plan. === Attacks on public figures === In April 2009, Erickson described retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter on his Twitter account as \"the only goat fucking child molester to ever serve on the Supreme Court\u201d. In an appearance on The Colbert Report, Erickson said the statement was \"not my finest hour.\" Erickson called Texas state senator Wendy Davis \"Abortion Barbie\". In a blog post, Erickson considered whether President Obama was \u201cshagging hookers\u201d and wondered whether Michelle Obama (whom he called a \u201cMarxist harpy\u201d) \u201cwould go Lorena Bobbit [sic] on him should he even think about it.\u201d Erickson argued that President Obama won the Nobel Prize because of an \u201caffirmative action quota.\u201d Erickson compared the Obama administration's health care communications director Linda Douglass to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. === Augusto Pinochet === In November 2018, Erickson tweeted that foreign aid to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico would be more effectively spent installing \"Pinochet types\" in these countries. He added that the US should \"support strong leaders who support free market reforms and promote economic stability, even if with a heavy hand\". When challenged on this proposal, Erickson replied \"I'm hoping for some helicopters in this plan\", a reference to Death flights in Chile during Pinochet's regime. Kathryn Sikkink, a professor in International Relations at the Harvard Kennedy School, responded to Erickson's remarks. She noted that \"Pinochet was a Chilean dictator who committed massive human rights abuses,\" and that Erickson got the \"facts exactly backward. Recent history and social science don\u2019t show that authoritarian regimes stop people from fleeing across borders. They show that they make more people want to flee.\" ==Book== In 2017 he published a book Before You Wake: Life Lessons from a Father to His Children. ==References== ==External links== * * \"Confessions of a Political Junkie\" blog * \"Peach Pundit\" blog Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Jackson, Louisiana Category:American bloggers Category:American evangelicals Category:American political writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:American radio personalities Category:Journalists from Louisiana Category:CNN people Category:Georgia (U.S. state) city council members Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans Category:College Republicans Category:American political commentators Category:Mercer University alumni Category:Presbyterians from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Tea Party movement activists Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American male bloggers ",
