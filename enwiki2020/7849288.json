NSW local government minister Shelley Hancock accepted the recommendations of the report created by commissioner Roslyn McCulloch. Local Government Minister Shelley Hancock accepted the recommendation from the independent commissioner of the public inquiry to dismiss the council's mayor and councillors and appoint an administrator to address financial and structural issues. The report, which has been tabled in Parliament, found: \u2022 The council has failed to command the confidence of its community \u2022 Councillors have failed to appreciate the need for sound and consistent financial principles, with division among councillors affecting decision making; \u2022 An absence of understanding by councillors of the importance of transparency in decision making, including inappropriate closure of council meetings; \u2022 The council has failed to act as a responsible employer, particularly regarding the interaction between councillors and council staff, resulting in the loss of valuable personnel; and \u2022 The council has failed to comply with its obligations as Reserve Trust Manager under the Crown Lands Act in relation to Balranald Caravan Park. \u201cI have not taken the decision to dismiss the council lightly,\u201d Mrs Hancock said. \u201cThe ratepayers of Balranald Shire deserve a strong council that is representing the best interests of the community. \u201cI have accepted the recommendation by Commissioner Roslyn McCulloch to dismiss the elected representatives and appoint an administrator to perform the role of the mayor and councillors until 2024. \u201cThis course of action will provide the best possible way to strengthen the operation, performance and sustainability of the council and ensure it is serving the best interests of the local community.\u201d Mike Colreavy has been appointed administrator of Balranald Shire Council. Mr Colreavy has 37 years\u2019 experience in the local government sector at metropolitan, regional and rural councils including holding various general manager positions. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Local government areas of the Riverina ",
