El fac\u00f3n es hermano leg\u00edtimo de la navaja sevillana.\", particularly in the nations of Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina as a convenient weapon of self-defense. The fac\u00f3n was later universally adopted by the gaucho and by men of the rural working class in Argentina and Uruguay, and was used in countless lethal knife fights and murders.Slatta, Richard W., Gauchos and the Vanishing Frontier, University of Nebraska Press, , (1992), p. 74 In an 1828 account of the capture of Las Damas Argentinas, a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish-speaking pirates, the carrying of knives very similar to the fac\u00f3n is mentioned: \"Amongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives - weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously. They are about the size of a common English carving knife, but for several inches up the blade cut both sides.\"Wood, Enoch, An Account of the Pirates Executed at St. Christopher's, in the West Indies, in 1828, London: John Mason (1830) As a result of its bloody history, the fac\u00f3n and similar knives were frequently outlawed over the years in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil, though without much outward effect. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the fac\u00f3n as a close combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly for use as a meat carving or utility knife. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments \"of honor\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping the fight when one of the participants could no longer see clearly as the result of blood seeping from one or more facial cuts.F. Molina Campos: He Paints the Cowboys of the Argentine Pampas Life Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 25, June 20, 1938, p. 35 ==Description== An 1830 article on the fac\u00f3n carried by the gaucho of that era describes it as a \"carving knife\" with a blade fourteen inches in length; it was carried in a leather sheath worn either in a waist sash or tucked into leggings.Head, F.B. (Capt.), Buenos Ayres and the Pampas, American Quarterly Review, Vol. XVI (December 1830), Philadelphia, PA: Carey & Lee Publishers, p. 279 Most examples of the fac\u00f3n have crude decorations and are poorly fitted. Some examples were converted from cut-down swords, while others used blades imported from as far away as England. ==The fac\u00f3n in use== Gauchos demonstrate use of facones The fac\u00f3n is both a fighting knife and a utility knife, and is widely used in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. The knife is typically worn at the back and tucked into the gaucho's belt to allow it to be quickly drawn with the right hand. As a fighting knife, the fac\u00f3n is the main article of combat in an indigenous style of knife fighting known as escrima criolla (\"Creole fencing\") When used in this context, one hand holds the knife, and a poncho or coat is wrapped about the opposite arm to absorb cuts and stabs in a manner reminiscent of traditional Andalusian knife fighting styles using the long-bladed Spanish clasp knife or navaja sevillana.de Rementeria y Fica, Manual of the Baratero, pp 5-6, 9, 12: The escrima de criolla method of knife fighting employed by the gaucho and his fac\u00f3n in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, using clothing to protect the weaponless arm, is derived directly from el legado andal\u00faz.Estrada, Santiago, Miscel\u00e1nea: El Duelo, p. 249: \"Entre las reliquias de la Conquista que el nuestro conserva, se cuenta la afici\u00f3n de los caballeros espa\u00f1oles \u00e1 desnudar la espada, transmitida en la madre patria al majo, educado en la plaza de toros. El fac\u00f3n es hermano leg\u00edtimo de la navaja sevillana.\" As Charles Darwin said of the distinctive men who wore and used the fac\u00f3n, \"Many quarrels arose, which from the general manner of fighting with the knife often proved fatal.\" ==See also== *List of daggers ==Notes== ==References== *Darwin's Journal * * Category:Argentine culture Category:Daggers ",
