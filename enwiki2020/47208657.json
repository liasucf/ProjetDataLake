    "text": "Jon Hammes is the founder and managing partner of Hammes Company. He was formerly managing partner of Milwaukee's Trammel Crow real estate company. In July 2015, Hamm was named co-chair of Scott Walker's presidential fundraising campaign. ==Sports ownership== Hammes has an ownership interest in the Milwaukee Bucks. Hammes is an owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks. ==Heartland== In September 2000, Heartland arranged a two-year bond-sale transaction with the state pension agency. Two weeks later Heartland took huge write-downs on distressed or defaulted bonds in its funds. Heartland's transaction with the Wisconsin Investment Board attracted criticism as a sweetheart deal to help a local firm that was sorely in need of cash to meet redemption requests from Heartland fund shareholders. The investment board paid $8.3 million for the troubled bonds, whose value decreased to $2.3 million as of June 2001. In 2000, Heartland Advisors marked down the value of their funds, the Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond Fund and the Short Duration High-Yield Municipal Fund. The SEC estimated that shareholders lost about $80 million. Hammes was an independent director of the Heartland funds. The SEC issued a consent order requiring four of Heartland's independent directors, including John Hammes, to cease and desist violating securities laws through \"their negligent failure to adequately monitor the liquidity of the funds and to take adequate steps to address funds' pricing deficiencies.\" They agreed to the order without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. ==Wisconsin investment board== In 1996, Hammes was appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson to be chairman of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, a state agency responsible for investing the assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and six other trust funds established by the state. Heartland Advisors sold a portfolio of distressed bonds for $8.3 million to the pension fund of the State of Wisconsin in late September 2000. Heartland officials were referred to the state board's staff by Hammes, and although he recused himself from the state board's consideration of the Heartland investment, the actions relationship was described as, \"at best, unseemly, and at worst, dangerous to the pension funds of thousands of state employees,\" by a co-chairman of the state legislature's Joint Audit Committee. ==Tomahawk Timberlands== Jon Hammes was the managing partner of the Brookfield-based Tomahawk Timberlands and Tomahawk Highlands logging and development companies, which purchased over 78,000 acres of Wisconsin timberland from the Packaging Corp. of America in 1999. In 2002, the federal government and the state of Wisconsin paid Tomahawk $7.25 million for conservation easements to permanently restrict development on 35,337 acres in Iron Oneida, Marathon, and Lincoln Counties. Most of this land was sold in 2007 to the Potlatch REIT for $64.5 million, which later sold to various TIMOs, public agencies, NGO's, and smaller private buyers. In 2015, the Hammes Family still owned over a thousand acres of forestland through the Badger II Limited Partnership and HC 100 LLC. ==Hammes Co. sports and entertainment arm== The division, headed by Robert P. Dunn, worked on the Lambeau Field renovation project, as well as Ford Field in Detroit. The division also worked with the University of Wisconsin Madison in connection with the construction of the Kohl Center and was named the owner's representative for the new $975 million Minnesota Vikings football stadium in Minneapolis. ==Milwaukee Bucks arena== In 2014, The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce hired the sports and entertainment arm of the Hammes Co. to provide advice on whether a new, multipurpose sports arena should be built, or whether the BMO Harris Bradley Center should be renovated. Hammes also provided advice on the process of planning for a new arena or retrofitting the 25-year-old BMO Harris Bradley Center. ==Hammes Co Health Care== Hammes Co Health care has developed more than 500 health care facilities and manages 4 million square feet of health care real estate. ==Hammes Partners II== Hammes is founder of a $450 million private equity fund to buy real estate called Hammes Partners II.
