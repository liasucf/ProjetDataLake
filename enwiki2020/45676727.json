The constituency division is based on the counties of Estonia, of which some are combined or divided depending on the size of the population. The capital city Tallinn is divided into three electoral districts based on administrative districts within the city. In the elections to the European Parliament, Estonia has only one national electoral district. ==Map of electoral districts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Electoral districts of Estonia |- ! rowspan=\"17\" style=\"background-color:white\" | 300px !
