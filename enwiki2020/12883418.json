Young Chinese high-fin banded sharks normally possess brown bodies bearing three dark-colored slanting bands. During the breeding season, adult males are distinguished from adult females by their red coloration. Adult females are of dark purple color with a broad and vertical reddish area along the body. Juveniles of the Chinese high-fin banded sharks are also characterized by high and triangular dorsal finnage that extends up to the rear of the anal fin. The adult appearance is far less distinctive, as they are elongated in shape without the very high dorsal fin. The thick and fleshy lips bear small papillae without barbels. They have a single row of pharyngeal teeth that have comb-like arrangements. Through adulthood, Chinese high-fin banded sharks become darker in appearance. The characteristic pale bands found in young specimens disappear at a length of , and the species has been referred to as an \"ugly duckling in reverse\". The growth is fast; it typically reaches a length of about in its first year and by an age of three.Chen, P. (2008).

They migrate into relatively fast flowing, shallow headwaters to spawn, but spend the remaining time in the main river sections. The population in the Min River, a tributary of the Yangtze, may have been extirpated. The species is widely cultured in China to supply the food industry.Lin, Y.; Y. Gong; Y. Yuan; S. Gong; D.
