    "text": "The Perl-UNC Prize is awarded internationally in the field of neuroscience. Its purpose is two-fold: to recognize researchers for outstanding discoveries and seminal insights in neuroscience and to celebrate the strength of the neuroscience research program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ==Creation== Edward Perl (1926-2014), a neuroscientist and former professor of Cell Biology & Physiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, established the prize in 2000 to recognize outstanding scientific contribution in neuroscience. He had envisioned that the selection committee would choose recipients \"from a broad field of neuroscience ranging from development to molecular mechanisms to integrative function.\" Perl further noted that \"[t]he prize allows me to acknowledge the university for the opportunities it has given me\" and that it \"would help call attention to the institution and our strength in neuroscience.\" As of 2017, six recipients of the Perl-UNC Prize have gone on to win Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine (Linda Buck, Richard Axel, May-Britt Moser, Edvard Moser) or Chemistry (Roger Tsien, Roderick MacKinnon). Three winners of the Perl-UNC Prize (Thomas Jessell, Cori Bargmann, Marcus Raichle) have been awarded the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience. ==Recipients== Source: UNC Neuroscience Center * 2000 David Julius, Cloning the Capsaicin Receptor.Leslie H.
