Upon succeeding his father, King Cunincpert, at a young age, he ruled together with his tutor, Ansprand, the duke of Asti. After eight months, he was deposed by Raginpert, the duke of Turin and son of Godepert, Liutpert's great-uncle, but succeeded in returning to the throne several months later upon Raginpert's death, only to be deposed again, taken captive from Pavia, and drowned by Aripert II, Raginpert's son. ==Notes == Category:7th-century births Category:702 deaths Category:7th-century kings of Italy Category:8th-century kings of Italy Category:Lombard kings Category:Rulers deposed as children Category:Medieval child rulers Category:8th-century murdered monarchs Category:7th-century Lombard people Category:8th-century Lombard people Category:7th-century monarchs in Europe Category:8th-century monarchs in Europe Category:Bavarian dynasty Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People executed by drowning ",
