    "text": "Jewel Quest is a tile-matching puzzle video game created and published by iWin. First released for Windows, it has been redeveloped for Symbian S60, the Nintendo DS (as Jewel Quest: Expeditions), the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade and other platforms. iWin also released a series of sequels and spin-off games. == Gameplay == Jewel Quest is a \"match 3\" puzzle played on a grid filled with various tokens, such as diamonds, gold nuggets, coins, and skulls. The player may swap any two adjacent tiles, as long as the swap results in a horizontal or vertical line of three or more matching tokens. The matched set disappears, allowing tokens to drop into the gaps from above; if more matched sets form as a result, they disappear as well. Whenever tiles disappear, the background grid positions turn gold. The player must turn every square on the board to gold in order to complete the level. Failing to do so within the given time limit, or reaching a situation in which no more swaps are possible, costs one life and sends the player back to the start of that level. As the game progresses, new variations are introduced to make gameplay increasingly difficult: irregularly-shaped grids, squares in hard-to-reach places, tokens that must be matched multiple times to clear them from the board, etc. ===Jewel Quest=== Jewel Quest has 180 levels and is set within the Mayan culture. There are 36 grids and they are played through, in succession, five times, with each play-through adding a new level of difficulty. During the first run-through, \"Explorer,\" the player is given pieces of storyline in the form of \"journal entries\" to read after completing each grid, with an additional snippet before the beginning of each level. After playing the 36th grid, the totem \"speaks\" in addition to there being a written blurb. After the \"Explorer\" level, new information is given only at the end of the 36th level, and once after playing the 1-2 grid during the second run-through. All other \"journal entries\" are quotes or sayings to encourage the player. Likewise, if the player fails to complete a level within the time frame, encouraging quotes will be used. ===Jewel Quest II=== Jewel Quest II has 180 levels. After each level, the player advances along a map representing a journey in Africa. Additional jewels are added. Again, there are 36 boards to play, with each play-through increasing in difficulty. For Jewel Quest II, the boards are not necessarily the same as in the previous play-through. Also, while in the original Jewel Quest, blank squares are obstacles, the player is allowed to move jewels into empty squares in the grid in Jewel Quest II, introducing new strategy. The player's character is revealed to be named Rupert Pack, and the story revolves around him searching for a \"Legendary Jewel Board\" in Africa, as well as a romantic subplot with a woman named \"Emma Swimmingly\" and a villain named \"Sebastian Grenard.\" Emma and Sebastian each receive their own first-person text entries for an entire play-through, though the final play- through is given by Rupert. The background reflects the location of the characters within the story. ===Jewel Quest III=== Jewel Quest III's levels range throughout the world. The new globe interface allows the player to select from different regions to play. Mexico, Iceland, Europe, Africa, South America, Australia, China, Alaska, East Asia, and Hawaii are the regions. In each region, there are several locations to choose from and each level has multiple passes. New to Jewel Quest III is that some of the jewels have special properties. == Scoring and lives == When a set of tiles are matched, points are gained based on the number of tiles matched and the number of \"cascaded\" matches that have occurred. \"Cursed\" black tiles appear in later levels; directly matching a set of these deducts points and erases the gold behind them. However, the cursed tiles can be safely removed through a \"cascaded\" match. If the player runs out of time on a level, or reaches a point where there are no moves possible, he or she loses a life and must start the level over. An additional life is granted for every 50,000 points earned. == Games == The Jewel Quest series has evolved since its beginnings starting with Match 3 games, and later including playing card games and hidden object games, starting on PC and later porting to consoles and mobile devices. ===Windows === ==== Match 3 ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest || 2/09/2005 |-u | style=\"text- align:left\" | Jewel Quest 2 || 2/09/2007 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest 3 || 6/12/2008 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest: Heritage || 12/10/2009 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest: The Sleepless Star || 10/07/2010 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest: The Sapphire Dragon || 10/20/2011 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest: Seven Seas || 10/28/2016 |} ==== Playing card ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:right\" |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Solitaire|| 8/28/2007 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Solitaire 2|| 8/28/2007 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Solitaire 3|| 3/05/2009 |} ==== Hidden object ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | Jewel Quest Mysteries: Curse of the Emerald Tear|| 9/11/2008 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Mysteries 2: Trail of the Midnight Heart|| 7/16/2009 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Mysteries: The Seventh Gate|| 4/01/2011 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Mysteries: The Oracle of Ur|| 3/09/2012 |} === Consoles === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest|| Xbox 360|| 3/03/2006|| Match 3 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Expedition|| Nintendo DS|| 2/01/2008|| Match 3 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | The Quest Trio|| Nintendo DS|| 8/26/2008|| Match 3, Playing Cards |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Mysteries|| Nintendo DS|| 11/03/2009|| Hidden Object |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Trilogy|| Wii|| 2/04/2011|| Match 3, Hidden Object |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Solitaire Trio|| Nintendo DS|| 2/11/2011|| Playing Cards |} === Mobile === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest 3: World Adventure|| Mobile|| 2010|| Match 3 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | Jewel Quest: Curse of the Emerald Tear|| iPhone|| 2010|| Hidden Object |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest|| iPhone, iPad|| 2011|| Match 3 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Jewel Quest Heritage || Android|| 2012|| Match 3 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | JQ Mysteries: The 7th Gate || Android|| 2012|| Hidden Object |} == External links == * Official iWin website * VGT review of Nintendo DS version of Jewel Quest: Expeditions ==References== Category:2004 video games Category:MacOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Match 3 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Casual games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Tile-matching video games ",
