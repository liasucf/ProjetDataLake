    "text": "The Irop'a is a Korean textbook of the Japanese language published in 1492. It is a source on the phonology of Late Middle Japanese. The Irop'a is named in official Korean list of textbooks for Japanese dated 1430, 1469 and 1707. It was presumably revised after the introduction of the Hangul alphabet in 1446. Only one copy of the Irop'a is known today, an edition printed in 1492. This copy was in the collection of Kanbara Jinz\u014d, president of Kagawa University, and first publicized in 1959. It is now held by the university library. The work begins with four forms of the Japanese syllabary, each in the order of the Iroha poem: hiragana, two forms of mana (cursive Chinese characters), and katakana. Each hiragana syllable is accompanied by a transcription of its sound using Hangul. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Transcriptions of Japanese syllables in the Irop'a |- ! !! colspan=\"10\" | Japanese initial consonant |- !

The reasons for including the first two characters are unclear. Following the syllabaries is a brief summary of the Japanese writing system, written in Chinese. The bulk of the text is in Japanese without translation or annotation, consisting of model sentences and descriptions of Japanese people and customs. == Notes == == References == Works cited * * * * * * Category:Joseon Dynasty works Category:Late Middle Japanese texts Category:15th-century books ",
