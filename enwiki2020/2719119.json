    "text": "Gordon John Ross (1917 - 27 April 1985) was a sports journalist and author, and a vice-president of Lancashire CCC. He was closely associated with numerous cricket publications. He succeeded Peter West as editor of the Playfair Cricket Annual in 1954, remaining in this role until his death. He edited the Cricketer Quarterly Facts and Figures and also the Playfair Cricket Monthly throughout the thirteen years of its existence. He was an associate editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack (under Norman Preston) between 1978 and 1980, for whom he reviewed books (1979 and 1980) and wrote articles. His brochures covered football of both codes (he edited the Playfair Rugby Annual for many years) and his books included one on the University Boat Race, as well as a short history of cricket and other histories of Surrey CCC, such as The Surrey Story, West Indian cricket and the Gillette Cup. He worked regularly as a sports journalist for the Sunday Times, The Times, The Scotsman and the Sunday Telegraph. As a consultant to Gillette and subsequently NatWest, he had been directly involved with one-day county cricket since its inception in 1963. Although he was a consultant to Gillette, he refused to use its products. He was a well-known and popular figure around English cricket grounds, always dapper and seldom seen without a red carnation in his buttonhole. He died at Lord's after watching a day's cricket. ==References== ==External links== * Wisden obituary Category:1918 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Print editors Category:English male journalists Category:Cricket historians and writers Category:English rugby union commentators Category:Place of birth missing ",
