    "text": "Bloxwich railway station serves Bloxwich, in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, West Midlands, England. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Railway. ==History== The present station opened in 1989, as part of the first stage of the reopening of the Chase Line from Walsall to Hednesford to passenger trains under British Rail. An earlier Bloxwich station existed a few hundred yards to the south, just north of the level crossing and adjacent to the existing Bloxwich Signal Box (which in April 2011 retained its London Midland Region of British Railways white-on- maroon enamel sign). That station closed to passengers on 18 January 1965 and to goods on 10 August 1964. ==Services== Typically, Monday to Saturday daytimes, Bloxwich is served by two trains per hour in each direction between Birmingham New Street and Rugeley Trent Valley where connections to Stafford, Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe are available, although a small number of trains (2 per day on weekdays) start/terminate at Hednesford. Services are usually operated by Class 350 electric trains. During the morning and evening peak, trains to Walsall and Birmingham run at a 30-minute frequency. Journey times are typically 7 minutes to Walsall and 31 minutes to Birmingham New Street. The original London & North Western Railway station closed in 1965 ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Walsall Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:1858 establishments in England Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1858 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1965 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1989 Category:Railway stations served by West Midlands Trains Category:Beeching closures in England Category:Reopened railway stations in Great Britain ",
