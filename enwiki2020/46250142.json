I do not hesitate to synthesize them. I do not have a favorite color. There are no bad colors, we can combine the nuances. In my collages I use paper, cloth materials which come to replace paint. Unlike paint they make my works more interesting and (in a good sense) complex. By their colors and forms they help me to build my fantasy world and they give an unexpected turn while working. ==See also== *List of Armenian artists *List of Armenians *Culture of Armenia ==References== ==External links== * Nune Siravyan *Artslant Worldwide Nune Siravyan Category:1973 births Category:Armenian painters Category:Living people Category:Artists from Yerevan Category:Armenian women painters ",
