    "text": "Khaosai Galaxy (, born, May 15, 1959) is a former Thai professional super flyweight (also known as junior bantamweight) boxer and Muaythai kickboxer. Khaosai defended his WBA world title 19 times in seven years (1984\u20131991), winning 16 of his title fights by knockouts. He is listed #19 on Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time and named him the 43rd greatest fighter of the past 80 years in 2002. ==Muay Thai career== Khaosai was born as Sura Saenkham () in Phetchabun Province, Northern Thailand. He was a Muay Thai fighter in the early 1980s, and took the professional name Galaxy from a restaurant and nightclub owned by his manager's friend. Khaosai had tremendous punching power, particularly in his soon-to-be legendary left hand. On the advice of his manager and trainer, he switched to Marquis of Queensbury style and began training as a western style boxer. In Muay Thai his ring names are Daoden Muangsithep () and Khaosai Wangchomphu. () ==Boxing style== Lacking the amateur boxing experience common to most Western professional boxers, Khaosai's skills originally were limited, and he relied on toughness and his fearsome punching power to win. His southpaw style was based on closing his opponent and firing his left hand whenever he saw an opening. His right hand was used mainly to judge the distance for his left. All of his knockouts came by his left, which is arguably the hardest single punch in the history of the lower weight classes. As he gained experience, Khaosai began to develop into a more refined boxer, learning combination punching to complement his deadly left. His favorite punch, a straight left to the midsection, translates roughly as \"the left hand that drills intestines.\" Incredibly strong, he was never out-muscled, while opponents who tried the traditional stick-and-move techniques found he had quick feet and was able to block their movements. ==Boxing career== Khaosai began his international style boxing career in December 1980. He won all of his first six fights, which earned him a shot at the Thailand bantamweight (118-pound) title on July 29, 1981 against Sakda Saksuree. He lost on a points decision. It was to be the last fight he would ever lose in the ring. Khaosai won his next three fights and claimed the Thai bantamweight title in 1982. He won 15 consecutive fights by knockout and climbed in the world rankings to become super flyweight (115-pound) WBA world champion Jiro Watanabe's mandatory challenger by the summer of 1984. When Watanabe failed to defend his title against Khaosai, the WBA stripped him and matched Khaosai against undefeated Eusebio Espinal for the vacant championship on November 21, 1984. Khaosai knocked out Espinal in the sixth round, beginning the longest title reign in his division's history. Khaosai defended his WBA title 19 times over the next seven years, winning 16 of his title fights by knockouts. In the mid-1980s, when world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was in his prime and scoring knockouts over everyone, boxing fans nicknamed Khaosai The Thai Tyson for knockout wins. Khaosai fought only once outside of Asia, when he defended his title in 1986 against unbeaten (and future WBA bantamweight titleholder) Israel Contreras in Cura\u00e7ao. He had two title fights in K\u014dbe, Japan, one in South Korea and one at Bung Karno Stadium, Indonesia. The rest were in Thailand, where he often fought for purses in excess of $100,000 in front of huge crowds. That, plus the fact that few top fighters anywhere were willing to challenge Khaosai, made him relatively unknown in the West. In 1988, his twin elder brother, fighting under the name Kaokor Galaxy, captured the WBA bantamweight title, making the Saenkham brothers the first twins to ever be world boxing champions. Khaosai Galaxy in 2007 ==Retirement== He fought for the last time on December 21, 1991 in Bangkok, beating Armando Castro over 12 rounds. A few weeks later, he announced his retirement with a record of 50 wins against only one defeat, and never attempted a comeback. ==Life after boxing== Not long after his retirement to the boxing profession, Khaosai chose to take part in the Thai entertainment industry. He first took a shot at the music industry, releasing a single, \"Khob Khun Krub\", meaning \"Thank You\", then began taking part in TV series and movies, particularly comedies. His first role as an actor occurred during the TV series Poot Mae Nam Khong (1992 version), which was then followed by Monrak luk thung (1995 version), The Legend of Suriyothai (2001), and The Bodyguard (2004) etc. In 2005, while he was taking part in a film, he was punched in the face by a drunken fan, who wished to obtain Khaosai's shirt for collection but was denied. The incident made frontline news, which displayed a photo of Khaosai, with a bandage on his face but smiling and standing next to the drunk man. In 2006, he starred in a music video for a song by fellow boxers Somluck Kamsing and Samart Payakaroon. In the video, Khaosai portrayed a shy man being approached by a young woman. After retirement, he married the Japanese Yumiko Ota, whom he had met during a trip for his second fight with Kenji Matsumura in K\u014dbe, Japan in 1989. The couple lived together for only one year, and later divorced. He later married a Buriram woman, Sureerat \"Fah\" Saenkham (n\u00e9e Niwesram). They had no children together, but Khaosai chose to take his wife's nephew as a stepchild. In March 2013, he made news again when he unexpectedly was married again, this time to Wannapa \"Nung\" Kamboonsri, before obtaining a legal divorce from his previous wife. In 2013, he finally became a father at the age of 54, when his wife safely delivered a daughter. In 2016, his wife delivered a second daughter by the end of the year. Currently, he owns two Muay Thai gyms in Bangkok and Phuket, and was a trainer for Denkaosan Kaovichit in the fight against Takefumi Sakata which took place by the end of 2008 in Yokohama, Japan. (Denkaosan knocked his opponent out by the second round, becoming the next WBA flyweight champion). Besides boxing and entertainment, Khaosai has also flirted with politics. During the 2007 Thai general election, he was a candidate in the party-list of the Puea Pandin Party, but lost. Additionally, during the 2011 Thai general election, he became a candidate on behalf of the Chartthaipattana Party for his native Phetchabun 2nd district, but lost with only 8,485 votes. ==Honors== He was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1999 and remains a well known Boxer throughout Thailand. He is the first Thai boxer to mark the beginning of the ceremony, offering gold necklaces and other prizes to Thai boxers before the every bout. It started with his retained the ninth title against the Korean contender Tae-Il Chang at Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Samut Prakan in early 1989. And every time he fought, there was a saying that traffic in Bangkok was good, because everyone rushed home to see him on TV. ==References== ==External links== *Khosai Galaxy Muay Thai Gym official Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Thai male Muay Thai practitioners Category:Super-flyweight boxers Category:World boxing champions Category:World super-flyweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Category:Thai politicians Category:Twin people from Thailand Category:People from Phetchabun Province Category:Thai male boxers Category:Muay Thai trainers Category:Boxing trainers ",
