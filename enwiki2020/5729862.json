    "text": "The President of the Council of State is the leader of Luxembourg's Council of State. He or she is appointed by the Grand Duke, along with two Vice Presidents, and the appointment lasts for one year (although it can be renewed). The President of the Council of State must be either a member of the Council of State or the Grand Duke himself. However, to date, the latter option has never been taken, and it has become convention that the Grand Duke cannot be the President. Note that the position has often been left vacant, so few of the successions were immediate. ==List of presidents== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" ! President ! Start date !
