    "text": "Major Yadollah Javadpour () was a fighter pilot in the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, serving for the duration of the Iran\u2013Iraq War. His record qualifies him as an ace and one of the most successful pilots of that conflict.Imperial Iranian Air Force: Samurai in the skies ==Career== He began his service as a pilot in the IIAF and was a member of the elite Iranian Air Force flying team, the Golden Crown, from 1975 to 1978. He continued to serve with the IRIAF after the revolution, at a time when it was dangerous for pilots to do so. ===Iran\u2013Iraq War=== Javadpour's notoriety came while flying the Northrop F-5. He claimed 5 air victories, which makes him an ace, but only two have been reliably confirmed by western sources.Arabian Peninsula & Persian Gulf Database: Iranian Air-to-Air Victories, 1976-1981, Sept. 16, 2003Arabian Peninsula & Persian Gulf Database: Iranian Air-to-Air Victories, 1982-Today, Sept. 16, 2003 His greatest fame came on August 6, 1983 when he claimed (later to be reliably confirmed) to have shot down an Iraqi MiG-25. This was a significant achievement for an F-5 pilot as the MiG-25 is a much bigger and faster aircraft with a substantial altitude advantage. His other confirmed kill was an Su-20 on 17 October 1980. These results make Javadpour one of the most successful F-5 fighter pilots ever. ==See also== * Iranian aerial victories during the Iran-Iraq war ==Notes== ==References== Category:Iranian aviators Category:Iran\u2013Iraq War flying aces Category:Islamic Republic of Iran Army personnel of the Iran\u2013Iraq War Category:Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force personnel Category:Iranian flying aces Category:Living people Category:Golden Crown Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
