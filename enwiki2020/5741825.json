    "text": "\"Nostalgija\" (English translation: \"Nostalgia\") was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995, performed in Croatian by Magazin and Lidija. The song was performed eleventh on the night (following Turkey's Arzu Ece with \"Sev\" and preceding France's Nathalie Santamaria with \"Il me donne rendez- vous\"). At the close of voting, it had received 91 points, placing 6th in a field of 23. The song is inspired by the proverb \"Silence makes the heart grow fonder\", with the performers singing about the nostalgia felt for an absent lover. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 1996 Contest by Maja Blagdan with \"Sveta ljubav\". Category:Eurovision songs of 1995 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:1995 songs ",
