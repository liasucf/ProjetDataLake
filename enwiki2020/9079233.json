The topics of the show ranged from \"Is gay OK?\" to \"Gay Art\". The program was somehow controversial, even before the first episode aired. The most notable guests so included Maciej Nowak and Krystian Legierski. . == See also == * Gay life in Poland ==External links== * Category:Polish LGBT-related television shows Category:Polish television series ",
