It was later reissued in the U.S. by V2 Records. === Reception === The album was well-received by music critics. CMJ New Music Monthly described it as \"an eccentric psych-pop collection\". Andy Gill of The Independent called it \"one of the most beguiling debuts of the year [...] a fortuitous collision of Brian Wilson, Neil Young and the Pixies which throws out a stream of understated pop gems\". AllMusic noted similarities to the bands Pavement and Weezer, and described it as \"a fairly brilliant album, combining a warm, earnest and rustic feel with sometimes goofy experimentation\". Frontman Jason Lytle's vocal performance was also praised; Jason Josephes of Pitchfork wrote: \"If the lonely vocals of 'Lineage' and 'Collective Dreamwish of Upperclass Elegance' don't strike you there, you have no soul\". Steve Taylor wrote in his book The A to X of Alternative Music that \"Laughing Stock\" is the album's standout track. == Track listing == == References == == External links == * Category:1997 debut albums Category:Grandaddy albums ",
