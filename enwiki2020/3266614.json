    "text": "Jaume Ferran i Clua (Corbera d'Ebre, 1851 - Barcelona 1929) was a Spanish bacteriologist and sanitarian , contemporary of Koch, and said by his fellows to have made some of the discoveries attributed to Koch. As early as 1885, he wrote on immunization against cholera. In 1893, his work on this subject was translated into French with the title L'Inoculation pr\u00e9ventive contre le Cholera. Tuberculosis is another disease in which Ferran was always deeply interested. Some of his ideas on the transmission and virulence of tuberculosis are revolutionary. He died in 1929 and was buried in Montju\u00efc Cemetery, Barcelona. == Bibliography == * U. TRUJILLANO, Ferr\u00e1n, su obra sanitaria, Madrid 1945; * G.
