    "text": "Culture11, also stylized Culture 11, was a short-lived right-leaning American online magazine active from August 27, 2008 until January 27, 2009. It portrayed itself as a \"center-right Slate\", with a focus on cultural and media criticism. It was founded by William Bennett and run by David Kuo. Despite rumors that the site had enough funding to last through 2010, it shut down on January 27, 2009 after running out of the money it had raised, and after its investors also lost considerable assets due to the 2008 financial crisis. Among the alumni of Culture11 are Conor Friedersdorf, who served as its features editor, Peter Suderman, who was its arts editor, and James Poulos, who served as its political editor and went on to become the managing editor of Ricochet. ==References== Category:Conservative magazines published in the United States Category:American conservative websites Category:Online magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct political magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 2008 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2009 ",
