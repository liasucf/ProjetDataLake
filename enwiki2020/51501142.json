The Vihara is also known as punchi Seegiriya (Little Sigiriya) by the locals since the temple contain ancient frescoes similar to Sigiriya. The site is in Kotmale Canal Settlement in Wewagampattuwa Division and lies about east of Kohombana Junction on Ampara \u2013 Gonagolla Road. The temple has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. The designation was declared on 10 October 2014 under the government Gazette number 1884. ==History== The ruined Stupa There are clear evidence that the rock caves of the temple were occupied by ancient Vedda people by finding their paintings in nearby premises. Among one of the rock caves, the remains of ancient frescoes, similar to Sigiriya can be seen. Two more cave in the Vihara premises contains Brahmi rock inscriptions dating back to 3-5th centuries. Although it is believed that some constructions in the Vihara belong to the third century BC. The remains of two ancient ponds, and the Stupa of Anuradhapura era, next to the frescoes cave, are example for them. Among other ruins a Vatadage, Chatra stones, remains of large scale buildings with carved stone pillars and rock stairways can be seen around the vihara premises. ==Frescoes== In 1956 the Archaeological Department found out some remnants of frescoes belong to the 3rd century AD on vaulted ceiling of a cave in Gonagolla temple. The frescoes have been drawn on a special plastered surface and depict a scene of young female dancer and a man who is alleged to be a Bodhisattva. The female figure is almost identical to famous Sigiriya maidens (5th century) and both figures have been painted using red, yellow, green and white colors with sharp margins. Due to the frescoes, this temple is called Punchi Sigiriya (Little Sigiriya) by locals. Except these frescoes there are some pre-historic paintings drawn by Vedda people can be seen in few rock caves of temple premises. ==Vihara inscriptions== ===Rock inscriptions set 1=== ===Rock inscriptions set 2=== ==References== ==Notes== * Category:Buddhist temples in Ampara District Category:Buddhist caves in Sri Lanka Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Ampara District Category:Sri Lanka inscriptions ",
