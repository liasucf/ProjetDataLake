The event of Al-Ukhdud occurred in 520 or 523 ACE, in the time of Dhu Nuwas, the last Himyarite King. == Story in other sources == There are different stories about the people of the Ditch. One of them is a hadith (, 'account', 'narration' or 'report') about a Malik (, King) that had a sahir (, magician) in the days before Muhammad. As the magician grew old and his lifetime was nearly over, he asked the King to choose a smart boy to learn sihr (, magic) from him. However, as the boy was training in magic, he met a monk everyday on the way to the magic class, and finally became a true believer in God. As a result, he could save people and treat sick people in unusual ways. When the King learned of this, he commanded the boy to abandon his faith in God. The boy rejected the King's command, so he was killed. The King also burned those who followed the boy's deen (, religion), in one or more ditches.Abdul Malik bin Hisham Ibn Hisham, Biography of the Prophet, Darol-Ma'refah Publication, Beirut, vol.1, pp.35\u201336, 1355 H.Sh.Muhammad Bal'ami, History of the Prophets and Kings, Sorosh Publication, Tehran, vol.2, pp.121\u2013122, 1378 H.Sh. Ibn Ishaq-Guillaume interpreted this passage to be an allusion to the killing of the Christians of Najran by order of the King Dhu Nuwas. According to Christian sources, this event took place around 523 C.E. Dhu Nuwas converted to Judaism and chose Joseph as his new name. He went to Najran to force the Christian people there to convert to Judaism. When they refused, the King threw them alive into one or more burning ditches.Encyclopaedia Of The Quran, Jane Dammen McAuliffe, vol.2, pp.147\u2013148 There is also a hadith that God chose a Nabi (, Prophet) in Abyssinia, but the people of Abyssinia denied him. At last Prophet and his companions () were burned in a ditch. It is reported that companions of Daniyal (Daniel) were burned in a ditch Some say it happened several times in several places such as Yemen, Constantinople, Babylon, Iraq, and Al-Sham; and that this story is not about just one such event. == In media == The animated film, The Boy and the King, is a movie about people of the ditch. == See also == * \u02bf\u0100d * People of Lut (Lot) * People of Ya-Sin * Thamud * The Pharaoh of the Exodus * The verse of Ikmal al-Din * The verse of loan * The verse of Wilayah * The Verse of brotherhood * The verse of purification * The warning verse * The verse of evil eye * The obedience verse * Muhammad in the Quran * The Battle of Karbala\u2019 == References == Category:Quranic verses Ditch ",
