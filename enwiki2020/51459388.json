    "text": "Legacy is an album by the Gerald Wilson Orchestra recorded in 2011 and released on the Mack Avenue label.Mack Avenue catalog, accessed August 26, 2016 ==Reception== AllMusic rated the album with 4\u00bd stars; in his review, Ken Dryden noted: \"This outstanding recording adds to the already substantial discography of the great Gerald Wilson\". In JazzTimes Bill Beuttler wrote: \"Gerald Wilson\u2019s new album, Legacy, is aptly titled. His son Anthony Wilson and grandson Eric Otis each contribute a composition to the project, which is anchored by Wilson\u2019s own seven-part suite \"Yes Chicago Is\u2026\", a celebration of his home through much of the 1940s. Wilson, who turns 93 in September, conducted a standout band of 20 for the session\".Beuttler, B. JazzTimes review August 26, 2011 On All About Jazz Raul D'Gama Rose noted: \"Aside from the sophistication of the music\u2014putting it in a stellar region all its own\u2014Wilson digs ever so deeply into his own heart and soul, and finds the magical element of the blues in its most visceral and elemental form. That and the almost vanishing aspect of great jazz: swing\".Rose, R D.
