Calaboose were mainly used to incarcerate prisoners for minor crimes, such as drunkenness in public or fighting, or as a temporary holding cell for when a prisoner awaited transportation to a county jail. Use of the calaboose was common throughout much of the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and today surviving examples can be found in several states. Texas, with its large number of counties, has the highest concentration of historic calaboose jail buildings with over 100 known structures. Many calaboose have only a single cell, feature a curved or vaulted ceiling, and were constructed of solid concrete, although brick, stone and wooden examples also survive. ;Examples * Arrow Rock Calaboose: Stone structure with vaulted ceiling in Arrow Rock, Missouri. Built in 1873 to replace the original log jail building that was burned by an arsonist in 1872.
