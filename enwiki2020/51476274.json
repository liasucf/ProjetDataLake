The show follows real-life couple Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher as they share their lives as stand-up comics who are balancing work, relationships, and the breaking down of gender barriers. On December 19, 2016, Seeso renewed the series for a second season. On August 9, 2017, Seeso announced the shutdown of its service by the end of the year, leaving Take My Wife without a home. On March 5, 2018, it was announced that season 1 and the previously unaired season 2 were now available on iTunes (US) and would be available on the Starz app starting May 1, 2018. Take My Wife is also now available on iTunes in the UK (as of April 30, 2018). For its second season, the show's creators and producers featured large numbers of women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals in front of and behind the camera. Esposito has acknowledged this was a conscious effort on their part: \"As a small budget show, we prioritized hiring queer folks, POC, and female standups.\" == Cast == ===Main=== * Cameron Esposito as Cameron Esposito * Rhea Butcher as Rhea Butcher * Zeke Nicholson as Dave * Laura Kightlinger as Frances ===Guest stars=== * Eliza Skinner as Eliza * Jonah Ray as Podcast Host * Alice Wetterlund as Alice * Gaby Dunn as Brie * Janet Varney as Melina Marquez * Matt Braunger as Bob Herzog * Maria Bamford as herself * Kulap Vilaysack as Danielle * Joe DeRosa as Kent * Sam Jay as Sam Jay * Tawny Newsome as Pam * Chris Farah as Pam * James Adomian as Tony * Mary Grill as Firefighter * Kurt Braunohler as Daniel * Mary Lynn Rajskub as herself * Tess Paras as Miranda * Marcella Arguello as Waitress * Ahmed Bharoocha as Jimmy the delivery guy * Paul F.
