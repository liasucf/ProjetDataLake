The review was headed by Salim. Salim held consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in 2002 and 2003. The EIR recommendations were published in January 2004 in a final report entitled Striking a Better Balance. The report concluded that fossil fuel and mining projects do not alleviate poverty and recommended that World Bank involvement with these sectors be phased out by 2008 to be replaced by investment in renewable energy and clean energy. The World Bank published its Management Response to the EIR in September 2004. The EIR served to alter the World Bank's policies on oil, gas and mining. Following the EIR process, the World Bank also issued a revised Policy on Indigenous Peoples. ==References== * reprinted as 'Emil Salim' in Thee Kian Wie (ed), 2003, Recollections: the Indonesian economy, 1950s - 1990s.
