    "text": "Jamie Brown (born 1980) is a British classical composer who studied with Judith Weir in London. He is also a professional linguist and has previously lived in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Musically, he is predominantly interested in vocal music, particularly for the stage, and influences range from Judith Weir and Benjamin Britten to Bj\u00f6rk, Sigur R\u00f3s and folk music from around the world. Jamie set up The Language and Music Partnership in 2015 - a group of young professional linguists, writers and musicians with cross-disciplinary interests who initiate, create and produce projects combining both fields. The role of musical projects in the promotion and regeneration of endangered languages is a particular interest, and A Cornish Requiem (composed by Jamie Brown, with a specially commissioned poem by Cornish poet Pol Hodge) is their first large-scale event on this theme.
