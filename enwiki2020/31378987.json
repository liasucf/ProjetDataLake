    "text": "Fu Nai (AD 1758-1811) was a statesman who made himself famous by his skillful treatment of the aborigines of Hunan. He first conquered and disarmed them, and then set to work to teach them to cultivate the arts of peace. He was particularly successful as a military leader, though himself actually a civilian. In 1809 he rose to be Judge in Hunan, and was ordered, by special request of the aborigines, to visit their territory once a year.Herbert Allen Giles, A Chinese Biographical Dictionary, p. 240.
