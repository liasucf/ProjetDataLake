Berbice foundered in 1806 off Demerara. ==Career== Early in 1802, Kenau Hasselar, under the command of Captain Cornelius (or Cornelis) Hubertus Buschman, was assigned to the East Indies and Cape of Good Hope division of the Navy. After the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the British ceded the Dutch colonies they had captured in the West Indies to the Batavian Republic. In August 1802, Buschman and Kenau Hasselar took a small squadron that also included the frigate Proserpina, the corvette , the cutter Rose, and the schooner Serpent, to take possession of Cura\u00e7ao. Around 8 May 1803 Serpent fired on Dutch mutineers that wanted to turn the colony of Berbice over to the British. The mutiny failed, though Serpents contribution to this result appears minimal.Southey (1827), Vol. 3, pp.242-243. On 23 September 1803 Heureux represented the Royal Navy at the capture of the Batavian Republic's colony at Berbice. The British captured the schooner Serpent, as well many arms, troops and the like. The Navy took Serpent into service as HMS Berbice and Admiral Sir Samuel Hood appointed Acting-Lieutenant James Glassford Gooding as her commander.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.405. The Navy registered and commissioned her in 1805 in the Leeward Islands.Winfield (2008), p.366. Gooding was confirmed in his rank on 20 November. Berbice foundered on 24 May 1806 off Demerara.
