    "text": "Puzzled Pint logo Puzzled Pint is a monthly, casual, social puzzle solving event. It is held every second Tuesday in 50+ cities around the world, with every location using the same puzzles. The global monthly attendance exceeds 3000. It follows the pattern of a conference-room style puzzle hunt, with teams receiving packets of 4-5 puzzles, usually with the answers feeding into a final Metapuzzle. Most cities rotate the location to a new bar every month. The Friday before each event, a location puzzle is posted to the website. Solving this puzzle will lead players to that month's \u201csecret\u201d location. Puzzled Pint is a not-for-profit, volunteer-run event, with a goal of introducing new players to the world of puzzlehunts. The emphasis is on the casual nature of the evening. The puzzles are not as advanced or numerous as day-long or weekend puzzle events, and hints are always free. An archive of all previous puzzles is on the website and available under a flexible Creative Commons license so that they may be repurposed for other events and activities. ==History== * Puzzled Pint was originally 5 people in July 2010 in Portland, Oregon; that city now sees a regular attendance of at least 100 players. * It expanded to include Seattle in October 2012. * Additional cities have been added over the years, to the current count of 60 locations and 3113 players in August 2018. ==Themes== Puzzled Pint has had a theme every month since September 2010.
