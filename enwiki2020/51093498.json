    "text": "The 2016\u201317 Principality Premiership was the first season of the new format of the Principality Premiership, the top tier of club rugby in Wales run by the Welsh Rugby Union. It was contested by sixteen Welsh clubs following an expansion from twelve teams. The next two seasons will be \"ring-fenced\" and will have no relegation until the 2018\u201319 season. The competition was won by Merthyr in their first season in the Premiership. The second-tier competition was won by Newport who won their first silverware since the 2003\u201304 Premiership season. == Structure == The Principality Premiership's structure includes all the teams playing each other once, either home or away, before the table is split into a top 8 and bottom 8 after 15 rounds and points are reset to zero. Each team then plays each other team once, again either home or away, in their respective tier. After all fixtures have been played, a play- off system is implemented for the top 4 teams in each section to determine the winner. The play-off winner of the top 8 will be crowned 2016\u201317 Principality Premiership champions. This is the first season in which the \"ring-fenced\" system will be implemented, meaning no team is in danger of relegation until the 2018\u201319 season. == Teams == After a two-season absence spent in the WRU Championship, Swansea returned to the Premiership finishing as runners-up in the 2015\u201316 WRU Championship. Also promoted to the Premiership, for the first time, were Championship winners Merthyr, Bargoed and RGC 1404, who narrowly finished above Pontypool to deny them a return to the Premiership after demotion in 2012. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !| Club !| Stadium !| Capacity !| Area |- | Aberavon | Talbot Athletic Ground | style=\"text- align:left;\" |3,000 | Port Talbot, Neath Port Talbot |- | Bargoed | Bargoed Park | style=\"text-align:left;\" |1,500 | Bargoed, Caerphilly |- | Bedwas | Bridge Field | style=\"text-align:left;\" |2,000 | Bedwas, Caerphilly |- | Bridgend | Brewery Field | style=\"text-align:left;\" |8,000 | Bridgend |- | Cardiff | Cardiff Arms Park | style=\"text-align:left;\" |12,125 | Cardiff |- | Carmarthen Quins | Carmarthen Park | style=\"text-align:left;\" |3,000 | Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire |- | Cross Keys | Pandy Park | style=\"text- align:left;\" |3,000 | Crosskeys, Caerphilly |- | Ebbw Vale | Eugene Cross Park | style=\"text-align:left;\" |8,000 | Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent |- | Llandovery | Church Bank Playing Fields | style=\"text-align:left;\" |3,000 | Llandovery, Carmarthenshire |- | Llanelli | Parc y Scarlets | style=\"text-align:left;\" |14,870 | Llanelli, Carmarthenshire |- | Merthyr | The Wern | style=\"text- align:left;\" |4,500 | Merthyr Tydfil |- | Neath | The Gnoll | style=\"text- align:left;\" |6,000 | Neath, Neath Port Talbot |- | Newport | Rodney Parade | style=\"text-align:left;\" |11,676 | Newport |- | Pontypridd | Sardis Road | style=\"text-align:left;\" |7,861 | Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf |- | RGC 1404 | Eirias Stadium | style=\"text-align:left;\" |6,000 | Colwyn Bay, Conwy |- | Swansea | St Helen's | style=\"text-align:left;\" |4,500 | Swansea |} == Standings (Phase One) == == Phase Two == After 15 rounds, the table is split into a top 8 and bottom 8 and points are reset to zero.
