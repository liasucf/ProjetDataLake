Its subsidiaries provide services including real estate development and management, information and telecommunications, printing and packaging, logistics, and supply and trading. ==History== In 2005, Al Bayan Holding Group's Chairman Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Hammad signed a commercial advertising deal with Minister Iyad bin Amin Madani of the Ministry of Culture and Information. In 2012, Al Hammad was operating 20 companies in Saudi Arabia and in the Gulf Cooperation Council, including Aloula Geojit Company. In 2012, the administration of King Abdullah Al Saud officially granted Al Bayan Holding Group to organize the annual Al Jenadriyah festival in Riyadh. In 2013, the then-Governor of Riyadh, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, awarded Dr. Al Hammad for the excellent work done by DNGO Contracting Company, one of the entities of Al Bayan Holding Group, for implementing the project of strengthening of water resources in Riyadh. It became the first Saudi Arabian company to issue an Islamic bond in Malaysian ringgit. As part of the 1 billion Malaysian ringgit investment programme, Al Bayan kicked off the deal by pumping 200 million Malaysian ringgit. In 2014, Hilton Hotels & Resorts signed a deal with Al Bayan Holding Group's Dar Al Bayan Real Estate firm in order to launch a hotel in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. In 2014, Al Bayan Holding Group signed a $70 million syndicated Islamic term, financing a facility with a group of leading regional and international banks. In 2015, Al Hammad was appointed as the new Vice Chairman of Saudi Cooperative Societies Council on 22 November 2014 by Prince Saud bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud. However, the incumbency of Dr. Al Hammad's position is disputed after the 2017 crisis when Malaysia's RAM suspended Al Bayan Holding Group's ratings. In 2016, Spain's Telepizza signed off a franchisee deal with Al Bayan Holding Group in order to establish one of three Saudi Arabian branches in Riyadh. In March 2017, Malaysian RAM Rating Services of RAM Holdings Berhad, Kuala Lumpur suspended the rating of the RM1bil Sukuk Wakalah (2013/2023) issued by Al Bayan Holding Company following the group's failure to meet certain obligations under RAM's rating mandate. ==References== Category:Conglomerate companies of Saudi Arabia Category:Companies based in Riyadh Category:Saudi Arabian companies established in 1980 Category:Holding companies established in 1980 ",
