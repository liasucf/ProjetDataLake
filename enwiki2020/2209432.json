    "text": "The inelastic mean free path (IMFP) is an index of how far an electron on average travels through a solid before losing energy. Universal curve for the electron inelastic mean free path in elements based on equation (5) in. If a monochromatic primary beam of electrons is incident on a solid surface, the majority of incident electrons lose their energy because they interact strongly with matter, leading to plasmon excitation, electron-hole pair formation, and vibrational excitation.R. F. Egerton (1996) Electron energy- loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope (Second Edition, Plenum Press, NY) The intensity of the primary electrons, I_0, is damped as a function of the distance, d, into the solid. The intensity decay can be expressed as follows: : I(d) = I_0 \\ e^{-d \\ / \\lambda(E)} where \\textstyle I(d) is the intensity after the primary electron beam has traveled through the solid to a distance \\textstyle d. The parameter \\textstyle \\lambda(E), termed the inelastic mean free path (IMFP), is defined as the distance an electron beam can travel before its intensity decays to \\textstyle 1/e of its initial value. (Note that this is equation is closely related to the Beer-Lambert law.) The inelastic mean free path of electrons can roughly be described by a universal curve that is the same for all materials. ==See also== * Scattering theory * Beer-Lambert law ==References== Category:Atomic, molecular, and optical physics ",
