He led an extravagant lifestyle, which the two continued together, and was discharged in bankruptcy in 1896. One journal wrote: \"Pecuniary troubles, however, embarrassed the two but slightly. A future Duke and Duchess can always beg or borrow, and they did. In 1900 they made a tour of the world, and on their way home fell in with Captain [Putnam] Bradlee Strong,Strong was the son of New York City Mayor William Lafayette Strong (1895\u20131897) at that time one of the handsomest and most popular men in the United States Army, and a special favorite with President McKinley.
