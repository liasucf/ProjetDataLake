    "text": "J\u00f6rg Hermann Fritz (born May 27, 1965, in Bruck an der Leitha, Austria) is a Canadian immunologist at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. He is known for his work in studying the role of allergen detection and tissue-disruptive signals in orchestrating early innate immune responses that result in the development of type 2 immune responses. Specifically, he is interested in the dysregulation of these responses that result in asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Fritz has done research is various topics in immunology, but his favourite work was with the development of vaccine adjuvants which he worked on during his MSc and PhD. == Early life and educationInterview with Dr. J\u00f6rg H. Fritz on March 18, 2019 == Born and raised in Bruck an der Leitha, Austria in 1965, Fritz chose to attend a biochemistry high school in Vienna, Austria after becoming fascinated by the natural sciences presented in an Austrian television show Universum at the age of 10. He began his undergraduate studies at the University of Vienna, studying microbiology and genetics. At the age of 19, Fritz lost his father to cancer, which influenced him to further his studies to understand cancer and why the human body has troubles fending off the disease. After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1999, he continued as a graduate student at the University of Vienna, in cooperation with Intercell AG (now Valneva) under the supervision of Drs. Alexander von Gabain and Max L. Birnstiel. Fritz's graduate work primarily focused on the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant IC31 and defended his thesis on \"The effects of antimicrobial peptides on the immune system\". He received his Master of Science degree in December 2000 and Doctor of Philosophy degree in September 2004. == Academic career == Fritz began his career in immunology as he believes the immune system is a perfect intersection of prokaryotes and eukaryotes since one can gather information about both worlds while taking evolution into account. This is important to Fritz as he is of Austrian heritage, and model of science research in Austria is heavily tied to the theory of evolution. Fritz's goal with his research is to increase humankind's knowledge of how the immune system works and share the excitement for the beauty of our world through science. Although Fritz has been a scientist for over 10 years, he still finds it fascinating how nature has designed the immune system to have various functions and the endless ways one could design experiments to study the immune system. === Post-doctoral fellowships === Following his graduate studies, Fritz entered a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute Pasteur in 2004 under Dana Philpott to investigate how innate immune recognition of microbes by the Nod-like receptors, Nod1 and Nod2, instructs inflammatory and antigen-specific immune responses to fend off bacterial infections. They discovered that the detection of peptidoglycan, a bacterial cell wall polymer, by Nod1 and Nod2 is essential for mounting innate and adaptive immune responses to Salmonella and Helicobacter infections. In 2006, Philpott was offered a Faculty position at the University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada and Fritz made the decision to move to Toronto to continue his post-doctoral fellowship. In 2007, Fritz pursued a second post-doctoral fellowship under Dr. Jennifer L. Gommerman at the University of Toronto. There, he studied how immunoglobulin A (IgA) in plasma cells regulate the intestinal B cell response. IgA released by plasma cells is important for maintaining a first-line of defense against food-borne pathogens and toxins in the gut. Fritz discovered that tumor necrosis factor alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase are required for IgA plasma cell homeostasis during healthy and infection conditions. From these results, he suggests that plasma cells should be re-examined for their roles in inflammation and infection. === Research focus and findings === In 2010, Fritz was offered a Faculty position at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, and has established his research laboratory there. During the early years of his laboratory, he continued investigating how innate immune recognition of microbes through Nod1 and Nod2 dictates innate and adaptive immune responses. He later shifted interests towards studying how allergen detection and tissue-disruptive signals can result in early innate immune responses that may be deregulated and lead to the onset of detrimental type 2 immune responses that cause asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells are central in the processes mentioned and his laboratory is currently studying the molecular underpinnings of these cells. Working with Dr. Salman Qureshi, it has been determined that Cryptococcus neoformas infections are positively correlated with the induction of interleukin-33 in the lung, which results in the increase of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and elevated type 2 immune responses that further contributes to fungal pathogenesis induced. Current research goals of his laboratory is to identify (1) cellular and molecular requirements of interleukin-33-mediated group 2 innate lymphoid cell activation, (2) how interferons regulate group 1 and 2 innate lymphoid cell functions, and (3) mechanisms of cytokine trafficking in group 2 innate lymphoid cells. == Fellowships and awards == * 2012, Research Achievement Award for research publication with the highest impact factor, McGill University * 2008\u20132010, Career development fellowship of the Austrian Programme for Advanced Research and Technology (APART), Academy of Sciences Austria * 2006\u20132007, Erwin Schrodinger Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, Austrian Research Fund * 2005\u20132006, Programme Transversal de Recherche, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, Institute Pasteur * 2004\u20132005, Association Francois Aupetit, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship == Editorships == * Academic editor, PLOS ONE, 2010-present * Ad hoc editor, Frontiers in Immunology, Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Science Signalling, Nature Immunology, Science Immunology, 2018 == Most significant contributions == * Schellack C., Prinz K., Egyed A., Fritz J.H., Wittmann B., Ginzler M, Swatosch G., Zauner W., Kast C., Akira S., von Gabain A., Buschle M., Schmidt W., Lingnau K. \"IC31, a novel adjuvant signaling via TLR9, induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses\".
