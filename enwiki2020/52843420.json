It was designed to look worn down and like the former Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, with the design handled by now- defunct Japanese design company Hoshino-Gumi, with props imported directly from Hong Kong. It was located a ten-minute walk from Kawasaki station. The facility featured retro games in addition to modern ones, and was also a common locale for both amateur and professional photo and video shoots, such as music videos for idol group Keyakizaka46 song \"Gomen ne Christmas\" and music group Wednesday Campanella song \"Ikkyu-san\" The facility closed on 17 November 2019, with some sources reporting that it was due to a dispute over rent with the landlord, and that there are currently no plans for a reopening at another venue. == References == == Further reading == * * * == External links == *Anata no Warehouse official website Category:Buildings and structures in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Category:Amusement arcades Category:Video arcades ",
