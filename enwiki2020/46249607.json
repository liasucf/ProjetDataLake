    "text": "Bhrama (Sanskrit: \u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e), in the context of Hindu thought, means \u2013 error, mistake, illusion, confusion, perplexity. But, it literally means \u2013 that which is not steady; and refers to error etc., caused by defects in the perceptive system. The seeing of snake in a rope in darkness, silver nacre in moonlight, water in a mirage on a hot day and a person in a stump of tree are four classic instances quoted in Vedantic texts. Bhrama is a mistake, it is a confusion about one object which exists for another object which does not exist, it merely refers to the fallibility of human perception. Human nature is ordinarily afflicted by - \u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0932\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0915\u0930\u0923\u093e\u092a\u093e\u091f\u0935\u0926\u094b\u0937\u093e\u0903 \u2013 i.e. bhrama (false knowledge or mistakes), pram\u0101da (inattention or misunderstanding reality), vipralips\u0101 (cheating propensity) and kara\u1e47a-a-p\u0101\u1e6dava (imperfection of the senses) are four major mind-faults which mislead human beings and do not permit right perception and cognition. Amongst these, the knowledge which is of the nature of bhrama is the direct thought-wave of avidya. And, the texts speak about there being five theories of illusion or erroneous perception \u2013 \u0100tmakhy\u0101ti (Yogacara theory of subjective apprehension), Asatkhy\u0101ti (Madhyamaka theory of the nonexistent), Akhy\u0101ti (Prabh\u0101kara\u2019s theory of non-apprehension), Anyath\u0101khyati (Nyaya theory of misapprehension) and Anirvacan\u012byakhy\u0101ti (Advaita Vedanta theory of apprehension of the indeterminate), developed by five schools of thought. The Vedantic texts reveal the Self as Pure Consciousness; they reveal the Self as the ever blissful witness who is neither the enjoyer nor the enjoyment or the object of enjoyment. The enjoyer is Chidabhasa or Jiva, the sheath of the intellect, a product or manifestation of Maya, not transcendentally real and subject to change. Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (VII.9-10) explains:- : \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0936\u092e\u0935\u0932\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0924\u0947 | : \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0924\u0926\u093e\u093d\u0939\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u0940\u0935\u094b\u093d\u092d\u093f\u092e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 || : \"When Jiva, having the immutable Kutastha as his basis, wrongly identifies himself with the gross and subtle bodies, he comes to think of himself as bound by the pleasures and pains of this world.\" : \u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0936\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0924\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0926\u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0928\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u0924\u093e | : \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0924\u0926\u093e \u091a\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0938\u0919\u094d\u0917\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0924\u093f \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u092f\u0924\u0947 || : \"When Jiva gives up his attachment to his illusory portion, the nature of the substratum becomes predominant and he realizes that he is associationless and of the nature of pure consciousness.\" Swami Swahananda in his commentary tells us that Kutastha, conventionally identified with ego, is not the object of identification for it is incapable of being associated with ego. According to Shankara, atma-anatma adhyasa, the so-called locus of superimposition, is a mispresentation or proksha-aproksha bhrama. Panchapadika pf Padmapada interprets purovasthitava (the object in front) as contact with the visual sense, whereas Ratnaprabha of Ni\u015bcalakara relates it with sense-contact; the former explains that a non-object can become an apparent object and the latter explains that Shankara in no way considers the said locus to be complete and conclusive. Saguna (with attributes) worship leads to a typical illusion in as much as the devotee mistakes physical or mental images for the formless God; it is of the nature of the Samvadi-bhrama that finally leads to the realization of Nirguna Brahman, the endless pursuit after sense-objects is the Visamvadi-bhrama. But, the cumulative subtle awareness of bhrama need not necessarily result in the awareness of Maya because owing to the latter either one wakes up from a dream or goes on dreaming forever. Svar\u016bpa-bhrama (illusion about spirituality) is one the four major anarthas (useless, meaningless, disastrous, wrongdoings) and is said to be of four kinds \u2013 sva- tattva which is illusion about one\u2019s own spiritual identity, para-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual identity of the supreme absolute truth, s\u0101dhya-s\u0101dhana-tattva which is illusion about the spiritual means and the object gained, and m\u0101y\u0101-tattva which is illusion about the Lord\u2019s external energy. These anarthas are required to be uprooted in order to develop ni\u015b\u1e6da (devotion). But, bhrama is not an \u0101ropa (imposing of, imputation, figurative substitution) which is an \u0101h\u0101rya (wilfully caused in spite of falsity) cognition. The Yoga School of thought adopts the Anyath\u0101khyati theory of misapprehension of the Nyayas for dealing with bhrama, which theory is based on the premise that bhrama is thinking of something as that which it is not, like attributing the characteristics of Prakrti to Purusha and vice versa. In Ayurveda, bhrama refers to Vertigo, a discreet disease due to Vata prakopa and Pitta prakopa which shows six distinct stages, and is curable. ==References== Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Vedanta Category:Sanskrit words and phrases Category: Yoga concepts Category:Adi Shankara ",
