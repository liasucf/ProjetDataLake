    "text": "The Philosophy Gym: 25 Short Adventures in Thinking is a book by Stephen Law. It is an introduction to philosophical thinking aimed at adults. It covers twenty-five philosophical questions, chosen for their relevance to today's society. The book aims for accessibility. This is often done, as in \"What's wrong with gay sex?\", by putting the question into a theatrical script. The German version of The Philosophy Gym won the first Mindelheim Philosophy Prize in 2009. ==Chapter list== # Where did the universe come from? # What is wrong with gay sex? # Brain \u2013 snatched (discussion of metaphysical issues of knowledge of the external world, and D\u00e9scartes' 'Cogito Ergo Sum' (I think therefore I am)) # Is time travel possible? # Into the lair of the relativist (a look at and analysis of relativist claims, mainly ethical relativity) # Could a machine think? # Does God exist? # The strange case of the rational dentist (a look at specific knowledge of other minds and the extent to which we may have knowledge of them) # But is it art? # Can we have morality without God and religion? # Is creationism scientific? # Designer babies...
