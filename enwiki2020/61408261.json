    "text": "Georges Blun (1 June 1893 \u2013 1999) was a French journalist and intelligence agent who was the Berlin correspondent of the Journal de Paris. == Early life, World War I and the interwar years == Georges Blun was born to a French family on 1 June 1893 in the then German-held region of Alsace-Lorraine. He was married to a fellow journalist. He worked for the British MI5, as well as French intelligence during World War I. In 1920 he was expelled from Switzerland for conducting \"clandestine activities\" and communist agitation. By 1925, he had grown close to the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From 1925 to 1930 he worked in the Weimar Republic as a correspondent for various newspapers, such as Journal des d\u00e9bats. In 1928, it was reported that following publication of a controversial ('distorted') article on the Silvesternacht (New Year's Eve) in Berlin in a Paris paper, he resigned his chairmanship of the Association of Foreign Press and made an apology visit to the government press department. He returned to Switzerland in 1939 after having worked as a journalist in Berlin for a considerable amount of time. == World War II == left During World War II, he became a resistance fighter against Nazi Germany in the service of the Red Orchestra. Under the pseudonym \"Long\" he was the head of the eponymous George Blun group in Switzerland. This group formed part of the Red Three, led by Alexander Rad\u00f3.The Ultimate Spy Book (Dorling Kindersley Ltd., London), The world of intelligence, H. Keith Melton, Oleg Kalugin, and William Colby ; Section: \"The Red Orchestra\u201c \u2026 George Blun Group. During the war, he spied primarily and most notably in service of the Soviet Union, but also worked for American, British, French, Swiss and Polish intelligence agencies as well - a fact described by at least one source covering the events as \"common\" among Switzerland-based spies at the time. His loyalties were described by Nigel West as \"always prioritizing\" the Communist International and the GRU, while the CIA assesses his group as having an \"ambiguous\" ideology. During his clandestine activities, he worked with figures such as Hans Bernd Gisevius, 20 July plot members, as well as Joseph Wirth, the latter of which had served as Chancellor of Germany. Blun's group was viewed by the Soviets as the second most valuable, after the group led by Rachel D\u00fcbendorfer. == Post-War life == Blun survived the war, following which, along with Otto John and several others, reportedely became a member of a political group led by Josef M\u00fcller. The group advocated for a united and neutralist Germany with a pro-USSR alignment. He was still working as a journalist by May 11, 1950, when he penned an article in the French Le Monde newspaper regarding the division of Berlin and was cited for his work covering the division of the country. He passed away in 1999. ==Publications== *L'Allemagne mise a nu (La nouvelle Soc. d'Edition, Paris,. 1927, 183 p.)
