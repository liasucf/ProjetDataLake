Registered in April 1998, its total assets were worth over \u20b18.5 billion (US$197 million) in 2008. 120 (20 percent) of DLSU faculty had been involved in 80 research projects between March 2008 and February 2009. 39 (12 percent) of its faculty had their research published in ISI-listed journals in 2008. Since 2000, DLSU has been the Commission on Higher Education Zonal Research Center for the 59 colleges and universities located in Las Pi\u00f1as, Makati, Manila, Muntinlupa, Para\u00f1aque, Pasay, Pasig, Pateros, Taguig and San Juan. Its functions include evaluation of research proposals for recommendation for CHED funding and monitoring of CHED-funded researches, among others. The College of Computer Studies Center for Empathic Human- Computer Interactions specializes in affective computing, a study that seeks to create machines capable of reacting to human emotions. The center is funded by the Philippine Department of Science and Technology. Emotion recognition (including laughter recognition), behavior prediction and the influence of music to emotion are among the center's research, many of which are in collaboration with Osaka University. The center, also in collaboration with Osaka, is the first one that constructed an empathic computing space in the Philippines. The Center for Micro-Hydro Technology for Rural Electrification of the College of Engineering, established in 2002 through Japan International Cooperation Agency funds, is engaged in designing micro hydro generators. The center, in coordination with the Philippine Department of Energy, has been involved in the electrification of remote areas using micro hydro installations. SINAG, the first Philippine solar car Both of the only two solar cars, SINAG (Tagalog for light beam) and SIKAT (brilliance), of the Philippines were made by DLSU engineering faculty and students. SINAG participated in the 2007 World Solar Challenge, and finished 12th among 40 entries. SIKAT (which has more advanced solar cells, a more aerodynamic body, and 100 kg less weight) will participate in the 2011 competition. The project is funded by several private companies, including Ford Philippines, Pilipinas Shell, Philippine Airlines and San Miguel Corporation. The College of Engineering is among the 18 \"National Research Institutions\" of the Asian Regional Research Programme on Environmental Technology, a project funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and coordinated by the Asian Institute of Technology that seeks to assess environmental degradation in Asia. The college has also conducted research on biodiesel from the pili nut and winged bean, and sustainable technology. In 2020, De La Salle University captured the attention of British diplomats and scientists with its research on converting wastewater or toilet sludge into nutrient-rich fertilizer. The study aims to find a sustainable alternative to importing phosphates as fertilizer for farms in the Philippines. The research project won \u20b113 million from the Newton Fund of the U.K. government. The University's I-Nano facility has initiated a project on developing a Thermal Mechanical Garment (outer layer of a space suit) made from Abaca fiber. This is officially funded by the DOST and to be collaborated alongside the Technological University of the Philippines, FEATI University, Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, and the Philippine Textile Research Institute. The study aims to fabricate a layered structure of fabric out of Abaca fibers coated by a nanocomposite material for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal resistance. ==Student life== Br. Connon Hall, location of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs As of 2010, the Council of Student Organizations, a union of DLSU-accredited student organizations, had 39 members. Founded in 1974, the council oversees implementation of university- wide activities, such as annual freshmen welcoming. The LaSallian (first published in 1960) and Ang Pahayagang Plaridel (Tagalog for The Plaridel Newspaper; first published in 1984) are the official student newspapers of the university. The two, written in English and Filipino respectively, are among the four periodicals managed by the Student Media Office. Other student media groups managed by the Student Media Office include the Malate Literary Portfolio, Green & White, Green Giant FM, and Archers Network. left ===Performing arts=== The De La Salle University Chorale is \"the premiere chorale group in the university.\" Since its establishment in 1987, it has won several awards from different international choir competitions, including the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in 1992 and 2010 for the chamber and folk music, and the grand prize in the Tampere Vocal Music Festival in 1995, among others. The La Salle Dance Company \u2013 Street is the first champion of the UAAP Street Dance Competition, an annual event organized by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines since it was first introduced in the second semester of UAAP Season 73 in 2011. They have won the most number of titles in the seniors' division of the UAAP Street Dance Competition with four championships. They also represent the country as frequent finalists in the World Hip Hop Dance Championships. Other groups in the company specialize in contemporary and folk. Established around 1966, the Harlequin Theatre Guild is the official theater organization of DLSU. It has performed plays written by Palanca Awards laureates, including Unang Ulan ng Mayo (Tagalog for First Rainfall of May) by John Iremil Teodoro, which was staged for the fourth time in December 2011 in line with the LGBT month of Metro Manila and Rizal is My President: 40 Leadership Tips from Jose Rizal by Joshua So based on the book written by Napoleon G. Almonte and staged during the May 2009 Presidential Elections. Other notable organizations include the De La Salle Innersoul, Green Media Group, and Lasallian Youth Orchestra. ===Sports tradition=== Green Archer Statue The De La Salle Green Archers in 2010 De La Salle has several varsity teams and sport clubs participating in different sports competitions, most notably basketball, volleyball, football and cheerleading. The university was a founding member in 1924 of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), in which it won five General Championships (1972\u201373, 1974\u201375, 1976\u201377, 1977\u201378, and 1980\u201381) until La Salle withdrew from the league in 1981. Br. John Lynam FSC, established the first De La Salle basketball team. In 1924, he was one of the organizers of the pre-war National Collegiate Athletic Association as the first and oldest collegiate athletic association in the Philippines composed of De La Salle, San Beda, Ateneo, Letran, UP, UST, FEU, NU and UM. In 1986, De La Salle University was admitted into the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), an intercollegiate sporting association formed in 1938. Ever since joining the UAAP in 1986, DLSU has won three UAAP General Championships \u2013 Season 75 (2012\u201313), Season 76 (2013\u201314), and Season 78 (2015\u201316), giving the university a combined eight General Championship titles in the seniors' division in the NCAA and UAAP. The DLSU Animo Squad was originally known in its pre-war NCAA years as Br. John Lynam's 1924 LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, then in 1926 as the LSC Yell Commanders. The DLSC Squad was the first and oldest Collegiate Coed Spirit Team in the Philippines. It was renamed decades later on as the post- war DLSC Cheerleading Squad, then in the 1980s as the DLSU Pep Squad until 2008, when it was renamed by Br. Bernard Oca FSC, as the present DLSU Animo Squad. The DLSU Green & White Spirit Team has since then won five cheer dance podium finishes in the span of its UAAP participation, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2011 and 2013. The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924 to 1926 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernard Oca's present DLSU Animo Squad has been continuously cheerleading for years. The first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from St. Scholastica's College, Manila before De La Salle College turned co-educational in 1973. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more. In 1941, the DLSC Green & White yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP. ==Partner institution== ===Malaysia=== *Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman ==Notable alumni== Jaime Sin Notable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include: *Jose Diokno \u2013 Politician *Lorenzo Tanada \u2013 Politician *Salvador H.
