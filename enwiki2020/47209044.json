The Story of Modern Applied Art, New York, 1948 and more recently.Hagenauer Fakes Karl Hagenauer's work found an avid American market partly through the efforts of New York gallery owner Rena Rosenthal, who featured the Josephine Baker sculpture in a 1935 window display. He made two voyages to New York to visit her in the 1930sLiberty Ellis Foundation and stamped some of the merchandise retailed through her store with a custom \"RENA\" mark in addition to his trademark \"wHw.\" Rosenthal's patronage was critical to the post-war success of the Werkst\u00e4tte Hagenauer; the hostilities caused a delay of several years in her payment for a last container of products shipped in 1938, and the subsequent change in exchange rate was very advantageous to the Austrian firm, supporting rebuilding efforts.Kronsteiner, Olga.

Franz Hagenauer also studied from an early age with Franz Ci\u017eek at Vienna's School of Applied Arts, and joined the family business at age twenty.

Franz took over the running of the company after Karl died in 1956. == Apprentices and associates == Julius Jirasek (1896 - 1965) was an Austrian architect who trained under Oskar Strnad and Josef Frank at the Vienna School of Applied Arts.
