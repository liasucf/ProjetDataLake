Samil 20,50 and 100 trucks transport soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. Samil trucks are all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain. Motorised infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy. == Leadership == ==Notes== == References == Category:Infantry battalions of South Africa Category:Infantry regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1994 Category:United Nations Force Intervention Brigade ",
