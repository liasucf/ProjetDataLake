    "text": "Surgically facilitated orthodontic therapy (SFOT) is a group of dental procedures and can be broadly divided into 2 main categories ==Types== The rather less invasive type that uses alveolar corticotomies and is aimed at augmenting the alveolar bone deficiencies and shortening the orthodontic treatment time. Various procedures have been introduced, but mainly involves creating corticotomies in the alveolar bone, creating a Regional Acceleratory Phenomenon (RAP), leading to increased bone turnover, decreased mineral content of the alveolar bone, and this collectively leads to faster tooth movement and bone remodeling. As the technique evolved, periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO), to correct the deficient alveolar bone (dehiscences and fenestrations) that are often associated with gingival recessions, simultaneous bone augmentation with particulate bone graft (allgraft/xenograft) and collagen membrane were also added to the original corticotomies. Various flap design modifications have been suggested,including the full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap reflection or the VISTA approach. The second category uses the principles of Osteodistraction and osteotomies to facilitate correction of often severe malocclusions, such as rapid maxillary expansion to correct a narrow maxilla or closure of large clefts in cleft palate patients. ==References== Category:Dentistry procedures Category:Periodontology Category:Orthodontics ",
