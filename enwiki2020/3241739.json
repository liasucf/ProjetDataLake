    "text": "Offenbacher Kickers, also known as Kickers Offenbach, is a German association football club in Offenbach am Main, Hesse. The club was founded on 27 May 1901 in the Rheinischer Hof restaurant by footballers who had left established local clubs including Melitia, Teutonia, Viktoria, Germania and Neptun. From 1921 to 1925 they were united with VfB 1900 Offenbach as VfR Kickers Offenbach until resuming their status as a separate side, Offenbacher FC Kickers.Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Since 2012, Kickers Offenbach's stadium has been the Sparda Bank Hessen Stadium. ==History== The club became one of the founding members of the Nordkreis-Liga in 1909, where it played until the outbreak of the war. In post-First World War Germany, Kickers played in the Kreisliga S\u00fcdmain (I), winning this league in 1920, 1922 and 1923. The club played as a mid-table side in the Bezirksliga Main-Hessen through the late 1920s and early 1930s. German football was re-organized in 1933 under the Third Reich into sixteen first division Gauligen. Kickers joined the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest, where the team immediately captured the title and entered the national playoffs for the first time. They fared poorly there, but did manage to raise their overall level of play in the following seasons, going on to win five consecutive divisional championships from 1940 to 1944.Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag In the early 1940s the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest had been split into the Gauliga Westmark and the Gauliga Hessen-Nassau, where Kickers played. Their best post-season result came in 1942 when the team was able to advance as far as the semi-finals in the national championship rounds before they were decisively put out 0:6 by Schalke 04, who were on their way to their sixth championship as the era's most dominant side. By 1944, Allied armies were rolling through Germany and the Gauliga Hessen-Nassau did not play the 1944\u201345 season.

The team was immediately relegated, but returned to the upper league for play in 1970\u201371. In addition to their return to the Bundesliga, the club would win one of its few honours in 1970 with a 2:1 German Cup victory over 1. FC K\u00f6ln. However, the end of the 1971 season would find Kickers Offenbach at the centre of the Bundesliga scandal. The club president, Horst-Gregorio Canellas, went to the German Football Association (Deutsche Fussball Bund or German Football Association) after being approached by a player from another team looking for a cash bonus for that club's effort in beating one of Offenbach's rivals in the fight against relegation. Receiving no help from league officials, Canellas began gathering evidence of how widespread the payoffs were. In the end more than fifty players from seven clubs, two coaches, and six game officials were found guilty of trying to influence the outcome of games through bribes, but Canellas was unable to save his club from relegation. The club central to the scandal \u2013 Arminia Bielefeld \u2013 would not be punished until the following season, too late to save Offenbach.Ulrich Hesse- Lichtenberger (2002). Tor! The Story of German Football. WSC Books The scandal had a negative effect on the young league and contributed to plummeting attendance figures. One outcome of the whole affair was the further evolution of German football; salary restrictions were removed and the 2. Bundesliga also became a professional league. Kickers immediately returned to the top level. The best finish was 7th in the 1972\u201373 season. They were leaders for 5 rounds and beat Bayern Munich 6\u20130 in the 1974\u201375 season but were relegated to the second level in the 1975\u201376 season. ===Decline and recovery=== Kickers spent the next seven years in the 2. Bundesliga before making a return to the Bundesliga for just a single season in 1983\u201384. In 1985, financial problems led to the club being penalized points and driven into the third division amateur Oberliga Hessen. They recovered, only to be denied a licence in 1989, and were sent back down again. By the mid-1990s they again slipped into the Oberliga Hessen (IV). They appeared in the final of the national amateur championship in 1994 where they lost 1\u20130 to Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. Offenbach returned the 2. Bundesliga in 1999 and were immediately relegated after a 17th-place finish. In each of these seasons the team took part in the nation amateur championship, winning the title in 1999. The club next appeared in the 2. Bundesliga in 2005. After two lower table finishes, Kickers were relegated to the 3. Liga on the final day of the 2007\u201308 season following a 3\u20130 defeat to fellow strugglers VfL Osnabr\u00fcck. On 18 July 2012, the club's new ground, the Sparda Bank Hessen Stadium, was opened with a pre-season friendly against Bayer Leverkusen. The club was refused a 3. Liga licence at the end of the 2012\u201313 season and was relegated to the Regionalliga, with SV Darmstadt 98 taking its place. The club, \u20ac9 million in debt, could have faced insolvency and a restart at the lowest level of the German football league system.Ruhl: \"Ein bitterer Tag f\u00fcr den OFC\" kicker.de, published: 3 June 2013, accessed: 4 June 2013 The club won the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in 2014\u201315 and earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the 3. Liga, where they missed out on promotion to Magdeburg. The loss was overshadowed by approximately 40 Offenbach supporters storming the field in the 84th minute and forcing a twenty-minute interruption to the return leg.3\\.
