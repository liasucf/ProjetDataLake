    "text": "250px Centerm is short for Centennial Terminals, a major dock in Vancouver's East Side. With the conversion to containerization and modular transport, the open pallet transport of goods that had prevailed on the waterfront was over. As such larger, newer facilities were needed by the late 1960s. With the shipping rules changed in 1968, container cranes and flat wharf space became paramount. ==Construction== The old finger piers of the east end, piers such as Evans Coleman Evans; and Lapointe, which had been in Vancouver since its incorporation, gave way. Building rubble was dumped on the foreshore at Main Street and a peninsula where the Hastings Mill once sat and a massive terminal was created at the behest of Barney Johnson with Federal money in 1958, hence the Centennial Year and name (BC's 100's birthday). ==Equipment== Container cranes, and heavy lift gear were installed. Room for two large freighters was created, both in terms of length and draught. Over the years, the cranes have been expanded, the latter set was built in China, and quadruple stack containering allowed. ==Rail links== The facility is served by both Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway. ==References== Category:Container terminals Category:Ports and harbours of British Columbia Category:Buildings and structures in Vancouver ",
