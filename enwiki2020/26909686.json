    "text": "Swinger is the sixth album by the Spanish group Barrab\u00e1s, released in 1976. It was the last album before the group's four-year hiatus, and the last to feature several band members including Ricky Morales, Juan Vidal and Daniel Louis. Due to the album title being absent from the cover, it is sometimes known simply as Barrab\u00e1s. The album was later re-released on CD as Watch-Out with a similar sleeve, but is not related to the other Barrab\u00e1s album of that name, the 1975 release, Watch Out. \"Swinger\" / \"Week End\" was released as a single. ==Track listing== #\"Swinger\" (Fernando Arbex) \u2013 4:55 #\"Movi'on\" (Ernesto Duarte) \u2013 4:30 #\"Turn Me Love\" (Enrique Morales) \u2013 4:48 #\"Oldie\" (Duarte, E.
