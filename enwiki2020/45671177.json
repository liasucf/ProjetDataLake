    "text": "Les gazelles is a 2014 French comedy film directed by Mona Achache. ==Plot== Marie and Eric, a couple in their thirties who have been together since college, buy their first apartment when Marie is suddenly overcome by doubt. Her encounter with a handsome, dark-haired man forces her to make a decision: she leaves Eric to throw herself into the big sea of pleasure and freedom. But she actually ends up on the bottom of the pool, where she discovers a world without pity: at her age, being single is quickly perceived as a suspicious defect. Enlightened by new friendships, Marie learns to envisage her single life as a chance to become even stronger and to at last be ready to be happy. ==Cast== * Camille Chamoux as Marie * Audrey Fleurot as Sandra * Jos\u00e9phine de Meaux as Judith * Naidra Ayadi as Myriam * Anne Brochet as Gwen * Olivia C\u00f4te as V\u00e9ro * Franck Gastambide as Eric * Samuel Benchetrit as Martin * Camille Cottin as Emilie * Josiane Balasko as Brigitte * Sam Karmann as Jacques * Rachel Arditi as Virginie * Gr\u00e9goire Ludig as Marco * David Marsais as Olivier * St\u00e9phane De Groodt as M.
