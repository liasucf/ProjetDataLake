This latest is more subdued, a selection of sometimes brooding but occasionally sublime ruminations, culled from live performances around the world in 2014, amounting to an unintended suite many Romantic-era classical composers would have been happy to have written.\" John Fordham of The Guardian wrote: \"In its pensive melodies and post-Romantic chord voicings, Creation is a very different proposition to the jubilant Rio. It comprises selections from six different 2014 concert performances in four cities, reordered to make a nine-part suite that sounds like a free-flowing single work. Some sections unfold as treble ripples turning to ballad-like songs, while glimpses of gospel chord-changes surface and then evaporate, and rolling, low-register ostinatos gently modulate. It's dark, and sometimes melancholy, but as usual with Jarrett, full of improvised motifs that suggest long-forgotten songs. ECM are simultaneously releasing a set of Jarrett's classical interpretations of music by Samuel Barber and Bart\u00f3k\". Jazz critic Ivan Hewett of The Telegraph focuses his analysis on Jarrett's apparent declining career, the lack of blues, jazz changes and the absence of virtuoso finger-work: ==Track listing== #Part I \u2013 Live at Roy Thomson Hall, Toronto - 8:17 #Part II \u2013 Live at Kioi Hall, Tokyo - 7:40 #Part III \u2013 Live at Salle Pleyel, Paris - 6:59 #Part IV \u2013 Live at Auditorium Parco della Musica, Rome - 7:33 #Part V \u2013 Live at Kioi Hall, Tokyo - 7:13 #Part VI \u2013 Live at Orchard Hall, Tokyo - 9:25 #Part VII \u2013 Live at Auditorium Parco della Musica, Rome - 8:17 #Part VIII \u2013 Live at Auditorium Parco della Musica, Rome - 8:36 #Part IX \u2013 Live at Orchard Hall, Tokyo - 8:30 :Music by Keith Jarrett == Personnel == Keith Jarrett - Piano, Production == Technical Personnel == * Martin Pearson - Recording Engineer * Ryu Kawashima - Recording Engineer (Tokyo) * Christoph Stickel - Mastering * Eberhard Ross - Cover Painting * Sascha Kleis - Design * Manfred Eicher - Mastering, Executive producer ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2014) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} == References == Category:Keith Jarrett albums Category:2015 live albums Category:Live instrumental albums Category:ECM Records live albums Category:Solo piano jazz albums ",
