    "text": "Directions is a compilation album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released in 1981 by Columbia Records. It collects previously unreleased outtakes that Davis recorded between 1960 and 1970. Directions was the last of a series of compilation albums - mostly consisting of, at that time, previously unreleased music - that Columbia released to bridge Davis' recording hiatus that ended with The Man with the Horn in July 1981. == Music == Directions is a double album that features previously unreleased outtakes recorded over a 10-year period by Davis. Apart from \"Song of Our Country\" from the recording sessions for Sketches of Spain (1960), a 1961 recording of \"'Round Midnight\", and \"So Near, So Far\" from 1963, the album's songs are from Davis' transitional period during 1967 to 1970, when he was experimenting with a fusion of jazz and rock. They feature sidemen such as saxophonist Wayne Shorter, guitarist John McLaughlin, and keyboardists Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, and Chick Corea. == Critical reception == Reviewing in Allmusic, critic Scott Yanow believed some of the tracks \"rambled on a bit too long\" but the music was nonetheless \"mostly quite fascinating\" and \"highly recommendable to collectors with an open ear toward fusion.\" ==Track listing== All tracks by Miles Davis except where noted. ==Personnel== \"Song of Our Country\", recorded in New York, March 11, 1960.
