They are deadly to all living creatures. They are extremely resilient, resistant to high temperatures, do not need shelter and are able to survive an apocalypse without taking cover. Dalphins in this novel resemble real dolphins. They have evolved to survive an apocalypse in the following way: females lay eggs once every twenty years, right before the apocalypse. Critical changes in the environment, and sometimes just the warning signs, stimulate development of the larvae. The creatures migrate back to the ocean when seismic activity is over. The next stage of their development is the cocoon. A Dalphin spends one to two months inside the cocoon before emerging as an adult. In the world of this book, mentioning of the glaives is a taboo, probably from the fear of them. The word glaive means an edged weapon that was used in the medieval times. * \"The Yellowmore\" () (from the book Bastard) is a wizard's trap. It looks like an old man carved out of a tree. This old man smokes a pipe that emits yellow smoke. Smoke kills living things, by homing on the body heat. * \"The Devourer\" () (from the book Bastard) is a wizard's trap. It is a hole in the ground that attracts its victims with a children's cry for help. Approaching victim gets sucked in by a whirlwind. * \"Calidons\" () (from the book The Ritual) are gigantic white birds, which live near the dragons. They pluck their own soft white feathers in order to hatch their chicks. * \"Mryga\" () (from the book Armaggedon-Home) is an apocalypse, that comes periodically, approximately every twenty years. During this period \"The gates\" are formed: objects of the unknown nature, that look like a stone arch with a mirror inside. People who enter the mirror are safe from the apocalypse and are able to return after it is over. \"Minor gates\" are formed as well, these are used by the animals and can not be employed by humans. There are enough gates formed, so every person has an opportunity to be saved if he/she enters the nearest one. These gates are transmitting some kind of signal, but humans were not able to determine what it is. * \"Nav\", \"Navka\", \"Nyavka\" () (from the book Age of the Witch) is a magic creature that takes its form after a person who has recently died. It is brought to life if someone loved that dead person and wished for him/her to come back. Nav is using deception to kill a person who brought it to life. Nav, as well as Chugaister, are taken from Ukrainian mythology, but differ from the source material in many ways. For example: in the classic Ukrainian novel The Forest Song () by Lesya Ukrainka, the main characte is a Navka, a spirit of the forest or sprite. * \"Chugaister\" () (from the book Age of the Witch, probably taken from a book \"The Forest Song\" by Lesya Ukrainka ) are magical creatures that are very similar to the human. Chugaisters, sometimes by themselves, sometimes in a group, destroy Navs (see above), by dancing around them. By doing so they make Navs to dance with them until they collapse dead. Chugaister was taken from the Ukrainian mythology, but is somewhat different from the original creature. * \"Elfoush\" () (from the book The Well Master) is a little flying somewhat intelligent creature, which resembles an elf. Little children and people who are in love can understand what elfoushes say, thus becoming their prey. * \"Housekeeper\" () (from the book The Well Master) is a little house demon, looks like a little man with spider's legs. == Notes and references == ==References== * Writers' official international website * official website of the authors at www.rusf.ru * official website of the authors at www.fiction.ru * official website of the authors at sf.org.kemsu.ru * Bibliography * lib.ru Available books in the On- line Library of Moshkov * Vita Nostra on Amazon * The story behind the cover of Vita Nostra ==External links== * Marina and Sergey Dyachenko - biography * , Pawe\u0142 Lauda\u0144ski, Marina i Siergiej Diaczenko, Esensja, 9 July 2003 * , Pawe\u0142 Lauda\u0144ski, Wywiad z Marin\u0105 i Siergiejem Diaczenko, Esensja, 9 February 2005 Category:Ukrainian science fiction writers Category:Ukrainian fantasy writers Category:Ukrainian alternate history writers Category:Russian-language writers Category:Living people Category:Married couples Category:Women science fiction and fantasy writers Category:Russian women writers Category:Writing duos Category:Women historical novelists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
