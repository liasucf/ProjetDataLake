The satellite has a mass of and a planned operational lifespan of 15 years. The satellite carried 62 transponders: 24 operating in the C band of the electromagnetic spectrum, 36 in the Ku band and 2 in the L band. Khrunichev was contracted to launch Ekspress AM7, using a Proton-M/Briz-M rocket - the same configuration that had failed to deploy the similar Ekspress AM4 and Ekspress AM4R. The launch took place from Site 200/39 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, at 22:05 UTC on 18 March 2015. The satellite was deployed into the planned geostationary transfer orbit. ==See also== * Ekspress ==References== Category:Spacecraft launched in 2015 Category:Ekspress satellites Category:2015 in Russia Category:Satellites using the Eurostar bus ",
