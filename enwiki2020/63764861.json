    "text": "The Hotel Saranac is a historic hotel in Saranac Lake, New York, a town served by the Adirondack Railway. Its full name is Hotel Saranac, Curio Collection by Hilton. The hotel was designed by local architects William Scopes and Maurice Feustmann in an austere Colonial Revival (or Neo-Georgian) style and built in 1927. The hotel is a symmetrically-arranged, six-story building clad in brick veneer. In order to ensure fire safety, the hotel was built with steel framing and concrete floors. The large lobby on the second floor was modeled after the Grand Salon of the Davanzati Palace in Florence. The hotel closed in 2013, underwent a $35-million renovation, and reopened in 2018. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. It is a member of the Historic Hotels of America. It was asserted to have been the first fireproof hotel in the Adirondacks. It was owned and operated by Paul Smith's College from 1962 to 2006. It was used by the college for on-the-job training as part of its hotel, resort, and culinary management program. ==References== ==External links== *Hotel Saranac, official site Category:Colonial Revival architecture Category:National Register of Historic Places in Franklin County, New York Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1927 Category:Hotels in New York (state) Category:Saranac Lake, New York ",
