Contrary to most indigenous channels, PRO4 aired a wide array of series and movies, ranging from Hungarian and international classics to recent American blockbusters. On 10 May 2016, G\u00e1bor Fischer announced at the Media Hungary 2016 conference that PRO4 would be repositioned as a movie channel, known as Mozi+. The rebranding took effect on 11 July 2016, at 06:00 CET, when it started airing promos with a countdown, and Mozi+ officially launched at 21:00 CET. The first movie aired on the channel was World War Z. ==Series== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background- color:#E0E0E0\" ! | Original title ! | Hungarian title ! | Type ! | Original country |- | NCIS: Los Angeles || NCIS: Los Angeles || Crime || United States |- | Stargate: Atlantis || Csillagkapu: Atlantisz || Science-fiction || United States |- | Tyrant || Tyrant - A v\u00e9r k\u00f6telez || Action || United States |- | American Odyssey || A t\u00fal\u00e9l\u00e9s \u00e1ra || Action || United States |- | Blue Bloods || Zsaruv\u00e9r || Action || United States |- | Las Vegas || Las Vegas || Action- drama || United States |- | Continuum || Continuum || Science-fiction || United States |- | Community || Balf\u00e9kek || Sitcom || United States |- | NUMB3RS || Gyilkos sz\u00e1mok || Action || United States |- | Hawaii Five-0 || Hawaii Five-0 || Action || United States |- | Baywatch || Baywatch || Drama || United States |- | Justified || A t\u00f6rv\u00e9ny embere || Action || United States |} ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Television networks in Hungary Category:Television channels and stations established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Hungary ",
