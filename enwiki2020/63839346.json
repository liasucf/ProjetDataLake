She is a professor of mathematics at St. Mary's College of Maryland, and (for 2019\u20132022) the Steven Muller Distinguished Professor in the Sciences at St. Mary's College. ==Education and career== Goldstine graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in 1993. She completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at Harvard University in 1998. Her dissertation, Spin Representations and Lattices, was supervised by Benedict Gross. After postdoctoral and visiting assistant professorships at McMaster University, Ohio State University, and Amherst College, she joined the St. Mary's College faculty in 2004. ==Contributions== Goldstine has made and exhibited many pieces of mathematical art, often involving textiles. A set of bead crochet jewelry pieces by her visualizing the map coloring problem on three different manifolds won the prize for \"best textile, sculpture, or other medium\" in the art show of the 2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings. She is the coauthor of the book Crafting Conundrums: Puzzles and Patterns for the Bead Crochet Artist (with Ellie Baker, A K Peters / CRC Press, 2014). ==Personal life== Goldstine is the granddaughter of teacher and author Bel Kaufman. ==References== ==External links== *Home page Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Amherst College alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:St. Mary's College of Maryland faculty ",
