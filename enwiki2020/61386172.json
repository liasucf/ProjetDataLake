    "text": "Toyop\u00e1n (nahuatl: teo-ti, god, and bread, place), was the name of an old indigenous chieftaincy of Costa Rica, which in the 16th century, upon the arrival of the Spaniards, was ruled by the king Huedo Yorust\u00ed. The territories of the former Toyop\u00e1n cacicazgo included the current cantons of V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and Tib\u00e1s, in the San Jos\u00e9 Province, and San Isidro and Santo Domingo, in the Heredia Province. The main settlement of Toyop\u00e1n, the city of Apaikan, was in the current district of San Rafael.Botey Sobrado, Ana Mar\u00eda (2002). Costa Rica: desde las sociedades aut\u00f3ctonas hasta 1914.

The cacicazgo of Toyop\u00e1n was part of the Western Huetar Kingdom, ruled by King Garabito. In spite of this, according to the Spanish chronicles, Yorust\u00ed maintained good relations with the Accerr\u00ed and Currirav\u00e1 chiefs, who served the Se\u00f1or\u00edo del Guarco, since on more than one occasion he provided special assistance to the Accerr\u00ed chieftain. Toyop\u00e1n was visited in 1562 by adelantado Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, who after quickly making friends with the Yorust\u00ed chief, added this territory to the Spanish Crown, who wrote: In 1568, after the uprising of several indigenous peoples, the then governor Peraf\u00e1n de Ribera decided to attack several villages to obtain corn, which was scarce among the colonies of the Central Valley. Among these villages were Turrialba, Atirro, Corrosi, Cucurrique, Currirav\u00e1, Barva, Ujarr\u00e1s and Toyop\u00e1n. Several tripod ceremonial metates with hanging panels have been recovered from the old Toyop\u00e1n region. These are andesite monoliths that are considered invaluable archaeological pieces and unique artistic expressions of pre-Columbian Costa Rican art. These metates have become known as the \"Toyop\u00e1n Altars\", also called \"Ompa-Ontlaneci-Tetl\" (nahuatl, \"transparent stones\"). They are characterized by representing the anthropogenic myth, with a central figure that has been identified as the huetar concept of the rain deity, in addition to jaguars with a lizard mouth, snakes, a two-headed lizard and a monkey. These altars were buried by the Toyop\u00e1n suk\u00edas years after the conquest, to avoid their destruction by the Spanish catechists. The finding of numerous archaeological pieces of ceramics and stone in this region suggests that it was densely populated. ==References== Category:Former monarchies of Costa Rica Category:16th century in Costa Rica Category:Indigenous peoples in Costa Rica ",
