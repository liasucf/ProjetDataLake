    "text": "Havering College of Further and Higher Education is a college founded in 1947 in the London Borough of Havering that provides part-time and full-time education to students aged 14+. ==History== Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944, the Essex Education Committee acquired the majority of the Nelmes Estate in Hornchurch, including Victorian era Ardleigh House and surrounding 15 acres of land. Ardleigh House was initially used as a community and youth centre, and as a centre for part-time day release courses. The facilities were very basic, confined to upstairs rooms, and allowed only for basic instruction. Some years later, two additional classrooms with storage space were built, and the local authority Further Education Committee started to plan for an assembly hall and craft workshops for what was then called \u2018Ardleigh House Centre for Further Education\u2019. Expenditure was approved in 1949 for another 14,000 square ft. of administration and teaching facilities, as well as communal accommodation for a student population of 400. In 1958 A. W. Ebdon became Ardleigh House Centre for Further Education\u2019s second warden and oversaw the completion of the new facilities. He then became the first Principal of a newly renamed Hornchurch College of Further Education. During the 1970s there was a commitment to improve standards of training but pressure on space remained an issue. This issue was resolved with the adoption of the Quarles School site in Harold Hill. In 1992 the College was incorporated with its current name. ==Havering College Today== The College currently has three campuseshttps://www.havering-college.ac.uk/college/contacts; the main Ardleigh Green campus in Hornchurch, Quarles campus in Harold Hill, and the Rainham Campus Construction Centre in Rainham. A plan scheduled for 2020 is to substantially develop the capacity of Ardleigh Green and the Rainham Campus Construction Centre using the income from the concluded sale of the Quarles campus to Havering Borough Council. Lord Baker launched two Career Collegeshttps://www.havering-college.ac.uk/college/news/4361-lord-baker- launches-havering-as-a-construction-engineering-career-college in Construction and Engineering at Havering College in October 2017.
