The album features guest appearances from Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham, Wendy Melvoin, Henry Hey, and Tim Lefebvre. ==Background== The duo started writing their third studio album after contributing music to the 2014 film Dumb and Dumber To. The album was recorded in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and it was co-produced by Empire of the Sun and Peter Mayes alongside regular collaborator Jonathan Sloan. In November 2015, lead singer Luke Steele noted that the album was \"75 percent there\". On 22 August 2016, it was announced that the album was titled Two Vines and would be released on 28 October. It features contributions from Fleetwood Mac singer-guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, Wendy Melvoin (from Prince's The Revolution band), and David Bowie collaborators Henry Hey and Tim Lefebvre. Nick Littlemore explained the inspiration behind the title as \"this image of a modern city overtaken by jungle\". The album's lead single, \"High and Low\", was released on 24 August 2016. This was shortly followed by the album's first promotional single, \"Two Vines\", which was released the following day. \"To Her Door\" was released on 30 September 2016 as the album's second single. ==Critical reception== Two Vines received generally positive reviews from critics.
