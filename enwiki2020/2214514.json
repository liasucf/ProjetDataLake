    "text": "Oblique view from Lunar Orbiter 3, facing south, with Pauli at top and Roche at center Roche is a large crater on the far side of the Moon from the Earth. The prominent crater Pauli lies across the southern rim of Roche, and the outer rampart of Pauli covers a portion of Roche's interior floor. To the north-northwest of Roche is the crater E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, and just to the west-northwest lies Rosseland. The western rim of Roche has been somewhat distorted and straightened. The rim as a whole is worn and eroded, with multiple tiny craterlets marking the surface. The satellite crater Roche B lies across the northeastern inner wall. The interior floor of Roche is relatively level, but is also marked by several small and tiny craterlets. A grouping of these craters lies near the midpoint. Just to the northwest of this grouping is a bright patch of high-albedo material. Sections of the floor along the north- northwestern side have a lower albedo than elsewhere, usually an indication of basaltic-lava flows similar to what fills the lunar maria. The extent of this patch may actually be larger, but covered with higher-albedo ejecta. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Roche. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Roche !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|40.1\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|137.2\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|24 km |- |align=\"center\"|C |align=\"center\"|39.0\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|139.2\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|18 km |- |align=\"center\"|V |align=\"center\"|38.5\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|129.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|30 km |- |align=\"center\"|W |align=\"center\"|39.0\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|130.5\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|20 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
