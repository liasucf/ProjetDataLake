His 1523 Kogan Pyo () based on the Hatthip\u0101la J\u0101taka, is among the most widely known pyo in modern-day Myanmar, and is taught in Burmese schools. His Buridat Pyo (; based on the Bh\u016bridatta J\u0101taka) is also considered an exemplar of the medieval literary style, is considered a masterpiece of Burmese classical poetry. Ra\u1e6d\u1e6dhas\u0101ra also composed metrical versions of other Jataka tales, including the Sa\u1e43varaj\u0101taka, besides a number of other poems. Despite his poetic contributions, Burmese chroniclers excluded him from the succession of elders (thera), because he not only wrote verse, but also recited and instructed pupils in the art of recitation, which was considered a transgression of the Vinaya, specifically the rules governing singing and dancing. ==Background== Ra\u1e6d\u1e6dhas\u0101ra was born on 1468 in Ava Kingdom and growing up in royal palace of Ava.

He taught astrology, poetry and Pali under a Buddhist monk, Varacakkap\u0101la () and Thiho Sayadaw (). He began writing poems at the age of 12. At 16,he wrote Buridat Pyo (). His writer rival is Shin Maha Silavamsa (). A prolific writer, he wrote many pyo, mawgun () and other types of poems during his lifetime. His last work was Thanwara Pyo (), based on the Sa\u1e43varaj\u0101taka.
