    "text": "Fukagawa Edo Museum in Koto, Tokyo The Fukagawa Edo Museum is a museum of old Edo in the former Fukagawa ward (now K\u014dt\u014d ward) of Tokyo, Japan. It consists of a large, covered, life-size replica of a Tokyo shitamachi neighborhood from around 1840, near the end of the Tokugawa period. It includes 11 buildings: houses, shops, a theater, a boathouse, a tavern, and a fire tower, all built using traditional techniques. Visitors can walk down the streets and enter the shops and houses. The lighting varies over time, to reproduce different times of day.DK Eyewitness Tokyo, 2017, , p. 76Simon Richmond, Jan Dodd, The Rough Guide to Tokyo, 2011, p. 62Tom Flannigan, Ellen Flannigan, Tokyo Museum Guide: A Complete Guide, 2012, , p. 107 The museum opened in 1986, six years after the Shitamachi Museum and seven years before the Edo-Tokyo Museum, all part of a national trend for building local history museums. The exhibits for all three were primarily designed by Total Media.Jordan Sand, Jordan, Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects, University of California Press, 2013, , p. 120 ==External links== * Official site ==Notes== Category:History museums in Japan Category:Museums in Tokyo Category:Buildings and structures in Koto, Tokyo Category:Vernacular architecture in Japan Category:Museums established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in Japan ",
