    "text": "Robert Smit was a member of South Africa's National Party, and was murdered together with his wife Jean-Cora in 1977. They were survived by their two children, who were staying at their Roper Street home in Pretoria. ==Death and aftermath== The Smits were shot several times and stabbed in their Springs, Transvaal home on 22 November 1977. The words \"RAU TEM\" were spray-painted in red on the walls and kitchen cupboards. Dr. Smit was the managing director of Santam, South Africa's largest short-term insurance company and one that the South African government used to circumvent sanctions with regard to the procurement of sensitive military and economic resources. Many theories have been proferred regarding the reasons for the murders as well as the identity of the perpetrators. One was that he had become aware of a massive scam by South African politicians, to enrich themselves during his sojourn with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) the preceding year, and that he was about to \"blow the whistle\" on these people. However this was never confirmed and no arrests were ever made. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders ==External links== *Smit murders not solved, News 24.com ==References== Category:1977 deaths Category:Assassinated South African politicians Category:Murdered politicians Category:National Party (South Africa) politicians Category:People murdered in South Africa Category:Unsolved murders in South Africa Category:Year of birth missing ",
