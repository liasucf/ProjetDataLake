    "text": "Terri Leslie Garber (born December 28, 1960 in Miami, Florida) is an American actress and entrepreneur. ==Career== Garber's acting debut was as Allison Linden on the daytime soap opera Texas in 1982. Her first feature film role in the 1984 action film Toy Soldiers. Garber's breakout role was wicked Southern belle Ashton Main in the 1985 ABC miniseries North and South, based on the 1982 novel of the same name by John Jakes. It remains the seventh highest rated miniseries in TV history. Garber reprised the role for the 1986 sequel miniseries, North and South: Book II, as well as for the 1994 final installment, Heaven and Hell: North and South Book III. She described Ashton: Garber portrayed the role of Leslie Carrington on the primetime soap Dynasty from 1987\u201388. She appeared alone on the cover of TV Guide for the September 5, 1987 issue (#1797), which included an interview with her. After Dynasty, Garber made guest appearances in various series including Quantum Leap, Murder She Wrote, and Midnight Caller, and appeared in the Australian film Beyond My Reach (1990). In the 1990s, she landed roles in two daytime soap operas: Suzanne Collier on Santa Barbara from 1991\u201392 and Victoria Parker on General Hospital in 1993. Most recently, Garber portrayed the recurring role of Iris Dumbrowski on the daytime soap opera As the World Turns in 2005, returning from November 2006-10. In 2012, Garber appeared as Elizabeth Archer in the series finale of the teen drama web series Miss Behave. She later won a 2013 Indie Soap Award for Best Guest Appearance in a Drama for the performance. In 2013, Garber played a therapist on the web series Old Dogs & New Tricks (Season 2, Episode 10: \"Last Gasps\"). ==Personal life== Garber grew up in Miami, the youngest of three children of a lawyer father and a cooking-school owner mother. She did some modeling from ages 4 to 13, and always wanted to be a performer. Garber told TV Guide in 1987 that she chose acting over singing because \"I was too nervous to sing in front of people\u2014it meant showing more of myself than acting. If you're on stage singing and people don't like it, that's too much rejection.\" She later moved to New York, where her casual drug use became what she called \"a huge problem\". She overcame the addiction before being cast in North and South. Garber met her first husband, screenwriter Christopher \"Chris\" Hager, when he was working as a grip on the set of North and South: Book II in 1985. She and Hager are the parents of actress and singer Molly E. Hager (b. 1986). That union ended in divorce in 1989. Her second marriage, to Frank Michael Howson (July 21, 2001 \u2013 June 24, 2002), also ended in divorce. In 2013, Garber married director William Roudebush, her former high school drama teacher that she had once been engaged to when she was age 17. Garber and her sister Lisa Garber Rubenstein began a business handmaking all-natural soap in various scents and styles, known as SistersAlchemy.http://www.sistersalchemy.com/ == Filmography == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1984 |Toy Soldiers |Amy |film debut |- |1985 |Key Exchange |Amy | |- |1990 |Beyond My Reach |Terri Neilson | |- |1998 |Slappy and the Stinkers |Mrs. Witzowitz | |- |2001 |Thank You, Good Night |Sultry Older Woman | |- |2005 |Adam and Eve |Eve's Mom | |- |2010 |Perhaps Tomorrow |Annie |Short film |} === Television === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1982 |Texas |Allison Linden |Episode: \"#1.612\" |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1983 |Mr. Smith |Dr. Judy Tyson |Series regular; 13 episodes |- |Lone Star |Deputy Cissy Wells |Television movie |- |1984 |No Man's Land |Brianne Wilder |Television movie |- |1985 |North and South Book I | rowspan=\"2\" |Ashton Main | rowspan=\"2\" |Television miniseries |- |1986 |North and South Book II |- |1987\u20131988 |Dynasty |Leslie Carrington |Series regular; 36 episodes |- |1988 |The Twilight Zone |Debra Brockman |Episode: \"Our Selena Is Dying\" |- | rowspan=\"4\" |1989 |Quantum Leap |Teresa Pacci |Episode: \"Double Identity\" |- |Murder, She Wrote |Loretta Lee |Episode: \"Three Strikes, You're Out\" |- |My Two Dads |Karen Martin |2 episodes |- |Matlock |Valerie Walsh |Episode: \"The Fugitive\" |- | rowspan=\"3\" |1990 |Sporting Chance |Hoop Tracy |Television movie |- |Jake and the Fatman |Casey Quinn |Episode: \"Night and Day\" |- |Shades of LA |Julie |Episode: \"Big Brother Is Watching\" |- |1991 |Midnight Caller |Kate Killian |Episode: \"The Loneliest Number\" |- |1991\u20131992 |Santa Barbara |Suzanne Collier |Series regular |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1993 |Raven |Jennifer |Episode: \"Bloody Beach\" |- |General Hospital |Victoria Parker |7 episodes |- |1994 |North and South Book III |Ashton Main |Television miniseries (3 episodes) |- |1995 |Bless This House |Mrs. Rasmussen |Episode: \"Neither a Borrower Nor a Landlord Be\" |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1996 |Renegade |Lisa Corcoran |Episode: \"The Road Not Taken\" |- |Charlie Grace |Ruby O'Conner |Episode: \"Steal One for the Gipper\" |- |1999 |7th Heaven |Dr. Nancy Burns |Episode: \"Forget Me Not\" |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2001 |ER |Dr. Alexander |Episode: \"Survival of the Fittest\" |- |Judging Amy |Toni Eggers |Episode: \"Look Closer\" |- |Family Law |40-Year-Old Woman |Episode: \"Sex, Lies, and Internet\" |- |2004 |Cold Case |Abbey Lake |Episode: \"Late Returns\" |- |2005\u20132010 |As the World Turns |Iris Dumbrowski |Series regular |- |2006 |Law & Order |Mrs. Carroll |Episode: \"In Vino Veritas\" |- |2010 |Law & Order: Criminal Intent |Mrs. Becker |Episode: \"Inhumane Society\" |- |2012 |Miss Behave |Elizabeth Archer |Web series/Episode: \"Goodbye, for Now: Part 3\" Indie Series Award for Best Guest Appearance (Drama) |- |2013 |Old Dogs & New Tricks |Dr. Leslie Ashley |Episode: \"Last Gasps\" |- |2014 |SnakeHead Swamp |Carley |Television movie |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American television actresses Category:American soap opera actresses Category:Actresses from Miami ",
