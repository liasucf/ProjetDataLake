Pagewood has a mixture of residential and industrial areas. ==History== Pagewood was originally planned as a garden suburb, similar to neighbouring Daceyville. However, it was developed to provide housing after World War I when there was a shortage of land. The new suburb began developing in 1919 as an estate called Monash Gardens. The suburb was named Pagewood in 1929 to honour the late Alderman Fred Page, the Mayor of Botany Council in 1928. National Studios was opened in 1935 and for nearly thirty years, Australian and British cinema was produced here. In 1940, the site was bought by General Motors Holden,http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=214609http://southern- courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/manufacturing-heart/ which operated a car manufacturing plant until 1981.

In 1960, the council considered changing the suburb name to East Botany.
