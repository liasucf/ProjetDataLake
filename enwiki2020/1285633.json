    "text": "Alpinia purpurata, red ginger, also called ostrich plume and pink cone ginger, are native Malaysian plants with showy flowers on long brightly colored red bracts. They look like the bloom, but the true flower is the small white flower on top. It has cultivars called Jungle King and Jungle Queen. Red Ginger grows in Hawaii, Trinidad, Grenada, St. Lucia, Panama, Dominica, St. Vincent, Martinique, Jamaica, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Suriname (where its Dutch name is 'bokkepoot', billy-goat's foot), and many Central American nations, including Belize. It is also found in Samoa, where it is the national flower, and is locally called \"teuila.\" Red ginger can also be grown in South Florida since, in general, the region does not fall below freezing temperatures. It prefers partial shade and moist humid conditions, although it can tolerate full sun in some climates. It tends to like to be well watered and not left to dry out. Red ginger can also be grown as a houseplant and its cut flowers can be used in arrangements. Red ginger tends to spread. ==Gallery== File:Alpinia purpurata in Malaysia 2.JPG|Red Ginger flowering in Malaysia File:Alpinia purpurata Malaysia.jpg|More Red Ginger plants in Malaysia File:Alpinia purpurata, SBG.jpg|Alpinia purpurata, Singapore Botanical Gardens File:Bunga Lengkuas Merah.jpg|Red Ginger plants in Kebun Raya Bogor in Bogor, Indonesia ==External links== *Images of Red Ginger * Alpinia purpurata fotografiada Honolulu, Hawaii Galer\u00eda de Plantas del Mundo Oficina Verde de la Universidad de Murcia https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/gardening/article/Try-these-3-summer- plants-to-add-color-to-beds-15234885.php https://www.news- press.com/story/life/2016/09/14/subtropical-pinecone-ginger-exotic- scarlet/90347722/ purpurata ",
