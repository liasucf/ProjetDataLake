It was established by an Act of Congress, moving the Department of Agriculture's main research from the National Mall to Arlington. It grew hemp beginning in 1903 (under the cultivation of Lyster Dewey), or 1914. In 1928, it was the largest United States Department of Agriculture experiment station in the Washington, D.C. area. USDA researcher Vera Charles also worked at the station, collecting Cannabis seeds from across America and studying pests and pathogens that could diminish hemp crop productivity. Cultivars developed at Arlington include Arlington, Chington, Ferramington, Kymington and Arlington; Chington and Kymington were adopted \"extensively\" by seed farmers producing hemp in Kentucky. The seeds were probably destroyed by the government in the 1980s. In the 1930s, research was transferred to Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland. The land the farm had occupied became Arlington Farms temporary housing during World War II and was developed for the site of The Pentagon and its parking lots. ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==Further reading== * * Category:1900 establishments in Virginia Category:Agricultural research institutes in the United States Category:Cannabis cultivation Category:Farms in Virginia Category:Hemp agriculture Category:Research stations Category:United States Department of Agriculture facilities ",
