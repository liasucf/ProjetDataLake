Okna is ostensibly a talk show where troubled or dysfunctional families come to discuss their problems before a studio audience so that the audience or host can offer suggestions on what can be done to resolve their situations. The show has become very popular on Russian television. It received attention in the UK after a fight was televised on Tarrant On TV, which has also led to its popularity growing on the internet via YouTube. ==References== Category:STS (TV channel) original programming Category:TNT (Russian TV channel) original programming Category:2000s Russian television series Category:2002 Russian television series debuts Category:2005 Russian television series endings Category:Russian television talk shows ",
