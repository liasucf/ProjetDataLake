    "text": "Mister Myst\u00e8re, released in 2009, is the fourth studio album by French singer- songwriter Matthieu Chedid in his persona as -M- (or fifth if including the instrumental album, Labo M). It was his first studio album after a six-year hiatus during which he had concentrated on live music along with side projects including collaborations with his father, Louis Chedid, Malian musicians Amadou & Mariam and French singer Vanessa Paradis (notably on the album Divinidylle). == Style and reception == The reappearance of -M- in a more sombre 'black-and-white' persona without his former reliance on vivid colours (notably pink) and wild distinctive haircut caused considerable media attention. The music remained an idiosyncratic mix but was declared by critics to be 'innovative'France Info review with 'more sensual' lyricsFrance Info review that overall represented a 'successful metamorphosis'France Info review for the artist. However, other critics saw the project as falling flat and Telerama considered that only D\u00e9livre and L'\u00e9lixir really broke the funky monotony of the work.Telerama Review Commercially successful in France Mister Myst\u00e8re sold 51,000 copiesFrench chart tracker site in the first week of release, out-selling rival albums One Love by David Guetta and Volume 10 by Marc Lavoine.
