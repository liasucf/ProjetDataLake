Originally he wanted to be a musician and learned viola in the Sz\u00e9kesf\u0151v\u00e1rosi Fels\u0151bb Zenei Iskola musical school. From 1951 he worked as a playreader on Hungarian Radio, and in 1957 he became the director of the art department of the Hungarian State Concert and Programme Directorate. Between 1960 and 1962 he was the director of the popular art section of Hungarian Television. From 1962 he was a playreader in the Main Musical Department of Hungarian Radio. He wrote several librettos for Hungarian operas, including Hunyady for Rezs\u0151 Sug\u00e1r (1953), B\u00e1thory Zsigmond for Horusitzky Zolt\u00e1n (1960), and Muzsikus P\u00e9ter for Gy\u00f6rgy R\u00e1nki (1963). He translated several operas and musicals into Hungarian; the best known is Cats. He wrote scripts for the cartoons L\u00fadas Matyi and H\u00f3feh\u00e9r. He is known for his animal poems that were released after his death with the title Szam\u00e1rf\u00fcl (\"Earmark\" and \"Ear of a Donkey\"). He is perhaps best known for the scripts of various Hungarian cartoon series, including M\u00e9zga Csal\u00e1d (The Gums), the K\u00e9rem a k\u00f6vetkez\u0151t! (\"Next, please!\" or \"Dr. Bubo\", 1973-74) and some translations for dubbed versions of American cartoons, like the rhyming translation of The Flintstones and of Huckleberry Hound. He was nicknamed \"Romh\u00e1nyi, a r\u00edmh\u00e1ny\u00f3\", a rhyme meaning \"Romhanyi the Rhyme-Thrower\". == Sources == * Rem\u00e9nyi Gyenes Istv\u00e1n: Ismerj\u00fck \u0151ket?
