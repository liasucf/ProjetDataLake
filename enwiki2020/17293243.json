These were reorganised in 1916 by General Don into a school at Buena Vista and another on Castle Street, Gibraltar. The priority given to the schools however can be judged by their closure in 1828 when the Barrack Master was demanding the premises. This was unfortunate as examinations were in progress and the schools were open to better off civilians who could afford the dollar a week charges. Of the 180 children available, 70 had been attending. The regrowth of the schools can be assigned to Mary Ann Rule who was the wife of William Harris Rule a newly arrived Methodist missionary in Gibraltar. They had both learnt Spanish and Mary was asked to teach one child to read. She was joined by her brother and then other Catholics and then Jewish children. Rule noted that he became unawares the founder of the first charity school in the garrison\". The Jews eventually withdrew on religious grounds and Rule was involved when the Lieutenant Governor Sir William Houston set up the first official free school on Flat Bastion Road in 1832 and he sent his own children there. The following year Rule restarted his school requiring his pupils to attend Methodist services each Sunday. In reply the Catholics arranged for two teachers from the Congregation of Christian Brothers to start the Christian Brothers School in 1835. Rules school however was popular across the faiths but this came to a head in 1839 when his school marched down Main Street on the centenary of Methodism with 400 children of all faiths and denominations waiving messages in support of Methodism. ==See also== * Education in England * University of Gibraltar ==References== ==External links== * List of schools in Gibraltar.
