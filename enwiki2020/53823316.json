Born Jeanne Dominique Marie Therese Allamand Madaune to a French family based in Chile, she was an influential figure in the early development of children's literature in that country. She was the director of the PEN Club and a member of the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY). She received several awards, including the 1962 Municipal Prize of Santiago in the short story category and the 1969 IBBY CRAV prize. ==Biography== Mait\u00e9 Allamand spent her childhood in the countryside on the banks of the Maule River, after her father's job transferred him there. This rural environment influenced her later work. In 1920 she enrolled in the Sacred Heart College of Talca, where she learned to speak and read Spanish. After finishing her education, Allamand worked in the legation to Belgium, thanks to her mastery of French. She remained in this position from 1932 until 1940, when she married the doctor and researcher Luis Herv\u00e9. ==Select bibliography== * 1933 - Cosas de campo * 1936 - Parvas viejas * 1944 - Renovales * 1950 - Alamito el Largo * 1960 - El funeral del diablo * 1966 - Huellas en la ciudad * 1969 - El sue\u00f1o y la lumbre * 1974 - La ni\u00f1a de las trenzas de lana * 1991 - Cerr\u00edn que quer\u00eda crecer * 1993 - El buz\u00f3n colorado ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Chilean diplomats Category:Chilean novelists Category:Chilean people of French descent Category:Chilean women short story writers Category:Women children's writers Category:Writers from Santiago Category:20th-century Chilean women writers Category:20th-century Chilean writers Category:Chilean women diplomats ",
