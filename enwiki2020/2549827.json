    "text": "Abram Petrovich Gannibal, also Hannibal or Ganibal, or Abram Hannibal or Abram Petrov (; c. 1696 \u2013 14 May 1781), was a Russian military engineer, general, and nobleman of African origin. Kidnapped as a child, Gannibal was taken to Russia and presented as a gift to Peter the Great, where he was freed, adopted and raised in the Emperor's court household as his godson.Phillips, Mike. \"Pushkin's African background \u2013 the Pushkins and the Gannibals.\" British Library. Retrieved May 26, 2016. Gannibal eventually rose to become a prominent member of the imperial court in the reign of Peter's daughter Elizabeth. He had 11 children, most of whom became members of the Russian nobility; he was a great-grandfather of the author and poet Alexander Pushkin. ==Early life== The main reliable accounts of Gannibal's life come from The Moor of Peter the Great, Pushkin's unfinished biography of his great- grandfather, published after Pushkin's death in 1837. Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author\u2019s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel The Blackamoor of Peter the Great, based on his great-grandfather. An historical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law, Rotkirkh, was largely responsible for the myth, propagated by some historians, that Gannibal was born in Ethiopia.Gee, Maggie. \"Dark star of the Enlightenment. How did an African slave surmount 18th- century attitudes to become a top military commander and intimate of Peter the Great? Maggie Gee charts an extraordinary life.\", New Statesman, 8 August 2005. Retrieved May 20, 2016. However, more recent research by the scholars Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes has established that the general was instead likely born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in present-day Cameroon. ===Abduction=== Richard Pankhurst, the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor \"prince\" or chief whose capital was Logon (now part of present-day Cameroon). His father was relatively affluent, owning many slaves both inherited and taken in battle. He had several wives and 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the Ottoman Turks, Abram was captured and taken to Constantinople by ship (see Slavery in the Ottoman Empire). His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother. Abram stayed in the Ottoman Empire for about a year in the service of Sultan Ahmed III's household. At the time, the Russian ambassador Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, representing Peter the Great, was looking for \"a few clever little African slaves\" for the Tsar's palace in Moscow, as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, great- grandfather of the celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a bribe. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great. The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy\u2019s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household. Abram was baptized in 1705, in St. Paraskeva Church in Vilnius, with Peter as his godfather. The date of Gannibal\u2019s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth. Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter (Elizabeth), and was loyal to them as if they were family. Starting at a young age, the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather\u2019s valet.Blakely, Allison.

Retrieved May 20, 2016. ==Education== 1888 artist's conception of Gannibal speaking with Alexander Suvorov. In 1717, Abram was sent to Metz to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in mathematics and geometry. In 1718 Abram joined the French Army with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in military engineering. He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at La F\u00e8re in 1720. During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between France and Spain, and he fought for France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz. It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname \"Gannibal\" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (Gannibal being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian).Schmemann, Serge. \"Of African Princes and Russian Poets.\" The New York Times, November 12, 2010. Retrieved June 7, 2016. In Paris he met and befriended such Enlightenment figures as the Baron de Montesquieu and Voltaire (this claim by his biographer Hugh Barnes is disputed by reviewer Andrew KahnBlack Russian \u2013 A Review by Andrew Kahn of Hugh Barnes' Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg. ). Voltaire called Gannibal the \"dark star of the Enlightenment\".Barnes, Hugh. Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg. London: Profile Books, 2006. . 4, 219. Retrieved May 23, 2016. Gannibal returned to Russia the following year, and his advanced training enabled him to apply for and successfully acquire posts first as an engineer and then as a mathematics tutor for one of the Tsar's private guard units. ==Career== Letter signed by A. Ganibal (note only one 'n') on 22 March 1744. Tallinn City Archives. Portrait of German-Russian General Ivan Ivanovich M\u00f6ller-Sakomelsky (identified by Natalya Teletova, others identify it as a portrait of Abram Petrovich Gannibal) Gannibal's education was completed by 1723, and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, Prince Menshikov gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education. Gannibal was exiled to Siberia in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of Saint Petersburg. He first traveled to Kazan, then to Tobolsk and Irkutsk, and then to Selenginsk near the Mongolian border. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer. Elizabeth of Russia became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by \"A. Ganibal\" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the Mikhailovskoye estate in Pskov Oblast with hundreds of serfs.Gnammankou, Dieudonn\u00e9. Abraham Hanibal \u2013 l\u2019a\u00efeul noir de Pouchkine. Paris: Presence Africaine, 1996. . 129. Retrieved May 25, 2016. He retired to this estate in 1762. In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of nobility and a coat of arms, he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word \"FVMMO\", which may mean \"homeland\" in the Kotoko language. In his book, Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg, Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian, met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino which means \"Fortune has changed my life entirely.\" ==Family== Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a Greek woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was forced to marry. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile, and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage.Parry, Albert (1923). \"Abram Hannibal, the Favorite of Peter the Great.\" Journal of Negro History 8.4: 359\u201366. JSTOR. Retrieved May 25, 2016. Gannibal\u2019s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years. Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Si\u00f6berg (1705\u20131781), daughter of Mattias Johan Si\u00f6berg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her bigamously in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal\u2019s second marriage to Christina was much happier, and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him. On her paternal side, Gannibal\u2019s second wife was descended from noble families in Scandinavia and Germany: Si\u00f6berg (Sweden), Galtung (Norway), and Grabow (Denmark) / von Grabow (Brandenburg). Her paternal grandfather was Gustaf Si\u00f6berg, Rittmester til Estrup, who died in 1694, whose wife Clara Maria Lauritzdatter Galtung (ca. 1651\u20131698) was the daughter of Lauritz Lauritzson Galtung (ca. 1615\u20131661) and of Barbara Grabow til Pederstrup (1631\u20131696). Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Si\u00f6berg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of Alexander Pushkin. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who helped found the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine in 1779 and attained the rank of general-in-chief, the second-highest military rank in imperial Russia. Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and her sister, Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn. George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, is also a direct descendant, as the grandson of Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven.

Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in Ethiopia.Marsden, Phillip. \"From Slave to Slav.\" theguardian.com, October 21, 2005. Retrieved June 6, 2016. Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of Medri Bahri, an ancient kingdom in present-day Eritrea.*Smith (1957, p. 245) postulates that \"Logon\" stood \"on the northern side of the Mareb River in what is now called Eritrea\". *Troyat (1957, p. 244) asserts that the place of Hannibal's origin was \"on the banks of the Mareb River in what is now Eritrea\". *N. Ismailov posits that the Logon was located in the \"Hamasien Eritrean plateau\" (see Pankhurst, 1961, p. 423). *Yosief (2000, pp. 36\u201340) notes that at the time, the overall ruler of Medri Bahri Eritrea was Degezmati Habtesulus of Tseazega, who was in control of the region from 1679 till 1719. In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of \"Logon\" or \"Lagone\". Anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that \"Lagone\" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea. In 1999, the Russian Institute in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a commemorative stamp to honor Pushkin's bicentennial. The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a bust of him near the African Union headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from Moscow to Addis Ababa in 2014.\"Addis Abab awaits Pushkin statue from Moscow.\" www.worldbulletin.net, October 8, 2014. Retrieved June 8, 2016. However, the notion that Gannibal may have been born in Ethiopia holds little currency with the general Ethiopian population. The Eritrean government asserts that Gannibal was instead born in Loggo Sarda, an area in modern Eritrea.\"Loggo Sarda: Eritrea.\" www.geographic.org. Retrieved June 8, 2016. It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009. Vladimir Nabokov cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin. Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to \"the Lagona region of equatorial Africa, south of Lake Chad.\" Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that \"hamitic\" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than \"negroid\" origins. The Beninese historian Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou, an expert on Russia, studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from Logone- Birni and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the \"Logon\" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old Kotoko kingdom of Logone-Birni, now located in northern Cameroon. He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than Gondar, Ethiopia. Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair. Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for \"homeland\" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa. ===Honor at La F\u00e8re=== In November, 2010, representatives from Russia and Estonia, the ambassador of Cameroon, and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to La F\u00e8re, France to unveil a commemorative plaque honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La F\u00e8re's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by King Louis XV shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La F\u00e8re, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La F\u00e8re taking place, also served as the main speaker at a symposium following the event. ==Popular culture== Coat of arms of Abram Gannibal ===Literature=== Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel The Moor of Peter the Great. After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to \"get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather.\"Phillips, Mike. \"The Negro of Peter the Great.\" British Library. Retrieved June 10, 2016. He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for The Moor of Peter the Great.

Retrieved June 12, 2016. ===Art and film=== Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor, although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's Moor of Peter the Great.\"Tale of How Tsar Peter Married off His Negro.\" www.rusfilm.pitt.edu, 2006. Retrieved June 10, 2016. There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin\u2019s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy\u2019s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal\u2019s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck\u2019s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate. In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great. ==See also== *Afro-Russian *Representation of slavery in European art *List of enslaved people ==Notes== ==References== ==Biographies== * Life of Ganibal, D.
