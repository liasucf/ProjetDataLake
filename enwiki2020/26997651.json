The video begins with a voice announcing \"In Vengavision 3DD, Rocket To Uranus\". Vengaboys are then shown on the spaceship with occasional flashes of the group arriving and dancing on Uranus. They are welcomed by the inhabitants who join in dancing. The scene then shifts to Phalzistor (cameo by Pete Burns) who, after seeing the Vengaboys, wants them \"Dead or Alive\" and wishes to destroy the planet. The Vengaboys respond to the turmoil on Uranus by revealing their torpedo-like sides of the rocket, to be speakers which play \"Venga-sound\". Phalzistor's minions stop fighting and start dancing. He then teleports to the planet to regain control. Once he realises it's in vain, the \"Venga-sound\" forces his head to explode. Everybody on the planet proceeds to dance in celebration. There are two versions: One in 2D (the regular video); one in stereoscopic 3D (where red/cyan glasses are required). The video itself is the same in both versions. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2010) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:Songs about spaceflight Category:Uranus in fiction Category:2010 singles Category:Vengaboys songs Category:Songs written by Anders Wollbeck Category:2010 songs Category:Songs written by Mattias Lindblom ",
