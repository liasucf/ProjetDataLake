    "text": "Coin of Wamba bearing his effigy. Wamba (Medieval Latin: VVamba, Vamba, Wamba; 643 \u2013 687/688) was the king of the Visigoths from 672 to 680. During his reign, the Visigothic kingdom encompassed all of Hispania and part of southern Gaul known as Septimania. According to Herwig Wolfram, Wamba means \"big paunch\" in Gothic (like German: \"Wampe\", cognate to English \"womb\") and may have been a nickname.History of the Goths, trans. Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), p. 463 n. 326 Both Julian of Toledo in his Historia Wambae (History of Wamba) and the decisions of the eleventh Council of Toledo, held under Wamba's auspices, only refer to the king as Wamba. ==History== ===Military events=== Statue in Madrid (A. Carnicero, 1750\u201353). After ascending the throne on 1 September 672, Wamba faced a revolt from Hilderic, governor of N\u00eemes, who had himself aspired to the kingship. Hilderic was supported by Gunhild, Bishop of Maguelonne. Wamba sent the dux (general) Paul to put down the rebels, but upon his arrival at Narbonne, he induced his officers to renounce their loyalty to Wamba and elect him king as Flavius Paulus. He was joined by Hilderic and his followers, as well as Duke Ranosindus of Tarraconensis and the gardingatus (a palace official) Hildigisus. Paul recruited \"multitudes\" of Franks and Basques to bolster his forces.Historia Wambae Regis auctore Juliano episcopo Toletano, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum tomus V, Passiones Vitaeque Sanctorum Aevi Merovingici, pp. 504\u201307. Following this the Visigothic cities in Gaul and a large part of northeastern Hispania came over to Paul's side.Bishop Julian of Toledo, in his History of King Wamba, accuses Paul of crowning himself with a votive crown King Reccared (the king who converted the Visigoths from Arianism to Catholicism) had dedicated to the body of St. Felix in Girona. Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, p. 522. During these events, Wamba was in Cantabria campaigning against the Basques.Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, p. 507. Roger Collins, The Basques (2nd ed., 1990, Blackwell: Cambridge, Mass.) points out that \"there exists a measure of looseness about the use of the name of Cantabria\" both before and after Wamba's time, so it could include a wider area than at present. See Collins, pp. 92\u201393, 138\u201339. In response, Wamba marched into the Tarraconensis region, and in a few days turned most of the cities back to his side. He then divided his forces into three groups, attacking over the Pyrenees by way of Ll\u00edvia (then the capital of Cerdanya), Auch, and the coastal road, taking the fortresses of Collioure, Vulturaria, and Ll\u00edvia, finding \"much\" gold and silver there.Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, pp. 509\u201311. As Wamba moved on Narbonne, Paul placed General Wittimer in charge of the city and retired to N\u00eemes. Wamba's forces quickly subdued Narbonne and then, after some difficulty, secured the surrender of N\u00eemes on September 3, 673. Paul and the other rebel leaders surrendered and, three days later, were brought to trial, scalped, and imprisoned for life. A period of peace followed and, in 674, Wamba rebuilt the Roman walls around Toledo. He also fortified other sites about this time, possibly Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), Santiago Sanchez, Alberto Zulueta & Javier Barrallo: CAAD and Historical Buildings: The Importance of the Simulation of the Historical Process The University of the Basque Country, 2009 a small village in Spain facing the French border over the Txingurri bay, as a military thrust along the Bay of Biscay up to the Pyrenees is attested to in contemporary sources. Wamba brought the Astures and Ruccones (Luggones) under his control and incorporated them into a new province. They had been fighting for their independence since the Visigothic invasions of the 5th century but now finally relented. After the rebellion, the kingdom faced a new threat in the form of Saracen raiders. In the Chronicle of Alfonso III (written 200 years later) it stated, \"In Wamba's time, 270 Saracen ships attacked the coast of Hispania and there all of them were burned.\" A single attack of this size is doubtful, however, because no other source mentions it. The Chronicle of 754 declared Moors \"had long been raiding\" Andalusia \"and simultaneously devastating many cities\"; however, the Chronicle of 754s most recent English translator, Kenneth Baxter Wolf, holds that this refers to the year before the defeat of King Roderic by the Moors, over three decades after the removal of Wamba.Kenneth Baxter Wolf, tr., Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain, 2nd edition, Liverpool University Press, 1999, p. 131. The Chronicle of 754 mentions Wamba's building projects in Toledo and the Eleventh Council of Toledo, but does not identify any Muslim raids in his time. The law books and decrees of the time reveal a substantial erosion of domestic tranquility and order within the kingdom. In the Visigothic law books, Wamba decrees that all the people, regardless of their religion, and even if they are clergy, are required to defend the kingdom if it is attacked by a foreign foe. This law was created to solve a problem of desertion: \"For, whenever an enemy invades the provinces of our kingdom \u2026 [many of] those who inhabit the border \u2026 disappear so that, by this means, there is no mutual support in battle.\" This rationale may imply a frequency of raids. That the people were often unwilling to defend the kingdom is further shown by another of Wamba's edicts, in which slaves were freed in order to the fill the ranks of the army. This suggests not only a shortage of volunteers from among the Hispano-Romans who made up the bulk of the population ruled by the Visigothic lords, but also an army heavy in conscripts and the coerced. ===Religious events=== In 675, the Third Council of Braga was held in Braga (Bracara), Hispania. This Catholic conclave promulgated eight decrees affecting ritual, the handling of sacred vessels, who may or may not live with a priest, unacceptable forms of punishment of clergy, and unacceptable forms of payment of clergy and rectors. In the same year, the Eleventh Council of Toledo was convened in November. Wamba renouncing the Crown. Oil on canvas by Juan Antonio de Ribera (1819) Wamba was a reformist king who, according to Charles Julian Bishko, \"tried to set up at Aquis (Chaves) in Lusitania a monastic see of the same type as Dume\u2013Braga, i. e., involving the sort of episcopus sub regula associated with early pactualism. This manoeuvre was successfully blocked by the metropolitan church of Em\u00e9rita with the full support of the fathers of the XIIth Council of Toledo (681).\"Charles Julian Bishko.

The Library of Iberian Resources Online. Retrieved 11 September 2014. ===Succession=== In 680, Wamba fell ill or (according to the Chronicle of Alfonso III two hundred years later) was poisoned in Pampliega, near Burgos. He received the order of penance in anticipation of his death, and as a result was forced to step down as king upon his recovery. The Chronicle of Alfonso III blames Wamba's successor Erwig for this; some modern commentators have blamed Julian of Toledo, who was made primate of the Visigothic church by Erwig (in reward for his services?).See Wolf, tr., Conquerors and Chroniclers, pp. 162\u201363; Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain; Unity in Diversity, 400\u20131000, 2nd edition, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 77\u201378, regards this as \"quite unnecessarily Machiavellian.\" But Julian perpetuated the memory of Wamba in his account of the revolt of Paul, Historia Wambae Reg\u00eds. ==Legend== ===Birthplace=== According to one tradition, Wamba was born in Egit\u00e2nia, a modest village surrounded by Roman walls that is today called Idanha-a-Velha, and located to the northeast of Castelo Branco in Portugal. A Spanish tradition has him born in Galicia in the parish of Santa Mar\u00eda de Doz\u00f3n in an old house with a shield. Manuel de Sousa da Silva, a seventeenth-century Portuguese genealogist, in his work Nobili\u00e1rio das Gera\u00e7\u00f5es de Entre-Douro-e- Minho, refers to this possibility, adding that he was of the lineage of the Gothic kings, but so poor that he was a farmer. Modern genealogists make him a son of Tulga, a possibility sustained by the fact of his being a humble man of royal descent, since his father was deposed at a young age, and when his own sons were still infants. The most famous tradition, however, has him born and raised in Pujerra (or Buxarra as it was once called) in the M\u00e1laga Province, an Andalusian mountain village, nestled amid forests of chestnut trees, near the Genal river in southern Spain. The ruins of Molino de Capilla (Mill of the Chapel) are nearby, and close to which lay the village of Cenay, which some consider to be Wamba's actual birthplace. ===Kingship=== The Election of Wamba as King. Oil on canvas by Francisco de Paula Van Halen (1843) There are at least two legends associated with how Wamba became king. One begins with Wamba's father, king of the Visigoths, who in this story was also named Wamba. Two women of his court, a servant girl and a noble lady, became pregnant at the same time. To avoid a scandal that might implicate the king, both women fled the capital. They found their way to an Andalusian village that, because it was so well hidden in the forest, provided an ideal place for secret births. Both women brought forth boys, and they were placed in the care of a servant girl to be raised in the area. When the time came to groom a successor for the king, there seemed to be no suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: \"You are the rightful king and we must ask you to come with us to the palace.\" Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, \"I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root.\" The stick he carried was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid. A second legend is related by Charles Morris in Historical Tales, the Romance of Reality: Spanish (\"The Good King Wamba\"). In this version, instead of being a boy, Wamba was an old man in the village, and owned land and possessions there. The year was 672. > In those days, when a king died and left no son, the Goths elected a new > one, seeking their best and worthiest, and holding the election in the place > where the old king had died. It was in the little village of Gerticos, some > eight miles from the city of Valladolid, that King Recesuinto [a.k.a. > Recceswinth] had sought health and found death. Hither came the electors\u2014the > great nobles, the bishops, and the generals\u2014and here they debated who should > be king. . . . Saint Leo, declaring he had been given divine guidance, instructed the electors to seek out a husbandman named Wamba. So scouts were dispersed throughout the land until, at length, Wamba was found tilling one of his fields. \"Leave your plough in the furrow\", they said to him; \"nobler work awaits you. You have been elected king of Hispania.\" \"There is no nobler work\", answered Wamba. \"Seek elsewhere your monarch. I prefer to rule over my fields.\" The astonished heralds knew not what to make of this. To them the man who would not be king must be a saint\u2014or an idiot. They reasoned, begged, implored, until Wamba, anxious to get rid of them, said: \"I will accept the crown when the dry rod in my hand grows green again\u2014and not till then.\" After he thrust it into the ground, all were astonished to see it suddenly become a green plant with leaves growing out of the top. Heaven had decided the matter. So Wamba \"went with the heralds to the electoral congress\". Once there, however, he again tried to refuse the throne. At this, one of the Visigothic chieftains drew his sword and threatened to behead Wamba if he did not accept the crown. Wamba relented and consented. The legend of the stick thrust into the ground is also associated with the town of Guimar\u00e3es, southwest of Braga in the Costa Verde of Portugal (the northwest corner of the country). There, because Wamba never withdrew the stick afterwards, it is said it grew into an olive tree. Though the tree is now gone, the site is marked either by the monastery of Nossa Senhora da Oliveira (Our Lady of the Olive) or the Largo da Oliveira town square, each named for the legendary tree. ===Saint Giles=== In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, written for the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is recorded about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and N\u00eemes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused. Over time, however, because of the saint's fame as a sage and miracle worker, multitudes gathered at his cave. Around 674, Wamba built them a monastery. Giles became its first abbot. Soon a little town grew up there, known as Saint-Gilles-du-Gard. Because of this tradition, Giles became the patron saint of cripples, lepers, and nursing mothers. His emblem is an arrow. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes that the king in this story must have originally been a Frank, \"since the Franks had expelled the Visigoths from the neighbourhood of N\u00eemes almost a century and a half earlier\". ===Loss of the crown=== Charles Morris writes that, during Wamba's reign: The tonsuring of king Wamba by Joan Brull. Oil on canvas (1894) > One ambitious noble named Paul, who thought it would be an easy thing to > take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly that he did not > want it, rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. Wamba met him in > battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul expected nothing less > than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should > be shaved. A shaved or tonsured head was the mark of one who had assumed monastic orders, which meant the man \"could not serve as king or chieftain, but must spend the remainder of his days in seclusion as a monk\". Later an ambitious youth named Erwig, pursuing the overthrow of the king, administered a sleeping potion. While Wamba was under, Erwig shaved the crown of his head. As before, Gothic law was clear. Wamba could no longer be king. So he accepted this change and happily became a monk, abdicating the throne on October 14, 680, to live out the last seven years of his life in seclusion from the world (dying in 687). Erwig became king in his place. :Thus it was that Wamba the husbandman first became king and afterwards monk. In all his stations\u2014farmer, king, and monk\u2014he acquitted himself well and worthily, and his name has come down to us from the mists of time as one of those rare men of whom we know little, but all that little good. Ironically, it was Wamba's nephew, son of his sister Ariberga, Ergica, who married Erwig's daughter and became the new king at his father in law's death. == Bibliography == * Charles Julian Bishko, \"Portuguese Pactual Monasticism in the Eleventh Century: The Case of S\u00e3o Salvador De Vacari\u00e7a\", Estudos de Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal: Homenagen a A.H. de Oliveira Margues (Lisbon: Editorial Estampa, 1982). * Henry Bradley, The Goths: from the Earliest Times to the End of the Gothic Dominion in Spain, chapter 33.
