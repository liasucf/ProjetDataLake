The archipelago extends from the northwestern coast of Sigguup Nunaa peninsula in the south at approximately Nunavik, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schj\u00f8tt, 1992 to the southern end of Melville Bay () in the north at approximately .Upernavik Avannarleq, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schj\u00f8tt, 1992 == History == The archipelago belongs to the earliest-settled areas of Greenland, the first migrants arriving approximately 2.000 years B.C.E.greenland-guide.gl All southbound migrations of the Inuit passed through the area, leaving behind a trail of archeological sites. The early Saqqaq culture diminished in importance around 1.000 BCE, followed by the migrants of Dorset culture, who spread alongside the coast of Baffin Bay, being in turn displaced by the Thule people in the 13th and 14th centuries. The area has been continuously inhabited since then. Today the Upernavik Archipelago is sparsely populated, despite the relatively high number of settlements scattered across its entire length. All but one of these settlements are located on the islands.Upernavik, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schj\u00f8tt, 1992 Upernavik town is the largest settlement with 1,129 inhabitants as of 2010, formally founded in 1772 by the Danes during the colonization era. {| |- valign=\"top\" |Children of Upernavik town on their first day in class. |View of Upernavik in 1890. |} == Geography == The coastline of Greenland is deeply indented in this region, markedly different from that of the Nuussuaq BasinDe Nationale Geologiske Unders\u00f8gelser for Danmark og Gr\u00f8nland (GEUS) of Uummannaq Fjord and Nuussuaq Peninsula. In the northern part of the archipelago, the coastal mountains disappear altogether, with the Greenland ice sheet () reaching the sea level across nearly the entire length of the perennially frozen Melville Bay. ===Islands=== Nutaarmiut Island is the largest in the archipelago, followed by Maniitsoq and Qeqertaq. These are some of the islands of the group: Aappilattoq (Upernavik Icefjord) Aappilattoq (Tasiusaq Bay) Akia Akuliaruseq Amarortalik Amitsorsuaq Anarusuk Apparsuit Atilissuaq Aukarnersuaq Ateqanngitsorsuaq Horse Head Ikerasakassak Ikermoissuaq Ikermiut Illunnguit Innaarsuit Inussullissuaq Iperaq Itissaalik Kangaarsuk Karrat Kiatassuaq Kiataussaq Kingittorsuaq Kullorsuaq Maniitsoq Mattaangassut Mernoq Naajaat Nako Nasaussaq Nuluuk Nunaa Nunatarsuaq Nutaarmiut Nutaarmiut (Tasiusaq Bay) Nuuluk Paagussat Paornivik Puugutaa Qaarsorsuaq Qaarsorsuatsiaq Qallunaat Qaneq Qaqaarissorsuaq Qasse Qeqertaq Qeqertarsuaq (Kangerlussuaq Icefjord) Qeqertarsuaq (Nasaussap Saqqaa) Qeqertarsuaq (Upernavik Icefjord) Qullikorsuit Saarlia Saattoq Saattorsuaq Saattup Akia Sanningassoq Saqqarlersuaq Singarnaq- Annertussoq Sisuarsuit Sugar Loaf Taartoq Tasiusaq Timilersua Tukingassoq Tussaaq Tuttorqortooq Uigorlersuaq Uilortussoq Upernavik ===Settlements=== From north to south, the following are the towns and villages in the archipelago: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Settlement !!

In that, the northern region is culturally linked with the far north of Greenland, the Qaanaaq region. Outside of Upernavik town, the average level of income is amongst the lowest in Greenland. Four of the settlements in the archipelago (Naajaat, Nuussuaq, Kullorsuaq, and Upernavik Kujalleq) are listed in the top 10 poorest within Greenland.Sermitsiaq, 2009/04/17 == Transport == === Air === Air Greenland services the settlements with a Bell 212 helicopter The supply ship Vestlandia of Royal Arctic Line is the lifeline link for the archipelago Air Greenland operates government contract flights to nearly all villages in the Upernavik archipelago. These mostly cargo flights are not featured in the timetable of the airline, although they can be pre-booked. Departure times for these flights as specified during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimized on the fly depending on local demand for a given day. Upernavik is the only settlement with an airport. {|class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"22%\"|Settlement !! width=\"31%\"|Aerodrome !!

M/S Sarpik Ittuk\u2212which serviced Disko Bay, Uummannaq Fjord and Upernavik\u2212was sold in 2006 to Nova Cruising, a company from the Bahamas.inforMARE Since then the ferry services of AUL are available only southwards from Ilulissat, operated with the remaining ship, M/S Sarfaq Ittuk. Cargo/passenger boat Vestlandia of Royal Arctic Line links Upernavik with Uummannaq.RAL, Vestlandia schedule Tourism is very undeveloped, but charter boats for individual travellers and small groups are available in all settlements. == References == ==External links== * *1:1,000,000 scale Operational Navigation Chart, Sheet B-8 *Upernavik Tourism Category:Landforms of Baffin Bay Category:Archipelagoes of Greenland ",
