Anna Gaca of Pitchfork said \"Few R&B; albums have a pedal steel; few alt-country albums have a rap feature. Faye Webster's Atlanta Millionaires Club somehow has all of the above. Even stranger, she manages to smooth these apparent contradictions into serene folk-pop with a mellow soul tinge.\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Angie Martoccio noted that \"The 21-year-old's Atlanta roots allow her to effortlessly coalesce R&B; with indie-folk.\" ===Accolades=== ==Accolades== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
