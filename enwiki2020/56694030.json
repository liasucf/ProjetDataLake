According to some historic documents, Rei Emadir was \"a slave\" who avoided slavery and mobilized all the Angolares along with other Africans and made a free nation under the middle of the mentioned islands.Rei Amador. ==History of the origin of the Angolars== The Angolars inhabited the south of the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, there are different versions on the history . The first source on the Angolars, which were African slaves where brought from the mainland, probably from Angola who survived a shipwreck that happened about 2\u20133 miles (4 km) in the south coast of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island. Another version was that the Angolars were African slaves who had evaded their owners around 1470, when the Portuguese discovered the islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and have created their own free nation within the islands called Kilombo or Quilombo. The name Kilombo or Quilombo derives from (Kimbundo one of the most spoken Bantu languages in Angola), it can mean a settlement kingdom, population and union. Kilombo was an independent nation made by African slaves, who fought against slavery, once they fled, build their independent state with the system of slavery, The Kilombos, in general were localized in its regions densely forested, far from the plantations. A third version, was that the Angolars were Africans which were immigrated from the mainland to the islands of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, long before the arrivals of the Portuguese into the islands. However, the very particular remains inhistory of the Angolars and their reign in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are part of a history of self-determination and independence carried out by Rei Amador. ==Slave rebellion== On 9 July 1595, Rei Amador, and his people, the Angolars, allied with other enslaved Africans of its plantations, marched into the interior woods and battled against the Portuguese. It is said that day, Rei Amador and his followers raised a flag in front of the settlers and proclaimed Rei Amador as king of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, making himself as \"Rei Amador, liberator of all the black people\". Between 1595 and 1596, the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 was ruled by the Angolars, under the command of Rei Amador. On 4 January 1596, he was captured, sent to prison and was later executed by the Portuguese. Still today, they remember him fondly and consider him a national hero of the islands. ==Legacy== *In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, January 4 was declared a holiday in his honour, first celebrated in 2005. *A football (soccer) club known as UDRA is named after him.A Verdadeira Origem do C\u00e9lebre Rei Amador Gerhard Seibert of Espa\u00e7o Cultural STP *Rei Amador was depicted in a 5,000 dobras note.
