    "text": "Dead Man's Party is the fifth album by American new wave band Oingo Boingo, released in 1985. The album cover art is an homage to the Mexican holiday D\u00eda de Los Muertos. ==Music== The album features a different musical style than the band's previous releases, with a more pop-friendly production sound and dance arrangements. Elfman stated that he wrote the album's lead single, \"Weird Science,\" spontaneously in his car, after receiving a call from director John Hughes about composing a song for his upcoming film of the same name. The song went on to become the band's most commercially successful single, which Elfman later regretted, as he believed it \"just didn't feel like it was really a part of [the band's] repertoire.\"http://www.avclub.com/article/danny-elfman-oingo-boingo-film- scores-and-beatles--210856 ==In film and television== \"Just Another Day\" was featured as the opening theme for the 1985 film That Was Then... This Is Now.

The title track appears in the 1986 film Back to School, wherein the band performs the song live at a party.Dead Man's Party Songfacts It also appeared in the Chuck television series, in the episode \"Chuck Versus the Couch Lock\". \"No One Lives Forever\" appears within the opening minutes of two Cannon Group films: the 1986 production of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and the 1987 production of Down Twisted. It was later used in Casper: A Spirited Beginning (a 1997 direct-to-video release from 20th Century Fox and Saban Entertainment) and as the theme for the October 29, 2010 episode of Rachael Ray. The song \"Stay\" became a hit in Brazil and was used as the theme song for the Brazilian Telenovela Top Model, which increased the popularity of the band in that country and resulted in a Brazilian compilation album, Stay. It was also featured in Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut, as well as in the 2012 Australian film Any Questions for Ben?.
