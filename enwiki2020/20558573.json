The organisation is based in Toronto, Ontario, and feeds thousands of low-income people a year. They also provide valuable resources to the same demographic in order to find them financial assistance and support when needed. The Daily Bread Food Bank is the largest food bank in Canada and was founded in 1983. 80% of donations come from big companies, while the remaining 20% comes from the general public. The food bank works mostly on public donations, and donations from food companies, which are especially solicited around Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving. ==Events== Every year, Daily Bread is the beneficiary of hundreds of events and drives throughout the city organized by thousands of volunteers. ===HoHoTO=== HoHoTO, called \"the party that twitter built\", was one of the largest third-party community events in support of Daily Bread Food Bank. From 2008 to 2017, it was organized by Toronto's technology and media community as a party fundraiser and held each mid-December at the Virgin Mobile Mod Club. The event raised more than $250,000 for the Daily Bread in its first five years, as well as four tonnes of food. HoHoTO has been cited as an example of social action by Twitter co-founder, Biz Stone, BoingBoing co- founder Cory Doctorow, Queen Rania of Jordan, and was referenced as a case study in a business book. ==References== ==External links== * Official Daily Bread Food Bank website * Torontopedia.ca: Daily Bread Food Bank * Youtube.com: Daily Bread Food Bank Category:Food banks in Canada Category:Organizations based in Toronto Category:Religious organizations based in Canada Category:Organizations established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Ontario Category:Christian relief organizations ",
