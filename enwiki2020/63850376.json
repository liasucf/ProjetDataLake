Under this policy, for every franc spent on a project in Wallonia, a franc was also spent on a similar project in Flanders (and vice versa.) The social and linguistic divisions between Flanders and Wallonia meant that the coalition and compromise of waffle-iron politics helped to maintain peace. However, matching spending in one region with equal allocations to the other was costly and inefficient. Waffle-iron politics was a key cause of the Belgian national debt. In 1981, public debt amounted to 13% of GNP, among the highest in the European Union at the time. Waffle-iron politics also led to the creation of several (large useless works): misplaced or unnecessary public structures. One example is the bridges in Varsenare, two bridges built in 1976 that were never connected to a highway. The Dutch word literally translates to \"waffle-iron politics\" or \"waffle-iron policy\". The name is based on the idea that the waffle-iron leaves an identical impression on each side of the waffle. Both sides of the iron are necessary in order for the machine to function. Waffle- iron politics effectively came to an end in 1988 with the third state reform in Belgium. Belgium went from a unitary state to a federal one, giving each region more decision-making power. Flanders and Wallonia became responsible for their own spending, except in matters affecting the entire state. ==See also== * Politics of Belgium * Logrolling ==References== Category:Politics of Belgium Category:Political terminology Category:Public choice theory ",
