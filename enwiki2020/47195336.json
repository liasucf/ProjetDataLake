He heard the city's brass band parades in his neighborhood when he was a child; but it was the Beatles's famous Ed Sullivan appearance which inspired him to take up the guitar. At the early age of 12 he began performing with a high school-aged band The Sonics at The Wonderful Boys Club, a social and pleasure hall, and served as apprentice to many of the neighborhood's musicians. Recruited by former Jesuit High School classmates, LeBlanc received a scholarship to Columbia University where he studied Music Education. He would later graduate from Southern University of New Orleans, studying under the tutelage of Kidd Jordan, and move to Philadelphia to play with renowned jazz musician Sun Ra.Salaam, Kalamu Ya. \"Carl LeBlanc.\" Wavelength Magazine Jan. 1987: 15-16.
