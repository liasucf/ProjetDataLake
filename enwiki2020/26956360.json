After the quake, the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo was brought into the village of Almonte, where it remained for two years while a second hermitage was built.Los Traslados a lo Largo de la Historia, hermandadrociosevilla.com. Retrieved 2010-04-15. This second hermitage was restored in 1919 under the supervision of Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds de C\u00f3zar, but was demolished in 1963 to make way for the present structure. The present hermitage building was designed by architects Antonio Delgado y Roig and Alberto Balbont\u00edn de Orta. They presented their plan (in competition with two other proposals) in 1961; it was approved 24 May 1963. The statue of the Virgin was moved to Almonte 16 June 1963 in preparation for the demolition of the second hermitage, where demolition began in July. The cornerstone of the new building was laid 26 January 1964; a provisional chapel was constructed and in service 33 days later. Major construction continued until 10 January 1969, and after torrential rains prevented a planned benediction on 15 March, the benediction of the new hermitage took place 12 April 1969. However, even in 1969 the building was not complete in all respects, and some further construction, including the upper portion of the fa\u00e7ade, continued until 1980, when the cross was placed atop the building. The cross itself, by Sebasti\u00e1n Conde, dates from 1692, and was previously associated with the Barrio Santacruz in Seville.
