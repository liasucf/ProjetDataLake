    "text": "Spirou & Fantasio () is one of the most popular classic Franco-Belgian comics. The series, which has been running since 1938, shares many characteristics with other European humorous adventure comics like The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix. It has been written and drawn by a succession of artists. Spirou and Fantasio are the series' main characters, two adventurous journalists who run into fantastic adventures, aided by Spirou's pet squirrel Spip and their inventor friend the Count of Champignac. ==History== ===Origins of Spirou=== Rob-Vel's Spirou The comic strip was originally created by Rob-Vel for the launch of ' (Spirou magazine) on April 21, 1938, published by \u00c9ditions Dupuis. The main character was originally an elevator (lift) operator (in French: un groom) for the Moustique Hotel (in reference to the publisher's chief magazine, Le Moustique), and remained dressed in his red bellhop uniform for a long time after the occupation was dropped. Spirou (the name means \"squirrel\" (lit.) and \"mischievous\" (fig.) in Walloon) has a pet squirrel called Spip, the series' first supporting character, who was introduced on June 8, 1939 in the story arc titled L'H\u00e9ritage de Bill Money and liberated in the following week's issue, remaining a presence in all Spirou stories since. Spip's liberation, June 15, 1939 Adding to the difficulties of magazine publication that came with the outbreak of World War II, Velter joined the army effort, and his wife Blanche Dumoulin, using the pen name Davine, continued the work on the Spirou strip, with the aid of the young Belgian artist Luc Lafnet. Spirou became the property of the publisher Dupuis (atypical in France and Belgium where most comics characters are owned by their creator(s)), who bought the character from Rob-Vel in 1943, and since then the series has belonged to no specific author. The title has therefore subsequently been passed on to several different artists and writers. The first succession came in 1943 when Joseph Gillain, known by the pen name Jij\u00e9, was given charge of the character. In 1944 Jij\u00e9 introduced a new character, Fantasio, who would become Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer. Holding many artistic commitments at Spirou magazine, Jij\u00e9 sought to delegate much of his work, and in 1946 he handed the series to his understudy, the young Andr\u00e9 Franquin, in the middle of the production of the story Spirou et la maison pr\u00e9fabriqu\u00e9e. ===Franquin's Spirou=== Franquin developed the strip from single gags and short serials into long adventures with complex plots, and is usually considered as the definitive author of the strip. He introduced a large gallery of recurring characters, notably the Count de Champignac, elderly scientist and inventor; the buffoonish mad scientist Zorglub; Fantasio's cousin and aspiring dictator Zantafio; and the journalist Seccotine, a rare instance of a major female character in Franco-Belgian comics of this period. Spirou et les h\u00e9ritiers, 1952, by Franquin One Franquin creation that went on to develop a life of its own was the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail. The Marsupilami appears in the majority of the Franquin stories, starting in 1952 with Spirou et les h\u00e9ritiers. In the series, it is adopted by the duo and follows them everywhere they go. Marsupilamis in the wild take centre stage briefly in Le nid des Marsupilamis (1957) which presents Seccotine's documentary featuring a family in their natural habitat, the jungles of the fictitious South American state Palombia. Starting with Le prisonnier du Bouddha (1959), Franquin began to work with Greg (writing) and Jid\u00e9hem (backgrounds). As in some of his later series (Bruno Brazil, Bernard Prince), Greg staged his stories in a realistic geopolitical context. Le prisonnier du Bouddha is set in mainland China, with veiled references made to the Cold War. As for QRN sur Bretzelburg, it takes place in two imaginary European countries which bring to mind pre- reunification Germany. Lastly, it is with Greg that Franquin created famed villain Zorglub in the diptych of Z comme Zorglub and L'ombre du Z. However, as Franquin grew tired of Spirou, his other major character Gaston began to take precedence in his work, and following the controversial Panade \u00e0 Champignac, the series passed on to a then unknown young cartoonist, Jean- Claude Fournier, in 1969. One side effect of this is that the Marsupilami would only appear in one last story, Le faiseur d'or. This is because Franquin decided to retain the rights to that character; all the other characters remained the property of the publisher. Starting with Du glucose pour No\u00e9mie, there would be no more appearances of the Marsupilami in Spirou et Fantasio, with the exception of a few discreet references. Only in the 1980s did the Marsupilami reappear in its own series, and later television cartoon and videogame. ===A long transition=== Fournier authored nine books in the series, which saw Spirou evolve into a more modern character. Where Franquin's stories tended to be politically neutral (in his later works, notably Id\u00e9es noires, he would champion pacifist and environmental views), Fournier's stint on Spirou addressed such hot topics (for the 1970s) as nuclear energy (L'Ankou), drug- funded dictatorships (Kodo le tyran) and Duvalier-style repression (Tora Torapa). Fournier introduced some new characters such as Oror\u00e9a, a beautiful girl reporter with whom Fantasio was madly in love (in contrast with his dislike of Seccotine); Itoh Kata, a Japanese magician; and an occult SPECTRE- like criminal organisation known as The Triangle. None of these were reused by later artists until some thirty years later when Itoh Kata appeared in Morvan and Munuera's Spirou et Fantasio \u00e0 Tokyo. However, at the end of the 1970s Fournier's pace began to slow down and the publisher, Dupuis, sought new authors to replace him. For a time, three separate teams worked on concurrent stories. Nic Broca (art) and Raoul Cauvin (writing) took on Fournier's lead without adding much to the characters. Their primary addition to the Spirou universe, namely the \"Black box\", a device which annihilates sound, is in fact an acknowledged rehash from an early Sophie story by Jid\u00e9hem (La bulle du silence). Strangely, the authors were not allowed by the publisher to use any of the side characters and because of this, the duo's three stories read somewhat like a parenthesis in the series. ===Yves Chaland's case=== Yves Chaland proposed a far more radical make-over. His (very short) stint on Spirou is an ironic re-staging of the strip as it was in the 40s. This homage to Jij\u00e9 and early Franquin was seen at the time as too sophisticated for the mainstream readership. It was prepublished in 1982 in Spirou magazine, n\u00b02297 to n\u00b02318, printed in two-colour, but was interrupted before it was completed. This unfinished story was first collected in an unofficial album in 1984, \u00c0 la recherche de Bocongo, and then, legally, under the name of C\u0153urs d'acier (Champaka editor, 1990). This last edition includes the original strips, and a text by Yann Le Pennetier, illustrated by Chaland, that finishes the interrupted story.Included in L'int\u00e9grale Chaland (Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s, 1997. ), and Special Edition n\u00b04 (Dupuis ed.) ===Tome & Janry - The Dynamic Duo=== Vito la D\u00e9veine, 1991, by Tome & Janry It was the team of Tome (writing) and Janry (art) which was to find lasting success with Spirou, both in terms of sales and critical appeal. Graphically, the authors' work was seen as a modern homage to Franquin's classic work, while their plots involved such modern topics as biotech (Virus), robotics (Qui arr\u00eatera Cyanure?) and even time travel (the diptych of L'horloger de la com\u00e8te and Le r\u00e9veil du Z, featuring future descendants of the Count and Zorglub). Their position as the official Spirou authors made them the flagship team to a whole new school of young, likeminded artists, such as Didier Conrad, Bernard Hislaire or Frank Le Gall, who had illustrious careers of their own. For a time, Spirou also acted as a side character in Frank P\u00e9's short-lived absurd humor strip L'\u00c9lan (originally published in the weekly Spirou magazine). With La jeunesse de Spirou (1987), Tome and Janry set out to imagine Spirou's youth. This idea was later developed into a spin-off series, Le Petit Spirou (\"Young Spirou\"), which details the antics of the character as an elementary school boy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the Petit Spirou doesn't have very much in common, psychologically speaking, with the adult character. A new villain, the unlucky Mafia boss Vito \"Lucky\" Cortizone, based on the character Vito Corleone from The Godfather movies, was introduced in Spirou \u00e0 New-York, while Spirou \u00e0 Moscou (1990) sees Spirou and Fantasio pay their first visit to the USSR, just as it was about to collapse (the country was dissolved in 1991). In Machine qui r\u00eave (1998), Tome and Janry tried to once again renew the series with a more mature storyline (wounded hero, love relationships, etc.), coupled with a more realistic graphic style. This sudden shift into a darker tone shocked many readers, although its seeds were apparent in previous Spirou albums and in other series by the same authors (Soda, Berceuse assassine). While many considered the change in tone to be courageous and laudable, there was some concern that Spirou lost much of its point when presented as a \"realistic\" character. At any rate, the controversy caused Tome & Janry to concentrate on Le Petit Spirou, and stop making albums in the main series. ===Spirou in the 21st century=== Spirou mural in Brussels. ====Morvan & Munuera==== Then, after a 6 years break, which only saw the publication of L'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim not included in the official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and Jos\u00e9-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and not just from Franquin's period. The duo's third album, Spirou et Fantasio \u00e0 Tokyo was released 20 September 2006. Spirou and Fantasio uncover the story of two children with telekinetic powers (similarly to the manga Akira) that are forced to construct an edo and meiji period theme park. Dupuis has also released as Spirou et Fantasio 49Z a manga story by Hiroyuki Oshima after an idea by Morvan. This story tells Spirou's adolescence as a groom in a 5 star Tokyo hotel. Due to a significant decline in sales, Dupuis decided to cease Morvan and Munuera work in Spirou in January 2007.InediSpirou - Morvan & Munuera arr\u00eatent Spirou However, they were allowed to complete one last album, Aux sources du Z, which was released 5 November 2008, with the help of scenarist Yann. ====Yoann & Vehlmann==== In January 2009, it was announced in Spirou magazine #3694 that Morvan and Munuera would be succeeded by Fabien Vehlmann and Yoann, who had together created the first volume of Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par.... Their first album in the regular series was announced for October 2009,ToutenBD reports the new authors for Spirou (24 January 2009) but was later pushed back to September 3, 2010 and is named Alerte aux zorkons. ====Le Spirou de...==== In 2006, Dupuis launched a second series of one-off volumes by various authors, under the name Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par... (\"A Spirou and Fantasio adventure by...\"). It has subsequently been renamed \"Le Spirou de...\" (\"The Spirou story by...\") The first volume, Les g\u00e9ants p\u00e9trifi\u00e9s by Fabien Vehlmann and Yoann, had a modern storyline and art, not dissimilar in spirit to Morvan and Munuera's work. The second volume, Les marais du temps, by Frank Le Gall, is drawn in a more classic style not dissimilar to The Adventures of Tintin and Th\u00e9odore Poussin, Le Gall's own comic series. The third, Le tombeau des Champignac, by Yann and Fabrice Tarrin, is a slightly modernized homage to Franquin's classic period. The fourth, Journal d'un ing\u00e9nu, by Emile Bravo, is a novelistic homage to the original Rob-Vel and Jij\u00e9's universes and stories, and was released to critical acclaim, being awarded at the Angoul\u00eame festival. The fifth, Le groom vert-de-gris by Yann and Olivier Schwartz, is based on one of Yann's old scripts from the 80's originally intended to have been drawn by Chaland, while the editor rejected it. Yann picked up the artist Schwartz, working in a similar style, to complete the story. The story takes place among the resistance movement in the Nazi-occupied Belgium. Unlike traditional Spirou stories, but similar to other works by Yann, the story features rather much dark humour and political satire. It was released once again to some acclaim but also attracted controversy for its cavalier approach to sensitive issues. The sixth album, Panique en Atlantique, authored by Lewis Trondheim and Fabrice Parme, was released on April 16, 2010. ==Characters== Main and recurring Spirou et Fantasio characters: * Spirou - The main character. An investigative reporter with a strong sense of justice. * Fantasio - Spirou\u2019s best friend and co-adventurer, a reporter with a hot temper. * Spip - Spirou's grouchy pet squirrel. * The Marsupilami - A very unusual creature captured in a South-American jungle by Spirou and Fantasio. Marsupilami is the name of the species, and the creature never acquired an individual name. Often referred to as \"the little animal\" even though it can terrorise anything and anyone. * Count of Champignac - Spirou and Fantasio's eccentric scientist friend. * The Mayor of Champignac. Petty, pompous, ineffectual and two-faced, he is mostly memorable for his trademark speeches in which he piles up mixed metaphors sky- high. * Seccotine - Their fellow reporter, a friend and rival at the same time. Gets on Fantasio's nerves, but a priceless ally. * Gaston Lagaffe - The main source of disaster and gags at the Spirou magazine offices. While he is the hero of his own series, he makes a few guest appearances in Spirou stories. * Oror\u00e9a - Another brave female reporter, of Polynesian descent. * Itoh Kata - A Japanese scientist and magician. * Zorglub - A mad scientist as well as a former colleague of the Count of Champignac from university. Originally a foe upon his first appearance, he boasts that he could take over the world, but really wants to be recognised as the greatest scientist of all time. He later rehabilitates and becomes a friend of the protagonists. However, his ego is never shot down as more recent albums show. ===Enemies=== * Zantafio - Fantasio's evil cousin. * John Helena \"la Mur\u00e8ne\" (the moray) - A brutal maritime criminal. * Don Vito \"Lucky\" Cortizone - New York mafia boss, father of a dangerous woman called Luna. * Cyanure, a gynoid. ==Albums== This list includes French titles, their English translation, and the first year of publication ===Jij\u00e9=== * Spirou et l'aventure, 1948, featuring: **Le meeting a\u00e9rien (The Aerial Meeting), 1943 **Autour du monde avec le pilote rouge (Around the World with the Red Pilot), 1944 **Le voyage dans le temps (The Voyage in Time), 1944\u201345 **L'enl\u00e8vement de Spip (The Abduction of Spip), 1945 **La jeep de Fantasio (Fantasio's Jeep), 1945-46.
