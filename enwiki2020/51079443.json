    "text": "Yesshop (stylised as YESSHOP) was a New Zealand shopping channel. The channel was based on the South Korean model of home shopping. The channel originally launched in New Zealand on free-to-air television and pay television on 4 November 2013. The channel expanded to Australia via pay television provider Foxtel, launching on 29 February 2016, and later a short-lived run on regional free-to-air television via Southern Cross Austereo on 1 August 2016. Yesshop's owner, Yes Retail, made the decision to cease trading on 29 September 2016 citing lack of funds to pay wages and the company's current losses of approximately 20 million dollars. Employees' contracts were terminated the same day. == References == == External links == * Official website (archived site) Category:New Zealand television channels Category:2016 disestablishments in New Zealand Category:English-language television stations in New Zealand Category:English-language television stations in Australia Category:Home shopping television stations in Australia Category:Television channels and stations established in 2013 Category:Defunct New Zealand television channels Category:Defunct Australian television channels Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2016 ",
