Its national anthem is \"\u0160umbrat, Mordovija\" (Hail, Mordovia!) by Sergey Kinyakin and Nina Kosheleva, adopted in 1995. Mordovian folk music has become an inspiration for revivalist work of contemporary groups, such as Toorama and OYME. Bakich Vidiai is an Erzya pop singer. Among the traditional Mordvin musical instruments is the puvama, a double-chantered bagpipe.
