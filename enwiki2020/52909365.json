    "text": "Hah\u00f3t or Hah\u00f3t\u2013Buz\u00e1d (also Hoholt, Hadod or Hahold) was the name of a gens (Latin for \"clan\"; nemzets\u00e9g in Hungarian) in the Kingdom of Hungary, several prominent secular dignitaries came from this kindred. The last noble family, which originated from the kindred, became extinct in 1849. ==Origins== According to the fourteenth-century chronicle composition, the Hah\u00f3t kindred descended from the Counts of Orlam\u00fcnde, arriving to Hungary in the 1160s upon the invitation of Stephen III to help to defeat the rebelled Cs\u00e1k kindred. The first member of the clan was Hahold (Hah\u00f3t), who suppressed the rebellion with his soldiers. The chronicle says Stephen, who invited the Hah\u00f3ts, was a son of B\u00e9la II, which description fits to Stephen III's uncle, Anti-king Stephen IV. However both historians J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi and Elem\u00e9r M\u00e1lyusz argued, the Hah\u00f3ts took part in the defeat of the rebellious Stephen IV in 1163, who took assistance from some clans, includings Cs\u00e1ks, in addition to the Byzantine Empire. Historian Endre T\u00f3th considers the Hah\u00f3ts' settlement and defeating the Cs\u00e1ks as two separate events, and the latter one only marked the Hah\u00f3ts' first prominent presence in national politics. Simon of K\u00e9za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum referred to the Hah\u00f3t kindred as \"Buzad autem generatio de Mesn originem trahit, nobiles de districtu Wircburg\". Kar\u00e1csonyi identified Wircburg as Marburg in March of Styria (today Maribor, Slovenia), while Mesn was identical with the nearby Messendorf, he claimed. M\u00e1lyusz identified the two geographical names with Wartburg and Meissen in Thuringia (Margravate of Meissen), noting that none of them were part of the estates of the House of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde, which ruled Meissen from 1046 to 1067. Endre T\u00f3th tried to reconstruct the origin of the kindred based on the spread of the name Hahold in German-speaking areas. Near Freising, the name was relatively frequently used since the 8th century, in addition, it appeared altogether with the name Arnold in the 13th century, which was also used for four generations in the Hah\u00f3t kindred. ==Seats and possessions== Following Stephen III's victory, Hahold received land donations and settled down in Zala County near the Austrian border. By the 13th century, his kindred possessed the most extensive estate in the county, along the rivers Kerka and Ledava, and in Prekmurje (today in Slovenia). In the early period, the family seat was Hah\u00f3t, which was named after the kindred, between rivers Kanizsa and P\u00f6l\u00f6ske. In 1192, Hahold II bought lands in Als\u00f3lendva (today Lendava, Slovenia) and in the surrounding areas (Ven\u00e9ce). His brother Buz\u00e1d I was mentioned as a onetime owner of \u00dajudvar, also in Zala County, by a royal charter of B\u00e9la III of Hungary, when he donated the estate to the Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r monastery. Archaeologist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 V\u00e1ndor argued Hahold I was granted his coherent and extensive possession from a crown land after the cessation of the \"gyep\u0171\" border system. Accordingly, the Hah\u00f3ts' first lands were part of the so-called \"gyep\u0171elve\", a mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited area beyond the Austrian border, comparable to the modern buffer zones. V\u00e1ndor considered \u00dajudvar (Nova Curia), where stone buildings, churches, monasteries were excavated, was the centre of this territory until the donation. \u010cakovec in Croatia) By the 1230s, Buz\u00e1d I's son Arnold I founded the kindred's monastery at Hah\u00f3t, the namesake seat of his family, dedicated to Margaret of Antioch. Archaeologists argued the Hah\u00f3ts erected their monastery on a basis of a royal convent founded by Ladislaus I of Hungary. However, in fact, the Hah\u00f3t monastery was only a common burial place among the Hah\u00f3t clan, as its branches moved away from each other by then. In 1248, Michael I of the Hahold branch founded a Franciscan friary in Szemenye (today in Muraszemenye), also dedicated to Mary the Virgin. Later the B\u00e1nfi de Als\u00f3lendva family, descendants of the Hah\u00f3t kindred through his brother Hahold III, became patron of the monastery. One of the members of the more powerful Buz\u00e1d branch, Atyusz (or Cs\u00e1k I) erected a Premonstratensian monastery at Rajk around 1270. Possibly it was Arnold II of the Arnold branch who built the castles of P\u00f6l\u00f6ske and Sztrig\u00f3 (today \u0160trigova, Croatia) in Zala County in the 1240s, after B\u00e9la IV of Hungary abandoned the ancient royal prerogative to build and own castles in response to the Mongol invasion. After the 1270s the gradually marginalized Arnold branch, resided on the western part of the Hah\u00f3t basin, lost the ownership of P\u00f6l\u00f6ske and Sztrig\u00f3 against Ottokar II of Bohemia then the increasing powerful K\u0151szegi family. Nicholas III also owned Purbach () in Sopron County, but after his rebellion in 1270, Stephen V of Hungary confiscated the castle and donated to his loyal soldier Panyit Miskolc. Until confiscation, Nick was also a property of Panyit Hah\u00f3t. In Somogy County, the branch possessed Sukor\u00f3, M\u00f3richely, Oszi\u00e1gy, Surd and K\u00e1konya. For a time, James also owned K\u00e1lm\u00e1ncsa and Dobsza, formerly queenly estates. Als\u00f3lendva Castle (today Lendava in Slovenia) By 1251, sons of Blessed Buz\u00e1d (Buz\u00e1d branch) built their own timber fortifications \u2013 Buz\u00e1dtornya, Cs\u00e1ktornya, Teresty\u00e9ntornya and Lankr\u00e9dtornya (lit. Buz\u00e1d's Tower, Cs\u00e1k's Tower, Tristan's Tower and Lancelot's Tower, respectively). Among them only Cs\u00e1ktornya (today \u010cakovec, Croatia) survived the following centuries. Ottokar's army captured all castles in the early 1270s, causing the Buz\u00e1d branch's move into Center Zala. The eldest son Buz\u00e1d III also inherited Buz\u00e1dsziget and Szabar from his father who entered the Dominican Order. His son Atyusz resided in Szabar and thus became ancestor of the Szabari family. Cs\u00e1k I's branch settled down in Cs\u00e1ny after Ottokar's invasion \u2013 their descendants, the Cs\u00e1nyi family originated from there. After a praefectio in filium by his father Nicholas V in 1365, Klara, a descendant of Buz\u00e1d IV (son of Cs\u00e1k I) granted the village of Buz\u00e1dsziget, while its fort was already demolished by then. Following that Klara mortgaged the estate to her husband John Koltai and his brother George. Tristan's branch became extinct after a generation. Herbord, son of Lancelot, owned Falkos and S\u00f6jt\u00f6r, his descendants were frequently named after both villages. The Lancelot branch also owned Szombathely, Podturen, Belica among others once a long time ago. After his victorious unification war, Charles I of Hungary donated the liberated and formerly Hah\u00f3t-owned estates to the emerging Lackfi family. Descendants of the Buz\u00e1d branch (the Szabaris, Cs\u00e1nyis and S\u00f6jt\u00f6ris through the lineage of Buz\u00e1d III, Cs\u00e1k I and Lancelot, respectively) unsuccessfully attempted to regain their former possessions on the occasion of a lawsuit lasted from 1351 until 1376. Hahold IV of the Hahold branch called himself \"Lord of Als\u00f3lendva\" (today Lendava, Slovenia) in 1272, proving that he owned and possibly built the castle himself by then. The K\u0151szegis captured their castle around 1314, but Nicholas VII regained that in 1323. The Hahold branch owned villages and estates mostly the territory of today Slovenia. Nicholas VII received numerous land donations surrounding Als\u00f3lendva Castle, which became the domain of the B\u00e1nfi de Als\u00f3lendva family. ==Notable members== Hahold I :Ancestor and founder of the clan, a mercenary knight from Thuringia (possibly related to the Counts of Orlam\u00fcnde), who was invited by King Stephen III against his uncle, Stephen IV, who contested his realm in 1163. Hahold's army defeated the Cs\u00e1k forces, who fought for the rebellious anti-king. After the internal war, he received land donations (e.g. Hah\u00f3t, P\u00f6l\u00f6ske) and settled down in Zala County. According to 18th-century archivist J\u00e1nos Schenk, Hahold was granted the village of Lenti (Nempti) in 1172. Buz\u00e1d I (died 1192) :Son of Hahold I.

Being ancestor of the Hahold branch, he was mentioned as \"religiosus miles\" by the Chapter of Veszpr\u00e9m on the occasion of two property lawsuits, judged by Mog, Palatine of Hungary in 1192. This is the first source when a Palatine judged not only due special orders of the King, indicating that an independent palatinal judicial bench was established on a permanent basis. ===Arnold branch=== Arnold I (d. before 1234) :Son of Buz\u00e1d I.
