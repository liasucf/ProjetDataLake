    "text": "Jen Taylor Friedman is a soferet (Jewish ritual scribe). On September 9, 2007, she became the first woman known to have completed a Torah scroll. Taylor Friedman's sefer Torah was commissioned by United Hebrew Congregation, a Reform temple in St. Louis, Missouri. Taylor Friedman was born in Southampton, England, and educated at Oxford. While studying at Oxford, she became interested in halakha (Jewish law) and calligraphy, and by a \"chance combination of happy circumstances\" she met a sofer (a male scribe) who helped her realize that becoming a soferet would allow her to pursue both interests. Taylor Friedman continued her scribal studies in Jerusalem and New York City, where she now resides. Taylor Friedman's first project as a soferet was Megillat Esther, a scroll of the Biblical Book of Esther that is traditionally read in synagogue on the holiday of Purim. She completed the project on Purim 2004 (March 6). Since that time she has prepared six more megillot, including one for Congregation Ansche Chesed, a synagogue on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Friedman oversaw the work of scribes involved with the Women's Torah Project, completed in 2010. In May 2010 she completed her third Torah scroll for Congregation Dorshei Emet, the first synagogue in Canada and the third in the world to receive a Torah handwritten by a woman.\"Female scribe to pen Reconstructionist shul\u2019s new Torah\", Canadian Jewish News, May 21, 2009.\"Woman scribes history-making Torah\", CTV Montreal website, May 16, 2010. In 2018 she completed the first full Torah written in Texas by a woman. Austin's Congregation Agudas Achim requested her to do it for them. Taylor Friedman is one of a small, but growing, number of soferot (female scribes). Taylor Friedman is also known for her Tefillin Barbie, which has been featured in a number of prominent Jewish publications. ==References== ==Further reading== * Elissa Strauss, \"Women Who Write Torah: A New Generation of Female Scribes Makes History\", The Forward, November 19, 2010. ==External links== * Hasoferet.com Official website Category:American calligraphers Category:American Jews Category:English Jews Category:Jewish scribes (soferim) Category:Living people Category:Women calligraphers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
