    "text": "Scud (born 20 March 1967), is the professional name of Guangzhou, China-born Hong Kong film producer, screenwriter and film director, Danny Cheng Wan- Cheung (). He says that he chose the name \"Scud\" to match his Chinese name, which translates in English as \"Scudding Clouds\". His films explore somewhat taboo themes within Hong Kong cinema, including same-sex relationships and drug-taking. His film-making style eschews cynicism or gritty realism, and embraces an acceptance of the life choices made by his characters, rather than a search for \"solutions\". Scud has cited Pier Paolo Pasolini, Pedro Almodovar and Peter Greenaway as directors who have influenced his work. ==Life and career== Scud was raised by his grandmother in China before he moved to Hong Kong at the age of 13. After a 20-year career in IT, he founded a publicly listed company and acquired a bachelor's degree through part-time study at the Open University of Hong Kong. He moved to Australia in 2001 for permanent residence. In 2005, he returned to Hong Kong to start a film production company, Artwalker. He wrote and produced City Without Baseball (2008), then became a film director for Permanent Residence (2009), which he said was a semi-autobiographical account of his own life, with many scenes and locations providing a faithful account of it, followed by Amphetamine (2010). His fourth is Love Actually... Sucks! (2011), and the fifth, Voyage (2013), which is the first of his stories to be filmed almost entirely in English. The sixth is called Utopians (2015), and the seventh, Thirty Years of Adonis (2017), while Naked Nation, to be filmed mostly in China, awaits release. ==Filmography== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"30%\" |- !
