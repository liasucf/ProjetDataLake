    "text": "Ralph Ren\u00e9 (August 24, 1933 - December 10, 2008) was an American conspiracy theorist, small press publisher and inventor. Ren\u00e9 was a vocal proponent of certain Moon landing conspiracy theories. Ren\u00e9's last self-published work, a pamphlet he distributed called WTC Lies and Fairy Tales, details his assertions regarding certain 9/11 conspiracy theories. Ren\u00e9 appeared frequently in shows produced by The History Channel, National Geographic Channel, Fox television and Showtime. In one such show, The Truth Behind the Moon Landings: Stranger Than Fiction, journalist and former NASA employee James Oberg referred to Ren\u00e9 and other conspiracy theorists as cultural vandals. Ren\u00e9 reacted onscreen with amusement and stated that he liked the characterization. Ren\u00e9 was also featured in an episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit! covering conspiracy theories. Ren\u00e9 was introduced as a physicist on the 2001 Fox documentary, Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?, and had the designation \"Author/Scientist\" under his picture. However, Ren\u00e9 admitted in his biography that he did not hold a degree from any university and always referred to himself as \"self-taught.\" ==Moon landing conspiracy theories== His 1992 self-published book, NASA Mooned America!, details why he felt that the Apollo Moon landings were faked and actually produced from a closed studio. ==Other claims== In addition to contending that NASA never sent astronauts to the Moon, Ren\u00e9 also proposes a number of other ideas Ren\u00e9 outlined most of these beliefs in his self-published book, The Last Skeptic of Science (1995). The original title of the book, MENSA Lectures (1990), resulted in a lawsuit against him by Mensa who felt he was misappropriating the name of their organization and using it to suggest they backed his beliefs. ==Personal life== Ren\u00e9 referred to himself as an \"extra bright kid from the slums.\" After attending Rutgers University for a time, he dropped out and went to work as a carpenter and millwright. He then continued to pursue his personal interests in structural and mechanical engineering, physics, writing and inventing. Ren\u00e9 held two patents for simple mechanical tools. US patent issue date: March 4, 1980. US patent issue date: January 5, 1965. He maintained a website that archived many of his past columns and essays on a wide variety of subjects. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== ====Non-fiction==== * * * ====Fiction==== * * * * ===Pamphlets=== * * ==See also== *Astronauts Gone Wild *Bart Sibrel *Bill Kaysing *Squaring the circle ==References== ==External links== * Category:1933 births Category:2008 deaths Category:9/11 conspiracy theorists Category:Moon landing conspiracy theorists Category:American male writers Category:American conspiracy theorists ",
