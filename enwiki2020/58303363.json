    "text": "American Dharma is a 2018 British-American documentary film directed by Errol Morris. The film follows the career of political strategist Steve Bannon. The film was released on November 1, 2019, by Utopia. == Synopsis == American Dharma consists of a dialogue between documentary subject Steve Bannon and director Errol Morris focusing on Bannon's film-making, time as the executive chairman of Breitbart News, time as the chief executive of Donald Trump's 2016 United States Presidential campaign, time on the United States National Security Council for Trump's administration, and commentary on several films. The documentary is segmented into five sections: The Fog of #war, Honey Badgers, Angry Voices, What Have I Done?, and Go F#ck Yourself. Morris's documentary cuts together footage from Twelve O'Clock High, The Searchers, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Chimes at Midnight, The Candidate, In the Face of Evil: Reagan's War in Word and Deed, Generation Zero, My Darling Clementine, Paths of Glory and audio from The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara as Bannon addresses these films\u2019 effects on his perceptions and beliefs. The interview takes place on a set replicating the air-strip and Quonset hut from Twelve O'Clock High and they watch clips from these films on a projector out of frame. The documentary juxtaposes interview footage with related filmography, archival footage, and graphics displaying news headlines during the presidency and candidacy of Trump. == Production == Errol Morris cites his desire to understand the United States 2016 Presidential Election, \"So that we can try to make sure it doesn't happen again\", as inspiration for the film. The decision to interview Steve Bannon specifically was brought on by the filmmaker's reading of Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury. In an interview with WBUR-FM, Morris says that Bannon \"was flattered that I wanted to make a movie about him\". The films, including Twelve O'Clock High, The Searchers, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Chimes at Midnight, etc., served as a way for Morris to avoid Bannon's normal talking points. Morris first heard about Bannon's love of Twelve O'Clock High in Joshua Green's Devil's Bargain. Morris interviewed Bannon for five days between February and April in Boston. 15 to 16 hours of footage was recorded during the interviews. Cut footage from the film made use of Morris's interrotron device, which allows for both first person perspective and eye contact between the interviewer and the subject. Morris decided not to use the interrotron, \"very late in the game\". During the Lawfare Podcast, Morris cites his fatigue with the use of the interrotron and desire to do something different and more adversarial as reasons for the change. The Quonset hut used as a set for the interview was constructed for American Dharma as a replica of the set in Twelve O'Clock High. The set was constructed on top of an abandoned airfield. According to the director, \"He [Bannon] loved walking through the set.\" The film's penultimate shot, wherein the Quonset hut has burned to the ground, was captured using a drone. Bannon was not dressed by the crew; it was his choice to wear three shirts on set. During the filming, Bannon was reading a book on the Great Wall of China. In post-production, Morris showed Bannon 20 minute cuts of the film, but retained decision making on the final cut. The film was nearly titled \"American Carnage\" after Donald Trump's inaugural address. == Soundtrack == Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack includes tracks with titles in line with key notes from American Dharma. \"Charlottesville\" is named after the city in Virginia where the Unite the Right rally occurred in 2017. \"American Carnage\" is named in reference to Trump's 2016 inauguration speech, wherein the phrase \"American Carnage\" was employed to describe the United States in an apocalyptic frame. Tracks such as \"Andrew Breitbart\", \"Comey\", and \"Mueller\" denote Andrew Breitbart, James Comey, and Robert Mueller respectively as figures that, while not interviewed by Errol Morris, appear prominently in archival footage. Tracks \"Falstaff\", \"Paradise Lost\", and \"The Bridge\" recall Chimes at Midnight, Paradise Lost, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. Each aforementioned media form appears prominently within the documentary as Steve Bannon discusses his interpretations of these works. === Track listing === American Dharma (2018) by Errol Morris ==Release== American Dharma premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2018 in the \"out of competition\" category.
