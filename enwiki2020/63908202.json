    "text": "The Indian FTR1200 is an American motorcycle manufactured by Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company since 2019. The Indian Scout FTR750 flat track racing motorcycle is similar in appearance. The FTR1200 and its derivative, the FTR1200S, have been noted as having design cues from the sport of flat track racing, including the airbox location, dual exhaust pipes, lightweight appearance, in contradistinction to the usual American cruiser motorcycle, and \"directly target[s] enthusiast riders who currently have traditionally favored the Ducati Monster, Triumph Speed Triple and BMW R nineT\". The \"sport\" model FTR1200S has electronic electronic stability control, and wheelie control, with gyroscopic input to the ABS and other systems to make them lean sensitive. ==References== ==External links== * FTR1200 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2019 Category:Standard motorcycles Category:American motorcycles ",
