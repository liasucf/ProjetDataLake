Driggs-Schroeder was the name of several naval guns designed by US Navy officers William H. Driggs and Seaton Schroeder for the United States Navy in the late 1880s, fitted on ships built in the 1890s. Some Driggs-Schroeder weapons were also adopted by the US Army. Driggs later founded the Driggs-Seabury Ordnance Company in 1897, in partnership with his brother Louis Labadie \"L. L.\" Driggs and Samuel Seabury, a retired US Navy officer.Patent assigned by William Hale Driggs in 1906 to Driggs-Seabury Ordnance Corp.

They were among numerous models of these guns equipped on US Navy ships of the 1890s. Unlike some other manufacturers, Driggs-Schroeder did not design fully automatic 1-pounder and 3-pounder guns. Most Driggs-Schroeder weapons were manufactured by the American Ordnance Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut,American Ordnance, frontispiece with some manufactured by Driggs Ordnance Company.Executive Documents of the House of Representatives, 1889-90, Washington: Government Printing Office, pp. 440-441DiGiulian, Tony US 1-pounder guns Mks 1-15DiGiulian, Tony US 3-pounder guns Mks 1-12DiGiulian, Tony US 6-pounder guns Mks 1-13 Breech of a Driggs-Schroeder 6-pounder gun on USS Olympia.

Olympia is preserved with her Driggs-Schroeder 6-pounders intact at the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Driggs-Schroeder designed a \"limited recoil\" carriage for the US Army's 3.2-inch gun M1890, along with a 3.2-inch field gun based on that weapon with a different breech.American Ordnance, pp. 42, 49\u201352 These were perhaps the same gun and/or carriage later prototyped by Driggs- Seabury; neither was adopted by the US Army.Blueprint for a Driggs-Schroeder 3.2-inch gun from Winchester Repeating Arms Company, at the Buffalo Bill Center of the WestScientific American, Vol. 79, Issue 6, article on the 3.2-inch Driggs-Seabury field gun A 12-pounder gun on a limited recoil carriage for naval landing forces was submitted to the US Army Ordnance Department in fiscal year 1895; it was not adopted.American Ordnance, pp. 39\u201342, 49\u201352 An Army 4-inch/40 caliber Driggs-Schroeder rapid-fire gun also existed,American Ordnance, pp. 42\u201344 probably the same as one of several Navy guns of this type.

These included experimental quantities on \"parapet mounts\", wheeled carriages with fittings that allowed them to be secured to pintle mounts set in concrete. A dozen were deployed at Fort Ruger in Hawaii as part of the Land Defense Project of 1915, along with some in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays, Philippines.Berhow, pp. 188-189, 217 ==References== * * * * Munsey's Magazine Volume XXVI, October 1901 to March 1902, p. 880\\.
