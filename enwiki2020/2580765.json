The community is located south of Springfield on West Virginia Route 28 at Hanging Rocks along the South Branch Potomac River. Wappocomo has also historically been referred to as The Rocks, Wapocoma, and Wapocomo. The community's name comes from the Native Americans of the area, Wappocomo meaning South Branch Potomac River in the local Indian language. Wappocomo has become a popular location on the South Branch for summer campsites with both locals and out-of-state visitors.
