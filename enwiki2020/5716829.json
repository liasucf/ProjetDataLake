Tarigo V\u00e1zquez (Montevideo, 15 September 1927 \u2013 14 December 2002) was a Uruguayan jurist and political figure. ==Background== He was a lawyer and University professor. ==Vice President of Uruguay== He was Vice President of Uruguay from 1985 to 1990, in the first period of democratic government after the civilian-military administration of 1973\u20131985, serving under President Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti. A notable feature of his appointment to office was that the Vice Presidency had been vacant since the resignation of Vice President Jorge Sapelli in 1973. He served also the President of the Senate of Uruguay. Tarigo was one of the most important persons in the movement to obtain the exit of the civilian-military government. ===Succession=== Tarigo was succeeded as Vice President in 1990 by Gonzalo Aguirre. ===Historical note=== Tarigo was the ninth person to hold the office of Vice President of Uruguay. The office dates from 1934, when Alfredo Navarro became Uruguay's first Vice President. With Tarigo as running mate, Sanguinetti agreed to revive the office of Vice President, despite the fact that the last Vice President of Uruguay had in practical terms caused the office to go into abeyance when he publicly repudiated sitting President Bordaberry (whom Sanguinetti had also served as a minister, and with whom he dissented on issues relating to the civilian-military government of 1973-1985). ===Death=== Tarigo passed away in 2002, victim of cancer. ==References== ==See also== * Politics of Uruguay ==External links== Category:1927 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Uruguayan people of Italian descent Category:Vice Presidents of Uruguay Category:Presidents of the Senate of Uruguay Category:Uruguayan vice-presidential candidates Category:Politicians from Montevideo Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) alumni Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) faculty Category:Uruguayan jurists Category:Ambassadors of Uruguay to Spain Category:Deaths from cancer in Uruguay ",
