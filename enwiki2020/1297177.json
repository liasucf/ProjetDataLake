    "text": "The doina () is a Romanian musical tune style, possibly with Middle Eastern roots, customary in Romanian peasant music, as well as in L\u0103ut\u0103reasc\u0103. It was also adopted into klezmer music.The Jews of North America Similar tunes are found throughout Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In some parts of the Balkans this kind of music is referred to as or . ==Origins and characteristics== B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k discovered the doina in Northern Transylvania in 1912 and he believed it to be uniquely Romanian. After he found similar genres in Ukraine, Albania, Algeria, Middle East and Northern India, he came to the belief that these are part of a family of related genres of Arabo-Persian origin.B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Essays He particularly linked the Romanian doina to the Turkish/Arabic Makam system. Bart\u00f3k's conclusions were rejected by some Romanian ethnomusicologists, who accused Bart\u00f3k of anti-Romanian bias. Nevertheless, the similarities between the Romanian doina and various musical forms from the Middle East have been subsequently documented by both non-RomanianThe Romanian Doina and RomanianHora lunga (doina, cantec lung)World Library Of Folk And Primitive Music Vol 17: Romania - Linear Notes by Speran\u021ba R\u0103dulescu scholars. Until the first half of the 20th century, both l\u0103utari and klezmer musiciansStacy Phillips - Klezmer collection for C instruments were recorded using a taksim as an introduction to a tune. The taksim would be later replaced by the doina, which has been described as being similar, though not totally identical to the taksim. Romanian ethnomusicologist and musician Grigore Le\u015fe, after performing with a group of Iranian musicians, noticed that the doinas of Maramure\u015f have \"great affinities\" with the Arabo-Persian music.Interview with Grigore Le\u015fe The doina is a free-rhythm, highly ornamented (usually melismatic), improvisational tune.Peter van der Merwe - Origins of the Popular Style The improvisation is done on a more or less fixed pattern (usually a descending one), by stretching the notes in a rubato-like manner, according to the performer's mood and imagination. Usually the prolonged notes are the fourth or fifth above the floor note. The peasant doinas are mostly vocal and monophonic and are sung with some vocal peculiarities that vary from place to place: interjections (m\u0103i, hei, dui-dui, iuhu), glottal clucking sounds, choked sobbing effects, etc. Instrumental doinas are played on simple instruments, usually various types of flutes, or even on rudimentary ones, such as a leaf. The peasant doina is a non-ceremonial type of song and is generally sung in solitude, having an important psychological action: to \"ease one's soul\" (de st\u00e2mp\u0103rare in Romanian). Grigore Le\u015fe believes that, while scholars describe in great detail the technical aspects of the doina, they fail to understand its psychological aspects. Doinas are lyrical in aspect and their common themes are melancholy, longing (dor), erotic feelings, love for nature, complaints about the bitterness of life or invocations to God to help ease pain, etc. Unlike peasant doinas, l\u0103utar and klezmer doinas are usually accompanied and played on more complex instruments (violin, pan-pipe, cymbalom, accordion, clarinet, tarogato, etc.). Also, unlike peasant doinas, l\u0103utar and klezmer doinas are mostly played as an introduction to another tune, usually a dance. In the regions of Southern Romania, Romani l\u0103utari developed a type of doina called c\u00e2ntec de ascultare (meaning \"song for listening\", sometimes shortened to de ascultare or simply ascultare). The c\u00e2ntec de ascultare spread to other regions of Romania, with local particularities. ==Etymology== Before being studied by ethnomusicologists, the doina type of song was known by many names varying from region to region throughout Romania and Moldova, doina being one of them. It was Constantin Br\u0103iloiu, director of the National Archive of Folk Music, who proposed that the word doina be used to describe all these songs. The origin of the word doina is unknown. It could be an old Indo-European term, since a similar form (daina) can be found in Latvia and Lithuania with the meaning of \"folk song\". Dimitrie Cantemir mentions Doina in his Descriptio Moldaviae among a series of old pre-Christian (Dacian) deities, persistent in popular oral tradition, adding that Doina, Doina is a starting phrase incantation in many folk songs. In the region of Maramure\u015f the word hor\u0103/hore is still the most commonly used; it is a Romanian word which translates into \"shepherd's lament\" or \"shepherd's longing\", which helps explain why doinas can be very melancholy, but have melodies that are rather poignant and heartfelt. The Maramure\u015f hor\u0103/hore is not related to the word hor\u0103 found in southern and eastern Romania, which comes from the Greek choros, meaning \"(circle) dance\" and is derived from the Latin oro/orare, meaning \"to say/saying\". ==Types of doina== *Hora lung\u0103 - Maramure\u015f. *Ca pe lunc\u0103 - found along the Danube. *Oltului - found along the Olt River. *De codru - codru means \"forest\". *Haiduce\u015fti (c\u00e2ntece haiduce\u015fti, C\u00e2ntece de haiducie) - \"haiduc's songs\" haiduc means \"outlaw\" or \"brigand\". *Ca din tulnic - unique type in which the melody imitates a type of Alpenhorn called the tulnic. *Ciobanului - shepherd's doina. *De dragoste - popular form, usually about love; dragoste means \"love\". *De jale - mellow, mournful doina; jale means \"grief\". *De leag\u0103n - a lullaby; leag\u0103n means \"cradle\". *De pahar - drinking song; pahar means \"drinking glass\". *Foaie verde - classical form; literally \"green leaf\". *Klezmer - played by Jewish musicians from Bessarabia and Moldavia. ==Current status== While at the beginning of the 20th century, the doina was the most common type of peasant song (in some areas the only type), today it has almost completely disappeared from peasant life, as most peasant music has. This process has been accentuated during the communist era, with the rise of the new, so-called \"popular music\", bringing a new style of performance that diluted the peasant styles. The doina is still, however, common in the repertoire of the l\u0103utari from Ardeal and Banat regions. In 1976 Gheorge Zamfir found popular success in the English-speaking world when the BBC religious television programme The Light of Experience adopted his recording of \"Doina De Jale\" as its theme. Popular demand forced Epic Records to release the tune as a single and it climbed to number four in the UK charts. In 2009 the doina has been included in the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. ==References== Category:Romanian music Category:Moldovan music Category:Klezmer Category:Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity ",
