    "text": "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is an 1868 novel by French writer \u00c9mile Zola, first published in serial form in the literary magazine L'Artiste in 1867. It was Zola's third novel, though the first to earn wide fame. The novel's adultery and murder were considered scandalous and famously described as \"putrid\" in a review in the newspaper Le Figaro. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin tells the story of a young woman, unhappily married to her first cousin by an overbearing aunt, who may seem to be well-intentioned but in many ways is deeply selfish. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's husband, Camille, is sickly and egocentric and when the opportunity arises, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se enters into a turbulent and sordidly passionate affair with one of Camille's friends, Laurent. In his preface, Zola explains that his goal in this novel was to \"study temperaments and not characters\".Zola, \u00c9mile. \"Pr\u00e9face de la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9dition.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin. Paris: Livre de Poche, 1997. Because of this detached and scientific approach, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is considered an example of naturalism. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin was first adapted for the stage as an 1873 play written by Zola himself. It has since then been adapted numerous times as films, TV mini-series, musicals and an opera, among others. ==Plot summary== Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is the daughter of a French sea-captain and an Algerian mother. After her mother's death, her father takes her to live with her aunt, Madame Raquin, and Camille, her valetudinarian son. Because her son is \"so ill\", Madame Raquin dotes on him to the point of spoiling him, and he is very selfish. Camille and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se grow up side-by-side and Madame Raquin marries them to each other when Th\u00e9r\u00e8se turns 21. Shortly thereafter, Camille decides that the family should move to Paris so he can pursue a career. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Madame Raquin set up shop in the Passage du Pont Neuf to support Camille while he searches for a job. He eventually starts working for the Orl\u00e9ans Railway Company, where he runs into a childhood friend, Laurent. Laurent visits the Raquins and, while painting a portrait of Camille, contemplates an affair with the lonely Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, mostly because he cannot afford prostitutes anymore. It soon becomes a torrid love affair. They meet regularly and secretly in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's room. After some time, Laurent's boss no longer allows him to leave early, so the lovers must think of something new. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se comes up with the idea of killing Camille, and they become infatuated with the idea of being able to be together permanently while being married. It seems Camille is the only obstacle in this. They eventually drown him during a boat trip, though in defending himself Camille succeeds in biting Laurent on the neck. Madame Raquin is in shock after hearing of her son's disappearance. Everybody believes that the drowning was an accident and that the couple actually tried to save Camille. Laurent is still uncertain about whether Camille is truly dead and frequently visits the mortuary, which he persists in although it disturbs him, until he finally finds the dead body there. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se becomes far more nervous and has nightmares; the previously calm and centered Laurent also becomes nervous. Their feelings toward each other are greatly changing, but they still plot to marry without raising suspicion and therefore reap the rewards of their actions. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se acts very subdued around family and acquaintances and Laurent publicly shows great concern and care for her, so Michaud, one of the family's regular visitors, decides that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se should remarry and her ideal husband should be Laurent. They finally marry but they're haunted by the memory of the murder; Laurent's bite scar serves as a constant reminder for them both. They have hallucinations of the dead Camille in their bed every night, preventing them from touching each other and quickly driving them even more insane. They vacillate between trying desperately to rekindle their passion to get rid of the corpse hallucinations (and trying to 'heal' the bite scar), and despising each other. Laurent, previously an untalented artist, is suddenly struck with surprising talent and skill, but he can no longer paint a picture (even a landscape) which does not in some way resemble the dead man. Sickened by this, he gives up art. They must also tend Madame Raquin, who suffered a stroke after Camille's death. She suffers a second stroke and becomes completely paralyzed (except for her eyes), after which Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent accidentally reveal the murder in her presence during one of their many arguments. Madame Raquin, previously blissfully happy, is now filled with rage, disgust and horror. During an evening game of dominoes with friends, Madame Raquin manages to move her finger with an extreme effort of will to trace words on the table: \" ...\". The complete sentence was intended to be \"\" (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent killed Camille). At this point her strength gives out and the words are interpreted as \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent look after me very well\". Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent find life together intolerable. Laurent has started beating Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, something she deliberately provokes in order to distract her from her life. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se has convinced herself that Madame Raquin has forgiven her and spends hours kissing her and praying at the disabled woman's feet. The couple argue almost constantly about Camille and who was responsible for his death, so they exist in an endless waking nightmare. They are being driven to rashly plot to murder each other. At the novel's climax, they're about to kill each other when each realizes the other's plan. They break down sobbing in silent agreement of what they should do next, and reflect on their miserable lives. After a final embrace, they commit suicide by taking poison supplied by Laurent, all in front of the hate- filled, watchful gaze of Madame Raquin. ==Characters== * Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin \u2013 the eponymous protagonist, is the wife of Camille and the orphaned daughter of Madame Raquin's brother and an unknown African woman. * Camille Raquin \u2013 Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's husband and first cousin. * Madame Raquin \u2013 Camille's mother and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's aunt. She works as a shopkeeper to support her family. * Laurent LeClaire \u2013 a childhood friend and coworker of Camille who seduces Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. * Michaud \u2013 the police commissioner and friend of Madame Raquin * Olivier \u2013 Michaud's son who works at the police prefecture * Suzanne \u2013 Olivier's wife * Grivet \u2013 an elderly employee of the Orl\u00e9ans Railroad Company, where Camille works * Fran\u00e7ois \u2013 the Raquins' cat ==Themes== ===Punishment and imprisonment=== Throughout the book there are references to chains, cages, tombs and pits. These contribute to the impression that Laurent and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se are in a state of remorse and are plagued by guilt. The book mentions how they are always clawing at the chains that bound them together. The shop that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se owns is compared to a tomb, where Th\u00e9r\u00e8se watches corpses walk by in the day. ===Temperaments=== In his preface to the second edition, Zola writes that he intended to \"study temperaments and not characters\". To his main characters, he assigns various humors according to Galen's four temperaments: Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is melancholic, Laurent is sanguine, Camille is phlegmatic and Madame is choleric. For Zola, the interactions of these types of personalities could only have the result that plays out in his plot. ===Human beast=== Also in his preface, Zola calls both Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent \"human brutes\" and the characters are often given animal tendencies. Zola would take up this idea again in his La B\u00eate humaine (1890). ==Literary significance and reception== Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is generally considered to be Zola's first major work. Upon its release in 1867, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin was a commercial and artistic success for Zola; this led to a reprint in book form in 1868. It gained additional publicity when critic Louis Ulbach (pen name: Ferragus) called Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin \"putrid\" in a long diatribe for Le Figaro; Zola capitalized on this for publicity and referred to it in his preface to the second edition.Ferragus. \"La litt\u00e9rature putride.\" Le Figaro, January 23, 1868. ==Adaptations== ===Theatrical=== Zola adapted the novel into a play, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin, first staged in 1873. It was not performed in London until 1891, under the auspices of the Independent Theatre Society, since the Lord Chamberlain's Office refused to license it. Stage productions of Zola's play include: * 2006 for the Royal National Theatre, London, adaptation written by Nicholas Wright * 2007 production of the Nicholas Wright adaptation by Quantum Theatre in Pittsburgh; staged in the empty swimming pool of the Carnegie Free Library of Braddock * 2008 production at Riverside Studios, London, adaptation by Pauline McLynn * 2009 production at Edinburgh Fringe Festival performed by pupils of the Cheltenham Ladies' College (adapted by Fiona Ross) * 2014 production touring from Bath, adapted by Helen Edmundson * 2014 production at Theatre Works, Melbourne, Australia; adapted and directed by Gary Abrahams * 2015 Edmundson adaptation at the Roundabout Theater at Studio 54 (New York City)Raquin at the Roundabout * 2017 revival of the 2014 Gary Abrahams adaption touring Australia nationally An opera based on the novel was written by the composer Michael Finnissy. Another opera, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin, by Tobias Picker, opened in 2000. The novel was made into the Broadway musical Thou Shalt Not, with music by Harry Connick Jr.. The play The Artificial Jungle by Charles Ludlam was an adaption of the novel, written in the hard-boiled crime style of James M. Cain. Neal Bell adapted the novel into a play under the same title. It was first produced at New York University by Playwrights Horizons Theatre School on December 3, 1991, directed by Edward Elefterion, with Katie Bainbridge as the title role.
