    "text": "Diphenylphosphine oxide is an organophosphorus compound with the formula (C6H5)2P(O)H. It is a white solid that soluble in polar organic solvents. The compound is used in Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reactions to introduce a diphenylphosphino substituent.Jeffrey O. Saunders, Zheng Wang, Kuiling Ding \"Diphenylphosphine Oxide\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Analogous to the behavior of phosphorous acid, diphenylphosphine oxide exists in equilibrium with a minor tautomer hydroxydiphenylphosphine (CAS#24630-80-6) (C6H5)2POH. ==Synthesis== Diphenylphosphine oxide can be prepared by the reaction of phosphonic esters, such as diethylphosphite, with Grignard reagents. Alternatively, it may be prepared by the partial hydrolysis of chlorodiphenylphosphine or diphenylphosphine. ==Reactions== Organophosphinous acids are deoxygenated with DIBAH. The resulting secondary phosphines are precursors to phosphine ligands. ==References== Category:Organophosphine oxides Category:Phenyl compounds ",
