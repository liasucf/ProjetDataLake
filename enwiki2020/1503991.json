    "text": "The Best of Sade is the first greatest hits album by English band Sade. It was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 1994 and in the United States on 4 November 1994 by Epic Records. The Best of Sade chronicles Sade's first four albums, while also including non-single songs \"Jezebel\", \"Like a Tattoo\" and \"Pearls\", as well as \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\", which appeared in the soundtrack for the film Philadelphia. The album was digitally remastered in 2000. The singles from Diamond Life, as well as Stronger Than Prides \"Paradise\" and \"Nothing Can Come Between Us\", are presented in their 7\u2033 edit forms; \"Never as Good as the First Time\" and \"Cherish the Day\" are remixes produced by Sade, also taken from their respective singles. None of this information is listed within the packaging. ==Critical reception== AllMusic's Jason Elias wrote, \"By the time this was released in 1994, something unexpected happened. Sade's early work became classic and the later additions boasted even better vocals and songs that nicely improved on the theme. The timeless sound and class always exhibited makes Sade Adu and her band a no- brainer for an appealing compilation. Like Al Green's Greatest Hits, The Best of Sade doesn't detract from the original albums and is a marker of time, not the end of the act... Despite its riches, The Best of Sade doesn't include all of the best, since 'Maureen' and or 'Keep Looking' aren't here. It's a small complaint and The Best of Sade is a great overview.\" Robert Christgau called the album \"another loungecore alternative\". ==Track listing== Notes * signifies a co-producer ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Best of Sade. ===Sade=== * Sade \u2013 arrangement * Sade Adu \u2013 vocals * Andrew Hale \u2013 keyboards * Stuart Matthewman \u2013 guitar, saxophone * Paul S.
