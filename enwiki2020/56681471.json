    "text": "5\u03b1-Dihydrolevonorgestrel (5\u03b1-DHLNG) is an active metabolite of the progestin levonorgestrel which is formed by 5\u03b1-reductase. It has about one-third of the affinity of levonorgestrel for the progesterone receptor. In contrast to levonorgestrel, the compound has both progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity, and hence has a selective progesterone receptor modulator-like profile of activity. This is analogous to the case of norethisterone and 5\u03b1-dihydronorethisterone. In addition to the progesterone receptor, 5\u03b1-DHLNG interacts with the androgen receptor. It has similar affinity for the androgen receptor relative to levonorgestrel (34.3% of that of metribolone for levonorgestrel and 38.0% of that of metribolone for 5\u03b1-DHLNG), and has androgenic effects similarly to levonorgestrel and testosterone. 5\u03b1-DHLNG is further transformed into 3\u03b1,5\u03b1- and 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-, which bind weakly to the estrogen receptor (0.4 to 2.4% of the of ) and have weak estrogenic activity. These metabolites are considered to be responsible for the weak estrogenic activity of high doses of levonorgestrel. ==See also== * 5\u03b1-Dihydronorethisterone * 5\u03b1-Dihydroethisterone * 5\u03b1-Dihydronandrolone * 5\u03b1-Dihydronormethandrone ==References== Category:5\u03b1-Reduced steroid metabolites Category:1-Ethynylcyclopentanols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Enantiopure drugs Category:Estranes Category:Human drug metabolites Category:Ketones Category:Selective progesterone receptor modulators Category:Synthetic estrogens ",
