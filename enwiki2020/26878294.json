Stone stele records of imperial examinations of the L\u00ea and M\u1ea1c dynasties () is a collection of 82 stone stelae that contain the names and related information of doctoral laureates who passed the imperial examinations during the reign of the L\u00ea and M\u1ea1c dynasties from 1442 to 1779. Preserved in good condition in the Temple of Literature of Hanoi, Vietnam, the collection became an inscription of the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme on March 9, 2010. ==Description== The 82 stelae were made from stone in the form of tortoise-mounted tablet since tortoise was traditionally considered a symbol of longevity and everlastingness in Vietnamese culture. There are three principal types of stele corresponding with three different periods of the L\u00ea and M\u1ea1c dynasties, besides each stele was decorated with diverse patterns from Taoist-influenced design to everyday images such as farmer or animals. According to the researcher Nguy\u1ec5n Vinh Ph\u00fac, there is possibly an 83rd stele in the collection since people discovered a stone tortoise at the bottom of the lake in the Temple of Literature. After each examination, a new stele was erected with detailed information about the process of the examination, number of participants and profiles of all laureates. Besides, engraved in each stele is a statement describing the meaning of education and talent for the country and reflecting the Confucian philosophy and tradition of Vietnam. This public recognition of the achievements of the laureates was meant to encourage other students to serve the society in similar manner. One of the most cited statements is the engraving of the first stele which was redacted by Th\u00e2n Nh\u00e2n Trung in 1484 for the 1442 imperial examination during the reign of L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng: {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"90%\" style=\"background- color: #EEEEEE;\" |----- | > \u2014 Excellent talents with good virtue are the sap of the country.

In total, there are 2,313 names of laureates that were carved in the stelae, they were recognized after passing imperial examination between 1484 and 1780 organized by the L\u00ea, M\u1ea1c, Tr\u1ecbnh and Nguy\u1ec5n dynasties. The first one was erected in 1484 during the reign of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng with the record of the 1442 imperial examination while the last stele was made in 1780 for the 1779 examination. Among the names engraved in the collection are many well-known figures in the history of Vietnam such as the historian Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean, the scholar L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n or the diplomat Ng\u00f4 Th\u00ec Nh\u1eadm. Some of those names during the period of Tr\u1ecbnh lords were afterwards crossed out by orders of the Nguy\u1ec5n emperors since the laureates had participated in activities considered against the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. Since the stelae were partly damaged during the war between the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty and the troops of Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, the emperor Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n wanted to restore the collection but could not complete the work because of the collapse of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty in 1802. After the establishment of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, the emperor Gia Long decided to transfer the capital from Hanoi to Hu\u1ebf, thus a new Temple of Literature was built in Hu\u1ebf where new stelae were placed. The total number of stelae in Hu\u1ebf is 32 with the last one dated in 1919. The collection is appreciated as a national treasure of Vietnam because it provides not only information about the education during 300 years of dynastic Vietnam but also the details about the system of imperial examinations of the past dynasties. ==Memory of the World== Initially, the Vietnamese nominations in 2007 and 2008 for the Memory of the World Programme were the Woodblocks of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty and a collection of old photographs of Indochina. While the former was quickly registered by UNESCO in 2009, the latter was finally replaced by the collection of stone stelae of the L\u00ea and M\u1ea1c dynasties which was considered more original and intact. This nomination was ultimately accepted by UNESCO at its meeting in Macau on March 9, 2010 and thus the collection of stele records became the second entry of Vietnam in the list of the Memory of the World. ==References== Category:Memory of the World Register Category:L\u00ea dynasty texts Category:M\u1ea1c dynasty texts Category:Education in Vietnam Category:Vietnamese history texts ",
