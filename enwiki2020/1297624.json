Dimitrenko's professional debut averaged over 5 million viewers on Sat.1. Standing at an imposing , he was widely regarded as one of the top contenders for a future world title opportunity. He compiled a record of 14 wins in 14 bouts, with 10 of them having ended inside the distance, 8 of them - inside the first two rounds. He was then scheduled to face his first notable opponent, Ross Puritty. The bout generated attention in both Germany and Ukraine, given Puritty's win over Wladimir Klitschko six years prior, with Dimitrenko entertaining the idea of beating someone who had defeated one of the Klitschkos. The bout was scheduled to happen on 31 July 2004, but Purrity pulled out after suffering an elbow injury during training camp while sparring with Juan Carlos Gomez. Puritty pulled out just three days before the scheduled date. Instead, Dimitrenko faced former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Julius Francis, who at the time was used as a stepping stone by some of the rising prospects, such as Audley Harrison and Volodymyr Vyrchys, and as a stay-busy fight by heavyweight contenders. Dimitrenko won the bout by a lopsided unanimous decision (UD), with all three judges scoring the bout identically 80\u201372. The fight between Dimitrenko and Puritty was re-scheduled to take place on 6 November 2004, with Dimitrenko agreeing for a tune-up bout against Andy Sample. Dimitrenko defeated Sample by second-round TKO. On 6 November 2004, he finally faced Puritty in an anticipated showdown that was televised by ZDF. The fight was part of the three-fight main event which also saw Sergiy Dzindziruk defending his European welterweight title against Hussein Bayram, and Mario Veit defending WBO world super-middleweight title against Charles Brewer. Dimitrenko outboxed Puritty for the majority of the fight, staying on the outside and keeping his opponent at the end of his jab. Ultimately, Dimitrenko won the fight by unanimous decision (UD), with scores 80\u201372 (twice) and 79\u201373. === Rising through the rankings === In his next outing, on 5 March 2005, he faced hard-hitting American prospect, Chris Koval, on the undercard of Felix Sturm vs. Bert Schenk. This was Dimitrenko's first fight scheduled for 10 rounds. Coming into the fight, 22-year old Koval had 20\u20131 record with 16 KOs, with 11 of them in the first round. Dimitrenko was knocked down in the second round, but dominated his opponent throughout the rest of the fight. The bout went full ten rounds, with Dimitrenko being declared the winner by a lopsided unanimous decision with scores 98\u201391 (twice) and 98\u201392. This was bettered othen 2 July 2005, when Dimitrenko picked up two vacant regional championships \u2014 IBF and WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight titles \u2014 after a second-round knockout of Andreas Sidon. Dimitrenko then agreed to face Vaughn Bean on September 28, 2005 as part of the card dedicated to 100th anniversary of the birth of former world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling, with the main event of the night being the WBO world heavyweight title fight between Luan Krasniqi and Lamon Brewster. The fight card had seven boxers from the former Soviet Bloc scheduled to fight - Dimitrenko, Ruslan Chagaev, Denis Boytsov, Taras Bidenko, Valeriy Chechenev, Bagrat Ohanyan and Alexei Mazikin, with the latter being forced to pull out due to injury. 31-year old Bean, known for having competitive bouts with world champions Evander Holyfield and Michael Moorer and having been only stopped by Vitali Klitschko, was considered Dimitrenko's toughest challenge to date. In the opening rounds, Dimitrenko was mostly throwing straight punches, struggling with Bean's movement and counterpunching style, as well as attacks to the body. Bean was deducted a point in round three for intentional low blows. In the eighth round, Dimitrenko staggered Bean with a left hook and continued to apply pressure on his opponent, going back-and-forth between attacks to the head and body. Dimitrenko was ultimately declared the winner by unanimous decision, with the judges scoring the bout 95\u201393, 96\u201392 and 95\u201393. After defeating Chad Van Sickle by second-round TKO, Dimitrenko agreed to face Argentine boxer Gonzalo Omar Basile on 28 October 2006. In the build up to the fight, Basile received media attention for his tattoos. During pre-fight press conference, Basile claimed to be \"the devil between heavyweights\", while Dimitrenko expressed his disgust with \"so many tasteless tattoos\" on Basile's body, and that he was going to punish Basile for them. In the lead-up to the fight, Dimitrenko's coach Fritz Sdunek said that his fighter was getting better with each bout, and that very soon he would become \"the new Klitschko\" and fight for the world heavyweight title. The fight took place at Porsche-Arena in Stuttgart and was televised on ZDF. It was Basile's first professional bout outside of South America. The fight lasted 54 seconds, with Basile's corner throwing in the towel after Basile could not respond to a barrage of shots from Dimitrenko. In his last fight of 2006, Dimitrenko faced an experienced American journeyman Billy Zumbrun on 18 November 2006, only three weeks after beating Basile. Originally, the main event of the card was supposed to be the fight between Felix Sturm and Gavin Topp, but the fight was postponed due to Sturm's injury. Dimitrenko, regarded as a popular commodity in Germany at the time, was considered to be an adequate replacement for Sturm. According to Dimitrenko, the fight turned out to be \"tougher than expected\". He won by a shut-out unanimous decision, knocking Zumbrun down in the first round and dominating him throughout the rest of the fight. Zumbrun was deducted a point in the tenth round for headbutting. The judges scored the bout 120\u2013105, 119\u2013107 and 120\u2013106. By the end of 2006, Dimitrenko was ranked No.4 heavyweight contender by WBO. Dimitrenko then had two stay-busy fights in the first half of 2007, defeating American heavyweights Danny Batchelder and Malcolm Tann by mid-fight TKOs. By July 2007, Dimitrenko was ranked No.2 contender by WBO, No.6 contender by WBC and No. 10 contender by WBA. He then signed to face Timo Hoffmann on 17 November 2007. Hoffmann, who had previsouly faced fighters like Vitali Klitschko, Luan Krasniqi and Henry Akinwande and was known for his durability, had never been stopped inside the distance coming into this bout, and was expected to be a tough challenge for Dimitrenko and an opportunity to elevate Dimitrenko's popularity in Germany. Dimitrenko weighed in at and was outweighed by Hoffmann by . This was also the first professional fight in which Dimitrenko was fighting someone taller than himself. The bout took place at B\u00f6rdelandhalle in Magdeburg and was the main event of the card that was aired on ZDF. Both fighters started fighting aggressively and throwing heavy shots from the opening bell, with Dimitrenko appearing to be doing the better work, finding success working Hoffman's body. At the beginning of the fourth round, Dimitrenko unleashed a barrage of punches that sent Hoffmann to the canvas. Hoffmann got up but was knocked down again after a series of body shots. By the end of the round, Dimitrenko appeared to be tired. Hoffmann regained composure in round 5, pressing Dimitrenko against the ropes and knocking him down with a left hook. In the second half of the fight, both fighters were trading shots, with Dimitrenko having the upper hand in most of the exchanges. By the eighth round, Hoffmann's face was covered in blood, while Dimitrenko had swells above both eyes. Dimitrenko unleashed another barrage of punches in the twelfth round, knocking Hoffmann down again. Hoffmann got up, but was soon dropped again. Dimitrenko then threw a series of unanswered shots, prompting the referee to stop the bout after Hoffmann was dropped again, with 36 seconds left to the end of the fight. Dimitrenko became the first boxer to defeat Timo Hoffmann inside the distance. During post-fight drug testing, Hoffmann tested positive for anabolic steroids. After defeating Derric Rossy by fifth-round TKO in a stay-busy fight, Dimitrenko then signed to face then-highly regarded German boxer Luan Krasniqi on 18 November in D\u00fcsseldorf, as part of the show billed by Universum as \"Golden November\". Many observers saw this fight as a big step up in competition for Dimitrenko and Krasniqi's last chance to regain his stock after losses to Lamon Brewster and Tony Thompson. During pre-fight press conference, Krasniqi said that if he wouldn't beat Dimitrenko, he was going to retire. The fight lasted only three rounds. In the third round, Dimitrenko dropped Krasniqi with a liver shot. Krasniqi was unable to get up at the count of ten, prompting the referee to stop the fight, declaring Dimitrenko the winner by third-round KO. This was Dimitrenko's fifth stoppage in a row, achieved against opponents with combined record 133\u201315\u20133. At the conclusion of 2008, Dimitrenko entered The Ring heavyweight rankings at No.10. He was also ranked No.2 contender by WBO and No.7 contender by WBA and IBF. === WBO world heavyweight title eliminator === After two reigns as WBO Inter-Continental champion, Dimitrenko was scheduled to face Eddie Chambers in a WBO world heavyweight title eliminator.Vester, Mark (4 July 2009). \"Chambers Decisions Dimitrenko To Land Klitschko Shot\".

The judges scored the bout 117\u2013109 and 116\u2013111 in favor of Chambers, and 113\u2013113 even. === Later fights; inactivity and return === Looking to regain his stock, Dimitrenko agreed to face Luan Krasniqi in a rematch on 28 November 2009 in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Some observes criticized the fight, pointing out that Krasniqi hadn't fought in the ring since their first encounter. Dimitrenko dismissed these criticisms, claiming that Krasniqi, despite the long stretch of inactivity, was still a dangerous fighter with a lot of experience. Three weeks before the scheduled date, Krasniqi was forced to pull out due to sprained Achilles tendon on his right leg. The fight was postponed, then cancelled altogether.\u041e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0451\u043d \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u041b\u0443\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0411\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e-\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d Dimitrenko bounced back on 31 July 2010, scoring a fifth-round stoppage over Yaroslav Zavorotnyi to win the vacant European heavyweight title.Sukachev, Alexey (31 July 2010). \"Dimitrenko Stops Zavorotnyi in Five, Audley Harrison Next?\".
