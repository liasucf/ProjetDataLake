    "text": "{| |} The Vashon Ranger R7 is an American light-sport aircraft designed and produced by Vashon Aircraft of Woodinville, Washington. It was formally introduced at the AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in July 2018. The aircraft is supplied complete ready-to-fly-aircraft. ==Design and development== The development of the Ranger R7 started in about 2013. By February 2018 two prototypes were flying and four production aircraft were under construction, for April 2018 delivery. The aircraft is an all-metal monocoque design and features a cantilever high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by- side configuration enclosed cabin, accessed by doors, fixed tricycle landing gear, with a castering nosewheel and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from pre-painted sheet 6061-T6 aluminum to save construction time. The seats fold flat to allow sleeping in the cabin when camping. The company manufactures the majority of parts itself to reduce costs and shorten the supply chain. By January 2018 the design had been accepted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a light-sport aircraft. ==Operational history== By May 2017, one example had been registered in the United States with the FAA. In a review of the design on AVweb, writer Paul Bertorelli indicated that the aircraft suffers from a low useful load of , due to the choice of the old-technology Continental O-200D engine, which is or more heavier than other newer engines. By April 2019, 12 production aircraft had been delivered to customers, who included individuals and flight schools. ==Variants== === Ranger R7 Yellowstone === Base model powered by a Continental O-200-D four-stroke, air-cooled powerplant and fitted with a Dynon SkyView glass cockpit avionics system. === Ranger R7 Glacier === Intermediate model powered by a Continental O-200-D four-stroke, air-cooled powerplant and fitted with a 10\" Dynon SkyView HDX glass cockpit avionics system, additional exterior options are also available. === Ranger R7 Redwood === Premium model powered by a Continental O-200-D four-stroke, air-cooled powerplant and fitted with dual 10\" Dynon SkyView HDX glass cockpit avionics system, additional exterior options are also available. ==Specifications (R7) == ==References== ==External links== * *Video review on AVweb Ranger R7 Category:2010s United States sport aircraft Category:2010s United States civil utility aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:High-wing aircraft ",
