The Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, or Xuanzheng Yuan () was a government agency and top-level administrative department set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) that supervised Buddhist monks in addition to managing the territory of Tibet during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) established by Kublai Khan. It was originally set up in 1264 as an autonomous office named Zongzhi Yuan () or the Bureau of General Regulation, before it was renamed in 1288,Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times, p194, by Morris Rossabi which was named after the Xuanzheng Hall where Tibetan envoys were received in the Tang dynasty. In the Mongol Empire, Tibet was managed by the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, separate from the other provinces of the Yuan dynasty such as those governed the former Song dynasty of China, but still under the administrative rule of the Yuan. While no modern equivalents remain, the political functions of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs might have been analogous to the India Office in London during the British Raj. Besides holding the title of Imperial Preceptor or Dishi, Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa, the fifth leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, was concurrently named the director of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen ('great administrator', a civilian administrator who governed Tibet when Sakya Lama was away), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing.China's Tibet Policy, p139, by Dawa Norbu Tibetan Buddhism was not only practiced within the capital Beijing but throughout the country.Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia, by Charles Orzech, Henrik S\u00f8rensen, Richard Payne, p548 Apart from Tibetan affairs, the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs managed the entire Buddhist clergy throughout the realm (whether they were Han Chinese, Tibetan or Korean etc.), and supervised all temples, monasteries, and other Buddhist properties in the empire, at least in name.Imperial China 900-1800, by Frederick W. Mote, p483 According to scholar Evelyn Rawski, it supervised 360 Buddhist monasteries.The Last Emperors: A Social History of Qing Imperial Institutions, by Evelyn S.

The Lifan Yuan (also known as the Board for the Administration of Outlying Regions and Office of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs etc.) established by the Manchus was roughly a Qing dynasty version of Xuanzheng Yuan, instituted by the Yuan state for administering affairs beyond the borders of China proper.State and Ethnicity in China's Southwest, by Xiaolin Guo, p29 == See also == * Administrative divisions of the Yuan dynasty * Tibet under Yuan rule * Imperial Preceptor * Dpon-chen ; Similar government agencies * Lifan Yuan (Qing dynasty) * Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (Republic of China) * State Ethnic Affairs Commission (People's Republic of China) * State Administration for Religious Affairs (People's Republic of China) == References == Category:Government of the Yuan dynasty Category:History of Tibet Category:China\u2013Tibet relations Category:Buddhism and government Category:1264 establishments Category:1354 disestablishments ",
