    "text": "Jean-Baptiste Alfred Perot (; 3 November 1863 - 28 November 1925) was a French physicist. Together with his colleague Charles Fabry he developed the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer in 1899. The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Janssen Medal for 1912. The Royal Society awarded Fabry and Perot the Rumford medal in 1918. ==Spelling== There is some confusion about the spelling of Perot's last name. Perot himself used the spelling P\u00e9rot in scientific publications, but according to the French civil registry, his family name was Perot, without accent. (inset \"P\u00e9rot ou Perot?\" on the second page. Translation: \"In the previous issue...we wrote \"P\u00e9rot\", after the spelling that Alfred Perot himself used to sign his articles. Several readers pointed out to us that the \"official\" spelling \u2014 that is, the one used on the birth certificate \u2014 does not have an accent.\") ==References== ==External links== * * \"Alfred Perot, un exp\u00e9rimentateur et inventeur de talent\" A good biography, in French.
