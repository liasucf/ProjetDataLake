Radford-Hill went on to receive her ABD in American Studies at U of P, and her PH.D in Humanities at Columbia Commonwealth University in Wyoming. == Book- Further to Fly == Further to Fly: Black Women and the Politics of Empowerment was published in 2000 and focuses on the importance of black feminism in the fight for equality. Radford-Hill highlights how black feminists have lost their activist roots in the thirty years prior to 2000. She explains how the fight for equality for African-Americans heavily relies on the support from the female and feminist community within. Radford-Hill argues that once black women regain their power as activists, that the economic, and social prejudice against blacks will wither. She sources this decline in activism to three things: the migration of blacks to white neighborhoods, The Moynihan Report, and the misogynistic ways of the black nationalist movement. She blames postmodern feminism for depleting the role of black women in activism because according to her research, black women were not empowered by this movement. Rather, she explains how black women were shown that the new wave of feminism was only meant for white women . Radford-Hill then goes on to explain how this gap in activism can be closed . To increase activism, she encourages black feminists to refer back to the roots of traditional feminist thought when the movement was more inclusive and empowering towards black women . She also suggests that black women need to appeal to the current social issues, engage with their community, and become more economically motivated in their activism in order to promote their activism. She explains how activists must be authentic in their work by committing to implementation of social change and research . Radford-Hill advocates for the collaboration between all feminists but overall focuses on how black women can strengthen their activism through communicating with each-other. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Writers from Chicago Category:African-American women academics Category:Black feminism Category:DePaul University alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:American feminist writers ",
