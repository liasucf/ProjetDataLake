The school mascot is the Colt. ==History== In 1997, the Dufferin-Peel trustees named the school in recognition of the 500th anniversary of John Cabot's famous North American landing. John Cabot Catholic Secondary School's original building was founded in 1997. It was previously a holding site for other high schools such as St. Francis Xavier Secondary School, St. Joseph's Secondary School and Father Michael Goetz Secondary School. Joseph Geiser was the founding principal and introduced the school's motto of 'Faith, Hope and Charity'. In the spring of 2003, the school moved to a Streetsville (holding school) campus on Mississauga Road while a new facility was constructed. Students entered the new facility in September 2004. The first student body voted on a mascot, the Colt, to represent the student athletics. A big colt was painted on the gym walls to promote school athletics. The school currently has sports teams in a number of sports, such as soccer, basketball, badminton, volleyball, and softball. There are also a number of clubs available for students to join.
