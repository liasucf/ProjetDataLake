    "text": "Armillifer armillatus is a species of the genus Armillifer occurring in tropical Africa. Its typical definitive hosts are pythons, such as the African rock python, while rodents are presumed to act as intermediate hosts. Humans may become accidentally infected by the eggs particularly if consuming (or otherwise contacting) infected snakes. Ingested eggs develop into nymphs that invade different visceral organs causing a disease called porocephalosis. Most human infections are asymptomatic, some are debilitating, or rarely even lethal. Most of the pythons sold for human consumption at the rural bushmeat markets in the DR Congo host Armillifer armillatus. ==References== Category:Maxillopoda Category:Crustaceans described in 1848 ",
