She studied obstetrics and gynecology in Germany before returning to Oslo and opening a practice. She was appointed by the government to work in the Department of Venereal Diseases. She was the daughter of a poor watchmaker's widow. Eventually she married ophthalmologist S\u00f8ren Holth and had five daughters, but two of them died at age one, and after that she gave up her practice. However, she continued to work in the Healthcare Commission until 1920, when she had to stop for health reasons. ==References== Category:1865 births Category:1942 deaths Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Norwegian women physicians Category:19th-century women physicians Category:19th-century Norwegian physicians ",
