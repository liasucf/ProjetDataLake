    "text": "The East Is Red, also known as Swordsman III, is a 1993 Hong Kong wuxia film. The main character in the film is loosely based on Dongfang Bubai, a character in Louis Cha's novel The Smiling, Proud Wanderer. The film was produced by Tsui Hark, directed by Ching Siu-tung, and starred Brigitte Lin, Joey Wong and Yu Rongguang. The film is regarded as a sequel to The Swordsman and Swordsman II. ==Plot== Following Dongfang Bubai's apparent death in Swordsman II, the jianghu (martial artists' community) disintegrates into chaos as it lacks a dominant figure to serve as a de facto leader. Several imposters use Dongfang Bubai's name to rally supporters, form their own sects, and fight for power. One of Dongfang Bubai's devoted lovers, Xue Qianxun, rebuilds the Sun Moon Holy Cult by impersonating Dongfang Bubai. The Ming imperial court sends a naval admiral, Gu Changfeng, to assist the Spanish in searching for the remains of a Dutch warship sunk near Black Woods Cliff, the site of Dongfang Bubai's death in Swordsman II. At Black Woods Cliff, Gu Changfeng discovers that Dongfang Bubai is still alive in disguise as an elderly woman, and manages to convince him to return to the jianghu. Dongfang Bubai unleashes his fury and starts a bloodbath in eliminating all those who impersonate him. He discovers that Xue Qianxun has been pretending to be him, and seriously injures her in anger. Consumed by his desire for power, Dongfang Bubai decides to continue his ambitious plan to unite the jianghu under his rule and dominate China. Gu Changfeng realises that Dongfang Bubai has gone out of control so he leads the Ming imperial navy to fight Dongfang and his Spanish and Japanese allies. In the ensuing naval battle, all the warships are destroyed and Dongfang Bubai emerges victorious after defeating and killing Gu Changfeng. However, Xue Qianxun loses her life in the process. Dongfang Bubai realises his mistake and embraces his dead lover as he retires from the jianghu again. ==Cast== * Brigitte Lin as Dongfang Bubai * Joey Wong as Xue Qianxun * Yu Rongguang as Gu Changfeng * Lau Shun * Eddy Ko * Jean Wang * Lee Ka-ting * Kingdom Yuen ==Reception== The film received a positive review from the Los Angeles Times. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1993 films Category:Films based on works by Jin Yong Category:Films directed by Ching Siu-tung Category:Hong Kong films Category:Wuxia films Category:Works based on The Smiling, Proud Wanderer Category:Films based on Chinese novels Category:Films set in the Ming dynasty Category:Hong Kong LGBT-related films Category:Transgender-related films Category:1993 LGBT-related films ",
