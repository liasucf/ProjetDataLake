The Anglican Church commenced its ministry in the region in 1870 with the arrival in Townsville of James Adams, newly graduated from Moore Theological College in Sydney. As there were no church building in Townsville, services were conducted in the Townsville Court House until Adams could arrange for a church to be constructed. The Diocese of North Queensland was established in 1879 from that part of the Diocese of Sydney lying north of 22\u00b0S latitude in the State of Queensland. In 1900 the Diocese of Carpentaria was formed from part of the northern area of the diocese, but in 1996 this action was reversed. ==Bishops== ==Assistant bishops== ===Assistant bishops serving the Aboriginal people=== * Arthur Malcolm (bishop 1985\u20132000) * Jim Leftwich (bishop 2001\u20132010) ===Assistant bishops serving the Torres Strait Islander people=== * Ted Mosby (bishop 1997\u20132000) * Saibo Mabo (bishop 2002\u20132015) ===Other assistant bishops=== * George Tung Yep: on 12 October 1985, John Grindrod, Archbishop of Brisbane consecrated George Tung Yep (hitherto archdeacon) and Arthur Malcolm (Arthur Alistair Malcolm ; hitherto a canon) assistant bishops of the diocese.
