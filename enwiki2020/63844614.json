The Essential History of Rugby Union. Nick Oswald and John Griffiths. Headline Book Publishing. 2003 On moving to Spain he played for RC Valencia.

He scored a try in the match. Despite his score Scotland lost the match and Gilmour was not selected again. He recalls: > Like all young rugby players, I had always dreamed of playing for Scotland, > but my debut was certainly a very different experience to what I imagined it > would be. I had come off a very successful Five Nations with the A team and > was called on to the bench for the final match of the senior championship > against England at Murrayfield. I didn't get a taste of the action that day > but I was hopeful I would claim my cap at some point on the tour to the > southern hemisphere. So when the team was revealed for the Fiji game, I was > obviously thrilled to be given the nod. My memories of the day of the game > and the match itself are a bit hazy, but it was very hard and physical. We > didn't start very well and let them into the game with some basic errors and > turn-overs, which allowed them to get ahead and that really got the crowd > involved. Once they were in front, it was a became very difficult game to > turn around because they were successfully disrupting us. They were also > playing some great handling and running rugby and we found it increasingly > difficult to get any control of the game. In fact, the 51-26 result shows we > clearly failed to do so. It was a disappointing day, ultimately, but I still > feel fortunate to have been given the opportunity to play rugby for my > country. ===Coaching career=== After playing, he coached the RC Valencia side. ==Outside of rugby union== Gilmour is a software developer. After working in Spain he returned to Scotland in 2015 and runs the software firm Gilmation. ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scotland international rugby union players Category:Heriot's RC players Category:RC Valencia players Category:Edinburgh Rugby players Category:Living people ",
