The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) lost seats, but remained the largest party in the National Council with over three times as many seats as the second-placed Common Choice, a left-wing alliance, which almost failed to enter the parliament despite its good performance in pre-election opinion polls. After the election, the HZDS formed a coalition with the Union of the Workers of Slovakia and the Slovak National Party. ==Results== Swing and seat change for Common Choice are compared to the combined results of SD\u013d, SDSS, and SZ, which competed independently in 1992. {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right | colspan=7 align=center| 350px |- ! colspan=2| Party !
