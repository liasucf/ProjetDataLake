    "text": "Fire Triangle Fire control is the practice of reducing the heat output of a fire, reducing the area over which the fire exists, or suppressing or extinguishing the fire by depriving it of fuel, oxygen, or heat (see fire triangle). The classification below relates to the United States of America. Different classifications exist in other countries. Fire prevention and control, the prevention, detection, and extinguishment of fires, including such secondary activities as research into the causes of fire, education of the public about fire hazards, and the maintenance and improvement of fire- fighting equipment. The three main components of a fire is fuel, heat and oxygen, without one or the other the fire can not live. within fire control there are different classes of fire; Class -A fires, Class -B fires, Class -C fires, Class -D fires, and class -K fires. Each class is specific to the type of fire and requires a specific approach and by using and understanding the class fires it can help control the fire. When putting out a fire you need to understand what fire extinguisher to use, because if the wrong extinguisher is used it can either make the fire worse or not be controlled. For an example, using a type A, B, C fire extinguisher on a chemical fire will do the opposite of what the extinguisher is supposed to do and it can cause an explosion. The different classes of fire need different fire extinguishers such as; CO2 fire extinguishers, type A, B, or C carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, and the water-based fire extinguisher. Before using a Fire extinguisher it is crucial to understand how the extinguisher works and where to point it, P.A.S.S. is an acronym (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Shoot) to help remember how to use the extinguisher. Fire Extinguisher CO2 extinguishers let out carbon dioxide to smother the fire and prevents the fire from getting oxygen which will depreciate the fire and it wont be able to breath and will die. Class A extinguisher is meant to be used on fires that have wood, paper, and plastic, class B fire extinguishers are meant be used on liquid fires such as oils, gasoline, kerosine, and paint, and Class C fire extinguishers are to be used on electrical equipment. == Class-A fires == A Class A Fire is a fire that consist of paper, wood, and plastics, this is one of the most common fires along with being the most simplest fire to put out with a fire extinguisher. This class fire can simply be started by starting a campfire in the backyard and an ash from the fire catches the ground on fire or and lightning strike that hits a tree. The most common method to control a class-A fire is to remove heat by spraying the burning solid fuels with water. Another method of controlling a class-A fire would be to reduce the oxygen content of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the fire (i.e., \"smother\" the fire), such as by the introduction of an inert gas such as carbon dioxide. In a wildfire, fire control includes various wildland fire suppression techniques such as defensible space, widening the fuel ladder, and removing fuel in the fire's path with firebreaks and backfires to minimize the brush fire reaching new combustible fuel and spreading further. == Class-B fires == Some Class B fires (hydrocarbons, petroleums, and fuels on fire) cannot be efficiently controlled with water. Fuels with a specific gravity less than water, such as gasoline or oil, float on water, resulting in the fire continuing in the fuel on top of the water. The application of a combination of fire suppressant foam mixed with water is a common and effective method of forming a blanket on top of the liquid fuel which eliminates the oxygen needed for combustion. The configuration of some fuels, such as coal and baled waste paper, result in a deep seated and burrowing fire, resulting in less effective fire control by the application of water on the outer surfaces of the fuel. Some Class-B fires can be controlled with the application of chemical fire suppressants. Class B fires should be extinguished by foam, powder or carbon dioxide extinguishers and the foam is more dens and cuts off the oxygen from the fire. == Class-C fires == Class-C fires involve electricity as a continuous power source for the ignition of the fuels associated with electrical equipment, such as plastic cable jackets. The application of water does not always result in effective fire control, and there is a general concern regarding conductivity and personnel safety. Class C fires can be effectively controlled by removing the oxygen. The removal of electricity as a continuous ignition source is important to eliminate re-ignition. Once the electricity is removed, the result is a Class A fire. Foam or dry chemical powder can be used to control fires involving shallow liquid spill. You do not want to use water to put out a class C fire, you can get shocked and cause the fire to grow, the best way to put an electrical fire out is with a dry powder or carbon dioxide, dry chemical ABC extinguisher. If the source of the electricity that started the fire was unplugged and the electricity was turned off then the fire changes to a class A or B fire. == Ventilation == Fires can spread through the interior of a structure as the hot gases spread due to the expansion of the gases as a result of the combustion. Some fires can be partially controlled by venting these gases to the outside through manufactured heat vents in the structure's roof, or by the fire department cutting holes in the roof. Ventilation is important when it comes to the fire service, ventilation is \"the systematic removal or heat, smoke and fire gases from a structure\". The main purpose for ventilating a fire is decrease the likelihood of a flashover from occurring. When is the right time to ventilate? You do not want to ventilate when Firefighters are inside, the best time to ventilate is before sending anyone in so that way when venting from the roof that will be the bath the fire will take vs not venting and firefighters going in through the front door and by opening that door it allows more oxygen to feed the fire and the fire will take the path you just made. == See also == * Fire classes * Fire bucket ==References== Category:Firefighting Category:Wildfires Category:Wildland fire suppression ",
