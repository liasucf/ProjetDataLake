    "text": "The uvular ejective is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . ==Features== Features of the uvular ejective: ==Occurrence== One ejective A single plain uvular ejective is found in almost all Northeast Caucasian languages, all South Caucasian languages, and some Athabaskan languages, as well as Itelmen, Quechua and Aymara. *Itelmen, where it is written \u04c4': \u04c4'\u0438\u043b'\u0445\u0447 to depart. *Georgian, where it is written \u10e7: \u10e2\u10e7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8 skin, pelt. Unlike its velar counterpart, it does not contrast with voiced or voiceless uvular stops; the voiceless uvular stop of Old Georgian has merged with the voiceless velar fricative in modern Georgian. Some scholars view this Georgian phoneme as being rather an uvular ejective fricative . *Tahltan: door. Two ejectives Most Salishan languages, the Tlingit language, and Adyghe and Kabardian (Northwest Caucasian) demonstrate a two-way contrast between labialised and plain uvular ejectives. *Klallam: w\u0259q\u0315\u0259\u0301q\u0315 frog, sq\u0315\u02b7\u00fa\u014bi(\u0294) head. *Lezgian, where the two are written \u043a\u044c and \u043a\u044c\u0432: \u043a\u044c\u0430\u043a\u044c\u0430\u043d tall, high, \u043a\u044c\u0432\u0435\u0445 groin. *North Straits Salish, where the two are written K and K\u0334 in the Saanich orthography: Saanich KEYO\u1e6eEN slug, snail, SK\u0334E\u1e30\u0106ES red huckleberry. The Akhvakh language appears to have a contrast between lax and tense uvular ejectives: soup, broth (lax) vs. cock's comb (tense). Three ejectives *Abkhaz contrasts plain, palatalised and labialised uvular ejectives, written \u049f \u049f\u044c \u049f\u0259: \u0430\u049f\u0430\u04a7\u0448\u044c red, -\u04b5\u0259\u049f\u044c\u0430 really, indeed (a verbal suffix), \u0410\u049f\u04d9\u0430 Sukhum. As with Georgian, Abkhaz has no non-ejective uvular stops; the historically present uvular aspirates have merged with their corresponding fricatives, although the aspirates are preserved in Abaza. Five ejectives *The plain uvular ejective is one of the most common consonants in Ubykh, due to its presence in the past tense suffix . But in addition to palatalised, labialised and plain uvular ejectives, Ubykh also possesses a pharyngealised version and a concurrently labialised and pharyngealised version, making a total of five: he said it, small and round, to seize, to chew, cavern. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\"| Language !!
