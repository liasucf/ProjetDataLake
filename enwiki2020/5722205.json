The facility opened in 1928 and was originally named Meade Field, in honor of John E. \"Jack\" Meade, an alumnus and local politician, said to have attended every home football and basketball game until his death in 1972. The facility adopted its current name in 1978, when an aluminum and steel grandstand was added. The stadium has undergone many changes in its history. The old field house was built in 1933, and in 1934, the west stands and press box were opened, with a capacity of 1,500. In 1978, the 50-row steel grandstand was erected on the east side, bringing the total capacity up to 8,000. Various other projects, including a press box expansion and modernization of the turf and scoreboard, took place soon after. In 2000, the west stands and field house were razed to make way for the Ryan Center. During the 2006 football season, a new set of west stands opened abutting the Ryan Center, whose east luxury boxes also look down on Meade Stadium. In the spring and summer of 2019, the university undertook a $4.1 million project that brought lights and field turf to Meade Stadium. ==Attendance== 2008, Visitor Stands built into side of Ryan Center. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Highest attendance at Meade Stadium ! style=\"\"|Rank ! style=\"\"|Attendance ! style=\"\"|Date ! style=\"\"|Opponent ! style=\"\"|Special note ! style=\"\"|Result |- |1 |13,052 |October 20, 1984 |#14 Boston University |URI ranked #11, Homecoming |W 22\u20137 |- |2 |12,933 |October 26, 1985 |Lafayette |Homecoming |W 41\u201319 |- |3 |12,211 |October 8, 1983 |Northeastern |Homecoming |W 30\u201310 |- |4 |12,092 |November 17, 1973 |Connecticut | |T 7\u20137 |- |5 |12,000 |October 17, 1970 |Massachusetts |Homecoming |W 14\u20137 |- |6 |11,700 |October 8, 1966 |Vermont |Homecoming |L 7\u201321 |- |7 |11,231 |October 31, 1987 |#6 New Hampshire |Homecoming |L 14\u201328 |- |8 |11,000 |October 7, 1967 |New Hampshire |Homecoming |W 13\u20136 |- |9 |11,000 |October 4, 1969 |Maine |Homecoming |L 7\u201335 |- |10 |10,446 |December 1, 1984 |#12 Richmond |URI ranked #2, 1-AA Quarterfinal |W 17\u201323 |- |11 |10,443 |October 4, 1980 |#8 Massachusetts |Homecoming |L 8\u201326 |- |12 |10,230 |October 16, 1982 |Boston University |Homecoming |L 16\u201326 |- |13 |10,228 |October 20, 1990 |Boston University |Homecoming |L 13\u201315 |- |14 |10,227 |October 6, 1984 |Massachusetts |URI ranked #16 |W 20\u201319 |- |15 |10,145 |October 19, 1991 |Maine |Homecoming |W 52\u201330 |- |16 |10,114 |November 2, 1985 |#14 New Hampshire |URI ranked #17 |W 30\u201320 |- |17 |10,000 |October 10, 1964 |Vermont |Homecoming |L 8\u201316 |- |18 |10,000 |October 23, 1965 |Maine |Homecoming |L 0\u201336 |- |19 |10,000 |October 12, 1968 |Vermont |Homecoming |W 52\u201310 |- |20 |10,000 |October 2, 1971 |Maine |Homecoming |L 7\u201321 |- |21 |9,882 |October 18, 1986 |Boston University |Homecoming |L 0\u201317 |- |22 |9,842 |October 10, 1981 |Northeastern |Homecoming |W 33\u20130 |- |23 |9,841 |October 22, 1983 |Southern Connecticut | |W 17\u20137 |- |24 |9,737 |November 7, 1981 |Brown |URI ranked #10 |L 8\u201310 |- |25 |9,624 |October 31, 1981 |#2 New Hampshire | |W 14\u201312 |} ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums ==References== ==External links== *Meade Stadium on GoRhody.com *Interactive Map Of FCS College Football Stadiums: Click on the Rhode Island Logo to get a satellite view & directions to the stadium Category:College football venues Category:Rhode Island Rams football Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Category:American football venues in Rhode Island Category:Sports venues in Washington County, Rhode Island Category:1928 establishments in Rhode Island Category:Sports venues completed in 1928 ",
