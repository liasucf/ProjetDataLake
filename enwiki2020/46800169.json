In 2005, Egger published a study comparing 110 trials of homeopathy with 110 trials of conventional medicine in the Lancet. It found that there was strong evidence that conventional medicine was more effective than placebo, but only weak evidence that homeopathy was. Egger told WebMD that in this study, \"The effect of homeopathy disappears if you look only at large, good trials; whereas the conventional medicines' effect is still there.\" Egger has also published research on a wide variety of other medical topics, such as the demographics of people who choose assisted suicide, the association between exposure to aircraft noise and heart attacks, and the effectiveness of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. ==References== ==External links== * Faculty page * Category:University of Bern faculty Category:Living people Category:Swiss public health doctors Category:Highly Cited Researchers Category:Alumni of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Category:Academics of the University of Bristol Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
