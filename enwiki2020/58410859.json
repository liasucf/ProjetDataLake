Several forms of t\u0101tuas serve different functions. == Etymology == \"T\u0101tua\" is a M\u0101ori-language word meaning \"belt\". == Traditional use == M\u0101ori warriors were famously known for wearing only a maro (kilt) and a t\u0101tua during battle. Traditional t\u0101tuas are made of harakeke (flax) and used to carry tools or weapons. It sits across the abdomen and can be passed on from generation to generation. T\u0101tua kotaras are broad plaited belts used as a defence against spears in the period before a mortal combat. == See also == * M\u0101ori traditional textiles * Matthew McIntyre-Wilson (contemporary weaver of t\u0101tuas) == References == == External links == * Maori Costume and Taniko Category:M\u0101ori culture Category:Weaves Category:M\u0101ori art ",
