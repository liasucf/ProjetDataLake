With Guy Verriest and Alfred De Rouck, Jules Fran\u00e7ois did pioneering work in electrooculography.Fran\u00e7ois, J., Verriest, G., & De Rouck, A. (1955). Modification of the amplitude of the human electro-oculogram by light and dark adaptation. The British Journal of Ophthalmology, 39(7), 398\u2013408. Early in his career he studied general ophthalmology, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, fever therapy, cataract and biochemistry. In the later part of his career he focused mainly on genetic studies, but retained his interest in general ophthalmology and surgery for eye diseases arising from diabetes.
