Yu Die (Mandy Wei) was a genius child prodigy who lost everything she loved. Yu Die\u2019s mother drowned while trying to save Yu Die and, in one very bad day, Yu Die lost her mother, her memory and her ability to swim. Years later, she crosses paths with Gao Hai Fei (Kingone Wang), the CEO of a multibillion corporation. Intrigued by Yu Die\u2019s lost memories, Hai Fei hides his true identity from her and gets mistaken for a professional part-time worker who is a jack-of-all-trades. Yu Die asks Hai Fei for his help with the \u201cFlying Fish\u201d Men\u2019s Swim Team, which has never been able to win a meet and is the laughing stock of the sport of swimming. With Hai Fei searching for a \u201cmermaid\u201d crush from his past, will he agree to help Yu Die turn the losing swim team around? ==Cast== ===Main cast=== *Kingone Wang as Gao Hai Fei \uff08Phillip\uff09 **Liao Bai Xiang as childhood Hai Fei *Mandy Wei as He Yu Die ** as childhood Yu Die * as Lin Ke Le **Qiu Chen En as childhood Ke Le *Cindy Yen as Fei Ou Na \uff08Fiona\uff09 *Emerson Tsai as Chen Jia Luo (Ah Luo) **Cai Rui Ze as childhood Ah Luo ===Supporting cast=== *Peter Guan as Fang Yi Lei *Aaron Lai as Wang Er Tai *Roy Chang as You Yu An * as Ruan An Zhuo * as Du Xiao Mi * as Luo Shan Shan *Dewi Chien as Qiao Ke Qi *Ban Tie Xiang as He Xing Xiong * as Pan Duo La * as Jin Chen Lang (Ah Lang) *Wayne Song as Cui Min Hao *Collins Ying as Ying Shao Hua * as An Ge Ming (Ah Wei) * as Hei Mo Li ===Cameos=== *Chang Fu-chien as school principal *Gao Wei Teng as director of student affairs *Tu Kai Xiang as section manager *Lu Wen Xue as Fang Jia Hao * as Sandy Wang *Lin Hai Er as Ke Le's mother *Wu Shi Wei as Mr. Cheng *Yang Li- yin as Auntie Hua Zhi *Zhang Chang Mian as Qing Fang *Chen Wan Hao as Uncle Black Carp *Zhuang Zhuang as Reporter Wang *Li Bo Ming as reporter *Tan Ai- chen as Gao Yan Ming Zhu * as Lei Long En * as Fei Tian Ci ==Soundtrack== *Handsome to Break Up \u5e25\u5230\u5206\u624b by Nick Chou *When You Are Gone \u9918\u6ce2\u76ea\u6f3e by Hebe Tien *Every Day is a Miracle \u4eba\u9593\u7159\u706b by Hebe Tien *A Dream Where You Dreamt of Me \u6211\u5922\u898b\u4f60\u5922\u898b\u6211 by Yoga Lin *Unshakeable Rascals \u71b1\u8840\u7121\u8cf4 by Yoga Lin *Spoiled Innocence \u5929\u771f\u6709\u90aa by Yoga Lin *Structure of the Heart \u5fc3\u7684\u69cb\u9020 by Nicola Tsang *What Is The Shape Of Your Love \u4f60\u7684\u611b\u662f\u751a\u9ebc\u5f62\u72c0 by J.Arie ==Broadcast== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Network||Country||Airing Date||Timeslot |- |SET Metro||rowspan=2|||July 8, 2016||Friday 10:00-11:30 pm |- |EBC Variety||July 9, 2016||Saturday 10:00-11:30 pm |- |Astro Shuang Xing||||July 8, 2016||Friday 10:00-11:30 pm |- |E City||||July 17, 2016||Sunday 10:00-11:30 pm |- |True Asian Series HD||||Nov 18, 2017||Saturday to Sunday 8:00-9:00 pm |- |UNTV||||This 2021||TBA |- |} ==Episode ratings== Competing dramas on rival channels airing at the same time slot were: *FTV - My Teacher Is Xiao-he *SET Taiwan - La Grande Chaumiere Violette, My Sister *TTV - Life List, Q series {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:45%;\" |- !width=\"25%\"|Air Date||width=\"5%\"|Episode||width=\"6%\"|Average Ratings||width=\"4%\"|Rank |- |Jul 8, 2016|| 1 || 1.40 || 1 |- |Jul 15, 2016|| 2 || 1.25 || 1 |- |Jul 22, 2016|| 3 || 1.45 || 1 |- |Jul 29, 2016|| 4 || rowspan=2|1.36 || 1 |- |Aug 5, 2016|| 5 || 3 |- |Aug 12, 2016|| 6 || 1.18 || 3 |- |Aug 19, 2016|| 7 || 1.41 || 3 |- |Aug 26, 2016|| 8 || 1.29 || 3 |- |Sep 2, 2016|| 9 || 1.38 || 2 |- |Sep 9, 2016|| 10 || ' || 3 |- |Sep 16, 2016|| 11 || 1.27 || 3 |- |Sep 23, 2016|| 12 || 1.37 || 2 |- |Sep 30, 2016|| 13 || 1.38 || 3 |- |Oct 7, 2016|| 14 || 1.47 || 2 |- |Oct 14, 2016|| 15 || 1.42 || 2 |- |Oct 21, 2016|| 16 || 1.38 || 2 |- |Oct 28, 2016|| 17 || 1.26 || 2 |- |Nov 4, 2016|| 18 || ' || 2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Average ratings|| || |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! | Year ! | Ceremony ! | Category ! | Nominee ! | Result |- | rowspan=9 | 2016 | rowspan=9 | 2016 Sanlih Drama Awards | Viewers Choice Drama Award | Swimming Battle | |- | Best Actor Award | Kingone Wang | |- | Best Actress Award | Mandy Wei | |- | Best Potential Award | Peter Guan | |- | Best Crying Award | Kingone Wang & Mandy Wei | |- | Best Kiss Award | Kingone Wang & Mandy Wei | |- | Best Screen Couple Award | Kingone Wang & Mandy Wei | |- | rowspan=2 | Viewers Choice Drama's Song Award | \"Handsome to Break Up\" - Nick Chou | |- | \"Unshakeable Rascals\" - Yoga Lin | |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Swimming Battle SETTV Website *Swimming Battle EBC Website * Category:2016 Taiwanese television series debuts Category:2016 Taiwanese television series endings Category:Sanlih E-Television original programming Category:Eastern Television original programming Category:2010s high school television series ",
