It was designed by Joseph Lyman Silsbee, acclaimed Chicago architect and employer/mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright. The structure, also known as Silsbee's Barber Mansion, was designed for Henry D. Barber, prominent citizen and banker in Polo, Illinois. The house retains its original features, including a glass mosaic fireplace designed by Louis Tiffany. Hand carved corbels highlight solid old wood columns in the foyer. Windows unique to this house were designed by Silsbee; they feature intersecting circles and are made of solid wood and individual panes of glass in the design. A carriage deck remains on the side porch. This extended portion of the porch floor allowed for the easy transition from porch to carriage (or horse). Two cisterns and a well exist on the property, and mechanical components for drawing and using stored water are present. Each of the eight fireplaces have hand-carved mantels that are unique to the individual rooms, as well as intricately detailed cast iron fireplace inserts. Each room, including the coat closets and butlers pantries, have working radiators that are highly decorative and original to the house.
