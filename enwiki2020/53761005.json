    "text": "The Conejo Formation (, K2C, Kscn) is a fossiliferous geological formation of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The uppermost unit of the Villeta Group, a sequence of shales and sandstones dates to the Late Cretaceous period; Turonian, Coniacian and Santonian epochs, and has a maximum thickness of . == Etymology == The formation was named in 1967 and published in 1981 by Renzoni, named after El Conejo Hill in Pontezuela, Toca, Boyac\u00e1, west of the Copa Reservoir.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.29 == Description == === Lithologies === The Conejo Formation is characterised by a sequence of calcareous sandstones, containing ammonites, shales and the uppermost part sandstone and limestone banks.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.30 In the Conejo Formation, fossils of Protopholoe colombiana, Archaeglobigerina blowi, Dicarinella concavata, Dicarinella primitiva, Sigalitruncana sigali, Marginotruncana sp. ct. M. renzi, Marginotruncana angusticarenata, Marginotruncana sp. cf. M.sinuosa, Rosita tornicata, Heterohelix globulosa, Heterohelix reussi, Whiteinella inornata, Hedbergella sp., and the ammonites Gloriaceras correai, Protexamites cucaitaense and Codazziceras scheibei have been found.Luque et al., 2015Tchegliakova & P\u00e9rez, 1995Acosta & Ulloa, 2002, p.48 === Stratigraphy and depositional environment === The Conejo Formation is the uppermost unit of the Villeta Group. It overlies the La Frontera Formation and is overlain by the Guadalupe Group. The age has been estimated on the basis of ammonites to be ranging from Turonian to Santonian. Stratigraphically, the lower part of the formation is time equivalent with the upper part of the Chipaque,Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.34 and Loma Gorda Formations.Acosta & Ulloa, 2002, p.22 == Outcrops == The type locality of the Conejo Formation is located close to El Conejo Hill in Pontezuela, Toca, Boyac\u00e1.Acosta & Ulloa, 2001, p.43 Other outcrops of the Conejo Formation have been noted in Cucaita, the urban areas of Boyac\u00e1 and Ventaquemada, around the Puente de Boyac\u00e1, south of Pesca, west of Siachoque,Plancha 191, 1998 surrounding Chiquinquir\u00e1 and Ubat\u00e9,Plancha 190, 2009 between Chivat\u00e1 and Oicat\u00e1, east of Paipa,Planchas 171 & 191, 2005 west of Tibacuy,Plancha 246, 1998 north and south of Alb\u00e1n, southeast of Cachipay, east of Anolaima, and San Antonio del Tequendama, Cundinamarca.Plancha 227, 1998 == Regional correlations == == See also == : Geology of the Eastern Hills : Geology of the Ocet\u00e1 P\u00e1ramo : Geology of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * * ==== Maps ==== * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Geologic formations of Colombia Category:Cretaceous Colombia Category:Upper Cretaceous Series of South America Category:Turonian Stage Category:Coniacian Stage Category:Santonian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Sandstone formations Category:Fossiliferous stratigraphic units of South America Category:Paleontology in Colombia Formations Formations Formations ",
