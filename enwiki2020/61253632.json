    "text": "K-144 is a east-west state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-144's western terminus is at U.S. Route 83 (US-83) and US-160 north-northwest of the City of Sublette and the eastern terminus is at US-56 northeast of the City of Copeland. K-144 was first designated a state highway on September 25, 1957. ==Route description== K-144 begins at an intersection with US-83 and US-160 north-northwest of Sublette. From here the highway begins traveling eastward through flat rural farmlands. After about it reaches an intersection with County Road Uu, also known as Rural Secondary 940 (RS-940), which travels south to US-56. From here it continues another before reaching an intersection with County Road Ww (RS-941). It continues eastward and after another it crosses into Gray County. About into Gray County it intersects RS-285, also known as Plains Road or Dice Street. From here it continues for another through flat rural farmlands before reaching an at grade crossing with a Cimarron Valley Railroad track then intersecting its eastern terminus at US-56. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 775 vehicles per day near the western terminus to 865 vehicles per day near the eastern terminus. K-144 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-144 does connect to the National Highway System at its western terminus at US-83 / US-160. ==History== The route was first authorized by the State Highway Commission of Kansas, now known as KDOT, in a May 9, 1956 meeting, as soon as Haskell and Gray counties had brought the road up to state highway standards. Then by mid 1957, the counties had finished projects to bring the road up to state highway standards and on September 25, 1957, it was designated as K-144. When first established the eastern terminus was K-45, but was redesignated as US-56 by the time K-144 was established.Oklahoma Department of Transportation, Chronological History Documentation: US 56 (correspondence between ODOT, AASHO, and other DOTs) In a July 2010 study, US-83 was planned to be constructed from Sublette to Scott City and included a diamond interchange to be built at the K-144 intersection. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 144 Category:Transportation in Haskell County, Kansas Category:Transportation in Gray County, Kansas ",
