Crawley had hoped to sell the series to a United States television network, and was disappointed with needing to settle for less profitable syndication status, but the American television networks weren't interested in buying a foreign series unless they were involved in its production. Though Crawley had hired Hollywood-based Bernard Girard as head of production, that did not satisfy the U.S. networks, who wanted more control over the series they broadcast, so the series was syndicated to United States television stations. == Episodes == == Broadcast == The series aired on CBC in Canada, premiering on 28 October 1959, and airing its finale episode on 19 October 1960. In the United Kingdom, the series aired on BBC from 12 July 1960 to 19 May 1961.
