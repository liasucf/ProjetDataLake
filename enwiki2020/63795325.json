    "text": "Little Orpheus is a 2020 adventure platform video game developed by The Chinese Room for iOs, Mac OS X and TVos. The game was released on Apple Arcade on June 12, 2020. == Development == The game was first announced in March 2019 via the company's Twitter account. In an interview The Chinese Room's Creative Director revealed: \u201cLittle Orpheus is a statement of intent; it\u2019s the studio clearing its throat ahead of what\u2019s to come. Pinchbeck wants The Chinese Room to apply its arthouse background to traditional genres moving forward, bringing an \u201cobsession with story, world-building and atmosphere,\u201d he says. Orpheus fits the mould: It\u2019s a traditional 2.5D action-adventure mobile platformer on the surface, but its world is filled with Soviet space technology, Russian mythology, and ancient creatures, including a giant dinosaur and a mysterious tentacled beast. \u201cOrpheus\u2018 story is so epic and ridiculous and, hopefully, it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s a romp. It\u2019s a real homage to Ray Harryhausen movies, \u201930s serials like Flash Gordon and stuff like that.\u201d The game was released on Apple Arcade on June 12, 2020. A new game mode and a major update was released on October 9, 2020. As of October 2020, Little Orpheus has received nominations at Golden Joystick Awards and TIGA Awards. == Reception == The game received generally positive reviews upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic. == References == == External links == * Official Website Category:Apple Arcade games ",
