Even the ruling Bharatiya janata party, which is considered as a right wing party, gives free groceries to poor people in one of its ruling states as a tactic to fight left wing ideology. However, some parties have stated their ideology as left oriented and most of them have formed a political block called \"Left Front\" in the states of West Bengal from 1977 and in Tripura also from 1993. == List of parties == * Communist Party of India(Marxist) * Communist Party of India * All India Forward Bloc * Revolutionary Socialist Party [except in Kerala where it belongs to UDF] ==Lok Sabha election tally== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;border:1px solid black;background- color:#F4F9FF\" |+ Performance of left front in Lok Sabha elections ! style=\"background-color:#99CCFF\"|Lok Sabha ! style=\"background- color:#99CCFF\"|Lok Sabha constituencies ! style=\"background-color:#99CCFF\"|Won ! style=\"background- color:#99CCFF\"|Net Change in seats |- | align=left|First | 489 || 22 || - |- | align=left|Second | 494 || 33 || 11 |- | align=left|Third | 494 || 33 || 00 |- | align=left|Fourth | 520 || 46 || 13 |- | align=left|Fifth | 518 || 53 || 07 |- | align=left|Sixth | 542 || 40 || 13 |- | align=left|Seventh | 529 ( 542* ) || 54 || 14 |- | align=left|Eighth | 541 || 36 || 18 |- | align=left|Ninth | 529 || 54 || 18 |- | align=left|Tenth | 534 || 57 || 03 |- | align=left|Eleventh | 543 || 52 || 05 |- | align=left|Twelfth | 543 || 49 || 03 |- | align=left|Thirteenth | 543 || 40 || 09 |- | align=left|Fourteenth | 543 || 59 || 19 |- | align=left|Fifteenth | 543 || 24 || 35 |- | align=left|Sixteenth | 543 || 12 || 12 |- |} * : 12 seats in Assam and 1 in Meghalaya did not vote. == References == # 2014 Indian general election # 2009 Indian general election # 2004 Indian general election # 2009 Indian general election # 1999 Indian general election # 1998 Indian general election # 1996 Indian general election # 1991 Indian general election # 1989 Indian general election # 1984 Indian general election # 1977 Indian general election # 1971 Indian general election # 1980 Indian general election # 1967 Indian general election # 1962 Indian general election # 1957 Indian general election # Indian general election, 1952 Category:Election results in India Category:Left-wing politics ",
