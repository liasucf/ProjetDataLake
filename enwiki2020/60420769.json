    "text": "Theo Akkermann (1 November 19071 August 1982) was a German sculptor who focused on public sculptures in churches and cemeteries. He held teaching positions at the University of Pretoria and in Ghent, Belgium. == Life == Akkermann and his twin sister Sabine were born in Krefeld, the children of Hermann Akkermann and Sabina Becker. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Krefeld and at the Hamburger Kunstakademie from 1926 to 1929, although he planned to become an engineer. Deciding in the end to focus on the arts, he studied at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts of Paris from 1929 to 1931, working at the studio of Jakob Mellen in H\u00fcls during vacation times. His first major work was a war memorial for the victims of World War I, unveiled at the cemetery of Nieukerk in Kerken in 1932. Akkermann studied further at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, with Hugo Lederer and Fritz Klimsch in 1932/33. Back in Krefeld, he married Adele Bieger in 1942, and the couple had three children. Many of Akkermann's works were destroyed by bombing in World War II. In 1950, Akkermann became a professor and head of a sculpture class at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. From 1957 he worked as a professor in Ghent, Belgium. Akkermann's twin sister also became a sculptor whose works are shown in public space. He died in Krefeld in 1982. == Works == Akkermann created large sculptures for public spaces, especially Christian art and monuments for churches and cemeteries. His early war memorial for the cemetery in Kerken shows larger-than-lifesize figures of six soldiers carrying the coffin of a comrade. He designed the interior of the Autobahnkapelle Geism\u00fchle near Krefeld, including a large bronze sculpture instead of an altar.
