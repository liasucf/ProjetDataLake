Focused on Andy Warhol's pop art career, it houses the largest gallery-owned collection of Warhol's artwork. ==History== Revolver was established in Beverly Hills in 2012 by serial entrepreneur Ron Rivlin who was involved in the music industry before venturing into the art world.http://notablelife.com/ron-rivlin-todays-notable- young-entrepreneur/ He began collecting Warhol after learning that a friend had realized a 600% return on the purchase of a Warhol 10 years earlier. Rivlin then started buying \"everything he liked.\" In a 2015 interview, he said, \u201cMy rule was, if I would put it up behind my sofa, I would buy it.\u201d Revolver is notable for exclusively dealing Warhol\u2019s work. Now, with over 200 original prints and paintings in its collection, Revolver Gallery has the largest gallery-owned collection of Warhol works in the entire world.http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/benefit-brings-out-rock-royalty- belasco-theater A small gallery at launch, Revolver exhibited Warhol pieces through traveling exhibits such as Andy Warhol: Icons & Symbols. The exhibit opened at L\u2019Ermitage Hotel in Beverly Hills and later moved to the Malibu Lumber Yard Gallery. Other exhibits included Andy Warhol's Ten Prolific Jews, Andy's Socialites and Gotti on Trial. In 2017, Revolver moved from Beverly Hills to a larger gallery at Bergamot Station in Santa Monica. Its first exhibit, Andy Warhol Revisited, opened on February 22, 2017, the 30th anniversary of Warhol's death. In addition to Warhol's work, the Bergamot location exhibited a work done in collaboration with Keith Haring and a tribute to Warhol by Deborah Kass. The Revolver collection includes Warhol's 1974 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, Andy Mouse (four original screenprints by Keith Haring, depicting Andy Warhol as Mickey Mouse on a dollar bill), Campbell's Tomato Juice Box (a 1964 silkscreen ink and house paint on plywood), and the John Gotti Unique Portfolio (Warhol's four unique screenprints by commission for the cover of Time in 1986). Notable celebrities who have visited Revolver include: Bruno Mars, Dave Navarro, Ryan Tedder, Coldplay, and Billy Morrison.https://www.instagram.com/revolvergallery/ ==Warhol Revisited [Traveling exhibits]== ===Vancouver=== Revolver\u2019s exhibition titled A Different Idea of Love opened in Yaletown\u2019s Maison Ai warehouse in early 2015.

Works on display in the show included silkscreens of Elizabeth Taylor, rare silkscreens of Muhammed Ali, and Warhol\u2019s silkscreens of shoes. The show was free to the public and was even extended to stay beyond its intended run. At the time, A Different Idea of Love was the largest Warhol show in Canada\u2019s history. It was later topped by Revolver\u2019s Warhol Revisited: A Mirror for Today that was held in Toronto the same year.http://www.insidevancouver.ca/2015/03/02/biggest-andy-warhol-exhibit- ever-in-canada-opens-in-vancouver-for- free/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/rare-andy-warhol- originals-on-display-in- vancouver-1.2976794http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/02/17/andy-warhol- vancouver_n_6701430.html ===Toronto=== Toronto-born Rivlin curated the 2015 exhibit Andy Warhol Revisited: A Mirror For Today in the Yorkville neighborhood of Toronto, Canada.

It was the largest grouping of Warhol's work ever shown in Canada. Andy Warhol Revisited: A Mirror for Today ran six months in 2015. It included famous Warhol works such as his \u201cCampbell\u2019s Soup Cans\u201d series in addition to silkscreen portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Mick Jagger, and Elizabeth Taylor. Described as a \u201cmodern day extension of Warhol\u2019s idea that pop is for everyone,\u201d the exhibit, in addition to displaying Warhol\u2019s work, featured interactive elements such as an integrated mobile app and an audio tour. Prior to Revolver\u2019s show, the last major Warhol exhibition was hosted by Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg in 2006 at the Art Gallery of Ontario.
