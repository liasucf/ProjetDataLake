She was the daughter of Rafel Josep Fel\u00f3s Tarong\u00ed i Aguil\u00f3, and Francina Tarongi i Mart\u00ed. She was the wife of Guillem Morro Tarongi F\u00e8s. Caterina's parents had seven children in total: Caterina, Isabel, Margalida, Francina, Francesc Guillem and Rafel. Between 1677 and 1678, 237 xuetas were imprisoned for celebrating Yom Kippur in the orchards of Pere Onofre Moixina Cort\u00e8s, after being denounced by Rafel Cort\u00e8s d'Alfons;P\u00e1gina 53, cap\u00edtulo \u00abLlinatges xuetes\u00bb, en el libro Un juego de enga\u00f1os, movilidad, nombres y apellidos en los siglos XV a XVIII de Gregorio Salinero e Isabel Test\u00f3n N\u00fa\u00f1ez.

All the family assets were seized and everyone went away with several light sentences.The chuetas of Majorca: conversos and the Inquisition of Majorca (volumen 29, 227 p\u00e1ginas), de Baruch Braunstein. Mennonite Publishing House, 1936. Consultado el 2 de abril de 2013. Just after the autos-da-f\u00e9 of 1678, the two oldest siblings of Caterina, Francesc and Guillem, managed to flee the island and arrived in Alexandria (Egypt), where they openly returned to Judaism, taking back their jewish names, David and Salom\u00f3n, respectively. ==The autos-da-f\u00e9 of 1688== On the afternoon of Sunday March 7, 1688, a group of xueta (Majorcan Jewish) families from Palma tried to flee the island on an English ship, but the vessel failed to set sail and they returned to their homes; however, they were discovered by Mallorcan Catholics, and as a result they were quickly imprisoned. Unlike the captured during the \"Conspiracy of 1678\", almost all the conversos were declared Jews and they refused to repent of their intention to return to Judaism in the countries where it was permitted. The trials were conducted during three years. In 1688, apparently because of the tortures that were applied on them, her parents and her sister Francina died. ==The autos-da-f\u00e9 of 1691== In 1691, the Spanish Inquisition held autos-da-f\u00e9 in which a total of 37 Majorcan Crypto-Jews were killed, out of a total of 82 that were processed by the Balearic inquisitorial court:El Govern honrar\u00e1 este jueves a los jud\u00edos conversos condenados a muerte en 1691 por la Inquisici\u00f3n en Mallorca. 20 MinutosFrancesc Antich homenatja els xuetes executats per la Inquisici\u00f3. *On March 7, 1691, when 21 xuetas were sentenced to light punishments. *On May 1, 1691: 21 prisoners were sentenced to death by hitting with a club and have their bodies burned later. *On May 6, 1691, when the sentences to 21 other converts were pronounced: 14 were to be burned, and seven in effigy. Out of the 14, 11 were sentenced to die being hit with a club before being burned, as forgiveness for their confession. The other three defendants were sentenced to be burned alive: Rabbi Rafel Valls, Caterina Tarong\u00ed and her brother Rafel Tarong\u00ed. Her sisters, Margalida and Isabel Tarong\u00ed, were strangled and burned \u00f3n the same day.Una familia nefasta \u2013 Historia de la familia Tarong\u00ed.

It is said that the inquisitors were impressed not only with her beauty, but her determination in not abjuring her beliefs, even defiantly, which they attributed to the \"diabolic qualities\" she possessed.Minor\u00edas y migraciones en la historia.

There is a detailed account of the burnings and also of Caterina Tarongi and her brother Rafel in the book La fe triunfante, written by the Jesuit priest Francesc Garau:Art\u00edculo para la venta del libro La fe triunfante (en papel), en espa\u00f1ol, editado por Francisco Garau. Palma de Mallorca: Miguel Font Editor, 160 p\u00e1gs., 1984. . They walked from where nowadays the Parliament of the Balearic Islands is located to Hoguera de los Jud\u00edos (the \"bonfire of the Jews\"), near Gomila Square. The three of them, Rafael Valls and the two Tarong\u00ed siblings, have been commemorated as martyrs and heroes in ballads that balearic islanders have sung until recently.Gabriel Alomar, in his prologue to the work of Estrugo El retorno a Sefarad, pp. 8; Roth, pp. 96; the poem by Francis Pelagio Briz in the Catalan calendar, Barcelona: 1870. Kayserling (p. 184) cites the following stanzas, sung by the islanders: > En Valls duia sa bandera i en Tarong\u00ed es pen\u00f3, amb sos xuetes darrera que > feien sa process\u00f3. Com es foc li va arribar a ses rues des cal\u00e7ons li deia > \u00abFelet, no't dons que ta carn no es cremar\u00e0\u00bb. I venia gent d'Eivissa, > pagesos d'Art\u00e0, d'Andratx, perque el dia sis de maig feren sa socorradissa. > Valls carried the flag and Tarong\u00ed the banner with all the xuetas behind > them who were making the procession. When the fire came to the wrinkles of > her clothes she said: \"Felet, do not give up, because your flesh will not be > burned\". And people came from Ibiza peasants from Art\u00e1 and Andratx, because > the sixth of de May they made the burning. The term \"Felet, no't dons\" used by Caterina Tarong\u00ed to encourage her brother, aged 21, not to surrender to the threats of the inquisitors, is still used in Majorca when referring to a stubborn person. ==Legacy== On May 5, 2011, an official event was held at Consolat de Mar in memory of the burning of 1691, with the attendance of Francesc Antich, president of the Government of the Balearic Islands; Rabbi Nissan ben Avraham, descendant of the Tarong\u00ed family, and Rabbi Jos\u00e9 Wallis, descendant of Rafael Valls.Baruch Braunstein: Els Xuetes de Mallorca.
