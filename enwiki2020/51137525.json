    "text": "Vikentije I Stefanovi\u0107 () was Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Serbian Patriarch for a short time during 1758. During the Habsburg rule in the Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u20131739), Vi\u0107entije served as archdeacon of Metropolitan Vikentije Jovanovi\u0107 of Belgrade (1731-1737). After Ottoman reconquest of Belgrade in 1739, Vikentije Stefanovi\u0107 decided to stay in Serbia, and rose through ecclesiastical ranks, becoming Metropolitan of Belgrade in 1753, under Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo III. Between 1755 and 1758, patriarch Gavrilo III was challenged by several rivals and finally lost the patriarchal throne. From that turmoil, metropolitan Vikentije finally emerged as new Serbian Patriarch. His tenure was very short. Upon arriving to Constantinople, he was struck with sudden illness and died. His successor was Metropolitan of U\u017eice and Valjevo Pajsije, who traveled with him to Constantinople, becoming new Serbian Patriarch as Pajsije II. == References == ==Sources== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Vikentije I Category:Metropolitans of Belgrade Category:18th- century Serbian people Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:1758 deaths ",
