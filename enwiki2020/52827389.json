Four days later, Purdue president Frederick L. Hovde announced that Holcomb's top assistant, Jack Mollenkopf, had been signed to a three-year contract as Purdue's head football coach. * On December 12, 1955, Stu Holcomb, in his new position as Northwestern's athletic director, fired head coach Lou Saban and his entire staff of assistant coaches. Four days later, Holcomb announced that he had signed Miami (OH) head coach Ara Parseghian to a three-year contract as the Wildcats' new head coach. Parseghian had led the 1955 Miami Redskins football team to a perfect 9\u20130 record. * Also in December 1955, Wisconsin head coach Ivy Williamson was promoted to athletic director. He appointed Milt Bruhn as the school's new head football coach. Bruhn had been a lineman on Minnesota's undefeated 1934 and 1935 national championship teams and had been Wisconsin's line coach since 1949. In the final AP Poll of the 1955 season, Michigan State had been ranked No. 2 and Ohio State No. 5. In the pre-season AP Poll, four Big Ten teams were ranked in the top 20: Michigan State (#2); Ohio State (#5); Michigan (#8); and Illinois (#20). In the spring of 1956, the Big Ten conducted an investigation into allegations that Ohio State coach Woody Hayes had provided financial assistance to players in violation of conference rule. Hayes admitted that he had loaned money to players but refused to provide an accounting of the loans. The investigation also discovered a \"serious irregularity\" in Ohio State's off-campus work program. In April 1956, the conference placed Ohio State on probation for one year and declared the football team ineligible to play in the 1957 Rose Bowl. In May 1956, the Big Ten sold television rights for five Big Ten football games during the 1956 season to NBC for an estimated sum of $450,000. In August 1956, Look magazine published an investigative piece alleging that Big Ten schools, including Michigan and Minnesota, were finding ways to evade the conference's rules on aid to football players. ===Regular season=== ====September 29==== On September 29, 1956, the Big Ten football games opened the season with one conference game and eight non-conference games.

Northwestern recovered five of seven Purdue fumbles and intercepted three passes. Four of the fumbles were recovered by Al Viola. After the game, Edward Prell wrote in the Chicago Tribune that Northwestern had in 1956 been \"brought back to life by its new 33 year old coach, Ara Parseghian.\" ====November 24==== On November 24, 1956, the Big Ten teams played four conference games and two non-conference games. The non-conference games resulted in two wins and no losses, giving the Big Ten a non-conference record of 19\u20135. * Iowa 48, Notre Dame 8. Iowa (ranked No. 3) defeated Notre Dame, 48\u20138, before a crowd of 56,632 at Iowa Stadium. The victory, combined with Ohio State's loss, gave Iowa its first undisputed Big Ten championship since 1932. Iowa's 48 points was the fourth highest total allowed by a Notre Dame football team to that point in the program's history. Paul Hornung sprained a thumb 10 minutes into the game and did not return. Iowa rushed for 409 yards and scored on runs of 10 and 41 yards by Ken Ploen, 23 and 61 yards by Fred Harris, and 54 yards by Mike Hagler. * Michigan 19, Ohio State 0. In the annual Michigan\u2013Ohio State football rivalry game, Michigan (ranked No. 9 in the AP Poll) defeated Ohio State (ranked No. 12), 19\u20130, before a crowd of 82,223 at Ohio Stadium. The loss deprived Ohio State of a share of its third consecutive Big Ten title and pushed Michigan to second in the conference standing. Terry Barr, playing in his last game for Michigan, scored two touchdowns. * Minnesota 13, Wisconsin 13. In the annual battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe, Minnesota (ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll) and Wisconsin played to a 13\u201313 tie before a crowd of 54,149 at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison. On the final play of the game, Wisconsin's Jon Hobbs missed his third field goal attempt of the game. Wisconsin finished the season without a conference win for the first time since 1939. * Michigan State 38, Kansas State 17. Michigan State (ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll) defeated Kansas State, 38\u201317, before a crowd of 34,115 at Macklin Stadium in East Lansing. Michigan State set a modern school record with 12 fumbles in the game. Despite the victory, Hal Middlesworth of the Detroit Free Press wrote: \"But down on the frozen turf of Macklin Stadium, it was a fumbling, bumbling performance which will find no place among State's galaxy of great games.\" * Northwestern 14, Illinois 13. In the annual Illinois\u2013Northwestern football rivalry game, Northwestern defeated Illinois, 14\u201313, before a crowd of 40,000 at Dyche Stadium in Evanston. Bob McKelver kicked two extra points for Northwestern, which proved to be the difference in a game in which each team scored two touchdowns. * Purdue 39, Indiana 20. In the annual battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, Purdue defeated Indiana, 39\u201320, at Ross\u2013Ade Stadium in Lafayette, Indiana. In his final college game, Purdue quarterback Len Dawson threw two touchdown passes, both caught by end Lamar Lundy. Mel Dillard rushed for 130 yards and three touchdowns in the game and a conference high 873 yards for the season. The game proved to be a battle for last place in the conference, with Purdue finishing in ninth place and Indiana in tenth and last place. ===Bowl games=== On January 1, 1957, Iowa defeated Oregon State, 35\u201319, in the 1957 Rose Bowl.

He had compiled a 13\u201332 record and was unable to produce a winning team in five years in the position. On December 3, 1956, both the Associated Press (AP) and United Press (UP) released their final college football polls. Both organizations ranked undefeated Oklahoma at the No. 1 spot.
