The original Tokiwa semi-express service was introduced on 1 June 1958, operating between in Tokyo and Taira Station (present-day Iwaki Station) in Fukushima Prefecture via the Joban Line using KiHa 55 series diesel multiple unit (DMU) trains. Three return services operated daily. Following electrification of the Joban Line, 451 series electric multiple unit (EMU) trains were introduced on some Tokiwa services from October 1962. Primarily used on Miyagino express services, these formations included buffet cars, although a buffet service was not provided on Tokiwa services. A typical 11-car 451 series formation (without a buffet car) as used following the October 1978 timetable revision is shown below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
