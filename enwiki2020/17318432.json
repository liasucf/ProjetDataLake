    "text": "Web Service Atomic Transaction is an OASIS standard. To achieve all-or-nothing property for a group of services, it defines three protocols (completion, volatile two-phase commit, and durable two-phase commit), and a set of services. These protocols and services together ensure automatic activation, registration, propagation and atomic termination of web services. The protocols are implemented via the WS-Coordination context management framework and emulate ACID transaction properties. Following the standard, a distributed transaction has a coordinator, an initiator, and one or more participants. ==See also== * WS-BPEL * WS-CDL * Web Service * WS-Coordination ==External links== * Web Services Atomic Transaction Version 1.1 * Web Services Atomic Transaction Version 1.2 Category:Computer standards Category:Open standards ",
