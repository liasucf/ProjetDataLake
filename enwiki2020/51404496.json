Since its admission to statehood in 1788, Virginia has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864 during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy, and the election of 1868, when the state was undergoing Reconstruction. Winners of the state are in bold. ==Elections from 1864 to present== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Winner (nationally) ! Votes ! Percent ! Loser (nationally) ! Votes ! Percent !

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
