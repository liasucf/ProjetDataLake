    "text": "Climate Alliance of European Cities with Indigenous Rainforest Peoples is a network of local authorities founded in 1990 and committed to the protection of the world's climate. The European Secretariat of Climate Alliance is based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Climate Alliance has members in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine. ==Purpose and aims== The more than 1,700 member cities and municipalities from 26 European countries aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at their source. Their allies are the indigenous peoples of the rainforests. The indigenous partners are represented by COICA, the Coordination of Indigenous Organisations of the nine neighbouring countries of the Amazon Basin. By joining Climate Alliance, cities and municipalities embrace the following voluntary commitments: * to reduce CO2 emissions by 10 percent every five years * to halve per capita emissions by 2030 at the latest (from 1990 baseline) * to preserve the tropical rainforests by avoiding the use of tropical timber * to support projects and initiatives of the indigenous partners. Foundation pillars of local climate protection are energy savings and efficient energy use as well as renewable energy sources and environment- friendly mobility. Climate Alliance advises cities and municipalities on the implementation of climate protection strategies and develops recognised tools for standardised recording of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Furthermore Climate Alliance develops and coordinates projects and campaigns, which address different target groups. Besides of own activities Climate Alliance is partner of further campaigns and steps also into political actions. On national and international level it stands up for European local authorities engaged in climate protection and supports organisations of Indigenous peoples. == External links == * Homepage of Climate Alliance: English and German * Campaign: ZOOM \u2013 Kids on the Move * Local Authorities acting for the MDGs \u2014 Europe for more development * Energy and CO2 Monitoring * The Covenant of Mayors * Alleanza per il Clima Italia Category:Environmental organisations based in Germany Category:Environmental organizations established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Germany Category:Climate change policy ",
