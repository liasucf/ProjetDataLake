Retrieved 11 July 2011. is a Chinese computer scientist and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2002, he became President of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ==Education== Li graduated from the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, Peking University in 1966. He then studied at the University of Edinburgh obtaining a PhD in computer science in 1983 supervised by Gordon Plotkin. ==Career== After graduation, he was funded by the EPSRC at Newcastle University and the University of Edinburgh as Senior Programmer. He was also a visiting professor at the Saarland University. He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1997. ==Research interests== Li is mostly engaged in the applied research of Computer Software and Theory and Internet, including programming language, software development, artificial intelligence, and integrated circuit design. ==Achievements== Li has participated in the founding, developing, and improving of the Operation Semantics of Words Structucture. In 1981, he was the first person to successfully use this structure to describe the technique of Parallel, Sync and Communication in software, and systematically solved the problems of concurrent languages, such as Ada and Edison. Operation Semantics of Words Structucture has become one of the classical semantics of programming languages. 1992, building release logic theory solved the incompleteness of information and fallibility of knowledge and nonmonotonicity of inference. 1998, first advocated research on Data Mining Technology\u3002 ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Beihang University faculty Category:Chinese computer scientists Category:Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Category:Peking University alumni Category:Presidents of universities and colleges in China Category:Scientists from Beijing ",
