Downs Boulevard (SR/CR 581), opened on March 28, 2002 after three years of construction. The highway allows a more-direct access to Interstate 75 two miles (3 km) north of the northern terminus of Interstate 275, as opposed to SR 54, which parallelled I-75 for about three miles before meeting at its interchange. The first phase of expansion, from Bruce B. Downs to Meadow Pointe Boulevard, began construction in March 2008 to mark the imminent opening of the Shops at Wiregrass. On July 31, 2010, after numerous delays, this extension of SR 56 opened for vehicular traffic. An extension to US 301 in Zephyrhills was being planned by the FDOT, and has been part of the plan since the highway's conception. The project was previously expected to be completed by the end of 2019, but finally reached US 301 on July 10, 2019.\"New 4-lane road in Pasco County connects drivers to I-75,\" by Nicole Gregg (WFTS Ch. 28: Tampa Bay) ==Future== A diverging diamond interchange with I-75 was initially proposed in May 2018; construction on the revamped intersection began in February 2019, and is expected to finish in 2021. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Florida Route Log (SR 56) 056 056 ",
