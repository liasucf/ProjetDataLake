Originally a monstrous carnival attraction, she was transformed into a beautiful and glamorous woman through surgery. Alicia learns that beauty is not everything that she imagined it to be. She finds it difficult to discern whether people like her for her personality or only because she is rich and beautiful. She yearns for her former self, the ugly Carissa. As Carissa, she felt sure that those who liked her were not attracted by her appearance. One such person was her former neighbor and lover, Mendez (Cesar Montano). Mendez is actually Hugo's grandson. He and Alicia rekindle their relationship. The lovers conceive a scheme to scam the great doctor out of his fortune. The plan calls for Alicia to wed Hugo and convince him to transfer his fortune to her. Then Mendez will murder his grandfather and the lovers will live happily ever after.
