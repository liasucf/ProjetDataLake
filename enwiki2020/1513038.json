    "text": "{| |} Montcalm is a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Marine Nationale. The French navy does not use the term \"destroyer\" for any of its ships; hence some of the larger ships, referred to as \"frigates\", are registered as destroyers. She is the fourth French vessel named after the 18th century general marquess Louis de Montcalm de Saint V\u00e9ran. ==Operational history== Montcalm was involved in operations off Libya during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. From 13 to 26 October 2014, the frigate took part in the large international operational exercise Catamaran 2014 that practiced an amphibious assault. Montcalm was decommissioned on 3 July 2017. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Georges Leygues-class frigates Category:Active frigates of France Category:1980 ships Category:Ships built in France ",
