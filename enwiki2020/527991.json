The Diamond Realm Mandala is based on an esoteric Buddhist sutra called the Vajrasekhara Sutra. The Diamond Realm is a very popular subject for mandalas, and along with the Womb Realm (garbhako\u1e63adh\u0101tu) Mandala forms the Mandala of the Two Realms. This mandala, along with the Womb Realm, form the core of Japanese esoteric, or Shingon Buddhist, rituals, including the initiation or abhi\u1e63eka ritual. In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded, and are asked to toss a flower upon a mandala. Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to. In traditional Shingon halls, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mah\u0101vairocana Buddha. In this setting, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mah\u0101vairocana Buddha. == See also == *Dhatu - Vajradhatu - Womb Realm - Dharmadhatu == References == == Further reading == * Grotenhuis, Elizabeth Ten (1999).
