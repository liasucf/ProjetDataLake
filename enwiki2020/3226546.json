    "text": "Ronald William Prest Drever (26 October 1931 \u2013 7 March 2017) was a Scottish experimental physicist. He was a professor emeritus at the California Institute of Technology, co-founded the LIGO project, and was a co-inventor of the Pound\u2013Drever\u2013Hall technique for laser stabilisation, as well as the Hughes\u2013Drever experiment. This work was instrumental in the first detection of gravitational waves in September 2015. Drever died on 7 March 2017, aged 85, seven months before his colleagues Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the observation of gravitational waves. It is generally believed that he would have won the Nobel Prize in the place of Barry Barish had he not died before the Nobel Committee made their decision. ==Education== Drever was educated at Glasgow Academy followed by University of Glasgow where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1953 followed by a PhD in 1959 for research on orbital electron capture using proportional counters. ==Career and research== After receiving his PhD from the University of Glasgow in 1959, Drever initiated the Glasgow project to detect gravitational waves in the sixties, after which he established the University\u2019s first dedicated gravitational wave research group in 1970. The same year Drever was recruited to form a gravitational wave program at Caltech. In 1984 Drever left Glasgow to work full-time at Caltech. Drever's contributions to the design and implementation of the LIGO interferometers were critically important to their ability to function in the extreme sensitivity realm required for detection of gravitational waves (10\u221223 strain). Drever's final work involved the development of magnetically levitated optical tables for seismic isolation of experimental apparatus. Ronald Drever outside his first laboratory at Caltech.
