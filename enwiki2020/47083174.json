The resort's owner is also its artist-in-residence: Jane Spencer Matthews, who studied art in both South Africa and at London University's Slade School of Art. Jane established The Eden Rock Gallery in the 1990s. Following their purchase of the resort, Jane and her husband, co-owner David Matthews, extended the complex extensively, and also renovated the hotel's original 1950s d\u00e9cor. ==History== The resort was established in the 1950s by St Barth's politician R\u00e9my de Haenen (d.2008) who sold it to the Matthews family in 1995.
