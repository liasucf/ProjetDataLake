    "text": "Arthur Fraser Mann (23 January 1948 \u2013 3 February 1999) was a Scottish professional footballer, who played as a defender. He later moved into management and coaching. ==Biography== Mann was born in Falkirk, Scotland and began his playing career at Heart of Midlothian. He played for Hearts in the 1968 Scottish Cup Final, although he ended up on the losing side as Dunfermline won 3-1. He then moved to England, where he represented Manchester City. He was signed by Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison for a then club record of \u00a365,000. Unfortunately he in common with Dennis Bergkamp had a fear of flying and so was unable to take part in City's European escapades. He failed to break into the successful Cup winning side and moved on after a season to Blackpool. He then moved to Notts County, Shrewsbury Town, Mansfield Town, Boston United (whom he also managed), Kettering Town and Telford United. He was Alan Buckley's assistant manager at Grimsby Town and West Bromwich Albion, and had a spell as caretaker-manager at Albion early in 1997 following Buckley's dismissal. He is the father of former Hull City stalwart Neil Mann. Mann died on 4 February 1999 in an industrial accident at a Birmingham factory. ==References== ;Sources * Arthur Mann * Category:1948 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Footballers from Falkirk Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scottish football managers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Heart of Midlothian F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Boston United F.C. players Category:Boston United F.C. managers Category:Kettering Town F.C. players Category:Telford United F.C. players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. managers Category:Industrial accident deaths Category:Accidental deaths in England Category:Grimsby Town F.C. non-playing staff ",
