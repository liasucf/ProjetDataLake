Benjamin for Architects (2011) Routledge, London, p. 0000. That in the age of mechanical reproduction and the absence of traditional and ritualistic value, the production of art would be inherently based upon the praxis of politics. Written during the Nazi r\u00e9gime (1933\u20131945) in Germany, Benjamin\u2019s essay presents a theory of art that is \u201cuseful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art\u201d in a mass-culture society.Scannell, Paddy. (2003) \"Benjamin Contextualized: On 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'\", in Canonic Texts in Media Research: Are There Any? Should There Be? How About These?, Katz et al. (Eds.) Polity Press, Cambridge. . pp. 74\u201389. The subject and themes of Benjamin\u2019s essay: the aura of a work of art; the artistic authenticity of the artefact; its cultural authority; and the aestheticization of politics for the production of art, became resources for research in the fields of art history and architectural theory, cultural studies and media theory.Elliott, Brian. Benjamin for Architects, Routledge, London, 2011. The original essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility\u201d, was published in three editions: (i) the German edition, Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit, in 1935; (ii) the French edition, L'\u0153uvre d'art \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de sa reproduction m\u00e9canis\u00e9e, in 1936; and (iii) the German revised edition in 1939, from which derive the contemporary English translations of the essay.Notes on Walter Benjamin, \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\", a commentary by Gareth Griffiths, Aalto University, 2011. ==Summary== In \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) Walter Benjamin presents the thematic bases for a theory of art by quoting the essay \"The Conquest of Ubiquity\" (1928), by Paul Val\u00e9ry, to establish how works of art created and developed in past eras are different from contemporary works of art; that the understanding and treatment of art and of artistic technique must progressively develop in order to understand a work of art in the context of the modern time. ==Artistic production== In the Preface, Benjamin presents Marxist analyses of the organisation of a capitalist society and establishes the place of the arts in the public sphere and in the private sphere. Then explains the socio-economic conditions to extrapolate developments that further the economic exploitation of the proletariat, whence arise the social conditions that would abolish capitalism. That the reproduction of art is not a modern human activity, and reviews the historical and technological developments of the means for the mechanical reproduction of art \u2014 such as an artist manually copying the work of a master artist, and their effects upon society's valuation of a work of art \u2014 the industrial arts of the foundry and the stamp mill in Ancient Greece; and the modern arts of woodcut relief-printing and engraving, etching, lithography, and photography, techniques of mass production that permit greater accuracy in reproducing a work of art.Benjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 01. ==Authenticity== The aura of a work of art derives from authenticity (uniqueness) and locale (physical and cultural); Benjamin explains that \u201ceven the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be\u201d located. That the \u201csphere of [artistic] authenticity is outside the technical [sphere]\u201d of mechanised reproduction. Therefore, the original work of art is an objet d\u2019art independent of the mechanically accurate reproduction; yet, by changing the cultural context of where the artwork is located, the existence of the mechanical copy diminishes the aesthetic value of the original work of art. In that way, the aura \u2014 the unique aesthetic authority of a work of art \u2014 is absent from the mechanically produced copy.Hansen, Miriam Bratu (2008). \"Benjamin's Aura\", Critical Inquiry No. 34 (Winter 2008) == Value: cult and exhibition == Regarding the social functions of an artefact, Benjamin said that \u201cWorks of art are received and valued on different planes. Two polar types stand out; with one, the accent is on the cult value; with the other, on the exhibition value of the work. Artistic production begins with ceremonial objects destined to serve in a cult. One may assume that what mattered was their existence, not their being on view.\u201dBenjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 4. The cult value of religious art is that \u201ccertain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level.\u201dBenjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 4. In practice, the diminished cult value of a religious artefact (an icon no longer venerated) increases the artefact\u2019s exhibition value as art created for the spectators\u2019 appreciation, because \u201cit is easier to exhibit a portrait bust, that can be sent here and there [to museums], than to exhibit the statue of a divinity that has its fixed place in the interior of a temple.\u201dBenjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 4. The mechanical reproduction of a work of art voids its cult value, because removal from a fixed, private space (a temple) and placement in mobile, public space (a museum) allows exhibiting the art to many spectators. Further explaining the transition from cult value to exhibition value, Benjamin said that in \u201cthe photographic image, exhibition value, for the first time, shows its superiority to cult value.\u201dBenjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 4. In emphasising exhibition value, \u201cthe work of art becomes a creation with entirely new functions\u201d, which \u201clater may be recognized as incidental\u201d to the original purpose for which the artist created the objet d\u2019art.Benjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 4. As a medium of artistic production, the cinema (moving pictures) does not create cult value for the motion picture, itself, because \u201cthe audience\u2019s identification with the actor is really an identification with the camera. Consequently, the audience takes the position of the camera; its approach is that of testing. This is not the approach to which cult values may be exposed.\u201d Therefore, \u201cthe film makes the cult value recede into the background, not only by putting the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that, at the movies, this [critical] position requires no attention.\u201dBenjamin, Walter. \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935) p. 5\u20136. ==Art as politics== The social value of a work of art changes as a society change their value systems; thus the changes in artistic styles and in the cultural tastes of the public follow \"the manner in which human sense-perception is organized [and] the [artistic] medium in which it is accomplished, [which are] determined not only by Nature, but by historical circumstances, as well.\" Despite the socio-cultural effects of mass-produced, reproduction-art upon the aura of the original work of art, Benjamin said that \"the uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition\", which separates the original work of art from the reproduction. That the ritualization of the mechanical reproduction of art also emancipated \"the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual\", thereby increasing the social value of exhibiting works of art, which practice progressed from the private sphere of life, the owner's enjoyment of the aesthetics of the artefacts (usually High Art), to the public sphere of life, wherein the public enjoy the same aesthetics in an art gallery. ==Influence== In the late-twentieth-century television program Ways of Seeing (1972), John Berger proceeded from and developed the themes of \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d (1935), to explain the contemporary representations of social class and racial caste inherent to the politics and production of art. That in transforming a work of art into a commodity, the modern means of artistic production and of artistic reproduction have destroyed the aesthetic, cultural, and political authority of art: \u201cFor the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free\u201d, because they are commercial products that lack the aura of authenticity of the original objet d\u2019art.Berger, John.
