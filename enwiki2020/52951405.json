    "text": "A map of what happened at the Kraft State Bank Robbery The Kraft State Bank robbery occurred on October 20, 1931 in Menomonie, Wisconsin when Charles Preston Harmon, Frank Webber, Francis Keating and Tommy Holden stole US$90,000 ($1,421,094.08 in 2016) dollars from the Kraft State Bank. At 9:15 am, the three men drove up to the Kraft State Bank in a 1928 Phaeton model L Lincoln, and Charles Preston Harmon, Francis Keating and Tommy Holden walked into the bank. They forced all the people at the bank to lay down on the floor while the money was taken being taken from the vault. In the process, the bank's proprietor, William F. Kraft, and Charles Preston Harmon were wounded. Their robbery was ended when guard Vernon Townsend tripped the alarm. The robbers fled with $90,000 and two hostages, James Kraft and Mrs. A.W. Schafer. However, Mrs. Schafer was left behind when she tripped and fell. They sped off, coming under fire by restaurateur Winfield Kern, Vernon Townsend, and Farmers Store clerk Ed Grutt (also spelled Grudt), with Frank Webber returning fire. In the firefight, Frank Webber was killed. As the robbers fled down U.S. Route 12, pursued by armed vigilantes and the sheriff, Ike Harmon, they paused on Suckow Road to throw Webber's dead body onto the road and kill James Kraft. Shortly afterwards, they threw Charles Preston Harmon onto the road, where he died soon after. The two men disappeared soon after. In the ensuing hunt, District Attorney A. W. Galvin accused Richard Newman and Leonard Hankins of being the robbers, but they were found innocent. Richard Newman, when asked \"Have you been through Menomonie, Wisconsin?\"replied, \"I have been through Menomonie, yes, sir.\" Then the prosecutor asked \"Isn't it a fact that on Oct. 18, 1931, you and Hankins entered the Kraft State Bank at Menomonie, Wisconsin with guns in your hands?\" Newburn attempted to answer, \"Mr. Compton, I\u2026\" Compton yelled, \"Answer that 'yes' or 'no'!\" To which Newburn replied, \"It is not a fact, no sir, I never robbed a bank in my life in no town or no place.\" At which point they were found innocent. The hunt finally ended eight months later, when the last two robbers, Francis Keating and Tommy Holden were apprehended on a Kansas City, Missouri golf course and sent to Leavenworth Prison. == References == Category:Bank robberies Category:1931 crimes in the United States Category:October 1931 events Category:1931 in Wisconsin Category:Dunn County, Wisconsin Category:Robberies in the United States ",
