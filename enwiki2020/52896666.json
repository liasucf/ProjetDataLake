It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. ==History== Amaliegade 14 was built for justice councilor Kr\u00f8yer in 1755. It was designed by Niels Eigtved who a few years prior had also created the masterplan for the new district Frederiksstaden. Frederik Moltke, who would later serve as Privy Councillor from 1810 to 1914, lived in the building from 1799 to 1810. He was a close friend of the poet Johannes Ewald. David Baruch Adler, a grocer, banker and politician, lived in the building from 1870 to 1873. The painter Kristian Zahrtmann lived on the third floor from 1893 to 1910. The Swiss Embassy has later been based in the building but moved to Hellerup in 2015. Danish Maritime, an industry organisation for manufacturers of ships and maritime equipment, was based on the first floor from 2015 until 31 December 2017. ==Architecture== The building is seven bays wide and has a three-bay median risalit. The facade is divided horizontally by a cornice between the first and second floor. Under the roof runs another cornice supported by corbels. The complex also comprises a seven bay long side wing and a five-bay rear wing. ==Today== The building is owned by Ejendomsselskabet Amaliegade 14-16 ApS. A number of companies are based in it, including Portchain. ==See also== * Listed buildings in Copenhagen Municipality ==References== ==External links== * Amaliegade 14 at Jeudan Category:Frederiksstaden Category:Listed buildings and structures in Copenhagen Category:Buildings and structures in Denmark associated with the Moltke family ",
