In their first season under head coach Mike Price, the Cougars compiled a 6\u20135 record (3\u20135 in Pac-10, tied for seventh), and outscored their opponents 351 to 268. The team's statistical leaders included Aaron Garcia with 2,741 passing yards, Steve Broussard with 1,237 rushing yards, and Tim Stallworth with 548 receiving yards. The Cougars won their first four games, then were 6\u20131 and ranked fifteenth in the AP poll, but lost their final four games. Following the departure of head coach Dennis Erickson for Miami in early March, Price was hired a week later; a former Cougar player and assistant, he was previously the head coach for eight years in the Big Sky Conference at Weber State in Ogden, Utah. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL Draft== Six Cougars were selected in the 1990 NFL Draft. {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center\" |- |Steve Broussard |RB |1 |20 |Atlanta Falcons |- |Tony Savage |DT |5 |112 |New York Jets |- |Tim Stallworth |WR |6 |161 |Los Angeles Rams |- |Dan Grayson |LB |7 |182 |Pittsburgh Steelers |- |Doug Wellsandt |TE |8 |204 |Cincinnati Bengals |- |Tim Downing |DE |11 |302 |New York Giants |} : * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Category:1989 in sports in Washington (state) ",
