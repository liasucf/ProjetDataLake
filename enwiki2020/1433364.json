    "text": "2013 Policy address. 2013 Policy address. Policy Address () is the annual address by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong (Governor prior to the handover). The practice of giving annual policy address is mandated under Article 64 of the Basic Law, requiring the government to \"present regular policy addresses to the Council\". The policy address was first introduced during the colonial period by Governor Sir Murray MacLehose in 1972 as \"Address by His Excellency the Governor\". It was modelled after the Queen's Speech in the United Kingdom and aimed to strengthen the communications with Hong Kong residents after the Hong Kong 1967 Leftist riots. It used to be addressed in October, on the opening of the Legislative Council. In 2002, former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa changed it unilaterally to January, but it was returned to October by his successor, Donald Tsang. After Leung Chun-ying succeeded Tsang in 2012, he changed the policy address back to January. It was again changed back to October after Carrie Lam became Chief Executive in 2017. Two weeks after the address, the chairman of the House Committee of the Legislative Council moves a Motion of Thanks, similar to Address in Reply motions in other legislatures, and members of the Council debate the Policy Address. Most people see the policy address as useful and a way of predicting how the Chief Executive will operate. ==List of policy addresses== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left;\" |- ! width=75px| Year || width=110px| Given by || English title || Chinese title |- | 2019 || Carrie Lam || \"Treasure Hong Kong: Our Home\" || \u73cd\u60dc\u9999\u6e2f \u5171\u5efa\u5bb6\u5712 |- | 2018 || Carrie Lam || \"Striving Ahead; Rekindling Hope\" || \u5805\u5b9a\u524d\u884c \u71c3\u9ede\u5e0c\u671b |- | 2017 || Carrie Lam || \"We Connect for Hope and Happiness\" || \u4e00\u8d77\u540c\u884c \u64c1\u62b1\u5e0c\u671b \u5206\u4eab\u5feb\u6a02 |- | 2017 || Leung Chun-ying || \"Make Best Use of Opportunities; Develop the Economy; Improve People\u2019s Livelihood; Build an Inclusive Society\" || \u7528\u597d\u6a5f\u9047 \u767c\u5c55\u7d93\u6fdf \u6539\u5584\u6c11\u751f \u548c\u8ae7\u5171\u878d |- | 2016 || Leung Chun-ying || \"Innovate for the Economy; Improve Livelihood; Foster Harmony; Share Prosperity\" || \u5275\u65b0\u7d93\u6fdf \u6539\u5584\u6c11\u751f \u4fc3\u9032\u548c\u8ae7 \u7e41\u69ae\u5171\u4eab |- | 2015 || Leung Chun-ying || \"Uphold the Rule of Law; Seize the Opportunities; Make the Right Choices\" || \u91cd\u6cd5\u6cbb \u638c\u6a5f\u9047 \u4f5c\u6289\u64c7 |- | 2014 || Leung Chun- ying || \"Support the Needy; Let Youth Flourish; Unleash Hong Kong's Potential\" || \u8b93\u6709\u9700\u8981\u7684 \u5f97\u5230\u652f\u63f4 \u8b93\u5e74\u9752\u7684 \u5404\u5c55\u6240\u9577 \u8b93\u9999\u6e2f \u5f97\u4ee5\u767c\u63ee |- | 2013 || Leung Chun-ying || \"Seek Change; Maintain Stability; Serve the People with Pragmatism\" || \u7a69\u4e2d\u6c42\u8b8a \u52d9\u5be6\u70ba\u6c11 |- | 2011\u201312 || Donald Tsang || \"From Strength to Strength\" || \u7e7c\u5f80\u958b\u4f86 |- | 2010\u201311 || Donald Tsang || \"Sharing Prosperity for a Caring Society\" || \u6c11\u5fc3\u6211\u5fc3 \u540c\u821f\u5171\u6fdf \u7e41\u69ae\u5171\u4eab |- | 2009\u201310 || Donald Tsang || \"Breaking New Ground Together\" || \u7fa3\u7b56\u5275\u65b0\u5929 |- | 2008\u201309 || Donald Tsang || \"Embracing New Challenges\" || \u8fce\u63a5\u65b0\u6311\u6230 |- | 2007\u201308 || Donald Tsang || \"A New Direction for Hong Kong\" || \u9999\u6e2f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411 |- | 2006\u201307 || Donald Tsang || \"Proactive; Pragmatic; Always People First\" || \u4ee5\u6c11\u70ba\u672c \u52d9\u5be6\u9032\u53d6 |- | 2005\u201306 || Donald Tsang || \"Strong Governance For the People\" || \u5f37\u653f\u52f5\u6cbb \u798f\u70ba\u6c11\u958b |- | 2005 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Working Together for Economic Development and Social Harmony\" || \u5408\u529b\u767c\u5c55\u7d93\u6fdf \u5171\u5efa\u548c\u8ae7\u793e\u6703 |- | 2004 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Seizing Opportunities for Development; Promoting People-based Governance\" || \u628a\u63e1\u767c\u5c55\u6a5f\u9047 \u63a8\u52d5\u6c11\u672c\u65bd\u653f |- | 2003 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Capitalising on Our Advantages Revitalising Our Economy\" || \u5584\u7528\u9999\u6e2f\u512a\u52e2 \u5171\u540c\u632f\u8208\u7d93\u6fdf |- | 2001 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Building on our Strengths; Investing in our Future\" || \u978f\u56fa\u5be6\u529b \u6295\u8cc7\u672a\u4f86 |- | 2000 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Serving the Community; Sharing Common Goals\" || \u4ee5\u6c11\u70ba\u672c \u540c\u5fc3\u540c\u5fb7 |- | 1999 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Quality People; Quality Home\" || \u57f9\u80b2\u512a\u79c0\u4eba\u624d \u5efa\u8a2d\u7f8e\u597d\u5bb6\u5712 |- | 1998 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"From Adversity to Opportunity\" || \u7fa3\u7b56\u7fa3\u529b \u8f49\u5371\u70ba\u6a5f |- | 1997 || Tung Chee-hwa || \"Building Hong Kong For A New Era\" || \u5171\u5275\u9999\u6e2f\u65b0\u7d00\u5143 |- | 1996 || Chris Patten|| \"Hong Kong: Transition\" || \u904e\u6e21\u4e2d\u7684\u9999\u6e2f |- | 1995 || Chris Patten || \"Hong Kong: Our Work Together\" || \u540c\u5fc3\u5354\u529b\u5efa\u9999\u6e2f |- | 1994 || Chris Patten || \"Hong Kong: A Thousand Days and Beyond\" || \u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u638c\u63e1\u5343\u65e5 \u8de8\u8d8a\u4e5d\u4e03 |- | 1993 || Chris Patten || \"Hong Kong: Today's Success, Tomorrow's Challenges\" || \u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u7acb\u57fa\u4eca\u65e5 \u958b\u62d3\u660e\u5929 |- | 1992 || Chris Patten || \"Our Next Five Years: The Agenda for Hong Kong\" || \u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u672a\u4f86\uff1a\u4e94\u5e74\u5927\u8a08\u5c55\u65b0\u7337 |} There were no titles for the Policy Addresses before 1992. ==See also== * State of the Union address ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Politics of Hong Kong ",
