The song reached number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 5 on the Mainstream Rock charts. A music video directed by Pete Angelus was shot to promote the single, and the song was included on the greatest hits compilation Greatest Hits 1990\u20131999: A Tribute to a Work in Progress. An acoustic rendition of the song is also featured on Croweology, which included nineteen newly recorded versions of the Black Crowes most popular songs. On July 30, 2008, the Black Crowes filed a lawsuit against country singer Gretchen Wilson, claiming that she infringed upon their copyright for the song \"Jealous Again.\" The suit also included claims against her label, her publisher, and TNT, who is using the song in promotional commercials. They claim that Wilson copied the Crowes hit when she recorded \"Work Hard, Play Harder.\" The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum http://www.ocregister.com/soundcheck/http-480854-strong-wilson.html and Black Crowes members Chris and Rich Robinson were given songwriting credits on \"Work Hard, Play Harder.\"http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/redneck-woman- gretchen-wilsons-search-for-radio-redemption/Content?oid=1227357 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 songs Category:1990 debut singles Category:The Black Crowes songs Category:Songs written by Chris Robinson (singer) Category:Songs written by Rich Robinson ",
