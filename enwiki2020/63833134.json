    "text": "This page documents confirmed tornadoes from May to July 2020 via various weather forecast offices of the National Weather Service. Based on the 1991\u20132010 averaging period, 276 tornadoes occur across the United States throughout May and 243 in June. The climatological peak for tornadic activity in the country, May features a risk area that is concentrated throughout the U.S. Great Plains, especially in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This is a shift from earlier months where the highest concentration of tornadoes is focused around the U.S. Gulf Coast. Historical data shows a substantial drop in the number of violent (EF4+) tornadoes in May versus April, likely due to the loss of the amplified winter jet stream, and perhaps as a result of tornadoes tracking over more sparsely populated areas. However, intense tornadoes are still possible in any month of the year. May 2020 proved to be one of the least active on record, with only 65 confirmed tornadoes. This was the lowest since at least 1970 when 88 tornadoes were confirmed. No moderate- or high-risk outlooks were issued by the Storm Prediction Center throughout the month, a first since archives of outlooks began in 2002. June was even less active, with only 50 confirmed tornadoes. This was third least active June on record. In addition, only one EF2+ tornado was confirmed during June, the lowest amount on record. Tornado counts listed below are considered preliminary until final publication in the database of the National Centers for Environmental Information. ==United States yearly total== ==May== ===May 3 event=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |+ List of confirmed tornadoes \u2013 Sunday, May 3, 2020 ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%; text- align:center;\"|EF# ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%; text- align:center;\"|State ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time (UTC) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary |- | bgcolor=\"\" | EF1 |Marston |New Madrid |MO | |18:55\u201319:01 | | |Several farm buildings were destroyed and had their concrete pillars pulled from the ground.
