There's a holy gravitas that resonates within this Louisiana native's pipes that we can't help but be drawn in.\" Jeanie Law of Breathcast summarized that \"Lauren Daigle's debut release How Can It Be on Centricity Music will serve as a breath of fresh air for music lovers with its raw emotion, honest lyrics, and Daigle's infectious voice.\" In a nine out of ten review by Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings describes, \"Paul Mabury's production is impeccable, Lauren's vocals are richly expressive, and all in all 'How Can It Be' is an inspiring full length debut from a singer who will surely be here for the long haul.\" Michael Dalton, in a four out of five review from The Phantom Tollbooth, says, \"The voice I hear on Lauren Daigle\u2019s debut, How Can it Be, reminds me of Adele and the International House of Prayer\u2019s, Misty Edwards.
