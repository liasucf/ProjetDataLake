    "text": "The Japanese cocktail is a three-ingredient cocktail made from cognac, orgeat, and bitters, e.g. Angostura bitters. It has been described as \"like an Old Fashioned with a rich and nutty twist.\" The Japanese cocktail first appeared in Jerry Thomas's 1862 How to Mix Drinks. It is speculated that perhaps the drink's name originated from visits paid to Thomas's New York City bar on Broadway by the translator for Japan's first diplomatic mission to America, Tateishi Onojirou Noriyuki. ==References== Category:Spirit-forward cocktails Category:Three-ingredient cocktails ",
