He is member in Locomotiv GT and was member in Omega, a prominent personality of the Hungarian pop music. == Biography == Childhood Born in Budapest in 1948, his parents are G\u00e9za Presser and Uhrman Elvira. His father worked as a poultry dealer in the Great Market hall at Klauz\u00e1l square. After school his son, G\u00e1bor went out to help him. G\u00e1bor Presser started playing the piano at the age of four, the pianist Imre Antal also acknowledged the child's talents and predicted that he would become a great artist. He finished the primary school in Kert\u00e9sz street, and subsequently started his studies at the Music High School, meanwhile he played piano at a street dancing school in Kap\u00e1s street for a 14 HUF hourly rate. He started to deal with composing as a teenager. The family lived at Dob street 46/B on the first floor, and above their home lived the composer and pianist Rezs\u0151 Seress. Presser was already a teenager, and he often talked up Seress who showed him records and sheet music as well. Seress was listening every day from 2 pm to 6 pm different arrangements of the Gloomy Sunday, which were broadcast to the surrounding homes. Presser later reflected to these memories in his song Plafon, which Lajos Parti Nagy wrote the text. Omega (1967\u20131971) (band) Presser during high school was only interested in classical music at the time, but his classmate Tam\u00e1s Mih\u00e1ly took him to concerts of the band Scampolo, where he was occasionally playing in. Starting 1967 Presser started to write his own songs for Omega (until then they were only playing covers of foreign hits.) In the summer, he became one of their musicians playing on keyboards. The band tried out a unique arrangements: no solo guitarist, but two keyboardists. The arrangement was not very successful and Presser was replaced by Gy\u00f6rgy Moln\u00e1r guitarist. During this time, he played with Scampolo and started writing songs for L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kom\u00e1r. He was called back to be part of the band in 1968, just before the band's British tour. After a few singles, he became the main songwriter of Omega's first three albums and some of those he sang himself. After Presser left the band (1971) he played again live with his bandmates on the Omega\u2013LGT\u2013Beatrice tour in 1980, at the 25 year anniversary concert in 1987, and later in 1994 and 1999. He also contributed to Omega's album titled Trans and Dance as songwriter for two songs, and as guest keyboardist. Locomotiv GT (1971\u20131984) Presser wanted more than to play Omega's music and quit the band to form Locomotiv GT with bass player K\u00e1roly Frenreisz, guitarist Tam\u00e1s Barta, and drummer J\u00f3zsef Laux. It was the first Hungarian so called 'supergroup'. All of the founding members, except Presser, left the group by 1977. The final act consists of Presser, Tam\u00e1s Soml\u00f3, J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csony and J\u00e1nos Solti. Presser wrote or co-wrote most of LGT's songs. Additionally, Presser also got involved in theater work. His first musical appeared at the V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z (Comedy Theatre of Budapest) in Budapest, an adaptation of Tibor D\u00e9ry's novel titled An Imaginary Report from an American Pop Festival. Presser has written music for several theatre pieces at the Comedy Theatre of Budapest. He has been the music director of the theatre since 1978 and has his own evening shows there. His first solo album came out in 1982, titled Electromantic, which was originally the music for a ballet piece titled The Rehearsal written for electric instruments. Part of the music was used as a title song for BBC's news program. La Baletta No. 2. was used as the title piece for the Budapest Regional News. Since the 1970s Presser has written music for and collaborated with many Hungarian artists such as Sarolta Zalatnay, Ferenc Demj\u00e9n, Andr\u00e1s Kern, Gyula Vikid\u00e1l, Zor\u00e1n, Kati Kov\u00e1cs, Kl\u00e1ri Katona, and S\u00e1ndor R\u00e9v\u00e9sz. The last LGT album was released in 1984. Past LGT years Presser started a new theatre production, which resulted in \u2018A padl\u00e1s\u2019 (The Attic) in 1988. The first real Presser album was released in 1994 titled \u2018Csak dalok\u2019 (\u2018Only Tunes\u2019) that was followed by Kis t\u00f6rt\u00e9netek (\u2018Little Stories\u2019) in 1996. Presser had 9 full house nights at the Comedy Theatre of Budapest in 1995, after them he stopped performing until 2001 when he did a 50 concert tour (this was recorded on CD/DVD). After the year 1998 Presser has been releasing a new compilation album every couple of years. Even though LGT dissolved in the 80s, they had a farewell concert in 1992 (which was also released on a CD). They released two albums with new material in 1997 and in 2002. They had a free concert in 1999, organized a LGT festival in 2002, and performed as the opening at the famous Sziget Festival. They also performed a series of concerts in 2013. In 2009, Presser himself held a concert celebrating his 40-year career with many musician guests. Some of the material from this concert is available on CD. In the next 2 years Presser worked on a 74-minute album that was released in 2011, which consists of Lajos Parti Nagy\u2019s poetry made into music. In 2013, a Kanye West song, \u2018New Slaves\u2019, was nominated for a Grammy that contained about a minute long sample of Omega's big hit from 45 years ago Gy\u00f6ngyhaj\u00fa l\u00e1ny (music written by Presser). In 2015, Presser released an album \u2018Szeren\u00e1d helyett\u2019 that lead the hit list on iTunes. == Albums == This is a simplified list that does not contain all the albums Presser appeared as an artist.
