    "text": "A credal set is a set of probability distributionsLevi, I. (1980). The Enterprise of Knowledge. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. or, more generally, a set of (possibly finitely additive) probability measures. A credal set is often assumed or constructed to be a closed convex set. It is intended to express uncertainty or doubt about the probability model that should be used, or to convey the beliefs of a Bayesian agent about the possible states of the world.Cozman, F. (1999). Theory of Sets of Probabilities (and related models) in a Nutshell . If a credal set K(X) is closed and convex, then, by the Krein\u2013Milman theorem, it can be equivalently described by its extreme points \\mathrm{ext}[K(X)]. In that case, the expectation for a function f of X with respect to the credal set K(X) forms a closed interval [\\underline{E}[f],\\overline{E}[f , whose lower bound is called the lower prevision of f, and whose upper bound is called the upper prevision of f: :\\underline{E}[f]=\\min_{\\mu\\in K(X)} \\int f \\, d\\mu=\\min_{\\mu\\in \\mathrm{ext}[K(X)]} \\int f \\, d\\mu where \\mu denotes a probability measure, and with a similar expression for \\overline{E}[f] (just replace \\min by \\max in the above expression). If X is a categorical variable, then the credal set K(X) can be considered as a set of probability mass functions over X. If additionally K(X) is also closed and convex, then the lower prevision of a function f of X can be simply evaluated as: :\\underline{E}[f]=\\min_{p\\in \\mathrm{ext}[K(X)]} \\sum_x f(x) p(x) where p denotes a probability mass function. It is easy to see that a credal set over a Boolean variable X cannot have more than two extreme points (because the only closed convex sets in \\mathbb{R} are closed intervals), while credal sets over variables X that can take three or more values can have any arbitrary number of extreme points. ==See also== * Imprecise probability * Dempster\u2013Shafer theory * Probability box * Robust Bayes analysis * Upper and lower probabilities ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Bayesian inference Category:Probability bounds analysis ",
