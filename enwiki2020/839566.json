    "text": "Gr\u00ed\u00f0r (or Gr\u00edd) is a j\u00f6tunn in Norse mythology. She is the mother of V\u00ed\u00f0arr the silent and the consort of O\u00f0inn. == Name == The poetic Old Norse name Gr\u00ed\u00f0r has been translated as \"vehemence, violence, or impetuosity\". Its etymology is unclear. == Attestations == === Prose Edda === In Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l (The Language of Poetry), Gr\u00ed\u00f0r is portrayed as equipping the thunder-god Thor with her belt of strength, her iron glove, and her staff Gr\u00eddarv\u00f6l (Gr\u00ed\u00f0r's-staff) on Thor's journey to the abode of Geirr\u00f6\u00f0r. Gr\u00ed\u00f0r is also mentioned in a list of troll-wives (\"I shall list the names of troll-wives. Grid and Gnissa, Gryla...\"). === Viking Age === Gr\u00eddarv\u00f6l (Gr\u00ed\u00f0r's-staff) is also mentioned in the poem \u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa by the late 10th-century skald Eil\u00edfr Go\u00f0r\u00fanarson. Gr\u00ed\u00f0r appears in 10th-century kennings for 'wolf' (the steed of troll-wife) and for 'axe' (that which is dangerous to the life-protector, i.e. shield or helmet). === Other texts === Saxo Grammaticus refers to her as Grytha, the wife of the legendary king Dan I of Denmark, \"a matron most highly revered among the Teutons\". A witch of the same name appears in Illuga saga Gr\u00ed\u00f0arf\u00f3stra. == Theory == Her role as the donor of information and necessary items to the hero has been analyzed by folklorists as a commonplace of folk narrative. ==Notes== ==References== === Bibliography === * * * * * Category:G\u00fdgjar ",
