Billboard - the International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment, 118, 25-27.\"Man\u00e1.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 Feb. 2016. Man\u00e1 is considered one of the best-selling Latin music artists with over 25 million records sold worldwide. The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, guitarist Sergio Vall\u00edn and bassist Juan Calleros. Man\u00e1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards.:es:Rock de Mexico Man\u00e1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man\u00e1 followed with Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, progressive rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Latin America and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US and around the world. ==History== ===1986\u201389: Formation and early releases=== Fher, lead singer Man\u00e1 was formed in 1986 by Jos\u00e9 Fernando \"Fher\" Olvera (vocals), Ulises (guitars) and Juan Calleros (bass guitar), who had been performing together in a band called Sombrero Verde since the mid-1970s and disbanded in 1983. The three placed an advertisement in the local Guadalajara newspaper looking for a drummer to complete a new band, to which fifteen-year-old Alex Gonz\u00e1lez applied and soon joined the group. Man\u00e1's first album was titled \"Man\u00e1 released on May 12, 1987 on A& M Records. Man\u00e1 signed to PolyGram, but became unhappy with the direction the label was taking the band and switched to Warner Music shortly before the release of the group's 2nd album, Falta Amor. A year passed before the album garnered its first hit single, \"Rayando el Sol\". The group toured heavily in support of the album performing more than 250 times throughout Latin America, including shows in Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. ===1990\u201396: Commercial success=== Rock in Rio Madrid 2012. In 1991, they added two new members to the group, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez on keyboards and C\u00e9sar \"Vampiro\" L\u00f3pez on guitar. Ulises Calleros no longer performed with the group, but became one of their managers. On 27 October 1992, the band released \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, an album that spawned several hits (including \"Vivir Sin Aire,\" \"Oye Mi Amor,\" and \"De Pies a Cabeza\"). The record sold over 3 million copies worldwide and became the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. The band undertook an international tour with 268 concerts in 17 countries. In 1994, L\u00f3pez and Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez left the group due to musical and personal disputes. Fher Olvera and Alex Gonz\u00e1lez felt that their departure offered an opportunity to reinvent the group's sound, and searched throughout Mexico, Spain and Argentina to find a new guitarist. In the meantime, Man\u00e1 released the live album Man\u00e1 en Vivo before choosing Mexican guitarist Sergio Vall\u00edn to replace Calleros and L\u00f3pez. In 1995, the band recorded a Spanish version of Led Zeppelin's \"Fool in the Rain\" for the tribute album Encomium. Lead singer Fher Olvera and Juan Calleros in the background performing at Rock in Rio Madrid 2012. On 25 April 1995, the group released Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran. The album was noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work, which saw the group experimenting with funk and soul music genres. Olvera explained shortly after the release of the album, \"Basically, we're still the same Man\u00e1, but we're going through a funky, soulish stage. We want to have some fun and be a little louder.\" The initial reaction to Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran was mixed and the first single, the funk-influenced \"D\u00e9jame Entrar\", failed to reach the top ten on the Mexican Singles Chart. However, the album later caught on and sold 500,000 copies in the United States alone within five months of release. ===1997\u20132007: Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor, and Amar es Combatir=== In 1997, the group released Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, an album about the highs and lows of love, with songs like \"Clavado en un bar\" and \"En el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s,\" recorded in Puerto Vallarta and released simultaneously in 36 countries. The recording received a Grammy Award as Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The group performed acoustically in Miami for Latin America's MTV Unplugged program. A final version of the performance was mixed at Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, and the band released Man\u00e1 MTV Unplugged on 22 June 1999. In the summer of 1999, the band co-headlined an 18-city tour of the United States with Carlos Santana. Man\u00e1 also appeared on Santana's 1999 album Supernatural on the song \"Coraz\u00f3n Espinado\". In 2002, in an effort to blend their sound with that of rock and roll from the sixties and seventies, the band recorded Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor. They won their fourth Grammy for the album. The band released a new version of \"Eres mi Religi\u00f3n\" for the Italian market in 2003, as a duet with Italian musician Zucchero, and also performed with Zucchero in a new recording of his \"Baila Morena\". This same year they participated in the annual Pavarotti & Friends concert, along with Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin, Andrea Bocelli, Zucchero and Bono.

It reached #4 on the Billboard Top 200 in its first week, selling over 60,000 copies in the first week. Their first single off the album, \"Labios Compartidos\", rose to the top of the music charts upon its debut in July, when the group played the song live at the Premios Juventud. Amar es Combatir has sold over 644,000 copies, and the Amar es Combatir Tour in promotion of the album grossed more than $35 million.

The record's release was delayed several times, initially scheduled for a Fall 2010 release, which was later changed to December 2010, and finally changed to April 2011. The band explained that Drama y Luz was not ready for fans and spent time during the delays putting the finishing touches on the record. Themes addressed on the album include love, hope, addiction, and racism. The first single from the album, \"Lluvia al Coraz\u00f3n\", became the band's sixth song to reach number one on the Billboard Latin Songs chart, as well as its eighth song to top the magazine's Latin Pop Songs chart. === 2013\u2013present: Cama Incendiada / Rayando el sol Tour === In 2016, Man\u00e1 was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On 29 March 2007, Puerto Rico's Channel 4, WAPA's News program, reported that Man\u00e1 publicly supported Puerto Rico's prospective independence from the United States. In an interview that followed the aforementioned news announcement, the members of Man\u00e1 were interviewed by Channel 4 (WAPA) journalist, Rafael Len\u00edn L\u00f3pez, who asked them what they thought about Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 members confirmed that they support the Puerto Rican Independence Movement and favor greater sovereignty for the Latin American and Caribbean island-nation. Various of their songs have political inspirations. The liner notes for \"Me Voy a Convertir en Un Ave,\" on the album Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, for example, notes that the song is \"inspired by the book Pedro y el capit\u00e1n by Mario Benedetti and dedicated to all those who, for defending an ideal of justice, are persecuted or find themselves imprisoned.
