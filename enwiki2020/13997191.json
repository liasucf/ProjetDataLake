    "text": "Ar\u00edstides Maragliano is referred to as the 'unknown Justice' since very little is known about this Spanish-born member of Puerto Rico's highest court under Spanish rule, the 'Audiencia Territorial'. He is also the only Spaniard who was appointed to the highest court under American rule. It is believed that he was appointed on October 27, 1898, the same day that Jos\u00e9 Severo Qui\u00f1ones and Jos\u00e9 Conrado Hern\u00e1ndez were appointed magistrates. For unknown reasons, he resigned on March 17, 1899. ==Sources== *La Justicia en sus Manos, by Luis Rafael Rivera Category:Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican lawyers Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
