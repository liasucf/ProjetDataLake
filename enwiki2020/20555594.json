    "text": "The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class F was a class of 2-8-0 steam locomotives in service between 1906 and 1928. ==History== No. 1273 in photographic grey livery based on LNWR lined black livery George Whale had rebuilt 26 of the Class B compound 0-8-0s with the simple addition of a leading pony truck between 1904-1908 to what would from 1911 become Class E. However, from 1906 rebuilds of Class Bs were given a larger 5'2\" diameter boilers, and ten were so rebuilt. To these was added a pair of rebuilds of Class Es (Nos 1038 in 1907 and 647 in 1908). From 1921, the LNWR started rebuilding the Class Fs into Class G1 superheated 0-8-0s, and by the grouping of 1923, six had been rebuilt. The remaining six were allocated the LMS numbers 9610-5. The LMS rebuilt a further four to G1s, between 1923-5. The remaining pair were withdrawn in 1927 and 1928 without being rebuilt. None was preserved. ==List of locomotives== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !LNWR no. !!Origin !!LMS no. !!Fate !!Notes |- |899 ||Rebuilt from B 1907 ||(9610) ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |352 ||Rebuilt from B 1907 ||(9611) ||Withdrawn 1927 || |- |2114 ||Rebuilt from B 1908 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1922 || |- |906 ||Rebuilt from B 1907 ||(9612) ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |1036 ||Rebuilt from B 1907 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |1038 ||Rebuilt from E 1907 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |2570 ||Rebuilt from B 1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |1247 ||Rebuilt from B 1906 ||(9613) ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |1273 ||Rebuilt from B 1906 ||9614 ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |2573 ||Rebuilt from B 1908 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1922 || |- |647 ||Rebuilt from E 1908 ||(9615) ||Rebuilt to G1 1925 || |- |1369 ||Rebuilt from B 1907 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1922 || |} LMS numbers in parentheses were not carried prior to rebuilding as G1 or withdrawal. ==Notes== ==References== * == Further reading == * Bob Essery & David Jenkinson An Illustrated Review of LMS Locomotives Vol. 2 Absorbed Pre- Group Classes Western and Central Divisions * Edward Talbot, The London & North Western Railway Eight-Coupled Goods Engines * Willie Yeadon, Yeadon's Compendium of LNWR Locomotives Vol 2 Goods Tender Engines == External links == * LNWRS Webb page on the Class Fs F Category:2-8-0 locomotives Category:Compound locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1906 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:1\u2032D n4v locomotives ",
