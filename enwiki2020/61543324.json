    "text": "Reading Crown Court is a judicial facility in Reading, Berkshire. It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building, which was designed by John Clacy in the Baroque revival style, was completed in 1861. It was used for the assize courts from 1867 when Abingdon County Hall ceded that role To Reading. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place for Berkshire County Council. The administrative staff and committee rooms of the County Council were accommodated in the Shire Hall next door. In 1980 the council moved to a new Shire Hall at Shinfield Park and subsequently it was used solely as a Crown Court. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Reading Category:Crown Courts ",
