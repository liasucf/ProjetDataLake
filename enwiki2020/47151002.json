The association seeks to serve the interests of women and children in rural areas in Australia through a network of local branches. Established in 1922, local branches provide friendship and mutual support to their members while contributing to the betterment of life in their local communities. Over time, many branches have evolved to include support for wider issues such as domestic violence campaigns and fund-raising for international initiatives such as orphanages. In 2019 the QWCA received a Queensland Greats Award from the Queensland Government.2019 Queensland Greats recipients , Queensland Government website. Retrieved 11 June 2019. == History == On 8\u201311 August 1922, the Brisbane Women's Club held an open conference for countrywomen in Brisbane's Albert Hall during the Exhibition (a time when many country people visited Brisbane). The conference was opened by Lady Forster, wife of Australian Governor-General and the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan attended. On 11 August 1922, the outcome of the conference was to establish the Queensland Country Women's Association.Pagliano, 3 Ruth Beatrice Fairfax was elected the first President. The first meeting of the Toowoomba branch was held at the Toowoomba Town Hall on 12 September 1922. Ruth Fairfax attended and spoke about the objectives of the organisation. The meeting resolved to hold a conference as soon as there were sufficient representatives to attend. The objectives of the association were broad but included some specific items:Pagliano, 6 > 1\\. To improve welfare and conditions of women and children in the country > > 2\\. To draw together all women, girls, and children in Country Districts. > > 3\\. To bring opportunities for recreation and enjoyment within reach of all > Members. > > 4\\. To encourage the active study of Local, Municipal and State affairs and > to promote a wise and kindly spirit. > > 5\\. To improve educational facilities in the Country. > > 6\\. To secure better provision for the safeguarding of Public Health > especially of children, and the securing of more adequate Medical and > Hospital facilities for Country Districts.\" There was a call for a design for a badge and the winner was Mrs Mabel Chandler of Burra Burri who proposed the letters CWA within a large letter \"Q\"; this design is still used as the organisation's logo. It was decided that the silver and royal blue should be adopted as the colours for the organisation. Many QCWA buildings are painted royal blue and white to approximate the chosen colours. The Queensland chapter was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2017 the QWCA created its own perfume, '1922', to mark its 95th anniversary. It was released at 2017 Ekka and was developed by Damask Perfumery in Brisbane. The artwork and branding of the bottle was supplied by Brisbane watercolour artist Michelle Grayson. In 2019 the QWCA received a Queensland Greats Award from the Queensland Government. == Branches == As at December 2018, the QWCA has over 240 branches throughout Queensland.
