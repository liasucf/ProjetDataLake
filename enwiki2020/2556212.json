    "text": "Ice Harbor Lock and Dam is a hydroelectric, concrete gravity run-of-the-river dam on the Snake River in Walla Walla and Franklin counties in the U.S. state of Washington. The dam is located northeast of the town of Burbank and east of Pasco, river mile 9.7. Its name comes from a tiny bay in the river where boats once tied up to wait for upstream ice-jams to break up. Construction began in June 1955. The main structure and three generators were completed in 1961, with an additional three generators finished in 1976. Generating capacity is 603 megawatts, with an overload capacity of 693 MW. The spillway has ten gates and is long. ==Dam system== Ice Harbor Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams. ==Visitor center== Inside the Dam on the South side of the river is a large visitor center that has been recently updated to include a new film \"The Snake - River of Life\" and a new modern interactive touch screen kiosk with information on the dam and recreational opportunities in the area. The visitor center also has a fish ladder viewing room which offers an excellent view of migrating Salmon, Steelhead and Shad. Due to security, visitors must pass through the security gate to gain access. ==Surrounding water bodies== Lake Sacajawea, named for Sacajawea, is formed behind the dam. The lake stretches to the base of Lower Monumental Dam, upstream. The Wallula Channel, formed from the backup of Snake River entering the Columbia River just southeast of Pasco, runs downstream from the base of the dam. ; Navigation lock * Single-lift * wide * long ==Climate== The highest temperature ever measured in Washington state, at , was recorded at Ice Harbor Dam on August 5, 1961.
