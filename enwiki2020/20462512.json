The name comes from the word \u043c\u0435\u0449\u0440\u0430 meshtra, \"master\", from Latin magister. Meshterski served a linguistically isolating purpose, enabling the builders to communicate in secrecy, and a socially isolating purpose, emphasizing the builders' perceived supremacy over their contractors.\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, \"\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 I\". ==Distribution and vocabulary== The sociolect emerged among the Bulgarian masons in southwestern Macedonia, adjacent to the Albanian lands. As a result, it includes a large number of Albanian loanwords, e.g. \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 buka, \"bread\", from buk\u0451; \u0433\u044f\u0445\u0442\u0430 gyahta, \"cheese\", from djath\u00eb; \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c meram, \"to take\", from marr. There are much fewer loans from Greek (e.g. \u043b\u0430\u0448\u043c\u0430 lashma, \"mud\", from \u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c0\u03b7 laspi; \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430 karekla, \"chair\", from \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1 kar\u00e9kla) and Turkish (e.g. \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0447 pirinch, \"rice\", from pirin\u00e7; \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b sakal, \"beard\", from sakal).\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, \"\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 II\". Later, the language spread through migration to northeastern Macedonia (the region of Gotse Delchev), the Rhodope Mountains around Smolyan, and the areas of Asenovgrad, Kazanlak and the sub-Balkan valleys. Although loanwords often remained semantically unchanged, the Bulgarian vocabulary in the sociolect was substituted with native metaphors, metonyms and words from different roots, so as to conceal the true meaning to outsiders, e.g. \u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430 mokra (\"wet\", fem.) for \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 voda, \"water\"; \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0447 gledach (\"looker\") for \u043e\u043a\u043e oko, \"eye\", \u043e\u0431\u043b\u043e oblo (\"round\", neut.) for \u044f\u0439\u0446\u0435 yaytse, \"egg\". The lexis of Meshterski included not only professional terms and basic vocabulary, but also other words, including religious terms, such as \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432 Svetliv, \"Luminous\", referring to God or a saint. Meshterski also spread to other social areas: it was borrowed by tinsmiths in at least one village in the Rhodopes, although with a much reduced vocabulary and renamed to Ganamarski.\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, \"\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 III\". Albanian words mediated through Meshterski have also entered informal Bulgarian; these included \u043a\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0432 kekav, \"weak, sickly\" (from keq); \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0438 kinti, \"money, dough\" (from qind, \"hundred\"), \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043c skivam, \"to see, to take a look\" (from shqyrtoj), \u043a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0448 kelesh, \"squirt, mangy fellow\" (from qelesh). ==Examples== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2|Cyrillic||colspan=2|Latin|| |- !Meshterski||Bulgarian||Meshterski||Bulgarian||English |- |\u0412\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0439, \u0440\u0430\u0439\u0447\u043e, \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0439! |\u0412\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0438, \u0441\u043b\u044a\u043d\u0446\u0435, \u0432\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0438! |Vetay, raycho, vetay! |Varvi, slantse, varvi! |Go, Sun, go! |- |\u0428\u0443\u043b\u0435, \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0430! |\u041c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435, \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043b! |Shule, dovetay balta! |Momche, donesi kal! |Boy, bring [some] mud! |} ==See also== * Banja\u010dki, the cant of bricklayers in Podrinje, western Balkans * Purishte, Albanian language sociolect spoken by masons of the Opar region ==Footnotes== ==References== * ==External links== * Short dictionary of Meshterski Category:Cant languages Category:Occupational cryptolects Category:Bulgarian language Category:Dialects of the Bulgarian language ",
