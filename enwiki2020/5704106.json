He was son of a Muslim father, Hudz\u00e4il al S\u00e4huir and of a Christian mother. As a vassal in the Christian kingdom he spent long seasons in the courts of Aragon, Valencia and Granada, on friendly terms with the kings of Aragon and of Castile. After the conquest of the Kingdom of Valencia by James I of Aragon, Al-Azraq signed the Al-Azraq Treaty of 1245, a pact with the Aragonese king by which the Muslim commander could keep control of a series of fortifications including Polop (later the lordship of the Barons of Polop) in the valleys of Alcal\u00e1 and Gallinera. Despite the treaty, Al-Azraq led uprisings in 1248 and 1258, when he made an attempt on the life of James I but was defeated. In 1276 he met his death while besieging Alcoy, at the hands of a Christian native from X\u00e0tiva. == See also == * Moors and Christians of Alcoy == References == Category:1208 births Category:1276 deaths Category:13th-century Arabs Category:13th-century Al- Andalus people Category:Medieval Arabs killed in battle Category:People of the Reconquista ",
