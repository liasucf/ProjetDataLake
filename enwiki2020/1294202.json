    "text": "Philippe Louis Henri Marie de Ch\u00e9risey, 9th marquess de Ch\u00e9risey (13 February 1923 \u2013 17 July 1985) was a French writer, radio humorist, surrealist and supporting actor (using the stage name Am\u00e9d\u00e9e). He is best known for his creation of fake parchments published in the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes by G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de, as part of his involvement in the Priory of Sion hoax between 1962-1983. ==Early life== Coming from a wealthy family in the Lorraine, de Ch\u00e9risey decided to become an actor against his family's wishes. He enrolled in the Ren\u00e9 Simon drama school in 1946 where he started his actor's training,Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, page 524 (Tome 2, Editions B\u00e9lisane: Nice, 1988) and his most notable film appearance was in Jeux interdits in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy. ==Surrealism== Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey was a follower of the surrealist movement. He claimed acquaintance with Eugene Ionesco and was like him a member of the College of Pataphysics, although - like his membership of Oulipo - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of Dagobert II. He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella Circuit (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France until 1971). ==Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau== By the early 1960s Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey met Pierre Plantard, and together they developed an interest in Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau. From the mid-1950s local hotelier No\u00ebl Corbu circulated a story to boost trade, that the 19th century priest B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile. The author Robert Charroux published Corbu's story in his 1962 book Tr\u00e9sors du Monde.Robert Charroux, Tr\u00e9sors du monde: enterr\u00e9s, emmur\u00e9s, engloutis (Paris: Fayard, 1962). In a letter dated 2 April 1965 to his girlfriend, de Ch\u00e9risey wrote: \"Don't tell anyone, but I'll be setting out again for four days in the Pyrenees with Plantard to see if we can get any closer to Mary Magdalene.\"L'ABC de RLC \u2013 l'Encyclop\u00e9die de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, pages 97-98 (Marseille: \u00c9ditions Arqa, 2009). A mixture of de Ch\u00e9risey's humor and surrealism can be identified within his activities relating to the Priory of Sion hoax, Gisors and Rennes- le-Ch\u00e2teau, contained in his correspondence as well as in his documents that he deposited in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France in Paris. ===Parchments=== During the early 1960s, de Ch\u00e9risey forged two parchments, photocopies of which appeared in the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes by G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de.G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de, L'Or de Rennes ou la Vie insolite de B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re, cur\u00e9 de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau (Paris: Ren\u00e9 Julliard, 1967). De S\u00e8de's book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion. The parchments hinted at the survival of the line of the Frankish king Dagobert II, that Plantard claimed to be descended from, as well as attempting to verify the existence of the 1000-year-old secret society, the Priory of Sion. The two parchments were later used as source material for the 1982 book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which was itself used as a primary source for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code. Other documents, containing fake genealogies, were planted in the French National Library, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Pierre Plantard and G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de fell out over book royalties when L'Or de Rennes was published in 1967, at the same time Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey announced that he had forged the parchments. De Ch\u00e9risey elaborated about this in his 1978 unpublished document L'\u00c9nigme de Rennes, claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled Sign\u00e9 Furax.Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey, L'\u00c9nigme de Rennes. Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, EL 4- Z PIECE- 110. D\u00e9p\u00f4t L\u00e9gal, 6 June 1978 A second document by de Ch\u00e9risey entitled Pierre et papier (\"Stone and Paper\") provides a more detailed explanation, giving the more complicated decoding technique to one of the parchments by using a Knight's Tour 25-letter alphabet, omitting the letter \"w\", the knowledge of which can only be known to the forger.Quoting Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey from Stone and Paper: \"my grid decipherment has only 25 letters whereas the French alphabet has 26 \u2013 I have left out W. Was I cheating? No, not at all, as I drew up Documents I and II in semi-uncial handwriting to give the impression that they dated from an historical period when the letter W was unknown to the Western world as U and V were used instead.\" Pierre Plantard published a correct Knight's Tour decoding technique in Vaincre Number 3, page 19 (September 1989), showing he held the right information. An English translation of this document, together with a reproduction of the original, was published by Jean-Luc Chaumeil in 2010.Jean-Luc Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion: Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau and the Priory of Sion (Avalonia, 2010). ===Details of the forgeries=== The text of parchment 1 was copied from Codex Bezae,Originally identified by Wieland Willker an Old Latin/Greek diglot from the 5th century CE contained in the book by Fulcran Gr\u00e9goire Vigouroux, Dictionnaire De La Bible (1895).Fulcran Vigouroux, Dictionnaire de la Bible, contenant tous les noms de personnes, de lieux, de plantes, d'animaux mentionn\u00e9s dans les Saintes \u00c9critures, les questions th\u00e9ologiques, arch\u00e9ologiques, scientifiques, critiques, relatives \u00e0 l'Ancien et au Nouveau Testament, Tome Premier 1895 (Paris: Letouzey et An\u00e9, 1895-1912) Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey's reason for copying the passage from the Codex Bezae was his interest in the phrase \"In Sabbato Secundo Primo\", also found in the Gospel of Luke 6:1. Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey stated: \"This phrase has given headaches to the anonymous (secret) societies. It has to be said that 'A day of Sabbath, second first' is not really translatable. No one has ever heard of that. So, as the disciples walk through a cornfield and, being hungry, eat the corn, there and then, it must mean 'Second Sabbath following the first day of the shewbread.' This is the only interpretation we could find.\" De Ch\u00e9risey went on to provide his own interpretation: \"In Sabbato Secundo Primo does not mean 'A day of Sabbath, second first' but rather 'As second in command, Sabassius became first.' What is interesting is that the witches' meetings are called 'Sabbaths', not because of the Jewish celebrations, but because of Sabassius, god of the Phrygians\".Jean-Luc Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion - Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau and the Priory of Sion, pages 149-150 (Avalonia, 2010) This parchment also contained an encrypted message written in modern French: \"\u00c0 Dagobert II Roi et \u00e0 Sion est ce tr\u00e9sor et il est l\u00e0 mort.\" (translated as \"To King Dagobert II and to Sion does this treasure belong, and he is there, dead\"). De Ch\u00e9risey also chose to copy material from Vigouroux because he was a priest connected with the Church of St Sulpice, a location that had been exploited as part of the Priory of Sion myths as created by Plantard and de Ch\u00e9risey, so de Ch\u00e9risey's utilisation of this priest fitted in nicely into these myths. According to an investigation into the Priory of Sion hoax by the American news program 60 Minutes, parchment 2 was copied from a 19th-century version of the Latin Vulgate published by John Wordsworth and Henry J. White Novum Testamentum Domini Nostri Iesu Christi latine secundum sancti Hieronymi (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1889\u20131954),Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood. The Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau, A Mystery Solved (Sutton Publishing Limited, Gloucestershire GL5 2BU, England, 2003.) and the original forged parchments are now in the possession of Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a French writer, who states that he had their age analyzed, and it was confirmed that they were merely decades old, not centuries. Chaumeil also has letters by de Ch\u00e9risey, which contain proof that De Ch\u00e9risey was knowingly engaging in a fraud. That Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey was not a specialist of Latin paleography and had even a bit lost his Latin knowledge (got from high school) is demonstrated in his copying of the Latin Text from the Codex Bezae for one of his parchments: for instance, he made several of the most basic errors in copying the Latin uncials, which therefore garbles the spelling of multiple words. This information is frequently omitted by those who present the parchments as being authentic. In an interview during the 1970s with author Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey asserted: \"the parchments of the Gospel according to Saint Luke fabricated by me and for which I pinched the uncial text from the work L'arch\u00e9ologie chr\u00e9tienne (Christian Archaeology) by Dom Cabrol at the National Library, section C25\".Published in Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Le Tr\u00e9sor du Triangle d'Or, page 80 (Nice: Alain Lefeuvre, 1979). Translation given in Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion, page 148 (Avalonia, 2010). Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey asserted in a letter dated 29 January 1974 to French author Pierre Jarnac: \"P.S. Do you know that the famous manuscripts supposedly discovered by the Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re were composed in 1965? And that I took responsibility for being the author?\"Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du Tr\u00e9sor de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, page 268 (L\u2019Association pour le d\u00e9veloppement de la lecture, 1985; reprinted by Editions B\u00e9lisane: Nice, 1998). According to Henry Lincoln, one of the co- authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail, Plantard admitted to him in person that the various documents had been forged, and identified de Ch\u00e9risey as their creator.Henry Lincoln, The Key To The Sacred Pattern (The Windrush Press, Moreton-in-Marsh, 1997). ===Relationship with Plantard=== A schism developed between Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey in 1983, when de Ch\u00e9risey began collaborating with Paul Rouelle (his dentist) on a book which would have incorporated the Priory of Sion concepts.Paul Rouelle, Court-circuit, avec un feu d'artifices de Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey (written in 1983). Published in 2010 with a preface by Henry Lincoln (Paris: ODS). French author Pierre Jarnac reproduced part of a letter he received dated 22 May 1985 from Pierre Plantard: \"You need to know only that I have no involvement whatsoever with the 'deathless prose' of Monsieur Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey, who was the co-author with Monsieur Paul Rouelle of the book COURT-CIRCUIT, lodged with the BN in December 1984 or January 1985, which dragged my name through the mud. The Marquis de Ch\u00e9risey was a good friend of mine from university days, but I very often disapprove of his books which are really quite bizarre.\"Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, page 550 (Tome 2, Editions B\u00e9lisane: Nice, 1988) ==Later years== Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey died in Paris on 17 July 1985, while working to finish an encyclopedia of trema.Cf. and about the first part published in 1979. His funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris and he was buried in the family vault at R\u0153ux (Pas-de-Calais).Pierre Jarnac, Les Archives de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, page 525 (Tome 2, Editions B\u00e9lisane: Nice, 1988) His death was announced by Gino Sandri in number 10 of Etudes M\u00e9rovingiennes (August 1985), the journal of the association Cercle Saint Dagobert II. ==Works== *Un mauvais quart d'heure \u00e0 passer, ou La Vengeance de la grosse molaire ( and Pierre Tchernia, 1949).
