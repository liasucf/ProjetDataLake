    "text": "1 Thessalonians 4 is the fourth chapter of the First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle, likely written in Corinth in about 50-51 CE for the church in Thessalonica. This chapter contains the exhortation about a life pleasing to God and the circumstances of Christ's second coming. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 18 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 30 (3rd century) *Codex Vaticanus (325\u2013350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330\u2013360) *Uncial 0226 (5th century; extant verses: 16\u201318) *Codex Alexandrinus (400\u2013440) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 7\u201310, 16\u201318) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) ==Keeping the traditions (4:1\u20132)== Paul wants the believers to 'walk' (Greek: ; cf. ) and to please God according to the traditions they received () from him previously (when he founded the church). ==Purity (4:3\u20138)== This section deals with the sanctification (Greek: ) of the people as the will of God. ==Brotherly love (4:9\u201312)== Paul brought up the subject of 'brotherly love' (Greek: ), which he says he doesn't need to write because the Thessalonians have been 'God-taught' (Greek: ) to love () one another. ==The circumstances of Christ's second coming (4:13\u201318)== 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:5 in Uncial 0226 from 5th century. ===Verse 16=== : For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. NKJV ===Verse 17=== : Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. NKJV * \"Then we who are alive and remain\": See Gill on 1 Thessalonians 4:15.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, \u2013 1 Thessalonians 4:15 * \"Shall be caught up\": This has a sense of happening suddenly, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible \u2013 1 Thessalonians 4:17 * \"Together with them\": that is, with \"the dead in Christ\", who will then be raised, so everyone is present at the same time, not before the other, nor the sooner with Christ than the other, but as one being raised and the other changed, they will be gathered in one company and general assembly together. * \"In the clouds\": perhaps in the same clouds when Christ will come, as a cloud received Jesus at his ascension, so at this time all the believers will ride up in the clouds of heaven. * \"To meet the Lord in the air\": while Jesus will descend, and then clear the regions of the air of Satan and his followers, because Jesus will not descend on earth yet, when it is not fit to receive him. When the earth is purged and purified by fire to become a new earth, Jesus will descend upon it, and dwell with his believers in it. Another reason why Jesus will stay in the air, and his believers will meet him there, is that he will take them up with him into the third heaven and preserve them there until the burning of the world is over, and then all the elect of God will descend from heaven as a bride adorned for her husband, and he with them, also when the tabernacle of God will be with men (). ==See also== * Jesus Christ * Macedonia *Rapture * Second Coming * Related Bible parts: Matthew 24, Matthew 25, John 14, Revelation 2 ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 04 ",
