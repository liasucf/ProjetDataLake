    "text": "\u015awidger (died 1156) was a semi-legendary bishop of Kruszwice. The chronicle of Jan D\u0142ugosz indicates that he was a bishop in Kruszwice in 1129-1156. He was buried in the Kruszwick cathedral.Fr. Dr Jan Fija\u0142ek: Ustalenie chronologii biskup\u00f3w w\u0142oc\u0142awskich [English: Establishing the chronology of W\u0142oc\u0142awek bishops], (Krak\u00f3w 1894).Karol Maleczy\u0144ski, Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty, (Cracow, 2010).Magdalena Binia\u015b-Szkopek: Boles\u0142aw IV K\u0119dzierzawy - prince of Mazovia and princeps, (Pozna\u0144 2009). Swidger or Swidgerus is the first historical bishop of Kujawy. He was probably a German from the Norbertine Order. The only certain reference to his subject is the entry in the obituary of the Benedictine monastery of St. Micha\u0142 in Bamberg, which may indicate his connection with the mission of Otto of Bamberg. Jan D\u0142ugosz in his chronicle ascribes to him the consecration of the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno on March 16, 1133, but there is no consensus on the reliability of this entry.Counter-mindedness of Dlugosz's relationship, at least as to the annual date, was offered by Jan \u0141ukowski: Contribution to the explanation of the original history of the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno, Annals of the Society of Friends of Pozna\u0144 Studies vol.23, 1896, p. 22 and seq. and Maleczy\u0144ski, pp. 332 and 357. In any case, in the bull of Innocent II from June 4, 1133, is the first reference of the diocese of Kujawy, which allows us to assume that Swidger was actually a bishop of this diocese this year. The exact date of Swidger's death is unknown. The Bamberg obituary only gives March 10 without an annual date. His successor Warner is certified for the first time on April 4, 1148, in the protection bullave of Eugene III. ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:12th-century births Category:1159 deaths Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:12th-century Polish people ",
