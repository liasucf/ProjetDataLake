    "text": "Palace of Youth and Sports (; ; formerly named \"Boro and Ramiz\") is a multi- purpose hall located in Pristina, Kosovo. It includes two arenas, the larger of which has a capacity of 8,000 spectators, and the smaller a capacity of 3,000 spectators. It also includes a shopping mall, indoor parking, two convention halls and a library. The building in its entirety measures over 10,000 square meters. ==History== In 1975, a referendum was held, and citizens of Pristina, then capital of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, voted in favor of building a large hall. The complex was finished in 1977. It was originally named \"Boro and Ramiz\" (, ), after two World War II Yugoslav Partisans and People's heroes of Yugoslavia, Boro Vukmirovi\u0107 and Ramiz Sadiku. Vukmirovi\u0107 was a Serb, while Sadiku was an Albanian, therefore named so to symbolize brotherhood and unity between Serbs and Albanians. The building was heavily damaged in a fire on 25 February 2000. It was partially renovated, but the larger arena and the convention hall are still out of use. The ownership of the building is disputed between the Municipality of Pristina and the Kosovo Privatization Agency. ==Building== The smaller arena is mostly used for basketball by KB Prishtina. In April 2014, it hosted the Final Four of the Balkan Basketball League.Official: Pristina organizes 'Final Four' of the Balkan League - Online News | Lajme Online The arena is also used for futsal, handball, athletics, basketball, volleyball, numerous other sporting competitions, various concerts, exhibitions, fairs, conventions, and congresses.
