    "text": "Sir Harold Bernard St. John, KA (16 August 1931 \u2013 29 February 2004) was a Barbadian politician who served as the third Prime Minister of Barbados from 1985 to 1986. He was leader of the Barbados Labour Party from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1985 to 1987. He was widely known as Bree. St. John was born in the Parish of Christ Church and attended the Christ Church Foundation School. He was professionally trained as a lawyer at the University College London. In 1959, before the island became independent from the United Kingdom, St. John joined the Barbados Labour Party, and after independence in 1966, he was elected to the Barbados House of Assembly. He served as a member of the Upper Chamber between 1971 and 1976 as a member of the Opposition party. St. John left the Upper House when he was re-elected to the House of Assembly in 1976, when his party under J.M.G. Adams won the election. He served in numerous cabinet positions in the 1970s including deputy prime minister, minister of trade and industry, and minister of tourism where he did his most influential work in developing the tourism industry in Barbados. When Adams died in 1985, St. John became Prime Minister. The following year he was defeated in the elections by Errol Barrow and the Democratic Labour Party. In 1994 when the BLP regained power, he did not return to the Cabinet and served instead as a backbencher under Owen Arthur. That same year St. John was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados. In 2004, Bernard St. John died of cancer in Bridgetown. He left his widow Lady Stella (n\u00e9e Hope) and three children: Bryte, Charmaine and Nicole. ==See also== * Politics of Barbados * List of Premiers/Prime Ministers of Barbados == References == ==External links== * Category:1931 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Members of the Senate of Barbados Category:Leaders of the Barbados Labour Party Category:Prime Ministers of Barbados Category:People educated at Harrison College (Barbados) Category:Deaths from cancer in Barbados Category:People from Christ Church, Barbados Category:Members of the House of Assembly of Barbados Category:Knights and Dames of St Andrew (Barbados) ",
