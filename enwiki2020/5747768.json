    "text": "Metrovalencia is a modern amalgamation of former FEVE narrow gauge diesel and electric operated suburban/regional railways. It is a large suburban network that crosses the city of Valencia, with all trains continuing out to the suburbs. It also has destinations on lines that make it more closely resemble commuter trains. The unique system combines light railway, metro and several tram operations north of the T\u00faria riverbed park with line 4. Trains of lines 1, 3, 5 and 9 have automatic train operation (ATO) in 25.3 kilometers of underground system. Tram lines 4, 6 and 8 are operated by modern trams. This network consists of more than of route, of which is underground. The system authority Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana (FGV) uses bilingual signage in Valencian and Spanish. == Operations == === Lines === {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" |- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" !align=\"center\"|Line !align=\"center\"|Terminals !align=\"center\"|Year openedValencia metro at urbanrail.net, accessed 5 July 2015 !align=\"center\"|Service type !align=\"center\"|Length !align=\"center\"|Stations !align=\"center\"|Passengers in 2018 |- |link=Line 1 (Metrovalencia) |align=\"left\"|B\u00e9tera \u2013 Villanueva de Castell\u00f3n |align=\"center\"|1988 |align=\"center\"|Underground + Regional train |align=\"right\"| |align=\"center\"|40 |align=\"right\"|9,808,295 |- |link=Line 2 (Metrovalencia) |align=\"left\"|Ll\u00edria \u2013 Torrent Avinguda |align=\"center\"|1988 |align=\"center\"|Underground + Regional train |align=\"right\"| |align=\"center\"|33 |align=\"right\"|9,124,791 |- |30px |align=\"left\"|Rafelbunyol \u2013 Aeroport |align=\"center\"|1995 |align=\"center\"|Underground + Regional train |align=\"right\"| |align=\"center\"|27 |align=\"right\"|14,147,324 |- |30px |align=\"left\"|Mas del Rosari/Ll.

Lines 7 to 9 were created in 2015 by splitting existing branch lines, with the only new stations for these lines consisting of the extension from Manises to Riba-roja de T\u00faria. The network includes five unmanned stations: Rocafort, Fuente del Jarro, Massarojos, Benaguasil 1 and Font de l\u00b4Almaguer.FGV prev\u00e9 el cierre de l\u00edneas y la venta de estaciones para ahorrar 29,3 millones (in Spanish), Levante, 3 January 2013. === Technical data === * Gauge width: (narrow gauge) * Current system: 750 V DC / 1500 V DC, overhead wire === Passenger numbers === In 2012, an estimated 63,103,814 passengers used the service, a decline of 2.8% from the 65,074,726 who had used it in 2011. The 2011 figures had shown a 5% decline compared to 2010. On average 172,887 passengers a day used the service in 2012 with the busiest day being 18 March, the final day of the Fallas festival, when 482,960 passengers used the service. The three most used stations on the network were all in the centre of Valencia: X\u00e0tiva, beside Valencia's main train station, with 4,769,628 passengers in 2012, Col\u00f3n, in one of Valencia's main shopping streets, with 4,189,736 passengers and \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0, an interchange station for lines 1,4 and 5 situated beside Valencia old town, with 2,461,012 users. The fourth and fifth busiest stations were T\u00faria, next to Valencia's main bus station, with 2,035,521 and Facultats, serving the University of Valencia, with 1,951,080 users. The remaining stations in the top eight were Pla\u00e7a de Espanya (1,807,538 passengers), Amistat (1,552,281) and Mislata (1,505,106). The first two of these were located in areas near Valencia centre, while Mislata was the main station for the satellite town of the same name.Metrovalencia desplaz\u00f3 63'1 millones de pasajeros en 2012, un 3% menos (in Spanish), ABC, 6 January 2013. In 2014, the system carried 60,111,000 passengers. In 2015, 60,686,589 passengers used the network, reversing a decline which had occurred in previous years. Seventeen stations reported more than 1 million users in that year.Metrovalencia alcanza los 60,6 millones de viajeros en 2015 y supera los conseguidos el a\u00f1o anterior, 20minutos.es, 23 January 2016, accessed 19 May 2016 In 2019, patronage reached an all-time high of over 69 million. The ten busiest stations were X\u00e0tiva with 5,459,784 passengers, Col\u00f3n (4,520,931); \u00c0ngel Guimer\u00e0 (3,067,957); T\u00faria (2,044,393); Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya (2,035,060); Facultats (1,951,546); Benimaclet (1,837,812); Amistat-Casa de Salud (1,817,120); Mislata (1,708,658); Avinguda del Cid (1,598,112). == History == The Metrovalencia network traces its origins to the Trenet de Val\u00e8ncia (ca; es) system of narrow-gauge interurban railways, of which its first section, built by the Valencian Tramway Society (:es:Sociedad Valenciana de Tranv\u00edas) was opened in 1888 between Valencia (near the Pont de Fusta, or Fusta Bridge) and Ll\u00edria. Several further extensions of the Trenet were later built between 1891 and 1912. In 1917, both the Valencian Tramway Corporation and the Compagnie G\u00e9nerale des Tramways de Valence (Espagne) Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lyonnaise (es) were merged into a single company called the Valencia Tram and Rail Company (:es:Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas y Ferrocarriles de Valencia), which operated until 1964 where after years of losses, the rail operations of CTFV was acquired by FEVE. === First four lines === Lines 1 and 5 at Torrent Avinguda Station. Differences between the old line (1) and the new line (5) can be seen in this picture On 8 October 1988 the tunnel through which line 1 crosses Valencia was opened between Sant Isidre and Ademuz (now Empalme), which connected the line with southbound trains from Val\u00e8ncia-Jes\u00fas to Castell\u00f3 de la Ribera (now Villanueva de Castell\u00f3n) at Sant Isidre. Line 2 went from Val\u00e8ncia-Sud to Ll\u00edria, with some trains terminating in Paterna. In May 1994 the tranvia line 4 opened. Valencia was the first city in Spain to use this mode of transport in the modern era. Originally, line 4 was long and had 21 stations. The line connected the suburban lines with high demand zones such as the Polytechnic University, the new university campus and the Malvarosa beach, which the former line Empalme - Pont de Fusta - El Grau had connected before. One year later, in May 1995, line 3 was extended from El Palmaret in Alboraria to Alameda. The extension reused the older railway line Pont de Fusta-Rafelbunyol, of which part was scrapped (between Pont de Fusta - Sant Lloren\u00e7 - El Palmaret), and the rest was switched from 750 V to 1500 V. Further alterations followed five years later. On 16 September 1998, line 2 was merged with line 1, and Line 3 was extended from Alameda to Avinguda del Cid in the west and Torrent in the south with some trains only going as far as Jes\u00fas. Half a year later, on 20 May 1999, line 3 was extended from Avinguda del Cid to Mislata-Almassil. === Lines 5 and 6, and more extensions === Many stations have an artistic exhibit in the entrance hall. This one is in Benimaclet. In April 2003, the new line 5 was opened. This line took over the previous line 3 connection from Alameda to Torrent, together with a newly constructed branch from Alameda to Ayora . (Although some very early morning trains still travel from Machado to Torrent, this is not represented on maps.) One year later, the new line 5 was extended, together with line 1, from Torrent to Torrent Avinguda, a distance of . On 3 October 2005, Bail\u00e9n station was opened on line 5. This station is between Col\u00f3n and Jes\u00fas, and has connections with Val\u00e8ncia-Nord, the main railway station of Val\u00e8ncia. Furthermore, Bailen is close to the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya station on line 1. In October 2005, line 4 was extended to Mas del Rosari, and on 20 December 2005 to Lloma Llarga-Terramelar. On 2 April 2007, Line 5 was extended to the East to a new station Mar\u00edtim-Serrer\u00eda (originally planned as Jer\u00f3nimo Monsoriu). On 18 April 2007, Line 5 extended to the airport (Aeroport Station) in the west and to the Port (Marina Real Juan Carlos 1 Station, originally called Nept\u00fa station) in the east, this last section from Mar\u00edtim-Serreria to Marina Real Juan Carlos 1 is a tram section; the trains go from Aeroport to Mar\u00edtim- Serrreria and then a tram operates between Mar\u00edtim-Serreria and Marina Real Juan Carlos 1; the tram is now denoted as Line 8. Line 3 was extended to the Airport as well to cover the schedule limitations of line 5 to Aeroport station. On 22 September 2007, Line 6 was opened, linking the neighbourhoods of Orriols and Torrefiel to the metro system for the first time. Additionally a new station \"Torre del Virrei\" was added to Line 1. It is situated between the stations of \"L'Eliana\" and \"La Pobla de Vallbona\". On 12 December 2010, the two overground stations on Lines 3 and 9 in the municipality of Alboraya, Alboraya and Palmaret, were replaced by the subterranean stations of Alboraya - Peris Arag\u00f3 and Alboraya - Palmaret. On Line 1, the station of Jesus was renamed Joaquin Sorolla, while the Hospital station was renamed Safranar. On 6 March 2015, a 4-station extension to Riba-roja de T\u00faria was opened. This followed the path of a regional train line, which had been closed in 2005.La l\u00ednea de metro a Ribarroja entrar\u00e1 en servicio el 6 de marzo (in Spanish), Las Provincias, 2 March 2015. In April 2015, the metro map was redrawn, with several of the branches split into separate lines, increasing the number of lines to 9.As\u00ed ser\u00e1n las nuevas l\u00edneas de Metrovalencia (in Spanish), ABC, 27 November 2014. === Accidents === Accident occurred on 9 September 2005 Between 2002 and the first quarter of 2012, 83 accidents had occurred on the network, costing the lives of 56 people.La red de Metrovalencia ha sufrido 83 accidentes con 56 fallecidos desde 2002 (in Spanish), El Pais, 5 June 2013. On 9 September 2005, two trains crashed into each other on Line 1. Nobody was killed, but according to early reports 35 people were injured, 4 of whom were taken to hospital, their condition described as serious. The first train had been stationary waiting for a red signal. The second used its emergency brakes to avoid a collision, but was hit by a third train. The force of the impact severely damaged the drivers' cabs at the front of the last train and at the rear of the second train. The crash occurred between Paiporta and Picanya about 5 km south-east of the city centre. The 3729 and 3730 EMUs are now a single EMU with 3729A and the 3730A cars, the 'B' cars were severely damaged and are currently at Val\u00e8ncia-Sud workshop, waiting to be scrapped. The date 3 July 2006 was a dark day for the Valencia metro. In a severe accident, a two- car EMU derailed between Jes\u00fas and Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya stations. At least 43 people were killed and 47 injured. It was the worst metro accident in Spanish history. == Future service == Metrovalencia map with proposed expansions Three more lines are planned to be opened in upcoming years. The Tavernes Blanques - Natzaret metro line is under construction and partially completed, work was halted in 2011 due to the Spanish economic crisis and resumed in 2017. {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" !align=\"center\"|Terminals !align=\"center\"|Service type !align=\"center\"|Comments |- bgcolor=\"#FFFFE0\" |align=\"left\"|Tavernes Blanques (South) - Natzaret |align=\"center\"|Underground + tramway |align=\"center\"|Under construction.
