    "text": "Margaret E. Collinson is a paleobotanist at Royal Holloway, University of London, United Kingdom. ==Career== Her career has led her to leadership of the Plant Paleobiology Research Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, UK. Her research interests are interdisciplinary and wide-ranging within plant Paleobotany as evidenced by her publications. They particularly include consideration of geochemical signatures of oxygen, biomolecules and other elements; the paleoclimate and floral assemblages; pollen and other tissues; and evolution in ancient plants. She has been president of the International Organization of Paleobotany, a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (2007), and a corresponding Member of the Senckenberg Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Naturforschung (Germany). In 2015 she was awarded Distinguished Fellow of the Botanical Society of America. ==Selected publications== She is the author or co-author of over 180 scientific publications. Among her most significant publications are: * Gordon N. Inglis, Margaret Collinson et al., (2017) Mid-latitude continental temperatures through the early Eocene in western Europe.
