    "text": "A postal strike controversy in Finland refers to a series of events in late 2019 in Finland, where widespread trade union protests which later resulted in the resignation of PM Rinne and the dissolution of his cabinet. In November 2019, Prime minister Antti Rinne and local government minister Sirpa Paatero were accused of giving misinformation, specifically about the transfer of work-contracts of 700 posti (Finland's state owned postal service) package handlers, which would result in lower pay. The strike led to a one-day sympathy strike by Finland's transport sector, which had to cancel 300 flights. Gradually it transformed into a trade-union solidarity protest in the country. It ultimately led to the resignation of prime minister Rinne, when the Centre Party withdrew its support from the current government. ==Background== Labor unions in Finland have been traditionally strong, but they have been angered by the competivity pact, which increased working hours three days a year without pay rise between 2016 and 2019. The deal was negotiated in 2019, to help Finland recover from recession. The center-left government, elected in 2019, was considered more favorable to employee concerns. However, a decision by PM Rinne to shift 700 posti workers from packaging and e-commerce into a collective bargaining unit prompted widespread protests from postal workers. ==The strike== In response, the postal and logistics union went into strike on November 11. 14 days later, solidarity protests from union in other industries shut the nation down. Despite disruption in daily lives, 60 percent of Finns supported the move. Two days later, the postal workers reached an agreement with the government. Both parties settled that the 700 workers will return to the previous collective employee-employer agreement, and workers will return to their work. ==Aftermath== In wake of the crisis, the Center party said that it had lost confidence in Rinne, and Rinne handed over his resignation to president Sauli Niinisto. Sanna Marin, a Social democratic party member, was appointed prime minister following his resignation. ==References== Category:2019 in Finland Category:Postal strikes Category:Controversies in Europe Category:2019 controversies Category:2019 protests ",
