The Globe and Mail, September 22, 1978. The film was dismissed by The Globe and Mail film critic Jay Scott as being \"in the respected tradition of naturalistic, manic-depressive Canadian cinema\", and as \"less valuable for what it is than for what it indicates that the people involved with it might be able to do under other, more agreeable circumstances.\" Other critics were more charitable, with both Bruce Kirkland of the Toronto Star\"Three of a kind\". Toronto Star, September 17, 1978. and Ian Haysom of the Ottawa Journal\"Ladies and gentlemen, the winner is...\" Ottawa Journal, September 21, 1978. calling it a good but not perfect film. Rose and Gabourie subsequently collaborated on the 1979 film Title Shot, which was more poorly received than Three Card Monte.Jay Scott, \"Title Shot misses both of its targets\".
