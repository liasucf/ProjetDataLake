    "text": "The 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament was a single-elimination tournament of 68 teams to determine the men's National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college basketball national champion for the 2018\u201319 season. The 81st annual edition of the tournament began on March 19, 2019, and concluded with the championship game on April 8 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Virginia Cavaliers, with Virginia winning 85\u201377 in overtime. Two schools made their first appearances in the tournament: Big South champion Gardner\u2013Webb and Southland champion Abilene Christian. For the first time since 2001, no #8 seed survived the first round of the tournament. This was also the first time since the First Four was established in 2011 that no team in the First Four advanced past the first round of the tournament. This tournament marked the first time that the Auburn Tigers of the Southeastern Conference and the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Big 12 Conference made the Final Four. This also marked the third Final Four appearance for the Virginia Cavaliers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, but their first since 1984. The 2019 tournament was the first since 1979 to see two first-time finalists, and the first since 2006 to have a first-time national champion. Carsen Edwards of Purdue was the leading scorer, with 139 points in only 4 games\u2013producing a stellar average of 34.8 points per game. Edwards also set the record for most made 3-point shots in a tournament, with 28. The previous record holder, Glen Rice of Michigan in 1989, made 27, but did it in 6 games. In the previous year's tournament, Virginia had infamously become the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed. At the conclusion of this year's title game, CBS announcer Jim Nantz dubbed Virginia's win the \"all-time turnaround title.\" ==Tournament procedure== A total of 68 teams entered the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest- seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament. The Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68. The selections and seedings were completed and revealed on Sunday, March 17. ==2019 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues== The following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2019 tournament: First Four *March 19 and 20 **University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton) First and Second Rounds *March 21 and 23 ** XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut (Host: University of Connecticut) ** Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake University) ** VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, Jacksonville, Florida (Host: Jacksonville University) ** Vivint Smart Home Arena, Salt Lake City, Utah (Host: University of Utah) *March 22 and 24 ** Colonial Life Arena, Columbia, South Carolina (Host: University of South Carolina) ** Nationwide Arena, Columbus, Ohio (Host: Ohio State University) ** BOK Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma (Host: University of Tulsa) ** SAP Center, San Jose, California (Host: West Coast Conference) Regional Semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) *March 28 and 30 **West Regional, Honda Center, Anaheim, California (Host: Big West Conference) **South Regional, KFC Yum!

The tournament returned to Hartford's XL Center for the first time since 1998. For the first time since 1970, the tournament returned to Columbia, South Carolina, with games played at the Colonial Life Arena. ==Qualification and selection== Four teams, out of 353 in Division I,

As part of a cycle than began in 2016, CBS televised the 2019 Final Four and championship game. In response to criticism over TBS's handling of the selection show in 2018 (which featured an unconventional two-hour format where all the qualifying teams were first revealed in alphabetical order before the matchups were actually unveiled, and had viewership fall by 52% partly due to it also being aired on cable rather than CBS), it was announced that CBS's selection show would revert to an hour-long format, and prioritize unveiling the bracket. CNN president Jeff Zucker, who had also become head of WarnerMedia's sports properties after a reorganization, explained that \"it's a sign of understanding when things don't necessarily go as well as you would hope you change it. So there's no shame in that.
