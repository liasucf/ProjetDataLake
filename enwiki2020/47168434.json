    "text": "Kingdom Days in an Evil Age is the third album from the Christian metalcore band, Sleeping Giant. ==Critical reception== Zachary Zinn writes: \"Sleeping Giant does a tremendous job at keeping the songs diversified and making each one sound different and unique. It\u2019s great to see a heavy band focus more on the Maker than breakdowns and growls. It\u2019s a rare gem that comes highly recommended to fans of the genre.\" Jeremiah Holdsworthfrom Indie Vision Music says: \"Musically this album is kicking on all cylinders. If you were a fan of Sleeping Giant before, then you will definitely be impressed with this release. If you weren\u2019t a fan then I definitely recommend checking this one out, because this isn\u2019t the same Sleeping Giant from the past. I also recommend getting the deluxe edition, because the three bonus tracks, are just as good, if not better, then most of the songs on the regular album.\" ==Track listing== ==Credits== * J.R.
