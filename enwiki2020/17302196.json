The cards were identical to the 1977 Topps regular issue cards and were distributed as part of a promotion at the company's outlets in the region. Some of the players had a different photo than their Topps counterpart. This Burger King set originally had 22 cards plus a checklist card, but a Lou Piniella card was added after the promotion began along with a revised checklist. Only the checklist card featured any Burger King branding. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |Burger King Yankees | |24 |2.5 x 3.5 inches |} ====Canada==== Since 1965, the Canadian candy company O-Pee-Chee produced virtually identical, but smaller, sets identical to the Topps issue of the same year.
