    "text": "The Walt Disney Company is developing an attraction to be based on the 1964 film Mary Poppins in the United Kingdom Pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The ride will be a part of a Cherry Tree Lane expansion, inviting guests of Epcot into the magical world created by P.L. Travers in her Mary Poppins book series. The ride was announced at the 2019 D23 Expo. On July 15, 2020, when EPCOT officially reopened, both \"Spaceship Earth: Our Shared Story\" as well as the Mary Poppins attraction's sequences were removed from the EPCOT Experience. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Disney said, \"As with most businesses during this period, we are further evaluating long-term project plans. The decision was made to postpone development of the 'Mary Poppins'-inspired attraction and Spaceship Earth at this time.\" ==References== Category:Epcot Category:World Showcase Category:Amusement rides based on film franchises ",
