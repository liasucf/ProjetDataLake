    "text": "The New Salem Covered Bridge, near Commerce, Georgia, is a multiple kingpost truss covered bridge built in 1915. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It spans a branch of Grove Creek, and is located north of Commerce on SR S992. By 1974 it had been bypassed by a modern concrete bridge, so it is no longer used. It is a long single span bridge.
