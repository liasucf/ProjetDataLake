In 2005, Jeff Sharlet claimed that while New Life is \"by no means the largest megachurch ... [it] holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism\" than any other church in America. == History == New Life Church was founded in 1984 by Ted Haggard. The church started under his leadership as an independent church meeting in his home. From these origins, the church grew through a succession of larger meeting spaces including strip mall office space and other non-traditional church locations. ===Ted Haggard scandals and resignation=== The south entrance and worship center On November 2, 2006, Haggard was accused of paying a male escort for sex for three years and of also using methamphetamine. Later the same day, Haggard voluntarily stepped down as pastor so \"the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity\", and that he would be seeking \"spiritual advice and guidance\". Two days later, New Life Church's Board of Overseers announced that they had decided to permanently dismiss Haggard from his role. In January 2009, new allegations emerged that Haggard, while pastor at New Life, had an inappropriate relationship with a former attendee. Haggard's successor, Brady Boyd, said the church reached a six figure settlement with the man, who was in his early 20s at the time. According to a News Channel 13 report, the man said the contact was \"not consensual\". ===Shooting=== On December 9, 2007, Matthew Murray, age 24, opened fire in the New Life Church, striking five people and killing two, sisters Rachel and Stephanie Works; their father David Works was one of the individuals injured. Jeanne Assam, a church security volunteer, shot and wounded the gunman who then killed himself. Several hours prior, the same gunman opened fire at a Youth With A Mission training center in Arvada, Colorado, striking four people and killing two. He was formerly a missionary-in-training with Youth With A Mission and was from a devout Christian family. Police found a letter from the shooter addressed \"To God\". ==In popular culture== Ted Haggard and other members of the church were featured on a 1997 episode of the PRI radio program This American Life, as well as the documentaries Jesus Camp, Friends of God, Constantine's Sword, The Root of All Evil?, and HBO's The Trials of Ted Haggard. ==References== ==External links== * * Max Blumenthal, The Nightmare of Christianity The Nation (September 9, 2009) Category:1984 establishments in Colorado Category:Evangelical churches in Colorado Category:Evangelical megachurches in the United States Category:Religion in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:Christian organizations established in 1984 ",
