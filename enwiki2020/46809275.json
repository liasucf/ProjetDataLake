    "text": "Mai-Dun is an orchestral work composed in 1921 by John Ireland (18791962). He called it a symphonic rhapsody; another description might be tone poem. In 1931, he arranged it for piano four hands. In British Celtic, \"Mai-dun\" means \"great hill\". Ireland's piece is a musical evocation of a notable iron age fort: Maiden Castle, Dorset, nearby the house of the English novelist and poet Thomas Hardy (18401928) whose name for the place Ireland adopted. It has been said that, \"ancient sites with echoes of the supernatural, including the Channel Islands, inform some of Ireland\u2019s few orchestral pieces\"; and of Mai- Dun itself that, \"it is a strong piece, aggressive at times, resourcefully scored, and Ireland\u2019s imagination was ignited by the largest hill-fort in England, dating from 3000BC, and its violent history.\" A typical performance takes about 12\u00bd minutes. == References == Category:1921 compositions Category:1931 compositions Category:Symphonic poems by John Ireland Ireland, John Category:Compositions for piano four-hands ",
