The Turkish traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi mentions the castle: \"The Khust castle is located at the top of Mount Hassan. Its walls are high and thick, and with its power it is similar to the Iskander fortress, because its height already reaches the sky. Residential buildings facing east face one above the other. The roofs of the palaces are covered with colored tiles, the roofs of the churches - iron, the crosses on them - of pure gold and so shine that the one who looks at them gets tired eyes and is forced, with respect for them, to lower their gaze.\"http://www.ji.lviv.ua/n44texts/fedaka7.htm After the defeat of the Hungarian army in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, The Kingdom of Hungary fell apart and the castle in Khust became a part of the Principality of Transylvania. ==History== On the outskirts of the city of Khust rises a mountain of volcanic origin, on which in the 11\u201312th centuries. a castle-fortress was built.
