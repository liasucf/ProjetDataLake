The peak of Freeman's career occurred during his first tenure with the Green Bay Packers including a victory in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997 over the New England Patriots.

Untouched by the defender, Freeman jumped to his feet and ran the ball in for the winning touchdown over the Vikings, the Packers' rival. The touchdown prompted ABC play-by-play announcer Al Michaels, who was obviously stunned by the play, to famously shout, \"He did WHAT?!\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lQmyLLxRNcA In 2005, ESPN labeled the catch as the greatest play in the history of Monday Night Football. Freeman has said it was the second best catch of his career (claiming his best to be an 81-yard touchdown reception in Super Bowl XXXI).
