In 2019, the team was invited to play in the third leg of the 2018\u201319 Curling World Cup, where they finished with a 2-4 record. Two weeks later, the team won the 2019 Scottish championship, https://competitions.scottishcurling.org/competitions/scottish-curling- championship-2/ defeating perennial winners Eve Muirhead in the final. Team Jackson had committed to play in the 2019 Winter Universiade (which ended just before the World Championships), so Scottish Curling initially wanted to send Muirhead to the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship as Scotland's representative. However, Team Jackson asked for a review of the rules, which stated the winner of the Scottish championship gets to represent the country at the World Championships. The review was successful, and Team Jackson went on to represent Scotland at the 2019 Worlds.https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter- sports/47285010 They also played in the Universiade, where they finished fourth. At the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship, Team Jackson finished in 10th place with a 4-8 record. ==Personal life== She attended Edinburgh Napier Universityhttp://www.winningstudents- scotland.ac.uk/athletes/2017-18/curling/name-168107-en.html where she studied Business and Enterprise in Sport.https://www.bucs.org.uk/page.asp?section=20827&sectionTitle;=Sophie+Sinclair ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1997 births Category:Scottish female curlers Category:Alumni of Edinburgh Napier University Category:Competitors at the 2019 Winter Universiade ",
