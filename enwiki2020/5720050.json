    "text": "Lymphangitis carcinomatosa is inflammation of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis) caused by a malignancy. Breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, and prostate cancers are the most common tumors that result in lymphangitis. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa was first described by pathologist Gabriel Andral in 1829 in a patient with uterine cancer. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa may show the presence of Kerley B lines on chest X-ray. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa most often affects people 40\u201349 years of age. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa may be caused by the following malignancies as suggested by the mnemonic: \"Certain Cancers Spread By Plugging The Lymphatics\" (cervical cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer, breast cancer/bronchiogenic carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, laryngeal cancer) ==Pathology== In most cases, lymphangitis carcinomatosis is caused by the dissemination of a tumor with its cells along the lymphatics. However, in about 20 percent of cases, the inflammation of the lymphatic tubules (lymphangitis) is caused by a tumor that blocks the drainage of the lymph duct. In the lung, this is often caused by a centrally located mass, near the hilum of the lung that blocks lymphatic drainage. ==Prognosis== Previously, the finding of lymphangitis carcinomatosis meant about a six-month life expectancy. However, improved treatment has improved survival in patients with lymphangitis carcinomatosis, with patients often surviving three or more years with treatment. ==History== Lymphangitis carcinomatosa was first described by pathologist Gabriel Andral in 1829 in a patient with uterine cancer. ==See also== * Lymphangitis ==References== == External links == Category:Paraneoplastic syndromes Category:Medical mnemonics ",
