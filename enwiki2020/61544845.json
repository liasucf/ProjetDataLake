    "text": "NGC 1317 (also known as NGC 1318) is barred spiral galaxy in constellation Fornax, in Fornax cluster. It was discovered by Julius Schmidt on January 19, 1865. It appears to be interacting with much larger NGC 1316, but uncertanity of distance and scales of tidal distortions make this uncertain. It is a member of NGC 1316 subgroup, part of Fornax Cluster. Its size is 2.8' x 2.4' which with average distance gives diameter of 55,000 light-years. == Distance estimates == HST NGC 1317 has uncertain distance. Based on redshift distance is 55.1 million light-years, but it isn't on NED base and some other methods estimate distance as large as 88.4 million light-years. Distance of this galaxy is somewhere between 55 and 88 Mly, but true distance is unknown.https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi- bin/objsearch?objname=NGC+1317&extend;=no&hconst;=73&omegam;=0.27&omegav;=0.73&corr;_z=1&out;_csys=Equatorial&out;_equinox=J2000.0&obj;_sort=RA+or+Longitude&of;=pre_text&zv;_breaker=30000.0&list;_limit=5&img;_stamp=YES Average distance between two estimates is around 70 million light-years, which means NGC 1317 is also in Fornax Cluster. == References == == External links == * Category:Fornax Cluster 1317 Category:Fornax (constellation) Category:Barred spiral galaxies ",
