Sara, desperate to know the truth, blames Lucille as the culprit, but Barbara insists that her daughter is not mentally sane. Kara, on the other hand, is also now beginning to suspect Sara as Isabella's kidnapper. Laura attempts to get Kara to drop the charges against Sara but Kara is desperate to receive justice. Laura and Itoy then decide to conduct their own investigation by following Alex to the mall. The two see Alex exchanging items with a man whom the deem as suspicious.

As a consequence of this, Sebastian, too, starts to become suspicious of Alex. Full of anger, Alex leaves the Suarez household. Barbara then meets up with Laura, revealing to her that Lucille's former nurse is returning from abroad. Alex then uses Hannah as spy to know all of the movements of Suarez family. Hannah then tells Alex that Laura and Barbara were talking about Lucille's nurse. Alex then concocts a plan to further implicate Sara in Rebecca's disappearance. Julio then orders his men to kidnap Flor Bautista (uncredited), Lucille's nurse, and to bribe her to tell Barbara that Sara ordered her to give the baby pin to Lucille. With Alex's plan in motion, Flor tells Barbara that Sara was the one who ordered her to give Isabella's pin to Lucille. Barbara reveals to Kara and Laura about her finding, however, they refuse to believe her. Kara and Laura then decide to meet up with Flor, who they later convince to testify in the trial against Sara. With her conscience getting the best of her, Flor decides to retract her agreement with Alex. Desperate to incriminate Sara, Alex orders her men to kidnap and hold Flor's children captive. The day of the court day arrives, Flor decides not to disclose the truth. Flor then tells the court that Sara was the one who ordered her to give the pin to Lucille. The court then brings out Dante Nicholas (uncredited), Dina's (Cristine Yao) brother, who was hired along with Flor. Dante then discloses to the court that Sara was the mastermind behind Isabella's kidnapping. Shortly after the hearing, Alex and Sara have a heated confrontation in the restroom. Sara then vows to clear her name and to make Isabella's real kidnapper pay. Sara's sentencing day soon arrives. But because of the testimonies and evidences, Sara is found guilty is Isabella's kidnapping and is sentenced to reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment). Because they believe that Sara is innocent, Barbara orders her henchman, Diego (uncredited), to investigate Julio and Alex and tell her and Laura the findings. With the initial investigation of Barbara and Laura, all of the evidences point to Alex, whom they believe is the culprit. Meanwhile, Sara, who now resides in prison, becomes her fellow inmates protector and defender from the powerful Rona \"Mayora\" (Maria Isabel Lopez). Desperate to talk to Rebecca, Sara decides to swallow her pride and become Mayora's servant in order to use a cellphone that was illegally smuggled in the prison. While in the prison, Sara befriends Kengkay (Kristel Fulgar), Nancy (Sunshine Garcia), and Lola Caring (Odette Khan). Later, Sara soon befriends Mayora, after learning that she, too, has a child that she wants to make amends with. Sara, along with Kengkay, Lola Caring, Nancy, and Mayora, plan to escape the prison. Sara puts their plan into motion by starting a fire, Rona pretends to be injured in order to distract a guard so that Kengkay could steal the key, and Nancy tampers with the circuit breaker in order for power to be shut down throughout the prison. Sara, along with her friends, escape with the help of Banjo, who brings them to a hideout location in the woods. Sara then decides to proceed with her agenda in proving Alex guilty, follows her, and subsequently gets into a major brawl with Alex. Sara then flees; Alex later calls Sebastian, further attempting to incriminate Sara. Because of this, Kara begins to worry about their safety, fearing that Sara might target her family next. Sara then tries to investigate a man named Mr. Gomez (uncredited), who happens to be a customer of Julio's illegal business. Sara also finds out that Mr. Gomez knows Alex and Dina's connection with one another. Sara and Banjo then decide to follow Mr. Gomez but, unfortunately, cannot follow him. Sara then believes she has enough evidence to implicate Alex, and calls Kara and arranges to meet with her. Sebastian and Kara then start to wonder if Sara is innocent. Unbeknownst to them, Hannah overheard the conversation, and later reported this to Alex. Later, Patricia then discovers Julio's gun that she used to kill Barbara's investigator, Diego. Sara and the fellow inmates then get captured, however, Sara's accomplices distract the police long enough for Sara to escape. SPO1 Arellano (Simon Ibarra), the head of Isabella's kidnapping case, then has a confrontation with Sara which ends in him shooting Sara. Injured and fighting for her life, Sara then calls Edward to rescue her and also to treat her gunshot wound. Rebecca then finds out on what happened to Sara after overhearing Kara's conversation with SPO1 Arellano. Kara then starts to worry that Rebecca will sent her again as a result. Alex and Julio then start to worry that Sara might not actually be dead, and that she is getting ready to get her vengeance against them. Meanwhile, Barbara continues her investigation with Laura in helping prove Sara and Lucille's innocence. She then pays a visit to Flor Bautista's parents, whom ironically, own a supermarket by using the money that Alex paid Flor to tell the court that Sara ordered her to give Isabella's baby pin to Lucille. Flor's parents then inform Barbara that their daughter has left the country. The couple then stiffen and tell Barbara to leave, asking her to let them have a peace of mind and not to involve them, or Flor, in any of Lucille's nor the Suarez family's affairs. Later on, Sebastian returns to the Suarez household, bringing Hannah and Rebecca's passport, preparing from their departure abroad. Rebecca, who is melancholy about joining them, reluctantly agrees to go with them in order to please Kara and Sebastian. However, Rebecca refuses to leave for abroad without saying her farewells to Sara. Banjo then sneaks Sara into the Suarez household. Unfortunately, Hannah saw the two. Meanwhile, Alex and Julio attempt to further incriminate Sara by kidnapping Rebecca and bringing her to a remote destination.

Julio then finds out; he plans to bring Alex and Patricia abroad. Meanwhile, Patricia decides to meet with Paolo, however, Julio follows her. He then goes into a rage, causing him to bring out his gun threatening to shoot Paolo. Kara then becomes more suspicious of Alex and she and Itoy follow her. However, Alex sees her and orders her driver to run over Kara. Itoy then shields her, pushes her out of the way, which causes him to get a sprained ankle from the impact. Sebastian, who is desperate to get to the bottom of who kidnapped Isabella, makes Alex believe that he is on her side, rather than Kara's. Alex then believes Sebastian's tactics and decides to reconcile with him. Complications further arise in Alex and Julio's lives when Dina, Alex's accomplice in kidnapping Isabella, is revealed to be alive. Alex and Julio then become aware of this; they then order their henchmen to kill Dina. However, Sara arrives and rescues Dina and her mother. Sara then begs for Dina to help her clean her name. Fortunately, Dina feels guilty about her actions and decides to confess her crimes to police. Dina then goes the police station, admits her crimes, and also points out that Sara is innocent.

Kara then confronts Alex, telling her how much pain she went through when Isabella was kidnapped from her and Sebastian. Kara then tells Alex that she treated her like family, despite her previous connivance with Lucille in destroying her family. The two then get into a heated confrontation, which is then stopped by Sebastian. Sebastian tells Alex that he will make her pay for her crimes and that he did things for her that she did not even deserve. Later, Sebastian explains to Kara that Alex never felt loved by their mother, Lorena (Maila Gumila), and how she was never satisfied with anything. He then adds that Alex's only ally was their father, Delfin (unseen). Julio later tells Alex that he has ordered his men to stop Dina. In the meantime, the Suarez family are rejoicing since Sara will be proven innocent and Rebecca will soon return. That night, Kara and Sebastian then fully reconcile, promising to uphold the promise of punishing Alex, doing whatever it takes.

Alex then confronts Sebastian who then reveals to her that she is not Lorena and Delfin's daughter, but in fact, their father's daughter from another woman. Betrayed, Alex rebuffs all of Sebastian's attempts in reconciling, and feels heartbroken because they are not full siblings. Furious about this, Alex decides to not have mercy on the Suarez family, and decides to pursue her revenge on them. Dina, who finally is ready to testify, recaps all the events from the planning of Isabella's kidnapping to the day that it was executed. Dina then reveals to SPO1 Arellano that Alex ordered to kidnap Isabella, then planted Isabella on Sara's footstep, and then finally ordered Flor Bautista to give the child's baby pin to Lucille.
