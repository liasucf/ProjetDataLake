The station was originally built and operated by the C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway and then added to Ferrocarril Mitre network. It is currently operated by two companies: State-owned Trenes Argentinos (for passenger services) and private Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) that runs freight trains on the line. ==History== Station's restaurant hall. Ticket offices. In 1863, the government of Argentina granted British-owned company Central Argentine Railway, led by engineer William Wheelwright, a concession to build and exploit a railway line between the cities of Rosario (a major port in southern Santa Fe, on the Paran\u00e1 River) and C\u00f3rdoba (a large city near the geographical center of Argentina, and the capital of the province of the same name). The grant included a clause to populate the lands along and around the railway that were given to the company by the national state. The construction works started in April 1863 with the establishment of the terminus in Rosario, at Rosario Central Station. The line, a broad gauge railway, reached Villa Mar\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba, in September 1867 and the works ceased. Minister Rawson expressed dissatisfaction at the paralysis of the works while passengers also protested against poor conditions of the service. The works for the Rosario Central station and other intermediate stations had not begun. The company alleged that they could not continue the extension of the line until the pending lands were given. In September 1867 the Government authorized a new disbursement of funds for $1,500,000 to conclude the pending works. Finally in March 1870 the railway reached the city of C\u00f3rdoba and it was officially inaugurated by then President of Argentina Domingo Sarmiento on April 13. The CAR was the longest railway system at that time and the first to join two provinces. In 1948, British and French-owned railways in Argentina were nationalised by the Juan Per\u00f3n's administration. The Central Argentine Railway line was added to Mitre Railway network, being subsequently operated by State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos that ran services to C\u00f3rdoba station. When the entire Argentine railway network was privatised in the early 1990s by the Carlos Menem's presidency, passenger services to C\u00f3rdoba were closed. Nevertheless, the station continued to be operated by private company Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) that had been granted concession to operate freight services on the line. The station building (constructed in neoclassical architecture style and in perfect state of preservation) was declared Historic Heritage of C\u00f3rdoba in 1995. Passenger trains were reactivated by private company Ferrocentral, that reestablished services from C\u00f3rdoba to Villa Mar\u00eda (in August 2004) and from Retiro (Buenos Aires) to C\u00f3rdoba in April 2005. In November 2014, the Government of Argentina (through the State-owned company Trenes Argentinos S.A.) took over the services to Rosario (norte), Tucum\u00e1n and C\u00f3rdoba, leaving Ferrocentral inactive. == See also == * Mitre Railway * Trenes Argentinos ==References== ==External links== *Trenes Argentinos, operator Category:Railway stations in Argentina Category:Railway stations opened in 1886 ",
