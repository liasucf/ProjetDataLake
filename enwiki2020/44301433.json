Bassist Billy Gould later revealed in an interview to Rolling Stone that the band was on the way to release a new album in April 2015, also stating \"Motherfucker\" was going to be the first single from it, with a limited print of 5,000 seven-inch copies on Record Store Day.

Weingarten of Rolling Stone wrote that the song \"marches forth with the doom-laden raps of their 1989 breakthrough The Real Thing, the triumphant choruses of their 1997 swan-song Album of the Year, the moan-to- screech dynamics of Mike Patton's avant-minded solo career and a merciless snare cadence tip-tapping at the edges of sanity.\" Gregory Adams of Exclaim! stated the song \"takes on properties of the FNM of old, whether it be Mike Patton's The Real Thing rap cadence, or the way the vocalist can easily turn out soaring vocal melodies to gruff and grizzly growls targeting the 'motherfucker' that tricked them in their youth.\" Adams also further added: \"The music is likewise epic, evolving from spacious and sinister piano lines into a grand rock escapade.\" Ed Keeble of Gigwise described the track as \"very rude, very noisy, very political: all the prerequisites that make a Faith No More song awesome.\" ==Personnel== ;Faith No More * Mike Bordin \u2013 drums * Roddy Bottum \u2013 keyboards, vocals * Billy Gould \u2013 bass guitar, producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer * Jon Hudson \u2013 guitar * Mike Patton \u2013 vocals ;Production * Billy Gould \u2013 producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer * Maor Appelbaum \u2013 mastering engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
