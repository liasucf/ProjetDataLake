The designation Type 96 indicates the year of its introduction, K\u014dki year 2596 or 1936 according to Gregorian calendar. == History == left Since the successful Siege of Port Arthur, during the Russo-Japanese War heavy howitzer development had taken high priority. The Imperial Japanese Army's Armstrong designed 28 cm howitzer L/10 had been instrumental in destroying Port Arthur's defenses and sinking the fleet anchored in its harbor. This resulted in the development of several siege guns, which could be also be used as siege and coastal defense guns. The first was the Type 45 24 cm Howitzer which weighed and required a crew of 50 men two days to set up. The second was the Type 7 30 cm howitzer which was introduced in 1918. The short barreled version weighed while the long barreled version weighed . Although both were powerful weapons their weight was considered excessive and this negatively affected their mobility. Although satisfied with both designs two new guns were ordered during 1936, the Type 96 15 cm howitzer and the Type 96 24 cm howitzer. Both were lighter and more mobile than their predecessors but while the Type 96 15 cm was successful the Type 96 24 cm was a failure due to excessive shot dispersion and inconsistent range which were never resolved. Therefore only eight Type 96 24 cm howitzers were built. For transport, the Type 96 24 cm howitzer, could be broken down into four loads and towed by tractors. Once onsite, a turntable was assembled and firmly anchored to the ground. The gun was then mounted on the turntable and had 120\u00b0 of traverse and +65\u00b0 of elevation. === Pacific War === The Type 96 first saw action during the Philippines Campaign in 1942, when the US-Philippine forces withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula. The first Japanese attacks failed due to stiff Allied resistance so the Commander-in-Chief of the 14th Army, Lieutenant-General Masaharu Homma brought up heavy artillery units to prepare for renewed attacks. Among the 300 guns deployed were two Type 96 howitzers of the 2nd Independent Heavy Artillery Company. On April 3, 1942 the Japanese guns opened fire at 9AM and continued until 2PM. In the six-hour bombardment, 80 rounds were fired by the 2nd Independent Heavy Artillery Company. On May 4, 1942, the Japanese began bombarding the island fortress of Corregidor. During the course of the bombardment Type 96 and Type 45 24 cm howitzers fired a total of 2,915 rounds. Corregidor eventually fell on May 6, 1942. === Japanese-Soviet War === In 1945, Type 96 howitzers were moved to Manchuria Kot\u014d Fortress to strengthen the Japanese defense in preparation for a Soviet attack. The Japanese army had built eight fortresses along the border with the Soviet Union, of which the Kot\u014d fortress on the Ussuri River was the strongest. Large-scale fortifications, similar to the Maginot Line, were guarded by the 4th Border Guard Unit. The 1400-strong crew had two batteries of field guns and howitzers, the Type 90 240 mm railway gun, and the Experimental 41-cm Howitzer. When the Red Army attacked the Japanese positions around Kot\u014d fortress in Operation August Storm in August 1945, the crew was annihilated. == References == ==External links== Category:240 mm artillery Category:World War II artillery of Japan Category:Siege artillery ",
