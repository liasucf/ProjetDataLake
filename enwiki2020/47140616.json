    "text": "The Bangalore Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Indian Army formed in 1904 as a result of the Kitchener Reforms. It was mobilized as 27th (Bangalore) Brigade at the outbreak of the First World War. As part of Indian Expeditionary Force B, it was sent to assault Tanga in German East Africa. With the failure of the Battle of Tanga, its units joined the defences of British East Africa and it was broken up. The brigade was reformed in India in 1917 for internal security duties and to aid the expansion of the Indian Army in the last year of the war. It, too, was disbanded in 1926. A 2nd Bangalore Brigade also existed from 1904 to 1911. ==1st Bangalore Brigade== The Kitchener Reforms, carried out during Lord Kitchener's tenure as Commander-in- Chief, India (1902\u201309), completed the unification of the three former Presidency armies, the Punjab Frontier Force, the Hyderabad Contingent and other local forces into one Indian Army. Kitchener identified the Indian Army's main task as the defence of the North-West Frontier against foreign aggression (particularly Russian expansion into Afghanistan) with internal security relegated to a secondary role. The Army was organized into divisions and brigades that would act as field formations but also included internal security troops. The 1st Bangalore Brigade was formed in December 1904 as a result of the Kitchener Reforms. The brigade formed part of the 9th (Secunderabad) Division. In 1906, the 2nd Bangalore Brigade was renamed as the Bangalore Cavalry Brigade, and the 1st Brigade became simply the Bangalore Brigade. ;27th (Bangalore) Brigade In August 1914, Indian Expeditionary Force B was intended to assault Dar es Salaam in German East Africa with 16th (Poona) Brigade as its nucleus. In the event, 16th (Poona) Brigade was mobilized with 6th (Poona) Division and sent to Mesopotamia. Instead, Bangalore Brigade was mobilized on 10 September 1914 as the 27th (Bangalore) Brigade along with the Imperial Service Infantry Brigade. The Force sailed from Bombay on 16 October with Tanga as the target for an attack. After the failure of the Battle of Tanga (2\u20135 November), the Force disembarked at Mombassa and joined the defences of British East Africa. The brigade was broken up at this point. ;Reformed brigade The Bangalore Brigade was reformed in 9th (Secunderabad) Division in January 1917. It remained with the division for the rest of the war, carrying out internal security duties. In the final year of the war, the division (and brigade) took part in the general expansion of the Indian Army as new units were formed. It was disbanded in 1926. ===Orders of battle=== {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !In India in August 1914 |- |At the outbreak of the First World War, the brigade had the following composition: * 2nd Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment * 61st King George's Own Pioneers (joined Indian Expeditionary Force B as Force Troops) * 101st Grenadiers * 108th Infantry (transferred to Bombay in October 1914) * IV Brigade, RFA \u2013 7th, 14th and 66th Batteries (joined 3rd (Lahore) Division in August 1914 and departed for the Western Front) |} {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !East African Campaign |- |The brigade's composition for its involvement in the East African Campaign was: * 2nd Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment * 63rd Palamcottah Light Infantry (joined in September 1914 from Jubbulpore Brigade, 5th (Mhow) Division) * 98th Infantry (joined in September 1914 from Jubbulpore Brigade, 5th (Mhow) Division) * 101st Grenadiers |} {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !Reformed brigade |- |The reformed brigade commanded the following units: * 74th Punjabis (arrived from Hong Kong in May 1915; transferred in June to Jubbulpore Brigade, 5th (Mhow) Division) * 2nd Battalion, 88th Carnatic Infantry (formed in July 1918) * 2nd Battalion, 75th Carnatic Infantry (formed in October 1918) * 2nd Battalion, 73rd Carnatic Infantry formed in Southern Brigade in June 1918 and the brigade in December 1918) |} ===1st / 27th Brigade commanders=== The 1st Bangalore Brigade / Bangalore Brigade / 27th (Bangalore) Brigade / Bangalore Brigade had the following commanders: {| class=\"wikitable\" !
