    "text": "The Battle of Uruzgan was fought in 1893 CE between Pashtuns and the Hazara ethnic group of Afghanistan. Thereafter, on Hazara defeat, the Hazaras of the Uruzgani tribe were uprooted from Uruzgan by Abdur Rahman Khan and Pashtun tribes were resettled in Uruzgan. Some Uruzgani refugees migrated to Iran and British India (Quetta). In 1901, Amir Habibullah Khan granted amnesty to the migrated Hazaras and asked them to return. Some returning Uruzgani Hazaras were then resettled in Afghan Turkistan and Balkh Province, but were not allowed to return to Uruzgan. ==References== Category:History of Urozgan Province Uruzgan Category:Hazara people Category:Hazara history Uruzgan Category:1893 in Afghanistan ",
