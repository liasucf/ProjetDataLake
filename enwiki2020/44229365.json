    "text": "The Second Afar insurgency is an ongoing insurgency in the Afar Region of Ethiopia and the Southern Red Sea Region of Eritrea (also known as Dankalia), waged by various Afar rebel groups. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have supported different rebel groups in the region in a proxy war, and have occasionally engaged in border skirmishes with each other, as well as with opposing rebel groups. == Background == The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) was founded in 1993, through the merging of three Afar rebel groups, the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Union, the Afar Ummatah Demokrasiyyoh Focca (AUDF), and the Afar Revolutionary Forces (ARF). The three groups were united under the goal of creating an independent state in the Afar Region. The group operates within Ethiopia, allegedly receiving Eritrean support. In 1995, ARDUF perpetrated its first attack, kidnapping an Italian tourist. The victim was later released unharmed. The Red Sea Afar Democratic Organisation (RSADO) was founded in 1999. Along with the Eritrean National Salvation Front (ENSF), the group operates from bases located in Ethiopia, launching attacks into Eritrean territory. Both groups are allegedly supported by Ethiopia. == Timeline == === Prior the 2000s === * In 1995, ARDUF insurgents kidnapped and later released an Italian tourist. === 2000\u20132009 === * In 2002, a splinter faction of ARDUF abandoned the insurgency, and joined the Ethiopian political scene. * In 2003, ARDUF issued a statement, forbidding foreigners from entering the Afar region. * In March 2007, ARDUF kidnapped five European tourists and 13 Ethiopians in the Danakil Depression. * On 16 November 2008, RSADO insurgents claimed to have killed over 285 Eritrean military officers including top military leaders in a military training center, in the remote Dankalia region of the Afambo local area.
