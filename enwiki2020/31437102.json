It is now gone but on its site at Omey Island sits a medieval church, completely buried in sand until it was excavated in 1981. The monastery continued until at least the early 12th century, when the Annals of Ulster under the year 1017 state Gormgal of Int Ardail\u00e9an, chief confessor of Ireland, rested in Christ. One of the important manuscripts of the Life of St. Feichin was written on the island. ==See also== * F\u00e9ch\u00edn of Fore died 665. * Enda of Aran, died c. 530. * Ceannanach, missionary, fl. c. 490-500? * Gillagori Ua Dubhacan, Abbot of Aran, died 1167. ==External links== * http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001A/ * http://irishislands.info/ard.html * http://www.goireland.com/galway/high-island-early-monastery-attraction- monastery-id13019.htm * https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res;=9B00E5D7113EF932A3575BC0A96F958260 Category:People from County Galway Category:11th-century Irish people Category:1017 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
