    "text": "John Richard Kasich Jr. ( ; born May 13, 1952) is an American politician, author, and television news host who served as the 69th Governor of Ohio from 2011 to 2019. He is a Republican and unsuccessfully sought the party's presidential nomination in 2000 and 2016. Kasich grew up in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, moving to Ohio to attend college. After a single term in the Ohio Senate he served nine terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing from 1983 to 2001. His tenure in the House included 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee and six years as chairman of the House Budget Committee. He was a key figure in the passage of both 1996 welfare reform legislation and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Kasich decided not to run for re-election in 2000, instead running for president. He withdrew before the Republican primaries. After leaving Congress, Kasich hosted Heartland with John Kasich on Fox News from 2001 to 2007 and was a fill-in host for The O'Reilly Factor. He also worked as an investment banker, serving as managing director of the Lehman Brothers office in Columbus, Ohio. In the 2010 Ohio gubernatorial election, Kasich defeated Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. He was reelected in 2014, defeating Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald by 30 percentage points. In the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Kasich finished third behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz at the convention. He won his home state of Ohio and finished second in New Hampshire. He subsequently received one Electoral College vote from a faithless elector in Texas. Kasich declined to support Trump as the Republican nominee and did not attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which was held in Ohio, where he was Governor at the time. In the general election he voted for John McCain as a write-in candidate. Kasich was term- limited and could not seek a third gubernatorial term in 2018; he was succeeded by Mike DeWine. In 2019, he joined CNN as a contributor. He is one of the most prominent critics of Trump within the Republican Party, although he declined to challenge him in the 2020 presidential primary, and endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. ==Early life, education, and early political career== Kasich (right), aged 18, meeting President Nixon in 1970 at the White House, when he was an Ohio State University freshman John Richard Kasich Jr. was born and raised in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. He is the son of Anne (n\u00e9e Vukovich; 1918-1987) and John Kasich Sr. (1919-1987), who worked as a mail carrier. Kasich's father was of Czech descent, while his mother was of Croatian descent. Both his father and mother were children of immigrants and were practicing Roman Catholics. He has described himself as \"a Croatian and a Czech\". After attending public schools in his hometown of McKees Rocks, Kasich later left his native Pennsylvania, settling in Columbus, Ohio in 1970 to attend The Ohio State University, where he joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. As a freshman, he wrote a letter to President Richard Nixon describing concerns he had about the nation and requesting a meeting with the President. The letter was delivered to Nixon by the university's president Novice Fawcett and Kasich was granted a 20-minute meeting with Nixon in December 1970. Earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from The Ohio State University, in 1974, he went on to work as a researcher for the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. From 1975-78, he served as an administrative assistant to then-state Senator Buz Lukens. ==Ohio Senate career== In 1978, Kasich ran against Democratic incumbent Robert O'Shaughnessy for State Senate. A political ally of Kasich remembers him during that time as a persistent campaigner: \"People said, 'If you just quit calling me, I'll support you.'\" At age 26, Kasich won with 56% of the vote, beginning his four- year term representing the 15th district. Kasich was the second youngest person ever elected to the Ohio Senate. One of his first acts as a State Senator was to refuse a pay raise. Republicans gained control of the State Senate in 1980; but Kasich went his own way, for example, by opposing a budget proposal he believed would raise taxes and writing his own proposal instead. == U.S. House of Representatives (1983\u20132001) == In 1982, Kasich ran for Congress in Ohio's 12th congressional district, which included portions of Columbus as well as the cities of Westerville, Reynoldsburg, Worthington, and Dublin. He won the Republican primary with 83% of the vote and defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Bob Shamansky in the general election by a margin of 50%\u201347%. He would never face another contest nearly that close, and was re-elected eight more times with at least 64 percent of the vote. During his congressional career, Kasich was considered a fiscal conservative, taking aim at programs supported by Republicans and Democrats. He worked with Ralph Nader in seeking to reduce corporate tax loopholes. Kasich was a member of the House Armed Services Committee for 18 years. He developed a \"fairly hawkish\" reputation on that committee, although he \"also zealously challenged\" defense spending he considered wasteful. Among the Pentagon projects that he targeted were the B-2 bomber program (teaming up with Democratic representative Ron Dellums to cut the program, their efforts were partly successful) and the A-12 bomber program (ultimately canceled by defense secretary Dick Cheney in 1991). He participated extensively in the passage of the Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act of 1986, which reorganized the U.S. Department of Defense. He also pushed through the bill creating the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which closed obsolete U.S. military bases, and successfully opposed a proposed $110 million expansion of the Pentagon building after the end of the Cold War. He also \"proposed a national commission on arms control\" and \"urged tighter controls over substances that could be used for biological warfare.\" Kasich as a congressman in 1985.Kasich meeting with Ronald Reagan. Kasich said he was \"100 percent for\" the first Persian Gulf War as well as the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, but said that he did not favor U.S. military participation in the Lebanese Civil War or in Bosnia. In 1997, with fellow Republican representative Floyd Spence, he introduced legislation (supported by some congressional Democrats) for the U.S. to pull out of a multilateral peacekeeping force in Bosnia. In the House, he supported the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, a U.S. Representative Ron Dellums (D- CA)-led initiative to impose economic sanctions against apartheid- era South Africa. ===Ranking member of the House Budget Committee=== House Budget committee. In 1993, Kasich became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee. Kasich and other House Budget Committee Republicans proposed an alternative to President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction bill, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That proposal included funds to implement Republican proposals for health care, welfare, and crime control legislation and for a child tax credit. The Penny-Kasich Plan, named after Kasich and fellow lead sponsor Tim Penny, was supported by Republicans and conservative Democrats. It proposed $90 billion in spending cuts over five years, almost three times as much in cuts as the $37 billion in cuts backed by the Clinton administration and Democratic congressional leaders. About one-third ($27 billion) of the proposed Penny-Kasich cuts would come from means-testing Medicare, specifically by reducing Medicare payments to seniors who earned $75,000 or more in adjusted gross income. This angered the AARP, which lobbied against the legislation. Another $26 billion of the Penny-Kasich plan's cuts would have come from the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign aid, which led Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to say that the plan would destroy military morale. Another $27 billion in savings would have come from federal layoffs. The proposal was narrowly defeated in the House by a 219-213 vote. As ranking member of the Budget Committee, Kasich proposed his own health care reform plan as a rival to the Clinton health care plan of 1993 championed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, but more market-based. As journalist Zeke Miller wrote in Time magazine, \"The Kasich plan would have covered all Americans by 2005, using a form of an individual mandate that would have required employees to purchase insurance through their employers. (The mandate was an idea initially supported by conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation.)\" On November 17, 1993, Kasich voted to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement, casting a \"yea\" vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. In 1994, Kasich was one of the Republican leaders to support a last-minute deal with President Bill Clinton to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. After a series of meetings with Clinton's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, a longtime friend of Kasich, the assault weapons ban was passed when 42 Republicans crossed party lines and voted to ban assault weapons with the Democrats. His support of the assault-weapons ban angered the National Rifle Association, which gave Kasich an \"F\" rating in 1994 as a result. ===Chair of the House Budget Committee=== Kasich as chair of the House Budget Committee In 1995, when Republicans gained the majority in the United States Congress following the 1994 election, Kasich became chair of the House Budget Committee. In 1996, he introduced the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in the House, an important welfare reform bill signed into law by President Clinton. During the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Bob Dole was reported to have considered Kasich as a vice presidential running mate but instead selected Jack Kemp, a former congressman and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Balanced Budget Act of 1997 signing, when Kasich chaired the House Budget Committee. In 1997, Kasich rose to national prominence after becoming \"the chief architect of a deal that balanced the federal budget for the first time since 1969\"--the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In 1998, Kasich voted to impeach President Clinton on all four charges made against him. In 1999, while the Senate prepared to vote on the charges, he said: \"I believe these are impeachable and removable offenses.\" == 2000 presidential campaign == Kasich did not seek re-election in 2000. In February 1999, he formed an exploratory committee to run for president.Kasich forms exploratory committee to run for president, CNN (February 15, 1999). In March 1999 he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. After very poor fundraising, he dropped out in July 1999, before the Iowa Straw Poll, and endorsed governor George W. Bush of Texas. == Private sector career (2001\u20132009) == After leaving Congress, Kasich went to work for Fox News, hosting Heartland with John Kasich on the Fox News Channel and guest-hosting The O'Reilly Factor, filling in for Bill O'Reilly as needed. He also occasionally appeared as a guest on Hannity & Colmes. === Business career === Kasich served on the board of directors for several corporations, including Invacare Corp. and the Chicago-based Norvax Inc. In 2001, Kasich joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking division as a managing director, in Columbus, Ohio. He remained at Lehman Brothers until it declared bankruptcy in 2008. That year, Lehman Brothers paid him a $182,692 salary and a $432,200 bonus. He stated that the bonus was for work performed in 2007. Kasich's employment by Lehman Brothers was criticized during his subsequent campaigns in light of the firm's collapse during the financial crisis. Kasich responded to critics by saying: \"I wasn't involved in the inner workings of Lehman, I was a banker. I didn't go to board meetings or go and talk investment strategy with the top people. I was nowhere near that. That's like, it's sort of like being a car dealer in Zanesville and being blamed for the collapse of GM.\" === Political activities from 2001 to 2009=== Republicans made efforts to recruit Kasich to run for Ohio governor in 2006, but he declined to enter the race. In 2008, Kasich formed Recharge Ohio, a political action committee (PAC) with the goal of raising money to help Republican candidates for the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate, in an effort to retain Republican majorities in the Ohio General Assembly.Joe Hallett, Kasich creates PAC to help Ohio GOP retain power, Columbus Dispatch (July 15, 2008). Kasich served as honorary chairman of the PAC.Kevin Risner, Kasich announces leadership team for Ohio PAC, Advertiser-Tribune (February 17, 2009). == Governor of Ohio == === 2010 election === On May 1, 2009, Kasich filed papers to run for governor of Ohio against incumbent Democratic governor Ted Strickland. He formally announced his candidacy on June 1, 2009. On January 15, 2010, Kasich announced Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor as his running mate. During a speech before Ashtabula County Republicans in March 2009, Kasich talked about the need to \"break the back of organized labor in the schools,\" according to the Ashtabula Star Beacon.Points of division: Jobs dominate, but 'hot button' issues remain important in governor's race, Columbus Dispatch Kasich with John Boehner, Barack Obama and Joe Biden in June 2011 Ohio teachers' unions supported Strickland, and after Kasich's gubernatorial victory, he said, \"I am waiting for the teachers' unions to take out full-page ads in all the major newspapers, apologizing for what they had to say about me during this campaign.\" Elsewhere, he said he was willing to work with \"unions that make things.\"Unions that 'make things' will get chance to help | Columbus Dispatch Politics On May 4, 2010, Kasich won the Republican nomination for governor, having run unopposed. On November 2, 2010, Kasich defeated Strickland in a closely contested race to win the governorship. He was sworn in at midnight on January 10, 2011, in a private ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. It was then followed by a ceremonial inauguration at the Ohio Theatre at noon on the same day. === 2014 re-election campaign === In November 2014, Kasich won re-election, defeating Democrat Ed FitzGerald, the county executive of Cuyahoga County, 64% to 33%. He won 86 of 88 counties. Kasich, who was elected with Tea Party support in 2010, faced some backlash from some Tea Party activists. His decision to accept the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid caused some Tea Party activists to refuse to support his campaign.Terkel, Amanda (March 11, 2013). John Kasich Faces Tea Party Protest Over Medicaid Decision, The Huffington Post. Retrieved 2014-12-24. Kasich supported longtime ally and campaign veteran Matt Borges over Portage County Tea Party chairman Tom Zawistowski for the position of chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. Zawistowski secured just three votes in his run for the chairmanship.Green, Justin (May 6, 2013). Why Does the Tea Party Want to Let Democrats Run Ohio?, The Daily Beast. Retrieved 2014-12-24.

Ohio Republican Party Goes to War With Itself, Leaving 2016 in Doubt, The Daily Beast. Retrieved 2014-12-24. Ultimately, Zawistowski failed to field anyone on the ballot and the Libertarian nominee (former Republican State Representative Charlie Earl) was removed from the ballot after failing to gain the required number of valid signatures necessary for ballot access.Joe Vardon, Libertarians angry at GOP while acknowledging faults, The Columbus Dispatch ( March 9, 2014). ==Political positions and record== The Guardian reports that Kasich is sometimes \"billed as a moderate\" due to his \"unassuming image,\" but has a record in the House and as Ohio governor that \"puts him a big step to the right of what many Americans would consider in the middle.\" Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, who has known Kasich for years, says that \"If you had asked me in the 90s about Kasich I would have said he was a Gingrich conservative.\"Joanna Walters, John Kasich has been billed as moderate candidate, but his record is anything but, The Guardian (February 11, 2016). Kasich's friend Curt Steiner, former chief of staff to former Republican Ohio governor and U.S. senator George Voinovich, described Kasich as a \"solid Republican\" with \"an independent streak.\" ===Abortion=== Kasich opposed the fetal heart beat law and says abortions should only be performed in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's life is in danger. As governor, he signed 18 abortion restrictive measures into law. In June 2013, Kasich signed into law a state budget, HB 59, which stripped some $1.4 million in federal dollars from Planned Parenthood by placing the organization last on the priority list for family-planning funds; provided funding to crisis pregnancy centers; and required women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds. The budget also barred abortion providers from entering into emergency transfer agreements with public hospitals, requiring abortion providers to find private hospitals willing to enter into transfer agreements. Another provision of the bill requires abortion providers to offer information on family planning and adoption services in certain situations. Under the budget, rape crisis centers could lose public funding if they counseled sexual assault victims about abortion. In 2015, Kasich said in an interview that Planned Parenthood \"ought to be de-funded\" but Republicans in Congress should not force a government shutdown over the issue. In December 2016, Kasich approved a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, except when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life, but vetoed HB 493, a law which would have made abortion illegal after detection of a fetal heartbeat (typically 5\u20136 weeks after conception). Kasich cited the cost to taxpayers of defending the legislation in court, and the likelihood that the \"Heartbeat Bill\" would be struck down in federal court as reasons for vetoing the more restrictive bill. In December 2018, Kasich again vetoed a bill to ban abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat citing the cost to taxpayers and previous rulings by the federal courts. He did sign a bill into law that bans the dilation and evacuation procedure commonly used for abortion. ===Climate change, energy, and environment=== In a speech in April 2012, Kasich acknowledged that climate change is real and is a problem.Joe Vardon, Kasich breaks ranks, speaks of climate change, Columbus Dispatch (April 10, 2012). In the same speech, however, Kasich said that the Environmental Protection Agency should not regulate carbon emissions and that instead states and private companies should be in charge of regulating coal- fired power plant emissions. In 2015, Kasich stated that he did not know all the causes of climate change, and that he did not know the extent to which humans contribute to climate change.Rachel Leven & Anthony Adragna, Candidate Kasich Says Climate Change Cause Unclear, Bloomberg BNA (July 21, 2015). In 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill freezing Ohio's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) program for two years.Steven Mufson & Tom Hamburger, Ohio governor signs bill freezing renewable-energy standards, Washington Post (June 13, 2014).John Funk, Ohio renewable energy and efficiency rules frozen for two years as Gov. John Kasich signs legislation, Cleveland Plain Dealer (June 13, 2014). Ohio's RPS program was created by 2008 legislation and required the state to acquire 12.5 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable sources and to reduce energy consumption by 22 percent by 2025. The legislation signed by Kasich to stop the program was supported by Republican legislative leaders, utility companies, and some industry groups, and opposed by environmentalists, some manufacturers, and the American Lung Association. In 2016, Kasich broke with fellow Republicans in the state legislature by vetoing their attempt to continue blocking the RPS standards; as a result, the freeze ended on December 31, 2016, and the clean-energy mandate resumed. This veto won Kasich praise from environmentalist groups, and angered Republicans in the state legislature. * Carrie Blackmore Smith, Kasich breaks with GOP, keeps renewable energy standards, Cincinnati Enquirer (December 27, 2016). * John Funk, Kasich wins strong support from environmentalists for green mandates, Cleveland Plain Dealer (December 27, 2016). In his 2015 budget plan, Kasich proposed raising the tax rate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities.Jeremy Pelzer, Ohio's fracking tax would jump significantly under Gov. John Kasich's budget plan, Cleveland Plain Dealer (February 2, 2015). Specifically, Kasich's plan called for imposing a 6.5 percent severance tax on crude oil and natural gas extracted via horizontal drilling and sold at the source (about $3.25 per $50 barrel of oil), and for an additional 4.5 percent tax per thousand cubic feet on natural gas and liquefied natural gas (about $0.16 per thousand cubic feet). The proposal would not affect conventional drilling taxes. Kasich formerly supported fracking in Ohio state parks and forests, signing legislation in mid-2011 authorizing him to appoint a five-member commission to oversee the leasing of mineral rights on state land to the highest bidders.Eric Albrecht, Kasich reverses on fracking in state parks: Legislators call for investigation into ODNR plan, Columbus Dispatch (February 18, 2014). In 2012, Kasich aides planned a campaign with a stated goal to \"marginalize the effectiveness of communications by adversaries about the initiative\" to bring fracking to state parks and forests, naming in an email the Ohio Sierra Club and state Representatives Robert F. Hagan and Nickie Antonio as adversaries of the plan. Kasich never appointed the commission, and the promotional plan was never put into effect. A memo and email relating to the 2012 promotional campaign were publicly released for the first time in February 2015, which according to the Columbus Dispatch attracted criticism from state environmental and liberal groups, as well as Democratic state legislators, who called for an investigation. On the same day the governor reversed himself, with a spokesman saying, \"At this point, the governor doesn't support fracking in state parks. We reserve the right to revisit that, but it's not what he wants to do right now, and that's been his position for the past year and a half.\" In April 2015, Kasich signed a bill aimed at protecting Lake Erie's water quality.Gov. Kasich signs bill aimed at protecting Lake Erie, Ohio water quality, Toledo Blade.John Seewer, Gov. John Kasich signs new rules to help reduce Lake Erie Algae, Associated Press (April 2, 2015). The bill places restrictions on the spread of manure and other fertilizers that contribute to toxic algal blooms and requires large public water treatment plants to monitor phosphorus levels. The bill had been unanimously approved by both chambers of the Ohio Legislature the previous month. Kasich supported the Keystone XL oil pipeline project and, along with other Republican governors, signed an open letter in February 2015 urging federal approval for the project.Jack Torry, Kasich backs Keystone pipeline, Columbus Dispatch (February 12, 2015). In 2016, in response to a request from South Dakota under the terms of an interstate compact, Kasich dispatched 37 Ohio state troopers to South Dakota, where they were stationed around Dakota Access Pipeline protests near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. This controversial deployment prompted unsuccessful petitions to Kasich (from members of the public, Cincinnati City Council members, environmentalists, and some state legislators), who asked Kasich to recall the troopers. * Randy Ludlow, Ohio troopers return from North Dakota pipeline protest, Columbus Dispatch (November 16, 2016). * Carrie Blackmore Smith, Kasich: I sent Ohio troopers to assist with security at Dakota Access Pipeline, Cincinnati Enquirer (April 17, 2017). ===Policing and criminal justice=== ====Prison privatization==== To offset a state budget deficit, Kasich proposed selling five state prisons to the for-profit prison industry. The Lake Erie prison was sold for $72.7 million to the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), generating savings of $3 million. Kasich's Director of Corrections, Gary Mohr, whom he had hired in January 2011, had previously worked for CCA, but he said that he removed himself from the sales process. In an audit in October 2012, CCA was cited for 47 contractual violations, and failed a second audit later that year.Joe Guillen, Private corrections company with ties to government officials will not get special treatment while Ohio sells five prisons, director says, The Plain Dealer (March 21, 2013).Collier Meyerson, Private prisons and the profit motive, MSNBC (September 13, 2013).German Lopez, From the Inside, City Beat (May 29, 2013).

The last execution in Ohio took place in July 2018. In January 2015, Kasich announced that, due to pending litigation and other issues, he was delaying all seven executions scheduled through January 2016. The delay was largely attributed to European pharmaceutical companies, which have refused to supply the state with deadly drugs necessary for executions.\"Can Europe End the Death Penalty in America?\", Matt Ford. The Atlantic. February 18, 2014. Retrieved 23 jan 2017 In February 2017, Kasich again delayed Ohio executions for an additional three months, after a federal judge ruled that Ohio's three-drug lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional.Rebecca Hersher, [Ohio Postpones 8 Executions Amidst Legal Challenge To Lethal Injection Procedure], NPR (February 10, 2017).Jackie Borchardt, Gov. John Kasich pushes back execution dates for 8 Ohio inmates, Cleveland.com (February 10, 2017). ====Executive clemency==== Kasich speaking in January 2016 Kasich used his power of executive clemency sparingly.Alan Johnson, Kasich stays conservative with pardons, Columbus Dispatch (February 11, 2017). He has the lowest clemency rate of any Ohio governor since at least the 1980s, when records began to be kept. In six years in office, Kasich granted 86 of the 2,291 requests that he acted upon. In 2016, Kasich granted executive clemency to 13 people; in all of the cases, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority had recommended clemency. ====Criminal justice reform issues==== Kasich supports various criminal justice reform efforts; according to conservative Washington Post columnist George Will, Kasich \"favors fewer mandatory minimum sentences and has instituted prison policies that prepare inmates for re-integration into communities.\"George F. Will, Kasich waits in the wings, Washington Post (March 18, 2015). In 2011, Kasich signed sentencing reform legislation which allowed judges to sentence defendants convicted of non-violent fourth- and fifth- degree felonies to \"community-based halfway house facilities\" instead of prison; expanded the earned credit system to allow inmates to reduce their sentences; and allowed felons who have already served 80 percent or more of their sentences to be immediately released.Reginald Fields, Ohio Gov.

In a 2015 interview with radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, Kasich said he was opposed to the legalization of recreational drugs in some states and equated marijuana and heroin, stating: \"In my state and across this country, if I happened to be president, I would lead a significant campaign down at the grassroots level to stomp these drugs out of our country.\"Matt Wilstein, John Kasich Equates Marijuana with Heroin: 'A Scourge in This Country', Mediaite (April 21, 2015).Matt Ferner, Here's Where The GOP's 2016 Presidential Contenders Stand On Marijuana Legalization, Huffington Post (May 6, 2015). When Kasich was asked by Hewitt whether, if elected president, he would federally enforce marijuana laws in states which have legalized marijuana, Kasich characterized it as a states' rights issue and said that \"I'd have to think about it.\" When asked the same question later in 2015, Kasich said: \"I would try to discourage the states from doing it...but I would be tempted to say I don't think we can go and start disrupting what they've decided.\"Jonathan Oosting, Marijuana legalization a 'terrible idea,' says GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich, MLive (September 2, 2015).

Ohio also increased its \"rainy day fund\" from effectively zero to more than $2 billion.Jacobson, Louis, John Kasich: 'I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole ... to a $2 billion surplus', PolitiFact (August 6, 2015). Kasich \"closed the budget shortfall in part by cutting aid to local governments, forcing some of them to raise their own taxes or cut services. And increasing sales taxes helped make the income tax cuts possible.\" An analysis by the Plain Dealer in March 2016 found that more than 70 cities and villages had lost at least $1 million a year due to Kasich's budget and taxation policy. In March 2008, Kasich called for \"phasing out\" Ohio's state income tax. During Kasich's time as governor, Ohio ranked 22nd out of the 50 states for private-sector job growth, at 9.3%.

The budget provided for a 10-percent state income tax cut phased in over three years, and an increase in the state sales tax from 5.5 percent to 5.75 percent. It also included a 50% tax cut for small business owners on the first $250,000 of annual net income. Kasich used his line-item veto power to reject a measure that would stop the Medicaid expansion (which Kasich had accepted from the federal government) to cover nearly 275,000 working poor Ohioans. In 2015, Kasich signed into law a $71 billion two-year state budget after using his line-item veto power to veto 44 items.Julie Carr Smyth, Kasich signs $71B budget after vetoing 44 items, Associated Press (July 1, 2015). The overall 2015 budget provides a 6.3 percent state income-tax cut as a part one component of a $1.9 billion net tax reduction and lowers the top income-tax rate to slightly below 5 percent. The budget also \"spends $955 million more in basic state aid for K-12 schools than the last two-year period\"; \"boosts state funding for higher education to help offset a two-year tuition freeze at public universities\"; expands the Medicaid health program; increases cigarette taxes by 35 cents a pack; and \"prohibits independent health care and child care workers under contract with the state from unionizing.\" ====Senate Bill 5 and labor issues==== On March 31, 2011, in his first year as governor, Kasich signed into law Senate Bill 5, a controversial labor law which restricted collective bargaining rights of public employees, such as police officers, firefighters, and teachers.Robert Higgs, Kasich-O-Meter: Revamp the state's collective bargaining law for public employees, Politifact (March 5, 2013).Ohio's SB 5, Explained, StateImpact/NPR (retrieved September 13, 2015).

I understand their decision. And frankly, I respect what the people have to say in an effort like this.\" Following this defeat, Kasich dropped efforts to pass broad-based collective bargaining restrictions, although in 2012 he supported a bill including \"provisions reminiscent of Senate Bill 5\" but applying only to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. In May 2015, Kasich rescinded executive orders issued by his predecessor Ted Strickland in 2007 and 2008 that provided the right to home health care contractors and in-home child care contractors to collectively bargain with the state.Michelle Everhart, Gov.

He canceled the school-funding formula put into place by his Democratic predecessor, Governor Ted Strickland.Aaron Marshall, Kasich-O-Meter: Scrap Gov. Ted Strickland's evidence-based school funding model, Politifact (June 28, 2012).

John Kasich is doing to public education in his state, Washington Post (July 20, 2015). Kasich supports the Common Core State Standards and has criticized Republicans who turned against it. During Kasich's tenure, funding for traditional public schools declined by about $500 million, while funding for charter schools has increased at least 27 percent. As calculated by the Howard Fleeter/Education Tax Policy Institute, total school funding under Kasich (including both charter and district schools) has ranged from a low of $7.1 billion in fiscal year 2013 to $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2015, which was higher than its previous peak under Kasich's predecessor, Ted Strickland.What has Gov.

Kasich has said that the U.S. \"should've left a base in Iraq\" instead of withdrawing troops in 2011.

However, during his time in Congress, Kasich voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage.Jessica Schulberg, The Reaction John Kasich Got for Accepting Gay Marriage Shows How Far the GOP Has Come, Huffington Post (August 7, 2015). During this period, Kasich supported a ban on same-sex marriage in Ohio and stated that he did not approve of the \"gay lifestyle.\" As governor of Ohio, Kasich signed an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for state employees; this was more narrow than the previous executive order signed by his predecessor because it omitted protections for gender identity.Alan Johnson, Kasich alters order on work rights, The Columbus Dispatch (January 22, 2011). During the 2016 presidential campaign, Kasich struck a more moderate tone compared to his Republican opponents. In June 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that there is a fundamental right to same-sex marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment, Kasich said that he was \"obviously disappointed\"John Kasich: An 'Obviously Disappointed' Record On Equality, Human Rights Campaign (July 21, 2015).Gov. John Kasich responds to gay marriage ruling (video), Dayton Daily News (June 26, 2015). and that he believes in \"traditional marriage,\"Jack Torry, Gov. John Kasich says 'it's time to move on' from same- sex marriage ruling, Columbus Dispatch (June 28, 2015). but that the ruling was \"the law of the land and we'll abide by it\" and that it was \"time to move on\" to other issues. During his time as Ohio governor, Kasich appointed Richard Hodges as Ohio Director of Health, who was the lead-respondent in the case. Kasich indicated that he did not support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to overturn the decision. In response to a debate question about how he would explain his position on same-sex marriage to one of his daughters if she were gay, Kasich responded, \"The court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That's what we're taught when we have strong faith.\"Gov. John Kasich scores political points on gay marriage without embracing it, Cleveland Plain Dealer (August 13, 2015). In September 2015, Kasich commented on the highly publicized case of Kim Davis (the Rowan County, Kentucky clerk who refused to comply with a federal court order directing her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples), saying: \"Now, I respect the fact that this lady doesn't agree but she's also a government employee, she's not running a church, I wouldn't force this on a church.

Hard News By Razor Ray McCoy - March 30, 2018 In December 2018, Kasich signed an executive order extending non-discrimination protections for gender identity, including trans and non-binary identities, to state employees in Ohio. ===Gun policy=== While in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kasich had a mixed record on gun policy.Dan Friedman, How John Kasich Flipped a Mixed Gun Voting Record into an 'A' Grade from the NRA, The Trace (February 5, 2016). He was one of 215 Representatives to vote for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which became law in 1994, but voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (\"Brady Bill\"), which established current background check laws. As governor, Kasich shifted to more pro-gun positions. In 2011, he signed one bill permitting concealed handguns in bars and another making it easier for people with misdemeanor drug convictions to purchase guns. In 2012, Kasich signed a bill allowing gun owners to transport weapons with loaded magazines in their vehicles and expanding concealed carry permit reciprocity. In December 2014, Kasich signed legislation that reduced the numbers of hours of training required to obtain a concealed carry permit and eliminated the training requirement for permit renewals. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, Kasich called for restrictions on the sales of AR-15 style rifles. ===Health care=== Kasich opted to accept Medicaid- expansion funding provided by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\") in Ohio.Benen, Steve.

This decision angered many Statehouse Republicans, who wanted Kasich to reject the expansion.Domenico Montanaro, Ohio Republican Gov. Kasich On Expanding Medicaid: 'It's My Money', NPR (May 1, 2015). Total spending on Medicaid by the state was almost $2 billion (or 7.6 percent) below estimates for the fiscal year ending in June 2015, according to a report by Kasich's administration. The lower-than-expected costs were attributed to expanded managed care, shorter nursing home stays and increased in-home care for seniors, capitated reimbursement policies, increased automation to determine eligibility for the program and pay care providers, and an improving economy in the state which allowed some participants to move out of the program.Catherine Candisky, Ohio's Medicaid costs $2 billion less than estimates, Columbus Dispatch (August 13, 2015). In an October 2014 interview, Kasich said that repeal of the ACA was \"not gonna happen\" and stated that \"The opposition to it was really either political or ideological. I don't think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people's lives.\" Kasich later said that he was referring solely to the law's Medicaid expansion, and that \"my position is that we need to repeal and replace\" the rest of the law.Tom LoBianco, Kasich says he's not an Obamacare hypocrite, CNN (May 27, 2015). In 2015, Kasich expressed support for many provisions of the ACA (ensuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the use of insurance exchanges, and Medicaid expansion), but opposed mandates.Chrissie Thompson, Kasich-care: Priorities like Obamacare, without mandates, Cincinnati Enquirer (August 16, 2015). In 2017, after Donald Trump took office and congressional Republicans maneuvered to repeal the ACA, Kasich criticized Republican hard-liners in Congress who demanded a full ACA repeal, saying that full repeal was \"not acceptable\" when 20 million people gained insurance under the ACA and that doing so would be a \"political impossibility.\" Kasich urged that the Medicaid expansion be preserved in some form, criticizing the House Republican legislation that would cut the Medicaid expansion and phase out health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans. *Emily Schultheis, Ohio Gov.

In May 2017, Kasich said that the version of the Republican health care bill that passed the House was \"inadequate\" and would harm patients; Kasich said that Republicans \"should've worked with the Democrats\" on the bill rather than passing legislation merely to fulfill a campaign pledge.Jennifer Calfas, John Kasich Says GOP Health Care Bill Is 'Inadequate', Time (May 7, 2017). In June 2017, Kasich said that he didn't \"have a problem\" with gradually phasing out the ACA's expansion of Medicaid over a seven-year period, but only if Congress provided states with significantly more, more than the House Republican bill provided for, and only if Congress granted states more authority to manage the program.Robert Pear, John Kasich Backs Slow Medicaid Rollback, but With More Money, New York Times (June 12, 2017). Along with three other Republican governors (Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, and Rick Snyder of Michigan), Kasich signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with an outline of their wishes for an health care bill. Kasich and the others specifically called upon Congress to \"end the requirement that state Medicaid programs cover nearly every prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\" Kasich and the other governors' views were seen as influential, because their states have Republican senators and the Republicans have only a narrow majority in the Senate. ===Immigration and refugees=== In 2010, while running for governor, Kasich expressed support for amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of jus soli (birthright) citizenship for people born in the United States. Kasich also told the Columbus Dispatch at the time that \"One thing that I don't want to reward is illegal immigration.\" In 2014, Kasich acknowledged that his stance on immigration has \"evolved\" because \"maybe [I'm] a little smarter now,\" stating: \"I don't want to see anybody in pain. So I guess when I look at this now, I look at it differently than I did in '10. ... When I look at a group of people who might be hiding, who may be afraid, who may be scared, who have children, I don't want to be in a position of where I make it worse for them.\" That year, Kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, saying at a Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting in Florida, \"I don't like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, [but] we may have to do it.\"Anna Louie Sussman, Kasich Backs Path to Legal Status for Undocumented Immigrants, Wall Street Journal (August 9, 2015).

Kasich also appeared to disavow his earlier stance against birthright citizenship, stating \"I don't think we need to go there\"; called for completion of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border; and noted that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children may obtain driver's licenses in Ohio. In October 2015, Kasich criticized Donald Trump's \"plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and remove immigrants who entered the United States illegally,\" calling these notions \"just crazy.\" In September 2015, Kasich said that the U.S. had a moral responsibility to accept refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria. Subsequently, however, Kasich moved to the right, and in November 2015 wrote a letter to President Obama asking that no additional Syrian refugees be resettled in Ohio.Alan Rappeport, John Kasich Shifts His Stand on Accepting Refugees, New York Times (November 17, 2015). Kasich opposed Trump's executive order on travel and immigration, which Trump signed one week after taking office in January 2017. Kasich said that the order was \"ham-handed\" because it \"sowed so much confusion\" and \"sent a message that somehow the United States was looking sideways at Muslims.\" ===Lieutenant governor=== Kasich has a \"long-standing political partnership\" with his lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor.Henry J.

John Kasich's all-white Cabinet only matters if he fails to create jobs: Phillip Morris, Cleveland Plain Dealer (January 21, 2011). Responding to criticism for not appointing any black, Hispanic, or Asian Cabinet members, Kasich said: \"I don't look at things from the standpoint of any of these sort of metrics that people tend to focus on, race or age, or any of those things. It's not the way I look at things... I want the best possible team I can get.\" Shortly afterward, on February 2, 2011, Kasich made his first minority appointment to the Cabinet, naming Michael Colbert, a black man, to lead the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.Aaron Marshall, Gov.

In a November 2010 letter to Kasich, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the 2009 economic stimulus act for high-speed rail, and could not be used for other purposes. In a December 2010 meeting with President Barack Obama, Kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money for freight rail rather than high-speed rail.Jack Torry & Mark Niquette, Kasich pitches his $400M rail plan to Obama, Dayton Daily News (December 3, 2010). In December 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that Ohio would lose the $385 million in grant funds allocated for high-speed passenger rail, since Kasich had informed them that he had no intention of ever building high-speed rail projects.Stephen Koff, Feds to Ohio: Your high- speed rail project is officially dead (and New York thanks you), Cleveland Plain Dealer (December 10, 2010). (Almost $15 million had already been spent for preliminary engineering.) The $385 million was instead diverted to other states, such as California, New York, and Florida, which planned high-speed rail using the grant money for its congressionally intended purpose. Outgoing governor Ted Strickland, who championed the project, expressed disappointment, saying that the loss of funding for the project was \"one of the saddest days during my four years as governor\" and that \"I can't understand the logic of giving up these vital, job-creating resources to California and Florida at a time when so many Ohioans need jobs.\" Kasich is an opponent of the Cincinnati Streetcar project.Joe Wessels, Cincinnati streetcar state funding nixed by Ohio agency, Reuters (April 12, 2011).Kasich: Can't 'justify' streetcar money, Cincinnati Enquirer (March 11, 2011). In April 2015, Kasich signed a two-year transportation budget bill which allocated $7.06 billion for highway construction and maintenance, $600 million to local governments for road and bridge projects, and an additional million over the last budget for public transportation.Robert Higgs, John Kasich signs transportation budget that targets billions for roadwork, bolsters driver safety (video), Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 1, 2015). ===Voting rights=== In February 2014, Kasich signed into law a bill which cut six days from Ohio's early voting period, including the \"golden week\" (a period at the beginning of early voting when voters could both register to vote and cast an in-person absentee ballot).Robert Higgs, Kasich signs voting bills that end Golden Week and limit distribution of absentee ballots, Cleveland Plain Dealer (February 21, 2014).Zachary Roth, Kasich to sign restrictive Ohio voting bills, MSNBC (February 21, 2015). The measures were hotly contested in the state legislature, passing on a party- line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.Reid Wilson, Ohio Republicans move to curb early, absentee voting, Washington Post (February 20, 2014). This measure prompted two federal lawsuits.Robert Higgs, New federal lawsuit targets changes in Ohio voting laws, Cleveland Plain Dealer (May 11, 2015). The first lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018.Robert Higgs, ACLU, Secretary of State Jon Husted settle federal lawsuit over access to early voting in Ohio, Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 20, 2015). The second lawsuit, Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, was brought in May 2015 by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias; plaintiffs argued that the Ohio bill eliminating \"golden week\" violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately burdened black, Latino and young voters. The federal district court agreed and struck down the legislation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision in a 2-1 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. *Darrel Rowland, Federal lawsuit filed against Ohio's voting system, Columbus Dispatch (May 11, 2015). *Robert Barnes, The crusade of a Democratic superlawyer with multimillion-dollar backing, Washington Post (August 7, 2016). *David A.

In July 2015, Kasich said that it was \"pure demagoguery\" for Hillary Clinton to \"say that there are Republicans who are deliberately trying to keep people from voting.\"Darrel Rowland, Hillary Clinton draws ire of John Kasich on voting, Columbus Dispatch (June 6, 2015). In April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver's license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state.Zachary Roth, John Kasich blocks GOP scheme to target student voting, MSNBC (April 2, 2015).Chrissie Thompson, Kasich vetoes GOP's college-voting provision, Cincinnati Enquirer (May 13, 2015).Editorial: Gov. John Kasich's veto of college-voting restriction does the right thing for Ohio, Cleveland Plain Dealer (April 3, 2015). The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a \"poll tax\" motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting. ===Judicial appointments=== In Ohio, justices of the Ohio Supreme Court are elected, but the governor can fill unexpired terms. In May 2012, Ohio Supreme Court Associate Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton announced she would retire at the end of 2012. In December 2012, Kasich appointed Judge Judith L. French to Stratton's unexpired term, which ran from January 1, 2013, through January 1, 2015. ===Impeachment of Donald Trump=== On October 18, 2019, Kasich publicly stated that Donald Trump should be impeached. He had previously said there was not enough evidence to impeach the President. == 2016 presidential campaign == Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsing John Kasich for President. In April 2015, Kasich announced the formation of his \"New Day For America\" group. Formerly a 527 group, it filed as a super PAC in July 2015.Daniel Strauss, John Kasich super PAC raises more than $11 million, Politico (July 31, 2015). Between April 20 and June 30, 2015, the super PAC raised over $11.1 million from 165 \"reportable contributions,\" including 34 contributions of $100,000 or more. Major contributors to the PAC include Floyd Kvamme, who donated $100,000, and Jim Dicke, chairman emeritus of Crown Equipment Corporation, who donated $250,000. According to FEC filings, Kasich's campaign had $2.5 million on hand at the beginning of 2016.Jeremy Fugleberg, Kasich campaign warchest: $2.5 million, Cincinnati Enquirer (February 1, 2016). In May 2015, sources close to him had said he was \"virtually certain\" to run for the Republican nomination for president. On July 21, 2015, Kasich announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech at the Ohio Union, the student union of his alma mater, the Ohio State University. On January 30, 2016, the New York Times endorsed Kasich for the Republican nomination. The Times editorial board strongly rebuked leading candidates Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz and wrote that Kasich, \"though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.\" On the campaign trail, Kasich sought to project a sunny, optimistic message, describing himself as \"the prince of light and hope.\"Thomas Kaplan, With Calm and Experience, John Kasich Connects in New Hampshire, New York Times (January 22, 2016).Robert Costa, Ohio Gov. John Kasich heads to early primary state of South Carolina, Washington Post (February 11, 2015). This marked a change in tone for Kasich, who had developed a reputation as an abrasive governor.Erick Trickey, How Mean Old John Kasich Became Mr. Nice: Ohio's famously abrasive governor ditches the tough talk to convince New Hampshire voters he's the anti-Trump, Politico Magazine (February 3, 2016). Viewed as a long-shot contender, Kasich took an \"above-the-fray approach to his rivals\" and \"ran unapologetically as a candidate with experience\" even as others ran as \"outsider\" contenders. Kasich came in second place in the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, behind winner Trump. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that this was \"the best possible result\" for Kasich and lent \"credence to the notion that he can emerge\" as a Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz. Ultimately, however, Kasich's message \"never caught on in a campaign that ... exposed the anger and frustration coursing through the electorate\" and he \"found himself stuck in fourth place in a three-man race, trailing Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the delegate count\" although Rubio had dropped out of the race in March. The only state won by Kasich was his home state of Ohio, which gave him 66 delegates in its March 2016 winner-take-all primary but still left him with \"a steep delegate deficit against his rivals.\"Alan Rappeport, John Kasich Wins Ohio, His Home State, New York Times (March 15, 2016). Kasich's unsuccessful campaign strategy hinged on the possibility of a contested (or brokered) Republican National Convention, in which no single candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, something that has not happened in either of the two major parties' presidential nominating conventions since 1952.Tim Reid, Kasich Banks on Contested Convention to Win GOP Nomination, Reuters (March 14, 2016). Kasich suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on May 4, 2016, one day after Trump won the Republican primary in Indiana. The third remaining contender, Cruz, quit the race shortly before Kasich did, leaving Trump as the only candidate remaining in the Republican field and hence the party's presumptive nominee. A 2018 study on media coverage of the 2016 election noted \"the paradox of the Kasich campaign's longevity while it lacked public interest provides some evidence for the idea that Kasich's biggest supporters were the media\". ===Aftermath=== Following his withdrawal from the race, Kasich did not extend his support to Trump. In May and June 2016, Kasich said that Trump was a divisive figure rather than a \"unifier,\" stated that he had no plans to endorse Trump in the near future, and ruled out the possibility of seeking the Vice Presidency as Trump's running mate.Chrissie Thompson, John Kasich 'undecided' on backing Donald Trump, won't serve as VP, Cincinnati Enquirer (May 17, 2016).Eliza Collins, Kasich still not endorsing Trump, won't be his VP, USA Today (June 9, 2016). Kasich stated that it was \"hard to say\" whether he would ever endorse Trump; he added: \"I can't go for dividing, name calling, or somebody that doesn't really represent conservative principles.\"Kailani Koenig, John Kasich: 'Hard to Say' If I Will Ever Endorse Donald Trump, NBC News (June 9, 2016). Kasich said that he had ruled out voting for Hillary Clinton, but lacked the enthusiasm to fully back Trump. In August 2016, Kasich repeated an earlier claim that the Trump campaign had offered him a powerful vice presidency, \"putting him in charge of all domestic and foreign policy\". The Trump campaign denied that such an offer had been made. Kasich also doubted whether Trump could win Ohio, a critical state in the election. Later that month, Trump ally and conspiracy theorist Roger Stone claimed that Kasich would rig the Ohio vote to allow Hillary Clinton to win the state. It was speculated that Kasich was looking towards a 2020 campaign, with the expectation that Trump would be defeated in the 2016 campaign. This speculation was strengthened by a report that Kasich had planned to give a speech to the American Enterprise Institute less than 48 hours after the election but cancelled it the morning after the election when it was clear that Trump had won. Kasich received an electoral vote for the presidency from one faithless elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, who had been pledged to vote for Trump. An elector in Colorado also attempted to vote for him, but that vote was discarded; the elector was replaced by an alternate elector who voted, as pledged, for Hillary Clinton. ==Opposition to Trump== In February 2017, Kasich met with Trump at the White HouseHenry J. Gomez, President Donald Trump will meet with Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Friday. But whose idea was it?, Cleveland.com (February 21, 2017). in a private meeting that followed a bitter feud.Deirdre Shesgreen, After bitter feud, Kasich and Trump try to mend fences, USA Today (February 24, 2017). Kasich indicated that he hoped for Trump's success, but would continue to be critical when he thought it was necessary. The same month, Kasich's chief political advisors launched a political group, Two Paths America, in an effort to promote Kasich and his views and draw a contrast with Trump.Henry J. Gomez, John Kasich's allies launch political organization to promote his vision (and to counter Trump's), Cleveland.com (February 10, 2017). In April 2017, Kasich also released a book, Two Paths: America Divided or United, written with Daniel Paisner.Philip Rucker, Kasich to publish 'Two Paths,' a book offering a contrast to Trump's America, Washington Post (January 31, 2017).Martha Wexler, Ohio Gov. John Kasich on America's Division and Rising Above 'Self-Absorption', NPR, Morning Edition (April 26, 2017). The creation of the group prompted speculation he could possibly run for president again, but Kasich said that he had no plans to seek elected office in the future.Eli Watkins, John Kasich says he's not running for office again, CNN (March 26, 2017). In April 2017, during a CNN town hall, Kasich, while stating that he was \"very unlikely\" to do so, reopened the possibility that he might run for president in 2020. On August 20, however, he reiterated his previous statement that he had no plans to run; rather, he stated that he was \"rooting for [Trump] to get it together.\" In October 2017, during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Kasich said he had not \"given up\" on the Republican Party, but added that \"if the party can't be fixed ... I'm not going to be able to support the party. Period. That's the end of it.\"Eli Watkins, Kasich hints at leaving GOP if it's not 'fixed', CNN (October 1, 2017).Erica Pandey, Kasich: If GOP \"can't be fixed,\" I can't support it, Axios (October 2, 2017). In March 2018, he told The Weekly Standard that he is \"increasingly open\" to running for president in the 2020 presidential election. In October 2019, Kasich expressed support for the impeachment inquiry against Trump, saying that the \"final straw\" for him was when Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted that Trump had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine in part to pressure the country to investigate Trump's domestic political rivals, a statement that Mulvaney later said were misconstrued.Kasich calls for Trump's impeachment, CNN Newsroom (October 18, 2019).'Final straw': GOP ex-Ohio Gov. Kasich supports impeachment, Associated Press (October 18, 2019). Kasich confirmed on August 10, 2020, that he would be speaking at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Kasich said that his conscience compelled him to speak out against Trump and in support of Biden, even if it resulted in blowback against him, adding, \"I've been a reformer almost all of my life. I've been very independent and I'm a Republican but the Republican Party has always been my vehicle but never my master. You have to do what you think is right in your heart and I'm comfortable here.\" ==Personal life== Kasich during his tenure in Congress Kasich has been married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Lee Griffith from 1975 to 1980, and they had no children. Griffith has campaigned for Kasich since their divorce. Kasich and his current wife, Karen Waldbillig, a former public relations executive, were married in March 1997 and have twin daughters, Emma and Reese. Kasich was raised a Catholic, but considers denominations irrelevant, while stating that \"there's always going to be a part of me that considers myself a Catholic.\" He drifted away from his religion as an adult, but came to embrace an Anglican faith after his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver on August 20, 1987.Cathy Lynn Grossman, 5 faith facts about Gov. John Kasich: 'God is with me wherever I happen to be', Religion News Service (July 21, 2015). He joined the Episcopal Church (United States) as an adult. Kasich has said he \"doesn't find God in church\" but does belong to St. Augustine's in Westerville, Ohio, which is part of the Anglican Church in North America, a conservative church with which he remained when it broke off from the Episcopal Church (United States). ==Electoral history== {|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" ! colspan=\"21\" style=\"background:#ccf;\" |Election results |- !Year !Office !Election !Candidate !Party !Votes !% !Opponent !Party !Votes !% !Opponent !Party !Votes !% |- |1982 |U.S. House of Representatives |General | |John Kasich | |Republican | |88,335 | |50% | |Bob Shamansky | |Democratic | |82,753 | |47% | |Russell A.
