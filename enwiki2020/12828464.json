Around 1967, KFH-FM moved to 97.9 MHz and became known as \"Channel 97.\" Channel 97 broadcast with the \"progressive rock\" music format. It was also affiliated with ABC's American FM Radio Network. In late 1971, KFH-FM dropped the progressive rock format and switched to a \"beautiful music\" format and the call letters KBRA. (That station is now KRBB, and owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..) The KFH-FM calls were retired on October 12, 2016. 98.7 FM was issued a construction permit on March 27, 1992, issued as KSQB. The station signed on July 4, 1995 with a Country format as KSPG, \"The Kansas Pig\", and then a satellite-fed Hot AC format as KAYY. On March 24, 2000, 98.7 became the new home of Smooth Jazz KWSJ. The format was moved from its temporary frequency at 92.7 and was originally on 105.3 (Now Hot AC KFBZ-FM). KWSJ's Smooth Jazz format was dropped on March 25, 2002, and flipped to a simulcast with AM sister station KFH.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-03-22.pdf On May 9, 2011, KFH AM and -FM changed their format to sports talk. During the summer of 2016, KFH-AM began simulcasting on translator K248CY 97.5 FM in Wichita, enabling the station to be heard on 3 separate frequencies (97.5/98.7 FM & 1240 AM). However, it offered a more stable signal in the eastern part of the Wichita Metropolitan Area. Entercom announced in October of that year that KNSS would be taking over the 98.7 frequency, giving Wichita its first full-power FM news/talk station since May 2011, when KFH dropped News/Talk in favor of a Sports format. The switch has not come without controversy, though, as listeners in the Anthony, Harper, Hutchinson and Winfield/Arkansas City areas are not able to receive the 97.5 frequency well, if at all. ==References== ==External links== *KNSS official website Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States NSS-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Kansas Category:Entercom radio stations ",
